SPORTS COLUMN: SOAP OPERA CONTINUES FOR KNICKS
</HEADLINE>
  By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ They didn't have to hand out a description of the
injury to tell us it was something to worry about. You could see it
by the way Dr. Norman Scott solemnly knelt by Patrick Ewing's
injured right foot, and you knew it from Ewing's vacant stare. By
now, we know that look and we all know the drill, along with the
familiar sad walk to the locker room and out of another playoff
game.
</P>
<P>
   It came six minutes and change into the first quarter, and
everyone who lived through last spring was amazed by the irony.
Game 2, Eastern Conference finals, at Indianapolis. A year ago,
Ewing played with a slight tear of his left Achilles', played right
until he missed a shot at the buzzer that sent the series back to
New York tied at one.
</P>
<P>
   As Ewing left the old Market Square Arena floor that night with
an eerie howl, we didn't know he would not play another minute in
the postseason. This time, his slow limp from the bench Thursday
night offered no long-range clues. The injury, called a sprained
peroneal tendon, is not to the bottom of the foot _ though it turns
out he missed practice on Wednesday with discomfort there as well.
</P>
<P>
   What we do know is that Ewing has had a high tolerance for pain.
Yet minutes into the second quarter came the announcement that he
was done for the night, and the Knicks went on to lose, 88-84, to
trail the Eastern Conference finals, 2-0. Ewing will undergo an MRI
Friday in New York.
</P>
<P>
   So here we go again and, when you really think about it, when
you consider the previous series, the Knicks were already on the
same road they roamed last spring. It is always a soap opera with
this team, one thing or another. The last three years with Ewing
have been worthy of a weekly prime-time hour. And the Knicks
without their 37-year-old center, well, they have never been Home
and Garden material either.
</P>
<P>
   If you made some of them take a lie-detector test, you would
probably learn that at least half believe, or want to believe, that
they are better off without him. Sometimes they are, for a night or
two. They did shrug off the big man's departure Thursday night and
dragged the Pacers into one of those physical death struggles that
give Pat Riley goosebumps.
</P>
<P>
   After their 102 points and 10 3-pointers in Game 1, the Pacers
weren't exactly giving a repeat perimeter performance to begin
with. This time, Austin Croshere short-armed so many jumpers you
thought his right arm was going to crack at the elbow. This time,
until the fourth quarter, Rik Smits looked closer to retirement
than he did to the finals, and Dale Davis didn't take a first-half
shot, and the Pacers' jump shooters consequently had more hands in
their faces.
</P>
<P>
   It is a fact that certain areas of the floor open up when Ewing
disappears. Larry Johnson slid into his customary spot on the post
and had himself an ``L'' of a time, spinning into the teeth of the
Indiana defense for a game-high 25 points. Marcus Camby suddenly
rediscovered his high-wire muse. There was even a Chris Dudley
sighting, for those wondering what had become of the $7 million
backup center.
</P>
<P>
   If history is repeating with Ewing, then, of course, the Knicks
will want to believe they can come back against these enigmatic
Pacers, with or without him. They won against all odds last year.
Yet if Ewing's injury isn't a temporary setback, then it should be
obvious to all that the last words the Knicks want to hear from him
is, ``Go get me my ring.'' After last year, they ought to already
know they can't get it without him.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing hasn't been their centerpiece for a long time now. When
he's played, when he's been in shape and in sync with the others,
he has been their missing piece. After 18 rebounds in Game 6 of the
Miami series, after 20 points and the winning basket in Game 7, one
television commentator actually said that Ewing was playing better
than ever. It was, of course, nonsense. This is a player who, in
his youth, would routinely drop 30 on teams in the playoffs. But in
the context of this Knicks team, playing for what it always wants
to believe are championship stakes, Ewing's contributions have
seemed more substantial, more heroic, than ever.
</P>
<P>
   With all the ice packs after every game and practice, with the
rebuilt wrist and scraggly knees, Ewing had been, for him, the
picture of health, at least until this week. When he returned in
December, the debate about whether the Knicks were better off with
him or without him resumed. For the big picture, the championship
the Knicks have not won since 1972, there is no debate. Friday
morning, there is only a soap opera we have seen before.

STUDENTS IN FREE ENTERPRISE TAKES ITS MISSION WORLDWIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   When Students in Free Enterprise was
founded a quarter of a century ago, its creators were seeking a way
to rekindle the interest of young Americans in the magic of the
marketplace.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now the group's looming challenge is how best to take its
mission global.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of capitalism that had looked so bright in the 1960s
had by the mid-1970s turned to the dross of stagflation and bear
markets. As the economy foundered and America's fortunes waned,
government action was increasingly misperceived as the answer to
society's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of SIFE, as that fledgling group came to be known, has
progressed in tandem with the resurgence of free enterprise's
popularity. Not only has the past decade brought unprecedented
prosperity to U.S. society, but also it has been accompanied by the
emergence of worker capitalism. Whereas a generation or two ago
stock ownership was almost entirely the province of ruling-class
plutocrats, stock investing has since also become the realm of
opportunity for those who provide the labor.
</P>
<P>
   It's stretching things to say SIFE was the most influential
factor in the rebirth of appreciation for what free markets can
achieve. The creation of Students in Free Enterprise, however, was
a symbolically critical part of the overall process.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after SIFE's founding, eight regional teams competed
in its first national competition in Dallas. By 1982, just as the
national economy was hitting rock bottom, the future of a shrinking
SIFE was problematic.
</P>
<P>
   Then a couple of things happened. The policies of a presidential
administration committed to the ``magic of the marketplace'' began
to revive a long-moribund economy just about the time a dynamic
young guy by the name of Alvin Rohrs became SIFE's president.
</P>
<P>
   This week at Kansas City, Mo.'s Bartle Hall, Rohrs presided over
an international exposition and career fair involving about 1,200
students from 158 colleges around the world. The list of the
competition's hundreds of judges reads like a who's who of U.S.
corporate leadership.
</P>
<P>
   SIFE's reach now extends to 700 campuses in America and a dozen
foreign countries, where teams promote the credo that ``hard work
pays, free markets work, democracy leads to prosperity and freedom
brings social responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most interesting recent developments is SIFE's
expanding presence in Russia, which is struggling to make the
transition from command economy to market economy. There is no
societal memory of how free enterprise works in Russia, which puts
SIFE members there in the role of helping create from scratch the
emerging free enterprise culture.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian SIFE member related how the student members there
often become their parents' teachers when it comes to acquainting
Russia's oldsters with the ins and outs of free enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Another innovative outreach effort was made by a SIFE chapter in
California, which set up a ``cow bank'' in a village in India. The
project involved buying cows and lending them to villagers, who
consumed some of the milk and sold what they didn't consume to
increase family income.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a quintessential example not only of SIFE's bent for
entrepreneurial ingenuity, but also its emerging global
orientation. (30)

MANY LAKES, RIVERS ARE LOW IN KANSAS, MISSOURI BECAUSE OF DRY
WEATHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRAHAM  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ You won't find many
holiday weekends where most people hope for rain, but this is one.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because as people head outdoors to celebrate Memorial Day, in
the middle of flood season, they'll find many streams and small
lakes withered into shallow, late-summer conditions by a regional
drought in Missouri and northeast Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   So a National Weather Service forecast for possible
thunderstorms in the region today, early Saturday and next week is
another cause for celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're banging around at the all-time low water levels for May
on some (Ozark) streams,'' said Loyd Waite, a hydrologist for the
U.S. Geological Survey. ``We're having August flow levels in what's
normally our high-flow month. It's getting really serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Ozark rivers are still floatable, canoe vendors say. Large
federal reservoirs have plenty of water for boating.
</P>
<P>
   But dry conditions during what's normally the flood season could
spell trouble ahead in summer when evaporation rates increase. The
National Weather Service long-range forecast predicts higher
temperatures and lower rainfall than normal for this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan on Wednesday activated a drought
assistance team for agriculture and environmental problems. North
Missouri rivers and water supply lakes are low. Several Ozark float
streams are at record low levels for May, 3 feet low on the
Gasconade River in Phelps County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely experiencing August-like conditions in May,
not only in water level, but the (water) temperatures are higher
and there's more moss and algae than usual,'' said Stephen Zap, a
Missouri Department of Conservation agent in Phelps County. ``It
really looks like late summer on the river, and a bad late summer
at that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City area, ponds and community lakes that missed
recent showers are shrinking and leaving pontoon boats on mud
flats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're down about three and a half feet,'' said Ken Richcreek,
Lake Waukomis Association president. ``There are some who have
their boats and docks on dry ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Water flows in northeast Kansas rivers are far below normal. The
Kansas Water Office on Thursday announced that some farmers without
first-use water rights could no longer draw irrigation water from
the upper Republican and Delaware river systems until rains
recharge the streams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anything that can compare with this spring
for dryness,'' said Bill Bunting, a meteorologist at the National
Weather Service in Pleasant Hill, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Only 2.47 inches of rain has fallen at the Kansas City
International Airport this month in scattered showers, compared
with the 5.04 inches normal for May.
</P>
<P>
   Some areas are drier. Bunting's rain gauge at his home in Lee's
Summit, Mo., has recorded less than 0.10 inches this month. A
barely damp May followed bone-dry April's 0.65 inches of rainfall,
a record low. That's after a mild and dry winter, and that's left
Kansas City 8.44 inches below normal for rainfall in the past 10
months.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a year makes.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service in Pleasant Hill has issued fewer
than 10 flood warnings this spring for the Kansas City region
compared with 150 last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, if we're going to get rain at any time of year, this
is it,'' Bunting said.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of upper-level disturbances, moist air and cool
fronts today and next week are the area's best chance in some time
for thunderstorms, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Few canoeists will complain.
</P>
<P>
   The middle and lower segments of Missouri's float streams have
enough water for canoeists, especially those fed by large springs.
</P>
<P>
   But canoes are crunching across riffle gravel on smaller
headwater streams that are normally flush with water in late
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to get in the upper Niangua because you'll have
ankle deep water in some places where normally you have waist-deep
water or better,'' said Alan Daniels, a Missouri Department of
Conservation agent for Dallas County. ``For the 13 years that I've
been here, it's as low as I've seen it for this time of year.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels said the water level is not critical yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if we don't get the June rains, it will be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen can still enjoy pools in the river's upper reaches if
they're willing to drag canoes through riffles, Daniels said, and
the Niangua below Bennett Spring, Mo., has plenty of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those rope swings that hang out over the water,'' he said,
``I'd shy away from them because of the shallow conditions unless
you physically check them.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation is similar across Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Spring-fed streams like the Current River in the Ozark National
Scenic Riverways still have enough water flow for good canoeing,
park officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Canoe vendor Shane Van Steenis is launching float trippers on
both the Current River and the Jack's Fork River below Alley
Spring. But this month he halted floats on the Jack's Fork above
Alley Spring due to low water, something that usually doesn't
happen until mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had much rain,'' Van Steenis said. ``We need it and
we need it bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong rains can quickly rejuvenate stream flow. Although
Missouri needs major rains to return all soil moisture and water
levels to normal.
</P>
<P>
   If the rains don't come, fish kills likely will occur in small
ponds, shallow lakes and some rivers due to low oxygen and nutrient
buildup, said Steve Eder, a fisheries biologist for the Missouri
Department of Conservation. As is, shallow water will allow small
fish to be more easily eaten by predators and reproduction success
will diminish. So fishermen could eventually find fewer fish in
some waters in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   The department also had to move 50,000 catfish fingerlings from
its Blind Pony Fish Hatchery near Sweet Springs, Mo., because a
water supply lake was low, Eder said. Fish were moved from cold
water trout hatcheries at parks like Roaring River State Park
during the winter because of low spring water flow, and that may
happen again this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The drought also affects creeks that serve upland areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the biggest concern is if the weather pattern
continues much longer, it could be severe for the fish and wildlife
along those smaller tributaries and ponds,'' said Roger Wolfe of
Topeka, Kan., a regional fisheries and wildlife supervisor for the
Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks.
</P>
<P>
   As is, more than 140 farmers in northeast and north-central
Kansas will be cut off from irrigation supply until the drought
ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flow on the Republican River is running about 11 percent of
normal and on the Delaware River it's 8 percent of normal,'' said
Earl Lewis, an engineer for the Kansas Water Office.
</P>
<P>
   Western and southern Kansas have had enough rains to keep stream
flow normal. But the eastern areas need several rains before the
ground will become saturated enough to provide runoff for streams,
Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about a couple of days of rain to get well,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's not currently in the forecast, only scattered
thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   But Missouri canoe trip operators like Van Steenis will be
watching for dark clouds and hoping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to have faith that it's going to rain,'' he
said. (30)

EDITORIAL: NUCLEAR SWORDS AND SHIELDS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, May 26:
</P>
<P>
   It seems fitting that the first presidential campaign of the new
century should confront the most dangerous military legacy of the
last century, nuclear arms. Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President
Al Gore initiated an important and healthy debate in recent days
about how best to reduce nuclear arsenals and diminish the threat
of an accidental or intentional nuclear conflict. America's
security will be best protected if the next president moves boldly
to cut nuclear arms without suddenly overturning the carefully
calibrated balance between offensive and defensive weapons that has
long been central to preserving the peace.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, like Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, is impatient with the
balance. The impulse is understandable. The primary deterrent to
war is the chilling notion of mutual assured destruction, which
requires Washington and Moscow to maintain sufficient nuclear
firepower to annihilate one another. That balance of terror has
always been unsettling and should be supplanted by a less
threatening calculus. Placing a greater emphasis on defensive
systems, as Bush proposes, is alluring.
</P>
<P>
   But there are disabling problems with Bush's desire to make an
antimissile shield a centerpiece of his nuclear strategy. For one
thing, the technology to destroy even a handful of incoming
warheads in outer space remains elusive. Intercepting just one
warhead has proved difficult in recent tests. For another, an
abrupt shift to defensive strategies would invite Moscow to
increase its nuclear arsenal to insure it could overwhelm even a
limited a American antimissile system.
</P>
<P>
   Though such matters of nuclear theology may seem anachronistic
eight years after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, they
cannot be escaped. Even at a time of cooperation, the United States
and Russia possess thousands of nuclear weapons that must be
responsibly managed. It is in neither nation's interest to make the
other feel less secure.
</P>
<P>
   But that is just the risk that Bush takes by emphasizing the
immediate development of a robust antimissile defense. Apart from
questions of cost and technology _ the United States has already
wasted billions of dollars chasing this goal _ Bush's approach will
tempt Washington to break out of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile
Treaty. The pact limits the defensive systems that Washington and
Moscow can construct. An American breakout would unravel the arms
control work of six presidents, and encourage China to join a new
arms race to overcome the shield.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bush's own arms reduction proposals would be threatened.
Many of the ideas he presented this week were constructive and
creative. Bush made clear his commitment to seek deeper cuts than
those provided under the last arms reduction treaty. The 1993
agreement requires Washington and Moscow to slash the number of
long-range warheads from roughly 6,000 on each side to half that
count. Bush seemed comfortable with eventually leaving each country
with 2,000 to 2,500 long-range weapons. Drawing on the positive
example his father set as president, Bush also said he would
consider eliminating some American missiles and lowering the alert
status of others on his own to encourage Moscow to respond in kind.
</P>
<P>
   Given the potential threat of a missile attack from rogue
nations like North Korea, the United States should be seeking to
develop a limited defensive system against such an assault, which
the Clinton administration is doing. But Washington must proceed
with care by working with Moscow to reopen the ABM treaty rather
than withdrawing from it. The next president should avoid reliance
on expensive and unworkable antimissile technologies and not take
steps that would lead Russia to rearm. &QL;

EDITORIAL: JUDICIAL REFORMS IN ALBANY
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, May 26:
</P>
<P>
   Scarlett O'Hara would have felt right at home in New York
state's Legislature, where lawmakers habitually put off action on
important matters for another day. But some issues involving the
state's justice system cannot wait. Proposals by Gov. George Pataki
and others for tougher gun laws merit prompt attention, as do the
Rockefeller drug laws, which deserve repeal. Here is an abbreviated
list of other vital court and criminal justice reforms needing
attention before the Legislature closes shop in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   Court restructuring. Three years after Chief Judge Judith Kaye
unveiled her sensible plan to consolidate and simplify New York's
archaic court system, Pataki seems serious about making court
reform finally happen. But he will have to beat back attempts to
preserve patronage by exempting Surrogate's Court from the
reorganization. The next few weeks are critical. The overhaul
requires amending the State Constitution, meaning it must be
approved by two separate elected Legislatures _ this one and the
one to be chosen in November _ before it gets put before voters.
</P>
<P>
   Assigned counsel fees. Regrettably, the governor and the
Legislature overlooked pleas to raise the fees for attorneys
assigned to represent indigent defendants _ the so-called 18-B
rates _ when they fashioned a state budget last month. These fees
have not been raised for 14 years, which has led to a mass exodus
of experienced attorneys willing to take assigned counsel work, and
a major disruption in the processing of cases. A way must be found
to finance the modest increase Kaye has proposed, perhaps by
splitting the added expense between the state and localities.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras in the courtroom. The wise decision by State Supreme
Court Justice Joseph Teresi to allow televised coverage of the
Amadou Diallo murder trial in Albany has underscored the
Legislature's error when it let the state's successful 10-year
experiment with cameras in the courtroom lapse in 1997. The task
now is to revive _ on a permanent basis and without weakening
restrictions _ the proven program of televised access to judicial
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual assault law reform. New York's law dealing with sexual
assault needs updating to recognize the seriousness of ``date
rape,'' change antiquated terminology and address other problems.
The State Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, recently introduced a
promising reform package, opening the door for serious negotiations
with the governor and the Senate. Progress now depends largely on
the governor's willingness to drop _ at least for now _
controversial parts of his 52-point Sexual Assault Reform Act that
are anathema to the Assembly, such as giving prosecutors the right
to appeal sentences and bail decisions.
</P>
<P>
   DNA tests and statutes of limitations. Pataki has shown a
laudable interest in taking advantage of DNA technology to improve
the criminal justice system. He recently proposed a new state DNA
Review Committee to examine all convictions in New York that were
overturned because of new genetic evidence. But his call for ending
the statute of limitations for all class B violent felony offenses
is too broad. A sound compromise would lift the statute of
limitations for rape and a limited number of other violent offenses
in which decisive biological evidence would most likely be present.

<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ The government of President Alberto Fujimori said
Thursday that a runoff presidential election would be held on
Sunday as scheduled despite nationwide protests and calls from
Washington and other allies that it be postponed to assure a clean
ballot count.
</P>
<P>
   Unless reversed, the decision appeared to increase the
possibility of economic sanctions against Peru after it ignored the
recommendations of the Clinton administration, the Organization of
American States and several European and Latin American
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of the announcement, violent clashes that had
left several people injured earlier in the day resumed, with
protesters setting fire to a balcony of the presidential palace and
hurling stones at the building and at the police, who responded
with tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   During intense negotiations all week, U.S. and Latin American
diplomats had urged Peruvian officials to delay the vote so a
computer system used to count the vote could be overhauled and
rechecked by independent auditors.
</P>
<P>
   A brief announcement that the National Elections Committee had
voted 3-2 to go forward with the election was met with shock by
international observers who had become increasingly hopeful that
Fujimori had decided to given in to international pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are quite disappointed,'' said Eduardo Stein, head of an
election observer team for the Organization of American States,
``because other options were being intensively considered.'' He
added, ``It's been a terrible week.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday night, the Organization of American States
announced that it was withdrawing its monitors from the election
Sunday, a few hours after the Atlanta-based Carter center said it
was doing so.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. Embassy official said of the Fujimori decision:
``The U.S. government deeply regrets this outcome. Even a
relatively brief delay would have put the Organization of American
States in a position to speak to the integrity of the election
results.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori had appeared to be going back and forth on the election
scheduling during the past three days, but western diplomats said
that mounting protests had perhaps strengthened the hand of
hard-liners in the government.
</P>
<P>
   Just Wednesday night, Fujimori had said in an interview in the
government palace that ``the possibility for an adjustment of the
election date exists. We are in a fluctuating situation.'' In an
interview Thursday night, Francisco Tudela, Fujimori's vice
presidential running mate, said that the decision was a ``close
call'' and that the electoral commission ``could not escape the
constitution and the elections law.'' Under the law, he said, the
election could not be held more than 30 days after results of the
first-round presidential vote were announced.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral crisis had been gathering momentum since Alejandro
Toledo, the opposition candidate, dropped out of the race last
Thursday, saying there was no reason to compete in a fraudulent
election. He said he would rejoin the contest if it were postponed
by several weeks, with guarantees for a free vote.
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing Thursday's announcement, Toledo said, ``This will
bring Peru enormous instability, with totally unpredictable
political and economic consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   A wave of strikes and street demonstrations that followed
Toledo's withdrawal from the race peaked Thursday, and grew
increasingly violent.
</P>
<P>
   A small group of protesters attacked the offices of the National
Elections Commission, the highest government body that supervises
the elections, and broke windows and damaged a door with rocks,
pipes and at least one Molotov cocktail. Scores of people were
arrested in the northern jungle city of Iquitos for blocking roads,
and police used tear gas to clear protesters gathering in front of
the government palace here in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Truck drivers and teachers staged a strike in the Andean city of
Cuzco, a Toledo stronghold. Bands of university students in Lima
and Arequipa repeatedly attacked riot police officers with stones,
and the police counterattacked with tear gas through much of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a growing number of influential businessmen had
warned that holding the uncontested election on Sunday could mean
years of economic sanctions and tensions with Washington that could
impede investment and growth. Their arguments were strengthened
through the week as Peruvian bond and stock prices dropped sharply
and foreign financial institutions issued risk warnings that
threatened to increase interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the government's policies on the campaign and
political process have been inconsistent. Several television
stations allied with the government had begun airing Toledo
commercials and coverage of his rallies, while tabloid newspapers
thought to be directed by Fujimori's intelligence service has
softened their negative coverage of Toledo's personal life.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, three unidentified men Wednesday night broke into
the offices of an opposition journalist said to hold incriminating
videotapes of Vladimiro Montesinos, Fujimori's intelligence chief,
meeting with election officials. The journalist, Fabian Salazar,
said the burglars tied him up and tortured him as they demanded
that he reveal his sources within the intelligence service who gave
him copies of the tapes that apparently were made by Montesinos
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar said they cut through his left wrist to the bone with a
saw during their questioning. He was hospitalized after his
videotapes, archives and computer disks were stolen. Human rights
activists said Salazar's descriptions of his ordeal, which were
verified by doctors, may represent the worst example of torture in
Peru in at least two years.

EDITORIAL: A THREAT TO MEAT INSPECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, May 26:
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Texas undermined the safety of the nation's
food supply on Thursday by denying the government's authority to
enforce critical regulations setting limits on the amount of
harmful bacteria in ground beef sold to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The case was the first legal test of the Agriculture
Department's power under the Federal Meat Inspection Act to rely on
new scientific methods, as opposed to the old ``poke and sniff''
tests, to protect consumers from food-borne illness. It arose last
year when the department shut down the Supreme Beef Processors'
plant in Dallas after the plant failed three tests for salmonella
contamination over a period of 12 months. The company sued,
contending that the government lacked authority to enforce its new
regulations, which use excessively high levels of salmonella as an
indicator of an unsanitary plant.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, Thursday's ruling was not surprising. Judge A. Joe
Smith signaled where his sympathies lay last December when he
ignored public health concerns and extended an earlier injunction
allowing the plant to remain open while the case was being
adjudicated. Still, the judge's rejection of the government's use
of salmonella sampling to determine the existence of serious
sanitation problems at a plant was startling.
</P>
<P>
   Under the judge's strange reasoning, a plant that produces
Supreme Beef's dismal salmonella test results might still be
perfectly clean. The judge was troubled by the idea of penalizing a
plant when the meat may already have been contaminated when it
arrived there. Yet nothing requires a plant to accept dangerous
food, and if it does accept bad meat, its grinders will surely
become contaminated while processing it, posing a risk of
contamination to all other food passing through the grinders. That
seems exactly the sort of hazardous condition the statute was
intended to remedy.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of logic and science, the excessive presence of
dangerous salmonella in any meat turned out by a plant should be
deemed evidence that conditions at the plant are unsanitary. The
vast majority of large beef-processing plants in this country have
systems that keep tainted beef out of their plants and are in
compliance with the U.S.D.A. salmonella standards, so it is hardly
unreasonable to ask Supreme Beef Processors to meet the same
salmonella standard.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department is likely to ask for an expedited
appeal of this misguided decision. But Congress could end the
controversy by passing legislation affirming the government's power
to institute its new system of microbial testing and standards for
policing meat safety. It should do so immediately.

YEVGENY KHRUNOV, 67, RUSSIAN ASTRONAUT 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yevgeny Vasilevich Khrunov, an early Russian astronaut who took
part in the first linkup of two manned spacecraft high above the
Earth, has died at the age of 67. In reporting his death from
Moscow on Tuesday, the news agency Itar-Tass said that several of
his fellow astronauts had gathered on the day of his death to mourn
him.
</P>
<P>
   The date, place and cause of death were not given.
</P>
<P>
   Khrunov, then an air force lieutenant colonel and described as
the flight's research engineer, was part of the three-man crew that
went into space on Jan. 15, 1969, aboard a capsule called Soyuz 5.
It was the first Soviet mission to be videotaped and shown on
Soviet television promptly after launching, as well as during the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   At an altitude of about 130 miles, they steered into a
coordinated orbit with a single astronaut aboard Soyuz 4. The two
craft then maneuvered toward a safe docking.
</P>
<P>
   Then Khrunov and a colleague, Aleksei Yeliseyev, a civilian
engineer, donned spacesuits and made history by transferring to
Soyuz 4 after a one-hour walk in space.
</P>
<P>
   The two capsules remained linked for four hours before Khrunov
and the other two astronauts aboard Soyuz 4 returned safely to
earth. Previously, both the American and Soviet space programs had
succeeded only in linking up manned craft with unmanned target
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Khrunov had been a standby in March 1965 for Col. Aleksei A.
Leonov, the Soviet astronaut who was the first man to walk in
space.

FOOTE ALMOST BOOTED GAME WITH PENALTY AGAINST MODANO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Had the Avalanche gone on to lose Game 6 of the Western
Conference Finals on Thursday night, Adam Foote would have spent a
long summer replaying his foolish high stick to the face of Mike
Modano over and over.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty, which came away from the puck, gave the Stars a
5-on-3 power play for 73 seconds. With Chris Drury already serving
a tripping penalty, Brett Hull needed only 47 seconds to beat
Patrick Roy from the left crease to tie the score at 1-1 at the
12:37 mark of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dodged a bullet for the first part, a great pass by (Sergei
Zubov),'' Avs coach Bob Hartley said. ``There was not much you can
do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avs had taken a 1-0 lead eight minutes earlier on Ray
Bourque's first playoff goal. They had already killed an earlier
Stars power play and were 47 seconds away from killing a second and
retaining the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Foote's penalty drastically changed that scenario. Modano had
passed the puck up ice and was making his way to the Avs' zone
along the left-wing board. Foote, always a physical presence,
inadvertently hit Modano with the butt-end of his stick in the face
going for a body check.
</P>
<P>
   With goals at a premium and the Avs facing elimination,
surrendering any kind of man advantage was not wise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't scored enough goals this series and our penalty
kill has to stop their power play,'' Avs winger Dave Reid said
before Game 6. ``Those two factors could change the series.''
</P>
<P>
   It almost did. LOOKING FOR FIREPOWER
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for firepower in the third period, Avs coach Bob
Hartley put wingers Peter Forsberg and Adam Deadmarsh on Joe
Sakic's line. Center Chris Drury was then teamed with wingers Dave
Andreychuk and Milan Hejduk.
</P>
<P>
   That line was on the ice for Drury's game-winner on a shot from
the point by Ray Bourque at the 16:09 mark. POWER PLAY POOR
</P>
<P>
   The Avs continued to perform poorly on the power play. They
squandered three chances in the first two periods.
</P>
<P>
   How much has the man advantage meant to the Avs in the playoffs?
Against Detroit, five of 13 goals came on the power play and 15 of
39 coming into Game 6. The Stars have held them to 3-for-30 in the
series. TAKING HEAT
</P>
<P>
   Avs center Joe Sakic has taken plenty of heat lately from the
local media. A ``Denver Post'' columnist wondered in print
yesterday if the captain's ``C'' on Joe Sakic's sweater didn't
stand for ``choke.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been 20 days since Sakic scored a goal. He has had a
forgettable series, scoring no goals on 23 shots. After coming up
empty on two overtime chances in Game 5, Sakic was asked if he has
ever endured a scoring drought as frustrating as this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, just not in the playoffs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as though Sakic has played poorly. He has been one of
the Avs' best players, but has had a hard time putting the puck in
the net.
</P>
<P>
   He assisted the game-tying goal in Game 5 and fed Ray Bourque on
Thursday night with a perfect in-stride pass to the slot where
Bourque beat Ed Belfour high for the 1-0 lead at the 4:30 mark of
the second period. HEJDUK TURNED BACK
</P>
<P>
   Don't blame Avs winger Milan Hejduk if he has Ed Belfour on the
brain. Hejduk has two goals in the series, but he also has been
stoned on some quality scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
   His fifth shot of Thursday night's game came with less than four
minutes gone in the third period. It had game-winner written all
over it. Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher turned the puck over along
the board below the net. Avs winger Dave Andreychuk got it and fed
Hejduk on top of the crease for a one-timer.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour blocked it with his chest and the Stars cleared it out
of the zone. AVS GOOD IN 6s
</P>
<P>
   The Avs are 7-3 in Game 6s since moving to Colorado for the
1995-96 season. nn

<P>
   Dr. Seymour Perry, a cancer specialist who became an expert in
evaluating medical technology, died on May 19 at his home in
Washington. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was prostate cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, who also served briefly as an assistant surgeon general,
worked from 1961 until 1980 with the National Institutes of Health,
where he was deputy director of the division of cancer treatment
and chief of the branches for human tumor cell biology and for
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   He later became known for evaluating health care systems and
medical technology. For 15 years, he was director of the World
Health Organization's Collaborating Center for Health Technology
Assessment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, he was a founder and the first president of the
International Society for Technology Assessment in Health Care,
which encourages research and the exchange of information on the
clinical and social implications of health care technology.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Perry was named assistant surgeon general. That year he
was named the first director of the National Center for Health Care
Technology, an agency created to determine which new medical
technologies the government should finance through Medicare and
other programs, but the agency was abolished in federal budget
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Perry also served twice with the Public Health Service, from
1952 to 1954 and from 1961 to 1982.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, he was appointed chairman of the department of
community and family medicine at the Georgetown University Medical
Center and director of the center's Institute for Health Care
Research and Policy. He was also professor of medicine and family
medicine at Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York, he graduated from the University of California
at Los Angeles and received his medical degree from the University
of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Perry published more than 250 papers on technology assessment,
cancer and other health issues.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife of 49 years, Judith Perry; two sons,
Grant, of Ridgefield, Conn., and David, of Fulton, Md.; a daughter,
Anne Dunlap of Olney, Md.; a sister, Jean Mandler of Sherman Oaks,
Calif.; and three grandsons.

STARS CONFIDENT THEY'LL PUT AWAY AVALANCHE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Stars did everything they needed to do Thursday
night to close the Western Conference Finals. Except win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played pretty well,'' Stars forward Mike Keane said. ``I
think it was a pretty good game all around. We didn't give up many
shots. Our special teams were good. Eddie (Belfour) was strong. So
back in our building for Game 7.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado center Chris Drury scored the game-winner on a
deflection at 16:09 of the third period, giving the Avalanche a 2-1
victory in Game 6. But while he killed the Stars' chances of
closing a series for the ninth consecutive time they have had a
chance, Drury's goal did nothing to the Stars' spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars figure that's the way the puck bounces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's why the series is seven games,'' Stars winger
Blake Sloan said. ``Sometimes you get a bounce, and sometimes you
don't. I think (Thursday night) we were on the short end of the
stick, but maybe a couple of the other games we won, maybe we
shouldn't have. I think it all balances out in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a Game 7 for the first time since last season's
Western Conference Finals against the Avalanche _ a 4-1 victory for
Dallas _ the Stars are ready to match Colorado's desperation
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing you can say or do right now,'' Stars center
Joe Nieuwendyk said. ``You just have to get yourself ready. It's
going to be a lot of heart and determination and whoever wants it
more will win the series.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the Stars got another goal from Brett Hull, who
has scored five of his team's 11 goals. It came on a 5-on-3, making
the Stars 4-for-25 for the series on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had 27 shots, the most they've had since Game 2, and
held Colorado to 21, the fewest the Avs have had since Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   It might have been the best game the Stars have played all
playoffs. It just wasn't good enough to close the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it gives us confidence,'' Stars defenseman Derian
Hatcher said. ``I think we're confident if we do well and put the
same game on the ice, we'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Stars returned home feeling pretty good about themselves
despite the loss and in spite of the loss of defenseman Richard
Matvichuk to a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   The series is back in the Stars' court, right where they want
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all wanted to win (Thursday night),'' Stars center Mike
Modano said. ``We wanted to come here and get that fourth game and
move on, but that's why home ice is so important. Games 4 and 5
were real big games, and to get home ice and make sure we didn't
lose it, we've put ourselves in a great position. It's one game
takes all now.'' nn

TIME WARNER AND DISNEY REACH CABLE DEAL FOR ABC 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM RUTENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ending one of the most rancorous negotiations in the
history of cable television, Time Warner Inc. and the Walt Disney
Co. completed a deal that allows the cable company to continue
carrying Disney's ABC television stations for the next six years.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney stations reach 3.5 million Time Warner Cable
customers in seven cities, including New York and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides called the deal mutually beneficial. But the
financial terms were not disclosed and estimates of the value of
the deal for Disney varied from $1 billion to $2 billion. Disney
executives would only say they were ``happy'' with the terms.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at America Online and Time Warner acknowledged on
Thursday that they wanted the cable company to reach a deal as soon
as possible, knowing that Time Warner had made a blunder by letting
the dispute become so open that it drew unwanted attention to the
proposed merger between the companies.
</P>
<P>
   In return for permission to carry ABC's signals through May
2006, the cable company agreed to convert the Disney Channel by
2003 from a service that viewers have to pay extra for to one that
is included in their basic package.
</P>
<P>
   It will begin carrying Disney's Toon Disney and SoapNet channels
on some of its systems and expand its distribution of Disney's ESPN
2 and ESPN Classic sports networks.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner also agreed to consider eventually adding two
unspecified Disney channels, which are currently under development,
to some of its systems.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the tensions, Time Warner had said that Disney
was demanding unacceptably exorbitant fees for its cable channels,
which would have forced Time Warner to significantly raise cable
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner executives said on Thursday that the amount of money
that was finally agreed upon was acceptable, that both sides had
compromised and that the cable company would not have to
significantly raise its rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for Time Warner, it's good for Disney and it's good
for our customers,'' said Ed Adler, a Time Warner spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The companies had reached an agreement in principle last week
but completed the details late on Wednesday night, after months of
fingerpointing and accusations of bad faith. Tensions hit a peak on
May 1, when Time Warner halted the programming of the ABC-owned
stations for 39 hours and replaced it with a blue screen with the
statement, ``Disney Has Taken ABC Away from You.''
</P>
<P>
   With that move, Time Warner angered its customers, raised
concerns among federal lawmakers about its pending merger with
America Online and gave Disney a rare chance to publicly play the
role of the victim.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner did win some concessions of its own. Disney dropped
its demand that the company agree not to discriminate against its
offerings after its merger with AOL is approved. Disney has
expressed fears that the new company will wield too much control
over access to both the Internet and cable distribution.
</P>
<P>
   And Time Warner, which now has long-term deals with all of the
major networks, will not have to worry about losing ABC for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Time Warner was maintaining a position of contrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret the way that the dispute unfolded and that it got to
a point where consumers were caught in the middle,'' Adler said.
``We have put this dispute behind us.''

FOR THE KNICKS, AN UNWELCOME FEELING FROM 1999
</HEADLINE>
  By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The longer the second half dragged on, the more
uncomfortable the game grew for the New York Knicks. They had
already lost Patrick Ewing to a sprained right foot. And with less
than a minute left _ and their world beginning to resemble Game 2
against Indiana, 1999 _ they were also about to lose their lead.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller made two free throws with 28 seconds left, putting
the Pacers ahead by two. The wild bunch at Conseco Fieldhouse was
on its feet, screaming ``DEE-fense! DEE-fense!'' One or two more
stops, and Miller and his team could waltz into Madison Square
Garden with a 2-0 series lead.
</P>
<P>
   No one in New York had seen the Knicks at the Garden since their
pulsating comeback against Miami in Game 6 of the semifinal series
last Friday. The players returning home bore no resemblance,
especially after this deflating 88-84 loss.
</P>
<P>
   On their last offensive possession, Latrell Sprewell backed the
6-foot point guard Travis Best down into the post and, with Jalen
Rose sprinting to double team, released a shot that bounced high
off the back rim with 5.8 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Davis rebounded and was immediately fouled. Now, Davis
being a poor free-throw shooter and all, the Knicks were hoping to
get some kind of prayer play to work at the end. But they could not
even get to that point because they botched one of the most
fundamental plays in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Missing the first free-throw badly, Davis also missed the
second. But with only Allan Houston and Sprewell positioned on the
blocks to grab a rebound, Davis went over the top of Charlie Ward,
grabbed his own miss and fed Jalen Rose as the building nearly
imploded with noise.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, one of the league's most resilient teams, had forgot
to block out the shooter. Unreal. No one got the shooter.
</P>
<P>
   After it ended, Sprewell slammed the basketball to the floor.
Camby grabbed the ball and ricocheted it hard off the backboard.
Having come so close to persevering in Ewing's absence again and
pulling off a victory with their grit and heart, they fell victim
to brainlock.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Johnson and Camby and Kurt Thomas turned in great
supporting performances, the kind they will need to duplicate if
Ewing is in fact out for any length of time.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, everything went through Johnson on offense, and it
appeared that was enough for New York. He would back the gangly
Rose into the post, using his brawn and guile to score inside on
left-handed layins or rise for a short fall-away jump shot or draw
a foul and get to the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   He was making every big play imaginable, finding cutting
teammates, moving the ball around the perimeter until someone was
open. But the Pacers kept close, never trailing by more than six in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson finished with 25 points and seven rebounds. Houston,
too, hit several clutch jumpers in the face of Miller, shots that
could have easily demoralized the Pacers. But they showed their
character, too.
</P>
<P>
   Camby awoke from his Game 1 slumber and began hitting the boards
with purpose. He made only 3 of 7 shots, but kept Austin Croshere
in check and made good on his word to become more active and
passionate about going to the glass.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more than any other Knick over the next week, he will
have to morph into a special type of player, slide along the
baseline and follow missed shots, find a way to go up and over
Indiana's frontline.
</P>
<P>
   If Ewing is out, Camby, Johnson, Thomas and Chris Dudley used
sparingly is all they have.
</P>
<P>
   Camby was recently asked if he had thought about attending Pete
Newell's Big Man Camp in Hawaii. The summer clinic, whose alumni
include pivots like Bill Walton, Hakeem Olajuwon and Shaquille
O'Neal, is geared toward improving the skills of the
7-foot-and-over crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' he said. ``Hawaii's too far. I'll stay out here and
work with the coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby was asked because it's no secret he could use a few
low-post lessons, develop a baby hook, a drop step, anything
resembling a go-to move. The Knicks' 6-foot-11-inch dynamic young
forward has gradually gone from the unknown phenom of the 1999
playoffs to the player who has been included in everyone's game
plan this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talk on the court was, `Make sure you block out Marcus,'''
Camby said the day after he was neutralized by Indiana in Game 1 of
the Eastern Conference finals. ``They know what I did last year
cost them a trip to the finals. They're not going to let me do the
things I did last year.''
</P>
<P>
   A year after skying over Indiana's frontline and changing shots
and his team's travel plans, Camby needs a go-to move.
</P>
<P>
   If the Pacers have truly figured out the Knicks _ and it seems
as if they are off to an impressive start _ Hawaii does not seem
such a faraway place to go find it.

SAVING BITS OF PAST ONLY TO LOSE THEM? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY PAT KOSSAN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - One step ahead of the bulldozers, a small army of
archaeologists is scrambling around Arizona pulling ancient history
out of the ground before it's lost forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pace is actually frightening,'' archaeologist William
Doelle said.
</P>
<P>
   Native American pottery, stone tools, animal bones, fragments of
masks and shell jewelry _ the amount of salvaged treasure has
doubled during the past decade of booming development and is
expected to double again in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the money and the storage space to preserve it has not.
Which means that across the state and the West, priceless artifacts
and the documentation that accompanies them are increasingly in
danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are unique things about our history, our past and Native
Americans' past,'' said George Gumerman, Arizona State Museum
director.
</P>
<P>
   Some items pulled from construction sites are of exhibition
quality. Many more come in bags of pottery shards, pieces of bone
and samples of dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Still, these ``research collections'' draw scientists to Arizona
from around the world _ archaeologists and anthropologists,
geologists and biologists. With sophisticated techniques and
equipment, they study the salvaged bits like a fragile prehistoric
library.
</P>
<P>
   So precious are these artifacts that they are protected in
perpetuity by an expanding web of state and federal laws.
</P>
<P>
   But no one is sure where this expanding collection will be cared
for and stored.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extremely complex problem being discovered all at
once,'' said Stephanie Rodeffer, a Tucson archaeologist for the
National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Gumerman said he could trace the Phoenix area's
early canal system from an airplane by noting the changes in the
contour and color of farm fields.
</P>
<P>
   Today, all that's left are archaeologists' maps of those
waterways and artifacts from the communities they served.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they're gone, they're gone,'' Gumerman said. ``There's
nothing like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts call it a case of rapid-fire growth combined with
ignorance and a lack of money for proper space and storage.
</P>
<P>
   Even public construction projects, most of which are under legal
obligation to save archaeological samples, fail to include the
entire cost of curating and storing what they uncover, Rodeffer
said.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves many of the state's 17 officially permitted
repositories begging for government and foundation grants and
private money just to keep up with their job.
</P>
<P>
   Native American communities are trying to help. But even they
have finite resources that not everyone is eager to use for
storage:
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix's repository, Pueblo Grande Museum, considered a small
but well-documented and climate-controlled repository for nearly
15,000 boxes and cataloged items, is overwhelmed. It needs $2
million to house just the artifacts expected from city projects,
such as the Sky Harbor International Airport expansion and
highways, over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Metal bins are bursting with artifacts, many yet uncataloged,
held by the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, Cultural
Resource Supervisor Ronald Chiago said. Plans for an expanded
museum had to be redrawn when they failed to include space for
storage.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Arizona State Museum, one of the largest in the
Southwest and responsible for certifying other repositories,
decoration is flaking off many of the 20,000 mostly prehistoric
vessels. More than 7,500 of the museum's baskets, many 200 years
old, are stacked one inside another, causing their plant fibers to
crack, wear and change shape.
</P>
<P>
   Gumerman, in charge for two years, is on a fund-raising campaign
and garners statewide praise for doing the best he can under
difficult circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   But the museum, at the University of Arizona, consists of two
buildings more than 60 years old. It cannot afford more space for
proper storage or the equipment to control the damaging
fluctuations in humidity.
</P>
<P>
   Laws requiring recovery and cataloging of artifacts cover many
construction projects _ government projects, construction near
rivers, washes or dams, or those that use public funds, such as
roads and bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Doelle's company, Desert Archaeology, is one of a half-dozen
large companies and dozens of smaller ones operating statewide.
They help construction companies and agencies lawfully excavate
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a decade ago, Doelle's firm bought a 6,700-square-foot
building for storage. Recently, he's had to find an additional
3,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's rapid development puts it on ``the serious end'' of
this problem, Doelle said, and the concern for quality curating and
storage is escalating.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially so because only part of any excavation site,
sometimes less than 10 percent, is typically saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when people follow the law, they destroy the site,'' said
Michael Barton, an Arizona State University archaeologist. ``It's
gone forever.'' &QL;

FREEDOM TO WALK IN THE SUNSHINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY BARBARA YOST  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(GILBERT, Ariz.) - For the first time since he was 5, Collin
Cassinat is walking in sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosed with a genetic disorder that makes him hypersensitive
to the sun, the 11-year-old has lived much of his life in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Windows in his home are tinted and covered with blinds. The
family van is outfitted with blackout curtains. When Collin goes to
school, he dashes from car to classroom covered with a blanket.
</P>
<P>
   He waits until sundown to play outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Collin received the gift of freedom - a pale blue
garment that covers him head to toe and blocks ultraviolet rays.
Cooled by ice packs fitted into the suit, the boy now can venture
outdoors even at high noon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll give him a little more independence, and it will give
him a little more of a normal life,'' said his mother, Cindy
Cassinat. ``He won't have to be on the inside looking out.''
</P>
<P>
   The clothing came from the HED Foundation, a Virginia-based
agency that aids children suffering a variety of disorders,
including sensitivity to sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Collin's condition is called xeroderma pigmentosum. Only about
130 cases of XP are known in the United States, with an estimated
1,000 worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the grandmother of two English boys with a related
disorder challenged the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration to design a protective garment. Using space
technology, NASA made its first suit in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, more than 50 children have received the
UV-protective clothing. The $2,000 cost of each suit is paid
through donations, said HED Foundation president and founder, Sarah
Moody.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, talk show host Rosie O'Donnell orchestrated a
$100,000 contribution from Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   ``The freedom we have given these children you would not
believe,'' Moody said. ``It's given them a quality of life they
would not have had.''
</P>
<P>
   Collin's first adventure outdoors was a romp in his yard. Then
he walked down the street to visit his friend Kevin Dompier. That
felt ``cool,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Greenfield Elementary School, he could join his classmates at
recess instead of playing in the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   There have been longer trips - an outing to Home Depot with his
dad, Tony, and to big brother Christopher's late-afternoon
graduation from Gilbert High School.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing her son gamboling outside during the day - even in
clothes designed to protect him - has left Cindy Cassinat a little
nervous.
</P>
<P>
   The suit's soft fabric, called Sun Weave, seems so flimsy, she
said. Accustomed to covering every inch of her son's body for so
many years, she cinches the hood tight around his eyes underneath
goggles and makes him wear an additional hat.
</P>
<P>
   She has had to put her faith in NASA technology, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit isn't a perfect solution. Putting on the whole outfit -
including pants, jacket, gloves, socks, veil and goggles - takes
about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Collin gets hot despite wearing a bulky cooling vest.
</P>
<P>
   And dressed in a suit that he says makes him look ``bluey,''
Collin attracts attention. At Christopher's graduation, some kids
teased him. Even adults stared.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy remains concerned about the suit's protective powers. She
fears letting Collin lift the veil to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Given the severity of the boy's disorder, her fears are well
founded. Exposure to sunlight for just minutes would cause his skin
to redden, burn and blister. An overdose could kill him.
</P>
<P>
   He has had several operations to remove skin cancers.
</P>
<P>
   But for special occasions, the suit will free Collin from his
daytime confinement. Tony Cassinat wants to plan outdoor family
excursions.
</P>
<P>
   Collin's friends think he looks good and a little ``scary'' in
his suit. They're glad he can play outside now even if it's just a
walk down the street to hunt rocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never got to go out in the day. He could only play at
night,'' said buddy Jare LaRiviere, 9. ``It's pretty cool for
Collin.'' &QL;

 NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CEMETERY MAKES NO BONES ABOUT UNUSUAL GRAVES  &HT;     By KEVIN FAGAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHISKEYTOWN, Calif. _ Louis Orwell must have been one feisty
cowboy, because he sure as heck got the last word.
</P>
<P>
   Orwell was planted backside-up in this historic little Gold Rush
ghost town's cemetery, and this was no grave-digger screwup. His
headstone, a cut-and-welded sheet of iron decorated with carved
cowboy figures, explains:
</P>
<P>
   ``Wanted to be buried face down, so the whole world could kiss
his a_,'' the marker reads, right alongside a picture of a
potbellied Orwell, Stetson hat on his head and a grin on his face.
``June 19, 1931 to Nov. 4, 1991.''
</P>
<P>
   Up the row a piece from him is Indian Mike's headstone, a
motorcycle molded from plastic. On it is the laminated picture of a
muscled, long-haired biker astride his machine, lips set firm
beneath ebony shades. What must have been his favorite beer-can
holder sits alongside _ a full can of suds jammed tight inside, the
top popped open for Indian Mike's ghostly refreshment.
</P>
<P>
   There are graveyards in California filled with headstones of
Hollywood stars, others that run videotape loops of the departed,
even some only for pets. And then there is Whiskeytown Cemetery _
the most wonderfully weird spot in the state in which to bury your
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Set deep in the mountains above Redding and Whiskeytown Lake,
this is where the bones of 19th century pioneers take eternal sleep
beside babies, farmers, bikers, cowboys and other recently departed
inhabitants of the modern world. There are about 800 graves in
colorful profusion in this free-form arena of grief, but it is so
isolated that most people do not even know it exists.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbors know, though. And since 1963, when the pioneers'
graves were dug up and moved from what became the bottom of the
soon-to-be-filled lake, they have known that this is the place
where you can pay a few hundred bucks to Shasta County and bury any
body any way you want.
</P>
<P>
   That means  &UR; any  &LR; way _ there are folks buried in coffee cans,
upside-down on their heads, double-stacked, you name it. The
headstones are hand-done, in shaky handwriting chiseled or painted
onto wood, saw blades, chunks of concrete shaped like animals or
houses, or just about any conglomeration you can imagine.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what we can tell, there is no other cemetery that is
quite like this in all of California, or even sounds like it comes
close,'' marveled Tracey Weatherby of the state Cemetery and
Funeral Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   What strikes you first as you stroll through the entrance gate
in the pole fence is the wacky stuff, like the biker and cowboy.
Over here is a teenage wrestler's headgear, nailed to a stump above
a pile of whiskey and beer bottles, and a motorcycle tank turned
into a headstone; over there is ``Dad's garden,'' a wood-chip patch
sporting a tiny redwood toolshed, complete with miniature rake and
hoe.
</P>
<P>
   Then you look closer. And you see the rest.
</P>
<P>
   You see the tiny graves, the ones with rotting teddy bears and
rattles and baby toys carefully arranged next to tombstones bearing
words so freshly aching you can almost see tears alongside the
letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all these months you've been there, just on the other
side, we tried so hard to touch you, but you were way too shy,''
reads the shakily done inscription on one pink wooden mrker cut
into the shape of a heart. ``... You've gone away to the other
side, but soon we plan to see you there, so honey, please don't
cry.''
</P>
<P>
   The name on the marker is Alyssa Marie McCollum. There is just
one date, June 23, 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Lilialani, 1 month old when she died on Jan. 17, 1995,
lies beneath a white plastic plate set in cement. Set meticulously
atop her 3-by-4-foot grave is a display of the things that must
have filled her little world: dolls and teddy bears, a red-and-blue
jump rope, three key-shaped rattles, a plastic Christmas picture of
the three kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our beloved daughter is in God's hands now,'' the plate reads.
</P>
<P>
   Other kids rest in elaborate wooden shrines with benches,
photos, shelves holding their favorite toys or excerpts from the
poem, ``Footprints,'' the greeting card staple about God carrying a
beloved one through hard times.
</P>
<P>
   Most often, it is the children who had to memorialize their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sue'' chose to send her 77-year-old father, Page Lermill, into
the beyond with a headstone fashioned from a sawmill blade and an
accompanying poem laminated on wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for being there, unconditional love ... Sunday walks
for ice cream and comic books ... the truth about the ``Man in the
Moon'' and ``Falling Rock'' ... for loving my mother and telling me
often,'' she wrote. The grave is rimmed with 4-by-4 boards, and
figurines of deer and squirrels guard the saw blade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, you could say it's ... different,'' allowed Bob Schwan,
a Shasta County coroner's deputy who helps oversee the graveyard.
``As long as it's not offensive, we let anyone do whatever they
want. It lets them work out their sorrow creatively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Works out real good for everyone involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwan said that when the county moved the original Whiskeytown
Cemetery out of the reservoir bed, the new site was intended only
for indigents. And for years, it did serve only the poor, ``but
eventually it got too popular, so we opened it up to anyone,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have millionaires, homeless people, normal folks, kids, all
sorts there now. Everyone's welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are a county resident, the cost is $500 per plot.
Nonresidents add a $150 surcharge.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the attraction is being laid to rest in true nature,
with nothing to crowd the mountainous view but pines, blue skies
and the occasional bald eagle. And there is the comfort of knowing,
too, that you share space with genuine pioneers whose only other
visible legacies are a few scattered, ghostly houses on the other
side of the lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you'll find any spot on earth this pretty, this
wild, for a graveyard,'' Schwan said.
</P>
<P>
   That is what drew George Mills, 62, to the cemetery in October
when it came time to bury his 84-year-old wife, Lorraine. And
recently he was back, spray-painting the iron-grate fence he built
around her grave and tidying up the flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came to the lake for vacation in 1976, fell in love with it
and came back every summer after that,'' said Miller, brushing a
finger tenderly across the words, ``Mrs. Whiskeytown,'' painted on
a green sign on the fence. ``She's happy here, I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills lived in South San Francisco until he and Lorraine moved
to nearby Shingletown a month before she died. He is never leaving,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I die, they're going to cremate me and just put me in
that same hole with Lorraine,'' Mills said. In the meantime, he
plans to make a marble headstone with words he can read as he sits
on the little steel-pipe-and-cedar bench he built in front of
Lorraine's fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I'll say on the stone,'' Mills said, a faraway
look creeping into his eyes: ``God looked down on the Earth one day
and saw Lorraine's beautiful face...'' He stopped, scuffed a toe at
the mounded dirt and began to cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard,'' Mills said quietly when he found his voice again.
``If it wasn't for this place, this beautiful little place where I
could lay her down just the way I wanted...'' He stopped short
again, but this time brightened after a few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God for small favors like Whiskeytown,'' Mills said,
peering into the pine trees overhead with a smile. ``Thank God.''

MENDOZA AND YANKS END TRIP ON UP NOTE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan., Ohio)  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The New York Yankees' world spins faster than any
other in baseball, from brilliance to darkness to brilliance. After
experiencing moments of ignominy on this road trip, they will
return in full gleam to Yankee Stadium on Friday, to play the
Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees thrashed the previously undefeated Chicago pitcher
James Baldwin and the White Sox Thursday night, 7-0, and moved into
a first-place tie with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Mendoza, under the inspection of scouts sent here
specifically to see him, needed only 100 pitches to throw the
Yankees' second shutout of the season, and Ricky Ledee _ who will
lose his spot in the lineup if the Yankees make a trade _ drove in
three runs.
</P>
<P>
   From darkness to brilliance: The Yankees won the final two games
of the road trip and improved their record to 26-17. They are on a
pace to win 98 games. And Derek Jeter, the shortstop who is on the
15-day disabled list, is expected to play two minor league games
and be activated in time for Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch fielded a grounder and flipped to first for the
final out of the game, and catcher Jorge Posada tapped Mendoza on
the back of the neck. It was easy to forget that in the seventh
inning Wednesday, it looked as if the Yankees would lose their
fourth consecutive game and fall two games behind the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last three innings Wednesday and the first three
innings Thursday, the Yankees' offense erupted _ 18 runs and 21
hits over those six innings _ for back-to-back victories to finish
the road trip.

<P>
   Baldwin had been 7-0 and had a chance to become the first
American League pitcher to accumulate eight victories. Quite
simply, this was just one of those nights when Baldwin's stuff was
lacking, when his command was poor. He kept falling behind in the
count.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee doubled home a run in the second. Scott Brosius came to
the plate, feeling better about his swing. In an attempt to prevent
his front side from flying open in his swing, Brosius had all but
eliminated his stride forward, and had a couple of hits Wednesday.
Facing Baldwin Thursday night in the second, Brosius took a pitch
out of the strike zone and blasted a high changeup for a two-run
homer. Yankees 3, Chicago 0.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Spencer singled with the bases loaded in the third inning
and Paul O'Neill ran home, before Ledee rolled a two-run single to
give Mendoza a six-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts from the Cincinnati Reds and the Kansas City Royals came
to watch Mendoza. The Yankees have been asking around for
left-handed hitters, like the Reds' Dmitri Young and Michael Tucker
and the Royals' Johnny Damon. There was no telling what the scouts
would see in Mendoza. The right-hander, after all, had not started
a game in 18 days, and his control sometimes suffers _ his sinker
ball sailing high _ when he has too much rest. He struggled with
this in the early innings.
</P>
<P>
   But Mendoza, emboldened by the Yankees' early lead, managed to
throw strikes, lots and lots of strikes, getting ahead in the
count.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to pitch,'' Mendoza said through a translator. ``They
gave me the ball to pitch, and thankfully, I did well.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre said: ``He really didn't get in any trouble.
He really didn't stress at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza, who allowed only four hits and a walk, is 5-2 and has
more victories than any other Yankee starter.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ There seems to be so much anger in the air these
days.
</P>
<P>
   I vaguely sensed hostility directed my way this morning as I was
driving to work on the sidewalk in my Ford Exploitation stretch
SUV, chatting on my cell phone, smoking a cigarette, drinking a
beer, cleaning my handgun, blaring a new gangsta-rap CD and lookin'
good in my sweatshop-made, baby-sealskin Dodger jacket.

any work on the stairs.

   Man, it's a bad day when the stairs break down.
</P>
<P>
   People were climbing over the sawhorses _ it looked like a

<P>
   The sight reminded me of that old TV commercial where O.J.

MATVICHUK SUFFERS CONCUSSION; LEAGUE TO REVIEW HIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER_ Colorado forward Dave Andreychuk's elbow to Richard
Matvichuk's head in the first period Thursday night sent Matvichuk
out of the game with a mild concussion and a red flag to the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been asked to take a look at it,'' NHL commissioner Gary
Bettman said. ``So since we're taking a look at it. It wouldn't be
appropriate to comment.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHL may not be talking, but the Stars were after their 2-1
loss to Colorado at the Pepsi Center in Denver, tying the Western
Conference Finals at three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it was an elbow in the head pretty simple,'' Stars coach
Ken Hitchcock said. ``Rules should be simple. If Matty is out, so
should (Andreychuck).''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate effects of Matvichuk's absence meant some more
lineup shuffling and extended minutes for Derian Hatcher, Dave
Manson and others. The extended effects, if Matvichuk does not
return, potentially could be devastating to one of the best
defensive tandems in the league and more controversy for the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Andreychuk hit (Matvichuk's) jaw, and I think his head
hit the glass,'' Hatcher said. ``Am I surprised? No. Andreychuk, if
you look through the series, has done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the season, the NHL has tried to come down on such
hits and has usually handed down suspensions accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The) coaching staff had meetings with the supervisors and the
referees and they talked about there is a time limit on hitting
guys once they make a pass,'' Stars center Guy Carbonneau said. ``I
don't know, but I think the puck was at the blue line when
(Matvichuk) got hit and (Andreychuk) was coming from the red line.
So, I think he had one intention and one intention only and that
was to hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, naturally, didn't see it quite that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the bench, it seemed like a very fair hit,'' Avs coach
Bob Hartley said. ``This is the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also on to Game 7 where the Stars could be playing without
their most active defenseman in the series. Matvichuk has one goal
and three assists, including the assist on Joe Nieuwendyk's
overtime goal in Game 5. He also has 17 hits and 14 blocks.
</P>
<P>
   With him out, fewer players log more ice time. If he does not
return for Game 7 on Saturday, Hitchcock said that either Jamie
Pushor or Brad Lukowich could dress in Matvichuk's place.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Hatcher and Sergei Zubov saw more than 30
minutes of ice time. Stars assistant coach Rick Wilson still called
it their best defensive game in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had a pretty big effect,'' Hitchcock said. ``Matty plays
the second-most minutes on the team. But I thought we played a
great game and this is typical of our team.''
</P>
<P>
   If Matvichuk does return, he will embody a slogan written on the
Stars locker room board: ``The body will go anywhere the mind takes
it.''

 RESEARCHERS SAY DAVIS PLAN FOR SCHOOLS WON'T WORK  &HT;     By NANETTE ASIMOV 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A scathing critique of the state's strategy for improving
schools _ the strategy Gov. Gray Davis hopes will ``restore the
greatness of California education'' _ says the plan resembles a
broken jigsaw puzzle and is unlikely to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The damning conclusions are found in a thick report to be
released Friday by researchers from the University of California at
Berkeley and Stanford University who formed a group 17 years ago
called PACE: Policy Analysis for California Education.
</P>
<P>
   The report, written by respected academics, is the most
comprehensive criticism to date of California's multiyear attempt
to turn student achievement around. It reinforces earlier warnings
that state politicians in the 1990s acted hastily and did not
create a cohesive, thoughtful plan to reform public education in
California.
</P>
<P>
   The reforms were prompted by the embarrassment and long-term
consequences of California children posting some of the worst test
scores in the nation. The initial legislation, enacted under former
Gov. Pete Wilson, was meant to be a clear formula for success:
</P>
<P>
   Create strong academic standards, then give teachers the books
and training to teach to those standards, and, finally, test
students on their progress and hold schools accountable for the
results.
</P>
<P>
   But the new critique says the plan's creators never coherently
linked the pieces. As a result, most teachers do not teach to the
standards, and a mishmash of different exams does not reflect them,
the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, the state's system fails to provide a long-term
solution for the growing shortage of qualified teachers. It ignores
children of preschool age and appears to forget that colleges and
universities are the final link in the chain, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   School reform programs by the state resemble ``pieces of a
jigsaw puzzle just dumped from the box,'' the researchers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes at a time when state lawmakers are considering
new educational programs even as existing programs have yet to
trickle down to the classroom, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to stop the mad scramble to add more programs when we
don't know what is working,'' said co-author Elizabeth Burr of UC
Berkeley. ``You don't hear much talk about building in an
evaluation plan for these new ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-author Mike Kirst, an education professor at Stanford and a
former president of the state Board of Education, predicted that
California students will become so fed up with the many disparate
exams they are expected to take _ many of which have little
connection to classroom instruction or college admissions _ that
they will refuse to take them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assessment system may just break down from a lack of
student participation,'' Kirst said. His report recommends a
simplified testing system.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were immediately rebuted by Ann Bancroft,
spokeswoman for Davis' education secretary, Sue Burr (no relation
to researcher Elizabeth Burr), and John Mockler, executive director
of the California Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Both said the report does not consider that Davis has just
recommended a $1.8 billion infusion of school money not earmarked
for specific programs, the largest one-time educational funding
boost in state history.
</P>
<P>
   To hear state officials tell it, California is in the middle of
its first intelligent school improvement strategy in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Davis became governor last year vowing to continue the program
and this year has presided over the start of a school rating system
that promises rewards for schools that improve and threatens state
intervention for those that do not.
</P>
<P>
   Mockler also defended the governor's attempts to attract and
retain qualified teachers. He said Davis has proposed an array of
bonuses and other incentives _ ``even home loans, for God's sake''
_ to entice skilled teachers to work in low-performing schools
where their efforts can do the most good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plans are interesting,'' Mockler said. ``But in the end, it's
the laws we make that distribute the funds. And if you track that,
you'll see an extremely focused agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirst said the state should not junk its reforms but do four
things to knit them together:
</P>
<P>
   -- Provide a timetable for tying academic testing to standards
and training teachers to teach to those standards.
</P>
<P>
   -- Create a plan that gets students _ from preschool to
university _ ready for the next level.
</P>
<P>
   -- Clarify the instructional system for about 25 percent of the
state's 6 million students who need special help in learning
English.
</P>
<P>
   -- Overhaul the education financing system so that local school
districts can have far more say over how they use state money.
</P>
<P>
   State Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin said
that while the idea of greater spending flexibility is appealing,
money for specific programs is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of those programs came about because there was a
class of students who weren't being served,'' she said, citing
programs for special education and gifted students as examples.
``Those programs each have a constituency. You just try to take
them away. Those are some of the most aggressive parents in
America. People in academic institutions sometimes forget that we
have a political process and that there is a reason why these
programs get established.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirst finds it encouraging that state testing officials are
working to make the test reflect the standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's got potential,'' he said. ``We'd like to hear more
about that.''

OPPORTUNITY KNOCKED, STARS DIDN'T ANSWER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The score was tied. The clock was ticking. Bodies kept
tangling and scuffling in the corners.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had the Colorado Avalanche right where they wanted
them.
</P>
<P>
   Been there. Seen that. One unforgettable night, almost 12 months
ago _ it seems like 12 years _ they won a Stanley Cup on such a
smothering, shoulder-to-shoulder night.
</P>
<P>
   But this time the Stars didn't.
</P>
<P>
   This time opportunity knocked _ and the clatter only served to
wake up Colorado's Ray Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there will be a Game 7 in this series that deserves a
dramatic final chapter. On a Chris Drury deflection off a Bourque
slap shot that was headed wide, with less than four minutes
remaining to play, the Avalanche prevailed, 2-1, at the Pepsi
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Hey. That's the Stars' old script.
</P>
<P>
   A golden opportunity lost?
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock didn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost a hockey game,'' Hitchcock said. ``On the road, I
guess, you're going to have to score more than one goal to win. But
we had chances, quality chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's the game of hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock chose to look at the broader picture. His team had
come into a noisy, partisan arena, and played a talented, desperate
team off its feet for more than 56 minutes. It nearly pulled it
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing our way,'' the coach said. ``We're playing a
gritty, in-your-face hockey game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we won a couple where they played well and were just
unfortunate, and now they've won a couple where we were
unfortunate. So I think this series is exactly where it should
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but since when do the scales of justice have anything to
do with this?
</P>
<P>
   Opportunity knocked with a golden invitation Thursday night. And
the Stars couldn't answer.
</P>
<P>
   For once in this series, the shot numbers were going the
defending champs' way. The battle had been joined, as Hitch likes
to say. The Stars were winning faceoffs. Brett Hull, to use another
Hitchism, had ``taken a huge bite of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   On nights like this, you have to win. Hockey's semi-nightly
playoff drama doesn't guarantee another golden chance.
</P>
<P>
   For one, there is this thing called momentum. In the NHL
postseason, the concept well may not exist. But an absence of
momentum can be conspicuous, as the Avalanche displayed just
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in front of a boisterous, expectant home crowd, the Avs
appeared to come out anxious and uncertain. The only elixir that
seemed to unloosen them came when Dave Andreychuk slammed the
Stars' Richard Matvichuk into the glass with a right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that's hockey. But it went unpenalized, even as Matvichuk
lay face-up on the ice, motionless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good,'' Hitchcock reported later. ``It was an elbow
to the head. So it's simple, right? If Matty is out, so should `38'
(Andreychuk's number).''
</P>
<P>
   The blow lingered in more ways than the ringing in Matvichuk's
head. Colorado coach Bob Hartley took advantage of the shuffling
and longer-shifting that Hitchcock was forced to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It left a big hole at their blue line,'' Hartley said.
</P>
<P>
   The loss became doubly damaging when the Rip Van Winklesque
Bourque suddenly stirred. Acquired from Boston just to deliver
moments like this, Bourque had been wounded, silent and scoreless
before this night.
</P>
<P>
   But he put the Avs on the board first when he was left to walk
down the slot in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a great performance,'' Hartley said. ``Tonight he carried
this team.''
</P>
<P>
   He carried them, as it turned out, back to Dallas, where an
anxious Game Seven awaits.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars should have never let it come to that.

 HOUSE VOTES TO DUMP 102-YEAR-OLD PHONE `LUXURY' TAX  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House overwhelmingly approved the repeal
Thursday of a telephone tax originally imposed in 1898 to finance
the Spanish-American War.
</P>
<P>
   Repeal of the 3 percent excise tax, which passed 420 to 2, was
high on House Republicans' ``eContract 2000'' agenda, which is
designed to burnish the GOP's high-tech credentials. It follows a
five-year extension of the Internet tax moratorium that Republicans
pushed through the House two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Repeal proved immensely popular with Democrats as well,
attracting Rep. Bob Matsui, D-Calif., as a lead co-sponsor. The
bill goes next to the Senate, where it is sponsored by John Breaux,
D-La., and William Roth, R-Del. The Clinton administration contends
that a repeal would be costly, but has not threatened a veto.
</P>
<P>
   The tax, which costs the average telephone user about $24 a
year, was an irresistible target for House lawmakers. Its age and
origin invited ridicule, and its structure _ a flat charge on
telephone use _ was widely assailed as hitting the poor hardest and
contributing to the ``digital divide'' that inhibits poor people's
access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when our nation must find ways to make the
information revolution affordable to all Americans, repealing this
regressive tax should be one of our first steps,'' said Rep. Anna
Eshoo, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The century-old tax originally was conceived as a temporary
``luxury tax'' on a novel product, the telephone, which only the
very wealthy could afford in 1898.
</P>
<P>
   In 1898, only 1,376 Americans had phones. The tax now applies to
252 million telephone lines that carry everything from computer
communications and faxes to cellular phone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish-American War lasted less than eight months, but the
tax has survived 102 years, generating more and more revenue as
telephone use has grown.
</P>
<P>
   The tax was repealed in 1916, then reinstated a year later to
help finance World War I. It was killed again in 1924, then renewed
during the Depression in 1932. It was scheduled to be phased out
several times, but was ultimately raised to 3 percent in 1985 and
made permanent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chris Cox, R-Calif., a member of the GOP leadership who
seized on the tax as a ripe target for repeal, called it
``unnecessary and unfair confiscation'' Thursday and urged members
``to run a bayonet through it and kill it.''
</P>
<P>
   The repeal would be phased in to take full effect in 2002. The
federal government would stand to lose roughly $20 billion over
five years. That makes for a substantial tax cut that would be
assailed on Capitol Hill as fiscally irresponsible in most other
circumstances, but it drew almost no opposition Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Only California Democratic Rep. Pete Stark and Rep. John Murtha,
D-Pa., voted against repeal.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since President Clinton vetoed a $792 billion, 10-year tax
cut that Republicans passed last year, House GOP leaders have been
repackaging its most popular elements as separate bills that are
more difficult for Democrats to oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most high-tech legislation, repealing the telephone tax
drew scant interest from Silicon Valley. Many lobbyists had not
even heard of the idea when it began surfacing a few months ago.
Nor did telephone companies push for repeal, since they simply pass
the tax through to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The federal telephone tax is only a small part of total excise
taxes on telephone use, most of which are levied by state and local
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Combined federal, state and local telephone excise taxes reach
as high as one-third of telephone bills in some states.
</P>
<P>
   Repeal of the tax was one of the few items that an Advisory
Commission on Electronic Commerce, set up to make recommendations
on Internet taxes, could agree on after a year and a half of
deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said the phone tax has become increasingly difficult
to apply fairly to communications devices other than telephones.
</P>
<P>
   The only controversy over the bill arose over a side-dispute on
campaign finance reform, when several Democrats tried to attach a
measure to force nonprofit political organizations to reveal their
contributors. Because they are non profits, such groups, which are
increasingly used to funnel millions of dollars in campaign
contributions to run ``issue ads'' in political races, are exempt
from the telephone tax. The measure narrowly failed.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans favoring repeal staged a Capitol Hill news
conference replete with a costumed cast dressed as Theodore
Roosevelt and his ``Rough Riders'' _ famous figures from the
Spanish-American War.
</P>
<P>
   Matsui said he was happy to work with Republicans on the
telephone tax repeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have things we can work together on, it's important
that we do,'' Matsui said. ``This, to me, is a good issue for the
public, and it's certainly an issue for the Democratic Party,'' he
said, because the tax is so regressive.

MARINERS' ABBOTT SURVIVES BROKEN BAT IN FACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The pitcher's worst nightmare isn't blowing a save
or giving up a grand slam or even walking in the winning run in the
bottom of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   No, the worst nightmare is much more personal, and it visited
the Mariners Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Abbott, scrambling to glove a grounder hit by the Orioles'
Harold Baines, was hit on the right side of the head by a hefty
fragment of Baines' broken bat in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   It could have cost Abbott an eye, but he caught a break. The bat
hit him flush rather than hitting him with either of the pointed
ends. He suffered cuts requiring eight stitches and a slightly
broken nose, but he was breathing and seeing effortlessly after the
Mariners' 5-1 loss to Baltimore. And that was enough to take a
little of the sting out of the game, in which the Orioles completed
a three-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott didn't want to go on TV afterward, but he was otherwise
cheerful, joking and laughing after having dodged a major bullet.
He had both X-rays and a CAT scan, and no major damage was seen,
although the right side of his head sustained considerable
swelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel lucky, very lucky,'' Abbott said. ``I have to be,
because all I ever saw was the ball. I never saw the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Rick Griffin came sprinting out of the Seattle dugout as
Abbott slumped to the ground, swollen and bleeding. He was joined
on the field by every member of the Mariners, plus manager Lou
Piniella, pitching coach Bryan Price and the next scheduled batter,
Baltimore's Cal Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to be there in less 10 seconds, and the swelling already
was considerable,'' Griffin said. ``That was extremely fast
swelling. But he never lost consciousness, and he kept talking,
which was good.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in pain and blood loss, Abbott never lost his sense of
humor. With the entire Mariners lineup gathered around him, he
broke up his audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Jay Buhner that after this, Harold Baines better at
least give me an autographed bat,'' Abbott said, grinning slightly
at the recollection.
</P>
<P>
   As Abbott made his way from the trainer's room to his locker at
the far wall in the visitor's clubhouse in Camden Yards, he made
slow progress. It wasn't because he couldn't walk, it was because
many of his teammates and coaches came up to him to shake his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella was the most emphatic, shaking Abbott's hand, then
giving him a big-league bear hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really glad to see you're OK, son,'' Piniella said. ``I
was really, really worried about you.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too soon to make a judgment about Abbott's next appearance
on the mound. The medical advice that Griffin shared with Abbott
was that after two days off, the pitcher could resume throwing.
Theoretically, that means Abbott could face the White Sox in
Seattle next week, but the Mariners will play it cool.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Mariners were able to think about how lucky one
of their own had been, a fact that overshadowed a third consecutive
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll guarantee you that every pitcher's heart started pounding
to see that,'' fellow pitcher Brett Tomko said.
</P>
<P>
   All pitchers on both sides of the field have been there. The
winning pitcher Thursday, Mike Mussina, almost lost an eye on May
14, 1998, when he took a line drive from Cleveland's Sandy Alomar
just above his right eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen that happen before in real life,'' Mariners
pitcher Jamie Moyer said. ``But I've woken up in the middle of the
night having a nightmare about it. There's no worse nightmare for a
pitcher, really. If a line drive comes back at you, you can see
that. But when the ball and the bat are both coming at you, and the
bat's broken, that's trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Mussina knows about that. We all do.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Dan Wilson, one of the first to the scene, was also one
of the first to see that Abbott was still conscious and talking.
Wilson had been fearing the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he takes the point of that bat instead of having it hit him
the way it did, it would have been a disaster,'' Wilson said. ``Or
more of a disaster than it turned out to be. I'm just glad he's
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   On another night, the word ``disaster'' might be thrown loosely
to describe the Seattle offense. The Mariners got just one run
Thursday and just six runs in three games. But such word usage in
the wake of what happened to Abbott would be at the best trivial
and at the worst demeaning.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners didn't hit Thursday and fell from first place to
third place in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   So what? As Scarlet O'Hara reminds us, ``Tomorrow is another
day.''
</P>
<P>
   One that Paul Abbott will be lucky enough to see with both eyes.

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
INDIANAPOLIS _ For a while, the Indiana Pacers were beginning to
think the summer rerun season had arrived.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After working so hard to get the home-court advantage in the
Eastern Conference finals against the New York Knicks, the Pacers
were on the verge of blowing that edge for the second straight
year.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pacers rallied in the final minutes to pull out a tense
88-84 victory Thursday night in Game 2 of the conference finals.
The win, which came before a sellout crowd of 18,345 at Conseco
Fieldhouse, gives the Pacers a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven
series, which resumes Saturday at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Knicks were very well-prepared for this game,'' said
Reggie Miller, who finished with 19 points, including a pair of key
free throws with 28 seconds left in the game that put the Pacers up
by two points. ``They wanted a game in the 80s, and they got it.
But we can't rest on this. It's better going there (to New York) up
2-0 than 1-1.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what happened last season when the Pacers, just like
this year, had worked all season to gain the home-court advantage,
only to blow it right off the bat in the conference finals by
allowing the Knicks to walk off with a split in the first two
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers scored the final six points Thursday, with Dale Davis
capping his second 16-rebound game of the series by grabbing his
own missed free throw and dishing the ball to Jalen Rose for a
game-clinching dunk with 2.4 seconds left, the last of his
team-high 24 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the biggest game in Pacers franchise history,'' said
Rose, who played the entire 48 minutes despite getting a tooth
knocked out by a stray elbow. ``We were just trying to do what we
need to do to get to the next round. But then Patrick Ewing went
out of the game, and I was thinking, `Oh, no. Here we go again.'
When he's out, they (the Knicks) have a different look.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for the Knicks, Thursday's game looked exactly like last
year's Game 2 because Ewing was again lost to an injury. Last
season it was a torn Achilles' tendon that knocked Ewing out of
action, an injury that sidelined him for the rest of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was a strained peroneal tendon in his right foot,
knocking him out of the game after playing just seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know what happened,'' Ewing said of his injury.
``I made a play to go to the basket, and I just felt something
pull. It happened right when I took myself out of the game (with
5:29 left in the first period).
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now they (team doctors) are basically saying it's a
sprain. It's ironic that I got injured in Game 2 of last year's
series and then Game 2 of this year's, too. But hopefully I won't
have to miss the rest of the series. I'm going to go back and get
an MRI (today), and hopefully I'll be able to play on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks will need his offense.
</P>
<P>
   Already in a state of rigor score-tis after going seven games
with Miami in the conference semifinals, the Knicks were further
handicapped by Ewing's injury. So Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy
decided to reduce the game to the basketball equivalent of a
pitchers' duel, slowing the pace to a crawl and hoping to somehow
pull out a win.
</P>
<P>
   The way the Knicks usually play.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Pacers are more known for their offense, Miller
said things are going to have to be different for Indiana against
the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense is going to win this series,'' he said. ``Everybody's
been talking about our 3-point shots and the way we move the
basketball, but that's not what's going to win this series. Defense
is going to win this series. I think that's what got us back
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   That and the fact center Rik Smits finally showed up for the
game. Smits, who missed six of his seven shots through three
periods, scored 10 of his 12 points in the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Smits got them to the doorstep, but Miller and Rose made the
final push for the Pacers. Rose hit a 17-foot jumper with 55.5
seconds left in the game to tie it at 84, and after a miss by New
York's Allan Houston, Miller hit a pair of free throws with 28
seconds remaining after being run over by Houston and Larry Johnson
as he set up on the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks got the ball to Latrell Sprewell (10 points, 3-of-14
shooting) for one last shot, but his fadeaway jumper skipped off
the rim. Davis seized the rebound and was immediately fouled.
</P>
<P>
   Davis missed the first free throw, but the Knicks set up for the
second with two guards _ Sprewell and Houston _ on the blocks for
the rebound. When the 6-11 Davis missed the second, he swooped in
for the rebound and quickly passed to Rose to clinch the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that if I did miss,'' Davis said, ``I would have a
real good chance of getting the rebound over the small people
because I could jump over them.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss was crushing for the Knicks, who got superb
performances from Johnson (25 points), Kurt Thomas (10 points,
eight rebounds) and Chris Childs (12 points).
</P>
<P>
   But not as crushing as a loss would have been for the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked hard to get this home-court advantage, and we need
to take advantage of it,'' said Indiana coach Larry Bird. ``I can't
say it enough. New York outplayed us tonight. We got lucky.''

MODANO OK DESPITE TRICKY FOOTE WORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD, CHAREAN WILLIAMS AND MAC ENGEL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Dallas Stars, who already had lost defenseman
Richard Matvichuk to a concussion in the first period, survived a
big scare in the second period Thursday night when center Mike
Modano injured his left knee at 11:50.
</P>
<P>
   Avalanche defenseman Adam Foote used the slew foot on Modano.
While high-sticking Modano, Foote cut Modano's legs out from
underneath him. Foote received a two-minute penalty for
high-sticking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's tried to (do that) all series,'' Modano said. ``I
don't think it's a real mystery what those guys are trying to do.
It's just something at this time of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kind of locked knees, and the stick caught me in the
chin. It wasn't anything major _ a couple of bruises. I felt fine
once I got up and got moving a little bit. He leads with his stick
and his hands a lot. He just caught me good there.''
</P>
<P>
   While Modano was in the locker room, the Stars scored a goal on
a five-on-three power play at 12:37. Modano returned to the ice at
16:01.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as we want to do something about it, you have to use
your head,'' Stars center Guy Carbonneau said. ``I think we did (do
something about it). We scored a goal.'' SPRAIN FOR LANGENBRUNNER
</P>
<P>
   An MRI exam of Stars winger Jamie Langenbrunner's right knee
revealed only a sprain, Ken Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner was injured when he tangled with Avalanche
defenseman Aaron Miller in the first period of Game 5.
Langenbrunner has not skated since but will be re-evaluated Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said after the game he doubted Langenbrunner could
play in Game 7. ``If we had a couple more days maybe, but right now
he is still limping and until he can become really pain-free, I
don't think there is any way we can play him,'' Hitchcock said.
CARBONNEAU STILL TOUGH
</P>
<P>
   Guy Carbonneau has earned a reputation as one of the NHL's
toughest defensive centers, even at 40.
</P>
<P>
   He showed it again early Thursday night when he got into an
extended tangle with Colorado forward Peter Forsberg.
</P>
<P>
   Near the blue line, the two went down when Carbonneau proceeded
to push, grapple and shove with the Avs forward. A little later,
Carbonneau was checked into the boards, where Forberg skated by and
gave him a soft kick to his head. FERNANDEZ'S FUTURE ELSEWHERE
</P>
<P>
   Stars backup goalie Manny Fernandez hasn't played a game in
almost two months. So he finds it odd that anybody is talking to
him, much less about him to him.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody wants to know where he thinks he'll be playing next
season.
</P>
<P>
   While the topic sounds harsh, it isn't anything anybody didn't
know.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the playoffs, Fernandez likely won't be a Stars
player anymore. He'll either be exposed in the expansion draft or
traded before it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be one of those summers I think,'' Fernandez
said. ``What makes it worse is (goalie) Roman (Turek) got traded to
a pretty good team (St. Louis), and I think (Stars general manager
Bob Gainey) might be worried about doing the same thing again.''
</P>
<P>
   The writing has been on the wall since the Stars signed goalie
Ed Belfour to a three-year contract on opening night. This season
has basically been an audition for Fernandez, who finished the
season with an 11-8-3 record, a 2.13 goals-against average and a
.920 save percentage backing up Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of stuff to prove to myself this year, and I'm
happy with my season,'' said Fernandez, who said he didn't really
know if he's ready to be a No. 1. ``Maybe, I am. We'll find out if
I get the call. ... I think it's pretty boastful to go out and say
`Yeah, I am. I'm not that Roman type. Roman for a year used to say
`Well, I want to play. I want to play. I want to be traded. I want
to be No. 1.' I'm not like that.'' SLOAN GETS THE CALL
</P>
<P>
   With Jamie Langenbrunner out with a sprained right knee, Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock had to decide whether to replace him with Blake
Sloan, who had played in the series but been benched for Games 4
and 5, or Jon Sim, who had yet to play a minute in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock decided to go with Sloan.
</P>
<P>
   And while Sloan didn't petition, he really wanted to get in.
Game 3 left a bad taste in his mouth. He played only 3 minutes, 36
seconds all game and almost none at all in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want that to be your last game,'' Sloan said. ``You
want to go out, play well and help the team.'' ABOUT TIME
</P>
<P>
   Stars center Mike Modano did not have a shot on goal in Games 3,
4 or 5. The three-game shotless streak was a personal record for
him.
</P>
<P>
   He got his first shot in four games at 9:35 of the first period
of Game 6. The Stars were short-handed when goalie Patrick Roy
turned over the puck to Modano. BETTER THAN '99
</P>
<P>
   Avs winger Dave Reid has now seen Stars goalie Ed Belfour from
two perspectives, last season as an teammate and this season as an
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   So is Belfour playing better this season?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Reid said. ``I think he played great last
year. I think he was the main reason the Stars won the Cup last
year. I don't know what his stats are in comparison, but they have
to be close.''
</P>
<P>
   Not close. Better.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour had a 2.05 goals-against average against Colorado in the
Western Conference Finals last season. He had a 1.75 goals against
average through five games this season. THE BEST
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull has proven to be the Avalanche killer this series. He
entered Thursday night's game with three multipoint contests in his
past four games.
</P>
<P>
   In the first five games, Hull scored four of the Stars' 10
goals. He scored the Stars' only goal Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to do, other than keep him out of the slot
and don't let him shoot the puck,'' Aaron Miller said before Game
6. ``I mean, the guy can score goals. He's done it his whole
career. He's definitely doing it right now.'' nn

FORMER COLORADO GOVERNOR AMONG CONTENDERS FOR TOP L.A. SCHOOLS
POST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID R. BAKER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The search for the next superintendent of Los
Angeles schools has narrowed to three candidates, including former
Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, board President Genethia Hayes said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Unified School District board members interviewed
Romer on Thursday and hope to meet the remaining two as soon as
possible, perhaps by Tuesday, she said. Members declined to name
those two candidates, although sources close to the search said one
is an educator while the other comes from outside the field.
</P>
<P>
   The three finalists have been whittled from a list of 11
candidates whose names were forwarded to the board by the search
committee, Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas many candidates already have withdrawn their names from
consideration, all three people left in the running told the search
committee that they want the job, Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not us trying to beg someone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, board members said that if they can't agree on
a choice from among those three, they may try yet again to convince
interim Superintendent Ramon Cortines to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Cortines, however, has repeatedly said he plans to leave the
district at the end of his term, which expires June 30. Although
some on the board hope they could appeal to his sense of
responsibility to the district and its students, they acknowledge
convincing him would be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to play upon his sense of civic duty when he's
already done so much,'' said board member Caprice Young. ``Really,
the most important thing for us to do now is look forward, and that
means finding a new superintendent.''
</P>
<P>
   Cortines said he didn't think the board would need him to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board is in a serious process, and they will find a
superintendent,'' he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one predicted an easy search, the hunt for Cortines'
replacement has been difficult. Many of the 11 candidates brought
to the board by the search committee already have bowed out. And
with Sacramento legislators threatening to appoint a watchdog to
oversee the district's operations, many Los Angeles Unified
officials worry that no one of the caliber needed for the job would
want to take it on.
</P>
<P>
   The post, which could pay more than $200,000 a year, includes
the oversight of 67,000 employees and 711,000 students in
kindergarten through 12th grade.

GREEN'S BIG CATCH, BUNT CRITICAL IN RANGERS' WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Rangers went trolling for an outfielder a
few weeks ago and wanted to land either Ron Gant or Todd
Hollandsworth.
</P>
<P>
   They settled for Scarborough Green, a minor-leaguer from their
own system who has never hit enough to merit serious big-league
time. But for one night at least he was just what they needed: an
outfielder with terrific speed and a great glove.
</P>
<P>
   His spectacular catch saved starter Esteban Loaiza from disaster
in the sixth inning and his bunt single started a three-run seventh
that carried the Rangers to a 5-3 victory against the Kansas City
Royals on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Green was a last-minute replacement in center field for Ruben
Mateo, who was scratched from the lineup after suffering a slightly
strained ribcage muscle in his right side. Green's play proved
decisive even on a night when Rafael Palmeiro homered in the second
and delivered the two-run single in the seventh that put the
Rangers ahead for good.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Ivan Rodriguez also went 3-for-5, putting him atop the
American League batting leaders with a .381 average, and John
Wetteland recorded his 10th save in May, tying the club record for
most saves in a month. But this night belonged to Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``The star of the game,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any success is gratifying, but that's kind of my role,'' Green
said. ``Not playing every day, I have to get my work in, get
focused and keep my body in good shape so I can pitch in when I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   He did so in the sixth with the catch, a play that was set up by
singles by Mark Quinn and Carlos Beltran, putting runners at first
and third with one out and the score 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Johnson then crushed a line drive to deep center that sent
Green racing back to the warning track. He was turned to his right
as the ball sailed over his left shoulder but he twisted his body
at the last moment and lunged to make the catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``An amazing catch,'' Palmeiro said.
</P>
<P>
   Said right fielder Jason McDonald, ``I knew Scarborough can run
and I knew it was staying in the park so I thought he had a shot at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Green said he was playing shallow in case he had a shot at
throwing out Quinn on a short sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a good drop step, took three or four hard steps, found
the wall, then looked up and found the ball,'' Green said. ``I work
hard every day on fly balls over my head, so a catch that looks a
little harder for some people is easier for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn tagged up and scored easily, but Beltran, who was rounding
second and would have scored too, had to scamper back to first.
Loaiza then struck out Rey Sanchez to get out of the inning
trailing by just one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The play of the game,'' Oates said. ``How do you catch that?
That saved the game; that catch kept us in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Green's offensive contribution came with one out in the seventh
against reliever Jose Santiago. Green bounced a first-pitch bunt
off the plate and high into the air. Santiago came off the mound to
get it but threw to first base before second baseman Jeff Reboulet
could get there. The ball sailed into right-field foul territory,
and Green dashed all the way to third base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting on base is first and foremost on my mind,'' Green
said. ``Knowing the pitcher is not quick to the plate, I thought I
could steal on him if I got on base. It worked out pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis Alicea scored him with a single to left, making it a 3-3
game. After Chad Curtis popped out, Ivan Rodriguez lined a one-hop
double off the right-field wall that was touched by a fan, moving
Alicea to third. The umpires, on fan interference, have the right
to let Alicea score if they think he would have anyway. Oates
argued he would have, but the umpires disagreed and kept Alicea at
third.
</P>
<P>
   The five-minute argument didn't matter, because Palmeiro
followed with a single to right to score both runners.

 4 NEW JERSEY PREP SCHOOLERS FALL ILL AFTER BUYING DRUG ON eBAY  
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGHTSTOWN, N.J. _ With its lushly manicured campus, private
lake and neo-colonial buildings, the Peddie School provides its 500
students with a sheltered oasis seemingly far from the lures and
perils of the outside world. Supervision is intense, and the use of
drugs and alcohol is strictly forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   But the four 17-year-olds who were rushed to a hospital
emergency room on Tuesday night after the authorities found them
nearly unconscious did not have to leave their dormitory rooms to
purchase their highs.
</P>
<P>
   The students, the police and school officials said, overdosed on
a substance they bought on the Internet, a legal narcotic known as
dextromethorpan, or DXM, the active ingredient in over-the-counter
cough suppressants that can cause euphoria and mild hallucinations.
The four students, all of them juniors, were released from the
hospital the following day and are expected to recover.
</P>
<P>
   The incident has opened a door on what drug counselors and law
enforcement officials say are two growing problems: the increasing
popularity of DXM among teen-agers, and the murky world of Internet
drug sales. Because DXM is not an illegal substance, federal drug
officials do not keep statistics on its abuse. But poison control
centers around the country said they have seen a marked increase of
DXM overdoses in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Rock, a clinical pharmacist at the New Jersey Poison
Control Center, could not provide any figures but said reports of
DXM use had spiked in the last year. ``It's definitely gone way
up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Karen Simone, hotline manager of the Cincinnati Drug and
Poison Information Center, said the service handled 44 cases of DXM
overdose between January and April, compared with a handful during
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread availability, substance abuse experts say, makes DXM
the default drug of choice for teen-agers as young as 13. ``It's
not the most sophisticated drug, but if you don't have access to
alcohol or a designer drug, DXM is pretty easy to get,'' said Dr.
Eric Heiligenstein, a psychiatrist at the University of Wisconsin
who studies substance abuse among youth. ``All you have to do is go
into your parents' medicine cabinet, and it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   As the active ingredient in products like Robutussin, Vicks and
Nyquil, DXM is harmless if taken as prescribed. But if taken in
large doses, it can cause vomiting, high blood pressure, rapid
heartbeat and unconsciousness. In extreme cases, it can lead to
death.
</P>
<P>
   When police officers arrived at the Peddie School infirmary on
Tuesday evening, they found one student unresponsive, his face
flush and his pupils dilated, said Sgt. Rich Warshany of the
Hightstown Police Department. Shortly afterward, he said, the
officers found two girls off campus and another in a dormitory
room, their conditions nearly identical to that of the young man.
All four were taken to Princeton Medical Center and released after
a night of observation, a hospital spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The episode has jolted parents, students and teachers at what is
one of the state's most prestigious private schools. Administrators
held an assembly on Thursdayto remind the students of the school's
zero-tolerance drug policy. Samuel C. Tattersall, the dean of
students, said that in most cases, drug or alcohol use would result
in dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically the first time you are caught using, or with
paraphernalia, or under the influence, you're asked to leave,'' he
said, adding that the four students would face disciplinary
hearings and possible expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   While the use of dextromethorpan is not illegal, the Food and
Drug Administration prohibits its sale for any use other than as a
cough suppressant. Thomas McGinniss, the agency's director of
pharmacy affairs, said the Internet sale of such drugs has
skyrocketed in recent years. ``As soon as we close down a web site,
another one pops up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   School officials said the youths bought the packet of DXM on
eBay, the popular auction site. As of Thursday evening, the
substance was still being offered by two sellers. One of them, a
man from Amherst, Mass., was hawking 20 grams for $49. A
spokeswoman for eBay would not comment on the offering, saying she
had to consult with company lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Students at the 280-acre school said they were saddened by the
overdoses, but not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Leavy, 15, a sophomore, said she knew of friends who had
bought substances like DXM on the Internet. ``I have heard stories
about people getting all sorts of drugs and anything you could
possibly want,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Faith MacKenzie, a 17-year-old junior who is friends with the
four students, agreed. But she defended her classmates, saying they
were led astray by the the easy availability of the drug and the
hunger for new experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to do with the fact that it is here, that it's readily
accessible, and the fact that people are bored,'' she said.
``Anyone could have gotten it. A lot of people did. These are the
people taking the rap for it.''

HOUSING BOOM `OVER' IN PHOENIX AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY CATHERINE REAGOR  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - Phoenix area homes sales tumbled 5 percent in April,
confirming forecasts that the seven-year housing boom is virtually
over.
</P>
<P>
   The news Thursday, May 25, was the same nationally: Sales of
existing homes fell 7 percent in April, the National Association of
Realtors reported.
</P>
<P>
   The culprits in both cases are the same: interest rates at
five-year highs, rising home prices and a falling stock market that
has shaken potential buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longest-running housing boom in the Valley's history is
about to end,'' said home-building analyst R.L. Brown, who tracks
home sales here. ``The Fed has been telling us what the grand plan
is for months. The market is going to slow.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve hiked interest rates for the sixth time in
less than a year last week to tame runaway growth and curb
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The move sent mortgage rates soaring, prompting many analysts to
forecast a 9 percent home loan in the next few months. That rate is
the psychological barrier that will keep many buyers out of the
home market. The average 30-year mortgage rate was 8.62 percent,
almost even with last week.
</P>
<P>
   A slowing is even more evident in the Phoenix area's new-home
market. It's down 15 percent from a year earlier, after being
second only to Atlanta for new housing construction since 1997,
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in home sales comes despite continued job growth in the
Phoenix area. Phoenix's unemployment rate hit 3.6 percent in April,
a 31-year low.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a higher degree of uncertainty among consumers and
definite hesitation in the market among home buyers,'' said Brad
Inman, chief executive officer of the Internet real estate site
HomeGain.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 21,000 existing houses in the Phoenix area changed
hands for the first four months of 2000, vs. 23,000 in the first
four months of last year. The market set a record high last year
with nearly 70,000 resales.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 250,000 new homes have blanketed the Phoenix area
since 1993, and nearly double that many existing ones have sold.
</P>
<P>
   Escalating home prices play a part in the slowdown. The median
resale price in metro Phoenix recently hit $122,000, rising twice
as fast as personal income growth during the 1990s. Median
household income in the Phoenix area is about $40,000 a year. At
current mortgage rates, a family earning that much could afford a
$100,000 house with 10 percent down.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the current rate, Phoenix's slowing housing market would
still rate as hot by most cities' standards: At least 50,000
existing homes would change hands this year and 30,000 would be
built, or 136 closings and 82 housing starts a day. &QL;

AVALANCHE BEATS STARS, FORCES GAME 7
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ A second consecutive trip to the Stanley Cup Finals was
so close the Stars could almost reach out and touch it in the third
period Thursday night at the Pepsi Center.
</P>
<P>
   And then in a second, yesterday's chance was gone.
</P>
<P>
   In that second, a shot that looked to be sailing wide bounced
off Colorado forward Chris Drury's knee and past Stars goalie Ed
Belfour for the game-winning goal in the Avalanche's 2-1 victory in
Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, with three minutes and 51 seconds remaining, ensured
another game. Yes, the Stars will have to win Game 7 on Saturday
for another chance at the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I thought we dominated the third period, the
period we ended up losing,'' Stars captain Derian Hatcher said.
``It's one of those plays where the puck is going two feet or a
foot wide, and it hits in off someone. That stuff happens. Now,
it's a one-game deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars might have to play that game without one of their best
defensemen.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Matvichuk suffered a mild concussion 8 minutes and 47
seconds into the first period, when Colorado winger Dave Andreychuk
got his elbow up as he drove Matvichuk into the boards behind the
Stars' goal. Matvichuk's helmet popped off on contact, and his bare
head went crashing into the unforgiving glass. The Stars said he'll
be re-evaluated Friday morning, but they didn't sound optimistic
about his chances for Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``It pretty
simple. Rules should be pretty simple. If Matty is out, so should
No. 38.''
</P>
<P>
   Was he surprised there was no penalty on Andreychuk, No. 38?
</P>
<P>
   ``Shocked would be the word,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said the league is reviewing the
hit at the request of the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second consecutive game the Stars lost a key player
in the first period. They were already playing without one of their
top six forwards, Jamie Langenbrunner, who sprained his knee in
Game 5, and isn't expected back for Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this series is going to a Game 7. From the moment the
Stars and Avalanche took the ice almost two weeks ago you could
feel this one coming. The Avs' victory Thursday night simply
ensured the inevitable. The fight-for-every-inch-of-space,
no-victory-is-easy series now becomes a one-game, winner-take-all
affair to be held at 6 p.m. Saturday at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I said, everybody is talking about the season being long
but that's the only reason you play 82 games,'' Stars center Guy
Carbonneau said. ``Bonuses and the ice advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason they're playing is as simple as a couple of feet.
That much space, maybe less, was between Stars defensemen Darryl
Sydor and Sergei Zubov, and, through this opening, Avs defenseman
Ray Bourque's shot passed, deflected off Drury's knee and past
Belfour, who stopped 19 of 21 Colorado shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had 27 shots, but Avs goalie Patrick Roy stopped 26 of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for the first time in a while we outshot them and
probably outchanced them, too,'' Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk said.
``It was our game to win. Maybe, they feel like they had some they
could've won. It's just the way the series has gone. It's been
tough hockey. (Friday) we'll wake up and realize we have one game
left. It's our building, our fans.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is they could've woke up Friday morning and started
getting ready for the Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   In a game the Stars could've won, the Stars couldn't get the
shot, the bounce, the goal to end it. So the Avs did. It's the
first time since 1997 that the Stars have lost when they had a
chance to close out an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some great chances late, but that's playoff hockey,''
Stars winger Mike Keane said. ``Sometimes you deserve to win.
Sometimes you don't. So back in our building.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time since 1964 both Eastern and Western
conference finals are going to Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia and New Jersey are tied 3-3 with Game 7 tonight in
Philly. And now, the West will take seven games to be won, too.
</P>
<P>
   It almost was over. The Stars looked to have all the momentum
when winger Brett Hull scored his NHL-leading ninth goal of the
playoffs, a five-on-three power-play goal at 12:37 of the second
period. Zubov sent a cross-ice pass to Hull, who whistled a classic
one-timer that went between Roy's legs.
</P>
<P>
   With Drury already in the penalty box for tripping, referees had
whistled Adam Foote for his high stick to the face of Mike Modano.
Foote and Modano also had an ankle-to-ankle collision that caused
Modano to land awkwardly on his left leg. He left the ice at 11:50
of the second period, but returned five minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just locked knees and the stick caught me in the chin. It
wasn't anything major, a couple of bruises,'' Modano said. ``I
think he's tried to all series. I don't think it's a real mystery
what those guys are trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars converted on the five-on-three but couldn't take
advantage of the one minute and 14 seconds left in Foote's minor so
the game went into the second intermission tied at 1-1. The Avs'
goal was created by the most-criticized man in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado captain Joe Sakic had been a ``no show'' for most of
this series.
</P>
<P>
   He quieted that crowd in Game 6. Colorado's first goal began
with Sakic blocking a shot, carrying the puck down the ice and
making a perfect pass to a wide-open Bourque streaking into the
slot.
</P>
<P>
   All Bourque did was whistle a shot past Belfour at 4:30 of the
second period.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the series returns to Dallas
</P>
<P>
   ``I love our position,'' Avs coach Bob Hartley said. ``In
tonight's game, we generated momentum. We played a solid two-way
hockey game. We won lots of battles.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one more battle left to be won, though, and the Stars
say they feel confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said it after the game `One game on our home ice,'''
Hatcher said. ``Sure, I like our chances. If I didn't like our
chances, I wouldn't play.'' nn

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
The four-homer part of the script was believable, especially
considering the Astros' offensive firepower, not to mention the
likelihood of multiple home runs being hit at Enron Field.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But Joe Slusarski closing the game with three scoreless, almost
perfect innings was a surprise ending, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros outgunned the Philadelphia Phillies 10-6 Thursday
night in a game that featured seven home runs, including three
two-run shots by the Astros, who won a series for only the fourth
time this season and just the second time at home.
</P>
<P>
   But even in triumph, not all the news was good for the Astros.
Roger Cedeno fractured the fourth and fifth metacarpals on his left
hand and ruptured a tendon in his left ring finger while sliding
into first base on an infield single in the fourth inning. Cedeno
is headed for the disabled list and will be lost for six to eight
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to miss him,'' Astros second baseman Craig Biggio
said of Cedeno, the Astros' starting right fielder and leadoff
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   While Cedeno's specialty is speed, the Astros' offense
emphasized power Thursday, with Jeff Bagwell, Ken Caminiti and
Mitch Meluskey each hitting two-run homers.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hidalgo added a solo shot in what amounted to a slugfest
thanks to subpar starting pitching by Astros righthander Scott
Elarton and his mound opponent, Andy Ashby.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton's outing _ he allowed six runs in six innings _ was
masked by a well-rounded offensive attack and a redeeming
performance by Slusarski, whose clutch effort came at a time when
the bullpen needed it most.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense was good enough to score more than Elarton gave
up,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``We had a good offensive
game, but Slusarski was the biggest story of this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Slusarski's ERA dropped to a team-low 2.70 after Thursday's
performance. And to think he was deemed unworthy of a roster spot
at the end of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely moving up in the pecking order,'' Dierker said
of Slusarski, who was promoted from Class AAA New Orleans on May 5.
``He's doing what the others aren't. He's hitting corners.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first save of Slusarski's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy to get the job done,'' he said. ``The bullpen
has gotten a lot of criticism, and most of it has been deserved.
We're going through a spell right now. Hopefully, this is something
that will pick us up.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory represented a milestone for Dierker, who became the
fastest manager to reach 300 victories in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm just hoping I can remain the manager for a
while,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton, despite a 9.00 ERA in his last two starts, improved to
3-1 as the Astros won for just the second time in their last 10
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good,'' Elarton said. ``I don't think the results are
reflective of the way I felt. I just made too many bad pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies took a 2-0 first-inning lead on Bob Abreu's third
homer in as many at-bats, dating to Wednesday. The former Astro's
latest bomb, a two-run shot into the right-field seats, extended
his hitting streak to five games.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell's two-run homer tied the score in the bottom of the
inning, and the Astros took a 3-2 lead on Hidalgo's sacrifice fly.
The fast start at the plate was nothing new for the Astros, who
have scored 18 runs in the first three innings of their last five
games.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton retired 10 of the next 11 batters he faced after Abreu's
home run, then created trouble for himself with a pair of two-out
walks to Kevin Jordan and Mickey Morandini in the fourth inning.
Desi Relaford made Elarton pay with a triple into the
right-center-field gap.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo's team-leading 15th homer tied the score 4-4 in the
fifth, and the Astros added two more runs on Cedeno's infield
single and a subsequent throwing error by Phillies rookie first
baseman Pat Burrell.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros stretched their lead to 8-4 on Caminiti's two-run
homer in the fifth. Caminiti had only one hit in his 10 at-bats
prior to the home run, his 11th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Burrell atoned for his fourth-inning error with the first homer
of his big-league career in the sixth. His solo shot off the train
tracks and a solo homer by Relaford pulled the visitors within 8-6.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros reclaimed their four-run lead on Meluskey's
eighth-inning homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to be getting excited,'' Meluskey said of the
Astros' winning two of three from lowly Philadelphia. ``The
Phillies are struggling, too. Let's see what we do against the
Braves this weekend. Let's try to get seven or eight out of 10.''

   Los Angeles Unified School District board members interviewed
Romer on Thursday and hope to meet the remaining two as soon as
possible, perhaps by Tuesday, she said. Members declined to name
those two candidates, although sources close to the search said one
is an educator while the other comes from outside the field.
</P>
<P>
   The three finalists have been whittled from a list of 11
candidates whose names were forwarded to the board by the search
committee, Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas many candidates already have withdrawn their names from
consideration, all three people left in the running told the search
committee that they want the job, Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not us trying to beg someone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, board members said that if they can't agree on
a choice from among those three, they may try yet again to convince
interim Superintendent Ramon Cortines to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Cortines, however, has repeatedly said he plans to leave the
district at the end of his term, which expires June 30. Although
some on the board hope they could appeal to his sense of
responsibility to the district and its students, they acknowledge
convincing him would be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to play upon his sense of civic duty when he's
already done so much,'' said board member Caprice Young. ``Really,
the most important thing for us to do now is look forward, and that
means finding a new superintendent.''
</P>
<P>
   Cortines said he didn't think the board would need him to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board is in a serious process, and they will find a
superintendent,'' he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one predicted an easy search, the hunt for Cortines'
replacement has been difficult. Many of the 11 candidates brought
to the board by the search committee already have bowed out. And
with Sacramento legislators threatening to appoint a watchdog to
oversee the district's operations, many Los Angeles Unified
officials worry that no one of the caliber needed for the job would
want to take it on.
</P>
<P>
   The post, which could pay more than $200,000 a year, includes
the oversight of 67,000 employees and 711,000 students in
kindergarten through 12th grade.

CALIFORNIA DOCTORS SUE THREE HMOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

story.)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The California Medical Association, representing
34,000 doctors, filed a federal lawsuit Thursday claiming that
three of the state's largest managed-care companies are causing a
massive medical crisis by putting profits ahead of patients' needs.
</P>
<P>
   The landmark civil action in U.S. District Court in San
Francisco charges that the companies _ Blue Cross of California,
PacifiCare Health Systems and Foundation Health Systems _ are
violating federal anti-racketeering laws and interfering with
doctors' ability to treat their patients.
</P>
<P>
   In its 40-page complaint, the CMA says the companies pay rates
for services that do not cover doctors' costs, unjustly delay and
deny payments for necessary treatments, and use their financial
clout to impose unfair contract terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to send a message, loud and clear, that doctors simply
cannot take it anymore,'' CMA President Marie Kuffner said. ``The
real problem is decisions that get made are not based on needs of
patients. They're based on the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   HMO industry officials denounced the doctors' position Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Kalustian, a spokeswoman for HealthNet, a subsidiary of
Woodland Hills-based Foundation Health Systems, said the lawsuit
would drain money from an already-troubled health care system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry has been willing to sit down with the California
Medical Association and talk about their concerns,'' she said.
``Let's sit in the conference room instead of the courtroom.''
</P>
<P>
   The CMA suit claims that the companies' actions fall under
anti-racketeering laws because they involve mail fraud, wire fraud
and illegal interference with the patient-doctor relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The association _ which is seeking class-action status for the
lawsuit _ is asking the court to enjoin the companies from
prohibiting the payment of reimbursement adequate to cover the
costs of delivering the health care that doctors promise to
patients and from engaging in what the CMA called ``fraudulent and
extortionate policies and practices.'' The three for-profit
companies insure about 9 million Californians, according to the
association.
</P>
<P>
   CMA officials said the lawsuit is a last resort after separate
negotiations with elected officials, regulators and the companies
failed. Archie Lamb, a Birmingham, Ala., attorney involved in
recent suits against the tobacco industry, is leading the CMA's
legal team.
</P>
<P>
   The action is one of dozens of lawsuits across the nation that
are attempting to use the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act, or RICO, to challenge health maintenance
organizations. But industry analysts said it is the first such
lawsuit initiated by a medical association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorneys (who) are driving this suit come directly from
the tobacco industry class-action attempts,'' said Michael Chee, a
spokesman for Woodland Hills-based Blue Cross, a subsidiary of
Thousand Oaks-based WellPoint Health Networks Inc. ``They have one
motive and one motive only, and that's to make money for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit had little effect on the companies' stocks Thursday.
PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. closed down 25 cents at $59.75,
Foundation Health Systems closed down 12.5 cents at $11.88, and
Wellpoint closed up 37.5 cents at $74.06.
</P>
<P>
   But some patient care advocates applauded the CMA action.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Court, advocacy director for the Foundation for Taxpayer &AMP;
Consumer Rights, said the move would add weight to the effort to
reform the industry. Court's Santa Monica-based foundation has
filed four suits against Kaiser and Aetna.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad doctors are joining us in this arena because it
adds a lot of power to the claims we have made,'' Court said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients think their medical care providers are there to help
them, but these corporations have put policies in place that
preclude physicians from doing their jobs,'' Court said. ``The HMOs
are acting unfairly and in some cases illegally.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Johnston, chairman of the board of trustees of the Los
Angeles County Medical Association, said a recent emergency room
case underscored problems with the HMO system.
</P>
<P>
   He said that case involved a young woman with severe stomach
problems who had waited a year for an ultrasound, a routine
diagnostic procedure, because of long delays in insurance company
authorization. When Johnston performed the ultrasound, he said he
discovered gallstones that had incapacitated the woman for days.
</P>
<P>
   ``This woman needed treatment. She needed surgery,'' Johnston
said. ``She did not need authorization.''
</P>
<P>
   Chee, the Blue Cross spokesman, said such problems are rare.
``They're very small, very limited, and they do not represent the
majority of patients in the health care system.''
</P>
<P>
   If doctors extracted larger reimbursements from insurance
companies, it would push up patients' premiums and add to the
number of uninsured in the state, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our net profit from premiums (is) ... only 3 or 4 cents on the
dollar. The dollars are all part of the same financial system. If
you put pressure on one area, that bubble has got to expand
somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   CMA officials counter that the industry is diverting money to
stockholders, executive bonuses and unnecessary layers of
management that should go to patient care.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're ripping the system off,'' Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   Court, the consumer advocate, said market forces are only part
of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The free market does not say that you can violate medical
ethics and medical practice protocols that are protected under
state law,'' he said. ``The free market doesn't mean you can ignore
customary responsibilities under an insurance contract to provide
medically necessary care.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``This industry is going to face its day in court.
Whether it wins or not is a whole other issue.''

CARDINAL MAHONY ASKS GOVERNOR TO STOP EXECUTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HILLBURG 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Cardinal Roger Mahony urged California Gov. Gray
Davis on Thursday to impose an immediate moratorium on executions,
saying there was growing evidence that innocent men and women may
be facing the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Mahony, Archbishop of Los Angeles, announced his request, made
to Davis in a faxed letter, during a speech at the National Press
Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Gov. Davis is very strong for the death penalty,'' said
Mahony. ``But there are doubts about so many cases. We need to stop
so the California justice system can be thoroughly assessed and the
inequities, weaknesses and biases in the process can be revealed
fully.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bustamante, Davis' press secretary, said the governor
had not had time to fully review Mahony's letter but added, ``There
is no reason to believe there is any problem with executions in
California.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahony cited the example of Illinois Gov. George Ryan, who
temporarily halted executions in February after investigators,
including a group of college students, proved the innocence of
several men on the state's Death Row. All Illinois capital cases
and legal procedures are now undergoing exhaustive reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Mahony did not cite any specific Death Row cases in California
that he believes are flawed. Instead, he said the Illinois cases
suggest the chance some residents of California's Death Row may
have been incorrectly convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante said he was unfamiliar with the Illinois situation,
but noted ``every death penalty case in California is heard by at
least two juries and three judges before it ever gets to the
governor. Gov. Davis would be hard pressed to run counter to the
verdicts of those juries and the rulings of those judges.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Mahony said he hoped a moratorium would be the
first step toward a ban on executions. He reiterated the Roman
Catholic Church's opposition to the death penalty, saying: ``I do
not believe that society is made safer, that our communities are
made whole, or that our social fabric is strengthened by killing
those who kill others.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahony also said he and the church are not opposed to life
sentences without the possibility of parole for violent criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state has an obligation to protect its citizens against
dangerous persons,'' said Mahony. ``But people can change their
ways and make positive contributions to society even in prison. The
death penalty negates any chance for that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal is in Washington this week to chair a meeting of
the U.S. Catholic Conference Committee on Domestic Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Mahony clashed publicly over the death penalty in
1999, when the cardinal asked the governor to grant clemency -- and
a life sentence -- to Jaturun Siripongs, who had been convicted of
killing two people during a 1981 store robbery in Garden Grove.
</P>
<P>
   Davis denied the request and Siripongs, a Thai national who
claimed he was innocent of the murders, was put to death by lethal
injection Feb. 9, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed the death penalty as it
was enforced in most states on the grounds it was not being applied
even-handedly. The ruling commuted the death sentences of
California's Death Row inmates, including Charles Manson, who were
given life terms instead.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature restored capital punishment in 1977 with a new
death penalty law that passed constitutional muster. Executions
resumed in 1992. Since then, eight inmates have been put to death.
An additional 565 prisoners -- 554 men and 11 women -- await
execution on the state's Death Row.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent California execution was that of Darrell Young
Elk Rich, who was put to death by lethal injection March 15.
</P>
<P>
   Rich was sentenced to death in 1982 for the brutal 1978 murders
of three women and an 11-year-old girl in Shasta County. He spent
18 years on Death Row appealing his sentence.

 Another new ballpark won't cure game's problems  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Red Sox need a new house. The majority of New Englanders
will not dispute that. They may not agree on the cost _ ``$627 mil?
For a new place? Can't you find something cheaper?'' And they may
not agree on the prioritizing _ ``The Sox aren't the only folks in
the city who'd like to move and can't afford to do it by
themselves.'' But if you were to argue the usefulness of
88-year-old Fenway Park, you'd eventually find yourself arguing the
inarguable.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every current Sox player can say, without exaggeration,
``Fenway is older than my grandmother.'' The place is beyond
needing new drapes, new paint, and, this year, a new (and
underused) center-field scoreboard. Standing next to Fenway, my own
Flappers Era granny looks like a GenX rapper. And, yes, she would
also say it's time to move.
</P>
<P>
   John Harrington and Dan Duquette have convinced me of that. But
I doze when they try to persuade the public that a new park is
needed. To me, it's like telling someone that they can find a lot
of green space at Boston Common. What gets my attention, though, is
the annoying and hypocritical section of the plea. The essence of
that argument usually develops like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the park to remain competitive . . . Other teams in
baseball are using revenue streams from new parks to gain a
competitive advantage and we can't keep up . . . The Yankees are
going to lap us.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Sox are right about the sad financial dynamics of
baseball. What they don't say is that they have benefited from the
system's Have and Have Not imbalance. They are understandably
protesting it now, because the system is wacked. But if they were
honest with themselves, they would acknowledge the problem they now
face has more to do with baseball's administrative offices in New
York rather than political offices on Beacon Hill.
</P>
<P>
   I may have missed the monologue, but I didn't hear any Sox
executives urgently speaking about the divide between baseball's
upper and lower classes in 1997 and 1999. That divide is the only
reason Pedro Martinez and Carl Everett are in Boston today. If
baseball had its financial house in order, there is no way the
Montreal Expos _ one of the game's faces of abject poverty _ would
have traded a Cy Young Award winner for a couple of minor leaguers
in '97. If baseball had something sensible, such as revenue sharing
and/or a salary cap, you wouldn't see the Houston Astros trade
their No. 4 hitter (Everett) for a kid (Adam Everett) who is now
trying to hit his weight in Triple A. And the Astros have a new
park this year.
</P>
<P>
   Most owners will tell you that this classism results from a
powerful and inflexible players' union. They tell you that the
players bristle at a salary cap because they believe it will limit
how much they can earn. The candid owners also acknowledge that
everyone in management does not endorse revenue sharing.
</P>
<P>
   If you put the aforementioned scenes together, you have a short
horror film. The significant new revenue of which the Sox wistfully
speak may not seem so significant to them in five years. Two years
from now, their payroll will exceed $100 million (it's close to $80
million now). It could be as high as $130 million by the time their
park opens. If that keeps up, a new park alone is not going to save
them. Instead, we'll see the Red Sox trying to raise additional
funds via car washes and Girl Scout cookie sales.
</P>
<P>
   Do the Sox need a new park? Of course. I am short and even I
struggle to find leg room in Fenway's tiny aisles. Take comfort out
of it and, if you are interested in actually seeing the game, you
might be better off watching at home rather than sitting in some
obstructed-view seats. There are other problems (purists call them
``idiosyncrasies'', but they are problems), but it would take an
entire column to enumerate them.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I am too optimistic, but I expect to see the new
40,000-plus-seat Fenway long before Chelsea Clinton tries to become
the first president's daughter to make a run for the White House.
But what will the new park do for the Sox if baseball doesn't have
a new way of doing business by then? It's good that 26 of the 29
teams will have a new home or blueprints for one by 2003. Who
doesn't enjoy going to a new home and saying to the host, ``So,
give me the tour!'' But if the majority of teams have new parks and
new revenue, won't they run into the same class issues if the
owners don't get the deal they want when this labor agreement
expires in 2001? The Tigers and Giants have new homes this year,
but it seems improbable that either of those teams will ever have
the Gateslike payroll of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington and Duquette speak as if a new park will solve their
problems, as well as yours; I am skeptical. Harrington says the
Sox' ticket prices are higher than he would like. The suggestion is
that they are high because the Sox have the oldest and smallest
park in the league, forcing them to inflate prices to generate
income. Does that mean fans can anticipate middle-of-the-pack
prices when the new home is in place? And what of the parking
garages the Sox want built? If the garages are supposed to be part
of a public-private marriage, does that mean fans will not need
payment plans in order to park in Sox-run facilities?
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that baseball is a fractured game, financially.
Pouring millions of dollars into stadia may stem some of the
problems. It won't stop them. Teams such as Minnesota and Florida
are on a Buck-a-Book budget when they attempt to pay players (The
Martinez brothers have a higher combined salary than the Twins'
entire payroll). If Harrington and Duquette want to have a frank
dialogue about what it takes to remain competitive, they should
talk about that.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, there needs to be a compromise to ensure that everyone
gets the most out of their money. Lawmakers should give the Sox the
cash they seek; the Sox should try to fix their dilapidated game.
If the game is not repaired, you may not see Sox executives with
their hands out, but you'll still feel their oppressive pull on
your purses and wallets.

 Blue Jays beat Red Sox
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Blue Jays11Red Sox6
</P>
<P>
   Well, you couldn't ask for more drama. Of course, the Red Sox
could have done without quite as much.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of their fourth loss in five games, an 11-6 pasting
by the Toronto Blue Jays at Fenway Park before 32,716 restless
fans, the Sox flew to New York Thursday knowing that when they
landed, they would have company in first place in the American
League East.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, meanwhile, blasted the White Sox, 7-0, in Chicago
and thus erased Boston's one-game lead. That leaves the Sox with no
margin for error this weekend at Yankee Stadium when the blood
rivals clash for three games in the Showdown of the Century (so
what if the century is less than five months old?).
</P>
<P>
   Talk about excitement . . . actually, most of the Sox didn't
want to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't talking about New York,'' said center fielder Carl
Everett, shooing away the pestiferous press. ``Skedaddle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's early,'' said pitcher Tim Wakefield. ``It's the first
series. It's May still. If it was September, I'd be worried.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just another team to us,'' said catcher Scott
Hatteberg. ``We're not saying, `Oh my God, it's the Yankees.' No
one in this room is even thinking about them.''
</P>
<P>
   At least the man in the adjacent room, the manager's office,
was. But Jimy Williams was willing to acknowledge New York's
existence only because it's the next stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're on our schedule; now we can start thinking about
them,'' he said. ``Yeah, we've got to get ready for the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the meantime, the Sox can't forget those interlopers from
the north. By taking two of three here, the Blue Jays climbed
within four games of first place. Which, to the Sox' dismay, has
another occupant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, they'll beat the heck out of each other in New
York,'' said irrepressible David ``Boomer'' Wells, who notched his
league-leading eighth win against two losses, allowing 10 hits and
four runs in seven innings plus. ``Boston has a great team. New
York has a great team. We have an OK team right now. But I don't
mind being the sleeper. I'll take that every time.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, fitness freak Wells had reason to puff out his beer
belly as he overcame his dismal Boston track record. Along with his
generous gut, he lugged in a Fenway career mark of 6-10 and a 5.71
earned run average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never done well here,'' said Wells. ``I'm cursed. It's
the curse of the Boomer. Boston always beats my ass.''
</P>
<P>
   Not this time. Wells was the beneficiary of a Boston beating for
a change as the Blue Jays pounded out 17 hits against loser Pete
Schourek (2-4), Tim Wakefield, John Wasdin, and Tim Young. They
beefed up their league-leading home run total to 81 as Shannon
Stewart and Todd Greene went deep off Schourek, who left beneath a
4-1 deficit after four innings, and Carlos Delgado tagged
Wakefield, who was bullied for six hits and five runs in two
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart added a double and triple as he just missed the cycle;
Delgado knocked in three runs and Tony Batista drove in two; Darrin
Fletcher went 3 for 5, including a triple; and Craig Grebeck and
Jose Cruz contributed a pair of hits each as Toronto gave the Sox
something to remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try to change their thinking,'' said Batista of
the New York-Boston hubbub. ``They're pretty good teams. We are,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   He'd get no argument from Wakefield, who is just recovering from
a sore throat and fever that forced him to leave the park early a
couple of days ago, and wished he'd stayed in bed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's no excuse,'' Wakefield said of his health. ``I pitched
like (expletive). Pete doesn't deserve the loss; I do. I should
have been able to hold them for two or three innings and I didn't
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Wells, who had been tattooed _ and we don't mean the
ones depicting his family members that he wears on his right arm,
above his left breast, and across his back _ in his last start when
the White Sox collected 10 hits and six runs at his expense in just
3 1/3 innings, endured no such indignity this time.
</P>
<P>
   He was facing a lineup that Williams appeared to have poured out
of a blender. With Jose Offerman idled by a left groin injury
suffered Wednesday and Trot Nixon sitting out against the
lefthander, Williams made good on his perpetual vow to ``play 'em
all; they're major leaguers and they're here for a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Leadoff batter Darren Lewis (2 for 5, 2 runs), normally a right
fielder, played left as Williams tried to save wear and tear on the
ailing left hamstring that had idled the veteran since last week.
Donnie Sadler, who has been pitching in for the disabled Nomar
Garciaparra at shortstop, took Nixon's place in right and moved
from ninth to second in the order. Jeff Frye (3 for 4, 1 run),
starting his second straight game at second base, was the unlikely
No. 3 hitter. Another lefthanded batter, Brian Daubach _ hero of
Wednesday's palpitating marathon with a three-run 11th-inning homer
that produced a 6-3 victory _ gave way to Mike Stanley (2 for 5, 2
RBIs) at first base and in the cleanup spot. Both catchers, Jason
Varitek and Hatteberg (1 for 4, double), were on duty, Varitek as
the designated hitter. Wilton Veras (2 for 5) replaced John
Valentin at third base, and Manny Alexander was at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   This patchwork assemblage provided the most production Boston
has received during the homestand, collecting 13 hits, including
Everett's 14th homer, a two-run garbage-time shot in the ninth. But
they didn't harm Wells when it mattered.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing, 1-0, in the second, Wells stranded runners at second
and third by striking out Alexander. After the Jays put him in Fat
City by opening a 6-1 lead in the fifth, Wells was staring at a tie
game in the bottom of the inning when the Sox pushed across a run
and loaded the bases with two out. This time he struck out Varitek
as the unsparing Boston crowd booed; what would they have done if
they hadn't been watching a first-place team?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a habit of getting out of jams and also getting into
them,'' said Wells.
</P>
<P>
   He left the Sox in a rut _ they dropped back-to-back series (to
bottom-feeder Detroit and Toronto) for the first time since the
opening trip of the season. Meanwhile, the Blue Jays made amends
for losing two of three to Boston last week in SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kicked the (expletive) out of us up there, so it was nice
to do the same thing to them down here,'' said Wells. ``We made a
little statement.''
</P>
<P>
   The message is something the Sox and Yankees would be well
advised to ponder during their summit meeting: It's a three-team
race.

 Bourque, Avalanche force Stars to Game 7  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Ray Bourque's dream, which only 48 hours before was
fading toward oblivion, Thursday sharpened focus and turned into a
fairy tale.
</P>
<P>
   After earlier scoring the night's first goal, the former Bruins
captain fired off a 55-foot pass that Chris Drury tipped home with
3:51 remaining in regulation, leading the Avalanche to a 2-1
victory over Dallas in Game 6 of the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, now 21 years into his pursuit of the Stanley Cup, will
lead the Avalanche into Dallas for Game 7 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why I came here,'' said the Boston icon, dealt to the
Avalanche at the trading deadline, wanting to get at least one more
viable shot at winning the Cup. ``I don't think I've been as
aggressive as I'd like to be, but games like this you want to go
out and do more _ play better.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque was out of character when he nailed in the go-ahead goal
with 4:30 gone in the second period. After Joe Sakic blocked a shot
in the netural zone and broke over the blue line, right wing,
Bourque came barreling down the slot as the trailer and collected
Sakic's soft dish. Closing toward Eddie Belfour, Bourque took aim
as if it were the NHL's midseason shooting accuracy contest,
breakable plates festooning the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``The targets are a lot easier than shooting at Belfour,'' said
Bourque, laughing at the comparison. ``Belfour covers a lot of net,
and I didn't see any plates hanging back there. No targets. I
really didn't shoot it that hard. It was the quickness, I think,
that did it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were back with the equalizer a little more than eight
minutes later, legendary sniper Brett Hull finishing a 5-on-3 power
play with a doorstep one-time slam off a Sergei Zubov feed.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the Stars, who lost defenseman Richard Matvichuk
early in the first period when ex-Bruin Dave Andreychuk delivered
an elbow to his head, controlled much of the play after scoring the
tying goal. From the start of that 5-on-3, they went on to roll up
a 14-7 shot advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play as well tonight as maybe we did in Games 4 and
5, but we lost those games,'' said Bourque. ``All this is only
about winning, that's all. You take it and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque was fresh off the bench, rushing to his customary spot
at left defense, as the winning goal developed. Drury, the ex-BU
star and Hobey Baker winner, missed on a shot that caromed around
the boards and went to Bourque. Editor's note: This is not a Disney
script. Bourque retrieved it just inside the blue line and wristed
it back toward the crease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was going to be 8 feet off the net,'' said Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't. It was in the net. Camped near the right post
like some security dog, Drury muscled closer to Belfour and got
something _ a knee, a stick, a four-leaf clover _ on it and
deflected it past Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might have nicked my stick,'' said Drury, with face from
all-night poker match. Hitchcock was convinced it hit Drury's knee.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle of the night, though, was Bourque's goal. After
seeing it nestle into the top right corner and drop behind the goal
line, Bourque curled back into the slot, dropped to a knee, and
began pumping his right arm in conquest _ the old warrior
transformed as if a teenager once more, all adrenaline and joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any who watched me in Boston over the years,'' said Bourque,
``know that I sometimes like to bring the pump out like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another ex-Bruin, Avalanche winger Dave Reid, marveled at the
goal and the assist, but was equally impressed by a vintage Bourque
play that came after the winning goal. With about two minutes to
go, Hull was alone in front, puck within his grasp, and Bourque
galloped back to knock it to the junkyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was winding up for a shot,'' said Reid, knowing how lethal
those Hull blasts can be. ``But that's Ray _ the great goal, the
great assist, and still getting back to make the perfect defensive
play.''
</P>
<P>
   One more victory and Bourque will be back in the finals for the
first time since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know what's going on,'' said Drury, referring to the
blanket awareness of Bourque's Cup pursuit. ``We don't talk about
it every day, and no one's making rah-rah speeches _ but everyone
wants it for him.''

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Ehud Barak's election promise to end Israel's
22-year occupation of a slice of southern Lebanon was brave as well
as popular. Israel's dark military adventure into Lebanon was never
its proudest hour.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years it has caused the death, directly or indirectly,
of many thousands of people and few Israelis could see much reason
for continuing to risk their soldiers' lives by staying on.
</P>
<P>
   This week's dramatic events, which turned an orderly withdrawal
into a disorderly rout, should not detract from the wisdom of the
decision to get out.
</P>
<P>
   But the chaos, as Israel's proxy militiamen took to their heels,
forcing its own soldiers to beat a rapid retreat _ and thus leaving
the Hezbollah guerrillas in control _ adds markedly to the
tribulations of Barak as he battles to make peace with his Arab
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Peace with Syria was top of the prime minister's original list.
Although Syria's military strength has declined as quickly as
Israel's has swollen, President Hafez Assad has not lost his talent
for mischief-making, let alone his overall control of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   A Syrian deal would have gone far to putting a full stop to half
a century of Israeli-Arab hostility. It would also have opened the
way for a graceful exit from Lebanon, since no Lebanese government
can make peace with Israel until Syria does so first.
</P>
<P>
   A permanent agreement with the Palestinians, though desirable,
was secondary in Barak's book. To start with, all went well. Assad
and Barak exchanged effusive compliments. The Syrian seemed
genuinely keen on peace: he wanted to clear things for his son and
heir, and he sought a new and more profitable relationship with the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In January, talks were held in West Virginia, taking off from
the point at which discussions in Maryland had ended four years
before. There was a hiccup when an Israeli newspaper leaked
details, but both sides seemed to feel that a deal was possible.
</P>
<P>
   Israel had agreed to withdraw from the Golan Heights in return
for security arrangements and normal, peaceful relations. But when
U.S. President Bill Clinton tried to clinch the understanding with
Assad, it turned out that both sides thought the other had given
way on the exact position of the border: a tiny matter of a few
hundred meters but crucial to both.
</P>
<P>
   Since neither side would give a meter, the talks, at least for
now, have collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's response was to reaffirm that he would go ahead
regardless with Israel's unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon by July
7. He also, for lack of an alternative, turned his fuller attention
to the faltering talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Retreat is ever a hazardous business, but Israel had hoped that
its imminent departure, plus the threat of massive retaliation,
would keep the Syrians and Lebanese quiet while it went about the
business of getting its soldiers out and building new
fortifications on the border.
</P>
<P>
   No such luck, even though a foretaste of retaliation was
delivered when Israel bombed Lebanon's power stations earlier this
month. Lebanon's guerrillas merely increased their attacks on the
South Lebanon Army, the Israeli-run militia. And the militia lost
its nerve.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis had never decided what to do about this force _
beyond hoping that it would cover their retreat. The question of
where the soldiers should go when their protectors departed was
left unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, mostly Christian Lebanese, might look to
comfortable retirement in France, but the rank-and-file would be on
their own. If they stayed in Lebanon, should they keep their arms?
Confusion thus reigned, awaiting catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the militiamen took matters into their own hands by
simply running away, fleeing with their families ino Israel, and
abandoning their weapons to the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Lebanon's rejoicing at Israel's ``expulsion,'' and its
proxy army's flight or surrender, could be short.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, in its triumph, may be showing a certain
responsibility. Yet if one of Lebanon's militant forces, with or
without Syria's consent, decides to continue the war by lobbing a
rocket into northern Israel, retribution will be swift and
terrible.
</P>
<P>
   And the new order of battle will, according to Israel's chief of
staff, take the form of a bombardment against ``all the
power-holding elements in Lebanon, including Syrian targets in
Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   The troubles facing Barak in the West Bank and Gaza are far less
dramatic than this week's flight from Lebanon. However, if the
obstacles that stand in the way of a political agreement with the
Palestinians are not surmounted pretty soon, the vacuum in policy
could have even uglier consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations have stumbled along, making little progress. The
poverty of results has left the Palestinians dangerously
disenchanted and volatile, almost as angry with their own leaders
as with Israel's.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations quickly flare into violence, as they did in the
West Bank last week when Israel's nightmare _ a gunfight between
the well-armed Palestinian police and the Israeli army _ came
briefly true. The police soon turned their attention to calming
their own people, but the shooting gave a glimpse into a
frightening future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The present is our problem. The future will be their
problem,'' says an East Jerusalemite who believes that, although
Israel holds all the best cards at present, the Palestinians have
demography and determination on their side, and it is these that
will tell in the end. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 900, OR CONTINUE TO 1,150) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is true that a lot of wild words are heard in the West Bank
these days, as Palestinians, whose standard of living drops by the
day, rage at principles betrayed, or about to be betrayed.
Disillusion goes deep. And it is probably worth noting that
Islamists have recently been winning quite a few student and
trade-union elections.
</P>
<P>
   With several deadlines already missed, it is vitally important
that Barak and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinians' leader, come to a
quick and sensible agreement, even if not a comprehensive one.
</P>
<P>
   But, though Barak is prepared to offer the Palestinians more
than his predecessor did, his government still gives the
impression, as its predecessor did, that any Israeli measures that
advance a peaceful solution are ``concessions'' for which the
Palestinians should be duly grateful.
</P>
<P>
   They are not grateful, of course, and nor were the Lebanese, let
alone the Syrians. The belief that they might say thank-you and
behave nicely is mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis feel that when they have done something good _ ceasing
to occupy part of Lebanon, for instance _ the Arabs should
acknowledge this and respond in kind. But the Arabs are as
bloody-minded as anybody else, and they cherish a long, deep grudge
against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Which means that Barak, who does seem to be trying hard to do
the right thing, has to try even harder. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ ``A taboo has been broken.'' The vote was
``historic.'' There has been a ``reconciliation of Switzerland with
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   To judge by the gushing enthusiasm of Swiss Europhiles, you
would think that the result of the referendum on May 21, in which
67 percent of the voters approved a deal to open Switzerland up to
the European Union, was nothing less than an end to Swiss
isolationism, and an unambiguous endorsement of efforts to tempt
the country into the EU.
</P>
<P>
   That would be overstating its significance. Yet the surprising
strength of the pro-European vote does suggest that something is
stirring in this stubbornly independent-minded nation.
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to see why the Euro-enthusiasts were celebrating.
The referendum sought Swiss popular backing for seven bilateral
agreements with the EU, to come into force in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Each dismantles barriers between the two, prising the landlocked
country open to the Union.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements include one to let big trucks from other EU
countries thunder across Switzerland, in return for the Swiss right
to tax them for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Another would end the job-quota system that restricts the free
movement of people between the EU and the Alpine country, under
which the Swiss can roam freely inside the EU from 2003 but need
not return the favor fully until 2013.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, although the deal was always expected to pass, chiefly
because it was backed by all the four parties in the federal
government, the strength of approval came as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the Euro-enthusiastic French-speakers, who account for
only 17 percent of Swiss citizens, were keen: 80 percent of the
canton of Vaud, next to Lake Geneva, for example, backed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But this time the vote also bridged the linguistic divide
between them and their German-speaking countrymen: in Zurich, the
most populous canton, no less than 70 percent of voters said yes.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of the country's 26 cantons, Italian-speaking Ticino _
which seemed to fear an influx of job-grabbing ``foreigners'' from
neighboring Italy _ and conservative Schwyz, in its mountain
fastness, said no.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the oddity of the result was that, while the Europhiles
declared it was their victory, so too did those who fiercely reject
any efforts to join the EU.
</P>
<P>
   The populist Swiss People's Party, which astounded its
detractors by snatching second place at the parliamentary election
last year, claimed that the deal went through precisely because it
dishes out to the Swiss just as little of Europe as they want: the
economic benefits, without any loss of sovereignty to Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   In short, they say, the question about joining the Union is now
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Who is right? Switzerland has long been ambivalent about opening
up. On the one hand, its businesses are highly international. It
has two of Europe's top five banks.
</P>
<P>
   Only this week, its bourse, Swiss Exchange, the world's
sixth-biggest, announced that it and London's Tradepoint were
planning a new pan-European exchange for blue-chip stocks. It sends
doctors into war zones worldwide, most famously through the Red
Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-fifth of the Swiss population, who live under a
multilingual constitution, is foreign. Yet, at the same time, the
Swiss People's Party, which urges a clampdown on asylum-seekers and
carries echoes of Joerg Haider's Freedom Party in neighboring
Austria, is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants seeking Swiss citizenship are already subject to a
humiliating beauty parade in their local canton before a vote is
held on their suitability for the honor.
</P>
<P>
   And the country jealously guards its totems of an independence
that borders on isolation: namely, neutrality, and non-membership
of such bodies as the EU and the United Nations, not to mention
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Swiss, and particularly the older German-speakers,
seem happy to live with this disjunction. But plenty of younger
Swiss, especially in French-speaking parts like Geneva, regret the
sense of aloofness and apartness, from fellow Europeans in
particular, that they feel it brings.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to their system of direct democracy, Swiss politicians
are coy about offering leadership, taking their cue instead from
the popular mood. They would never dare to push against the general
will.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the government, though it backs in principle an
application to join the EU, insisted that this week's referendum
had nothing to do with EU membership. Next month, parliament has to
decide whether to back a referendum proposal to begin negotiations
to join.
</P>
<P>
   After this week's result, it may well be that Switzerland's
politicians can afford to be less cautious about offering a lead.
Their silence merely leaves the way open for extremists. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ After threats of war, the dangers of peace.
</P>
<P>
   For Taiwan's new president, Chen Shui-bian, who took office on
May 20, it has been a heartening week. His inauguration marked the
first democratic transfer of power in 5,000 years of Chinese
history. Taiwan, he proclaimed, echoing Mao's words when the
Communists took power on the mainland in 1949, has stood up.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the event provoked no new crisis with China, which still
insists that there is but one China, that Taiwan is a part of it,
and that the government in Beijing is in charge.
</P>
<P>
   It has long threatened to invade if Taiwan declares
independence. Earlier this year it threatened to attack if Taiwan
put off talks on reunification for too long.
</P>
<P>
   As ever with Taiwan and China, it is hard to tell which is the
phonier: China's threat of war, or this week's hope for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Chen has gone about as far as any democratically elected
Taiwanese president dares these days in trying to meet China
halfway. This week he repeated his campaign pledge that he will not
declare Taiwan independent _ unless, that is, China turns violent _
nor hold a referendum on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   He proposes to expand the ``three links'' with the mainland,
meaning trade, transport and communications, which his predecessors
had kept under strict control.
</P>
<P>
   And, while he again turned aside the mainland's demand that
``one China'' must be a precondition for the talks China wants him
to engage in, he did offer as a subject for those talks what sort
of place a ``future'' one China might be.
</P>
<P>
   To an outsider that might seem a bridgeable difference, yet
peace is by no means guaranteed. Nor is war. For all their
bellicose behavior in recent months, some of China's leaders also
have reason to want to avoid a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Their oft-proclaimed priority is economic growth. More threats
against Taiwan would have undermined the Clinton administration's
efforts to persuade Congress that China should be granted permanent
normal trading relations as a last step before it joins the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   After fierce lobbying, the vote passed. With luck, that will
serve to bolster the influence of reformers in China, who see
membership of the WTO as the surest way to set about establishing
the rule of law and getting China's flabby economy fit for the long
haul.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is precisely the pull of the future that makes the Taiwan
issue so dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The shock of the election result _ China had previously declared
independent-minded candidate Chen unacceptable and its threats were
designed to frighten voters away from him _ may encourage China to
take a harder look at Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   It will not like what it sees. Thus far China has seemed to
believe its own propaganda, which claims that, bar a few
``splittists,'' 23 million Taiwanese compatriots are yearning for
union with the motherland.
</P>
<P>
   That could scarcely be further from the truth. There may be
little support for outright independence, since that would provoke
China to lash out, but there is precious little for reunification
either.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's is an affluent, energetic young democracy that wants
nothing better than to be allowed to prosper and mind its own
business in peace. China, despite 20 years of economic reform, is
still a Communist Party dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   As the economic going has grown more difficult, and the appeal
of Marx has been lost to the lure of the marketplace, the party's
bosses have encouraged a visceral nationalism as a means to justify
their continuing hold on power. Free, democratic and well-heeled
Taiwan poses a threat to their rule.
</P>
<P>
   In the approach to the next party congress in 2002, the battle
will intensify between those who want to build an economically
stronger China and those who prefer a still socialist China with
nationalist characteristics. Policy towards Taiwan may well be
dragged further into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Taiwan faces two more immediate dangers. One is that
Chen's conciliatory tone this week will be mistaken by hard-liners,
including some in China's armed forces, as proof that, despite the
unwanted election result, their threats have worked, and that more
threats would work even better.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Chen dropped his aim of independence because
Taiwan's voters did not care for it, not because it offended China.
</P>
<P>
   The harder China now tries to lean on Taiwan, the harder it will
be for Chen to stretch a hand across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   The other danger is that others will lose interest now that talk
of war has subsided. Outsiders cannot mediate between China and
Taiwan, which must decide for themselves if China is one country
with two systems, as the Chinese insist, or one nation embracing
two states, as the Taiwanese might accept.
</P>
<P>
   They can, however, help to avoid misunderstandings. Americans,
Japanese and Europeans with an interest in Asia's stability need to
remind China that threats of force are unacceptable, and that force
itself would not go unanswered. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Rudy who?
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's out of the Senate race, nobody in New York wants
to know about Rudolph Giuliani. The new man of the moment is Rick
Lazio, a congressman hitherto largely unheard of outside Long
Island who will now be Hillary Rodham Clinton's opponent.
</P>
<P>
   A clean-cut youthful fellow who has niceness written all over
his beaming face, he looks like the sort of opponent the
increasingly impressive Mrs. Clinton will eat for breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder some Republicans, dismayed by the withdrawal of the
bare-knuckle-fighting Giuliani, talk of the first lady having,
perhaps literally, the luck of the devil.
</P>
<P>
   They should not be so downcast. Lazio may have a better chance
of slaying the demon than Giuliani. For a start, Lazio will pick up
a ton of votes for the simple reason that he is not Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   Some psephologists reckon that Mrs. Clinton has so many
negatives that if the Republicans nominated a bag of bagels it
would poll 30 percent against her. Exactly why is hard to pin down
precisely.
</P>
<P>
   Being a ``carpetbagger'' from out of state has something to do
with it (helpfully, Lazio was born and bred in New York.)
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Clinton also seems to have a gift for grating with her
natural supporters. Some successful female professionals resent the
way that she has risen on her husband's coattails whilst presenting
herself as a career woman.
</P>
<P>
   Others criticize her for standing by her man despite being
publicly humiliated by his sexual antics. Manhattan liberals will
bad-mouth her as a hypocrite who presents herself as a saintly,
selfless, caring figure, when in fact all she cares about is her
own political advancement.
</P>
<P>
   And those are the views of sympathetic moderates. Best not to
get a Republican activist started on the Whitewater scandal or the
suicide of Mrs. Clinton's very good friend, Vince Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio can also count on the many Hillary-haters outside New
York, who stumped up a fortune for Rudy's campaign, and _ even if
Giuliani exercises his right to keep that cash for some future
campaign of his own _ are likely to do the same for his successor
in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's inflammatory fund-raising letters allowed Mrs.
Clinton to paint him as part of some right-wing conspiracy. With a
little subtlety, Lazio should be able to win the same support,
without ruining his reputation for being likeable _ a
characteristic even black Democratic congressmen from New York
happily affirm.
</P>
<P>
   This points to another potential advantage: as well as not being
Hillary, Lazio is not Rudy.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, like his erstwhile opponent, was terribly unpopular
with a large chunk of the electorate. He so antagonized New York's
blacks, particularly by his forceful defense of the police after
they shot three unarmed men, that he might have provoked a record
turnout of ethnic minority voters.
</P>
<P>
   Even if few of them will now switch to support Lazio, far fewer
will feel provoked to turn out to vote against him.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to his support of the death penalty and apparently
straightforward personal life, Lazio can also count on the support
of New York's small Conservative Party, which opposed Giuliani, who
offered neither.
</P>
<P>
   In 26 years, no Republican has won statewide office without
Conservative backing. And, unlike Giuliani, who loves nothing more
than being mayor of New York City, Lazio really wants to be a
senator, and has the commitment, time and energy to mount a
campaign to match the exhaustingly vigorous one of Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio will not share the mayor's reluctance to campaign upstate,
particularly when the Yankees are playing _ a mistake which allowed
Mrs. Clinton to win support in the Republican heartlands.
</P>
<P>
   Not being Rudy certainly has some drawbacks too. He loses the
support of the tiny Liberal Party. And Lazio does not have
Giuliani's hard-won reputation as the man who restored law and
order to the city that never sleeps.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, New Yorkers seemed profoundly ungrateful on
this score. If the newly nice Giuliani campaigns for Lazio
energetically enough, some law-and-order Democrats may see a vote
for Lazio as a way of thanking Giuliani without having to tolerate
him in their face.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Lazio's own record. By most standards he has been an
effective sort in Washington (in fact he might prove a better
senatorial politicker than either Giuliani or Mrs. Clinton).
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has already branded him a ``Newt Gingrich
conservative'' _ a good tactic in a state where Democrats outnumber
Republicans. But Lazio stands by his support for the unmissed
Gingrich's ill-fated ``Contract with America,'' especially its
promised balanced budget, tax relief for working families and
strong defense. ``What is it exactly they don't like?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Lazio does not match the usual unpalatable Gingrich
stereotype. He has voted for bills protecting the environment,
subsidizing health care for the working disabled and securing
low-rent housing for the poor. He is broadly pro-choice, though he
opposes ``partial-birth'' abortion.
</P>
<P>
   He prefers being liked to being provocative. And he can press
the ``I feel your pain'' buttons at least as well as Mrs. Clinton.
He can impress Jewish groups with his hard work for the
repatriation of Holocaust assets.
</P>
<P>
   With his photogenic wife and young kids frequently by his side,
he will certainly match the first lady platitude for platitude on
the importance of the family and how children matter.
</P>
<P>
   Having prepared herself for a celebrity personality contest,
Mrs. Clinton may now have to talk far more about issues. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 925, OR CONTINUE TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Five years ago, another likeable but unknown moderate
Republican, Governor George Pataki, dethroned New York's main
political celebrity, Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani was still running, senior Republicans fretted that
the clash of egos allowed Mrs. Clinton to hide her big-government
beliefs _ beliefs that are probably unpopular with the key suburban
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Now they hope that Lazio can flush out the real Hillary. That
strategy in turn relies on two things: the untested Lazio managing
to avoid making gaffes; and Mrs. Clinton not changing her
definition of the ``real Hillary'' yet again.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio is in with a chance, but she starts in front _ and who
would have thought that possible even three months ago? &QL;

<P>
   AUSTIN AND LOS ANGELES _ Ricky Martin's hips and Jennifer
Lopez's haunches have done more to raise temperatures around
America this past year than global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Popular culture embraces all things Latino, from callipygian pop
stars to taco-touting chihuahuas.
</P>
<P>
   Given all that, it was inevitable that Latinos would become a
politically powerful group. Whether they are an interest group is
another matter, and depends on where you sit. The two main
political parties certainly believe they are a block to be wooed
and won.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos themselves are less sure about it. They have seldom
played the ethnic card in politics, not least because they are a
heterogeneous lot united mostly by language.
</P>
<P>
   Like most voters, their interests stem mostly from where they
live and how much money they make, not from their skin or culture.
</P>
<P>
   The oddity of their position becomes clear by contrast with the
pressure groups around them. Most of these _ from the National
Rifle Association to the teachers' unions _ derive their power from
organization, money, loyalty and a clear agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos retain a hold over the Democratic Party without any of
these things. They give precious little money, and vote relatively
seldom; virtually every senior Democrat entertains some doubts
about their long-term loyalty, and their agenda is still relatively
vague.
</P>
<P>
   The result: things are offered almost before they are demanded.
So far, it seems to be working.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats got around 70 percent of the Latino vote in the
1996 election. President Bill Clinton even managed to win 65
percent of Latinos earning more than $75,000 a year. Virtually all
the elected Latinos outside Miami are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The few Latino organizations that exist tend to have a
Democratic bias, though they are far less active than black
political groups. The arrival of Latinos has helped swing several
congressional seats to the party.
</P>
<P>
   So why pay so much attention? One reason is demographics. The 32
million Latinos in the United States make up 11.7 percent of its
population. Soon Latinos, whose numbers have swelled by a third
since 1990, will overtake blacks to be America's largest minority.
</P>
<P>
   Around a third of the Latinos are not yet citizens of the United
States, and of those who are, 40 percent are too young to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Even among those eligible to vote, registration still lags, so
that Latinos cast only 5 percent of the votes in the 1996 election
(up from 3.7 percent in 1992), and are expected to cast about 7
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is fear. Democrats remember the swing to Ronald
Reagan in 1980 among traditionally Democratic Irish, Italian and
Polish Roman Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are fond of saying that Latinos are ``natural
Republicans'' on the strength of their religiously-based social
conservatism. They have done little so far to awaken them
nationally to their supposed nature, although there are some large
pockets of achievement.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has regularly picked up 40 percent of the Latino
vote as the group's choice of presidential candidate, thanks to his
rapport with them in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   His governor-brother Jeb, a fluent Spanish-speaker with a
Mexican wife, does even better among Latinos in Florida with a
potent blend of social conservatism and concern for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Parties usually deal with interest groups by giving them what
they want in exchange for money and votes. The problem with Latinos
is that their interests do not make up a coherent set of demands.
As a result, recent attempts by Democrats to shore up their support
among Latinos have had a hit-and-miss feel.
</P>
<P>
   When Al Gore, who from time to time breaks into patchy Spanish,
jumped into the argument over Elian Gonzalez in a bid to appeal to
Florida's Cuban-Americans, he did himself harm with Latinos
elsewhere, who favored returning the boy to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The nearest thing to an issue among Latinos is their support for
liberal immigration policies. The most spectacular evidence of this
is the disastrous damage the Republican Party did to itself in
California in 1994 with its support of Proposition 187.
</P>
<P>
   This ballot measure, which passed into law, withdrew social
services from illegal immigrants in the state, the bulk of whom
were Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   The support the measure received from Pete Wilson, then the
Republican governor of California, helped to sink the party in the
polls, leaving all the senior offices in California today in
Democratic hands. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 750, OR CONTINUE TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bush does not talk much about Wilson. The Democrats assiduously
exploit the issue. Gore's announcement in March that the
administration is proposing an amnesty for immigrants who came
illegally to America before 1986 got wide coverage in the
Spanish-language media.
</P>
<P>
   Leading Democrats also successfully lobbied the AFL-CIO to
change its policy on immigration. The trade-union movement, until
recently narrow-eyed about foreigners of any sort taking its
members' jobs, has now become much more sympathetic to Latinos, who
make up an increasing number of those members.
</P>
<P>
   A much-publicized strike by caretakers in Los Angeles is led by
a union almost entirely composed of recent Latino immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue that is looming large on the Latino agenda is the
U.S. census.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, alongside
the Democrats but not the Republicans, has lobbied for having a
statistically estimated adjustment in the census, to take account
of the many poor, migrant, homeless and illegal people whom the
census may miss.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to boost the number of congressional seats for
Latino areas. The parties' positions are a mark of everyone's
confidence that such seats will be won by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Garcia, a political scientist at the University of New
Mexico, argues that Latino votes will depend most heavily on health
care, education and welfare services.
</P>
<P>
   All are traditional Democratic issues, but in concentrating on
them Latinos are following the pattern of earlier immigrants: they
are adopting middle-class American patterns of political behavior,
rather than putting their ethnic identity above everything else.
And this is the way they have always behaved.
</P>
<P>
   In political terms, this special-interest group is neither
special, nor one interest. That will be the Republicans'
opportunity. &QL;

<P>
   LITTLE ROCK _ It's a strange thing about Arkansas: the state
that propelled Bill Clinton to the peak of politics also produces
the people who do him most damage.
</P>
<P>
   First Cliff Jackson, the tireless Whitewater digger; then Paula
Jones; and now the state's lawyer-discipline committee which, on
May 22, started proceedings to disbar President Clinton from
practicing law in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   This was quite an eye-opener in a state with a reputation for
sweeping such matters under the carpet.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it reflects two things _ the obduracy of Clinton's
opponents (not least, Kenneth Starr and Jones); and the fact that
the Arkansas bar takes itself much more seriously than outsiders
might expect.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may become the first sitting chief executive of the
United States to lose his law license. His fate now rests in the
hands of a randomly-selected circuit court judge in Little Rock and
the state Supreme Court; both must uphold the panel's
recommendation for disbarment, which could take a few months, or
several years.
</P>
<P>
   The disbarment action was prompted, first, by a filing with the
committee in September 1998 by a conservative legal foundation, and
then by an April 1999 referral from District Judge Susan Webber
Wright of Little Rock, who oversaw the Paula Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy enough for Clinton to dismiss the first filing as the
work of the inevitable vast right-wing conspiracy. But Judge
Wright, who dismissed Jones's complaint, is another matter. She was
particularly offended by Clinton's apparent attempts to mislead the
jury about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In Arkansas, the bar is considered an institution of dignity:
``shyster behavior,'' as one member puts it, is not easily
tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   The rules say disbarment is an appropriate punishment for
``serious misconduct,'' including ``dishonesty, deceit, fraud, or
misrepresentation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas Supreme Court itself has ruled, in another
disbarment hearing, that ``lawyers holding public office assume
legal responsibilities going beyond that of other citizens.'' Lying
is particularly frowned upon.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these strictures need a pinch of salt. Taken literally,
they suggest that being a lawyer is incompatible with political
success of even the lowest sort.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee can bite. Five to ten lawyers come before the
bar each year for misbehaving, and most voluntarily surrender their
licenses.
</P>
<P>
   If disbarred, Clinton would find himself in relatively familiar
company. To begin with, there are all his friends that Kenneth
Starr has rounded up.
</P>
<P>
   Seven lawyers, including another former governor of Arkansas,
Jim Guy Tucker, face the loss of their licenses because of the
Whitewater investigation. And there are also a fair number of
political types.
</P>
<P>
   One former Democrat state senator of 29 years' standing, Nick
Wilson, resigned at the end of last year rather than face
disbarment proceedings for racketeering. Another recent casualty
was John Arens, the Arkansas chairman of Ross Perot's 1992
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In his keenness to fight the charges in court, Clinton is in
more select company. Last year, P.A. ``Les'' Hollingsworth, a
well-known Little Rock lawyer, lost his case with the Arkansas
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also insisting that he will not take the stand while
in office, something that may count against him.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that normal Americans would much rather forget about
legal Clintonia of any sort. But Clinton's fate is now in the hands
of Arkansan lawyers, some of whom see Clinton's possible disbarment
as a chance to clean up the state's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   One early sign of this new thirst for probity is the fact that
eight members of the committee on professional conduct have already
excused themselves in the name of unbiased justice.
</P>
<P>
   A judge, who was removed from the bench earlier this month for
practicing law on the side, illegally switching license plates and
writing 59 bad checks, was up for election this week; the newly
moralistic voters of Arkansas turfed him out. &QL;

<P>
   AUSTIN _ The Rio Grande, which forms an 800-mile border between
the United States and Mexico, is usually shown as an ankle-deep
flow with lots of immigrants in it. But it does contain a fair
amount of water, which is often the only drinkable source for miles
around.
</P>
<P>
   Under a treaty of 1944, Mexico is meant to give Texas access to
at least 350,000 acre-feet of water each year from the river and
its tributaries. Now Mexico has fallen so far behind in its
promised deliveries that it owes the United States more than 1
million acre-feet.
</P>
<P>
   According to gasping Texan farmers, the trouble began in 1992,
when the Mexican government started hoarding water during a
regional drought. In a parched region, water-hoarding is a high
crime, especially when it allows Mexico to grow crops for export
that compete with America's.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials reply that the drought counts as an
``extraordinary'' exception under the treaty, and they are still in
a bad way.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Mexico, rainfall has been below average for the past
six years. The reservoirs are so low that they can barely supply
the needs of some northern Mexican cities, and production of maize
(for tortillas, the pillar of the Mexican diet) has dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Texan officials question the treaty's vague use of
``extraordinary.'' Meanwhile, as Mexico fails to make its water
deliveries, Texan farmers suffer.
</P>
<P>
   One study, by a consortium of businesses from the Lower Rio
Grande Valley, shows that farmers are losing about $400 million a
year because of Mexico's water debt to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   One underlying cause of the water war is explosive growth. Since
the signing of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA),
foreign direct investment has poured into the region.
</P>
<P>
   The border population _ at present about 6.4 million on the
United States side and 5.6 million on the Mexican side _ is
expected to jump to 24 million by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   But, as in California, another problem is wasteful practice.
Farmers soak up about 85 percent of the border region's scarce
water, and on the semi-arid land on both sides they grow thirsty
cash crops like sugar cane.
</P>
<P>
   An ancient system of water rights means that many farmers pay
only modest amounts to obtain their annual allocations from the Rio
Grande, and poor pipelines and irrigation systems allow lots of
water to leak out.
</P>
<P>
   The United States government is now demanding that Mexico make a
good-faith effort to deliver the water owed for the current year as
well as a small part of the accumulated shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   By Oct. 2, it hopes to have wrung at least 400,000 acre-feet out
of its neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   As a gesture of goodwill, Mexico has transferred to American
ownership a total of 138,000 acre-feet of water in the Amistad and
Falcon international dams. And it has promised to give Texas all it
owes since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But when will it do so? That depends on the rain; and Texas
weathermen see few clouds coming for a very long time. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Until recently, Serbia was an authoritarian state.
Its citizens were kept in check by a powerful security police and
by heavy state control over their economic affairs _ in such
matters as jobs, housing and financial transactions _ while still
enjoying the outward forms of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia was not totalitarian. Disorderly but lively opposition
parties, as well as independent media outlets, were tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   But that distinction may disappear, as Yugoslavia's President
Slobodan Milosevic girds himself for what could be his last battle.
</P>
<P>
   This time he is not fighting other ethnic groups, but fellow
Serbs whose anger over the country's isolation and poverty is
reaching the point of no return.
</P>
<P>
   To judge by the mounting repression _ the closure of television
and radio stations, scores of arrests, and threats to introduce an
``anti-terrorism law'' that would mean something like emergency
rule _ Milosevic may be reaching that point too.
</P>
<P>
   By closing the airwaves to the opposition, he is taking the risk
that popular discontent may boil over. Yet he, and the toughest
parts of his coalition, apparently calculate that the anger already
in evidence may sweep them away unless they crack down hard.
</P>
<P>
   To a degree that dismays even the president's own Socialist
supporters, rivals in the Yugoslav Left party _ run by his powerful
wife, Mira Markovic, and the ultranationalist Radicals headed by
Vojislav Seselj _ are gaining prominence as their calls for the
suppression of pro-western ``traitors'' grow more strident.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, meanwhile, has called a fresh street
demonstration for May 27. Provincial towns like Kragujevac, Nis and
Cacak are seething with discontent, and threaten to displace
Belgrade and multiethnic Novi Sad as the main bastions of dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Kouchner, the Frenchman who runs Kosovo for the United
Nations, this week described the regime in Belgrade as a ``fascist
island in the Balkans, counting its last days.''
</P>
<P>
   If his language sounded strong, it was because he was trying to
parry the anger that has swept through the province's
ethnic-Albanian majority since 143 Kosovars were jailed last week
for ``terrorism'' by a court in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why Milosevic feels he has nothing to lose by
raising the stakes. Neither he nor his most trusted lieutenants can
travel to any western country for fear of being arrested on
war-crimes charges.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls suggest that only about a fifth of Serbia's
voters, many of them old-age pensioners, want to keep Milosevic in
charge.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, his government is facing an opposition
movement that is not tainted, in the public's mind, with the
perceived failings of the regime's other opponents: power-seeking
vanity and a compulsive tendency to quarrel.
</P>
<P>
   The loosely structured movement known as Otpor, or Resistance,
is made up of young people, many of them students, who seem
desperate enough to risk their skulls to fight a regime that is
blocking their future.
</P>
<P>
   Though state propaganda portrays them as agents of the wicked
western powers that bombed Serbia last year, the charge carries
little credibility.
</P>
<P>
   As for the older opposition parties, public skepticism about
them may have grown since May 17, when the authorities abruptly
turned the screw by shutting down Studio B, the main independent
television channel, and two radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   The 30,000 or so people who turned up to denounce the closure,
and were beaten up by the police, later got little moral support
from the politicians who had been addressing them.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Vuk Draskovic, the best-known opposition leader,
was in Montenegro, where a standoff continues between westernizers,
who dream of detaching the republic from Serbia, and politicians
loyal to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Tension could reach a breaking point after local elections on
June 11, when the pro-Serbian opposition will mount a challenge to
President Milo Djukanovic.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he has been artful enough to broaden links with the rest
of the world _ including the European Union and his Croatian and
Albanian neighbors _ while keeping at bay the threat of a coup by
the local Yugoslav garrison to reassert the authority of the
government in Belgrade. But that government would not miss an
opportunity to meddle if it saw one.
</P>
<P>
   The scale and the limits of Milosevic's unceasing campaign to
destabilize neighboring countries were highlighted this weekat a
conference in Brussels on the reconstruction of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, for those who still seek to build a multiethnic
Bosnia, is that the Serb nationalists are failing to keep their
ethnic cousins, who control 49 percent of Bosnia's territory,
hermetically sealed from the Muslims and Croats who run the
remainder.
</P>
<P>
   Movement across the ``inter-entity boundary'' that separates the
two halves of Bosnia has never been so free since the peace
agreement signed in Dayton came into force in 1996. It called for a
sort of ``soft partition'' followed by gradual integration.
</P>
<P>
   Another good omen for Bosnia's international protectors is that
the number of people reclaiming their old homes, in areas now
controlled by a rival ethnic group, has doubled in each of the past
four years. This year it could reach as many as 160,000.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the claimants are Muslims returning to parts of eastern
Bosnia from which they were ejected in 1992, or Serbs who had fled
from Sarajevo or points west. In the north Bosnian town of Doboj, a
bastion of Serb chauvinism, a Muslim jeweller is once again doing a
roaring trade.
</P>
<P>
   The grimmer news is that Bosnia's federal institutions remain
weak and their leadership poor. The bad old days of bloodily
unbridled nationalism could return all too quickly if Bosnia ceased
to be kept under close supervision; the ramshackle republic's
internal equilibrium is still vulnerable to mischief stirred up
from within or without.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia's Croat politicians, at least, have grown more amenable _
about letting displaced Muslims come home, for example _ since
their nationalist sponsors in Zagreb lost power to a more liberal
government. But the Bosnian Serbs may still be tempted by
chauvinism as long as that cause is championed in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   An even harder test for international bureaucrats _ and equally
crucial to their campaign to show that they, not Milosevic, are
calling the shots _ will be the effort to woo displaced Serbs back
to Kosovo in decent numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. refugee agency this week gave its most precise estimate
so far of the number of non-Albanians who fled the province after
NATO marched in last year: about 180,000 went to Serbia proper, and
30,000 to Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   The more of these people (mostly Serbs) who can be persuaded to
return to Kosovo, the more credibility will be enjoyed by Bishop
Artemije, the Kosovo Serbs' moderate leader, who has defied local
hard-liners, and enraged the government in Belgrade, by cautiously
agreeing to cooperate with the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be few returns unless ethnic Albanians can be
dissuaded more forcefully from taking revenge.
</P>
<P>
   As power struggles among the Serbs _ in Belgrade, Pristina
(Kosovo's capital) and elsewhere _ become more desperate, the
outcome will be influenced not only by western pressure but by
Russia's new administration, which has sent mixed messages to its
traditional Balkan friends. &QL;

<P>
   The first signals from President Vladimir Putin, after his
election in March, boded ill for Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Russia appeared to be slowing down on gas deliveries to Serbia,
as well as military cooperation, and pressing the Serb leader to be
more flexible over Kosovo. But this month's visit to Moscow by the
Yugoslav defense minister, and the announcement of a $100 million
Russian loan for Serbia, suggested that its rulers still have
powerful friends in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   So, however, does the Serbian opposition; at any rate, Draskovic
and other anti-Milosevic politicians are due in Moscow next week.
</P>
<P>
   When Putin holds his first summit meeting with President Bill
Clinton on June 4, both sides will be conscious that Russia could
be very helpful _ or unhelpful _ in what could turn out to be the
Yugoslav endgame. &QL;

<P>
   ALMATY _ Listen to the talk of huge oil discoveries off the
coast of Kazakhstan, and you might think that this impoverished
country is about to turn into a Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it will, but it is too early to be sure. For months, the
people of Kazakhstan have been hopefully watching the Kashagan oil
field, the first in the country's bit of the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Oil has been found beneath parts of the sea controlled by Russia
and Azerbaijan. So it was not so unreasonable to expect a big field
on the other side in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   The government talked of finding at least 1 billion tons of oil,
a sizeable deposit, but a report attributed to American government
sources suggests that the area may contain as much as 6.8 billion
tons.
</P>
<P>
   If the claim turns out to be true, it would be the biggest oil
find anywhere in the world for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Kazakhstan's president, Nursultan Nazarbaev, is
talking of cranking out as much oil as Saudi Arabia, the world's
biggest oil producer, by 2015.
</P>
<P>
   If Kashagan turns out to be a real gusher, it will have a big
effect on the pipeline politics that have bedevilled the region.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been scheming to prevent Central Asia's
as-yet-untapped oil and gas riches from reaching the market via
Russia and Iran. Better, say the Americans, that the stuff should
flow westward via the relative safety of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia and Iran happen to be giant neighbors that the poor
Central Asian states have to live with, and which offer reasonably
cheap access to world markets.
</P>
<P>
   To tempt countries such as Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, which also
has visions of oil-fired prosperity, the Americans have been
promoting a rival route for Caspian oil. They would like to see it
flow from Baku, on the coast of Azerbaijan, west to the safe
Turkish port of Ceyhan.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, the Americans have won only reluctant
commitments from the multinationals involved, among them Britain's
BP Amoco, which heads the main Azerbaijani oil consortium.
</P>
<P>
   Kazakhstan's oil would reach Baku either by tanker or, less
likely, through a possible underwater pipeline. One difficulty is
the estimated $2.4 billion it would cost for the 1,730-km
(1,075-mile) tube through which the oil would travel. A bigger
problem is that at present there is simply not enough oil to fill
it.
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijan, where drilling is more advanced than in Kazakhstan,
has so far disappointed oilmen by yielding up mostly natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Matzke of Chevron puts it bluntly: ``There isn't any oil
looking for a transportation system. Most pipelines are built after
the demand, rather than before the demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but if the new finds in Kazakhstan turn out to be as big as
expected, say boosters of the Americans' plan, then their pipeline
is back in business.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. One reason it may not be is timing: the hoped-for oil
from Kazakhstan's fields will not start flowing in serious
quantities until 2008, but America wants the companies to complete
the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is possible competition from Iran. Getting oil to the
Gulf would be much cheaper than getting it to Turkey. In time,
argue fans of an Iranian route, America's hostility to business
dealings with Iran's thuggish regime will fade. But that could take
a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, companies that have tried to do business with the
mullahs report that bureaucratic wrangling and other difficulties
greatly raise the costs and risks of the Iranian option.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the only sure winner from any oil bonanza in
Kazakhstan is Russia. A fair amount of oil already crosses
Kazakhstan through a pipeline from Atyrau, in the west of the
country. A new pipeline is expected by 2001 that will transport oil
to the Russian port of Novorossiysk.
</P>
<P>
   The only other ways that Kazakhstan's oil gets to market now,
via rail and tanker, also often rely on the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Russia has lots of new ideas to suck up
Caspian oil, and so earn the fat transit fees. If Kazakhstan's oil
finds turn out to meet the latest giddy expectations, all the rival
pipeline schemes may find themselves in business.
</P>
<P>
   What are the chances of that? Nobody really knows. The leaks
from American officials are probably self-serving attempts to keep
their troubled project afloat.
</P>
<P>
   The euphoria of Kazakhstan's officials is likely to be equally
baseless, if less surprising.
</P>
<P>
   The only people who may really know are those in the companies
actually doing the drilling at Kashagan. All they will say, at the
moment, is that their results are ``very encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Their final report, which is due in two or three months' time,
is eagerly awaited. Pipeline punters near and, especially, far will
be holding their breath. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anybody surprised by the hostile reaction to the bid
on May 24 by UAL, operator of United Airlines, for US Airways must
not fly much.
</P>
<P>
   In the two decades since the American industry was deregulated,
it has seen wild expansion, with more than 100 new carriers
launched in the 1980s, followed by equally manic consolidation,
with more than 100 failures and takeovers in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, the one constant was poor service and high prices:
business travellers to some destinations, such as Houston, Texas,
still pay fares that could take them around the world on
international airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the airlines have continued to lose money. As
recently as 1995, after years of mergers and cost-cutting, the
cumulative earnings of the industry over its entire history were
still negative.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder regulators, investors, employees and passengers all
doubt the wisdom of another large acquisition. Shares in UAL fell
by as much as 15 percent after the merger was announced.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, what United wants to do appears to make some
sense. Although it is the world's largest airline, it is not strong
everywhere. Domestically, its routes tend to go east-west, mostly
longer trips.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways, the country's sixth-largest carrier, specializes in
shorter trips, especially north-south on the two coasts. It is
strong in the northeast, where United is weak.
</P>
<P>
   United wants US Airways to broaden its services nationally,
along with increasing its economies of scale. For this United is
offering to pay more than a 100 percent premium on US Airway's
share price, for a total deal value of $11.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But history shows just how hard it is to realize such apparent
advantages. For one thing, it is hard to get a deal done.
</P>
<P>
   When United and US Airways last tried to wed, in 1995, the
carriers' powerful pilot unions blocked them. The pilots have said
they oppose the new deal, too.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust authorities are another barrier. The Department of
Justice's trustbusters, who say the airline industry is their
biggest concern after Microsoft, are suing to block a partial
merger between Northwest and Continental Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   And, even when mergers take place, they often stumble over
combining routes, computer systems and cultures. US Airways lost
money for nearly a decade after buying Piedmont in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the deal can be done, there is good reason to question
whether it should be. Whatever efficiencies there may be in
mergers, they rarely result in savings for fliers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, bigger carriers tend to have more weight to throw
around, locking up landing slots at hubs, offering incentives to
travel agents for preferential bookings and temporarily slashing
prices to fend off competitors (the U.S. Department of Justice is
suing American Airlines for allegedly doing just that).
</P>
<P>
   A study last year by the congressional General Accounting Office
concluded that, between mergers and alliances, two-thirds of
American travellers will soon fly to markets dominated by a single
airline.
</P>
<P>
   This concentration is already harmful. Since 1994 domestic
prices, measured in cents per passenger mile, have steadily risen,
even as fuel costs were falling.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the newfound profitability of the industry is mostly
explained by the failure of airlines to pass the fuel savings on to
the customers, which suggests a lack of effective price
competition.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a problem unique to America: airline markets
everywhere remain bastions of monopoly. But in the age of Internet
travel auctions and online pricing, the cost of the industry's
inefficiencies has never been more glaring.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this latest merger goes through or not, the greatest
consumer benefit may come from the antitrust scrutiny that the deal
will inevitably bring. &QL;

<P>
   SYDNEY _ The Sydney Harbor Bridge, one of the city's two grand
symbols, will be closed to cars on May 28 for only the third time
since it was built 68 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as many as 250,000 people will take over the bridge in a
walk to mark reconciliation with Australia's aborigines.
</P>
<P>
   The ``people's walk'' will follow a ceremony the previous day at
the opera house, Sydney's other great symbol, where aboriginal
leaders will hand to the Australian government a document that
calls for a national apology over injustices to indigenous people
and recognition of their customary laws.
</P>
<P>
   Both events are meant to mark a high point in Australia's
attempts to make symbolic amends with its indigenous people 212
years after the British invaded or settled the country, depending
on how you look at it.
</P>
<P>
   But under the government of John Howard, reconciliation has
become mired in politics. Howard refuses to make an apology. He
maintains Australians should not be held to account for the
misdeeds of previous generations.
</P>
<P>
   Reconciliation, he says, should involve practical measures, like
giving money to help lift aborigines' deplorable health standards
and put more of them into schools and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's record in this regard is not bright. Death rates for
aborigines from all causes are twice as high as those for Maoris in
New Zealand; they compare badly with those for indigenous Americans
and are more than three times the total Australian rate, according
to Gustav Nossal, the deputy chairman of the Council for Aboriginal
Reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian Parliament started the reconciliation process in
1991, and aimed at achieving it by 2001, the centenary of the
country's federation. Howard committed himself to this goal
``genuinely,'' as he put it, on his re-election in 1998. But his
actions since then have made some critics wonder how serious he is.
</P>
<P>
   In February, he abandoned the 2001 deadline, saying it had been
a mistake. Then his government attacked a U.N. committee that had
criticized the way mandatory sentencing laws in the Northern
Territory and the state of Western Australia had led to the jailing
of mainly unemployed, black youths.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations disapproved of the Howard government's
refusal to override these laws, as it has the power to do.
</P>
<P>
   The government's most controversial stand has been towards one
of the most painful episodes of Australia's recent past. This
involves the tens of thousands of mixed-race children, known as
``the stolen generation,'' who were taken from their parents by
government officials between 1910 and 1970 in the cause of wiping
out their indigenous heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Howard has ignored a recommendation in a 1997 report by
Australia's human-rights and equal-opportunity commission that the
government should formally apologize to the stolen generation.
</P>
<P>
   In April, his government outraged aborigines and many
non-indigenous Australians by claiming that, because only 10
percent of aboriginal children had been involved, the stolen
generation did not really exist.
</P>
<P>
   Howard has also quibbled over the wording of the document that
the members of the reconciliation council will present to him at
the Sydney ceremony. Instead of its call for an apology for past
injustices, he wanted an expression of ``sorrow and profound
regret.''
</P>
<P>
   But the more he has dug in his heels over these symbolic
aspects, the more he has inflamed the aborigines and their
supporters, who include Australia's most influential newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls indicate that 80 percent of Australians support
the aims of reconciliation, but not necessarily an apology.
Whatever they think about that, many Australians are tired of the
divisive politics that have flared around the issue. Howard's
refusal to say sorry could damage his government. &QL;

   YANGON _ Sit down on a stool at a tea stall in Yangon, the
capital of Myanmar, and young men will come to tell you of their
dreams of escape to Europe or America.
</P>
<P>
   Ask them about politics, and in urgent whispers most explain
they cannot answer for fear of arrest. But when the rain falls
noisily a few brave ones dare to speak up: ``It is very bad here,
very bad. Yes, we have rice every day, but we have no jobs. The
government is very bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Such talk, however muted, is particularly risky at the moment:
like the country's innumerable pagoda bells, the junta's nerves are
jangling.
</P>
<P>
   On May 27 ten years ago, the voters unambiguously backed the
National League for Democracy (NLD) in a general election, the
result of which has never been honored. Almost nothing has changed
in the country since then, except its name, which used to be Burma.
</P>
<P>
   A military dictatorship remains in charge. It likes to believe
the election is only a distant memory, but fears that the
anniversary could be the trigger for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Across the border in Thailand, some 90,000 refugees, together
with opposition leaders from Myanmar, will mark the anniversary
with demands for change and international attention. The visit of
Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook, to the border region a few
weeks ago encouraged the refugees and annoyed the junta.
</P>
<P>
   But the Thai government is wary of more violence after
anti-regime fighters from the border region, though not necessarily
from the refugee camps, attacked Myanmar's embassy in Bangkok last
October, and then held a group of hostages in a bloody siege of a
Thai hospital in January.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Myanmar, any demands for change are likely to be rather
less dramatic. Some of the country's 500,000 monks, notably the
younger ones, propose to ``strike,'' but that will merely mean they
reject offerings from army officers and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the military government has been hunting down more
troublesome dissenters. Anyone spotted carrying NLD pamphlets or
stickers has been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The central areas of Yangon are strewn with barbed-wire
barricades. The junta says that any street demonstration will have
been organized by foreign agents, and anyone taking part will be
dealt with severely.
</P>
<P>
   The NLD's leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, is described in the official
newspapers as a ``democracy actress'' and foreign lackey. The
regime claims that increasing numbers of her party have resigned
``willingly and of their own accord.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 19, it says, 470 people left the party in one district of
Yangon, while in March over 120,000 rallied against the
``pessimist'' NLD. Anyone who may have other ideas is warned that
the regime aims to ``crush all internal and external destructive
elements as the common enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Suu Kyi is, of course, one such enemy. Though no longer
under formal house arrest, she remains under close watch by
military intelligence. She is no longer allowed to make public
speeches, though videotaped remarks by her were smuggled out this
week to be broadcast by friendly television and radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   She has called again for a peaceful dialogue with the junta and
for more international pressure for change, especially from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The road to her house is barricaded. Taxi drivers who take
curious foreigners to drive nearby for a snapshot have been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Since she won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, Miss Suu Kyi has
gone a bit out of fashion. Because she speaks like the Oxford
academic's wife she once was, because foreign journalists are
usually smitten by her and because the generals' grip on power
seems stronger than ever, it can be easy to see her as some sort of
western-imposed savior, irrelevant to Myanmar's harsh realities.
</P>
<P>
   That is what the junta would like. Yet she is not. Her western
background and fame are relevant to Myanmar because they make it
hard to lock her up again, or to treat her with the casual cruelty
most ordinary opposition politicians endure.
</P>
<P>
   But Miss Suu Kyi's real importance is as the sole repository of
the hopes for peaceful change harbored by huge numbers of Myanmar's
people.
</P>
<P>
   Although anniversaries are seen as important, the real impetus
for change in Myanmar, peaceful or not, could be economic collapse.
The regime may be fearful that people are beginning to feel they
have less and less to lose. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (250-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Nongovernmental organizations tell of malnutrition in remote
rural areas. The thousands of people who have fled to Thailand have
been driven by desperation for a job as much as by their dislike of
the junta.
</P>
<P>
   The military men claim 10 percent GDP growth a year. But that
figure looks like fantasy and is certainly not reflected in the
value of the currency, the kyat, which is in danger of collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   Shopkeepers who try to stay in business by raising prices are
threatened with arrest. To keep soldiers and government workers
sweet, they were given increases of five or six times their pay
this month, a recipe for more inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The junta is losing its few remaining foreign friends. A
Japanese car company, Toyota, the HSBC bank and a foreign
manufacturer of monosodium glutamate have all announced in the past
few months that they will pull out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Approved foreign investment fell by 90 percent last year and the
only companies set to stay are those exploiting natural resources
such as oil and timber. Even they may be embarrassed by a recent
report by the International Labor Organization condemning the use
of forced labor in army projects, some of which have benefited
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the organization aims to push other United Nations
agencies to distance themselves from the junta until it can prove
that forced labor is no longer used. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Yet Myanmar is not a hopeless case, hardly worth bothering
about. Since so many people are so oppressed by so few, they will
presumably one day do something about it. And, as one side has
nearly all the guns, the result may be bloody. &QL;

<P>
   That is what American entrepreneurs eager to become the next
Cisco or Amazon believe _ and it is why American investors are
putting more cash than ever into venture-capital funds.
</P>
<P>
   As America's innovative economy has become the envy of the
world, so have its venture capitalists. Today, all countries want a
venture-capital industry to turn their garages and bright ideas
into gold. This enthusiasm is mostly welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital allows entrepreneurs to build a firm without
having to borrow and pay high interest charges before they generate
any revenues, let alone profits.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists hand over money in exchange for shares that
may not be worth anything for years, if ever, in the hope that they
will turn out to own a slice of a multibillion-dollar company.
</P>
<P>
   Without venture capital, people with bright ideas would have to
go to a risk-averse bank manager, or fight through the bureaucracy
of an established firm that may be hostile to innovation.
</P>
<P>
   The wet-behind-the-ears youngsters who created Cisco and the
rest could not have done it so fast had their only source of
finance been a bank or a big company _ which is often all that has
been available in Britain, Germany or Japan.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that venture capital works its magic in
isolation. Other things have been essential to American success:
stable, low-inflation macroeconomic policies; labor markets that
make firing and hiring easy; and an entrepreneurial culture in
which people work for little or nothing if they have share options
and in which those who fail are lionized nearly as much as those
who succeed.
</P>
<P>
   But venture capital deserves a slice of the credit for
transforming America's economy from the industrial dinosaur of the
1980s into today's high-growth, high-tech animal. Other countries
are therefore right to seek to foster venture-capital industries of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the venture-capital industry gets bigger and more global,
more may not always prove merrier.
</P>
<P>
   To use the jargon of the new economy, venture capital is not
easily ``scalable.'' Traditionally, it has been a cottage industry.
Small close-knit partnerships each invested a few million dollars a
year, and partners spent much time advising and monitoring managers
as they built a firm into a sustainable business that could be sold
to investors in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists were often a small ``cluster,'' based in
such places as Menlo Park, Calif. Specialisms and reputations were
well-known, so would-be entrepreneurs knew who to go to. The
grapevine ensured that not too many similar companies were
financed.
</P>
<P>
   Now so much money is flooding in that it threatens to drown the
good with the bad. Successful partnerships are placing more, bigger
bets, and have less time for mentoring and monitoring. And this at
a time when problems such as recruiting the right people and
managing growth mean that start-ups need support more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Californian cluster of venture capitalists is now a loose
global network; the large number of near-identical e-retailers
launched in the past two years is evidence that the grapevine no
longer works.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to institutionalize venture capital through
``incubators,'' which aim to take an idea from brain to viable
business in a few weeks by supplying accounting, marketing and
legal advice in exchange for equity, or via publicly traded
venture-capital firms are, at best, unproven _ and will be tested
if the recent sell-off in tech shares continues.
</P>
<P>
   The boom in venture capital reflects the opportunities created
by the Internet. But it also reflects a stock market bubble that
has been particularly pronounced for initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The markets' tumble, which has led to the postponement or
cancellation of many IPOS, may stop venture-capital investors
taking a stock market flotation for granted.
</P>
<P>
   But it is just as likely that, after a short break, the game
will resume as before. That would mean that much of the money
invested in venture capital would continue to be wasted.
</P>
<P>
   Does that matter? Part of the point of venture capital is that,
as in Hollywood, many investments yield no returns _ but those that
do then pay off by the bucketful.
</P>
<P>
   Too much investment in innovation is unlikely to be damaging in
quite the same way as too many buildings or factories. Yet the
venture-capital industry has thrived partly as a disciplined
risk-taking process that put as much emphasis on managing as on
financing.
</P>
<P>
   The wrong lesson for other countries to draw from its success is
that, if you simply throw enough money at new ideas, it will stick.
That was the approach taken by investors in boo.com, the European
sports-goods e-retailer that went bust after frittering away $135
million. Too much fertilizer can sometimes be as bad for a plant as
too little. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ As the trade imbalance between the two blocks
widens, the most serious trade war of all time is surely looming.
</P>
<P>
   America and Japan? No, their trade gap is modest compared with
this. According to official statistics, the whole world is now
running a massive current-account deficit.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that we are importing much more from Mars than we
export to it.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, individual countries' current-account deficits and
surpluses should cancel each other out. But because of statistical
errors and omissions they never do.
</P>
<P>
   Figures from J.P. Morgan show that the world is expected to run
an overall current-account deficit this year of $245 billion,
equivalent to 3 percent of world exports of goods and services _
and that the gap is widening. In 1997, the world had a small
current-account surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the increasing global deficit is, by definition,
unknown. A similar problem emerged in the early 1980s when the
world also had a large current-account deficit with itself. Then
the problem mainly involved investment income: countries were more
scrupulous about recording payments than receipts, so as interest
rates rose sharply the gap swelled.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, the problem seems to relate mainly to
merchandise trade. Since 1997 global imports have been growing much
more quickly than exports. Philip Suttle, an economist at J.P.
Morgan, suggests three possible causes.
</P>
<P>
   The first, ironically, is freer trade. With less red tape it has
become harder for governments to measure trade accurately.
</P>
<P>
   A second reason is the surge in sales over the Internet, which
official number-crunchers find hard to track.
</P>
<P>
   A third could be greater uncertainty about exchange rates since
the 1997 Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   At such times in the past, exporters have understated export
revenues as a way of exporting capital illicitly. The snag with
this theory is that today there are fewer exchange controls that
exporters need to dodge.
</P>
<P>
   Does the world's black hole matter? It might. Since 1997 the
increase in the global discrepancy almost matches the increase in
America's current-account deficit.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, it is possible that the alarming jump in America's
deficit is an illusion caused by mismeasurement of its exports.
Sadly, that seems unlikely. America's Department of Commerce has
put much effort in recent years into improving the quality of its
trade numbers.
</P>
<P>
   It is more likely, suggests Suttle, that the errors lie in the
emerging economies: the current-account deficits of Latin America
or Eastern Europe may be smaller than reported, or Asia's surplus
may be bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Our preferred explanation, however, is that the Martians have
been dumping cheap exports in world markets. And come to think of
it, some of those ``green'' protesters in Seattle last year did
seem rather other-worldly. &QL;

<P>
   MARJAYOUN _ The bearded Hezbollah guerrilla puts down his load
of stolen Israeli grenades and turns to admire the view. Two
hundred meters (650 feet) down the hill, the Israeli workers
building a new defensive position to replace the one he has just
looted have left their bulldozers running and darted for cover.
</P>
<P>
   Just beyond, the odd car skitters about in the Israeli village
of Margaliyot. Farther below, the towns and farms of Galilee
stretch south towards the heart of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``See how they go?'' the guerrilla asks, waving out towards the
country whose soldiers have occupied southern Lebanon for 22 years:
``They leave everything and go like dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the denials of Ehud Barak, Israel's prime minister, his
army certainly seemed to leave Lebanon with its tail between its
legs.
</P>
<P>
   The troops pulled out in such a rush that the air force had to
fly in and blow up all the equipment they left behind. Near Houla,
villagers pointed out a tank left smoldering in the road. Its
occupants, they claimed, had jumped out and fled the last few
hundred meters to Israel on foot. Later, helicopter gunships bombed
the vehicle to stop it falling into Hezbollah's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Travelling in south Lebanon has become even more dangerous since
the evacuation, as hooting Lebanese youths teach themselves to
drive armored vehicles by a process of trial and error.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers who abandoned them were from the South Lebanon Army
(SLA), Israel's proxy militia in Lebanon; they also left impromptu
barricades of Mercedes Benzes and BMWs on the Lebanese side of the
border.
</P>
<P>
   The last stragglers crossed the frontier in the wee hours of May
24, as Israeli fire held back the guerrillas on the hillsides
above.
</P>
<P>
   As the Israeli papers morosely noted, Israel's carefully planned
disengagement from its unpopular and unwinnable war in south
Lebanon had somehow degenerated into a second Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, the withdrawal was always going to be a messy
business. Barak made the pledge to pull out a focal point of his
election campaign last year. But he had hoped to do so as part of a
comprehensive peace agreement with both Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   When talks to that end collapsed, the Lebanese government, egged
on by its allies in Syria, went out of its way to make matters
difficult. It raised extravagant territorial claims, refused to
deploy its army to the evacuated areas, issued veiled threats to
send Palestinian fighters to shoot over the border and allowed the
guerrillas of Hezbollah to harass the retreating troops.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, it was unarmed civilians who prompted the
occupation's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   On May 21, a crowd of Shia Muslim protesters led a march to
retake the village of Qantara, on the fringes of the occupied zone.
The Israeli army had withdrawn from the nearest front-line fort a
week before, leaving a Shia brigade of the SLA to cover their
retreat.
</P>
<P>
   When the demonstration arrived beneath their position, they
simply dropped their guns and gave themselves up to the Lebanese
authorities. Emboldened, the protesters pressed on, walking
unopposed into seven more villages and effectively cutting the
occupation zone in half.
</P>
<P>
   For two more days, the Israeli army and the remains of the SLA
tried to hold back the surge, throwing up hasty barricades and
shooting at people who came too close; seven were killed. But the
Israelis had left too few troops in the enclave to bolster the
faltering SLA.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of three days, over half of the SLA's 2,500
soldiers surrendered to the Lebanese army and Hezbollah, leaving
the Israeli army exposed. Barak had no choice but to order an
immediate pullout. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 625) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Who's in charge now? As good as the guerrillas may be at things
like that, both locals and their neighbors in northern Israel would
like to see a more formal authority take charge. The Israeli
government has pledged to retaliate in force if anyone fires over
the border _ something any one of the thousands of armed and
jubilant men driving along the frontier road could easily do.
</P>
<P>
   The final collapse came too quickly for contractors to complete
the new defensive earthworks and roads they had been building on
the Israeli side of the border. They can resume work now only by
putting themselves in the line of fire.
</P>
<P>
   In places, the hills on the Lebanese side rise so steeply above
the border that a determined guerrilla could jump the fence without
difficulty, or lob a grenade into one of the settlements on the
other side. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,025) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question-mark now hangs over the Shibaa farms, an
agricultural zone straddling the frontier between Lebanon and the
Israeli-occupied portion of Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Lebanese government suddenly claimed the area,
hitherto considered part of Syria. The Syrians, eager to make
trouble for the Israelis, confirmed the story.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearby village of Shibaa, the mayor waves old colonial
deeds which, he says, prove the land belongs to Lebanon. The
frontier was so complicated, he asserts, that different branches of
the same olive tree lay in different countries.
</P>
<P>
   But all the olive groves are firmly in Israeli hands now _ and a
supply route to the Israeli bases on Mount Hermon runs through
them. When it became clear that the Israeli army was withdrawing
from all other occupied territory, the Lebanese government hastily
reiterated its claim. Hezbollah backed it up with an attack on an
Israeli position in the disputed area.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the rest of the former security zone, the state
seems in no hurry to restore its authority. The electricity company
is already laying new connections to the evacuated villages, but
the army has not sent in a single soldier. Instead, the president
has said that Israel cannot expect peace on its northern border
until it allows Palestinian refugees in Lebanon to return home.
</P>
<P>
   Such brinkmanship is unlikely to do much for the Palestinian
cause. But it does risk dragging Lebanon into another conflict with
Israel, only days after the last one ended. &QL;

 &HT;    'GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE' KEEPS BILL BOTTLED UP IN CONGRESS
 &HT;    With GUN-SHOW-LIST. For release Sunday, May 28.
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's a matter of time: the difference between a few
minutes and a few days is a key point in the congressional standoff
on guns.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and gun control advocates want a
waiting period of up to 72 hours to allow background checks on
buyers at gun shows. The National Rifle Association and gun show
operators support an ``instant check'' that can be as quick as
three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides say their position is non-negotiable. And without a
compromise, gun legislation is unlikely to emerge from the
House-Senate conference committee where it has been stuck for
months.
</P>
<P>
   Sherwood Caraway, who runs gun and knife shows throughout
eastern North Carolina, said that for his business, the waiting
period is a matter of survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are going to make a law saying that they have up to
three days to approve the background check,'' Caraway said, ``that
would probably shut the gun shows down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the guy can't come there and pick his gun up and leave with
his gun, it's going to kill the show,'' said Caraway, who has owned
and operated S&AMP;D Promotions for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the checks would drive up the price of guns,
eliminating the main reason people buy at gun shows. With the
72-hour check, many out-of-town vendors would have to pay someone
locally to to deliver the gun once the purchase is approved, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control groups say the fears of gun show operators are a
result of scare tactics by the gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be the end of gun shows. ... They are just
going to be better off at stopping prohibited purchasers from
getting guns,'' said David Bernstein, a spokesman for Handgun
Control Inc., the leading gun-control advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein said that 95 percent of gun-show purchases are
completed in less than two hours, including a background check.
Those who need more time for the check are 20 times more likely to
be disqualified from purchasing a firearm, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people will get their guns in a matter of minutes,'' he
said. ``This affects the people who are most likely to be
criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the 72-hour check also say the instant checks
don't provide enough information and don't allow for a
``cooling-off'' period so people don't buy guns in a moment of
anger.
</P>
<P>
   Under the instant check system, vendors access a national
database to see if the purchaser has a criminal record or other
disqualifying factors.
</P>
<P>
   The 72-hour check would allow time to search local and state
records when necessary. Those records, which contain information
such as domestic violence offenses and mental health records, are
mostly not available on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   If law enforcement can't access records, it ``gives the
potential criminal the benefit of the doubt,'' Bernstein said.
</P>
<P>
   In a January 1999 report, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms estimated that there were more than 4,000 gun shows
nationwide in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The gun shows, usually held in public arenas, civic centers and
fairgrounds, are extremely popular weekend attractions in many
states. Typically, each vendor rents a table from the promoter for
a fee ranging from $5 to $50. The number of tables at shows varies
from 50 to as many as 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Arms Shows, which represents many of
the show promoters, estimates that more than 5 million people
attend gun shows each year, generating billions of dollars in
sales.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, the ATF found that 25 to 50 percent of the
vendors at most gun shows are unlicensed or private dealers. These
dealers are not subject to the Brady Act, which requires the
background checks on the national database.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``gun show loophole'' is the biggest sticking
point in the congressional impasse over tighter gun restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate last year passed a crime bill that included stricter
background checks, as well as requiring safety locks on guns and a
ban on importing large-capacity ammunition clips. The bill would
also bar juveniles with serious criminal records from possessing
guns for life.
</P>
<P>
   A similar House bill did not include the gun provisions, and a
compromise between the two versions has eluded negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, an exchange of letters between the chairman
and the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee hinted at a
possible compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., wrote to Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich.,
informing him he was willing to change the definition of a gun show
to ensure that it would include any event ``used to facilitate the
sale of firearms.'' He also appeared willing to expand the pool of
potential buyers subject to the three-day background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers and other Democrats said that previous compromise plans
offered by Hyde made it too easy for gun sellers to claim they were
not holding a gun show and thus would not be subject to background
checks.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers, in a response to Hyde, commended his willingness to
engage in substantive negotiations on the issue. Closing the gun
show loophole, he said, was ``an exceedingly modest proposition''
that Congress should be able to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   The House-Senate conference committee, put together to resolve
the differences between the two chambers' juvenile justice bills,
has not met since August.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of Congress to move on gun-related legislation was a
major theme of the Million Mom March that drew several hundred
thousand marchers to the Washington Mall on Mother's Day.

 &HT;    CHINESE STUDENTS HOPING OPEN TRADE LEADS TO OPEN RELATIONS WITH

   BEIJING _ As China prepares to join the elite club of global
trading powers, college sophomore Joe Zhou is most excited not by
the unprecedented array of new opportunities that awaits him, but
rather the elevation of China's status in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``China has been developing and improving in the last 10
years,'' he said. ``Now, along with the United States, Japan,
Russia and Europe, it will be one of the five powers of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   While Zhou's generation will likely reap immense benefits from
China's agreement to open up its markets to more foreign
competition than ever before, he and other students interviewed at
the University of Foreign Languages here view accession to the Word
Trade Organization not just as a path towards increased trade and
business, but more broadly, as a way for China to join the global
village.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, China was isolated from the world,'' he said.
``But it's come a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   The passage of a trade bill Wednesday in the U.S. House of
Representatives permanently normalizing trade relations with China
will speed its entry into WTO as well as eliminate the annual
review of its trade status. The latter process has been marked by
scolding and criticisms of just about everything in China, from
religious freedom to workers' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Following the contentious vote, students were glad that yearly
ritual would finally come to end and expressed hope that Chinese
and American people, through increased business and cultural
contacts, would be able to get to know each other better.
</P>
<P>
   ``China and America need communication,'' said Yang Wangping, a
freshman majoring in English. ``The top-level officials
communicate, but we need more at the people-to-people level.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Edmond Zhu said Westerners know very little about
Chinese people and think of them as ``stiff and dull.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese seem dull, he explained, because they're afraid of
getting hassled if they say the wrong thing to a foreigner, so to
play it safe, they keep their conversations benign.
</P>
<P>
   ``But students feel pretty free,'' he said, then proceeded to
scoff at his own government officials to explain why Chinese appear
stiff. ``When you see the foreign ministry spokesperson on TV, he
has no expression. Nothing on his face is moving except for his
lips.''
</P>
<P>
   He hastens to add, though, that the top leaders, such as
President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji, do quite well on
television.
</P>
<P>
   But other televised images of China are too stereotyped, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Hong Kong TV, whenever the foreign programs show China,
it's always Tiananmen Square and a bunch of red flags, as if we're
still in the Cultural Revolution,'' said Zhu, who is majoring in
French.
</P>
<P>
   But the changes in this country of 1.2 billion have been
dramatic since that turbulent decade, when all things foreign were
denounced as capitalist and young people were sent to get an
education not at universities but from peasants in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1978, a couple of years after the Cultural Revolution
officially ended and when the current group of college students was
just starting to come into the world, China's door to the outside
has been opening wider and wider. While it has not torn down all
the walls, change is all this generation has known.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to stand here 20 years ago to interview me, I
don't think I would've dared,'' said Zhou, who is majoring in
Italian. ``Two years ago, E-mail seemed like such a distant thing.
Now, Internet cafes are everywhere. People always ask for your
E-mail address when they want to get in touch with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, all college students were assigned jobs upon
graduation. The University of Foreign Languages was primarily a
feeder school to the ministries of Trade and Foreign Affairs. With
more foreign companies doing business in China, graduates have had
an increasing number of career choices.
</P>
<P>
   Having witnessed such drastic reforms in their short lives, none
regarded entry into the WTO as such a revolutionary event. In fact,
almost to a person, ``inevitable'' was the word they used to
describe it.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, passage of the trade bill giving permanent normalized
trade status to China was seen as a natural development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. Congress changed its path from idealism to
pragmatism,'' said Zhou Zhihua, a junior majoring in Arabic. ``If
it didn't pass, I would've been very surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when it comes to political reforms, they know China does
not act quickly, but nor do other countries, they say. Several
students mentioned slavery in the American South and the long
period it took for black Americans to gain some measure of
equality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't use American standards on an ancient country with
5,000 years of tradition and history,'' said Zhou Zhihua. ``We have
to be patient and tolerant.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, the French major, said he was happy with the pace of
democratization in China. In fact, there are some aspects of
Western democracy he hopes never to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we don't have that kind of campaigning with politicians
making speeches all over the country,'' he said. ``China doesn't
need that.''

whether The Examiner's editorial pages were used to smooth the

alleging that a ``subtle but troubling shift'' occurred in the

   Racing veterans say Ohio's Sarah Fisher is a talented racer at
19
</P>
<P>
   By Tom Archdeacon
</P>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Sarah Fisher was talking about what a difference
a year makes.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, she was a senior at Teays Valley High School,
southwest of Columbus, Ohio. ``Let's face it, I'm not your average
go-to-the-prom girl,'' she said. ``It didn't mean a lot for me to
go to dances, to homecoming and the prom. During high school I went
to one basketball game and just one football game. I raced cars. I
was different. And I wasn't very popular. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said more than that as she made her way through Gasoline
Alley after Thursday's Carburetion Day practice, but her words were
drowned out by a mob of sunburned, beer-fueled fans who were
pressed against a nearby Indianapolis Motor Speedway fence. They
yelled, squealed and screamed support as soon as the diminutive,
pony-tailed 19-year-old came into view.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it is this May. Last year's wallflower has
blossomed big-time at The Brickyard.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher _ who qualified at 220.237 mph _ will start Sunday's
Indianapolis 500 on the inside of Row 7. She is the youngest in the
field of 33 drivers and will be the third youngest _ Josele Garza
was just a few months younger back in 1981 _ ever to start the
world's most famous auto race. Just as historic, she'll become only
the third woman ever to compete in the 500, a race that first was
run in 1911.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while Janet Guthrie (1977-79) and Lyn St. James, who
debuted in 1992 and at age 53, starts in the final row Sunday, came
before her, neither of them ever got the kind of reception Fisher
received. Guthrie was booed by some and both women were merely
tolerated by many. Neither _ because their Indy chance came late in
their careers and always came with inferior race equipment _ was
considered a real race rival by any of the front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   It's different with Fisher. Although she is just 5-foot-2 and
120 pounds, she is the biggest thing to hit Indy this year. She's
being embraced not only by the fans, but by Indy 500 old schoolers
like Al Unser Sr., the taciturn four-time winner who has taken her
under his 60-year old wing and was heard again Thursday gushing,
``She's special.''
</P>
<P>
   As outspoken veteran Eddie Cheever, who won here two years ago
and starts Sunday in Row 4 was saying: ``You can't teach somebody
to be fast. Either they have it or they don't ... and she has it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indy folks are just learning what many people around the
Dayton area have known for a good while. Fisher, a no-nonsense
driver from Commercial Point, has strong ties to the Miami Valley
in every aspect of racing.
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite short track is Eldora Speedway, where she's often
raced. She's competed at Shady Bowl outside DeGraff and last year
set a one-lap record on the treacherous high banks of nearby
Winchester (Ind.) Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Her big break in racing came last October when Huber Heights
businessman and car owner Dale Pelfrey hired her to make her Indy
Racing League debut at the Texas Motor Speedway. Here at Indy _
where she is driving for car owner Derrick Walker, who signed her
to a five-year contract _ one of her sponsors is Mead.
</P>
<P>
   To understand Sarah's spunk _ said Reba, her mom _ you need to
go back three generations to her grandmother, 85-year-old Evelyn
Grindell, who 60 years ago got her pilots license. Reba was racing
go-karts when she met and beat Dave Fisher, the man who would end
up her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah is Dave and Reba's only child and from the start she
showed a precocious streak. She learned to swim before she was one
and could play the piano at age 3. When she was 5 she began racing
quarter-midgets. Three years later she moved to go-karts, where she
won three World Karting Association titles. Dave was racing
go-karts then, too, but he soon found himself in the shadows:
</P>
<P>
   ``I was coming home every night after getting beat and she was
coming home those nights a winner. I said we've got to switch our
thinking here. We've got to put our efforts behind Sarah.''
</P>
<P>
   St. James _ who will be starting her seventh Indy 500 and
finished 11th and won Rookie of the Year honors in 1992 _ likes
what she sees in Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she was 15, Fisher was competing in sprint cars and
last year she had five victories on the midgets circuit. While
racing, she was also a straight-A, National Honor Society student
at Teays Valley. After graduation she had planned to attend Ohio
State and study mechanical engineering, but then Pelfrey made her
an offer she couldn't refuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't ever forget Dale Pelfrey,'' Fisher said Thursday. ``He
gave me my first Indy car ride. He believed in me from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this euphoria is the sobering fact that another 19 year
old race car driver _ the much heralded Adam Petty, grandson of
Richard Petty _ was just killed when his race car hit in a wall
during practice for a NASCAR event in New Hampshire. While both
Sarah and her mom acknowledged the danger involved in this pursuit,
they quickly rationalized their situation and talked about how many
more boys get hurt playing football every year.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Fisher has never seen the Indy 500 in person and has
only watched it on television a couple of times. She has raced just
three IRL events, finishing 25th with Pelfrey last October when the
timing chain in her car broke. She finished 13th at Phoenix earlier
this year and then crashed during the Indy Vegas 300 last month.
</P>
<P>
   In that race she'd worked her way to second place before
spinning in front of Eliseo Salazar. Both cars were knocked out of
the race and the 44-year-old Salazar, who had led the race awhile,
was livid.
</P>
<P>
   In a TV interview after the wreck, he groused: ``This is serious
business out here. This is not powder puff racing.'' He said Fisher
was in over her head and should go back and ``race with girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, never one to get ruffled, was unfazed: ``Yeah, I goofed.
Big deal. I've seen him do the same before.'' She was right.
Salazar _ who later apologized _ does have of a bit of a reckless
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Al Unser Jr. _ the driving mentor for IRL rookies _ quickly
jumped to Fisher's defense: ``She's not in over her head. Not at
all. She responds really well with a car. Any time I've ever sat
down and talked, she listened and then was able to go out and do
what we talked about. She never seems rattled.''
</P>
<P>
   Unser loves her eagerness and curiosity. He also believes she's
``a racer at heart'' _ a compliment like none he's ever given to an
Indy rookie.''
</P>
<P>
   While Unser supports her, veteran Mario Andretti isn't so
flattering: ``Women racers have never proven they can be
competitive. I'm not talking about second or third. Until they win,
they're not a factor. It's that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher had an answer for him, too: ``He's got a point. I mean
there hasn't been a dominant female. With me this isn't a female
issue. I'm not here to make a statement about women. And I won't do
promotions that are exclusively about women. I'm a race car driver
and I'm here to race. And I might just be a kid going into this
right now, but I think its pretty neat. I might be way ahead of
schedule, but right now I pass clean, I hold my own and Sunday I'm
going to drive my heart out. And one day here I'm going to blow the
doors open here.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, she already has.

 &HT;    Come and listen to my story about a man and stray dogs
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ A guy came by my office a while back with a
problem. It was his wife.
</P>
<P>
   This leaves the possibilities wide open, I know. For a fact, if
you are female and were to switch the word ``wife'' and put in
``husband'' the range of problems could stretch forever.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not forever, because this guy's problem was that is
wife was too attractive.
</P>
<P>
   (I wonder how many wives have husbands that are too attractive?
Please, don't all of you speak out at once.)
</P>
<P>
   The guy even showed me a picture of his wife and he was right.
Blonde hair, blue eyes. She could have been a California girl, but
she's really better. She was born in East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   I was having trouble understanding his problem and he launched
into a tale of woe.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that every night his wife goes out walking in an effort
to keep her youthful figure. Her husband doesn't join her because,
truth to tell, even when he was youthful he had no youthful figure.
He never lost his baby fat.
</P>
<P>
   But the woman's youngest son, a teen-ager, does accompany his
mother. Living in the country, it is a pleasant walk almost any
time of the year. The guy told me sometimes mother and son walk
four or five miles a day.
</P>
<P>
   So one day the woman decided to vary the walk. Who could have
known the result? Who could have told the future?
</P>
<P>
   Choosing the road less taken, the woman and her son soon came
upon some figures a distance up the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that?'' the son asked.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long to determine. It was a wild pack of dogs,
ten or more. The woman stopped in her tracks. This could be
serious. Wild dogs in the country can be mean. A whole pack of them
can be absolutely dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The woman decided it was time to turn around. The dogs still
came, of course, baying as they got closer. When they were in plain
sight, the boy picked up a rock and chunked it at the nearest dog.
The dog sniffed the rock, then picked it up. He wanted to play.
</P>
<P>
   Mother and son were relieved to know the dogs weren't dangerous,
but they continued their walk home. Oddly, though they weren't
playing with them, the dogs followed as well.
</P>
<P>
   As she got closer to home the woman tried to shoo them away a
couple of times but it didn't work. They all arrived home en masse.
</P>
<P>
   The hound dogs took up as if they'd always lived there, finding
places on the porch or under trees that made the woman's house look
like the Clampett residence the day before ol' Jed went a-huntin'
for some food. Indeed, besides looking like Elly Mae, the wife
seems to have the same sort of skills with animals.
</P>
<P>
   The woman ordered her son not to feed the dogs a single scrap,
though she couldn't stop him from giving them all names. I think
there were enough dogs to cover all of Santa's reindeer and the
seven dwarfs.
</P>
<P>
   A few times the woman came outside to try to get them to go
away, but they were tired from the walk and it was a pleasant day
just to sun on the porch.
</P>
<P>
   The woman had given up by the time her husband came home with
his truck. There was no way to get the dogs away other than taking
them back where they came from. The dogs willfully got into the
truck _ though they barely fit _ one of them laying his head on the
son's knee as if they'd had a life-long relationship. He took the
dogs back ``home'' and a little beyond.
</P>
<P>
   When he last looked in the rearview mirror, they were simply
standing there, looking for a place to lay down.
</P>
<P>
   So the guy and his wife thought the matter was done. Thought so
until the next morning when they stepped out on the front porch and
saw Donner, Dancer, Dopey, Sneezy, Rudolph and the rest laying
there as if they'd never left. The guy tells me all of them wagged
their tails vigorously when they saw his wife walk outside.
</P>
<P>
   So the guy loaded them in his truck again thinking about, but
ultimately rejecting, a suggestion by his son to put a tiny
blindfold over each dog's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Again they went down winding country roads, again they dropped
them off where they'd originally came from. Again, the guy doesn't
have much faith that they won't return. He's thinking the dogs see
this as a kind of elaborate game of hide-and-seek.
</P>
<P>
   And all of it, he says, is his wife's fault.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but I'd suggest they just keep the dogs. It will save
on gas and energy trying to drive them away. Besides, the guy may
find out he can hunt better than he ever thought. It worked for the
Clampetts.

   TURKEY-HUNTING _ ATLANTA _ ``Gobble,'' he said. Silence. Far
away, a crow cawed. ``Gobblegobblegobble,'' he continued,
passionately, flogging a fallen tree trunk with his hat to make a
sound like the beating of large wings. Still no reply. Finally Doug
Benefield got to his feet, shaking his head in disgust. ``He's a
wise old bird,'' Benefield said. ``He's gone.'' Benefield is a
master of the art of talking to turkeys, but this time he was
unable to persuade an old tom to venture across the sights of his
shotgun. It tended to prove that the suburban South Fulton County
turkey is just as wily as his country cousin. (Warner, Atlanta

Dawn Cottrell doesn't have any friends. Classmates tease her

her own pain. (Thompson, Dayton Daily News) MOVED WEDNESDAY.

 &HT;    Digging up solutions to a hole-y problem
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   An interesting problem gleaned from the Internet:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this beautiful old bureau that I've stripped down to
the original wood only to find that over the years various knobs
and pulls have been applied to the drawer fronts. Any suggestions
on the best method to hide the roughly 1/8-inch plastic wood-filled
holes that show?''
</P>
<P>
   One gentleman responded with, ``Drill the holes and hammer golf
tees into them, and then saw them off flush.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch. That might suffice if you're going to paint the drawers,
but otherwise it will merely highlight the holes.
</P>
<P>
   There's no simple answer for dealing with this problem in
well-aged wood. Basically, the best way to fill unwanted holes is
to take a scrap of the same wood and, using a plug cutter in a
drill press, produce plugs of the proper size.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have any plug cutters, you should be able to find
them at any woodworker's store. They aren't expensive, and they can
be a lifesaver for repairing all kinds of damage in addition to
unwanted screw and bolt holes.
</P>
<P>
   If necessary, enlarge the holes so that the plugs you make are a
perfect fit.
</P>
<P>
   Since the plugs show side grain at the surface, reasonable care
in matching the grain should result in a fairly invisible repair,
although if a number of repairs have to be made in fairly close
proximity invisibility may be out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   The point, however, is to repair side grain with side grain.
Plugging side grain with end grain isn't going to make a very neat
repair.
</P>
<P>
   The problem this gentleman has, of course, is trying to get new
wood (the plugs) to match the old wood of the drawer fronts.
</P>
<P>
   I should add that among the advice he got was the simplest, and
in general perhaps the best, method _ use a drawer pull with a big
base plate, large enough to cover the holes. Alas, he reported, the
holes are way too far apart to be covered this way.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, if you have a tiny hole to fill, and you don't
want to drill it out so that you can cut a plug to fill it, try
this:
</P>
<P>
   Take a matching piece of wood and with a backsaw or a dozuki,
cut a tiny cross-grain square sliver and carefully sand it to a
point. This is problematic, of course, because it's going to break
very easily, but it doesn't have to be long. It just has to be thin
enough to get started into the hole.
</P>
<P>
   With a wooden or rubber mallet, tap the sliver in until it fills
the hole. However square it may be to begin with, it will expand to
fill the round hole. Cut any overhang with a knife, then plane it
flush with the surrounding area.

   LATHAM-COLUMN _ MARSHALL, Texas _ A guy came by my office a
while back with a problem. It was his wife. This leaves the

of problems could stretch forever. (Latham, Marshall News

Benefield got to his feet, shaking his head in disgust. ``He's a
wise old bird,'' Benefield said. ``He's gone.'' Benefield is a
master of the art of talking to turkeys, but this time he was
unable to persuade an old tom to venture across the sights of his

 &HT;    Digging up solutions to a hole-y problem
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   An interesting problem gleaned from the Internet:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this beautiful old bureau that I've stripped down to
the original wood only to find that over the years various knobs
and pulls have been applied to the drawer fronts. Any suggestions
on the best method to hide the roughly 1/8-inch plastic wood-filled
holes that show?''
</P>
<P>
   One gentleman responded with, ``Drill the holes and hammer golf
tees into them, and then saw them off flush.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch. That might suffice if you're going to paint the drawers,
but otherwise it will merely highlight the holes.
</P>
<P>
   There's no simple answer for dealing with this problem in
well-aged wood. Basically, the best way to fill unwanted holes is
to take a scrap of the same wood and, using a plug cutter in a
drill press, produce plugs of the proper size.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have any plug cutters, you should be able to find
them at any woodworker's store. They aren't expensive, and they can
be a lifesaver for repairing all kinds of damage in addition to
unwanted screw and bolt holes.
</P>
<P>
   If necessary, enlarge the holes so that the plugs you make are a
perfect fit.
</P>
<P>
   Since the plugs show side grain at the surface, reasonable care
in matching the grain should result in a fairly invisible repair,
although if a number of repairs have to be made in fairly close
proximity invisibility may be out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   The point, however, is to repair side grain with side grain.
Plugging side grain with end grain isn't going to make a very neat
repair.
</P>
<P>
   The problem this gentleman has, of course, is trying to get new
wood (the plugs) to match the old wood of the drawer fronts.
</P>
<P>
   I should add that among the advice he got was the simplest, and
in general perhaps the best, method _ use a drawer pull with a big
base plate, large enough to cover the holes. Alas, he reported, the
holes are way too far apart to be covered this way.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, if you have a tiny hole to fill, and you don't
want to drill it out so that you can cut a plug to fill it, try
this:
</P>
<P>
   Take a matching piece of wood and with a backsaw or a dozuki,
cut a tiny cross-grain square sliver and carefully sand it to a
point. This is problematic, of course, because it's going to break
very easily, but it doesn't have to be long. It just has to be thin
enough to get started into the hole.
</P>
<P>
   With a wooden or rubber mallet, tap the sliver in until it fills
the hole. However square it may be to begin with, it will expand to
fill the round hole. Cut any overhang with a knife, then plane it
flush with the surrounding area.

 &HT;    Fox a less ordinary celebrity
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ This is a story about the day in 1985 when I sat
side by side on a couch, in a hotel room with Michael J. Fox. His
cobalt blue eyes locked onto mine _ at last, a cute guy my same
height! _ as he spoke with passion and fervor.
</P>
<P>
   The story up to this point is 100 percent true. But, alas, Fox's
wife Tracy Pollan had nothing to worry about, then or now.
</P>
<P>
   The actor, then 23 and on the brink of Back to the Future
superstardom, had come to Cincinnati to attend the national
convention of the Spina Bifida Foundation. As national awareness
spokesman for the group, Fox was stepping into the role he recently
has been acclaimed for embracing: Advocate.
</P>
<P>
   He cared deeply about the cause because his nephew, Jeffrey, had
been born with spina bifida. Foreshadowing his Parkinson's disease
activism, Fox called the Spina Bifida Association and said, ``Use
me. Abuse me.''
</P>
<P>
   My brief acquaintance with Fox comes in handy when I'm speaking
to schoolchildren. When they start to wiggle and deploy paper
airplanes, I deploy the Famous Person Emergency Backup System.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I try to get them excited about journalism by telling
them, ``The best part of my job is going out and meeting people _
ordinary people who find themselves in extraordinary situations.''
</P>
<P>
   I tell them about the young woman who fought back, and fortified
her faith, after losing half her body in a devastating car
accident.
</P>
<P>
   I tell them about the home that is unfailingly brimming with
love and good cheer, even though two of their four children were
born with a degenerative disease. Even though they lost their
youngest at 3, after a bone marrow transplant that might have saved
her.
</P>
<P>
   I tell them that everyday people are the most amazing people I
meet.
</P>
<P>
   Adults nod appreciatively at this sentiment. But kids are a
tough audience. The very toughest.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a reporter, you do sometimes get to meet famous
people,'' I tell them. This snaps them to attention immediately.
Hands start flailing in the air. ``What famous people have you
met?''
</P>
<P>
   They are profoundly disappointed that I have never met Michael
Jordan. They are nonplussed by Pete Rose and have never heard of
Saul Bellow or Toni Morrison. If my friend the sportswriter were
here, I know I'd be in the dust. Thank God for Michael J. Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what struck me then was how natural, how downright regular,
he was. Only a few years ago distant from the days when he couldn't
afford a telephone, he laughed delightedly at the whole absurd
notion of stardom.
</P>
<P>
   When he tried out for the role of Alex Keaton on Family Ties, it
``was just another audition,'' Fox told me. ``It was kind of
unusual in that I said that I didn't want to do sitcom.'' He seemed
determined to enjoy the ride, however long it lasted: ``I enjoy the
celebrity. There's an instant review of how well you do your job
every time you go out on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   And now he is stepping off the ride to expend his stardom on
something far more meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   Good for him, and good for all of us. You wonder why more
celebrities, blessed with clout and capital, don't do the same
thing.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, my ``prize celebrity'' doesn't seem so much like
a celebrity after all.
</P>
<P>
   Even after nearly 20 years of stardom, he still seems more like
an ordinary guy in an extraordinary situation.

A DIM PREVIEW OF HTML VIRUSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I was recently advised, in the wake of the Love
Bug virus, to disable the preview pane of Microsoft Outlook
Express. I thought infection could be avoided as long as the file
attachment was not opened. Is it possible to acquire an infection
from the basic e-mail message?
</P>
<P>
   _ Toxic Mail
</P>
<P>
   DEAR TOX: I give up. Let's just unplug all our computers and
leave them off until it's safe, maybe during the next ``Star Trek''
convention, when these losers who think it's funny to bring systems
around the globe to a crawl will be busy wearing rubber ears and
telling knock-knock jokes in Klingonese.
</P>
<P>
   In the good old days, the pond scum would simply attach a virus
to an e-mail, and it triggered when the recipient opened it. If you
delete those without opening them (they usually have .VBS, .JS or
.EXE extensions), you'll be OK.
</P>
<P>
   Now the weasels exploit the most useful features of popular
e-mail programs to deliver their payloads. That preview pane was a
great idea until some Poindexter figured out he could send a letter
full of HTML, the Web-page design language. The pane displays the
HTML the same way a browser would, and that means you can receive
something as innocuous _ and irritating _ as a letter playing a
background song or as malicious as an embedded virus script.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the preview pane closed should protect you, but you're
still not totally safe. There are viruses such as the KakWorm,
which is attached to a letter like a signature file. Maybe the
geeks at Microsoft and all the other companies should just strip
out every useful or innovative feature from their mail programs,
and we'd all be able to sleep better.
</P>
<P>
   About all you can do is be careful about what you open, and run
virus protection software. And keep that software up to date.
Microsoft releases security patches whenever a problem is found,
and the antivirus people respond to new threats within hours.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I send free greeting cards on the Internet. Is
this why I'm getting all this spam?
</P>
<P>
   _ Deluged
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DEL: Yes. Did you think they were letting you send those
things out of the goodness of their hearts? Just like any other
business, these people build mailing lists to identify possible
customers. On the other hand, nobody says you have to give them
your ``correct'' name and e-mail address, if you get my drift.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: About two months ago, I wrote to you about a
small problem I was having with my system. Since I never heard from
you, I gave up and bought myself a brand-new one. I then sent my
existing system to my daughter via the U.S. Postal Service. After
carefully packing it in bubble wrap and newspapers, I insured it
for the same amount I paid for my new system. When it arrived at
her house, it looked like it had been run over by a dump truck. I
took the insurance money and bought her a brand-new system. Ha! Two
for one. I just wanted to thank you! Had you responded to my
problem, I would still be stuck with the old system, and my
daughter would have none. Thank you so much for ignoring me!! I am
very grateful!
</P>
<P>
   _ Thanks for Nothing
</P>
<P>
   DEAR NOTHING: It was the least I could do. Truly.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's hope no postal inspectors are reading this. They tend
to take a dim view of overinsuring easily damaged parcels. Good
luck with the interrogation!
</P>

&HT;     A PASSIONLESS, MINDLESS `PASSION OF MIND' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WESLEY MORRIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The story in the new love film ``Passion of Mind'' involves two
women, Marty and Marie, having dreams about being each other. One
lives in Provence; the other in Manhattan; both have some of the
most criminally noxious dialogue this side of NBC's ``Providence.''
Both women are played by Demi Moore, who appears to be caught in
the headlights of this ``see, I'm still on the Hollywood radar''
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Moore sounds bored when meant to express rapture, as if
nauseated by notions of happiness. If she's blinded by the monotony
here, what chance do we have? It's a performance of such
accidentally exposed blandness that one wants to taunt ``I see
London, I see France. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes in, I was having a tough time locating either
passion or mind, but the outlandish supply of couture housewares
seems endless. ``Passion of Mind'' has been co-written by Ron Bass
(``Waiting to Exhale,'' ``Snow Falling on Cedars'') as the stuff of
pure Harlequin swill. Some of it makes Judith Krantz read like
Edith Wharton.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it seems unfair that the opening helicopter shot
that pores over the French countryside doesn't feature Fabio
superimposed over it with Moore's raven locks and one side of her
face buried in his breasts. Instead, we get a certain unkempt
realism in the casting of the two men in her life, played by
Stellan Skarsgard and William Fitchner, two fine, if creepy, actors
willing to be bullied by the dictates of this paperback story.
Skarsgard, playing a French writer, is particularly engaged by all
of this.
</P>
<P>
   Moore can't help but be rotten. She has no grace and little
nuance, which is why she's always best as a hard-ass in movies by
directors with a problematic grasp of a lady's strength like Adrian
Lyne's ``Indecent Proposal'' or Ridley Scott's ``G.I. Jane,''
which, thanks to her, is still a compellingly sweaty two hours. But
Skarsgard? From the moment he enters the film as William, the
French writer to whom Marie's daughter wanders by accident, he
seems too pleased to be here.
</P>
<P>
   She panned his book; he brings candy and flowers for her two
girls. Still, she's skeptical about his advances. ``Sometimes I
wish you didn't look like you do,'' he says. ``People that look
like you have learned not to trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, this is called acting, but is there anyone who can bring
off a conversation like that without consulting Douglas Sirk first?
Still, Skarsgard doesn't let up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make love to you,'' William tells Marie. ``All my
life, sex never really brought me closer. (It's) the beginning of
the end. I don't want this to end.''
</P>
<P>
   He's a masochist and a fool. But in the truest sense of the
genre's pretenses, William is a sustained Harlequin erection, which
is to say he'll do anything to untie Marie's apron and sweep her
into his arms, make love to her, then leave her in an existential
funk. In the film's cruelest/funniest scene, Demi/Marie lies in bed
and asks, ``Can I have that much mystery?'' And Stellan/William
just rests beside her staring at the ceiling saying/thinking
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Manhattan, Marty has just started seeing an
accountant (Fitchner), in whom she's confided her dreams about
Marie. All she wants is his friendship, but he's given her a pair
of Brooklyn Bridge earrings. And her heart can seem to say no. But
there's something unsettling about Fitchner's druggy demeanor that
leads you to believe that he's turned on by the idea that he's
sleeping with two women. He should be afraid that he's taken up
with a chick who is dressed like one of Prince's ``Purple Rain''
courtesans and whose apartment looks like the Metropolitan Museum
of Art and Sotheby's took turns throwing up in it.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing we'll miss the Marie/Marty connection, director Alain
Berliner, the Frenchman who made the film about a 9-year-old drag
queen, ``Ma Vie en Rose,'' shows Marie the Francophile sucking on
Orangina and does things like juxtapose one woman rising as the
other goes to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The film's conceit is that it's meant to be a tribute to Krystof
Kieslowski's ``The Double Life of Veronique.'' But this is just a
slow dance on the director's grave. If there's any justice, the
folks at Oxygen will develop some ``Mystery Romance Theater 3000''
show to jeer love this bad.

   Back in 1956, 18-year-old Kevin Brownlow had an idea for a
movie. He and his friend Andrew Mollo would reconstruct mid-1940s
Britain from the invented perspective of a Britain occupied by Nazi
Germany. They would cast amateur actors and borrow period military
and hospital uniforms and equipment to create a country under siege
by outside forces and undermined by its own philosophical naivete
and apolitical urges.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years of considerable upheaval and with film stock
donated by Stanley Kubrick and Tony Richardson, ``It Happened
Here'' was released in a deal struck between Brownlow and Mollo
with United Artists. The studio was disturbed by one of the
passages involving a repugnant Jews vs. Aryans lecture by the
British Nazi Colin Jordan and had it omitted in a censored version.
It was an attempt to sanitize a film already steeped in visceral
and ideological ugliness.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six years later, Brownlow has reinstated that critical
scene. And for the past 18 months, ``It Happened Here'' has been
making a provocative return to the world's art houses. A preeminent
film restorationist and cinephile _ it's rumored that he began
building his film library when he was 11, and there were no VCRs
then _ Brownlow orchestrated the famously painstaking
reconstruction of Abel Gance's silent five-hour classic,
``Napoleon,'' among other works. That he redirected his passion for
restoring others' films to one of his own, is a boon for us.
</P>
<P>
   Shot in black-and-white in London years after the blitz, ``It
Happened Here'' visits entire lots reduced to rubble and hungover
with an ashen, grayed sullenness.
</P>
<P>
   Brownlow and Mollo decided to tell the story almost entirely
from the point of view of Pauline (Pauline Murray), a nurse and war
widow, whose life has been ruptured by the Nazis and by the British
liberation factions.
</P>
<P>
   Pauline simply wants law and order restored to her country.
Seeking work, she naively joins the British-Nazi occupation forces,
under the presumption that she'd be nursing sick soldiers. All
along Pauline believes that because her decision is apolitical, so,
too, should the implications of her actions be, as though there's
an unread copy of Hannah Arendt's ``On Violence'' in her medicine
bag.
</P>
<P>
   Pauline looks distantly like Greer Garson, the saintly, overly
charming '40s star, only tired, lacking radiance and untouched by
romance, Max Factor or a lucid sense of ideology. It's a complex
characterization of a smart woman making a foolish choice,
oblivious to the nightmare she's gotten herself into. The
revelation of what Pauline is being consigned to do at some remote
care facility is shot in scary too-tight close-ups. It's the kind
of thing you feared was going on. Its disclosure is a satisfying,
frightening plot twist that later shows up in numerous medical
potboilers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It Happened Here'' is shockingly true to its historic
fictional time in the vein of Aldous Huxley and George Orwell. Its
re-release seems perfectly timed to evoke the
territorial/ideological disputes raging in places like Ethiopia and
Eastern Europe and remind us what ridiculous twilight zones they
are, too.

&HT;     A CHINESE TAKEOUT ON THE WILD, WILD WEST 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WALTER ADDIEGO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An amiably dopey western action comedy, ``Shanghai Noon'' is a
nice alternative to the testosterone-powered ``Mission: Impossible
2.''
</P>
<P>
   A Jackie Chan vehicle, this kung fu horse opera trumps his last
Hollywood outing in 1998, ``Rush Hour,'' by giving him a much
better foil in the surprisingly funny Owen Wilson. The odd-couple
pairing clicks, and ``Shanghai Noon'' is funny enough that it could
make buddy pictures respectable again.
</P>
<P>
   There are dead spots, though _ the movie doesn't need to be 110
minutes. And some of the gags are warmed over Mel Brooks. Still,
the pairing of goofball Wilson (``Armageddon,'' ``Bottle Rocket'')
with the hard-working and likeable Chan makes up for a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Famous as a martial arts master who performs his own stunts,
Chan is also a decent physical comedian who has modeled himself on
Buster Keaton. Wilson's off-the-wall character, an Old West train
robber with a hint of Sean Penn's surfer-stoner from ``Fast Times
at Ridgemont High,'' is a winning creation by itself, but also
makes sparks with Chan's character. As an onscreen team, they're as
tight as a bronco buster and his saddle sores.
</P>
<P>
   The time is 1881, and after set-up sequences in China's
Forbidden City, the action switches to the American West. The
Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) has been tricked into leaving her
homeland in a kidnap plot, and Chon Wang (Chan), a lesser member of
the imperial guard, is among a contingent sent to ransom her. (The
writers toss in a few groaners about the characters' names _ does
``Chon Wang'' remind you of a certain cowboy movie star?)
</P>
<P>
   In the Nevada desert, Roy O'Bannon (Wilson), an inept if polite
bandit leader who dislikes violence, tries to hold up the train
carrying the imperial guards, setting off the movie's first martial
arts set piece. Chon Wang gets to show off his awesome array of
kung fu moves, and while there's plenty of fighting, it's not
threatening; the point is fancy choreography, not graphic
brutality.
</P>
<P>
   After Chon Wang encounters some highly intelligent Indians _ and
acquires an Indian bride (Brandon Merrill) who will help him out of
several scrapes _ he and O'Bannon pair up in Carson City, where the
evil Lo Fang (Roger Yuan) is holding the princess. Lo Fong, who
oversees Chinese railroad laborers kept in slavelike conditions, is
in cahoots with the nasty sheriff, Van Cleef (a small joke for
those who know their spaghetti westerns).
</P>
<P>
   The plight of the Chinese workers is addressed squarely, just
one of the ways the film acknowledges American racism _ but,
commendably, without losing its buoyancy. Wilson is key in
maintaining the mood; his Roy is just a laid-back guy who took up
outlawing to attract women, and likes nothing better than a mellow
evening at the Carson City bordello. He has an amusing/dumb bonding
scene with Chon Wang as the two play drinking games while soaking
in bathtubs. And he is continually astounded at his friend's
martial arts dexterity, using such nonstandard weapons as moose
antlers and horseshoes.
</P>
<P>
   Chan is Chan: personable, self-deprecating, forthright, but a
wizard with fists and feet. He seems, as always, to be having
tremendous fun. Liu is underused, though she does get to show off
some fighting moves.
</P>
<P>
   In his first feature, director Tom Dey makes good use of his
background in commercials: The comedy and actions sequences are,
for the most part, crisply paced.
</P>
<P>
   The writers, Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, throw in gags by the
bucketful, and lo, some shtick. There's impressive Big Country
photography by Dan Mindel.
</P>
<P>
   But the real inspiration of ``Shanghai Noon'' was putting
together Chan and Wilson _ better filmmaking through chemistry.

&HT;     `MILLIONAIRE' CAPTURES A NATION, AND `SHOW OF YEAR' AWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK McGUIRE  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At this time last year, the question would seem sarcastic at
best, psychotic at worst, but more than likely just plain stupid:
</P>
<P>
   Who or what can stop the juggernaut that is Regis Philbin?
</P>
<P>
   The talk going into the 1999-2000 season was about diversity, or
the lack thereof, on network television. Broadcasters scurried to
add color to their casts, but the problem they couldn't solve was
how to stop a summer show that exploded into a yearlong phenomenon:
ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire'' is responsible for adding ``Are you sure?'' and
``Is that your final answer?'' to the popular lexicon, all while
hogging multiple Top 10 ratings slots. While copycat efforts by the
other networks failed, ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' endured,
and is an easy pick for SHOW OF THE YEAR in my annual ``Tube
Awards.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at the rest of the best, worst and otherwise
notable shows, events and people from the just-concluded television
season.
</P>
<P>
   BEST SHOW: ``The Sopranos,'' HBO. This is a much closer call
than last year, when the freshman drama rocked television. While
this season failed to rise to that standard (too many uneven
moments), ``The Sopranos'' at its best is far superior to anything
else on TV. At its worst, it still beats most network fare.
</P>
<P>
   WORST SHOW: ``The Mike O'Malley Show,'' NBC. The year's first
ratings casualty, this sitcom debuted Dead on Arrival. Didn't
anybody learn from Brian Benben? Don't name a show after yourself
if it stinks. O'Malley (who can be funny) has been rewarded with a
new CBS sitcom for next season, proving conclusively that there is
life after death, on the networks at least.
</P>
<P>
   MOST VALUABLE SHOW: ``WWF Smackdown,'' UPN. The Universally
Panned Network was on the verge of oblivion before it sold what
soul it had to Vince McMahon and the World Wrestling Federation.
UPN certainly got its money's worth.
</P>
<P>
   BEST NEW DRAMA: ``The West Wing,'' NBC. This Aaron Sorkin drama
sometimes dips too deep into the sentimental well and veers back
and forth from the political left, but sharp writing and a great
ensemble cast makes this White House drama a bipartisan hit.
</P>
<P>
   BEST NEW SHOW NOT TO MAKE IT: ``Freaks and Geeks,'' NBC. Fox
bailed early on the funny Hollywood satire ``Action,'' but they
knew they were taking a chance with such an inside show. But
``Freaks and Geeks'' was a by-the-book drama, extremely well
written but ratings-challenged.
</P>
<P>
   BEST NEW COMEDY: ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' Fox. This is a
smart, sharp sitcom, combining some of the low-brow elements of
``Married ... with Children'' with the wit of ``The Simpsons.''
``Malcolm'' has been a saving grace in a horrible season for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   BEST FINALE: ``Frasier,'' NBC. Niles and Daphne running away
together on her wedding day, just as it seemed the fussy doctor had
lost her forever, was a great ``The Graduate'' twist to a very
funny and moving season-ending episode.
</P>
<P>
   BEST FINALE RUINED BY A STUPID ENDING: ``The West Wing.'' What a
missed opportunity: Lose the assassination attempt at the end (memo
to writers: The presidential motorcade would never park in a
concrete canyon that amounted to a sniper shooting gallery) and you
would have had one of the best finales.
</P>
<P>
   BEST CANCELED SHOW: ``Sports Night,'' ABC. HBO might pick it up.
If not, chalk up another great show dying a ratings death. Who
cares _ just add more Regis, right?
</P>
<P>
   BIGGEST TRAIN WRECK: ``The Early Show,'' CBS. Retooling the
Bryant Gumbel show won't do it. Rehauling? Nope. Retiring? Yeah,
that's it.
</P>
<P>
   BEST EXIT: Michael J. Fox, ``Spin City,'' ABC. Spend time
looking for his bad side; you won't find one. Classy departure,
classy man.
</P>
<P>
   BEST PUNCHING BAG CRITICS WILL MISS: ``Veronica's Closet,'' NBC.
Once a Top 10 show thanks to its slot on Thursday night, the series
plummeted in the ratings when it was moved to Mondays before being
canceled. The show's title was perfect shorthand for bad
television.
</P>
<P>
   BEST MORNING KIDS SHOW: ``Zoboomafoo,'' PBS. A combination of
live action, claymation and puppetry, this morning outdoor show
introduces children to the animal kingdom, featuring good enough
cornball humor to make adults laugh.
</P>
<P>
   WRITER OF THE YEAR: Sorkin, ``The West Wing'' and ``Sports
Night.'' Sorkin unseats David E. Kelley as the most gifted
executive producer in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   BEST MINISERIES: ``The Corner,'' HBO. Further proof of the
necessity of cable, this incredible but downbeat short series never
would have aired on a broadcast network.
</P>
<P>
   BEST NETWORK MINISERIES: ``Jesus,'' CBS. Daring yet devout.
</P>
<P>
   BEST TREND: Older women actually existing on television. In the
``Logan's Run'' world of Hollywood, that means anyone over 30. Call
it the Sela Ward factor (``Once and Again,'' ABC).
</P>
<P>
   BEST MOVIE: ``Annie,'' ABC. It's still fun even after the 27th
viewing with your 3-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   BEST '60s SITCOM NOT CHRONICLED IN A BEHIND-THE-SCENES MOVIE:
None.
</P>
<P>
   MOST IMPROVED SHOW: ``King of Queens,'' CBS. Kevin James has
emerged from the shadow of his buddy, Ray Romano.
</P>
<P>
   LOW POINT OF THE SEASON: ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multi-Millionaire?'' Fox. You would think they couldn't sink lower.
You would be wrong, of course.
</P>
<P>
   BEST NETWORK TO WATCH INSTEAD OF WRITING A YEAR-END AWARDS
STORY: TV Land. ``Emergency!'' just gets funnier and funnier every
day.
</P>
<P>
   BEST GUILTY PLEASURE SHOW: ``Third Watch,'' NBC. The characters
are underdrawn, the plots are predictable and the acting is a hair
above fair. But I still watch (please don't tell anyone). It must
be a Kim Raver thing.
</P>
<P>
   EVENT OF THE SEASON: The millennium, all channels. From live
coverage of parties from around the globe to ``Three Stooges''
marathons, what was thought to be the mother of all party nights _
New Year's Eve 1999 _ turned out to be the night to stay in front
of the tube. After all, you haven't lived until you've seen a new
century dawn over Newfoundland. You wonder what they will do next
New Year's when the new millennium really arrives.
</P>
<P>
   EVENT OF THE SEASON (Runner up): The Elian Gonzalez saga. This
bizarre tale of geopolitics, a father's rights and colorful
relatives has all the makings of a made-for-TV movie. Or two. Or
five ...
</P>
<P>
   THE WORLD DID NOT END AWARD: Willow announces her lesbian love
``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' WB), and Dr. Jack McNeil said ``s---
happens'' on ``Chicago Hope'' (CBS). Somehow, television and
Western civilization survived.
</P>
<P>
   BEST QUOTES, EXECUTIVES: A tit-for-tat between Les Moonves of
CBS and Scott Sassa of NBC regarding two Jesus-based miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Jesus is better than your Jesus,'' Moonves said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did Les tell you he invented the Bible?'' Sassa countered.
</P>
<P>
   BEST OFF-SCREEN QUOTE, ACTOR: Martin Sheen of ``The West Wing,''
when asked facetiously how it felt to be the poster boy for
diversity _ ``Well, I'm Latin by birth and Irish by trade, so ...''
</P>
<P>
   WORST LOCAL COMMERCIAL: Virtually all lawyer television spots.
``If you've been bitten by a mongoose on public transportation on a
weekend holiday, you should have money coming to you.'' For these
guys, ``class'' is just another type of lawsuit.

HAVE I REACHED THE PERSON TO WHOM I AM SPEAKING? PROBABLY NOT

<TEXT>
<P>
   I am a little cranky about this thing called directory
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   I am cranky because half the time I call it, I'm given the wrong
number. I am cranky because a quarter of the time I call it, I'm
told there's no such listing. And I am cranky because every time I
call it, the phone companies tempt my slothful side by offering to
dial the number for me. (Message to AT&AMP;T: Stop it! I need that 50
cents way more than you do.)
</P>
<P>
   Believe me, I love the phone book. I have five at my desk, and I
use them as often as I can. But for out-of-town calls, I, like many
people, am at the mercy of directory assistance. I need numbers. I
need them fast. I dial the dreaded 555-1212.
</P>
<P>
   When I first decided to write this, I wondered whether these
things happened only to me. Whether directory assistance had
improved since our newspaper last wrote a story about how
lamentable it was (1997). Whether, perhaps, I somehow mysteriously
attract inept phone service. So I sent an e-mail seeking input from
friends and colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour, I had a record number of replies.
</P>
<P>
   The operator couldn't find Mineral Wells, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The operator couldn't find TXU Electric &AMP; Gas.
</P>
<P>
   The operator couldn't find the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Let's be fair. This usually isn't the fault of the poor shlub
answering the phone. ``It all has to do with them (i.e., the
government) opening the market to competition,'' says Janee
Briesemeister of Consumers Union's southwest regional office in
Austin. (Consumers Union publishes Consumer Reports magazine.)
``The (phone) companies don't want to give each other the numbers
of their customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Hello? Isn't sharing one of those make-the-world-a-better-place
behaviors we learn in kindergarten?
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, directory assistance isn't a local enterprise
anymore. There was a time when the operators actually lived and
worked in the area codes they processed. What a concept! Now I call
for a number in Boston, and I get a guy in New Mexico: ``Fenway
Park? Is that a business or a residence?'' (No, that didn't really
happen, but would it have surprised you?)
</P>
<P>
   I remember when I first moved to Chicago, sitting in a bare dorm
room and needing to call a restaurant in town. I dialed
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T, this is Mr. Winkler speaking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Winky?!'' I shouted. It was my friend Steve, who lived no more
than a 20-minute drive north. How much more neighborly can you get?
And what if the restaurant I wanted to call had just closed, or
moved, or served its steak tartare medium-rare? Theoretically,
Steve might have been able to warn me. Now THAT'S information.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we get operators who haven't even heard of the places
where we live. We call for a phone number in Trophy Club and they
balk: ``Is that really a city?'' We can see a grocery store from a
bedroom window, and they tell us there is no such place. We ask for
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, and they
ask us to spell Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   All true stories.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't just rely on anecdotes from friends. I personally
experimented with directory assistance, calling places for which I
had the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   My first request: The Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   What I got: (817) 429-2655.
</P>
<P>
   I've worked at this newspaper for four years, and I have never,
ever heard of this phone number. (Turns out, after some digging,
that it's our metro number.)
</P>
<P>
   I call for two numbers in Illinois, one in Dallas and one in
Boulder, Colo. The operators get them all right. But in between
those success stories are these: I request Salon magazine in San
Francisco, dial the number and am nearly deafened by the
high-pitched beep of a fax machine. Three times, I call for the
General Cinema Theatres headquarters _ NOT the movie theater,
please! _ in Chestnut Hill, Mass., and three times I get the movie
listings at the local General Cinemas multiplex.
</P>
<P>
   After two operators tell me there's no such business as Smith,
Bucklin &AMP; Associates in Chicago, I call the number I have for
Smith, Bucklin and ask why directory assistance has no listing for
them. ``I don't know,'' says the receptionist. ``Maybe you had a
dumb operator.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the phone companies blew it half the time _ and cost
this newspaper $14.12 for wrong, or no, numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Here's my suggestion: Get bad phone service, give bad phone
business. Don't use directory assistance unless you absolutely have
to! Dial your own numbers when you do! And call the state Public
Utility Commission to let it know which phone companies are giving
you permanent hearing loss and which are going out of their way to
be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   I'll even save you a buck and a potential throbbing headache:
</P>
<P>
   Your toll-free number for the PUC is (888) 782-8477.
</P>
<P>
   Happy complaining.

&HT;     A RUSH JOB FOR `MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL'? NOT LIKELY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MICHELLE SMITH

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ABC caved in and gave Rush Limbaugh an audition
for the ``Monday Night Football'' job. Why should this surprise us?
</P>
<P>
   NBC decided the entirety of its coverage of the Sydney Olympic
games will air on tape-delay. Why, again, should we be taken aback?
</P>
<P>
   These are just two more examples of how little the broadcast of
a sporting event has to do with the final score or the winning
time. It's high time we all accept it and move on.
</P>
<P>
   Putting sports on television merely for sports' sake is
shortsighted thinking. Why should a game or an event appeal only to
those who are genuinely interested? Let's throw the net out a
little wider and see if we can attract the casual fan, the couch
potato without a life or _ dare we dream? _ women.
</P>
<P>
   With that mandate, hiring Limbaugh, a man whose appeal (or lack
thereof) extends beyond the borders of sports, isn't that much of a
stretch. Nor is floating names like Jesse Ventura or Billy Crystal.
With that mandate, NBC can justify turning half of its Olympic
schedule into a Christina Aguilera video and the other half into a
three-hankie Lifetime movie of the week.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about demographics, which is just a fancy word for
people who buy stuff. Advertisers like to put their commercials on
shows where a lot of people who buy stuff will be watching. And
those people apparently want entertainment value.
</P>
<P>
   Giving sports a little entertainment value used to mean showing
the cheerleaders or featuring the marching band at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore, not if you can fly in Calista Flockhart and give
her good seats down the third base line or have Ted Danson stroll
by the booth and chat with the guys at the half.
</P>
<P>
   Not if you can hire someone to sit in the ``Monday Night
Football'' booth who will represent ``the fan,'' no matter how much
it bends the credibility of the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Not if you can take a competition that happens once every four
years _ an event that oozes with inherent drama _ package the
pertinent details, add colorful graphics, cut out the extraneous
elements (i.e., any competitor from another country) and set it to
music.
</P>
<P>
   There are silver linings to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Limbaugh isn't likely to get the job at ABC, which is just happy
the publicity has temporarily disguised the fact that there are no
truly good candidates out there to sit next to Al Michaels.
</P>
<P>
   And NBC has added a couple of cable networks to carry all the
sports it rendered unwatchable to the masses in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Fox begins the fifth and final year of its deal as the network
carrier for Major League Baseball on Saturday with a predictable
matchup: Boston vs. New York Yankees at 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports President Ed Goren is confident that the network will
re-up with baseball when negotiations begin in the next few months.
After paying $575 million the last time around, the price tag is
sure to go up, and NBC and CBS are certainly going to be interested
in getting in on the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commissioner (Bud Selig) and (MLB TV committee chairman)
Paul Beeson have expressed what the relationship with Fox has meant
to the game over the last four years,'' Goren said. ``When we came
in to pick up the baseball contract (in the post-strike year of
1995), baseball was going through some tough times. We stepped in
at a time when not everybody was willing to step in.''
</P>
<P>
   Loyalty probably means that Fox is going to end up in the
picture once again, but it's not going to do a thing to hold down
the price.
</P>
<P>
   For all the buttons and whistles that the folks at Fox like to
use _ you know, ``Catcher-cam'' and ``Sounds of the Game'' _ they
have done a good job with their broadcasts, mixing energy and
enthusiasm for the game with insight and information.

&HT;     JUST DON'T BITE THE BULLET AT THE NRA CAFE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As a former member of the National Rifle
Association (as a kid learning to shoot my .22) and supporter of
the right to keep arms (if not bear them under one's coat), I
wonder who's giving the NRA's Wayne LaPierre and Charlton Heston
business advice.
</P>
<P>
   Open an NRA gun-theme restaurant in Times Square?
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre, the NRA's executive vice president, floated that idea
at his organization's national convention a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson oil on salads. Browning all meats. Marlin as
safety catch of the day. Colt platters of Kalashnikov kasha and Sig
sauerkraut, with .357 Magnums of Champagne. Full metal jackets
required.
</P>
<P>
   It's too damn easy.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre and Heston, the NRA president, should realize that if
they were a 25-yard pistol target, they'd be the proverbial side of
a barn.
</P>
<P>
   No, they're not even that hard to hit.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a shot at the LaPierre-Heston NRA is like shooting at a
barn from the inside with the door shut. Why more shooters don't
find Heston and LaPierre embarrassing, I haven't a clue.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the media conspiracy, with a family history of
gun ownership dating back to the Revolutionary War musket over the
fireplace, here's some free advice for LaPierre and Heston. It
doesn't come from a mountaintop, just the top of my media-savvy
head.
</P>
<P>
   Thou shalt not wave guns in the air and yell bumper sticker
slogans.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Heston did at the NRA convention in Charlotte, N.C.,
choosing a reproduction Revolutionary War musket and the bumper
sticker slogan ``I'll give up my gun when you take it from my cold,
dead hands.''
</P>
<P>
   I wondered how many editorial writers could stick their pens
into Heston before he could load the first musketball.
</P>
<P>
   There's a scene in ``Red Dawn,'' by conservative filmmaker John
Milius, in which a Soviet paratrooper invading Colorado (don't ask)
takes a .45 from the cold, dead hand of a man lying beside his
``cold, dead hand'' bumper sticker.
</P>
<P>
   Milius, by the way, made the once-exotic .44 Magnum popular by
giving one to Clint Eastwood in the scripts he wrote for ``Dirty
Harry'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   Heston, an actor, should realize the power of an image. It's one
thing to carefully level a gun in a movie the way Eastwood did. But
you don't want to be caught in the news waving a gun unless you're
a member of the Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, we were taught never to handle a weapon that way in my
NRA gun-safety course.
</P>
<P>
   Thou shalt not let children casually handle guns, especially at
an NRA convention with a news photographer present.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the photo of Heston waving the musket at his convention
was a photograph of an 11-year-old boy sighting down the barrel of
a big stainless-steel Beretta while a woman smiled at him.
</P>
<P>
   These things aren't toys. What the hell are all these people
thinking?
</P>
<P>
   That's what the average newspaper reader thinks, and if a
photographer snaps that picture, Heston should know it will be in
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Need I go on? Or is this too easy? The Heston-LaPierre NRA
doesn't seem to have figured it out. And for a powerful political
pressure group, these guys are awfully impolitic.
</P>
<P>
   Thou shalt not accuse the president, any president, of being
``willing to accept a certain level of killing to further his
political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement in March by LaPierre about Bill Clinton even
brought a condemnation from George W. Bush, who said the NRA ``had
gone too far.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA has been going too far for years, on everything from
``cop-killer bullets'' (the name coined by media-savvy opponents
for rounds that can penetrate body armor) to their opposition to
any palliative suggested by publicity-hungry liberal opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Background checks at gun shows? Mandatory gun locks? How did
these get to be big political issues?
</P>
<P>
   The gun control issue is a standoff between two gangs that can't
think straight, with most of the townspeople stuck in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   On one side are those who think one or two more gun laws will
lead to Attorney General Janet Reno kicking in their doors. On the
other side are those who want to melt down all of the hundreds of
thousands of guns in America.
</P>
<P>
   In between are some politicians playing for votes, a bunch of
cops who don't want to knock on the doors of angry gun owners, and
the majority of Americans who know the issue is complicated, but
think something should be done about gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   A few too many guns have been pulled on a few too many
politicians in this country. It's the kind of stuff that could get
Al Gore elected _ unless Bush is smart enough to keep saying the
NRA is going too far.
</P>
<P>
   I'd hate to dine in any restaurant the NRA would run, and not
just because of the birdshot in the roast quail. They'd overdo
everything.
</P>

 MEDIA MONOPOLY MAYDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 28, or thereafter.)  
 By MAX FRANKEL  
 c.2000 The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until a few weeks ago, I expected to live out my life without
adopting a firm theory of monopoly. The subject, confounded by the
obfuscation of economists and lawyers, always struck me as
impossibly difficult. Fair competition in capitalism seemed to be
like the strike zone in baseball _ a matter of considerable
discretion and best left to the regulation of umpires.
</P>
<P>
   I even thought that some monopolies were useful; securely
profitable newspapers obviously behaved more responsibly than
economic weaklings. And big was not automatically bad: corporate
giants needed giant rivals to feel challenged and checked. I
pronounced flexibility a virtue and relied on government umpires to
protect our markets and the public interest. No longer.
</P>
<P>
   When the Time Warner cable monopoly in Manhattan chose on May
Day to deny me Peter Jennings, Regis Philbin and Ted Koppel merely
to squeeze some more millions out of Disney Co., I realized that
the umpire had been much too lax, refusing even to demand payment
for use of the broadcast spectrum or to get some free television
time for decent election coverage. All this was proof that the
media monsters will never put a public interest ahead of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner had for too long controlled not only the cables into
my home but also many of the channels and programs passing through
its wire. It was hogging both my medium and my message, and the
combination virtually guaranteed anticompetitive behavior. Now Time
Warner wants to merge with AOL and control my cable access to the
Internet as well. And still the umpire seems distracted or asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the May Day blackout was entirely Time Warner's fault.
It pulled the trigger but not without provocation from the Mickey
Mouse moguls. Because Disney, too, had been allowed to grow too fat
and to swallow up media properties like ABC and ESPN, it felt
directly threatened by the AOL Time Warner combine. Disney had also
threatened me with a blackout, showing equal disregard for my
prepaid viewing rights.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the ambitions of Disney and Time Warner are so
complementary that they are bound to find an eventual
accommodation. But their peace, like their war, will be at my
expense. If not soon reduced in size, all the overgrown media
monsters will follow in the path of Microsoft, abusing their
control over both the conduits and contents of communication to
destroy competitors and elude regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The media news in recent weeks confirms the trend. Viacom
swallowed CBS to gain control of 41 percent of the broadcast market
(and began maneuvers to overcome the frail regulatory limit of 35
percent). AT&AMP;T moved to complete its acquisition of MediaOne so as
to seize command of more than a third of the nation's cable
industry. And the five major American music companies virtually
confessed to having colluded to cheat their disc customers of more
than $500 million with various price-fixing schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Some newspapers were also caught up in these antics, an
uncomfortable reminder that the monopolistic arts antedate the Web.
Hearst Corp. was shown at trial to be finagling to kill its own San
Francisco Examiner so that it could acquire the paper's more
profitable partner, The Chronicle, and dispense with even nominal
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony revealed the use of crude promises of editorial
support for Mayor Willy Brown if he would drop his opposition and
help to gain federal approval for the scheme. The Examiner and The
Chronicle had already been merged for all functions except news
gathering under an antitrust exemption that the newspaper industry
pushed through Congress 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   These ``joint operating'' deals have done much less for
journalistic enterprise than for profits. But in any case they only
disguise and delay the drift toward print monopolies. Even before
the Hearst trial ended, a famous rivalry between The Post and The
Rocky Mountain News in Denver ended in yet another such
``joining.''
</P>
<P>
   So I have learned three things about the evolving media
business:
</P>
<P>
   1. The commendable but all-consuming prosecution of Microsoft by
the Justice Department seems to have exhausted or distracted the
umpire and left the rest of the field unguarded.
</P>
<P>
   2. The Clinton administration's repeated claim that the lure of
monopolistic profits can stimulate giant corporations to innovate
is unproved and probably wrong. As William Safire observed with an
African proverb after the May Day blackout, ``When elephants fight,
it is the grass that suffers.''
</P>
<P>
   3. The hope that the new technologies will democratize the
commerce of communication is, on present evidence, naive. The
world's half-dozen conglomerated merchants of information and
entertainment control so many conduits and so much content that
they will inevitably rig the market to favor their own
transmissions and services and to disadvantage all others.
</P>
<P>
   In some distant future, it may become possible for Americans to
get their Web-based news, fun and education by many competing
routes, including interactive cables, telephone wires, wireless
radio and satellite dishes. But for the foreseeable future, the
path of choice will be the cables that already carry TV images into
three of every four homes.
</P>
<P>
   It is the lure of owning cables that inspired AOL to offer
billions to acquire Time Warner and AT&AMP;T to mortgage itself to buy
MediaOne. They well understand, even if the umpires don't, that the
complex ``architecture'' by which small packets of data travel to
and from the Web now permits the owners of cable lines to enhance
the speed and quality of their own messages and to shortchange
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Just months ago, when America Online had reason to fear that
AT&AMP;T's new cable prowess would be used against it, AOL begged the
courts and Congress to intervene to forbid all discrimination. Yet
now that it hopes to own Time Warner's cables, AOL no longer begs;
it actively opposes government regulation. To facilitate
Washington's approval of their marriage, AOL and Time Warner
promise fair access for ``multiple'' _ if not all _ Web services.
As an alert White House should know, this all depends on what
``all'' means.
</P>
<P>
   It was fear of cable discrimination that drove Disney toward the
May Day shootout. Similar disruptions are inevitable if the media's
quasi-monopolies go unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   By far the best way to achieve openness would be to require
media corporations to choose between the business of conduit and
the business of content, between managing the lines of
communication and designing the messages and services to be
transmitted. Hoarding both functions confers monopolistic power to
rig the market and to diminish competition. The emerging
concentrations of power risk a May Day every day.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Every week or so on an asphalt court in Queens, my
buddies and I play a high-spirited if rather gimpy version of
pickup basketball. You would never need to watch our moves in slow
motion. Real time, sadly, is desultory enough. After the game, we
unwrap our Ace bandages, slide off our knee braces and pat down our
own bodies like cops to make sure all the parts are still there.
</P>
<P>
   And that's when the real dramatics begin. That's when we launch
into our Homeric chronicles of bodily degeneration. How lovingly we
narrate our twinges and spasms, the harrowing sagas of bum knees
and frayed rotator cuffs and tender ankles. Like cartographers of
the 15th century, we map out whole continents of pain, heretofore
unvisited regions of ache and bruise. To listen to us, you'd think
we had double-parked our wheelchairs in a spot of sun down in Miami
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just age catching up with us. (Some of us are
barely old enough to grow silly goatees.) It's the age. The whole
culture is transfixed by the travails of the body. Men used to be
pretty stiff-lipped about pain. Our bodies were these dumb pack
animals that lugged our lunchpails to the factory or the field and
then home again. They weren't very smart but they didn't complain
very much either. Now we live in a time when our bodies are _ or
are supposed to be _ temples to Narcissus. There at those
well-chiseled altars we beseechingly leave our offerings of
Gatorade and PowerBars and creatine.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect that our increasing body consciousness is one reason
that accounts of injuries have become one of the central tropes of
sports journalism. (That and the fact that the seasons are too
long.) This isn't to say they haven't mattered in the past: witness
Willis Reed's hobbled glory in the 1970 NBA finals or the funereal
coverage of Joe Namath's rickety knees throughout the rest of the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   What is different is how commonplace such reporting is now. At
times, the NBA playoffs have seemed less like basketball games and
more like particularly athletic episodes of ``E.R.'' (Paging Dr.
J.!)
</P>
<P>
   The plot lines read as follows: Will Tim Duncan, 24, recover
from his knee injury in time to prevent the defending champion San
Antonio Spurs from being ignominously bounced in the first round of
the playoffs? Answer: No. Can Patrick Ewing's clattering knees and
Larry Johnson's battered back survive the rigors of yet another
season? Answer: So far. Will the soft tissue _ and have we ever
heard those two words in relation to a basketball game before? _ of
the foot of the Miami Heat point guard Tim Hardaway, 33, bear up
sufficiently for a series with the Knicks? Answer: He played, but
the Knicks prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Every week USA Today issues a full page of injury reports for
major league teams in baseball, football, basketball and hockey.
It's a rather grisly if deadpan catalog of all the ways a body can
come apart under the duress of high-performance athletics: ruptured
spleens, bruised kidneys, brain concussions, torn biceps,
disintegrated ACL's, separated shoulders, even the relatively
petite-sounding turf toes (which actually hurt like hell).
</P>
<P>
   The real drama for me last football season was not whether the
Miami Dolphins would get to the Super Bowl, but whether their aging
quarterback Dan Marino, 38, would be able to lift himself off the
grass after another year of vicious pounding by opposing teams. In
baseball, it's a matter of high suspense to see whether the arm of
Boston's Bret Saberhagen, 36, recovering from its third surgery,
can pitch its way off the disabled list this season without flying
off into the grandstand at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, athletes simply face their mortal limits earlier and
more publicly than the rest of us, and in doing so, presage our
own. A year ago, one sportswriter called Patrick Ewing ``a relic in
need of grease and oil.'' He was a mere 36. The gymnast Shannon
Miller, who retired two years ago to pursue mature activities like
college and marriage, is making a ``comeback'' at the elderly age
of 23. Nothing makes you feel more decrepit than being a spectator
of the new demisport of competitive physical therapy.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, sports stories have always been about the
triumphs and failures of the body in relation to the will. Some of
these narratives of injury attest to the glories of modern
medicine, the way new surgical techniques have prolonged careers
that would have ended precipitously as recently as a decade ago.
They're also a byproduct of the Infotainment Age, wherein an
ever-expanding media must find ever more to report.
</P>
<P>
   But even more important, these point to the way American men are
starting to look at their bodies quite differently from generations
past. They're discovering the same sort of unfortunate drama
inherent in aging that women have agonized about for decades. It's
amusing, of course, that sports, a formerly male domain, should
insinuate anxiety into men in a way that contradicts the old notion
that men age gracefully, women just sag.
</P>
<P>
   As men these days watch and play sports, they're no longer just
released back into the childhood pleasures of games, of winning and
losing, but faced as well with the novel terrors of present and
future ruination. What's true for the most spectacular athletes in
the world is also true for their fans. We're all now scrutinizing
our bodies for the next sign of decay. My shoulder hurts just
thinking about it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In a place where every molecule is stretched toward the future,
nothing feels quite so freakish as looking backward. In Silicon
Valley, the very notion seems to violate the laws of physics.
Having grown up in the valley, my own sense of disorientation is
underscored by the magnitude of the changes that have swept through
this once-sleepy flatland at the foot of the San Francisco Bay over
the last 20 or so years.
</P>
<P>
   The valley not only designed and built much of the machinery
that powers the new economy but it also freed capitalism from its
old restraints of class and corporatism, transforming untold
numbers of college dropouts into multimillionaires and sparking a
technological revolution that is reshaping our lives in
unimaginably vast, complex and subtle ways.
</P>
<P>
   I should be proud of the stature of my hometown, but the truth
is that I have mixed feelings. This whirlwind has been great for my
retirement fund (even after the recent battering), and I love my
computer almost as much as I love my dog. But outrageous prosperity
does not come without a cost: most of my friends and family who do
not work for high-tech companies have long since fled the area,
driven out by skyrocketing real estate prices and snarling traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown San Jose, long a ghost town, now boasts the new Tech
Museum, an elegant Fairmont hotel, a refurbished museum of art and,
coming soon, a new city hall designed by Richard Meier. The old
concrete tilt-up office buildings that blight the industrial
landscape are slowly becoming things of the past; companies like
3Com and Novell have built artful new campuses with outdoor patios,
water sculptures and cantilevered roof supports.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change prosperity has wrought, however, is in the
faces of the people who live here. For most of the 20th century,
the population of Santa Clara County (which includes the bulk of
Silicon Valley) was about 80 percent white. Today, thanks largely
to a wave that has brought nearly 160,000 immigrants into the area
in the last decade, whites are now a minority. The 1.6 million
people who live in the county are 49 percent white, 24 percent
Hispanic, 23 percent Asian and 4 percent black.
</P>
<P>
   The defining character of Silicon Valley today is not the
pasty-faced plaid-shirt-wearing aerospace engineer, but a young
geek from Taipei or Bangalore with an H-1B visa and a fondness for
American pop culture. Although most of these new immigrants are
highly educated and technologically savvy, they have at least one
thing in common with the waves of dreamers who came through Ellis
Island a hundred years ago _ they believe America is a land of
opportunity, a place where they can build better lives.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of these new dreamers, I recently learned, have taken
up residence in my old house in Sunnyvale. I went home to meet them
and to see what the digital revolution has done to the place that
gave birth to it.
</P>
<P>
   One of those dreamers is Sara Liang, 27, of Taipei, Taiwan. To
thank her for showing me around, I offer to buy her dinner. The
following night, we head to Cupertino Village, a small shopping
center a few blocks from the house. I know the place well; I used
to ride my bike here to buy Spider-Man comic books. There was a
Rexall drugstore, a Safeway supermarket, a deli that served
excellent bratwust, a dry cleaner and a travel agent. Today, the
shopping center has been transformed into a suburban Chinatown. The
parking lot is jammed; the signs are all in Mandarin. A Chinese
supermarket called Ranch 99 is stocked with 50-pound bags of
jasmine rice and salmon heads for $2.99 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Sara is dressed in high heels, blue jeans and a Guess denim
jacket _ she is bubbly, happy, a little vain, completely charming.
As we walk around the shopping center, she tells me that she ended
up in my father's house because of an ad in The World Journal, a
Taiwanese newspaper published daily in America; when she went to
look at the room, she liked it because at $550 it was relatively
inexpensive and because it was convenient to the freeway as well as
to her office in Santa Clara. ``I only plan to stay a few months,
until my parents buy me a house,'' Sara explains.
</P>
<P>
   Although California is half a world away from Taipei, Sara says
her parents feel very comfortable here. ``There are so many Chinese
here now, it is almost like home. But you have American stock
market, American political system. It is maybe better than home.''
For Sara's parents, owning a house in the valley is also an escape
hatch from the rapidly escalating political tensions between Taiwan
and mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows what's going to happen in Taiwan,'' Sara
explains. ``Our relationship with the mainland is not good, the
stock market is not strong _ there is a lot of uncertainty. If
China invades, what happens to my parent's property? It could be
confiscated; no one knows.'' Sara, of course, wants a house for her
own reasons. For the first time in her life, she is thinking about
starting a family. She also sees a home as something that will give
her life in America some ballast: her H-1B visa, which allows her
to work in the United States for six years, will expire in three
years, and unless she has been approved for a green card by then
(highly unlikely) or has married a U.S. citizen (distinct
possibility, since her current boyfriend was recently granted
citizenship), she will have to leave the country for a year, then
reapply for another visa, which given the competition, is anything
but certain. ``If I own a house, or if my parents own a house, I
feel like it is the first step toward _ how do you say? _ putting
down roots.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the house she lives in now _ my house _ she hardly gives
it a thought. It's just a place to crash, a way station between her
last apartment and her new life. She pays her rent to a Taiwanese
immigrant who bought the place as an investment. She rarely sees
her roommates, and when she does, they don't talk much or share
meals. ``It's not like 'Friends,''' she jokes.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, my father's landscaping business fell on hard
times, and he was forced out of the company. Landscaping was on the
wrong side of the economic bell curve, and my father had difficulty
finding work after that. At about the same time, my mother decided
she wanted a divorce. Although she had no college degree and had
not held a job in 20 years, she was hired by a new company with a
dopey rainbow-colored logo: Apple Computer. She ended up working
there for the next eight years as a designer, plotting the
intricate layouts of printed circuit boards.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike my father, she caught the rising wave of prosperity in
the valley, and with stock options and a steadily escalating
salary, she did very well for herself. She eventually remarried and
began a new life. My father tried to start over, to date new women,
to begin again, but it didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   The house was the last thing he had to hold on to in a world
turned upside down. Eventually he couldn't hold on any longer. He
died of lung cancer in 1990 at the age of 53. My brother and sister
and I sold the house a few months later to a Taiwanese engineer and
his pregnant wife for $289,000. (My parents paid $19,950 for it in
1963.) As far as I knew, they were the first nonwhite family to
move onto Meadowlark Lane.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, they sold it to a Hong Kong businessman named Zhengfei
Ren, who used it primarily as a flophouse for himself and his
employees when they visited the area. Last June, Ren sold the house
to its current owner, a software engineer and real estate
speculator named Nelson Chao, for $450,000. Chao, who immigrated to
the bay area from Taiwan 26 years ago, bought the house for one
reason. ``I think it is excellent investment, even better than the
stock market,'' he says. And like any good investor, he set out to
maximize his profit, cramming in as many tenants as he could get
away with.
</P>
<P>
   There are two Franks living in the house now. The first Frank I
meet, who declines to give his last name, lives in the rear half of
what was once our living room. He is 30, tall, thin and wary. We
talk for a half-hour or so, during which he manages to tell me very
little about his life except that he was born in Beijing, came to
America to study computer science at the University of Southern
California and now works as a software engineer for Nortel
Networks.
</P>
<P>
   Like almost everyone else in the house, he is here on an H-1B
visa. The visa, which was created in 1990 largely in answer to the
high-tech industry's complaints about a shortage of skilled workers
in the United States, is the topic of heated debate right now.
</P>
<P>
   Many high-tech executives are clamoring for the federal
government to raise the ceiling on the number of workers allowed
into the country each year, arguing that the booming economy is
dependent upon attracting the best and brightest minds from around
the world. Responding to these demands, the Senate recently
introduced a bill to increase the annual allotment of six-year
visas, which had already grown to 115,000 in 1998 from 65,000 in
1990, to 195,000. Labor leaders are vehemently opposed to this
increase, arguing that the H-1B is little more than indentured
slavery and that while foreign workers are indeed important to the
new economy, the whole program needs to be substantially reformed.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the problem is that because green-card applications
are sponsored by employers _ a company basically has to say, ``We
need this person permanently'' _ visa holders are locked into an
unbalanced relationship with the corporations that hire them.
</P>
<P>
   For workers from China and India, the H-1B is a particular
problem. Although more than half the H-1B's go to citizens of those
countries, the law specifies that only 7 percent of
employment-based green cards can go to applicants from any one
country. So Indian and Chinese applicants often wait several years
for an open slot before they can even apply, and by then it is
usually too late to get a green card processed before their visas
expire. Many immigrant workers believe that although the high-tech
industry claims it wants the green-card application process
reformed, in fact the corporations are quite happy with the system
the way it is because it gives them a fresh crop of young minds to
exploit every six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information revolution is occurring on the backs of these
workers,'' says Pradeep Chaphalkar, a green-card holder from India
who is a spokesperson for the Immigrants Support Network, an
organization of workers seeking permanent residency.
</P>
<P>
   When I ask Frank if he feels exploited, he pauses and looks out
at the backyard, where the trunk of the mulberry sapling my father
and I planted 35 years ago is now as thick as my waist. ``I am very
grateful to be in this country,'' he says, then politely excuses
himself before I can ask him any more questions.
</P>
<P>
   The second Frank, I soon learn, lives in my old bedroom. ``He is
never home, he works very hard,'' Sara says, then adds with a touch
of awe, ``He's a venture capitalist.''
</P>
<P>
   I meet him a few nights later, when a well-dressed young Asian
man blows in through the front door. He is in a hurry and seems to
be talking to himself _ then I realize that he is wearing an
earpiece connected to a cell phone in his shirt pocket. He is doing
business as he walks. Sara waves him over.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Lin says goodbye to the person on the phone, pulls the
wire out of his ear and shakes my hand. He is 25, immediately
likable, though a little slick. Unlike the others in the house, his
English is impeccable, his manner casual and hip _ he is what's
known in the Chinese immigrant community as a ``banana'': yellow on
the outside, white on the inside. He was born in Taiwan and came to
L.A. with his family when he was 10. They were not struggling
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father ran a large car dealership in Taiwan, and he got
into the same business in L.A. and did pretty well,'' Frank says.
He graduated from Harvard with a degree in applied mathematics and
was immediately hired by Salomon Smith Barney. He worked in the
technology division, putting together mergers and acquisitions for
Fortune 500 companies like Hewlett Packard. He eventually tired of
the grueling hours and rigid corporate structure; when he got an
offer from Panasonic's venture-capital group in Silicon Valley, he
jumped at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty clear to me that there are a lot more
opportunities here in the valley than there are back East,'' Frank
explains. He invites me to visit him at work, and a few days later
I take him up on it. The Panasonic Digital Concepts Center, or
PDCC, which is only a few blocks from my old house, is an example
of the latest trend in venture-capital investing in Silicon Valley
_ a start-up incubator.
</P>
<P>
   Frank's first meeting the morning of my visit is with Joe
Corrigan, the CEO of Rocket8, an online auction network targeted at
teen-agers. Corrigan is here at the PDCC to pitch the coming global
dominance of his company. Besides Frank at the table are Cate
Cavanaugh and Jim Robbins, the company's principals.
</P>
<P>
   Corrigan, 25, is a polished, well-spoken guy. He rattles off
numbers, flashes charts and talks about ``data mining'' and
``scalability.'' Frank scratches notes on a yellow legal pad and
asks a few pointed questions. Cavanaugh and Robbins do the heavy
lifting, grilling Corrigan on his business plan. Corrigan has an
answer for everything, but it is clear that no one in the room is
bowled over by his pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Frank lingers in the hall and talks with me about the
flaws and the strengths in Rocket8's business model. ``Maybe we'll
take a look at them again in a year or so, after they've built up
some momentum,'' he says. This is VC-speak for ``Thanks, but no
thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, after this meeting I understand why Sara is so respectful
of him. While she is stuck on the phone 10 hours a day, selling
computer monitors and worrying about her H-1B visa, Frank works in
the valley's inner sanctum _ the place where the money is
distributed. He is one of the foot soldiers in what the Silicon
Valley social critic Paulina Borsook, author of ``Cyberselffish,''
calls ``the invasion of the MBA's'' _ the huge flood of
well-educated, soft-shoed money shufflers who are a sure sign of
what a global powerhouse the valley has become, as well a tombstone
for the wild, freewheeling days of barefoot entrepreneurs and
change-the-world technohippies. Like the elegant restaurants and
sophisticated architecture, the invasion of the MBA's is a sign
that the valley has been civilized.
</P>
<P>
   But there are signs that the underlying brutality of economic
life here is beginning to take its toll. Austin, Texas, not Silicon
Valley, was the fastest growing high-tech center in the United
States in 1999; in fact, last year, for the first time in five
years, the tide of new immigrants into the valley was offset by an
even stronger flow of people moving out.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Silicon Valley remains the capital of the new world, and
as long as it doesn't all vanish in a major earthquake, it will
probably retain its prominence for some time. The central paradox
of the valley is that although it invented the technology that has
made geography increasingly irrelevant, if you work in high tech,
this is still the place to be. Part of it is the easy access to
vast amounts of capital, which is crucial to anyone dreaming of a
start-up; part of it is simply keeping up with the buzz.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more dependent we become on technology, the more we
understand that it's in face-to-face human contact that all the
subtle energies are exchanged,'' says Paul Saffo, founder of the
Institute for the Future in Menlo Park. ``In the valley, you pick
up information about what's new and what's hot almost by osmosis.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Silicon Valley has been able to avoid the ethnic and
racial tensions that plague other regions that have absorbed large
numbers of immigrants. But easy harmony during boom times is no
great accomplishment; it remains to be seen what happens as the
boom fades. The valley's true human fault line, however, is not
race but class: it is evolving rapidly into a two-tier culture of
the technologically savvy global elite and the people who service
them.
</P>
<P>
   Sara calls me on my cell phone and says excitedly: ``I found a
house! We're closing on it today!''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, we drive to a neighborhood in west San Jose,
a couple of miles away from my old house. It is a modest area,
maybe one click down the socioeconomic scale from my neighborhood
in Sunnyvale. But the house she is buying is neat and pretty, the
nicest one on the street, with a big rose hedge and a lemon tree in
the front yard. It is hard to see it clearly because it is pouring
rain, but that doesn't dampen Sara's enthusiasm. She stares at it
through the beating windshield wipers and for moment all her
worries _ her boyfriend, her visa, her future _ seem to vanish. She
is excited, happy, bouncing in her seat. ``I was born to be an
American,'' she crows. When we return to my old house, it looks
shaggier than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Sara and I talk in the living room for a while; tonight, for the
first time since I've been back to visit, the house is bustling.
Eric, the cranky engineer I met on my first visit, heats a bowl of
soup in the microwave; the other Frank, the one who works at
Nortel, sits with his door a crack open, which, given the closed-up
nature of life in the house, is a gesture of friendliness. The hum
of activity feels not unlike it did when I was growing up there,
and for a moment I wonder if maybe my sister is wrong _ my father
is not spinning in his grave. Maybe he is looking up at these new
settlers who have landed in his beloved home and smiling, grateful
that it is being lived in by people who, in their own way, are as
optimistic and hopeful as he once was.

<P>
   FRANKEL-MEDIA-CENTERPIECE _ Until a few weeks ago, I expected to
live out my life without adopting a firm theory of monopoly. Fair
competition in capitalism seemed to be like the strike zone in
baseball _ a matter of considerable discretion and best left to the
regulation of umpires. But when the Time Warner cable monopoly in
Manhattan chose on May Day to deny me Peter Jennings, Regis Philbin
and Ted Koppel merely to squeeze some more millions out of Disney
Co., I realized that the umpire had been much too lax, refusing
even to demand payment for use of the broadcast spectrum or to get
some free television time for decent election coverage. By Max
Frankel.

&HT;     FROM SEA SHORE TO THE SWEET HOME, SHELLS ADD STYLE TO
DECORATING 
</HEADLINE>

   Seashells are not only home to mollusks, they can also be used
to decorate.
</P>
<P>
   Seashells arranged in geometrical or floral patterns embellish
objects such as picture frames, boxes, mirrors and tables. They can
also be arranged to form pictures or strung for hanging plants.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, shells and pebbles were used to decorate the
interiors of grottoes, especially in 16th- and 17th-century Greece
and Rome. Decorative shell mosaic work is also found in Pompeian
ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Shellwork became a popular pastime in the late 18th through 19th
centuries. It remains a popular pastime for amateurs, craftspeople
and artists.
</P>
<P>
   The Victorians were fond of elaborate shell art creations in
shadow boxes. Because they were fascinated with nature, they valued
natural curiosities, such as shells, to show their sophisticated
awareness of the world around them.
</P>
<P>
   Shells are collectible souvenirs from travels to the shore,
which not everyone was able to do in earlier centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Heart-shaped or octagonal boxes encrusted with shells were known
as sailors' Valentines, because 19th-century sailors purchased
these gifts to take home to their sweethearts. Early engravings
depict these Victorian shell pieces being peddled to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Seashells are also calming, which is why they are a common theme
in interior design, especially for the bath.
</P>
<P>
   Arrangements of shells might be displayed under glass domes to
protect their surfaces from chips and nicks.
</P>
<P>
   Images and designs were created by setting the shells in wet
plaster to dry in place or sewn to silk fabric. Today, epoxy glues
and glue guns are used for a quick set.
</P>
<P>
   Shells and shell art can be found at several sites on the
Internet or at antiques shops, auctions and flea markets.
</P>
<P>
   Don't throw away shards of broken shells; use them as mosaic
material on flower pots and birdbaths, or as a border or cornice in
a tile bath or cemented to the window and door frames.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't get to the beach, purchase seashells for anywhere
from pennies to $100 and up.

LOOK TO THE OLD TESTAMENT FOR IDEAS ON WOMEN'S ROLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL HARRAL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just about the time my denomination fades from the news, someone
somewhere stirs things up. The latest is whether women should serve
as pastors.
</P>
<P>
   A revision to the Baptist Faith and Message Statement _ the
official, though nonbinding, declaration of what Southern Baptists
believe _ probably will say that they shouldn't serve as pastors.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed statement to be considered at the June convention
in Orlando, Fla., says: ``While both men and women are gifted and
called for ministry, the office of pastor is limited to men as
qualified by Scripture.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the denomination told women that they should be
submissive to their husbands. That also was based on interpretation
of Scripture.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a lifelong Baptist _ and the Baptists' record on women is
mixed, even though there is scriptural evidence of their
significance in the ministry of Jesus and in the early churches.
</P>
<P>
   We all know that much of the church's work is done by women.
That's certainly true in Baptist churches, and I imagine that it is
true in religions where people sit in the mud, grunt and eat ants.
</P>
<P>
   And there is good evidence of strong and significant women in
the Judeo-Christian tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Tamar, the daughter-in-law of Judah. Her story is found
in Genesis 38.
</P>
<P>
   Judah, after conspiring with his brothers to sell Joseph into
slavery, married a Canaanite woman. They had three sons, the oldest
named Er.
</P>
<P>
   But Er died leaving his wife, Tamar, without child. Following
Jewish law, Judah sent his second son to her, but he, too, died
without fathering a child. Judah's only got one son left, and he's
unwilling to risk him. So he urges Tamar to go live with her
father.
</P>
<P>
   After Judah's wife dies, he's on a journey, and Tamar learns of
it. She discards her widow's clothes, covers her face with a veil
and waits for Judah beside the road.
</P>
<P>
   Judah does not recognize her, and they strike a business deal,
if you know what I mean. He's short of cash and leaves some
personal possessions as assurance that he will send a man with
proper payment. But by then, Tamar has disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Judah hears that his daugher-in-law is pregnant, and he
orders that she be burned. But she sends the things he left with
her, saying that the father of the child is the owner of those
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``She hath been more righteous than I; because I gave her not to
Shelah my son,'' Judah says.
</P>
<P>
   Tamar had twins. One was named Zarah and the other Pharez.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   The Book of Ruth reports that during a famine a man, his wife _
Naomi _ and their sons left Israel and went to Moab to live. The
sons married Moabite women: Orpah and Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   Naomi's husband died, and later so did both her sons. Neither
Orpah or Ruth had children. Naomi wanted to return home and
suggested that her daughters-in-law return to their mothers because
she had nothing to offer. Orpah did so, but Ruth accompanied Naomi.
</P>
<P>
   Her declaration to Naomi in Ruth 1:16 is such a strong statement
of love that it is often read, sung or recited at weddings:
``Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after
thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I
will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.''
</P>
<P>
   You know the story. Ruth meets Boaz. He's a kinsman to her
husband, and ultimately they marry.
</P>
<P>
   But this is only part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Boaz was the great-great-great-great-great-grandson of Pharez,
the child born to Tamar. And the child born to Boaz and Ruth was
named Obed, and he was the grandfather of David, the greatest
Jewish king of them all and, Christians believe, a direct ancestor
of Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more.
</P>
<P>
   The late Isaac Asimov, famous writer of Bible commentary as well
as science fiction, argues that the Book of Ruth is not fully clear
to us since we don't completely understand the phrase ``Moabite
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a bit of a clue in Numbers 25:1-5.
</P>
<P>
   Israel was marching toward the Promised Land, and one of the
nations in the way was Moab. The king of Moab became quite nervous
and sicced the nation's women on the men of Israel. The Bible tells
it like this: ``While Israel was staying at Shittim, the people
profaned themselves by playing the harlot with the Moabite women.''
</P>
<P>
   Asimov's point is that to an Israelite of the fifth century
B.C., to be labeled a Moabite woman was a serious insult, and the
meaning of the Book of Ruth cannot be understood until we
substitute our most personal bias for the word ``Moabite'' in the
phrase: ``Ruth, a Moabite woman.''
</P>
<P>
   And with that image fixed firmly in your mind, remember that the
person you are visualizing is a direct ancestor of King David of
the Jews and to Jesus of the Christians.
</P>
<P>
   And that's a lesson we learned from women in the Bible. What
could we learn from modern women if they are allowed to preach to
us?
</P>

SEXUAL ABUSE LEAVES SCARS FOR LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She is still wearing her workday clothes _ a white polo shirt
tucked in a pair of jeans _ when she enters the coffee shop and
orders a tall cup of iced latte.
</P>
<P>
   She is a small woman, not more than 5 feet tall, with dark skin,
dark hair and dark eyes too afraid to trust.
</P>
<P>
   I notice the tattoo on her wrist.
</P>
<P>
   It is a red heart and gold cross with a green teardrop at its
base. On either side are the words ``I Am Loved.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the tattoo, though, are the scars that remain from the
night she cut her wrists with a razor blade after her lover left.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I cut, the pain in here went away,'' she says,
lifting her hand to her heart.
</P>
<P>
   That was two years ago, one more moment of rejection piled on
top of nearly a dozen years of sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   It started when she was 5 years old and her older brother
fondled her. Her step-grandfather did the same thing once. And so
did a neighbor who lived down the street. But most of the time, it
was her brother. By the time she was in fifth grade, the fondling
had turned to sexual intercourse. It stopped only when her brother
left home.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the damage had been done. She was drinking until
she blacked out, experimenting with drugs, anything to forget the
guilt and shame.
</P>
<P>
   As she sips her latte near a window looking out on Pipeline
Road, she tries to recount those years. Only bits and pieces remain
in her memory. She remembers the curtain over the door to the room.
She remembers how big her step-grandfather was against her small
frame; she remembers the neighbor reaching over her to turn off the
light. She remembers how the sun's rays shone through the window
where she fixed her gaze as her brother had sex with her.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers that sometimes, the sex would be rough and she
would bleed. She can still see herself standing, pulling her
panties up each time and walking away. And she remembers fearing
what would happen to her if her parents ever found out.
</P>
<P>
   When the memories are too much, she slumps, and tries to catch
the tears. I realize that, but for the grace of God, this could be
me. I search the faces of the other women around me, wonder if
perhaps they know this pain. If they ever will.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Women's Center of Tarrant County, one in every
three women in the nation will be sexually assaulted in her
lifetime; one in four girls (25 percent) will be before they turn
18. In Tarrant County, Texas, half of the victims seen at
rape-trauma clinics are children.
</P>
<P>
   Abused women don't fit a certain profile. They don't look a
certain way; they don't come from one particular ethnic or
socioeconomic group.
</P>
<P>
   What's worse, the numbers don't begin to tell the whole story.
They don't tell you, for instance, about the gastrointestinal
disorders or chronic-pain syndrome that women who have been
sexually abused often develop. Nor do they tell you about the teen
pregnancies or alcohol and substance abuse linked to the sexual
assaults.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things we look at in isolation,'' said Karen Perkins,
executive director of the Women's Center. ``But if you begin to
pull back the layers, abuse is at the root.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman in the white polo shirt and jeans is 46, the mother of
a 23-year-old woman and grandmother of a 5-month-old she helped
usher into the world.
</P>
<P>
   Her eyes light up when she remembers the birth of her
granddaughter, the same way they do when she says, ``I've been
clean six years now.''
</P>
<P>
   These may be the only truly happy moments she has known. For
sure, they are the only ones she can recount without a fountain of
tears.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, she says, she felt empty. She once went from
120 pounds to 85 in a few weeks. Had it not been for her love for
her daughter, and a referral to the Women's Center, she might be
dead.
</P>
<P>
   She says her brother and the other rapists stole the better part
of her life. The Women's Center gave it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day after I told my story, I (could) hold my head up for
the first time and know I was not to blame,'' she says. ``It's been
a long, hard process, but I believe I'm worth something now.''
</P>
<P>
   And she is no longer anonymous. Her name is Carmen.

THE THREE FACES OF JOHNNY CASH, ON THREE CDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How many lives does Johnny Cash have, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   More than most of us, at least.
</P>
<P>
   Rockabilly contemporary of Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis, country
star, drug addict, influence on rock stars such as U2 and Bob
Dylan, TV show host, scourge of the Grand Ole Opry, family man,
movie actor, born-again Christian, retro-country icon in the '90s
via ``American Recordings'' and ``Unchained'' _ Cash has been all
these during the 45 years since he began recording music.
</P>
<P>
   He was busted for bringing pills over the U.S./Mexico border in
his guitar case (1965); performed at the Nixon White House; subbed
for Bono as U2's lead singer for one song in 1993; and, last year,
was honored on a TNT special by everyone from the Mavericks to Lyle
Lovett to Wyclef Jean to the Boss.
</P>
<P>
   By any standard, this is a wild ride. But again and again,
through times fat and lean, he's come back to three major themes _
romance, salvation and often violent death _ and has sung about
them with bone-hard, sometimes-chilling directness.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes his new three-CD boxed set, ``Love God
Murder,'' a unique and timely project, one that reminds us of the
68-year-old singer's indelible place on the American landscape: 48
songs divided into the three themes of the title, with brief essays
by Cash, wife June Carter Cash, Bono, and bad-boy director Quentin
Tarantino.
</P>
<P>
   This is, first of all, a brilliant idea: The songs range from
some of his earliest recordings for Sun Records _ 1956's ``Folsom
Prison Blues'' _ to several he cut in the '90s for ``Unchained''
and ``American Recordings.'' It's hard to imagine an artist more
perfectly suited to such treatment, and hearing Cash address the
same topics over the decades broadens a listener's understanding of
how his perspective has changed with time.
</P>
<P>
   It also deepens our appreciation of him: Like Hank Williams,
Cash has never done anything in half-measures. He addresses the big
topics, sings with boundless conviction _ and like Williams, his
work can be loved or hated, but never trivialized.
</P>
<P>
   He and Williams share this, too: They sing about being tossed
into jail, killing someone and being saved on a Sunday morning with
the knowledge of one who has lived a life of extremes, of fierce
joy and sadness and anger, and took something away from every
experience, whether soul-soothing or horrific.
</P>
<P>
   ``LGM'' should not be seen as a definitive Cash retrospective _
according to Jeff Jones, senior vice president of Legacy
Recordings, Cash didn't intend it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny just called us one day in 1998 and asked if we could do
this,'' Jones says. ``We said, `Let's go.' It's here to focus
people's attention on three very spiritual parts of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Cash worked with Legacy VP of A&AMP;R Steve Berkowitz and producer
Al Quaglieri to shape the box's song selection and running order.
The choices for the essays suggested themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most obvious one was June,'' Jones says. ``And we thought
of the relationship Bono has had with him over the years. And since
a lot of songs have images you might find in one of Quentin's
films, and he's used Cash's music in his movies, we thought of
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The result may refocus the public's attention on his actual body
of work, rather than just his legend status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny Cash is like Stonehenge _ he'll always be with us,''
says Steve Dean, owner of Austin's Under the Sun, a vintage
clothing and records shop and performance space. ``Any reissue by
him is time to rejoice, in my book. We know a lot of people getting
into older country, and Johnny Cash is bigger than people realize _
he's an icon to the kids. A lot of them are only acquainted with
the Sun stuff, so they'll hear things they haven't heard before.
The themes are a great idea _ country music is so bad these days,
and this is a testament to his greatness.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a testament to his resiliency. Cash has had severe
health problems over the years, the most pressing being coping with
Shy-Drager Syndrome, a progressive, and incurable, disorder of the
brain and spinal cord. On the TNT tribute last year, Cash looked
puffy, unsteady and frail.
</P>
<P>
   But he is not done making music. He recently told ``Billboard''
that he's recording a new CD, again with Rubin, that will include
Randy Scruggs, Marty Stuart and Norman Blake, as well as vocals
from Merle Haggard. And, he said, he will definitely be recording
``The Mercy Seat,'' a song by British rocker Nick Cave. The new CD,
Jeff Jones says, may be out as soon as this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard a note, but I know he's not just resting on
his laurels,'' Jones says. ``He's an active artist who still wants
to create.''

   Many diabetics have to endure frequent, painful finger pricks to
monitor their blood sugar levels. But soon a single prick of the
finger will be enough to calibrate a watch-like monitor that can
measure blood sugar levels non-invasively throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Called the GlucoWatch, the $300 device, which is close to
achieving final approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,
could be in production by the end of this year. Diabetes experts
believe the watch will revolutionize the prospects for diabetics.
</P>
<P>
   Frequent blood sugar monitoring helps detect the excessively
high or low blood sugar levels that lead to complications such as
blindness, kidney failure and nerve damage. But many diabetics find
it painful and inconvenient to check their blood sugar more than
once or twice a day, so they are unaware of when they could be in
danger.
</P>
<P>
   The GlucoWatch, which was developed by Cygnus of Redwood City,
Calif., sits on top of a disposable gel disc that contains the same
enzyme used to measure glucose levels in home monitors. Instead of
testing the blood directly, the watch draws glucose from the body
into the disc using a tiny electric current flowing between two
terminals beneath the watch body. As the current passes through the
skin, charged molecules migrate towards the electrodes. Glucose
molecules, although uncharged, get swept up by this ion flow and
are dragged across the skin to the gel disc by the cathode.
</P>
<P>
   After putting on the GlucoWatch you have to wait for three hours
while a new gel pad hydrates and reaches equilibrium with the skin.
After this warm-up period, you calibrate the device using a glucose
level taken from a standard finger-prick test. After that, the
watch measures glucose levels every 20 minutes for a 12-hour
period. If levels go too low or too high, it sounds a warning beep.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's data that's never been available before,'' says Steven
Edelman, a diabetes specialist at the School of Medicine at the
University of California, San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Edelman, a diabetic who has worn the GlucoWatch several times,
says continuous monitoring revealed that his blood levels fell
dangerously low at night while he slept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really learned a tremendous amount,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cygnus expects the FDA to approve the GlucoWatch as a supplement
to current monitoring methods, and to advise users to perform a
traditional finger-prick test before injecting insulin.
</P>
<P>
   Satish Garg of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center
in Denver says: ``That's not real life.'' He worries that diabetics
will base their insulin dose on the GlucoWatch alone.
</P>
<P>
   Garg also fears that doctors may provide it to young children
with diabetes, even though it has only been tested in adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major concern,'' agrees Cygnus vice-president Neil
Ackerman, who says the company wants to test the device in children
as quickly as possible. &QL;

   Vaccines work simply by producing antibodies, right? Well,
probably not. This misconception coupled with basic ignorance of
how they do work is stalling the urgent quest for an AIDS vaccine,
claim leading HIV researchers. They say no one has bothered to find
out how highly successful vaccines like polio, measles and
hepatitis B actually protect people from disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed by the amount of basic science we don't know,''
said Philippe Kourilsky, director of the Paris-based Pasteur
Institute. ``We've had many successful vaccines over the past
decades but we've missed a chance to see how these vaccines work.
Each time a vaccine works the scientific community wanders off and
leaves it to the public health workers to use it _ and fails to
invest in the research. If we had done that we would have been in a
much better position to tackle the AIDS vaccine problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The assumption that successful vaccines work by simply producing
antibodies is almost certainly wrong, Neal Nathanson, director of
the U.S. Office of AIDS Research, warns. ``Hepatitis B vaccine is a
good example. It's amazingly effective but no one knows how it
works. And what's really interesting is that it does work, even
though HBV is a persistent infection _ like HIV.''
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine probably stimulates some protective effect relying
on killer T cells. But no one knows how it does it or what exactly
the process is _ even though the vaccine has been widely used for
nearly ten years. It's a similar story for other highly successful
vaccines including polio, measles and smallpox, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Ruprecht, a vaccine researcher and professor of medicine at
Harvard Medical School, points out it's hard to get funding to
research vaccines that already exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always run into prejudice,'' Ruprecht said. ``They say:
'It's old. What good is it?'''
</P>
<P>
   Even if researchers can plug these huge gaps in their basic
understanding, they may face another obstacle in their pursuit of
an AIDS vaccine. Inducing antibodies against HIV might, in the
initial stages of infection, do more harm than good, claims Ron
Montelaro of the University of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   His studies of a HIV-related virus that infects horses, known as
the equine infectious anemia virus, appears to confirm that the
antibodies which initially respond to an infection can help spread
the viruses around the body. Some vaccines designed to protect
horses from infection make them die more quickly than unvaccinated
horses, he found.
</P>
<P>
   This process, whereby antibody production helps rather than
hinders infectious agents, has been dubbed enhancement. Montelaro
suggests that these early enhancing antibodies actually help pull
virus particles into the cells they are trying to infect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an issue people haven't wanted to think about. But we
might have to,'' Montelaro said.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Levy of the University of California at San Francisco,
agrees: ``Efforts to avoid these harmful consequences of HIV
immunization must be given a high priority.'' &QL;

<P>
   Concern over the accidental planting of genetically modified
seed on several farms in Europe reached fever pitch last week. And
now a company in the United States has warned that the problem is
probably commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that it happens all the time,'' says Jeffrey
Smith, vice president of marketing and communications at Genetic ID
of Fairfield, Iowa. The company, which screens agricultural produce
for GM material, found that more than half of 20 random samples of
conventional seed taken from American distributors contained some
GM seed.
</P>
<P>
   The latest European furor began with the news that farmers
throughout the continent have planted conventional oilseed rape
containing traces of a sterile GM variety known as RT 73, which has
not been approved for commercial planting in Europe. In Britain
alone, 9000 hectares were sown with the adulterated seed in 1999,
followed by 4700 hectares this spring.
</P>
<P>
   In other European countries, including France and Sweden,
ministers have considered ordering the destruction of affected
crops. Opponents of GM crops accused governments of allowing the
release of such crops before their environmental impact had been
properly evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, Genetic ID told New Scientist that such
contamination might be just the tip of the iceberg. It says that in
tests done last year, but not widely publicized, 12 out of 20
random American consignments of conventional maize seed contained
detectable traces of GM maize. Two of these contained almost 1 per
cent GM maize.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer Hi-Bred, the largest supplier of both conventional and
GM seeds in the US, acknowledged that low levels of mingling are
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolute zero purity is not achieved in any agricultural
produce anywhere in the food chain,'' says Doyle Karr, a spokesman
for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Karr says Pioneer's conventional maize seeds exported to and
grown in Europe could well contain traces of Bt maize, a GM variety
that makes a toxin lethal to larval pests. But he adds that
European governments have already approved this variety.
</P>
<P>
   But other GM crops that have not been approved have probably
been planted on European farms. In 1998, Britain imported a total
of 491,000 tons of soybeans for sowing from the US and Canada. If
an estimated 1 percent were GM, roughly 5000 tons of GM soybeans
were unwittingly imported. The Ministry of Agriculture does not
break down statistics according to how much imported seed is used
directly in food, and how much is planted on farms.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the industry believe the solution lies in
internationally agreed testing procedures and limits on
contamination. Smith thinks a 0.1 percent limit should be set for
accidental contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't offer 0 percent, because it's not scientifically
feasible or defensible,'' Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   But such limits would raise another dilemma _ who shoulders the
responsibility if the threshold is breached? Farmers think seed
suppliers should be responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seed suppliers need to guarantee what that seed is, and
bear social and economic responsibility for that,'' says Gary
Goldberg of the American Corn Growers Association.
</P>
<P>
   But segregating crops won't be easy. Farmers in the United
States send their seed to elevators, companies that pool seed from
many farmers and then sell it on for distribution and export. A
survey of almost 1,200 elevators by Pioneer shows few are willing
to test their deliveries and segregate GM from non-GM crops this
autumn. However, Smith is confident that the companies are already
taking the lessons on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that when harvest comes around, the percentage
testing and segregating will be much higher.'' &QL;

   Air pollution can wreck trees by culling the predators that
normally keep leaf-munching insects in check, say ecologists in
Finland. Though this has long been suspected as a cause of damage
to plants, this is the first time researchers have found hard
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Plagues of insects often devastate plants in polluted areas.
Ecologists reasoned that this could happen either because pollution
makes parasites of these insects less active, or because it kills
off predators that eat the insects. Until now, however, researchers
have always failed to detect any signs that pollution keeps the
pests' enemies at bay.
</P>
<P>
   But past studies had only looked at small subsets of the
insects' enemies. Elena Zvereva and Mikhail Kozlov of the
University of Turku in Finland decided to test the theories again
by studying the entire troop of enemies of the leaf beetle Melasoma
lapponica. Exploding populations of this beetle have periodically
stripped nearly all the leaves from willow trees in forests near a
nickel-copper smelter on the Kola Peninsula in northwest Russia.
This is one of the world's worst black spots for sulfur dioxide and
heavy-metal pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Zvereva and Kozlov measured pollution levels at 10 sites up to
36 kilometers from the smelter each year between 1993 and 1998.
They also checked the density of adult beetles at the sites, and
collected evidence of predation and parasitism of adults, eggs,
larvae and pupae.
</P>
<P>
   The results showed that parasites killed more M. lapponica at
polluted sites than at relatively clean ones. But fewer predator
attacks at the polluted sites meant that overall, around 20 percent
more insects survived there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that reduced predation is one of the most important
causes of the herbivore population increase in polluted regions,''
Zvereva concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Head counts of the wood ant, one of the most voracious predators
of the beetle, confirmed that its numbers had dwindled in areas
where smog was worst.
</P>
<P>
   Zvereva says their work highlights the importance of long-term
studies of the entire range of natural enemies of animals to pin
down the effects of pollution on plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most researchers have only looked at one species or one group
of predators,'' she says. ``This may easily produce misleading
conclusions.'' &QL;

&HT;     HOLLYWOOD SCORES A HIT FOR SOME RESIDENTS OF MEXICAN TOWN

<P>
   REAL DE CATORCE, Mexico _ The town that time left behind is
being shoved into the 21st century by an American movie.
</P>
<P>
   A film crew of nearly 200 has descended onto the narrow, cobbled
streets of this village located in a remote wrinkle of the Sierra
Madres.
</P>
<P>
   And the money and influence that has cascaded in promises to
change Real de Catorce forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican,'' an action-comedy starring Brad Pitt and Julia
Roberts, is the first Hollywood movie to be shot in this former
silver mining village in the north-central state of San Luis
Potosi.
</P>
<P>
   For generations the town had but a single telephone line. The
film production company, which plans to wrap up its work by the end
of May, brought in 39 more.
</P>
<P>
   While an inadequate water system remains a challenge for Real de
Catorce's 1,200 inhabitants, the film crew has spent just over
$10,000 to replace old pipes and tap a spring in the abandoned
silver mine.
</P>
<P>
   Pistolero Productions made those upgrades for its own needs,
said Benjamin Suarez, the company's location manager. But those new
pipes will be left behind for the town to use.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the company has taken pains to avoid drawing on the
community's already-strained water system, Suarez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not Santa Claus,'' he says. ``But we are trying to be
sure the town is in better shape when we leave than when we came.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short term at least, the production is reaping dividends
for many locals.
</P>
<P>
   The town's half-dozen hotels are booked until June, and the
local grocer has seen his sales increase 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 residents have temporary jobs as extras and
construction workers earning about $12 a day. That's a respectable
sum by local standards, though minimal compared with the $20
million Roberts and Pitt each will take home for their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But benefits today sometimes come with costs tomorrow, as
another small Mexican town has discovered.
</P>
<P>
   When 20th Century Fox filmed the blockbuster film ``Titanic'' in
the tiny fishing village of Popotla, just south of San Diego, Baja
California economic development boosters and residents alike
heralded the U.S. studio for pouring money and hundreds of jobs
into the community.
</P>
<P>
   In subsequent years, however, Popotla fishermen say their catch
declined by one-third. They blame Fox for chlorinating the local
water and causing damage to marine life that could take years to
reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Few films, of course, can match ``Titanic'' for excess. In ``The
Mexican,'' instead of a doomed ocean liner, the transportation
focal point is a royal-blue El Camino.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Mexican'' of the title refers to a priceless, allegedly
cursed antique pistol. Pitt's role, described as that of a
reluctant thief, centers on retrieving the gun, while his
girlfriend, Roberts, wants him to quit the criminal life.
</P>
<P>
   A co-production of Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks Pictures and
Newmarket Group, ``The Mexican'' also features Gene Hackman and
Sean Connery.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow tape has cordoned off several blocks of Real de Catorce
since filming began in mid-April. Local children in communion dress
who run squealing nearby are shushed by production assistants
wearing cordless headsets. Diesel-powered generators grind through
the night on streets usually silent except for the braying of
burros.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade many Europeans and Americans have found Real
de Catorce to be a tranquil place to open quaint hotels and
restaurants. Dreadlock-wearing artists selling jewelry and crafts
round out the population.
</P>
<P>
   But with Hollywood in town, security guards have muscled
artisans off the streets, and travelers seeking an offbeat
adventure have found no place at the inn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little annoying, frankly,'' said Jo Moise, 36, a London
jewelry designer and a frequent visitor to Mexico. ``I can't get a
hotel; I can't get a shower.''
</P>
<P>
   She had heard the city was housing a film crew, but given Real
de Catorce's funky reputation and compact size, somehow, ``I just
thought we'd get a room and be hanging out with Brad Pitt.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before the town became a hipster's paradise, it was one of
the richest cities in Mexico, according to the state tourist board.
</P>
<P>
   Silver was discovered in 1772, and mining reached its peak in
the late 1800s. With a population near 40,000, well-to-do citizens
built exquisite homesteads, vaults for minerals and money, a
Baroque-style church and an amphitheater for viewing cockfights and
other spectacles.
</P>
<P>
   But in a few short years Real's fortunes would dramatically
reverse. The swooning value of silver on international markets
ground the economy to a halt. Those who didn't leave with the bust
fled when violent waves of the Mexican Revolution swept over the
town.
</P>
<P>
   By 1910, just 2,700 people inhabited the city.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 20th century, Real de Catorce gained a reputation
as ``un pueblo fantasma.'' People called it a ghost town, and not
just because of its dwindling population.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's Huichol Indians make pilgrimages from hundreds of miles
away to nearby mountains they consider sacred. And thousands of
Christians flock here annually to pay homage to Saint Francis,
venerated with gusto in the local church.
</P>
<P>
   Local boys lead tourists on horseback to commune with spirits of
another sort. It is said that if you listen closely when out in the
distant ruins, you can hear the cries of miners who gave their
lives to ripping silver from the earth.
</P>
<P>
   But under a blazing sun in May 2000, the phantoms most residents
are whispering about are the elusive stars of the silver screen.
</P>
<P>
   Chatter about Pitt and Roberts is constant, but actual sightings
are rare.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-age girls clutching cameras have spent recent weeks chasing
Pitt's dark blue Chevrolet Suburban (with tinted windows) from one
end of town to another. A security team confiscated film from one
young woman who managed to snap an image of the male lead.
</P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is no fault of Pistolero Productions, but it is striking to
walk just two blocks from the spruced-up hotel where Roberts is
staying and find Maria Carillo, a young mother of three who said
she has not had running water for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Carillo said she paid her $2.50 bill April 15, expecting the
water that is supposed to flow through a single slender pipe every
Thursday. She plans to pay this month's bill, too, even though she
had had no running water since before Easter.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Carillo is draining the murky water from an
open cement cistern on her rooftop for washing and cooking, and she
shook her head with a smile when asked if she was upset about the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just how it is,'' she said simply.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing municipal leaders for long-awaited water system upgrades
is a struggle village residents will have to pursue long after the
equipment trailers roll back to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, many say they appreciate the upgrade Pistolero
is leaving behind: new light bulbs in the mile-long mountain tunnel
leading to the town, and an agreement from the national phone
company, Telefonos de Mexico, for service that municipal leaders
have tried, in vain, to win for years.
</P>
<P>
   How is it that Hollywood could succeed where local politicos
could not?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the power of money,'' Suarez said with a shrug.

SMYERS ON COURSE TO TRIUMPH OVER TRAGEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Mass. _ She is a two-time world champion, won the
Hawaii Ironman, and has twice been named United States Olympic
Committee Triathlete of the Year. She is a Pan American Games gold
medalist, an icon of the sport, and held the national title six
years in a row beginning in 1990. For years, she has been beloved
for her generous spirit, admired for her sunny outlook, and feared
for her race-day nerve.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as Karen Smyers approaches Saturday's Olympic Trials, it's
the window and the truck that have put her in the spotlight. And,
especially, the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do find it ironic,'' said Smyers, 38, who has been a
professional triathlete since 1985 and has been waiting her entire
career for the triathlon to finally make its debut as an Olympic
sport, which will happen in September in Sydney. ``I've gotten more
media in the last two months than I've gotten in 16 years. I used
to think it was something you earned by your performances, but
that's not necessarily true. You have to have a good story. I guess
being a poster girl for disaster has turned me into a good story.''
</P>
<P>
   She repeats the tale with characteristic affability. For most
people, facing what she has stared down over the past three years,
the simple act of living would have become a grueling endurance
event by now, an Ironman without a finish line. Smyers, on the
other hand, still insists she inhabits a charmed space that has yet
to be burglarized.
</P>
<P>
   Among the oldest competitors at the Trials, Smyers might have
been considered a long shot in the biggest race of her life even
without the string of misfortune that began almost three years ago
and culminated in a cancer diagnosis last fall.
</P>
<P>
   --In June 1997, Smyers was changing a storm window when it
shattered and slashed her left hamstring. Facing months of
rehabilitation, Smyers and her husband, Michael King, decided it
would be a good time to start a family; after 48 hours of labor and
a caesarean section, Jenna was born May 1, 1998. Two months later,
Smyers resumed competition.
</P>
<P>
   --On Aug. 12, 1998, Smyers was clipped by an 18-wheel truck
while biking near her home and sustained six broken ribs and a
separated shoulder when she crashed and skidded into a ditch. ``I
really, literally, thought she was dead,'' said training partner
Glenn Cunha, who had been riding behind her. ``Finally, she just
let out this big sigh.'' She resumed competition in April 1999,
winning in her first race back.
</P>
<P>
   --Last September, during a checkup while she was battling
bronchitis, tests indicated she had thyroid cancer. Smyers found it
hard to believe after she finished second in the Hawaii Ironman
(2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike, 26.2-mile run) in mid-October,
leading for much of the race. ``I thought, there's got to be a
mistake,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   --In November, she broke her collarbone when she crashed her
bike over a fallen competitor during a triathlon in Mexico. Days
later, further tests confirmed the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   --On Dec. 18, Smyers had a cancerous thyroid gland and two lymph
nodes removed at Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   For a few days, she and King thought her Olympic quest might be
over; that the fatiguing effects of the immediate radioactive
iodine treatment being recommended would destroy her ability to
train in the few months remaining. But in further consultations,
several endocrinologists said there would be no harm, and might
even be some benefit, in delaying treatment of the slow-growing
cancer, which has a cure rate of better than 95 percent, until
after the Trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was all I needed to hear,'' said Smyers.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, that was all anyone else needed to hear. Soon, NBC's
``Today'' show came calling. So did ``Good Morning America'', and
ABC's ``World News Tonight'' with Peter Jennings. If it wasn't
Sports Illustrated at the door it was the Chicago Tribune; if the
phone call wasn't from Newsweek it was from US Weekly or the
Washington Post or Fox Sports or USA Today, twice. A reporter from
Asahi Shimbun, the Japanese mega-newspaper with a circulation of 8
million _ sat on Smyers's sofa earlier this week. Oprah Winfrey's
new TV-Internet venture, Oxygen, filmed her on a recent training
weekend in New Hampshire. Two-year-old Jenna can hardly get put
down for a nap these days without the aid of klieg lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``No more cameras!'' the toddler demanded recently.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take a squadron of sociologists to explain the
magnetism of Smyers's saga. ``Clearly, triumph over adversity is
one of the oldest stories in the world,'' said Paul Slavin,
executive producer of ``World News Tonight.'' ``We're always
looking for heroes, and what is a hero except for someone who
overcomes the odds?''
</P>
<P>
   Put even more simply: ``Most of us can't picture going to work
when we have the flu,'' said Nova Lanktree, president of Lanktree
Sports Celebrity Network. ``We give Dennis Rodman publicity; how
refreshing to see a story like this. There's something extremely
compelling about what it is in the human spirit that creates this
kind of human being.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No booster shot needed
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, it's certainly nothing Smyers came up with
recently. Kim Ratcliffe has known Smyers since 1979, when they met
as freshmen at Princeton. Back home in Weathersfield, Conn., Smyers
had been a high school swimmer, gymnast, and tennis player. At
Princeton she focused on swimming and began running as part of her
training. Soon enough, she was on the track team, too. By their
sophomore year, Ratcliffe and Smyers were roommates as well as
track teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways she stuck out like a sore thumb at Princeton,''
said Ratcliffe, a former amateur triathlete who urged Smyers to try
her first triathlon back in 1984, and who now lives in Carlisle.
``She didn't really get too upset about anything.'' Come to think
of it, Ratcliffe said as she pondered a friendship in its fourth
decade, ``I can't really think of a time she was visibly upset or
depressed in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Smyers's husband backs her up. ``As much as I'd like to say I've
been a good psychological booster, Karen is pretty good on her
own,'' said King, an independent film producer and amateur
triathlete who was co-owner of the now-defunct Eliot Lounge. If she
needs any courage, those who know her said, she draws it from Scott
Carlson, a former training partner who is battling the ravages of
Lou Gehrig's disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just not a `why me' kind of person,'' said Cunha, also a
friend of Carlson's. ``She really feels she's been dealt a great
hand, and she's going to do everything she can with that hand.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, she has graciously told her story to anyone with a
notebook or microphone even though, she said with a chuckle as
Jenna motored around the room chattering, she sometimes wishes
they'd find someone else's story so she could spend more time
training. ``The thing I have to be careful about is letting all the
media I'm getting make me believe all of a sudden that I'm better
than I am,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There's not much danger of that. ``I couldn't think of a better
spokesman for the sport,'' said Mike McCarley, the former
communications director of USA Triathlon now with nbcolympics.com.
``She never told me `no' and I don't think she'll ever say no to
anyone. It could be the local pennysaver and it could be NBC, she
treats everyone with the same amount of respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunha echoed McCarley's words. In 1991, while he and some
friends were mulling whether to try a triathlon, someone suggested
they talk to Smyers, who worked out at the same pool. A few weeks
after peppering her with the endless questions of a beginner, Cunha
was in a bike store and was stunned to see her photo on the cover
of a magazine, having just been named its triathlete of the year
after winning the 1990 world championship. She had given him no
clue.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really is just one of the gang,'' said Cunha, now a fellow
member of the training group Team Psycho.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Inspirational role model
</P>
<P>
   Among the many other triathletes Smyers has encouraged are
Maryellen Powers, Jennifer Gutierrez, and Siri Lindley. Powers of
Dover, N.H., was a fired-up volunteer at one Cambridge race when
Smyers urged her to take up the sport; Powers will be on the
starting line at the Trials. Gutierrez is already on the Olympic
team, having won her spot at a race in Sydney last month (Smyers
was the fourth American), while Lindley is among the favorites to
claim one of the remaining two berths on the team Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't make the team and they do,'' cracked Smyers, ``at
least I'll get some vicarious pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindley, a Connecticut native and Brown University graduate,
said Smyers is ``totally responsible'' for her turning pro after a
pep talk on a beach in Mexico after an event in 1995. ``For me,
she's been a role model in every way. You can't not like Karen,
there's just no way.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Lindley warns, anyone who disregards her over the .9-mile
swim, 24.8-mile bike, 6.2-mile run in Dallas will do so at their
peril. ``There are a couple of people out there who can do some
damage, and she is one of those people,'' said Lindley, who enters
the race as the third-ranked American while Smyers is No. 8. ``You
can never, ever count Karen out.''
</P>
<P>
   Although sponsors Nike, Oakley, Timex, and Trek have all stood
by Smyers during the three years in which she has seen little
action, the rules of the sport have not. With drafting now allowed
on the bike, Smyers has been handed a disadvantage unrelated to
injury, illness, or age: Good on the bike and great on the run, her
weakest link has long been the swim, and now it's more important
than ever to come out of the water near the leaders to get into a
good bike pack. To that end, she has spent a lot of time in the
pool since January after missing two months with that broken
collarbone, sometimes doubling her usual monthly mileage. (``In the
five months she's had to train she's done everything right,'' said
King. ``Whether that's enough or not, we'll find out.'')
</P>
<P>
   At a recent race in St. Croix, she chalked up her second-best
time there in 10 appearances. ``I have to take that as a good
sign,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it might not matter. ``Just because the mind is willing
doesn't mean it's going to happen,'' she said. ``I know I could
have my best race, and still not make it. Maybe I can't imagine
what the disappointment would be like, but looking at it right now
I feel it's important, but certainly not the end of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, regardless of the outcome the day before, Smyers will
go off her thyroid-hormone medication to prepare for the
radioactive iodine treatment she hopes will wipe out any hidden
traces of cancer.

TOWN TURNS UP ITS NOSE AT SCENTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ Perfume is meant to provoke passion, but
not the sort stirring this historic seaport.
</P>
<P>
   To the horror of perfume makers worldwide, Halifax has become
the first major center in North America to prohibit the wearing of
all cosmetic fragrances _ from Giorgio to grandmother's lavender
soap _ in most indoor public places, including municipal offices,
libraries, hospitals, classrooms, courts, and mass transit buses.
</P>
<P>
   With little fanfare, and less public debate, a city renowned for
its sea breezes and friendly folk has declared underarm deodorant,
herbal shampoos, colognes, and other scented products to be
hazardous to public health _ or at least too politically incorrect
to be countenanced. The ban, backed by ardent scent opponents,
reflects not only concern for people discomforted by fragrances but
a grim new environmental view that sees a  &UR; morning  &LR; slap of
aftershave as a blow against Mother Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aromatic chemicals are poisoning people and the planet as much
as tobacco or pesticides,'' said Karen Robinson, an anti-scent
campaigner who compares the fight against fragrances to writer
Rachel Carson's celebrated early warnings about the effects of DDT,
a powerful insecticide now restricted by law. ``We don't want a
`Silent Spring' brought by cosmetics in Halifax. We've even got
scent-free doughnut shops.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, students have been suspended from class for wearing
hair gel and other scented goo (one nearly landed in jail for
``assaulting'' his teacher's olfactory senses); an 84-year-old
woman was booted out of City Hall for wafting her customary cologne
while making a civic inquiry; and another woman was ordered off a
city bus for smelling too sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Private enterprise is joining the crusade with surprising
alacrity. The Chronicle-Herald, dominant newspaper in the city of
350,000, has ordered its employees to refrain from even ``strong
mouthwash.'' Other companies send perfumed or deodorant-wearing
workers home to a take shower, deducting the lost time from their
paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Critics are calling it the Halifax Hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're abandoning common sense in order to placate a small
handful of individuals bothered by scents,'' said City Councilor
Steve Streatch, one of the few local politicians willing to speak
for the record on what has become a highly emotional issue, with
campaigners wearing gas masks turning out to jeer anyone opposing
their view.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been wearing fragrances since biblical times,''
Streatch said. ``If someone wears too much, if they become
obnoxious to people around them, then a friend should speak to
them. Or a work supervisor. But bringing government into what
people dab on their face or rub into their underams is just too
much like Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   But anti-fragrance advocates hail Halifax as standard-bearer for
a burgeoning New Age movement. In the United States, only Marin
County, California, has displayed similar zeal in combating
perfumes and other fragrances. But its ``ban'' on scents in civic
places remains voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost alone, this good city up in Nova Scotia is showing the
courage to take a stand against neurologically toxic chemicals
guised as fragrance,'' said Fred Nelson of the Michigan-based
National Foundation for the Chemically Hypersensitive. ``Canadians
are showing an empathy for victims of the cosmetic chemical
industry that seems to be lacking among Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the hullabaloo is a syndrome called Multiple
Chemical Sensitivity, also known as environmental illness.
Sufferers claim that the ubiquitous presence of chemicals in modern
life has a cumulative effect that causes some individuals to become
violently ill at the slightest whiff of any scent, whether Chanel
No. 5 or Irish Spring.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, most US and Canadian physicians and researchers
refuse to recognize Multiple Chemical Sensitivity as a true organic
disease. Specialists say some people do suffer severely from
exposure to perfumes and scented cosmetics, but the reasons are
poorly understood and the reactions _ including headaches,
vomiting, and seizures _ do not appear to be caused by genuine
physical allergies, much less poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, mainstream epidemiologists and occupational health
doctors believe Multiple Chemical Sensitivity is a complex
psychological, or ``psychosocial'' malady.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's taking place in Halifax appears to be collective
hysteria over an illness that does not exist,'' said Dr. Ron House,
an epidemiologist at the Occupational Health Center at Toronto's
St. Michael's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The uproar is fascinating from a cultural view. But (the ban
on fragrances) isn't good medicine, it's folly _ political
pandering to a few rather strident activists,'' he said. ``Sadly,
the whole business leaves Halifax looking more crackpot than
compassionate.''
</P>
<P>
   In a case that made world headlines, a 17-year-old student named
Gary Falkenham last month was handed over to the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police by officials at a Halifax area high school after
showing up in class wearing Dippity Do hair gel and Aqua Velva
deodorant. His scent-sensitive teacher, Tanya MacDonald, demanded
that he be charged with criminal assault for supposedly
jeopardizing her health.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is insanity,'' said Charles Low, president of the
Canadian Cosmetic Toiletry and Fragrance Association. ``This
teenager was threatened not only with expulsion but a criminal
record for wearing deodorant.''
</P>
<P>
   The RCMP dutifully investigated but finally declined to bring
charges. ``We can't ignore complaints, but maybe this kind of thing
is better resolved with dialogue,'' said Sergeant Wayne Noonan.
</P>
<P>
   The school backed away from demands that Falkenham be
prosecuted, and instead suspended him for two days.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Radcliffe, columnist for the Halifax Daily News and one of
the few Haligonians to raise a public voice against the fragrance
ban, said Canada's famously civil society has lately become far too
credulous when confronted by anyone claiming to be a victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem is, we're too darn polite,'' she wrote recently.
``We don't want to inconvenience anyone, so we're constantly giving
up our rights because somebody claims it's offending them.''
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers of scented products are stunned by events
unfurling in Halifax, where sales of scented products have plunged
25 percent, according to local retailers. They are most appalled
that their industry is being cast as a ``merchant of death,'' in a
league with Big Tobacco and gunmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, people can sometimes react to strong (perfume) scents,
just like some people can react to flowers,'' said Low of the
cosmetic association.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no medical evidence that scented products cause
disease. Yet we're being lumped in with real health hazards, such
as smoking,'' he said. ``Meanwhile, it's hard not to notice that
Halifax buses haven't stopped spewing diesel emissions _ serious
pollutants _ into the air even as passengers wearing a dab of
fragrance aren't allowed aboard.''
</P>
<P>
   But cosmetics makers and perfumers may be in for a long battle.
The anti-scent movement appears to enjoy some support beyond the
hard-core activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of the country may think we are a bunch of crackpots,
but I believe some people are canaries in a coal mine,'' Stephanie
Domet, an editor at The Coast, a Nova Scotia weekly, told the
Toronto-based Globe and Mail newspaper. ``We've created a world
where some people are overly sensitive to chemicals. So is it
really such a hardship for you not to be able to pour on the
Charlie?''

LOS ANGELES BRACING FOR CONVENTION PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To the consternation of city officials and
convention planners, the sea turtles are preparing to beach.
</P>
<P>
   The costumed demonstrators, along with thousands of plainclothes
protesters, are expected to descend on Los Angeles for the
Democratic National Convention in August. Emboldened by the
so-called Battle in Seattle during last year's World Trade
Organization meeting, and this year's attention-grabbing tactics in
Washington, they intend to march, shout and tie up traffic to make
their points about economic disparity, environmental insanity and a
variety of other concerns, from gay rights to the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters even have their own shorthand for the convergence
of Democrats, the millennium and LA: D2KLA.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows quite what to expect. All sides say they want peace
to prevail. But with newly energized protesters willing to square
off against a Los Angeles Police Department whose integrity is
under attack, there is also growing fear that the confrontations
could turn ugly. To further complicate matters, the homeless have
plans to stage a rival convention for 1,000 of their own
``delegates'' just blocks from the main event at the sports and
concert arena known as Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Fithian, a key organizer of the protests for Direct Action
Network, said, ``We will be there and we will be heard. The powers
that be want to marginalize us, and we're not going to let that
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In a city where image is everything, this is hardly the image
Los Angeles had in mind when it bid to bring the Democratic
convention here. After riots, earthquakes and O.J. Simpson, the aim
was to showcase Los Angeles as a world-class city, one ready for
the new millennium rather than one just on the rebound. The
convention promised the sort of positive attention seldom seen
since the 1984 Olympics, which the city hosted to great success.
</P>
<P>
   Many still believe the convention will do just that. But the
gathering also comes at an awkward time for Los Angeles, now
embroiled in its most far-reaching police corruption scandal in
recent history. The smallest misstep by authorities is likely to
make the nightly news. A debacle like the one in Seattle, where
police fired tear gas and rubber bullets into crowds, would
probably overwhelm coverage from the convention floor and crowd out
good-news stories about the city beyond the convention center's
doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually a good time for L.A.,'' said Michael Dear,
director of the Southern California Studies Center at the
University of Southern California. ``The more exposure it gets as a
serious metropolitan city, the better, because it's been too easy
for too long for people to look at L.A. as a flaky exception to all
things American. That image is obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to be (the 1968 Democratic
convention) in Chicago all over again,'' he added. ``Could it get
hair-raising and dangerous? That's open to question. But given, as
it were, that the whole world will be watching, the LAPD has to be
on its best behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   But police professionalism could be pushed to the limits by the
broad array of protesters expected. Fithian, whose organization is
helping coordinate the activities of more than 150 protest groups,
said she expects relatively few of them to spend time in what has
been dubbed ``the protest pit'' _ an area near Staples Center that
will be set aside for demonstrators who apply for permits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be an orderly, vocal, noisy week,'' said James
Lafferty, executive director of the Los Angeles office of the
National Lawyers Guild, which is recruiting scores of legal
observers to witness the demonstrations and and dozens of lawyers
to represent those arrested. ``Civil disobedience can be done
peacefully if the police don't treat it as a military invasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Colin Rajah, director of programs at the Oakland-based
Youth Action for Globe Justice Network, which plans to send dozens
of young protesters to the area, ``It's been a long time coming,
this attention to reforming the social and economic system, and we
want to take advantage of the momentum. But the idea is to get
attention for the issues, not to have a direct confrontation with
police.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling disruptions during meetings of the World Trade
Organization in Seattle and the World Bank in Washington, law
enforcement officials say they are preparing for any and all
scenarios. The Los Angeles Police Department has canceled all
vacations for both officers and civilian personnel. The sheriff's
department will provide backup in the event of mass arrests.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal agencies have mobilized too, devising plans to
cope with everything from unruly protests to urban terrorism. Few
expect the worst, but everyone wants to be ready for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping the designated public demonstration area will
work,'' said Lieutenant Horace Frank, a spokesman for the LAPD.
``We want to allow voices to be heard, but in peaceful areas. .
.It's disconcerting to hear otherwise. We have a responsibility to
ensure the community is not disrupted and, if it is, we will have
to respond in kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Austin, a spokesman for the LA Convention 2000 host
committee, called the protest area ``a phenomenal piece of real
estate,'' near enough the convention center for delegates to take
notice and to give journalists easy access. ``The location,'' he
said, ``says a lot about our attitude toward the protesters. We
want them out front. We don't want them in Siberia.''
</P>
<P>
   The LA convention has faced a host of other obstacles, including
fund-raising and management snags. But, with Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan more personally involved, convention planners say
they expect the week to go smoothly. One reason: many of the major
groups involved in the previous protests, among them the AFL-CIO
and Friends of the Earth, have endorsed Al Gore, the presumptive
Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Still, other groups such as the Action Resource Center in Venice
have made a point of dogging Gore, hoping to get him to
disassociate himself from certain companies whose policies they
oppose or to change his stand on specific issues. The week of Aug.
14 is another chance to capture the attention of Gore, as well as
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, protest organizers insist they will not incite,
encourage, or condone violence. Instead, they say they fear that,
by taking to the streets, they will become targets themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you take action and you participate in nonviolent
confrontation, you are putting yourself at risk,'' said John
Sellers, a spokesman for the San Francisco-based Ruckus Society.
``The questions are: How far do we go? How far do they go? If you
expose the loss of democracy and the increase in corporate power,
it's likely that you will elicit a violent response from the
system.''
</P>
<P>
   In mid-July, the Ruckus Society will hold a training camp for
125 or so nonviolent convention protesters in Malibu, where they
will learn everything from how to unfurl political banners from
great heights to how to chain themselves together to avoid being
dispersed. A smaller training session is planned for Philadelphia,
where protesters also expect to be out in force for the Republican
National Convention, which begins July 31.
</P>
<P>
   In the city itself, the Los Angeles National Homeless Convention
is preparing for the arrival of 1,000 delegates from around the
country, among them homeless people, political activists and others
upset by the issues that exacerbate homelessness. Los Angeles has
one of the largest homeless populations in the country, and the
counter-convention is intended to focus attention on a group that
city officials everywhere often try to downplay during local
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as homeless people are drawing a line in the sand on
homelessness,'' said Ted Hayes, a local activist who had the idea
for the convention and who predicted as many as 10,000 local
homeless will participate. ``We're saying, `You come to L.A. and
we'll lead the way. . .' We come in decency and peace, and we hope
everyone will respect that.''

ANOTHER D-DAY IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORK, Ireland _ The man everyone fears was a 36-year-old
electrician, a bachelor, known to no one but a few co-workers,
relatives, and shadowy pals until the cops laid bare an ironclad
case.
</P>
<P>
   When the accused was sentenced to seven years in a Dublin
courtroom last week, he waved a clenched fist salute and shouted a
Gaelic slogan. His crime? He had stashed 50 pounds of Semtex, the
terrorist's explosive of choice, plus enough incendiary devices,
timers, and detonators to wreak urban havoc. Throw in some odd guns
and ammo, and he was custodian of one of the largest caches of
explosives ever seized here. He was ready for war. The court ruled
he had hidden the stuff for the Provisional Irish Republican Army.
Men like the jailed electrician _ and the threat of a renewed IRA
terror campaign _ dominate the climactic meeting Saturday of the
Ulster Unionist Council.
</P>
<P>
   This is an unwieldy 860-member conclave of the largest
Protestant political faction in the six counties that comprise
Northern Ireland. David Trimble, the Unionist chief who shared the
Nobel Peace Prize with Catholic moderate John Hume a year ago, is
trying to persuade his party's recalcitrant rank-and-file to
re-enter the stalled peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Troubles have been kept alive by the bitter-enders of both
traditions, in a scarred backwater where outrages committed 800 or
so years ago are ignited afresh with daily doses of political
kerosene. After the Good Friday peace deal, the IRA and its spruced
up mouthpiece of a political party, Sinn Fein, began playing games
with the commitment to turn over its armaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Decommissioning'' is what it's called here, but dissembling is
more like it. The issue of removing bombs, guns, and mortars from
the political dialogue matters greatly to the hard core of ``hard
men,'' possibly no more than 300 or 400 in all in the IRA and
perhaps a few more on the Protestant extremist side. Ireland's is
Europe's hottest economy _ 8 percent annual growth _ but jobs are
not desired by the hard men of both extremes. Bandits, tailgaters,
small-time hoods, and shakedown artists, they have little prosect
of becoming software engineers or peddling pricey salmon dishes to
well-heeled tourists.
</P>
<P>
   But playing the rebel card, or waving the bloody rag of
Protestant ascendancy, is still the endgame for the men who have
nowhere to go in the new economy. This is the core of the
bloody-minded intransigence of the opposing parties in the North.
On Saturday, the Unionists who want to keep Ulster lashed to some
barnacled notion of what Britain used to be debate among themselves
whether they will remain in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble seems to have staked his future and survival as leader
on his ability to eke out a majority of the 860 party leadership
for his showdown with the hardliners. Trimble wants to re-enter
peace talks, and challenge the IRA to make good on a vague promise
to put its weaponry ``beyond use.''
</P>
<P>
   Like everything else in that blighted province, words become
symbols, symbols become subterfuge, and the cycle of mistrust turns
into another round of partisan braying and political breakdown.
Playing his customary role of blustery provocateur is the Rev. Ian
Paisley, who has been marginalized to an extent by Trimble's
emergence as a leader of the Protestant coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble's argument: ``We can either decide to put the IRA to the
test or we can take the seemingly easier route and let them off the
hook. Saying `no' to this (peace process) will only serve to
consign Unionism to the political wilderness, and who knows for how
many years?'' Paisley, a padre to whom insult is always closer than
a prayer book, counters: ``(Trimble) is now not just a Provo
salesman but a Provo spokesman as well. How many times must he be
suckered before he faces up the reality he is being played for a
fool by the IRA.''
</P>
<P>
   In a land where backstabbing is literal and assassins operate
freely, Trimble's gamble has drawn the admiration of some of his
fiercest critics in the nationalist community. Standing up to the
diehards on your own side is the hardest act in politics, anywhere.
Every dawn new threats from the nationalist camp, the mostly Roman
Catholic claque of descendants of anti-British patriots who
starved, fought, or bombed their way through eight or nine
centuries (who can keep track?) of antagonism to British
colonialists.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish Republican Army gunmen and the Sinn Fein party
microphone-wielders who propagandize for them exploit the
breakdowns in the process, tossing in fresh layers of conditions.
Each side plays to its core constituency. Cast as exasperated
peacekeepers are the elected officials of England, the Irish
government in the Republic, and the United States. All three
governments have done just about everything anyone can think of to
end the armed standoff in the North. The threat of random terrorism
hangs in the air like a stench that rain won't wash away. The
antique smallmindedness of the conflict would be laughable anywhere
else. But 50 pounds of Semtex is no joke.

MOTHER DIDN'T JUST MARCH AGAINST GUNS _ SHE'S RUNNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teresa Patterson never called politicians until last year's
Columbine High School massacre. When she did, she did not like what
she heard. Suddenly, she wants to become one.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, a stay-at-home mother of three daughters, lives in
DeWitt, Mich., a suburb of Lansing. In the aftermath of Columbine,
the Michigan Legislature was considering a bill to loosen permits
for concealed weapons. The law would have allowed the number of
citizens who are allowed to carry handguns on the streets from
21,000 to an estimated 200,000.
</P>
<P>
   She phoned her state representative, Republican Valde Garcia,
who supports concealed weapons. Patterson said Garcia mouthed the
National Rifle Association party line about the Second Amendment
and the right to bear arms. ``I got so upset,'' Patterson said.
``How can people keep taking about the rights of gun owners when
the news is so hard to hear?''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson called Garcia again earlier this month before she and
her 10-year-old daughter Emily went to the Million Mom March in
Washington; Garcia had not changed. Garcia, with the NRA's
approval, last year introduced a bill to prevent Michigan cities
from suing gun manufacturers for the municipal, medical, and law
enforcement costs related to gun violence. In Detroit, the costs
are so high that police chief Benny Napoleon said, ``I absolutely,
100 percent support an effort to sue the gun makers.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said, ``Detroit and Wayne County are wasting taxpayers'
money by filing harassment lawsuits'' that would ``bankrupt the gun
industry.'' In a column in USA Today, Garcia wrote, ``More than the
Second Amendment is at stake when cities and states file lawsuits
against gun manufacturers. The entire Constitution and the
principles underlying it are, too.''
</P>
<P>
   So Patterson went off to Washington. At a hotel rally, her
daughter had her picture taken with Michigan Senator Carl Levin.
The next day on the Mall, a college roommate, Deanna Douglas, saw
how Patterson was being moved by mothers who have lost children to
gun violence and said, ``Why don't you run for office? You've been
calling all these politicians, it's time for you to get out
front.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson remembers saying, ``No, I could never do that.''
</P>
<P>
   On the 11-hour bus ride back to Michigan, Patterson never slept
a wink. Thirty-nine years old and a social worker by training, she
remembered that when she was 14, she stunned her family and friends
by volunteering through her 4H Club to go on a humanitarian mission
to Belize and Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   She used nine months of baby-sitting earnings for the trip. She
was escorted by a Peace Corps volunteer to a village, where she
lived with a 10-child family that slept in one room. Within the
first hour of her arrival, she saw a woman carrying her dead baby
out of a hospital. Malnourished children with bloated bellies
played limply outside their grass huts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trip changed my life forever,'' Patterson said. ``When I
came home, I would be at the dinner table and my brother said he
didn't want to eat peas. I would be so mad at him.'' When Patterson
got off the bus and drove home from the Million Mom March, she was
changed again, forever. She checked with the election commission to
see who was running against Garcia. No one who cared about the gun
issue was running. ``I've got to run against this guy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson filed as a Democratic candidate. Her husband, Patrick,
said, ``I thought she was crazy at first. But we've gotten through
some big projects in our marriage.'' The Pattersons once purchased
a house for $100, moved it 10 miles, restored it, and then watched
a fire burn it down. ``So I figure we'll get through this one.''
</P>
<P>
   The race is very uphill. Garcia is popular in a district that is
becoming more suburban, but remains significantly rural and
significantly progun. But Laura Baird, a pro-gun-control
representative who represents a bordering district that includes
East Lansing, said she is ``thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are going to be surprised with the number of
votes she gets from mothers,'' Baird said. ``She has already
changed the tenor of the campaign. Just a month ago, Garcia was an
obnoxious advocate for the NRA. Now he is trying to seem more
thoughtful. He is being forced to listen to other viewpoints.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said by telephone that he is confident that most of the
voters in his district still want to ``exercise the right to have a
gun.'' Patterson wants to see just how much that is true.
</P>
<P>
   ``The morning I filed, I stopped at my Catholic church to light
a candle and get my thoughts collected,'' Patterson said. ``As I
walked into the church, a maintenance man had Rush Limbaugh on.
Limbaugh was talking about how all the Million Mom March wanted to
do was repeal the Second Amendment and how the mothers were hiding
behind their sob stories. I figured that was a sign to go ahead and
run.''

WESTERN-STYLE WINNER FROM JACKIE CHAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI NOON &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; Directed by: Tom Dey &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Screenplay by: Alfred Gough, Miles Millar &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Starring: Jackie Chan, Owen Wilson, Lucy Liu, Brandon Merrill,
Roger Yuan, Xander Berkeley &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Running time: 110 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rated: PG-13 (action violence, some drug humor, language and
sensuality) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Shanghai Noon'' is the movie ``Wild Wild West'' tried to be
last summer. Essentially, it's ``Wild Wild West'' with a tiger in
its tank. Well, two tigers. Jackie Chan handles the acrobatics and
fight scenes, while Owen Wilson handles the smart-mouthing. Since
Chan's acrobatics are the closest thing movies offer to guaranteed
entertainment, and the verbal acrobatics in this case contribute as
much to the fun, it works out pretty well.
</P>
<P>
   With a plot loosely borrowed from Akira Kurosawa's ``Hidden
Fortress'' by way of ``Star Wars,'' the movie features Chan and
Wilson teaming up as a pair of scruffy lowlifes rescuing China's
kidnapped imperial princess in 1881. Chan's character, Chon Wang
(say it a few times and you'll get the joke), tags along from
Peking's Forbidden City to carry the bags of the three imperial
guards sent to Nevada to ransom the princess for a trunkful of
gold.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, as a train robber who attaches himself to the rescue
mission when he learns how much gold is involved _ after botching
the robbery of the train carrying it _ hinders Chon Wang more than
he helps him. For one thing, he's chased by what's left of his gang
of thieves. For another, he puts a gleam in the eye of a
duplicitous sheriff named Van Cleef (an homage to Sergio Leone's
favorite heavy).
</P>
<P>
   But he's always there drawling an ironic wisecrack when we need
one, which is whenever Chan, with his limited arsenal of English,
isn't windmilling his way like a chopper blade through a bunch of
bad guys. Chan is pushing 50, but he still moves with the best of
them, and he manages to put a sunny face on whatever he does. He
peaks here in a sequence involving a rope and a horseshoe, and you
wouldn't want to take him on in a game of pick-up-sticks, either.
</P>
<P>
   The film consists of a series of reinvigorated Western set
pieces, including the inevitable entrance by Chan (in a pigtail and
embroidered gown) into a saloon where the focus quickly shifts from
swinging doors to swinging fists. As usual, there's plenty of
invention and exuberant vigor in the chopsocky, and Wilson's cool,
ironic drollery provides the perfect foil for Chan's heroics.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Liu spices the mix as the princess who is anything but a
passive victim. Newcomer Brandon Merrill suggests a Native American
Catherine Zeta Jones as the bride to whom Chan's character wakes up
to find himself married inside a friendly tepee. ``Shanghai Noon''
may be little more than Chan recycling shtick, but it's great
shtick, the kind that put the motion in motion pictures in the
first place. Nobody could careen through it as entertainingly as
Chan.
</P>
<P>
   Fans will know not to jump out of their seats and leave when the
story ends, but to wait for the outtakes. These outtakes, which
show stunts going wrong and Chan always coming up smiling, of
course aren't outtakes at all. They're an integral part of every
Jackie Chan movie. They make him appear even more likably human,
remind us of how difficult it is to do this stuff, and end up
enhancing the we're-having-fun feeling that makes every movie he
makes such a high.

BIG GUNS PUSH A NEARLY FIZZLED NOVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to selling books, William Goldman's famous adage
about Hollywood holds true: Nobody knows anything. A case in point
is the novel ``Pay It Forward,'' by Catherine Ryan Hyde.
``Forward'' tells the story of a 12-year-old boy, Trevor McKinney,
who attempts to better the world through random acts of kindness.
For a school project, McKinney performs favors for three people,
and urges each one to ``pay forward'' the good deeds. It sounds
squishy, but has a bracing denouement.
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster launched ``Forward'' in February, supposedly
backing it up with a $250,000 promotion budget. The book fizzled.
Nationwide, the reviews were mixed, but the crucial New York Times
review was short and dismissive: ``Hyde created a savior, but
forgot to make him human,'' the reviewer concluded. The book
appeared on a bestseller list in San Francisco, near Hyde's home in
Cambria, Calif., and on no others.
</P>
<P>
   Now, almost four months after its formal publication date,
``Forward'' is taking off. Microsoft Corp. has decided to purchase
100,000 electronic copies as free downloads for buyers of its
just-introduced Pocket PC. The book is thriving on Amazon.com,
where reader comments _ yes, authors salt the site with puffery,
but Hyde insists she hasn't _ are wildly enthusiastic. Book groups
like it, and they'll probably like the lower-priced paperback
version, due out in the fall, even more.
</P>
<P>
   One Boston reader has helped ``Forward'' along. Spontaneously
enthused by the book, author/filmmaker Tom McCann sent copies to
about a dozen friends, including former Mintz Levin lawyer Ken
Novack, who happens to be the vice-chairman of America Online.
Novack also loved the book, and was in a position to do something
about it. Warner Brothers, which AOL recently acquired in the
Time-Warner deal, had already started editing the Kevin
Spacey-Helen Hunt film version of ``Forward,'' set for release in
October. With AOL and Warner behind the book, the simultaneous
movie/paperback launch promises to be quite auspicious.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more. Movie producer J.P. (Rick) Guerin, who brought
the book to Warner Brothers, has set up a charitable foundation
``to keep the spirit of Trevor McKinney alive in today's youth.''
The foundation hopes to fund enrichment programs in schools and in
youth detention centers. Guerin has made an initial contribution,
and he and his co-trustees McCann and Hyde are busily shaking the
Microsoft, AOL, and Warner Brothers trees, hoping for some green to
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Car talk
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Belmont optometrist Leo deNatale pulls his BMW 323 ic
convertible up to a stoplight, people honk and laugh. The reason:
he's attached a plastic lemon to the top of his radio aerial, with
the figure ``$40,000'' written in magic marker. Since buying the
car last summer, deNatale has been trying to return it to the
dealer, Foreign Motors West, using the state's ``lemon law.''
Rebuffed, he has taken his campaign to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   DeNatale, who is clearly a finicky car owner _ he successfully
used the lemon law to return a Subaru Forester last May _ says his
car has several worrisome knocks. He took it back to the dealer
three times, as required by law, and he says the knock never went
away. Furthermore, his car was in a crash while on the Foreign
Motors lot. The dealer offered to exchange the car for a pricier
model, and charge DeNatale $5,000. ``Why should I have to pay
$5,000 because they damaged my car?'' our man asks.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Motors says deNatale lowered the value of his car by
having an outside repair shop fix some dents. ``BMW has made a very
generous offer to compensate Dr. deNatale and repurchase his car,''
says Foreign Motors service chief Lance Mitchell. Furthermore, the
law does not apply to defects that are merely ``annoying'' and do
not compromise safety, or the car's value. But why would an
image-dependent company like BMW want this guy roaming the streets,
slathering them in bad publicity? Only the lawyers know for sure.

   On the Atlantic Monthly's Web site, theatlantic.com, Harvard
gender studies maven Carol Gilligan finally gets a chance to defend
her scholarship against charges leveled by Christina Hoff Sommers
in the venerable magazine's May issue. (TGIF, May 19). Gilligan
says she's on the level. In a none-dared-wish-it-longer 22-screen
rebuttal, Sommers invokes such gender dignitaries as Susan Faludi
to reaffirm her conviction that Gilligan is full of beans. Must
reading for the herstory crowd.

DRUMMER WATTS EXPLORES THE WORLD OF TECHNO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A hardened pro like Charlie Watts suddenly into techno
world-beat music? It seems unlikely that Watts _ the drumming
engine of the Rolling Stones _ could make the leap from his
famously organic sound to a techno-spiced production, yet he does
it with surprising effectiveness on the ``Charlie Watts/Jim Keltner
Project'' album that came out this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music in it is made up of drums, percussion, and
samples,'' says Watts by phone during a recent visit to New York.
``To make it more musical, I added a string bass in places and a
piano player (fellow Rolling Stone Mick Jagger is on one song).
That was the norm of it. The rest I wanted to be as techno, if you
like, as it would go.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's a brave new world when Watts, whose side projects to
the Stones are usually purist jazz albums, takes a walk on the
techno side. But it came at the prodding of Keltner, another drum
legend (known for studio sessions with everyone from Bob Dylan to
Joe Cocker, and currently backing Crosby, Stills, Nash &AMP; Young on
tour), who had a series of sequenced tracks that he wanted Watts to
play on.
</P>
<P>
   The two drummers collaborated during Watts's time off from
Stones sessions for ``Bridges to Babylon'' three years ago in Los
Angeles. Watts later took the tapes to Paris and worked with
programmer Phillipe Chauvineau to add more rhythmic samples (from
cowbell, congas, shaker, and surdu to oud, flute, and kalimba), not
to mention samples from an African choir, to complete the songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the world of modern technology,'' Watts explains. ``I
would have loved to have had 18 Africans in the room singing, but
it's very difficult to do that. I'm sure a lot of singers are going
to go, `Oh yeah?' But I don't care about that. It's all electronic.
It doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The result suggests a kind of ambient, Blue Man Group flavor on
some of the tracks, even though neither Watts nor Keltner has seen
Blue Man Group. No matter. The music is often quite original _ and
quite unexpected given the two drummers' pedigrees.
</P>
<P>
   Each song is named for a jazz drummer (``Max Roach,'' ``Art
Blakey,'' ``Airto,'' and ``Kenny Clarke,'' for example), though the
music is meant only as a broad tribute to them without specifically
mimicking their styles. The energy and conviction of each drummer
is summoned on the individual tracks, rather than the notes or
rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   The African choir comes in on ``The Elvin Suite,'' a tribute to
Elvin Jones, who played with John Coltrane's '60s quartet. A samba
beat with sampled bandoneon and strings marks the core of
``Airto,'' a tribute to Brazilian percussionist Airto. Burundi
beats underscore ``Art Blakey,'' while a rocking dance remix
characterizes ``Roy Haynes'' and laid-back synths enrich ``Tony
Williams.'' The latter is an elegant, muted requiem to Williams,
who died shortly before the recording sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The main constant is Watts's backbeat, played on his regular
Stones drum kit. That's the primary instrument, for there is almost
no guitar (except for a Keith Richards guitar insert on ``The Elvin
Suite'') and no saxophone.
</P>
<P>
   The Watts/Keltner Project evolved from Keltner's telling Watts,
``I really wish you would play on a couple of my little sequence
tunes.'' Watts complied, after hearing some of the sequenced sounds
that Keltner had put together from various sound sources such as
pipes, steel shelves, fish steamers, and boiled-egg cutters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did about four or five songs from those,'' says Keltner.
``And then the rest were built by Charlie out of these grooves that
we did. And Charlie emerged as a great producer. I didn't realize
he had those kind of chops, but he's a great producer.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts and Keltner had first met in the early '70s when the
Stones were touring Europe. Keltner hung out and traveled with
them. ``I watched Charlie every night and I was floored,'' says
Keltner. ``I became an instant copier, or tried to be a copier of
Charlie, like all drummers have, except that I had the good fortune
of being able to watch him up close _ which still didn't do me any
good as far as trying to copy him!''
</P>
<P>
   However, because Keltner was busy on another gig after the
initial recording sessions, Watts had the task of taking their
joint tapes to Paris, where he teamed up with programmer
Chauvineau.
</P>
<P>
   ``Programmers work in tiny little rooms and never see the light
of day,'' Watts says with a dry laugh. ``They have these speakers
up and big stacks of samples and a screen. I just said, `Will you
help me chop this up?' So we did that and did it a lot quicker than
I thought. I thought it would take three months and I'd be out of
there. It was a lot quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Watts and Keltner won't tour behind the album.
Keltner is still on the road with CSN&AMP;Y, while Watts needs a rest.
He also has no plans to work with the Stones any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's up to Mick and Keith,'' he says. ``If I said, `Yes, I'm
going in the studio next year,' but Mick and Keith aren't ready,
then we're not going into the studio, are we? So that's their
world. They get it together, then propose a time. It's too soon to
know what's happening there.''

PATTI SMITH ROARS BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patti Smith is on the telephone from her home in New York, and
the background noise alone is a window on her world. Oliver Ray,
Smith's 26-year-old guitarist and lover, is working out a new song
on electric guitar, and the loud chords play like a soundtrack to
Smith's gravelly, carefully chosen words. Her 12-year-old daughter
Jessie interrupts to announce that the cat, who has recently eaten
a clove of garlic, is throwing up. ``Don't worry,'' Smith murmurs.
``We can always clean it up.'' Seems it takes more than a sick
kitty to ruffle the high priestess of American punk-rock.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's new album, ``Gung Ho,'' is a visceral return to the
revolutionary poetry and nervy, grand-scale music that earned her _
over a 25-year career _ that well-deserved title. The new songs are
swollen with a sense of power and purpose. It's a spiritedness _
both musical and personal _ that Smith hasn't played with, or for
that matter felt, in a long while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel it represents me, and the band, in a position of
strength,'' Smith says. `` `Gone Again' (recorded following the
sudden death of her husband in 1994) came from a place of sorrow.
`Peace and Noise' came from a position of struggle. I was trying to
bring myself back up, reenter the world, reclaim my abilities. It's
really nice to offer something that is strength.''
</P>
<P>
   The album is the result of a long period of study, says Smith,
now 52, during which she immersed herself in the Declaration of
Independence, the American Revolution, and the lives of Mother
Theresa and Ho Chi Minh. ``The title is an obvious play on words
for Ho Chi Minh,'' whose life Smith examines in the title cut.
``It's also an old Chinese phrase that means `working together.'
It's apropos for this album because it's a very heightened
collaborative piece of work,'' explains Smith, who is touring with
her longtime band _ guitarists Lenny Kaye and Ray, bassist Tony
Shanahan, and drummer Jay Dee Daugherty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gung Ho'' tackles large social and moral issues, and Smith
hopes to bring her message to a broad audience _ an about-face from
her early days courting fans who, like herself, were far left of
center. ``When I did `Horses,' I was targeting, maybe
unconsciously, the fringe,'' she says. ``I wasn't much concerned
with people at large. But I think that we are in a time where
spirituality is an endangered species. So is political activism. So
I'm trying to wake people up, remind them of their worth, their
voice, how important their individual energy is as well as the
collective energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she feels that she's become, as a recent New York Times
article suggested, the de facto custodian of the Beat aesthetic
(along with Bob Dylan and Lou Reed), Smith is graciously humble.
``If in any way any aspect of that is passed through me, it's an
honor I wouldn't take lightly. I'll do the best I can. I was very
close with William (Burroughs) and Allen (Ginsberg). They counseled
me a lot, and I learned a lot from them in terms of work and being
a human being. William had great patience and compassion. Allen had
such active fervor, tremendous energy, and was so charitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Her circle of influential friends has indeed been vast; Smith is
writing a book about her early collaborator and close companion,
the late artist Robert Mapplethorpe. She describes the project as
``joyful/painful.'' After touring in support of ``Gung Ho'' Smith
will part ways with Arista, her label since she began her recording
career in 1975. Although it's been widely publicized that Smith is
leaving to protest the dismissal of Arista chief Clive Davis, it's
simply ``coincidental timing,'' Smith explains. ``My contract for
eight albums has been fulfilled. But to me it is apropos. Clive
served as a patron as well as my record company president. I never
sold a lot of records, but he continued to release them, and
release them the way I wanted. So I think the timing is a good
thing. No one has to be challenged,'' she laughs. ``No one has to
ask me to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   The future is uncertain. Not just for Smith personally _ she
hasn't given much thought to her next professional move _ but for
the entire human race, she says. ``I understand it would be more
realistic to be pessimistic, but what would the point be? I'm
always optimistic, for two reasons. I love living, and I have
children. (Son Jackson is now 18.) Pessimism makes people withdraw.
So I'm always writing songs. Because people accounting for
themselves is its own reward.''

   PASSION OF MIND &QL;

<P>
   Directed by: Alain Berliner &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Screenplay by: Ron Bass, David Field &QL;
</P>

   ``Passion of Mind'' is a throwback to the days when Hollywood
was avidly, glossily discovering psychotherapy. It's Demi Moore's
first film in several years, and with this role she has grown into
new dimensions of warmth and softness as a woman living in parallel
worlds, leading two rich, full lives. In one, she's a widowed mom
living with two young daughters in a comfortable house on a French
hillside. In the other, she's a high-powered Manhattan literary
agent. In each life, she's aware of her other existence. Which is
real and which is the dream? As she says to one of her two
psychiatrists (one in France, the other in New York), ``I don't
know who I am anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Summing up her problem in this psychological drama, her European
shrink, played by Joss Ackland, says, ``You're riding two horses.
And your mind is not able to do that without breaking apart.'' It's
easy to see why she might have a difficult time making a choice. In
each world, she leads a fulfilling life and has a man who's crazy
about her. In France, it's Stellan Skarsgard's writer, who stalks
her in a pleasant, charming way, ingratiates himself into her life,
and is good with the kids.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, it's William Fichtner's accountant, whom she meets
during the course of her work. The details of each romance veer
toward fantasy. The accountant is so smitten that he pays her the
ultimate compliment a workaholic can give. He takes a day off from
work to be with her. So passionate is the writer, he doesn't mind
that she wrote a review panning his novel in The New York Times.
Perhaps the fantasy set in France is greater, given the fundamental
disparity between real estate prices in the French countryside and
compensation levels for book reviewers.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, she's kept on track by a therapist played by Peter
Riegert. In France, she's shored up by the concern of Sinead
Cusack's older woman friend. ``Passion of Mind'' represents a step
forward in that neither version of Moore's character is anything
like a victim. In neither half of her split life can she forget the
other half. Still, distracted as she may be, she makes each
lifestyle work. The question is whether she'll be able to keep them
separate. In one sense, she doesn't. She lets each man know about
her other half.
</P>
<P>
   It's only a matter of time before each lover's brow begins
furrowing over her complicated dream life. Not only does each
wonder whether he'll be the one who gets her. Each must also worry
about whether he's the one who's real. Not that it's all worry. As
he demonstrated so delightfully in ``Ma Vie En Rose,'' Belgian
director Alain Berliner has a way with the trimmings of romance,
and he handles each set of courting rituals with a gossamer touch
all but unknown in mainstream filmmaking, especially in the segues
between the heroine's lives.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem with ``Passion of Mind'' is that there isn't
much passion in it. The screenplay, by the prolific Ron Bass, is
merely efficient when it must be incendiary, or at least urgent.
Never do we feel a sense of accelerating psychological tension or
internal pressure, just a set of logistical snags. So few films try
to be intelligent, adult, and gracious, as this one does, that it
seems a pity to reject it. But its sweet, decorous screenful of
Freudian dreams seems to have emerged from a gelatin mold.

   THE MESSENGER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rise and Fall of Elijah Muhammad &QL;
</P>
<P>

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two years before his death, Elijah Muhammad stood just a few
paces from Louis Farrakhan during the Nation of Islam's Savior's
Day Convention and loudly proclaimed there was no such thing as
reincarnation. People who believed in the afterlife were practicing
what he called that ``crazy Christianity religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four years later, a headline on the Web site of the
United Nation of Islam stood in stark contrast to one of the
strongest tenets of ``The Messenger'': ``The Honorable Elijah
Muhammad has returned,'' it proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   This apparent contradiction is symptomatic of a pattern of
deceit present throughout the career of Muhammad and the religion
he founded, the Nation of Islam, according to a new book. Karl
Evanzz, an online editor at the Washington Post, has assembled a
comprehensive study of the life and death of this controversial
black leader.
</P>
<P>
   Research for ``The Messenger'' draws extensively on voluminous
FBI files collected for director J. Edgar Hoover on Muhammad,
Malcolm X, Farrakhan, and other prominent Nation of Islam leaders
and members. The book contains a 24-page appendix, 74 pages of
footnotes, and a 46-page bibliography. ``The Messenger'' is
Evanzz's second book on the Nation. His first was ``The Judas
Factor: The Plot to Kill Malcolm X.''
</P>
<P>
   With so much research, Evanzz's conclusions are even more
disturbing. ``The Nation of Islam . . . has become the carcass of a
cat on a country road, its rotted flesh baked by the summer sun,''
Evanzz writes. ``Cultural vultures tear away its flesh in their
futile search for its mythical remaining lives. Today, there are
more groups called the Nation of Islam (or some variation of it)
than bicycles in China. The name no longer denotes a sect; it
denotes a twisted virtual reality game in which the cat lives all
nine lives concurrently.''
</P>
<P>
   Evanzz is not kind to Muhammad. He exposes the leader's envy of
Malcolm X, which ultimately resulted in the latter's murder. He
writes about the contradictions that cropped up throughout
Muhammad's life and preaching, most notably his practice of calling
Caucasians inferior, then hiring them to manage the sizable assets
of the Nation of Islam. Muhammad's numerous mistresses and often
cruel treatment of those perceived to be traitors are discussed as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Evanzz also highlights the powerful impact that Muhammad had on
blacks, however, starting in the 1930s and reaching a peak in the
'50s and '60s. The Nation's message of black independence, he
writes, filled the political void left by the often-token nature of
the victories earned by the civil rights movement. This message was
powerful enough to capture the imaginations _ and pocketbooks _ of
thousands of men. A young Cassius Clay was one. Singer Joe Tex was
another.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad preached black superiority, but the religious
underpinnings of the Nation were suspect. Evanzz recounts in detail
Muhammad's first meeting with a man key to the Nation of Islam's
theology called Master Wallace D. Fard.
</P>
<P>
   Fard, Muhammad said, told him about Yakub, a ``big-headed black
scientist,'' and Fard's belief that he and his followers would rule
the world through a religion-based science called ``tricknology,''
or the science of deception. According to Fard, Yakub discovered
during a genetics experiment that whites only had one white gene
for pigmentation, while blacks had two.
</P>
<P>
   ``This genetic discrepancy explained why a black man could
create a white man through selective interracial reproduction, but
a white man could never create a black man in the same way,''
Evanzz writes, citing Muhammad's ``Message to the Blackman.''
</P>
<P>
   Though one might calculate this would result in more white men
overall, Muhammad and the Nation preached otherwise: ``White people
knew that they would eventually be eliminated from Earth if
interracial marriages became routine, he said, so they had a
survival imperative to maintain a social system of racial
separation.''
</P>
<P>
   Evanzz concludes that the Nation is now little more than a
mirage: ``The Nation of Islam built by the team of Malcolm X and
the Messenger has disintegrated and become a pool of gross
mutations.''

<P>
   DOVER, N.H. _ If Jacqueline Eastwood is right, surgeons would
rather snip and solder than cut and grill.
</P>
<P>
   When surgeons need to remove cancerous tissue from a lung and
then seal it, or stop the bleeding from a diseased liver, the
process often requires staples, clips, and even burning the edges
of some organs to stop blood flow.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, medical staples can lead to air leaks in lungs. And
cauterizing tissue _ using intense heat to seal it _ often results
in smoke, charring, and tissue damage.
</P>
<P>
   Although surgeons have lived with these problems for decades,
Eastwood says she has an alternative: a hand-held device that looks
like a hair-curling wand with tiny pliers at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Her device uses a saline solution and radio-frequency generators
to cut, seal, and shrink many types of tissue, and at lower
temperatures than with electrocautery.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, she formed TissueLink Medical Inc. in a refurbished
women's shoe factory along the Cocheco River in Dover, to develop
and market a surgical device she says could be used to replace
electrocautery and other fasteners and sealants in 22 million
operating-room procedures.
</P>
<P>
   And some surgeons who have seen videotapes of prototypes of the
device in use are impressed. It was tested on dogs at the
University of Minnesota and Ohio State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sealing tissues with a minimum of scar tissue _ and possibly
replacing electrocautery, where you can end up burning material as
if you were holding a blowtorch _ is rather promising,'' said Dr.
Thomas B. Ferguson, a cardiothoracic surgeon who is emeritus
professor at Washingtion University School of Medicine in St.
Louis. He's also chairman of TissueLink's Physician Advisory Board.
</P>
<P>
   Others are skeptical that surgeons will readily change their
methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``TissueLink's device may have potential, but I don't know if it
will replace staplers and sealants,'' said Dr. John D. Wain, a
thoracic surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital and director of
its lung transplant program.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood's company, which expects to begin marketing the device
in the fourth quarter, is among a passel of companies tha are
developing products for the surgical-closure and wound-healing
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Some are the medical equivalents of hardware-store caulking,
substances that bond to tissue, organs, and blood vessels to
prevent leaks.
</P>
<P>
   These thin films, gels, adhesives, and sealants are expected to
constitute a $4 billion market by 2002, according to report
released last month by Stephens Inc., a medical device research
firm. Companies such as Focal Inc. of Lexington, Genzyme Corp. of
Cambridge, and Cryolife Inc. of Atlanta are leading the efforts to
bring new products to market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wound closure has become a big business because it can be used
in many different surgical procedures to help patients heal more
quickly with few complications _ a process with a financial
incentive to insurers because people spend less time in
hospitals,'' said Robert J. DePasqua, Focal's president and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Focal's sealant to prevent air leaks after lung surgery, called
FocalSeal, recently received Food and Drug Administration advisory
board approval and will be marketed by Genzyme.
</P>
<P>
   DePasqua acknowledged, though, that surgeons have been
relatively slow to embrace sealants, gels, and glues. Genzyme, for
example, had to lower its initial expectations for Seprafilm, a
coating to prevent surgical adhesions after gastrointestinal
operations, because surgeons were not convinced it would make a
significant difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned how to market and educate surgeons a lot better
today than we did nearly five years ago,'' said Earl ``Duke''
Collier Jr., Genzyme's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme is betting heavily on biomaterials like FocalSeal,
Seprafilm, and a new mesh material for hernia operations. They are
part of its forthcoming BioSurgery division, which shareholders are
expected to approve next month when the company completes its
acquistion of Biomatrix Inc., a Ridgefield, N.J., developer of an
injectable material to treat arthirits in the knee.
</P>
<P>
   Some surgeons, however, are starting to use sealants in
combination with surgical staplers and clips. The Ethicon division
of Johnson &AMP; Johnson and US Surgical Corp. of Norwalk, Conn.,
dominate the $2.5 billion market for surgical staplers.
</P>
<P>
   Electrocautery, a technology that dates back to 1900, is an $800
milion market led in part by ConMed Corp. of Utica, N.Y., and
ValleyLab, a Denver company.
</P>
<P>
   TissueLink Medical's technology could play a role in all these
markets, Eastwood said. Iniitally, she has focused on converting
thoracic surgeons, who perform about 300,000 lung procedures a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Her confidence in building TissueLink comes from her extensive
experience with small and large companies in the medical-device
industry, including 11 years at Medtronic Inc., the Minneapolis
medical device company where she was vice president of corporate
ventures and licensing.
</P>
<P>
   Now in her mid-50s, she left Medtronic in January 1999 with a
goal of retiring to New Hampshire so she could paint and spend time
with her family, including her two grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you told me two years ago that I would be starting a
business here, raise venture capital money, hire a staff, I would
say you were crazy,'' said Eastwood, who also moved her elderly
mother up from New York to live with her.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood's decision to postpone early retirement and start
TissueLink came after a Minneapolis surgeon tracked her down. He
told her about how he had lost a young woman, a mother of two small
children, who died on the operating table after an automobile
accident. He he could not stop the bleeding from her liver.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor remembered seeing a prototype of Medtronic's saline
and radiofrequency device that could seal tissues faster and with
fewer complications than cautery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got me thinking that this technology had potential,'' said
Eastwood, who quickly acquired the technology and patent rights
from Medtronic.
</P>
<P>
   However, more than one executive in the surgical-device market
recalled that Medtronic peddled the technology, first developed in
1995, to others. And they balked at it, questioning whether it
could close large sections of the trachea, which leads to the lungs
and is typically sealed with staples or sutures.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood said TissueLink's device, which is expected to sell for
$1,500 per operation, is not aimed at all lung surgeries, but at
the majority of lobectomies, such as the removal of part of a lung
due to cancer or emphysema. Another use would be sealing the
openings after wedges of diseased tissue are cut out.
</P>
<P>
   Persuading surgeons to switch to TissueLink's unnamed device may
prove difficult, though. Hospitals are under cost contraints for
new medical equipment, and educating surgeons about new techniques
can take years _ a lesson Genzyme learned with Seprafilm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trained in what amounts to an apprenticeship where you
learn to do something well, so unless something new comes comes
along that is very effective, most surgeons won't change,'' Wain
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Medtronic, it has licensed its technology to TissueLink
in exchange for 18 percent ownership of the company. That gave
Eastwood the leverage to raise $4 million in venture capital, split
evenly between Crescendo Venture Management LLC and Vanguard
Venture Partners. The company is seeking $15 million more and has
commitments for $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding the money has not proven very difficult, compared to
finding the right partners that understand what we want to build,''
Eastwood said.

FRESHWATER FISHING: KNOWING THE ROPES HELPS WAY UP NORTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERBURY, Vt. _ Since he retired from the local ovenworks three
years ago, WilsieWilliams does not miss a day of the trout season
on the Mad or Winooski rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Even a chilly dawn of spitting rain with rags of mist clinging
to the mountaintops finds Williams in his accustomed spot, sitting
on a milk crate casting nightcrawlers into the swollen river.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got 50, 60 right here on this point last year,'' said
Williams, who spends his spring fishing and getting next winter's
wood supply, ``but this year's been a little slow. Maybe the
water's too cold yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Green Mountains around here _ Camel's Hump, Sugarbush _ are
steep and thickly forested, with dozens of hidden streams full of
wild brookies.
</P>
<P>
   But since the state stocked the Winooski with good-sized
rainbows and browns last week, most local anglers find their own
stake out here.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Hayes and Joe Berry fish the Winooski at least four mornings
a week, and have nothing but high praise. They came with a portable
propane stove to cook the trout they expected to catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get a native fish up to 5 pounds here,'' said Berry.
``There are fish in the 2-pound range that they stock. But there
are some really nice big fish here. The best thing about the river
is even when there's a lot of fishing pressure, people can spread
out and find there own niche. You can catch fish anywhere along
here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here'' is only one stretch of the 90-mile Winooski, with its
several branches and tributaries that flow all the way to Lake
Champlain at Burlington. And as the fishing rounds into shape this
week down around Waterbury _ though some streams are still high and
muddy _ the pressure is not bad, almost nonexistent. Also nearby is
the Mad and the Dog River, the latter of which produced a
state-record trout.
</P>
<P>
   The Dog is a tributary into the Winooski that winds slowly
through farm fields. Wild brookie fishing is superb, as are the
stocked browns and rainbows, along with a few holdovers. Though
much of this land is posted, our small party had no trouble getting
permission from farmers to walk the fields along Route 12A.
</P>
<P>
   The gateway to this end of the Winooski and her tributaries is
Route 89 to Exit 10 at Waterbury, then the dirt road at the east
end of the village bridge. The road runs along the south side of
the river.
</P>
<P>
   Swinging east for a radical difference, we checked out two of
Vermont's prettiest and most fishable lakes, Willoughby and
Mephremagog in the Northeast Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   While Mephremagog _ the largest of the state's inland lakes _
jumps off at the busy tourist town of Newport (off I-91), the range
of services offered quickly has anglers fishing for wild trout,
lakers, and salmon. The salmon feed voraciously in spring, and most
anglers know the secrets of the spring run from the lake's spawning
grounds _ Barton, Black, Clyde, and Willoughby rivers. Hit these
spots at just the right time _ when fly hatch meets spring run _
and the fishing is unsurpassed in New England. The lake stretches
more than 25 miles into Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the oldest _ and almost by definition _ largest lake
trout live in the cold, 300-foot glacial depths of Willoughby,
whose soaring western cliffs and fjord make it uniquely
picturesque. Fishing Willoughby is best done in a trolling boat.
The lake is long and thin, with a launch ramp on the east shore and
up the Willoughby River about half a mile. Brown trout, rainbows,
brookies, lake trout, and landlocked salmon are all supported in
Willoughby. There are some nice guest houses along the east shore
of the lake.
</P>
<P>
   Northern New Hampshire is between two of its early-season
glories. While the salmon run has slowed dramatically in the
Connecticut River in Pittsburg _ as the river has dropped and
slowed _ the watch is on for the large mayfly, Hexagenia limbata,
which are not due for at least a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   When they hit, the fly anglers for whom this part of the world
is trout mecca come off the river and head out onto Back Lake, Lake
Francis, or the largest of the Connecticut Lakes. Salmon and trout
feed voraciously on Hex right into July, when the hatches tail off.
</P>
<P>
   This water system, which make up the headwaters of the 400-mile
Connecticut River, begins just below the Canadian border at Third
Connecticut Lake. (Actually, there is a Fourth Lake, into which
I've trekked only to discover why it is left off most fishing
maps).
</P>
<P>
   This is wonderful destination fishing. There are lodges and
fishing camps with all the ammenities from the town of Pittsburg
around Lake Francis and along Route 3, which heads north to the
First, Second, and Third Lakes, strung together by the river. Also,
check out Back Lake west of Route 3.
</P>
<P>
   There is so much up here that newer anglers are advised to hire
one of the many guides _ you'll see their cards on the notice board
when you stop for coffee at the Pittsburg General Store.
</P>
<P>
   Because the fishing changes from week to week, specific
information is vital. A guide or friend familiar with the region is
advised.
</P>
<P>
   Just below the northern end of New Hampshire are two more
stillwaters that are lovely and well worth the fishing anytime in
spring _ Big Diamond and Little Diamond Ponds.
</P>
<P>
   Reach these by driving Route 26 out of Kidderville (near
Dixville Notch). They are very different waters, Little Diamond a
shallow put-and-take brook trout water where anglers have a limit
of five fish or 5 pounds. The pond is in Coleman State Park, where
there is a boat launch ramp.
</P>
<P>
   If Little Diamond is rarely more than 15 feet deep, Big Diamond
has a maximum depth of more than 110 feet, so there are plenty of
holdover fish to be caught. Trolling is the usual technique _ there
is a launch ramp _ though some shore-casting flyfishers work the
west of the pond in spring.
</P>
<P>
   Route 16 out of the town of Errol brings anglers to a 3-mile
stretch of the Androscoggin River that supports populations of
brookie, brown, and rainbow trout, and salmon. The water is most
accessible from Route 16 down to Mollidgewock Campground, and is
perhaps best fished first at the confluence of Clear Stream
tributary.
</P>
<P>
   Indian and Perry Streams are long tributaries into the
Connecticut water system, and both are stocked with brook trout,
some of them wild. Last season on our trip to the Pittsburg area,
these two streams were among the most productive, hidden, and fun
to fish.
</P>
<P>
   In the lovely Rangeley Lakes region of western Maine, one of the
most overlooked still waters is Aziscohos Lake. While Rangeley Lake
and Mooselookmeguntic are usual destinations in this region,
Aziscohos, a 6,700-acre impoundment on the Magaloway River,
features both stocked and holdover fish.
</P>
<P>
   With good smelt forage, the state now stocks salmon again, after
a moratorium. Stocked and wild brook trout are the other game in
the Aziscohos. The south end has two launch ramps and numerous
campsites. With depths of 60 feet in the south end, fishing remains
strong through the summer and fly-fishing is popular. The season
closes Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Even despite recent development, the Moosehead region of Maine
remains what it always has been, a sportsperson's paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Of the many rivers that flow in and out of the massive,
75,000-acre Moosehead Lake, the Roach River, which enters Spencer
Bay at the northeast corner of the lake, is well worth a trip.
</P>
<P>
   Near the entrance to the lake, the Roach is very fast moving,
especially during rainy springs like this one. There are fish in
the pools behind those rashing riffles, but this section of the
river is very challenging to flycasters.
</P>
<P>
   But late in the season, this stretch does support some very
large salmon along with wild brookies. Perhaps the best first look
is the stretch between First Roach Pond and Lazy Tom Stream. As the
river lowers in the spring, though, more fish are taken in the
section between First Roach and Moosehead.
</P>
<P>
   The Roach can be reached by driving west from Baxter State Park
or north from Greenville on the south shore of Moosehead. While
you're in the neighborhood check out the always breathtaking West
Branch of the Penobscot for large salmon and brown trout. This
river flows north to Chesuncook Lake, with decent access along the
Golden Road, a non-paved logging road.
</P>
<P>
   Maine is so large that its northern reaches stretch more than
100 miles north of New Hampshire and Vermont. So, reaching the
Allagash River and Wilderness Waterway requires a seriously
planned, and perhaps guided, trip. One reaches the river by canoe,
and anglers cast for wild brookies, though fishing is only one of
the attractions of this, one of the most spectacular wilderness
tracts in the country.
</P>
<P>
   June and September are the best months on the river. Fishing
tends to be better in June, but the black flies can be pretty
ferocious. Aside from literature about the region, prospective
anglers should also check out the lengthy canon of fishing
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   And just when you think you've seen the most beautiful wild
place in the Northeast, the 125-mile St. John River creates much of
the border with New Brunswick, from Allagash Village to the Bay of
Fundy. This is wild territory, providing a canoe and fishing
expedition for true getaway aficionados. It does require planning,
permission, and guiding. All details about the St. John or Allagash
can be obtained from the North Maine Woods office at 207-435-6213.

PROMISING E-TAILER RUNS INTO A CASH JAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a seat.
</P>
<P>
   Our current tale of Internet capitalism takes a few moments but
involves a theme that should ring a bell: companies that need money
and find it hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture.com, based in Framingham, Mass., has made a name for
itself in the online world as the most popular site by far among a
field of retailers selling furnishings on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The company almost made it as a public company, under the wing
of blue-chip underwriter Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., but timing conspired
against the planned spring offering. As we all know, the public
stock market window slammed shut and that was that.
</P>
<P>
   This was a problem because Furniture.com, though it gets at
least twice as much traffic as its closest online competitor, had
been burning through some serious cash.
</P>
<P>
   Total 1999 losses: $46.5 million. Remaining cash at the end of
the year: $31 million.
</P>
<P>
   The IPO would have raised about $50 million and probably valued
Furniture.com at a minimum of $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   For companies losing money like Furniture.com, that means
raising more cash privately, if you can find it. For later stage
ventures that missed the IPO window, that's no layup.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture.com decided to go back to its existing venture
investors for $40 million or more in a process known as a ``cram
down,'' according to people familiar with the situation. The
typical pitch: Put up more cash or most of your existing equity
position may get washed out.
</P>
<P>
   Companies running cram downs do so by assessing painfully low
valuations on their own existing stock, so the new round of
financing buys a big percentage of the business. Existing private
investors can step up and maintain their interest or lose out.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture.com, estimated to be worth at least $200 million when
it was trying to launch an IPO a couple of months ago, now carries
a valuation of $10 million in its latest financing efforts, we are
told. Add recast employee options and the number probably rises to
$20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture.com has not been able to close on the cram down so
far. President Andrew Brooks insists the company's capital-raising
activity is simply a work in progress and doesn't reflect any kind
of problem.
</P>
<P>
   The company's venture investors include big names like CMGI's
(at)Ventures and Bessemer Venture Partners. Brooks singled out
(at)Ventures in particular as having ``really shown leadership in
terms of the process of raising this next round of financing.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Brooks said customer orders at Furniture.com
increased to $19.6 million in the first quarter of this year, up 46
percent from the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Funiture.com attracted nearly 1.1 million unique visitors in
March, double the figure for second-place Living.com., according to
online traffic tracker MediaMetrix Inc. Goodhome.com, the
third-place competitor, attracted 377,000 unique visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Furniture.com's cash jam, people familiar with all of
the online furniture retailers say competitors may have even bigger
problems. Some have cash but not enough customers. Others are
lugging big contingent liabilities as a result of partnerships with
retailing portals like Amazon.com.

<P>
   A more interesting story of diverging paths: Furniture.com and
MotherNature.com, the online health products retailer based in
Concord.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies began to grow from their very earliest roots at
about the same time and have many private venture investors in
common. Three people sit on the boards of both companies, including
MotherNature chief executive Michael Barach.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when both companies were still quite green, they were
approached about going public. MotherNature decided to take the
money while it could get it, accepting a second-tier underwriter as
the trade-off. Furniture.com chose to wait for its business to
mature a bit and the chance to go public with Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Now MotherNature has money, but a public stock that has plunged
86 percent since its December IPO. Furniture.com never got through
the stock market door and must pull off its current private
financing effort.
</P>
<P>
   Which decision worked best? We don't think the answer is in yet.
The tougher question: Does either have a chance to end up a winner?

MEDICAL SCHOOL HOLDS FIRM ON CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Saying that Harvard Medical School ``is
taking the high road,'' its dean has turned aside mounting pressure
from his faculty members to liberalize rules on how much they may
own in stock or reap in consulting fees.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Joseph B. Martin's decision Thursday cut short an 18-month
internal debate that many expected would result in relaxing the
medical school's conflict-of-interest rules for researchers after a
faculty meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of a 16-member Harvard committee deliberating on
the issue said the dean told them he had been sobered by his
close-up view of a recent case at the University of Pennsylvania
involving the death of a young volunteer in a gene therapy
experiment. In that case, the head of Penn's gene therapy center
was also a founder and stockholder of the biotech company
sponsoring the human trial.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was a member of a panel whose hard-hitting report on the
Penn case was issued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Martin canceled a June 1 meeting of Harvard faculty
members and called for a national debate on the proper limits on
financial conflict of interest for medical researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he put in place what he called unique new rules
designed to protect medical students and postgraduate trainees from
exploitation by mentors who have financial interest in companies
that sponsor research in their Harvard laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the most important role academic medicine can
have in clinical research today is to try to bolster the public's
faith in the veracity and ethical underpinnings of this noble
endeavor,'' Martin wrote in a memo to Harvard Medical School's
faculty members.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, the dean said that maintaining Harvard's
current strictures on the medical faculty _ the tightest of any
major US academic research institution _ ``is the right thing to
do, the responsible thing to do at this juncture.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard medical faculty members currently cannot conduct
research for a company in which they own more than $20,000 in stock
or receive more than $10,000 in fees or royalties, and rules on
research involving human subjects are even more stringent.
</P>
<P>
   A committee assembled by Martin in the fall of 1998 recommended
months ago that Harvard medical faculty be able to own somewhat
larger amounts of stock, or be paid higher consultant fees, and
still do company-sponsored research in their academic labs.
</P>
<P>
   Martin did not rule out a liberalization of research rules in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the right decision in substance and in timing,''
said David Korn of the Association of American Medical Colleges,
who was to appear at next week's Harvard faculty meeting. ``I was
going to argue at the June 1 meeting that even if there were
reasonable grounds to changing the rules, this was absolutely not
the time for Harvard Medical School to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's unexpected action was immediately applauded by leaders
of academic medicine, who predicted it should have a bracing effect
on those who argue that conflict-of-interest policies should be
strengthened to protect those who volunteer for research and to
prevent bias in reporting research results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard is the anchor of academic medicine,'' said Dr. Kenneth
Shine, president of the National Institute of Medicine, an arm of
the congressionally chartered National Academy of Sciences. ``I
suspect we'll see more institutions move toward the Harvard model
as opposed to away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted,'' added Dr. Marcia Angell, editor-in-chief of
the New England Journal of Medicine. ``I was concerned that Harvard
was going to relax its guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin alluded to a series of cases around the nation in which
major research institutions have been found to violate rules
governing protection of human subjects.
</P>
<P>
   One such case involved a gene therapy experiment with heart
patients at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Boston. In the Penn
and Boston cases, along with more than a half-dozen others, federal
authorities temporarily halted those experiments _ and sometimes
suspended entire institutions' federal grants.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said such events did not determine his decision to retain
Harvard's strict rules, but did ``make Harvard's position more
visible.'' He also noted that Harvard Medical School's 6,000
full-time faculty members were split on the issue, a factor he
called ``the most troublesome thing'' about relaxing
conflict-of-interest rules at this time.
</P>
<P>
   The only modification Martin made in the current rules involves
new protections for medical students and trainees whose faculty
mentors have financial interests in the outcome of experiments in
the academic laboratories they run.
</P>
<P>
   The new rule specifies that trainees must be informed of
mentors' financial interests. Mentors must obtain written approval
before trainees can be assigned to projects in which the mentor has
a financial interest. There is a new appeals process for trainees
who feel wronged by situations involving mentors' conflict of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really the issue here is the relative powerlessness of PhD
students and postdocs in laboratories,'' said Nikki Zapol, director
of corporate-sponsored research at Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Zapol said the new Harvard policy may have grown out of an
episode involving her son, David, a former postdoctoral student at
a West Coast university. His father, Harvard anesthesiology
professor Warren M. Zapol, described the case in a letter to the
Harvard committee reviewing conflict-of-interest rules.
</P>
<P>
   David Zapol's mentor was a founder and stockholder of a startup
biotech company based on work in the mentor's laboratory, his
parents said.
</P>
<P>
   ``David discovered that results . . . from his own experiments
were being siphoned off to the company, appearing in company
studies and presentations before David had published them,'' Warren
Zapol wrote to the Harvard committee. The postdoctoral student
feared that his mentor would direct company personnel to ``carry
out work which would preempt David's PhD thesis.''
</P>
<P>
   David Zapol abandoned his PhD studies after the mentor and the
West Coast university ignored David Zapol's pleas, his parents
said.

WASHING MACHINE NO LONGER REMOVES SOAP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 28, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  Our washing machine is 13 years old and is no longer
rinsing soap completely out of the clothes. Is this a problem of
the water or the soap, or is it time for a new machine?
</P>
<P>
   GINNY LAIRD, Easton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  There's something wrong with the spin dryer that squeezes
out the rinse water, or the pump. Call an appliance repair person
who will service any brand. He may find something simple and
inexpensive. If the repair is expensive ($100 or more), consider a
new washing machine. Your machine is two years beyond its life
expectancy of 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  My stucco house on the water in mid-coast Maine is peeling,
and needs to be painted. The painter who painted the house about 10
years ago said he'd scrape, and paint with latex paint. Is latex
the best to use on stucco?
</P>
<P>
   BILL COLCORD, Out there somewhere
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  Any latex is OK to use on stucco. Be careful scraping it,
and perhaps wire brushing might be better than scraping to get the
loose paint off. Once everything is done and clean, use two thin
coats of a latex house paint. Or, perhaps better, two thin coats of
a latex solid color stain. No primer is needed in either case.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  The landscape timber walls of my large planters have been
eaten by insects. I would like to put some concrete blocks in front
of the decyed timbers to create a bigger planter, but without
taking out the timbers, which will evewntully rot away. Would that
work?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN KINGSLEY, Westborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  I think it will work quite well, allowing bigger planters
without taking out all that earth. I suggest you install concrete
retaining wall blocks, which are designed to hold back earth, are
permanent, and look very good.
</P>
<P>
   If you saw insects in the timbers, make sure they (possibly
termites) do not get into the house. Or, if they are carpenter
ants, they nested in the wood, not eating it, but could find some
good wood in the house to nest in. Make sure they did not. If you
saw no insects, the timbers may have decayed simply from a fungus
or other non-insect organism.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  I am redoing my bathroom, with is 89 inches wide and 99
inches long. When I say redoing, it means gutting everything to the
studs and joists, new everything, including tile around the tub,
and all new fixtures. I got a bid of $12,000. Is that reasonable or
not?
</P>
<P>
   LOUISE KILROY, Quincy, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  That's reasonable. Any other bids you might get are likely,
in my opinion, to be higher. With a bid like that, make sure the
fixtures are of the quality that you like.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  I had a nice wood exterior door installed with a storm that
is one large piece of glass. I would like to finish it, and I like
the idea of the gel urethane. Would that work?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN PRICE, Peabody, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  Yes, it should, if not sun hits the storm or door. Make
sure that gel urethane is for exterior use. But I think spar or
marine varnish would better. Three thin coats should give you
pretty good service. But if the door gets half a day or more, of
sun, I don't think the varnish will stand up for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  My end table has a leather insert. I put some plants on it,
causing a white water stain on the leather. Old Craftsman's spot
remover took some of the stain off, but not all. How can I get the
remainder off the leather?
</P>
<P>
   HELEN O'BRIEN, Somerville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  Sometimes saddle soap will do it, but Apple Polishers of
Stow, Vt., makers of leather care products, took me to task when I
suggested anything but their products. That's OK with me; their
products will be probably be safe. Call 978-562-4333 or
800-800-5803.
</P>
<P>
   And, this too might work. Rub the stain lightly with a
toothpaste (not gel). But very lightly. Then apply a leather
conditioner, one of the Apple Polishers products.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  Do you have a list of good stucco people? I cannot find
any. And is there a way for the homeowner to patch stucco?
</P>
<P>
   LIAM VESELY, Sudbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  Check the Yellow Pages under ``Stucco &AMP; Exterior Coating
Contractors'' and ``Stucco Mfrs. &AMP; Distrs.'' Several are listed.
</P>
<P>
   To make a patch, apply wire lath to the wall if there is no lath
in place; this is the best way for stucco to stick. Apply a coat of
a concrete mix (Sakrete makes one; just add water), wait 15
minutes, rub it with a wood float (a wood trowel), which produces
the rough finish of stucco. To reduce cracking, apply concrete in
two thin layers instead of one.

VOTE WILL DETERMINE FUTURE OF PEACE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND

<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Members of the 870-strong ruling
council of the Ulster Unionist party will convene here Saturday for
a crucial vote that will either give new life to the Northern
Ireland peace accord or likely finish it off.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome will turn on whether the pro-British party, whose
longtime slogan was ``Ulster says no,'' retreats to its
rejectionist past and renounces the current formula for stabilizing
the volatile sectarian politics of Ulster or follows the lead of
its moderating leader, David Trimble, who is proposing a future
based on a risk-taking accommodation with the pro-Irish republican
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, said Friday that he did not
want to characterize the balloting as a ``back me or sack me''
vote, but that if he is defeated, his five-year-old leadership is
almost certainly over.
</P>
<P>
   He is asking his party to accept an Irish Republican Army offer
to permit inspections of its secret arms dumps as a credible
disarmament move justifying the Ulster Unionists' return to
participation in home rule government with Sinn Fein, the political
representatives of the IRA. If he prevails, the currently suspended
Northern Ireland Assembly will be back up and running by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble succeeded last November in persuading his quarrelsome
party, the province's largest Protestant group, to begin joint rule
with its Catholic rivals in Sinn Fein, but that power-sharing
government was put on hold by the British in February, after only
nine weeks, when the IRA failed to make expected companion moves on
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   On May 6, the IRA announced it would let international
inspectors monitor its hidden arsenals and said it would
``completely and verifiably put IRA arms beyond use.'' The
statement came at a time of deepening gloom among peace negotiators
and lifted hopes that a stalemate over guerrilla disarmament that
had blocked progress in the peace settlement had been broken.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists have long said that they would not go into
government with Sinn Fein without assurances that its IRA allies
would disarm. Trimble says he believes the new action by the IRA
constitutes that assurance. His opponents, who have maintained a
stance they call ``no guns, no government,'' say it does not.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, both sides have campaigned feverishly,
employing door-to-door visits, telephone banks and province-wide
leafletting. At issue is whether enough Ulster Unionists can be
persuaded to give Trimble the benefit of a doubt a second time. He
called off a meeting originally scheduled for last Saturday when he
saw that his cause was losing at that point.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-agreement faction has broadened its demands for
concessions, reviving past ties to cherished symbols of national
identity. The debate that had been confined to weapons now turns on
additional issues like whether the British or Irish flag flies
above government buildings, the name for the new police force and
what emblems appear on police badges and caps.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly sensitive is the matter of what to call the Royal
Ulster Constabulary, the 93 percent Protestant police force that
enjoys little trust from Catholics and whose initials, R.U.C.,
feature in most of the graffiti scrawled on walls in their
neighborhoods. An international commission headed by former Hong
Kong Gov. Chris Patten recommended a new force with more balanced
recruitment and the name Northern Ireland Police Service, but the
hard-liners are insisting that the R.U.C. title be kept.
</P>
<P>
   A Belfast Telegraph poll showed Thursday that more than 70
percent of unionists favor Trimble's proposal, but the makeup of
the council is more hard-line than the Protestant population as a
whole. Trimble is planning reforms to do away with block votes on
the council held by a militant youth wing and the traditional
Orange Order, but he has not been able to do so in time to affect
Saturday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   The rejectionist group is led openly by his most forceful
opponent in the party, Jeffrey Donaldson, 37, a member of
parliament who has coveted Trimble's leadership position and
appears to be seizing his chance now to wrest it away. He plans to
introduce an alternative proposal demanding IRA disarmament at
Saturday's meeting as a way of combating Trimble's claim that there
is no alternative to his own plan.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble has lost the support of some of the people who voted
with him in November, but he has also picked up backing in
surprising places.
</P>
<P>
   Sean O'Callaghan, a convicted former IRA killer turned informer,
told unionist gatherings this week that he was convinced that the
IRA's new pledge constituted the long awaited pledge from the
republican side that ``the war is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 3,600 people have died in the past three decades in that
war, and the peace agreement, struck in April 1998 but still not
fully in place, was an effort to balance the interests of
pro-British Protestants and pro-Irish Catholics and turn their
dispute from a violent one into a political one.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have now is the best possible agreement on weaponry
that we could have achieved,'' O'Callaghan said. ``I believe it is
an offer that unionists in Northern Ireland would be mad to turn
down.''

&HT;     MUSTANG GT APPEALS TO BOOMERS AND THEIR CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's face it.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is quite as exhilarating as driving along winding
country roads in a convertible with a big V-8 engine and the top
down.
</P>
<P>
   And almost nothing is quite like the 2000 Mustang GT convertible
to take on just such a drive.
</P>
<P>
   With all the retro-look cars that have come on the market
lately, such as the Plymouth Prowler, Chrysler PT Cruiser and
Volkswagen New Beetle, nothing is quite as authentic for
nostalgia's sake as the current Mustang.
</P>
<P>
   It has always been, and I hope always will continue to be, a
throwback to the late '60s, when muscle cars were king of the road,
and the Mustang led the pack.
</P>
<P>
   People like the Mustang; more than 6.9 million have been sold
since the car debuted at the 1964 New York World's Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, at middle age I felt a bit silly sitting down behind
the wheel of a zinc-yellow Mustang GT with boy-racer black stripes
and the big ``GT'' letters on the hood.
</P>
<P>
   This is a car for boys who are still trying to impress those
impressionable teen-age girls, and whose driving skills might or
might not be quite up to the car's power and performance.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, I instantly felt about 30 years younger as I fired up
the GT's 260-horsepower, 4.6-liter V-8, lowered the top, fastened
my seatbelt, and eased it (well, not really _ gunned it) onto the
nearest freeway.
</P>
<P>
   I had a girl at my side _ my own 16-year-old daughter _ who was
duly impressed with the car, and the fact that her old man could:
a) drive it as well as one of her young, male schoolmates, and b)
seem to enjoy it as much, too.
</P>
<P>
   She, of course, grooved on the GT (do they say ``grooved''
anymore? Am I truly dating myself here?), and wanted us to take it
on some really neat back roads, which we proceeded to do.
</P>
<P>
   With an eye out for restrictive speed limits, residential areas
and road hazards, we took it through the Texas Hill Country,
winding and weaving along some of the most beautiful roads the Lone
Star State has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cool, really cool roads,'' the teen-ager said. ``And boy, this
car really handles them well!''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. It will as long as those roads aren't wet; if they
get wet, though, it's time to park the Mustang. All that power
going to the rear wheels and those (almost) racing tires can play
havoc with traction.
</P>
<P>
   But wait: For 2000, Ford finally has added traction control to
the Mustang, something that has been needed for years. (The
Connecticut Highway Patrol, which has used Mustang GTs as pursuit
vehicles for years, has had a policy of keeping those vehicles
parked when the roads are wet).
</P>
<P>
   For $230, the traction control can be added to any 2000 Mustang,
and it works at any speed to help limit wheel spin and stabilize
steering on slippery surfaces. The system uses antilock braking
sensors to detect excess drive-wheel spin, then reduces wheel
slippage by retarding ignition timing, reducing fuel flow, and
cutting off cylinders in conjunction with application of individual
wheel brakes.
</P>
<P>
   The driver can turn off the system using a switch on the center
console.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't have the opportunity to drive the GT on any wet roads,
though, so I can't tell you how effective this system is at keeping
the rear wheels in place as the vehicle negotiates turns on
slippery pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Any improvement from the past would be welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Ford mildly restyled the Mustang last year, the first changes
since the current generation of the vehicle made its worldwide
debut at the Texas State Fair in Dallas in fall 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still strongly reminiscent of the Mustangs of the late
'60s, with the longer, rounded hood and beefier appearance than the
original 1964 1/2 model.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Mustangs were introduced when I was in high school,
they hold great nostalgic value for me (and most other baby boomers
who came of age in the '60s). It's nice to know that the current
model holds onto some of the original styling, including the
classic hood and the signature tri-bar taillights.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in last year's changes, the V-8 engine's horsepower was
increased by 35, giving an already zippy car even more go-power.
Torque also was increased slightly, to 302 foot-pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Although the five-speed manual transmission probably offers the
best performance from the V-8 engine, our test car came with the
four-speed automatic gearbox ($815 extra).
</P>
<P>
   It would have been nice to have the option to shift the
automatic transmission manually like the feature that some other
cars with automatics offer, but clutchless manual shifting wasn't
available on the Mustang.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its retro look and feel, the Mustang has lots of modern
features besides the traction control and antilock brakes.
</P>
<P>
   There are second-generation air bags up front, remote keyless
entry, power rack-and-pinion steering, CFC-free air-conditioning,
stainless-steel exhaust, dual power mirrors, power windows and door
locks, leather-wrapped tilt steering wheel, AM/FM/cassette in-dash
stereo with separate in-dash compact-disc player, a power
convertible top (with glass rear window), and illuminated dual
visor mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   Base price of the GT convertible, which includes all of the
above except the automatic transmission and traction control, is
$25,365 plus $575 transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Extras on our test car, besides the transmission and traction
control, included the GT feature package ($995) that added 17-inch
machined-aluminum wheels, Z-rated 17-inch tires (top speed of this
car approaches 150 mph), and the black striping; an upgraded stereo
system ($395); a convenience group ($550) that added front floor
mats, power driver's seat, rear defroster and cruise control; and
leather sport bucket seats ($500).
</P>
<P>
   Total sticker was $29,440, including transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The car seats four people, but the rear seat is a bit cramped
for adults.
</P>
<P>
   It does have the new permanent anchoring system for two child
safety seats, though, so the car can accommodate a couple of little
ones.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings for the V-8 with automatic transmission
are 17 miles per gallon in the city and 24 mpg on the highway. But
don't expect to get mileage that high if you have a lead foot. It
just won't happen.
</P>
<P>
   The tank holds 15.7 gallons of gasoline.

ROUTED IN LEBANON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no putting a pretty face on Israel's humiliating rout
in southern Lebanon last week, but that didn't stop Prime Minister
Ehud Barak from trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel's presence in Lebanon tied its hands to some extent,''
he declared Thursday. ``But from now on, there are no limits on a
tough Israeli response to all aggression against it.'' The day
before, he boasted that the troops had departed Lebanon ``without a
scratch.'' This, he said, ``is a happy day.''
</P>
<P>
   A happy day?
</P>
<P>
   Pursued by a few hundred Hezbollah guerrillas, Israeli soldiers
flee Lebanon in a panic. In their haste to get out, they leave
behind armored vehicles, rocket launchers, and ammunition, which
the Shiite militiamen chasing them promptly seize. ``As they
giddily rode abandoned Israeli tanks through village after
village,'' The New York Times reports on Page 1 the next morning
alongside a photo of triumphant Islamist fighters, ``they laid
waste to Israel's plan for an orderly, scheduled withdrawal.''
Meanwhile mortars are fired at the towns of the Upper Galilee;
residents are forced to sleep in bomb shelters. Vowing to
``continue fighting as if there had been no withdrawal at all,''
Hezbollah sweeps down to the Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' gloats Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader,
``is the first victory in 50 years of Arab-Israeli conflict!'' If
he means that it is the first time that Israel has been forced to
retreat, with no peace agreement or security guarantee, from
territory it had occupied in self-defense, he is entirely correct.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the worst of it.
</P>
<P>
   With Israel out, Syria's hegemony over Lebanon is complete. The
tens of thousands of Syrian troops who for 25 years have occupied
the northern two-thirds of the country are now free to extend their
control over all of it.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's deployment of surface-to-air missile batteries in
Lebanon was one of the events that triggered Israel's invasion in
1982. With Hezbollah _ protected by Syria, financed by Iran _ once
more at Israel's door, how long will it be before such threatening
moves resume? As Israel cut and ran last week, Lebanese radio
hinted at the bloodshed to come. ``Yarun is now liberated,'' one
broadcaster said, ``and I'm looking over into occupied Palestine.''
That is, into northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Even that is not the worst of it.
</P>
<P>
   The worst _ the very worst _ is that in its rush to leave
Lebanon, Israel left its Christian and moderate Muslim allies in
the South Lebanon Army to the tender mercies of Hezbollah and
Damascus. Within hours, the ``ethnic cleansing'' had reportedly
begun. In Qolaia, two Christian men were said to have been
kidnapped and executed by the militiamen. In Marjayoun, homes were
torched; in Burj el-Mluk and Kawkaba, churches. The Orthodox bishop
of Marjayoun and the Maronite bishop of Sidon pleaded publicly for
help in stopping the ``acts of persecution and aggression taking
place.''
</P>
<P>
   For 25 years, at great risk to themselves, the men of the SLA
helped keep Israel's northern towns safe from terrorism. The
enclave they patrolled was the closest thing Lebanon had to a free
zone, a small swath of territory not dominated by Syria or Shi'ite
extremists. Israelis are famous for never leaving a man behind. But
they left these men behind, and it is a betrayal many will not
survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I stay in the village, the Hezbollah will slaughter me,''
an SLA veteran-turned-refugee, one of 6,000 southern Lebanese who
sought safe haven in Israel, told a reporter. ``If I flee to
Beirut, they'll slaughter me in Beirut.''
</P>
<P>
   Another refugee, an officer in the SLA for 24 years who had been
compelled to escape without his family, was frightened, too _ but
not for himself. ``I can't stop thinking about what Hezbollah men
will do to our daughters and wives. They know who I am, and they're
certain to search for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The message to Israel's supporters last week was that the Jewish
state cannot be trusted to stand by those who stand by it. That is
not a good reputation to have anywhere _ especially not in a
neighborhood as dangerous as Israel's. If the Israelis were
determined to withdraw from Lebanon unilaterally, they had a moral
obligation to make sure their friends in the SLA knew what was
coming and could defend themselves _ not to scurry out pell-mell,
with barely a word of warning to the courageous Lebanese Christians
and Muslims whose steadfastness through the years had saved so many
Jewish lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli flight from Lebanon took place nearly 60 years to
the day after the desperate Allied escape from the beaches of
Dunkirk. Unlike Barak, Winston Churchill did not proclaim that
frantic retreat before the Nazis a ``happy day'' or boast of having
gotten the troops out ``without a scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wars are not won by evacuations,'' he told the Commons. ``Our
thankfulness at the escape of our Army . . . must not blind us to
the fact that what has happened . . . is a colossal military
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak is no Churchill. More is the pity for Israel.

&HT;     NOT ALL SPORTY CARS BREAK THE BANK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's easy to lust after exotic cars such as the
half-million-dollar Ferrari or Lamborghini, the $130,000
Mercedes-Benz SL600 convertible, the $82,000 Jaguar XKR
convertible, or even the more realistically priced Chevrolet
Corvette soft-top, at just over $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, let's face it. Most of us can't afford any of these
cars.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most of us can't even afford fun and sporty vehicles
such as the cheapest of the BMW Z3 roadsters, at $31,300, or
something as much fun as, say, the Audi TT coupe, with its $30,000
price tag, or the Ford Mustang GT convertible, which rings in at
nearly $26,000 before any extras are tacked on.
</P>
<P>
   Don't despair. You really don't need megabucks to buy a car that
has some zip, looks really cool, and is truly fun to drive.
</P>
<P>
   Some automakers are aware of our plight, and are making sure we
have a chance to own affordable yet sporty cars that put smiles on
our faces as we cruise down city streets or along country roads.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the rich folks don't hold the franchise on fun;
it's there for the taking for any of us who can afford to buy a new
car at or below _ even well-below _ the current average price of
new cars, $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   You need cruise no farther than any of your local Ford,
Chevrolet or Pontiac dealerships to find the first of the
affordable sporty cars that come to mind: the Ford Mustang,
Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird.
</P>
<P>
   These cars thrive today in part because baby boomers who came of
age in the 1960s are on a nostalgia binge, trying to re-create
their childhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just us 40- or early-50-somethings who are gobbling
up Camaros, Firebirds and Mustangs; kids coming of age seem to like
them just as much as we did. It's not uncommon to see folks with
gray hair shopping for these cars with their teen-age children in
tow, being egged on by said teens as they consider buying such
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   At dealership after dealership, Camaros, Firebirds and Mustangs
were priced not in the low- to mid-$20,000s, but way down in the
mid- to upper-teens. Yep, that's right. There is a good selection
in the $16,500 to $19,000 range on many Chevy, Ford and Pontiac
lots.
</P>
<P>
   OK, these aren't the hottest of these cars on the market. For
these affordable prices, you won't get a V-8 engine or even a
convertible top. But the V-6 power in these cars _ 3.8 liters and
190 horsepower for the Mustangs; 3.8 liters and 200 hp for the
Camaros and Firebirds _ is plenty of power for most of our needs.
Even without a V-8 engine, these cars are plenty fun to drive.
</P>
<P>
   If you can afford to break the $20,000 barrier, but still must
stay below $25,000, you can opt for a soft top on any of these
cars.
</P>
<P>
   The V-6 Mustang convertible lists for $21,370, and even with a
few popular options _ such as automatic transmission and cruise
control _ you can buy a Mustang convertible for about $23,000.
</P>
<P>
   A well-equipped V-6 Camaro convertible lists for $24,140, but
with readily available dealer discounts, that can be trimmed by
$1,500 or more.
</P>
<P>
   The Firebird convertible lists for just over $25,000, but can be
bought for less if you take the time to shop for a good price.
</P>
<P>
   These pony-car derivatives do have drawbacks. For those of us
with families _ who need four doors and at least a marginally
comfortable back seat _ two-door Mustangs, Camaros and Firebirds
are out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   But don't let the dreaded ``S'' word _ sedan _ scare you into
believing you can't have fun and carry your family everywhere with
you at the same time. Fun sedans are on the market. No kidding! And
they can be had for under $25,000 and, in some cases, way under.
</P>
<P>
   One excellent choice is the Pontiac Grand Prix GT four-door
sedan, carrying a list price of about $21,500, which can be
whittled down under $20,000 with shrewd negotiating or careful
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you can't bring yourself to buy a sedan, you can put the
kiddies _ even big ones _ in the back seat of the Grand Prix GT
two-door coupe, and they'll have plenty of room for their legs.
</P>
<P>
   The GT comes with a 3.8-liter, 200-horsepower engine (just like
the Camaro and Firebird). But if you really want to rock and roll,
upgrade to the GTP model, which lists for just over $24,000 (coupe
or sedan), and you'll get that same 3.8-liter engine with a
supercharger, boosting it to a truly fun 240 horsepower. Wow!
</P>
<P>
   Compact sedans, the stalwart of the economically challenged
family, can actually be exciting, too.
</P>
<P>
   You've heard of the Pontiac Grand Am, of course. It's the
best-selling domestic compact on the market, and it comes with a
modest 150-horsepower four-cylinder engine. But forget the
four-cylinder, and snag a Grand Am GT, priced just under $20,000,
equipped with a 3.4-liter V-6 that cranks out 170 horsepower and
195 foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   Ford isn't to be outdone in this class. If you want sporty fun
in an affordable four-door compact, check out the Contour SVT. That
moniker designates this car as a product of Ford's special vehicle
team, whose job it is to take an average product and make it into
something, well, special.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the 170-horsepower, 2.5-liter V-6 in the standard
Contour, the SVT comes with a 195-horsepower version of this
engine. It has a stiffer suspension and much better road handling
abilities than the base car, and the list price is $22,715.
</P>
<P>
   There are more sporty cars to choose from at affordable prices
if you can do with two doors and a smallish back seat.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is the completely redesigned 2000 Toyota Celica,
which comes with a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine. There are two
versions; to get the sportiest one, opt for the GT-S, with 180
horsepower (compared with 140 hp in the base car) and 140
foot-pounds of torque. The list price is just over $21,000.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi's Eclipse GT, though, can leave the Celica GT-S in
its dust.
</P>
<P>
   The Eclipse GT comes with a 3.0-liter V-6 engine rated at 205
horsepower and 205 foot-pounds of torque. A well-equipped Eclipse
GT lists for about $21,000, and it has some of the best
road-handling attributes in this vehicle class.
</P>
<P>
   Honda sells its sporty Prelude for about $23,500, with a
200-horsepower engine and five-speed manual transmission, or about
$24,500 with automatic transmission and 195 horsepower. But rear
seat room is quite limited.
</P>
<P>
   Two sporty, if not speedy, affordable convertibles on the market
include the Mazda Miata two-seat roadster, whose price begins at
$21,245, and the Volkswagen Cabrio, starting at just under $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Miata has a 140-horsepower four-cylinder engine that offers
decent performance, whereas the Cabrio's performance is a bit
challenged with its 115-horsepower four-cylinder engine. Yet both
cars are lots of fun on warm, sunny days with the top down.
</P>
<P>
   For those who need a truly affordable new car with some measure
of sportiness, Hyundai offers its redesigned Tiburon compact
hatchback for 2000, bearing a rather impressive 140-horsepower
2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and fresh styling that looks
something like the much more expensive Audi TT.
</P>
<P>
   The price? $14,000 for the model with manual transmission, and
under $15,000 with automatic. It comes with the best new-car
warranty in the business, too _ the drivetrain (engine and
transmission) is covered for up to 10 years.

   What is the world's best-selling car ever?
</P>
<P>
   Most of us have a favorite or two we think ought to be on that
list, but to make such a list, the car would have to be a
mass-market vehicle rather than just a niche car such as the
Chevrolet Corvette, America's sports car.
</P>

   Some good guesses would be the Ford Mustang, Chevrolet Cavalier,
Chevrolet Bel Air, (the original) Chevy Nova or even the Ford
Taurus.
</P>
<P>
   But the winner, in a news flash announced recently by Toyota, is
the compact Toyota Corolla.
</P>
<P>
   And the car it unseated as the world's best-selling car of all
time is one that we all perhaps should have guessed: the Volkswagen
Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   To date, since introduction in 1966, there have been more than
24 million Corollas sold worldwide. And that doesn't include about
a million Corollas made at the New United Motor Manufacturing Inc.
plant in Fremont, Calif., which were labeled as Geo Prizm,
Chevrolet Prizm or Chevy Nova (the later version).
</P>
<P>
   That compares with about 23 million Beetles sold (not counting
the New Beetle, which is a completely different animal).
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the original Beetle were discontinued about 1977 in the
United States, but production and sales of the vehicle continue in
South America, and that car was built and sold in Mexico into the
mid-90s.
</P>
<P>
   Its demise in the United States came as a result of safety and
anti-smog requirements that would have been too expensive and
impractical to meet.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota hasn't had that problem with the Corolla, which has been
continually upgraded over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The latest generation, the 2001 model, is arriving at U.S.
dealerships now, and it has been extensively restyled.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a real exciting car to have as the world's all-time
best-seller, but it has been a very good car over the years _ one
that people have come to depend on for long-term, dependable and
affordable transportation. And in the long run, those attributes
are the ones that really count with consumers.

   ATTENTION EDITORS: The following interview with Riccardo Muti
(music director of La Scala opera house in Milan, Italy), who is a
top candidate to become the next music director for the New York
Philharmonic, can be purchased _ the rate is not prohibitive _ by
contacting a New York Times Syndicate salesperson. For purchase
information, see end of text. 
 By KELLY BURKE  
 c.2000 The Sydney Morning Herald  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time Riccardo Muti reaches Sydney in September, the world
will have an answer to the question that America's music
cognoscenti have been speculating over for months.
</P>
<P>
   Will he or won't he take up the baton of the New York
Philharmonic, when the prestigious orchestra's music director, Kurt
Masur, stands down in 2002?
</P>
<P>
   If the United States shared Australia's passion for gambling,
those following the succession saga would have to put the odds at
2-1. As Muti is the obvious front-runner for the job and happens to
be the personal choice of the musicians themselves, it seems likely
all roads will lead to New York for the 58-year-old Italian
maestro.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on the telephone from his home base of Milan recently,
Muti wasn't denying his aspirations. But no contract had been
signed, he assured. Yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a love affair,'' he said, in his trademark style: equal
part arrogance, equal part charm. ``But it is not yet a marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   As music director of La Scala for the past 14 years, Muti's
subsequent enthronement at the New York Philharmonic would fulfill
the conductor's lifelong ambition: to follow in the footsteps of
the man whose legend he worships, Arturo Toscanini.
</P>
<P>
   And now twice wounded in his bid to seize control of the Berlin
Philharmonic, first by the fellow countryman he detests, Claudio
Abbado, and then by Berlin's decision to appoint Simon Rattle as
successor, the $2 million annual salary Muti is rumored to be
negotiating would help the healing process.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to discussing money, Muti will have no such
crudities. ``This is just gossip,'' he says. ``The salary is not
the point. I don't need to make money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are strong possibilities I will sign, but of course it
depends on the details because I do not want to leave La Scala,''
he says. ``So if I take the orchestra, it would have to be with La
Scala, not instead of La Scala.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's the rub. Muti is not about to sacrifice a long love
affair with Italy's glorious opera house for the sake of a New York
dalliance; despite the chemistry that sparked last year when the
Italian made his long-overdue debut with the notoriously
temperamental orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the days of Leonard Bernstein had the orchestra
apparently developed such an instant attraction to a conductor.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling was mutual. But while Muti is assured of the
musicians' support and respect, these vital prerequisites for a
happy marriage between music director and orchestra will in no way
assuage other difficulties the conductor encountered in an earlier
American relationship, with the Philadelphia Orchestra during the
1970s. Muti's vulnerability to jet lag and an open distaste for
kowtowing to the philanthropic socialites who oil the financial
cogs of America's major orchestras and opera companies may make his
stint in New York, should he choose to take the mission, a rocky
one.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Muti is incapable of flexibility or even, on occasion,
compromise, as his recent handling of La Scala's partial
privatization proved.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1997, La Scala received 80 percent of its income from
government sources. With the opera house's conversion to a
nonprofit foundation, that shrunk to 60 percent, with business and
philanthropic funding making up the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Muti welcomed the move toward partial
privatization. But he tempered his optimism with a warning to the
multinationals jostling for a place on the new board: stay off the
delineated artistic turf of my opera house.
</P>
<P>
   Three years on, Muti remains satisfied with the level of
separation between the artistic and business arms of La Scala Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment I call La Scala a happy island,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, La Scala is an island. No other opera house comes
close to rival the style and drama on or off the stage that is La
Scala. Only the Oscars bunfight or a Cannes Film Festival premiere
can compare with the circus that takes place every December 7 when
La Scala opens its new season. And no other opera house has the
luxury of approaching its box-office health with such sanguinity.
That La Scala will be booked out for every performance _ be it
Verdi or Poulenc _ is a given.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also a house where the audience has no sacred cows. If
it does not like what it hears, it is vocal in its disapproval, as
Luciano Pavarotti discovered to his mortification during a 1992
production of Verdi's ``Don Carlo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we do have a very difficult public, but this is good,''
Muti says. ``Certainly it is a public which does not sleep. People
experience the music like a passion for life. Sometimes here it is
a question of life or death. But it makes everything very exciting,
you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet La Scala's resistance to change can be a mixed blessing.
Like the Vienna Staatsoper, it has defied all attempts to install
surtitles. It has also resisted the trend toward director-led
opera. The cult of regis is anathema to Muti.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the music there is already the idea of what should be a
dramatic realization ... a director's job is to visually put the
musical ideas of the conductor on the stage, that is all,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   It is an ethos Muti has stuck to from an extraordinarily young
age; from when the Neapolitan-born Milan Conservatory graduate
first took over the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino in 1969 at the age
of 28.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 30 years at the top of his profession, Muti comes
to a remarkably simple conclusion on the nature of opera: ``There
is no such thing as a conservative production or a modern
production. A production is simply either stupid or intelligent.''

<P>
   It comes up in every meeting,'' said Jeffrey Applegate, chief
U.S. strategist at Lehman Brothers. ``Jeff, what is the risk of a
hard landing?''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Galvin, chief investment officer at Donald Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, and Douglas Cliggott, U.S. equity strategist at J.P.
Morgan Securities, are both hearing the same question, one that has
been popping up in client meetings since the Federal Reserve raised
its short-term interest rate target by half a percentage point, to
6.5 percent on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing minority that believes the Fed could prove
to be too heavy-handed, too aggressive,'' said Galvin. ``It's a
question that is being asked a lot more and it makes sense,''
Cliggott added. ``It's going to be tough to land this thing
gently,'' he said, referring to attempts to slow America's rapid
economic growth without triggering a recession.
</P>
<P>
   A recession? Yes, a recession. The mere fact that the big
clients of these equity strategists are asking the question shows
just how quickly the mood in the stock market has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Applegate, Galvin and Cliggott do not think that a recession is
likely, but they acknowledge that the risk has risen. This is
because real signs of inflationary pressures as well as the
refusal, so far, by the American economy to slow down appreciably,
is already forcing the Fed to be aggressive in raising interest
rates. And that just increases the risk of a mistake, that is, a
recession.
</P>
<P>
   This mood change helped fuel the stock market selloff since the
Fed's rate increase. The Nasdaq index is off 9.7 percent since
then, while the Dow Jones industrial average has fallen 3.9 percent
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index has dropped 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Edward McKelvey, senior economist at Goldman Sachs, said the
mood change was ``all rooted in an increasing amount of evidence
that the labor market is too tight for comfort,'' which forced the
Fed to be more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   He said there were two modes that Fed policy makers might be in
when they raise their benchmark federal funds rate on loans between
banks. They might be trying to slow growth to a manageable,
noninflationary pace before inflation becomes a problem. That is
what the Fed did in 1994 and 1995, with its last big series of rate
increases. And it is what the group appears to have aimed for since
last June, with five moderate, quarter-point increases in the Fed
funds rate.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's other mode is to be intent on stamping out rising
inflation, McKelvey said. If the Fed were to enter this mode, he
said, the central bank would probably slow growth to below the 3.5
percent sustainable pace in order to subdue inflation. But that is
risky. McKelvey says that the Fed has never shifted into that mode
without the economy ending up in a recession.
</P>
<P>
   He does not know what mode the Fed is in now. And he speculates
that one would get ``10 different answers'' at the Fed, a reference
to the 10 members of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets
the central bank's interest rate policy.
</P>
<P>
   But McKelvey notes this interesting _ and possibly not
irrelevant _ fact: Since World War II, when the three-month moving
average of the nation's unemployment rate rose more than 0.3
percent, the economy wound up in a recession within a year.
</P>
<P>
   The three-month moving average now is 4.03 percent, down from
4.07 percent the previous three months and the lowest it has been
since February 1970. If this indicator held to historic form, a
move up to 4.4 percent would be a really bad signal.
</P>
<P>
   So, can the policy makers avoid a hard landing and push up the
unemployment rate without tripping into a recession? This expansion
has already broken many rules economists have long lived by. So
maybe this time will be different. Maybe.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Middle East peace process hits the streets
 &HT;    (Eds: This column, which normally moves Mondays, is moving today
to accommodate early Memorial Day deadlines.)
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As thanks for trying _ and trying hard _ to make peace with
Syria and the Palestinians, Israel is being harassed by both. With
putative negotiating partners like this, who needs enemies?
</P>
<P>
   In a perverse way, the latest resort of the notorious
Palestinian street to stones, firebombs, turmoil and the other
familiar civilities of Middle East political discourse is an
encouraging sign _ evidence negotiations with Israel are entering
another crucial stage, perhaps even the end game.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat always winks at _ and may even order _ such
rioting until the casualties and chaos have proved anew the
dangerous itch of Palestinian ``frustration.'' Then he clamps down,
additionally proving anew, too, that only he can control the
menace.
</P>
<P>
   That seems the case again now, and Israel, also following the
script, has temporarily shut down promising off-site negotiations
that were narrowing the negotiating differences.
</P>
<P>
   By increments, something over 95 percent of the Palestinian
population already has come under control of the Palestinian
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The Barak administration had even signaled the potential for a
deal over the hypersensitive issue of Jerusalem, tendering
unilaterally to cede Abu Dis and two other Palestinian villages on
the edge of the city. The offer, now on hold, strongly implied that
any new Palestinian state could claim part of an expanded Jerusalem
as its capital.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Israel's (again) unilateral withdrawal from southern
Lebanon was gratuitously harried by extremist Hezbollah fighters,
unhelpfully undermining, at least with the Israeli population,
another broad gesture toward regional reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Israel blundered in 1982 when, instead of settling for cleaning
out the terrorist ministate Lebanon had been unable to keep from
developing on Israel's northern border, Israel sent its forces
roaring on toward Beirut in hopes of installing a puppet government
that would sign a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has been mired since, and periodically bloodied, in the
narrow, supposed security zone that was all it could maintain
against contrary international pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, with some 35,000 troops stationed there, is the hand
inside the Lebanese glove. When Lebanon's fingers wiggle, it is
Damascus wiggling them. And it is Syria again when those fingers
ball into a fist, as they are doing now.
</P>
<P>
   Syria could have made sure that regular Lebanese army troops
filled the Israeli vacuum in southern Lebanon, a relative
reassurance that the area would not again become a launch site for
attacks on northern Israeli communities.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian President Hafez Assad prefers, for domestic reasons, to
keep the tension taut, even so far snubbing a de facto Israeli
offer to return the Golan Heights to Syria in exchange for full
diplomatic and economic relations_ hard goods for soft.
</P>
<P>
   Still, neither that tension nor the upheavals in the West Bank
mean negotiations are forlorn. In the Middle East, these are the
negotiations.

   People who sell new cars like to start negotiating at the
sticker price. But savvy consumers know that it makes more sense to
bargain up from the invoice, or wholesale, price. If you don't know
the number on the invoice, you're just not trying; the figures are
ubiquitous in car buyers' guides and on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know the invoice price when they start haggling end up
with deals that run $1,700 less, on average, than the salesperson's
first offer, according to a recent Consumer Reports survey.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even more price information is available, thanks to the
Internet, and the invoice is only the visible floor of the deal.
Beneath it are other sources of dealer profit that buyers can try
to tap.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were walking in and saying, `How much over invoice will
you sell me this car for?' and that wasn't getting them the
dealer's best offer,'' said Paige Amidon, director of Consumer
Reports' car price service.
</P>
<P>
   To get an approximation of the dealership's true cost for a
vehicle, one should also take into account two pots of money that
carmakers pay to dealers: sales incentives and holdbacks. By
subtracting these figures from the invoice, one comes closer to the
actual price that the dealer paid for the car.
</P>
<P>
   The holdback is money that is intended to help cover the
dealer's interest expense. Dealers, who must pay for cars when they
are ordered, not when they are sold, carry loans to cover their
inventory. By longstanding arrangement, most carmakers pay dealers
a percentage of the invoice price, usually from 2 to 3 percent, to
cover interest charges for the first 90 days. Automakers who pay 3
percent, for example, give a dealer $600 for a car with an invoice
of $20,000. Dealers get the same amount whether the car sells in
three days or three months.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, carmakers offer incentives to dealers just as they
do to consumers to help move sluggish-selling models or to clear
out inventories. If, as the 2000 models rolled in, a 1999 model
carried a $1,000 manufacturer rebate for the customer, the older
car might have carried a $1,000 rebate for the dealer, too. These
incentives, for both customers and dealers, usually have expiration
dates.
</P>
<P>
   Dealer incentive information has been available in industry
journals like Automotive News for years, but it is now more
accessible to consumers. Edmunds, a company that has provided
automotive information for decades, has offered incentive and
holdback information without charge on its Web site
(www.edmunds.com) since 1996; those who want to save time seeking
this and other information can get a detailed report on a specific
model for $9.95. This spring, Consumer Reports started including
dealer holdbacks and incentives in calculating the bottom-line
price for a car in its new-car price reports. These sell for $12
each ($10 for additional reports ordered at the same time), and can
be obtained at www.consumerreports.org or by calling (800)
205-2445.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Wells, chairman of the National Automobile Dealers
Association, who is a General Motors and Chrysler dealer in
Whiteville, N.C., reluctantly accepts the reality that more price
information is available to consumers, but laments that too often
customers come in with outdated information. That, he says, adds to
mistrust when salespeople disagree with customers' figures.
</P>
<P>
   The experts agree that you should confirm the pricing as soon as
possible to the time to negotiations, because automakers are
shuffling incentives, prices and even holdback amounts more than
ever in their efforts to grab market share.
</P>
<P>
   How close can you get to this rock-bottom price? Bargaining
skills aside, strong demand keeps prices high. If you want a
popular model, expect to pay sticker price, or close to it. ``But
by showing you are aware of these factors, you can make the process
more businesslike,'' Amidon said. &QL;

 &HT;    FOR U.S. SOLDIERS, KOSOVO PEACEKEEPING IS A DRAG AND AN HONOR
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., May 28 And Thereafter.

<P>
   KAMENICE, Yugoslavia _ The radio crackle broke the late
afternoon stillness across the rolling wheat fields of eastern
Kosovo with bad news for U.S. peacekeeper Lt. Col. Jim Brown: an
81-year-old Serb man had been shot dead by two Albanian suspects.
</P>
<P>
   For Brown, from the Army's 1st Infantry Division, his daily road
patrols as part of NATO's peacekeeping force in Kosovo, called
K-FOR, resembles his usual life as a military police commander at
his home base in Hanau, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing like a history of handling domestic disputes and petty
crime calls for preparing you for a mission as a peacekeeper,'' he
told a visitor, as he turned his three Humvee convoy toward the
town of Kamenice, 23 miles west of the Kosovo-Serbia border, to
investigate the murder.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the 5,500 U.S. soldiers taking part in the
multinational K-FOR force securing peace in the southern Yugoslav
province after last year's bombing campaign aren't cops,
law-enforcement duties comprise most of the day-to-day activities
for troops.
</P>
<P>
   The result is an assignment that U.S. soldiers say is partly a
drag and partly an honor, but typical of the complexities an
American soldier faces during times of peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are contributing to peace here, no doubt about it, so in
that sense we're fulfilling an important mission,'' said Staff Sgt.
Christopher Callan of Newport, R.I. ``But, I was trained as an
infantryman ... not to apprehend robbers or stop traffic accidents,
which is what I do day-to-day in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of repression under Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's government, intense fighting erupted in mid-1998
between the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army and the separatist rebels
of the Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA _ a group of ethnic Albanian
Kosovars fighting to win Kosovo's independence from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav military reprisals aimed at trying to root out the KLA
soon turned to attacks on Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority, and
thousands of people being burned out of their homes by Serb
paramilitary groups. The United States, unable to halt the fighting
during talks with the Milosevic government, last spring led a
devastating 78-day NATO bombing campaign of Yugoslavia, which beat
back the Serb army and allowed hundreds of thousands of Kosovar
Albanians to return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the international community has worked to rebuild
the tattered Kosovo region and repair ethnic relations between
Kosovar Albanians and the minority Serb population. The
39,000-large K-FOR force has been the integral factor in
maintaining peace while the United Nations works to get civic
institutions like the police and judiciary system working.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. forces took command of Kosovo's east region, maintaining
road patrols throughout the hilly territory, foot patrols in each
town and village, and observation and checkpoints along the border
with Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the simmering tensions that still exist in mixed
communities, the U.S. sector has gained a reputation as being one
of the safest in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the sight of a U.S. patrol instantly commands respect
along the dusty streets of Gjilane, a town of 34,000 where Sgt.
Callan's platoon is responsible for maintaining order. Unlike other
NATO countries, U.S. Army regulations call for all patrols to wear
battle helmets and flak jackets and keep their automatic rifles at
the ready while on duty.
</P>
<P>
   Only once has a U.S. patrol come under attack from the local
community. On April 4, a squad of MPs arrived in the village of
Vitina to break up a riot staged by Albanians. The troops waded
into the fray, receiving hits from the crowd armed with sticks and
stones. Ten peacekeepers were injured, none seriously, before they
dispersed the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge disappointment. We spent months building trust,
and we saw it break down that day,'' said Lt. Col. Brown, who was
hit in the back of the head with a piece of wood and almost knocked
out by the blow.
</P>
<P>
   In Gjilane, a town with a mixed population of Serbs and
Albanians, the situation is less tense one year after the U.S.
soldiers arrived. In one neighborhood where Serbs still live next
to Albanians, the U.S. soldiers have nicknamed a road ``Tea
Street,'' because the residents always invite the troops into their
shady yards to drink tea and relax.
</P>
<P>
   On a typical 10-hour patrol, Pvt. Edward Karolasz of Kearny,
N.J., who just completed basic training before shipping out to
Kosovo, says he spends more time high-fiving little kids than
observing crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``They love us. The kids run out an shout 'NA-TO! NA-TO!' as we
walk by. How cool is that?'' Karolasz said.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Callan says one year into the peacekeeping mission, it's
boredom, not violence, that is the biggest threat to his troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a simple routine. We patrol, eat chow, work out, then
do it again the next day,'' he said. ``When we leave here, we are
going to have to spend time relearning some basic skills.''
</P>
<P>
   2nd Lt. Ady(CQ) Velasco, from Las Vegas, says his biggest
complaint is with the leave policy for U.S. soldiers assigned in
Kosovo. Unlike other militaries serving in the NATO-led
peacekeeping mission, American soldiers don't get any leave,
serving for as long as seven months in Kosovo without a break. The
troops are practically confined to the U.S. base, Camp Bondsteel,
and are forbidden from eating in local restaurants or drinking
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We joke there are two prisons in the (U.S.-controlled) East
Sector,'' said Lt. Ian Fitzgerald. ``One is the detention center
for locals who have committed crimes and one is Bondsteel itself.''
</P>
<P>
   While many in Washington dispute whether U.S. soldiers should be
participating in K-FOR, U.S. troops interviewed here last week(CQ)
expressed agreement with the recent vote in the U.S. Senate not to
limit the peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
   K-FOR soldiers act in tandem with the nascent U.N. police force,
made up of officers from U.N. countries as well as local Albanian
and Serb officers. Currently, the police force is only
half-staffed, and K-FOR troops fulfill many tasks the police will
take over in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In the east sector, this transition is underway.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at the scene here in Kamenice where the old man was
murdered, Lt. Col. Brown found the U.N. Police had already handled
the initial investigation and were pursuing two suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Brown described the shooting as an aberration, saying hate
crimes and violent ethnic attacks have dropped considerably over
the last year, mostly due to the fact that a steady trickle of Serb
families have left their homes in eastern Kosovo to live with
relatives to the north in Serbia. This has left fewer targets for
Albanian extremists intent on revenge attacks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Callan says the exodus of Serb communities is an
unfortunate, but highly probable, development in the near future.
While this makes life more peaceful on the streets and for his
patrol, sustained peace, he says, is a long way off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Serbs) feel safe and walk around freely only because we
are here. One year isn't enough to patch things up in this part of
the world. These two communities have enough hate for each other
that if we leave, we'll see war here again.''

 &HT;    NEW CHOICES FACE MIDDLE EAST AFTER ISRAEL'S LEBANON WITHDRAWAL
 &HT;    (1000&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Eight centuries after crusader knights in
armor guarded its thick stone walls, the hilltop Beaufort castle of
southern Lebanon has fallen again.
</P>
<P>
   Beaufort was a mainstay of the Israeli army's two-decades
occupation in southern Lebanon until Wednesday. Now, a Hezbollah
flag flies there.
</P>
<P>
   As with every great turn of the Middle East, there will be new
peril and promise for its sheiks, presidents and generals _ and for
the envoys there from the West.
</P>
<P>
   United Nations troops moved into the south Friday to help ensure
order. They also began checking maps to see if Israel's withdrawal
was complete.
</P>
<P>
   They say Lebanon will support their ruling, important because
Lebanon so far still claims ownership of an Israeli-held piece of
unpopulated land, the Chibaa Farms.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal was a campaign promise of Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak. But prompted by the collapse of the South Lebanon Army,
which Israel had paid to be its barrier against the hostile local
population, the planned withdrawal came more than a month ahead of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The international boundaries are not entirely clear and there is
no peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   While there is still some confusion about the details, the
withdrawal has clearly recast the region. Whether it brings peace,
however, depends on how the Middle East's leaders respond.
</P>
<P>
   Barak will have to show his people that air power can defend
them without their so-called ``security zone'' in Lebanon. But, he
will have to do so without the heavy-handed attacks in Lebanon that
have brought international condemnation in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah sheiks will have to decide if they are done fighting
Israel and want to focus on their political activities.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian President Hafez Assad faces new decisions, too, in his
quest to get the Golan Heights back from Israel. Will he seek
leverage by continuing to encourage attacks against Israel by
Hezbollah or other militias in Lebanon? Or, will he see more
benefit in coming back to the negotiating table?
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials will be urging all sides to remain calm. They
want a peace deal before President Bill Clinton, apparently seen as
reliable by both Assad and Barak, leaves office in eight months.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate question is whether the border between Israel and
Lebanon will be peaceful. It is now lined daily with curious,
angry, and sometimes armed Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   They gawk at the Israeli towns and army patrols on the other
side of the fence. Those towns in the past have been frequent
targets for Hezbollah Katyusha rockets.
</P>
<P>
   For now, neither side wants to disturb the peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have some sort of balance of terror, a sort of cold
war between Israel and Syria,'' said American University of Beirut
political scientist Nizar Hamzeh. ``Israel definitely has more
power but Hezbollah has the Katyushas.''
</P>
<P>
   The key is Hezbollah's 39-year-old, charismatic, leader Sheik
Hassan Nasrallah.
</P>
<P>
   Nasrallah met with foreign journalists Thursday. It was in the
type of Spartan meeting room, with plastic chairs and peeling white
walls, that has enhanced the group's reputation as uncorrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Cordial and relaxed, Nasrallah basked in what he and others are
calling the first Arab victory over Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But, he was intentionally enigmatic about Hezbollah's next move.
</P>
<P>
   He said Hezbollah would keep attacking Israeli troops until
Israel vacated the disputed Chibaa Farms area and released war
prisoners. He said Hezbollah's victory should convince Palestinians
to drop their peace process with Israel and adopt armed resistance.
</P>
<P>
   But, he also said Hezbollah would not hurt civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any intention to attack civilians. But not all
Israelis are civilians,'' he said. ``Anything is possible, but in
regard to civilians we are extremely careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Israel and the SLA have killed far more Lebanese
civilians than Hezbollah has killed Israeli civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah might not want to risk Israeli reprisals that could
endanger its victory or anger Lebanese. Nasrallah is not just
concerned with rockets. He's also counting votes and Hezbollah's
popularity is soaring.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its guerrilla force, it runs hospitals and
schools and has seven members in the Lebanese parliament.
</P>
<P>
   With its ``liberation'' of south Lebanon, it surely won votes
for parliamentary elections in August. It had already moved three
mobile medical clinics into the south by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say that the platform for the parliament is
beginning today,'' Hamzeh, the political analyst, said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Barak is also basking in victory. A Gallup poll of
Israelis conducted Wednesday showed 75 percent supporting the
withdrawal, and Barak with a 54 percent approval rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``He promised and delivered, and it wasn't only an election
slogan,'' wrote columnist Hemi Shalev in the Ma'ariv daily. ``But,
one cannot take away from Barak the fateful moment when he assumed
responsibility and made a decision. The end result may not yet have
been tested, but he has already passed the test of courage.''
</P>
<P>
   On trips throughout nervous northern Israel following the
withdrawal, Barak tried to explain how he would keep Israel safe
despite the Hezbollah troops at the border fence.
</P>
<P>
   Now, air power, without ground troops, compose the deterrence
against attacks. The strikes could be against Hezbollah or its
Syrian backers in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``No target and no element of power in Lebanon will be immune to
a painful reprisal. Without our presence on Lebanese soil, there is
no restriction to a harsh reaction to aggression,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   While threatening Syria, Barak still hopes for the peace deal
with President Assad that is needed to truly bring peace to
Israel's northern border. Israel has given vague offers to give up
the strategic Golan Heights. Syria rejected the deal, saying it had
not been assured the Golan withdrawal would be complete.
</P>
<P>
   Assad could still use Hezbollah to exert pressure on Israel.
Sheikh Nasrallah said that Hezbollah owes Syria help in winning the
Golan.
</P>
<P>
   But, given Barak's warnings of reprisals and the lack of Israeli
targets in his backyard of Lebanon, Assad may opt to get what he
can through negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials, who have tried hard to woo Assad back to the
negotiating table, have made it clear that they will blame Assad
for violence in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   One player in the arena, at least, is finished. The South
Lebanon Army has dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 SLA fighters have turned themselves over to Lebanese
officials, who will try them as traitors. About 6,000 SLA fighters
and their families were refugees in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   SLA commander, Gen. Antoine Lahad reportedly told an Israeli
newspaper that he felt ``conned'' by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is over, as far as I'm concerned. Don't call me
'general' any more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials later said that Lahad denied making those
comments, but by then he was headed to his home and family in
France.

MUGGED AND SHOELESS IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., May 28) 
 By ELLEN TIEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, I was mugged. It was a quick transaction, efficient
and surreal. No roughness, no ugly words. It was, in fact, oddly
unthreatening, a mugging that seemed almost like an edgy Details
fashion shoot. I might have processed it, repressed it and moved on
as New Yorkers do, were it not that the mugger committed one
unspeakable act that left me feeling less a crime victim than a
fashion victim.
</P>
<P>
   It was a beautiful spring day, and I was shopping for summer
clothes, heading from Scoop on lower Broadway toward Calypso. And
since I'm never exactly sure where Calypso is, I had simply tuned
my retail antennae to detect beaded jute evening bags and was
wandering east, toward the NoLIta neighborhood north of Little
Italy. That's how I found myself on a semideserted block of
Elizabeth Street _ or was it Mott? _ glancing into shop windows,
thinking deep thoughts. Did I prefer new sunglasses with blue or
amber lenses? That was when I nearly stumbled into a man standing
still as a stone directly in my path.
</P>
<P>
   He was tallish, 30 or so and stocky, with dark, close-cropped
hair. Not unpleasant looking. He wore a green army jacket and
fatigues _ seasonally appropriate, although a little too
matchy-matchy for my taste. As I gave him a reflexive once-over, I
noticed that under his jacket he held a gun. A tiny gun, almost too
small to be real. His hand was wrapped clumsily around it, as
though it were a pack of turkey sausages. It looked as if he had
misplaced his own gun and at the last minute had been forced to
borrow his kid sister's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me all your cash,'' he said calmly.
</P>
<P>
   My cash. Ah. This was reality. Tiny or not, a gun's a gun, so I
reached into my Fendi baguette, shakily beginning a stream of
soothing patter. ``OK, OK, I'm giving you all my cash, it's fine, I
have plenty of cash, this will be fine,'' I muttered.
</P>
<P>
   I took roughly $200 out of my wallet, patted the bills flush and
put them in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``Now give me your jacket.''
</P>
<P>
   My jacket. Amid the car-alarm noise sounding in my brain, I must
admit I was too busy coming up with reasons for why I didn't care
about losing the jacket to consider scanning the streets for help.
It was a black leather jacket _ Barneys, circa 1997 _ and I had
always been a bit on the fence about it anyway. I took it off,
automatically folded it with the lining out (nerves made me a
fastidious target of crime) and held it out for him like a cake.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed about ready to leave, then at the last moment glanced
down like someone making an impulse purchase at a cash register.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' he said. ``And give me your shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   My shoes?
</P>
<P>
   He wanted my shoes. This was very bad. I was using them! Every
quaking muscle of my body resisted taking them off. I stood frozen.
Appalled. I nearly explained that he didn't really want them since
they weren't that valuable, they were last year's Gucci loafers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I said, ``They're not going to fit you.''
</P>
<P>
   He was unmoved. ``Just give me your shoes,'' he repeated
levelly.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was his stylish little gun. Maybe it was the way he was
more interested in my clothes than my credit cards. But on some
level, I was beginning to feel comfortable enough with my mugger to
ask a favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, can I catch a cab first?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have any money for a cab,'' he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   So true. I couldn't really argue, particularly since he was the
one holding the gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I guess I'm giving you my shoes,'' I said. I bent over,
took them off my feet, lined them up neatly, toes out, and handed
them over.
</P>
<P>
   There was an awkward pause. What does one say, really, at the
end of such a transaction? Farewell? Wear them in good health?
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' I offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   We nodded tersely at each other. My shoes and jacket cradled in
his arms, he walked calmly away.
</P>
<P>
   And that was that. Except I had no shoes. And in keeping with
the current fashion, I also had no socks. Granted, I was fine,
luckily, I was physically unhurt and I had sustained no great loss.
</P>
<P>
   But these advantages seemed trifling in the reality of that
moment: I was barefoot, in SoHo. Any lingering fear from the
robbery was eclipsed by the humiliation of my naked feet. Some
weirdo had taken my shoes, and now he had made me the weirdo.
</P>
<P>
   I squelched the urge to tell fellow pedestrians that my
barefooted-ness was a grim accident, that in no way did I believe
this to be a good look for me. It never occurred to me to call the
police, even though I was still carrying my cell phone. Every fiber
of my being became focused on my feet. My brain went on auto-pilot:
Must find footwear. Must cover feet.
</P>
<P>
   I made a beeline for a Korean manicure place that I vaguely
recalled being in the neighborhood, and went in, flushed and
unshod. ``Hi,'' I said apologetically. ``The worst thing just
happened. I got mugged, and the guy took my shoes. Could you
please, please give me a pair of pedicure flip-flops?''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the plaintive embarrassment of a fellow Asian,
combined with my relatively fresh pedicure, were sufficient
persuasion. The owner _ with the arched eyebrow of a skeptical
auntie _ handed over a pair of thongs.
</P>
<P>
   Later, my husband would ask why I hadn't simply gone into a
store and bought another pair of shoes, since I still had my credit
cards. So like a man! Obviously, you can't shop for shoes when
you're not wearing any.
</P>
<P>
   Feet blessedly shod, I made my way home, fixating on sterilizing
my feet, assiduously ignoring the frightening might-have-beens. It
was far more comforting to compare my encounter to an episode of
``Seinfeld'' than ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' _ as comic happenstance, not
serious danger. Guns and violence weren't things I could or wanted
to relate to. Shoes were.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as I flip-flopped my way uptown, I had an epiphany,
though not the kind that people usually have after a potentially
life-threatening experience. Shoes are important. People need
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   While I've always had great admiration for shoes, from a
consumer's perspective, it wasn't until this moment that I fully
appreciated their psychological place. Not merely your ticket into
any 7-Eleven in the country, shoes are a vital part of being a
functioning member of society.
</P>
<P>
   And herein lay the subtle cruelty of my mugger's crime. Had he
taken my shirt and pants, the direness of the situation would have
been immediately telegraphed to passers-by. Had he taken my jewelry
like any normal mugger _ a diamond Tiffany Victorian necklace and
two Schlumberger rings _ the loss would have been obviously
lamentable. But to rob me of my shoes was to rob me of my
respectability. Missing shoes are akin to missing teeth, an
embarrassing reflection of your own negligence.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the insides of your shoes are the one small piece
of territory that only you inhabit. They symbolize where you stand.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure this wasn't foremost on my mugger's mind. I imagine he
was more of a logo-poacher than an evil genius or even a fetishist.
Nonetheless, somewhere out there, a man was now hawking what had
once been my own custom-worn size-7 footholds on the world.
</P>
<P>
   I hope he got a good price.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As a girl, thinking about what she would be when she
grew up, Val Ackerman just assumed she'd be an athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   After all, her grandfather ran high school and college sports
programs and coached her father's basketball team at Trenton State
College. When she was a teen-ager in Pennington, N.J., playing
field hockey; swimming butterfly and freestyle; competing in track
and field; and emerging as a star small forward in basketball, her
father was her high school's athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   A self-described tomboy and daddy's girl, Ackerman, 40, has
indeed kept up the family tradition, though in a way she could not
have imagined when she was decorating her teen-age bedroom with
posters of her sports heroes, John Havlicek and Jerry West.
</P>
<P>
   For Ackerman has the ultimate athletic director's job, as
president of the Women's National Basketball Association, the
league she worked exhaustively to create. The WNBA, which expands
to 16 teams this year, begins its fourth season Monday in Houston,
with the Comets playing the New York Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Having been team captain for three years at the University of
Virginia and then spending a year on a French team before she went
to law school at UCLA, Ackerman is also currently the only head of
a professional major league who has actually played its sport.
</P>
<P>
   How many times have you been called intense, Ackerman?
</P>
<P>
   That's certainly the impression she conveys, sitting in her
Midtown office, speaking in bursts, her lanky limbs perpetually
shifting, long fingers gripping, twirling, flipping a basketball,
never losing control.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 100 million,'' she says, adding, ``But I'm a nice
person, too,'' and blushes, embarrassed at owning up.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that despite the magnitude of her accomplishments _
her boss, David Stern, commissioner of the NBA, which owns the
WNBA, has no trouble giving her most of the credit for what has
become the most successful of the 15 efforts to start a
professional women's basketball league since 1974 _ Ackerman has
difficulty taking credit for much, unless, like a sports statistic,
it is irrefutable. (``I was the top scorer my sophomore year.'')
</P>
<P>
   She uses ``we'' a lot as she recalls the early days when, as a
lawyer for the NBA, she harangued her company and USA Basketball to
join forces to build a women's Dream Team, which played together
for a year (52-0!) before storming the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
``We'' dominates the telling of how she persuaded Stern, team
owners, sponsors and networks that plenty of fans _ 2.5 million
expected to attend this summer _ believed a women's league was
worth shouting about.
</P>
<P>
   So why not say ``I,'' Ackerman? Is she just cautious, mindful of
corporate egos?
</P>
<P>
   The question startles her. Her reticence isn't about being savvy
and political, she says. Instead, she says, what she's gleaned from
sports as a leader of teams rather than, say, a golfer, is
collaboration. Taking sole credit seems anathema.
</P>
<P>
   ``And couldn't some of it be just shyness and modesty?'' she
says, flushing.
</P>
<P>
   Work with us, Ackerman. What can we say you did?
</P>
<P>
   She hesitates. ``I helped choose the colors of the WNBA
basketball,'' she offers at last, holding aloft the
orange-and-white object in question.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say she's a pushover. Ackerman's league, backed
by NBA millions, prevailed even as the rival American Basketball
League, which had a winter season, and better-paid and arguably
more stellar players, folded in December 1998. (``They were a
mom-and-pop operation and made some bad business decisions,'' she
says.)
</P>
<P>
   And she went head-to-head last year with union negotiators for
WNBA players in their first collective bargaining effort. As a
former player herself who had become the epitome of management, she
grew haggard trying to create a contract that would be fair to her
sister athletes even as she had to watch the bottom line of a
league that still operates solidly in the red.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when asked about the dearth of female coaches in the league,
the modest salaries and short season, she answers like a careful
lawyer, invoking ``the need for patience.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the May/June swimsuit issue of Sports
Illustrated for Women, with a cover showing the WNBA star Lisa
Leslie in a midriff-baring suit, Ackerman, the mother of two young
daughters, mutters something about healthy body images versus
objectifying women athletes. She does not look happy.
</P>
<P>
   She prefers to dwell on the league's accomplishments. Noting
that 75 percent of arena fans are female, she says, ``We're not
just entertainment,'' the league represents something deeper. She
tells a story: in Charlotte, N.C., a 10-year-old girl, wide-eyed,
eager, asked for her autograph. A man watched intently. ``You must
be the dad, you must be proud,'' Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, he wrote, thanking her. ``He said that at WNBA
games he found time and a way to bond with his daughter,'' Ackerman
says, ``and that becoming a fan of women players had increased her
self-esteem. And I thought: `Whoa! That is overwhelming to me!'''
</P>
<P>
   So, Ackerman, how would you describe your role in women's
basketball?
</P>
<P>
   She grins, shyly. ``I've been a beneficiary of it,'' she says,
``and a catalyst, too.''

DURABLE GOODS DROP 6.4 PERCENT WHILE CONSUMER SPENDING GROWTH
SLOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN VAMES   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Business and consumer demand in the U.S. appeared to slow in
April, two government reports showed Friday. The two reports
suggest the spending spree that has been an engine for the U.S.
economy may be slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   Orders for durable goods, a measure of demand for items meant to
last for three or more years, posted the biggest decline since
December 1991, dropping 6.4 percent in April to a seasonally
adjusted $205.58 billion, the Commerce Department said. That
followed a 4.5 percent increase in March to $219.72 billion,
revised from an initial rise of 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, growth in consumer spending slowed for the second
straight month in April to a 0.4 percent pace from 0.6 percent pace
in March, even as personal incomes rose 0.7 percent vs. 0.6 percent
in March, the department reported.
</P>
<P>
   Although the demand side of the U.S. economy remains vibrant,
Friday's data could mark the beginning of a slowdown in some key
areas of economic growth. It could show that nearly a year of the
Federal Reserve's interest rate increases in an attempt to slow the
economy may be finally bearing fruit.
</P>
<P>
   But rising incomes, which have resulted from a 30-year low in
unemployment, continue to worry economists and policy makers, who
fear that businesses will eventually have to pass along higher
worker costs in their finished products. So far, a
technology-related surge in worker productivity since the mid-1990s
has allowed businesses to offset rising worker costs, but Fed
officials have repeatedly warned that a decline in productivity
could be a catalyst for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The income increase in April included a 0.9 percent rise in
wages and salaries, compared to a 0.6 percent rise in March.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that incomes rose faster than spending in April helped
to raise the so-called personal savings rate, a measure of the
proportion of income that does not get spent, which rose to 0.7
percent in April from March's 0.4 percent rate. That could be an
indicator that Americans, unnerved by a downturn in technology
stocks and higher interest rates, may be starting to save some of
their money instead of spending it.
</P>
<P>
   Durable goods orders dropped for the third time in four months,
surprising economists, who had been expecting a 0.3 percent
increase, according to a Reuters poll. The report showed sharply
lower demand for a variety of both consumer and capital goods, such
as automobiles, electrical machinery and defense-related goods.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding orders for transportation-related goods, demand
dropped by 6.4 percent in April, and excluding defense-related
goods, orders dropped 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The data provide evidence that business and consumer demand for
big-ticket items has finally been dented by the Fed's efforts to
raise interest rates. Higher rates make it more expensive for
consumers and businesses to borrow and spend, decreasing the
potential for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised short-term interest rates, which act as a
basis for other interest rates such as credit cards and mortgages,
six times over the past year for a total of 1.75 percentage points.
For its most recent increase on May 16, the Fed doubled the
magnitude from previous five, to half a percentage point, as it
intensified its efforts to slow overall demand in the economy.

NESTLE'S ALCON TO BUY SUMMIT AUTONOMOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN KOO   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alcon Laboratories, the eye care unit of food giant Nestle
(NSRGY:Nasdaq ADR), announced Friday that it will buy laser eye
surgery concern Summit Autonomous (BEAM:Nasdaq) for $892.8 million
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The move gives Alcon entree into the laser eye surgery market,
which is fast growing in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, Alcon will pay $19 for each
outstanding share of Summit. That's a premium of 50 percent to
Summit's closing price Thursday of 12 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Alcon makes eye care products such as eye drops, contact lens
solutions and office systems for opthamologists and optometrists.
Meanwhile, Summit, based in Waltham, Mass., develops and
manufactures the laser systems used to correct faulty vision. Last
year, the company bought Autonomous Technologies, which develops
the lasers used in eye surgery. Summit is the No. 2 maker of eye
lasers behind Visx (VISX:Nasdaq).
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth-based Alcon's name has also been bandied about of
late as a possible third party to swoop in and buy Wesley Jessen
VisionCare (WJCO:Nasdaq) and Ocular Sciences (OCLR:Nasdaq). The two
contact lens makers agreed to a merger in March only to have Bausch
&AMP; Lomb (BOL:NYSE) come in days later with an offer for Wesley
Jessen alone.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Summit soared 46 percent, or 5 7/8, to 18 9/16 in
Friday afternoon trading. There was no action in Nestle's American
depositary receipts.

 &HT;    Fixed-rate mortgage interest drops after recent increases
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the first time this month, long-term, fixed-rate
mortgage interest rates stopped climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates on the 30-year and 15-year loans in metro Atlanta
dropped an average three basis points each this week from last
week. The 30-year mortgage averaged 8.30 percent, down from 8.33
percent; the 15-year loan averaged 7.99 percent, down from 8.02
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the one-year, adjustable-rate loan was again up, at 7.14
percent, vs. last week's 7.03 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rates more than a percentage point higher than this time
last year, the Atlanta housing market continues to be strong, said
Pat Flood, president of HomeBanc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home buying is far more linked to employment than to interest
rates. Look at 1994, when rates were down at 7 percent. We did not
have a real active housing market because we were just coming out
of a recession and people were afraid to buy, even with low rates,
because they still felt their jobs might go. Right now, employment
in Atlanta could hardly be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Bank Rate Monitor, which tracks mortgage rates, reported that
the 30-year loan carried an average of 0.76 discount points, while
the 15-year mortgage had 0.73 points. The ARM had 0.23 points. A
point, 1 percent of the loan amount, is a fee lenders charge at
closing.
</P>
<P>
   FRAUD PLAN DESIGNED TO PROTECT HOMEOWNERS
</P>
<P>
   Tale after tale of predatory lending has documented how home
buyers have been lured into taking loans they cannot afford on
houses not worth the money.
</P>
<P>
   One of many agencies now interested in the problem is the
Department of Housing and Urban Development. It has come up with a
Fraud Protection Plan designed to shield the unwary from predatory
lenders. The plan, which resulted from forums held in several
cities this year, aims to protect families that get new mortgages
insured by the Federal Housing Authority, a HUD agency.
</P>
<P>
   The problem largely has been caused by good news, the booming
housing market that characterizes many U.S. cities, observed HUD
spokesman Lee Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Predatory lending has gotten so big so quickly and so
explosively that we have to move very fast to get ahead of it,''
Jones said Thursday. ``Especially in hot markets like Atlanta, a
lot of people want to buy,'' and a lot of banks want to help them _
even unscrupulous ones.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jones, HUD already has regulatory authority to
impose sanctions on dishonest lenders and home appraisers, and it
will ask Congress to pass laws to cover the entire market, not just
FHA-insured homes.
</P>
<P>
   Elements of the plan, which will be funded from the FHA's
general budget, include:
</P>
<P>
   _ If a mortgage is based on a fraudulent appraisal, the FHA can
force the lender to rewrite it, based on true market value.
</P>
<P>
   _ Homeowners in danger of foreclosure will have access to free
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   _ The FHA will cap fees to prevent lenders from charging

RISING GAS PRICES PAINFUL FOR DRIVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER FRIEDLIN   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Maria Nunez, a Bronx resident who travels 45 minutes
a day to and from her babysitting job on Long Island, is feeling
the pain at the pump. And, like many Americans, Nunez is preparing
for even more costly visits to the filling station as summer
driving season kicks off this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few months ago, I was paying $1.31 a gallon and now I'm
paying $1.72 a gallon,'' said Nunez, 57, as she filled up her white
Mustang with premium unleaded at a gas station in Manhasset, N.Y.
``When's it going to stop?''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Energy Information Administration, not so soon.
Retail prices are expected to average $1.46 a gallon nationwide for
regular unleaded gasoline. That would be 25 percent higher than
last summer's average of $1.17 a gallon. Over the last three weeks,
the average nationwide price of unleaded regular gasoline has risen
11 cents to a high of $1.53 a gallon, foreshadowing a particularly
good quarter for the oil refiners.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday morning, New York Harbor unleaded gasoline futures
were down slightly after hitting a nine-year high on Thursday. June
futures were lately trading down at 0.5 cents, or 0.4 percent, at
$1.0075. On Thursday gasoline futures closed at $1.0121,
approaching the $1.0176 level reached in September 1990 during the
Persian Gulf crisis. And analysts believe there could be more
upside potential before the market turns around.
</P>
<P>
   While Americans make adjustments, such as filling up their tanks
with regular unleaded gasoline rather than premium unleaded, oil
refiners are looking forward to having their day in the sun,
following a two-year slump.
</P>
<P>
   After a glut of crude oil last year that caused drillers to cut
supply, gasoline inventories are now low. And profit margins, which
have been narrow, are widening as the spread between crude oil
prices and gasoline prices has increased to more than $10 a barrel
from as low as $3 a barrel in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The rising margins come even though crude oil prices have risen
in the same period from a low of $24.22 a barrel in January to the
current level of $29.90 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking ahead, we believe gasoline is likely to remain strong
this quarter,'' said Marianne Kah, chief economist at Conoco.
``Downstream operations have improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Fadel Gheit, an energy analyst at Fahnestock, said he is most
optimistic about the prospects for the independent refiners, which
have a tendency to ride to the top of the wave's crest and then
crash along with it. Integrated oil companies can offset some of
the volatility with their discovery and exploration activities.
</P>
<P>
   Gheit named Ultramar Diamond Shamrock (UDS:NYSE), Valero Energy
(VLO:NYSE), Tosco (TOS:NYSE) and Sunoco (SUN:NYSE), as companies he
particularly favors. He rates each of them a buy. Fahnestock does
not do underwriting.
</P>
<P>
   After a phenomenal first quarter, Gheit said the independent
refiners still have a lot of steam left to post strong
second-quarter earnings, adding that the stocks have yet to fully
reflect the improvement in the earnings outlook. For example,
Houston-based Ultramar is currently trading at less than eight
times forecasted 2000 earnings despite stronger-than-expected
first-quarter results that prompted analysts to raise their targets
for the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect Sunoco's second-quarter earnings to hit $1.15 a
share, more than 10 times its results in the year-earlier period.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, no one expects gasoline prices, which have
been even more buoyant than those of crude, to falter. With high
prices at the pump and inventories at their lowest level since
1997, refiners are ramping up production just as quickly as they
can. In order to meet demand, these companies are likely to
increase production to the point where they are refining to a very
high 97 percent of incoming crude.
</P>
<P>
   That means that explosions and fires, the basic facts of
refining life, could cause gasoline futures to move ever higher.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts said that some of the price pressure will be
offset as futures buyers start liquidating some of their positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Price action in this market has gotten somewhat ahead of what
can happen,'' said Tim Evans, a senior energy analyst at Pegasus
Econometric Group. ``With a lot of the potential tightness built
in, there is over the next three to four weeks the potential for
disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans added that oil prices might still have some upside
potential but added that some time in June they would likely start
heading back down to the mid 80-cent range as oil refiners start
making more supply available to the gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the way you could characterize it is the situation is
serious, but the prognosis is hopeful,'' Evans said.

T-BIRD WATCHERS CAN SNARE A RARE OLD SPECIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release on Sunday, May 28) 
 By MICHELLE KREBS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The official announcement took no one by surprise: Ford said
last week that it would bring back the Thunderbird, this time as a
two-seat roadster closely modeled on a concept car that was a
sensation at auto shows last year.
</P>
<P>
   The 2002 T-Bird, which goes into production early next year,
will pick up where the 1955-57 left off. For '58, the T-Bird became
a larger, heavier four-seat car, and in later years it grew bloated
and overwrought. But Ford says the next-generation T-Bird is a
modern interpretation of the original, complete with turquoise
emblems and porthole windows in the removable hardtop.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to stir up interest in the new car, even though
dealers have not begun to take orders, Ford is kicking off a
summerlong bird-watching contest that will culminate in a giveaway
of three original T-Birds.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this weekend in metropolitan New York, Southern
California and South Florida, three white mid-'50s roadsters will
drive through 144 communities. People who spot one of the cars _
they wear decals identifying them as part of Ford's American Dream
Car Tour _ can register to win one. Entries can be made over the
Internet at www.fordvehicles.com or by mail at Dream Car, Box 1955,
Young America, Minn. 55594; entrants should provide the day, city
and approximate location where they saw one of the special cars.
Winners are to be announced in October. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Price guides put the value of 1955-57 models _ the favorite of
collectors _ at $16,000 to $50,000. The '02 model, which will use
the rear-drive chassis and V-8 engine of the Lincoln LS sedan, is
expected to start around $35,000.

U.S. MAKES MODEST CHANGES IN PLAN TO BREAK UP MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL BRICK   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Department of Justice submitted Friday a slightly altered
plan to split Microsoft (MSFT:Nasdaq) into two companies, setting
the stage for a final ruling in the antitrust case against the
sofware giant possibly as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   The revised plan, filed Friday afternoon in federal court in
Washington, resembles the original one filed April 28, though
prosecutors tinkered with portions of the document that the federal
judge overseeing the case indicated were ambiguous. The 17 state
attorneys general who signed the proposal remain amenable to the
plan but have had little say in making the revisions.
</P>
<P>
   In what surprisingly became the final hearing in the case
Wednesday, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson praised a document filed
by a software industry association that advocated a three-way
breakup, calling it an ``excellent brief.''
</P>
<P>
   During the remedies phase of the case, various economists,
antitrust lawyers and observers have publicly considered three-way
and even five-way breakup proposals. But the Department of Justice
now appears to have taken the view of those who consider the
Windows operating system a so-called natural monopoly, a standard
to which consumers and hardware makers will gravitate no matter how
many operating system companies are created. Under that view, the
Justice Department would seek to spark competition by prying all
other software and Internet applications away from the
standard-setting Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The company will have two business days to file comments on the
form of the judge's proposal. A Microsoft spokesman declined to
comment further.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, analysts seemed alternately invigorated and
cautioned by the seemingly expedited pace of events in the
two-year-old antitrust battle. Jackson's comments in court
--including an expression of dismay at Microsoft lawyers' request
for several months to prepare for the remedies argument despite
their intention to appeal -- make it clear that the judge is ready
to end the case. But the time required for appeals is still
anybody's guess, and settlement talks could re-start in the
interim.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who has ruled that Microsoft employed illegal business
practices to extend a monopoly on computer operating systems to
other markets, appears to be moving quickly toward a final ruling.
Some analysts say the final ruling could come as early as next
week. Microsoft has repeatedly said it will appeal every aspect of
the case, from findings of fact to remedies. In a conference call
with analysts Thursday, company officials said they were
``disappointed'' with Jackson's expected ruling and reiterated
their intention to appeal the case, according to analysts' reports.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department proposal calls for a two-way breakup,
placing the Windows operating system in one company and creating a
second business for everything else, including software
applications, the Internet Explorer Web browser and the Microsoft
Network Internet service provider and network of Web sites.
Microsoft would have four months to submit a logistical plan for
compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Within 30 days of a ruling, the behavioral remedies outlined by
19 states and the Justice Department are supposed to take effect.
These remedies include publishing the so-called source code used by
programmers to design software applications for Windows. Other
proposed behavioral remedies would regulate Microsoft's relations
with computer makers and software firms.
</P>
<P>
   The company could ask an appeals court to stay a portion of the
remedies; Jackson himself could stay portions of his remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's remedies proposal, which it was required to file May
10, asked for a dismissal of the Justice Department's breakup
proposal. The company filed additional documents Monday to bolster
the dismissal motion, using arguments the government itself made in
its prior case against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to propose remedies for a ruling it plans to appeal on
behavior it still maintains was legal, Microsoft asked for
behavioral regulations, including restrictions governing the
company's license agreements with computer makers. In court
Wednesday, Microsoft lawyers declined to discuss their proposed
remedies, focusing instead on arguing against a breakup.

SECOND HAPPIEST GUY AT THE MAXIMUM GOLF PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, May 28) 
 By ANTHONY LAPPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Early Tuesday night, at a party for Maximum Golf, a
new magazine dedicated to the proposition that golf is a
beer-and-babes kind of sport, Michael Caruso could have used a
mulligan. The skies above the Central Park boathouse were
threatening rain. Guests were arriving, as frantic workers were
still constructing a 100-foot AstroTurf green, on which partygoers
would be given the chance to putt for what seems to be the only way
to get attention these days: a $1 million cash prize. Caruso, the
magazine's founder and editor in chief, had first planned for the
green to be floating on an artificial island in Central Park Lake.
But chipping balls into the water was not approved by the Parks
Department, resulting in last-minute chaos. The beleaguered editor
sidled up to the bar. ``Sorry, Buddy, the bar doesn't open for five
minutes,'' the bartender told him.
</P>
<P>
   Caruso smiled weakly. ``Throwing this party has been way more
difficult than launching the magazine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, he is used to rolling with punches. Maximum Golf is
the third magazine Caruso has edited; he left Los Angeles Magazine
during a dispute with its owner, Disney, over journalistic
standards, and he was fired as editor of Details last year, shortly
after boasting to The New York Post that he had raised circulation
and advertising so much he would soon get ``a big fat raise.''
</P>
<P>
   Some might say that he is having the last laugh. Under his
successor, Conde Nast pulled the plug on Details, and Caruso, 38,
has convinced Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. to finance his quirky
idea for a gonzo golf book. The first issue includes an expose by
Sylvester Stallone's estranged golf coach and a photo layout of
Melania Knauss naked in a bathtub of golf balls.
</P>
<P>
   Knauss looked as if she would rather be back in that tub as she
huddled for a photo with Caruso, Donald J. Trump and Isaac Hayes,
as a cold drizzle fell. The smiles disappeared as soon as the
camera flashes stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Caruso told Hayes that he was a fan of his work on ``Shaft'' and
``South Park.'' Hayes almost never plays golf. ``I just knock balls
into the water,'' he said. ``Jim Brown told me you are playing
against yourself. You have to block the rest of the world out.''
</P>
<P>
   It must be like performing in a concert, Caruso told him. Hayes
agreed. You get into a groove.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the party was supposed to be an appearance by a
3-year-old golf prodigy, but the child missed two six-foot putts
and ran into his mother's arms.
</P>
<P>
   Very little of the party focused on golf, or even Maximum Golf.
Among the nearly 1,000 people who turned up, there were many
friends, loyal former colleagues such as Tina Brown and family
members of Caruso. ``It's like a bar mitzvah,'' said Hilary Bass,
the publicity director for Talk Media.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the editor's fortunes changed.
</P>
<P>
   Caruso, who had begun to utter the mantra, ``I'm loving the
rain,'' was talking with his parents when Woody Harford, a
19-handicap marketing executive at British Airways, sunk the $1
million putt, sending the party into a frenzy. As guests chanted
``Woody! Woody!'' Caruso hugged the surprisingly nonchalant
Harford. ``I am the second happiest guy at this party,'' Caruso
said, explaining that he had taken an insurance policy out against
the shot.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Caruso moved the party downtown to Odeon. At 2 a.m.,
a final toast was made to ``Maximum Caruso.'' Caruso grabbed an
umbrella and began flagging taxis for friends. He was the last one
home.

EARLY CLOSING OF UNIVERSITIES PROTESTED IN BELGRADE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Several thousand students, teachers and
parents rallied Friday to protest the closing of universities a
week early by the government of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Under a decree issued Thursday by the Serbian minister for
higher education, Jevrem Janjic, Friday was the last day such a
rally could be held on university property. After Friday, students
and teachers will be allowed to enter their departments only for
final examinations, with their identity documents checked at the
door.
</P>
<P>
   At the rally Friday, in a crowded pedestrian space in front of
the Faculty of Philosophy, student activists of the Otpor, or
Resistance, movement and professors sympathetic to the political
opposition charged that the government was afraid of the students
and was acting illegally to shorten the school year and avoid a
student strike.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed to the beating Tuesday night of several students
who had intended to stay the night in protest at the architecture
department. But when they ignored a janitor's demand that they
leave, the lights for the entire street were shut off and men in
surgical masks drove them out of the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``This rally is a general protest against everything that is
happening in this country, repression, media darkness, beating of
students,'' said an architecture student named Marko, 21, who was
in the school when the masked men came.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will go anywhere we must to awaken a sleepy Belgrade,''
said Branko Ilic, an Otpor activist, who urged students to raise
their fists _ the Otpor symbol _ to show that ``you are not afraid
of the state of emergency'' and will gather again at the university
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Stevan Lilic, a law professor and member of the political
opposition, said the latest decree was a continuation of the law on
universities that put faculties under the state and has resulted in
the firings or forced resignations of nearly 200 professors in the
last three years.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lilic is the target of a campaign to fire him led by the Serbian
deputy prime minister, Vojislav Seselj, who was recently made a
professor of the law school. ``This is political intimidation and
an effort to threaten the faculty, and the reason for it is the
student protest movement, Otpor,'' Lilic said. He said he had
criticized his dean for not defending him against Seselj's threats,
which he said included having thugs follow him in the street.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Police officers watched the rally but did not interfere. Some
students later marched on Belgrade's city hall, demanding that
Serbia's political opposition act more vigorously to protest the
government's latest actions to shut the university, take Belgrade's
main television station, Studio B, from the opposition and carry
out a series of detentions of student and political activists
across Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition has called a rally for Saturday in downtown
Belgrade and is hoping for a large turnout from all over Serbia.
The opposition political leaders have disagreed on the need for
stronger action, like civil disobedience. They are struggling for a
platform that might emphasize more than unity and the need to
prepare for the local and federal elections that are due later this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   They will hold down the number of speakers at the rally and
include speakers from Otpor and well-known personalities from
Serbian life to try to give the rally a fresh feel. But it will be
difficult for them to articulate a clear strategy of action that
will answer criticism that the opposition favors the status quo
more than confrontation with the regime.
</P>
<P>
   Three senior opposition politicians, Vuk Draskovic of the
Serbian Renewal Movement, Zoran Djindjic of the Democratic Party
and Vojislav Kostunica of the Democratic Party of Serbia intend to
travel to Moscow on Monday to seek Russian help to mediate with the
regime. But it is still not clear at what level they will meet
Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In general, the authorities' new, harsh push against the
independent media, the opposition and the students _ justified on
the need to keep civic order and fight those who favor revolution _
is also designed to show citizens that ``the state exists and will
defend itself,'' said a senior official of one of the ruling
parties. The official added that ``Studio B could have continued to
spew out political propaganda for Vuk Draskovic forever, but we
could not let calls for armed rebellion be transmitted.''

<P>
   Government officials say they are simply not going to allow the
university buildings _ spread throughout Belgrade _ to become
centers for resistance to the authorities instead of an academy.
They have accused the student movement Otpor of links to the NATO
countries that bombed Serbia and want to replace Milosevic.

&HT;     LAWMAKER PUSHES BILL TO SPEED MEDICARE BENEFITS FOR AIDS
VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Tom A. Coburn, R-Okla., has introduced a bill
to eliminate the two-year period that disabled AIDS victims must
wait for Medicare benefits that cover drug therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Under Coburn's plan, which he introduced Thursday, disabled
people with AIDS who qualify for Social Security Disability
Insurance (SSDI) would immediately get benefits that cover the drug
treatments from Medicare, the federal health insurance plan for the
elderly and the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, people with AIDS must wait five months after an
independent team of doctors determines that they are unable to work
before getting SSDI. To qualify, they must have been paying into
the Social Security system for 1  &QC;  to 10 years, depending on their
age.
</P>
<P>
   After qualifying for SSDI, disabled AIDS victims then must wait
an additional 24 months to get Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn said Friday that people with AIDS and HIV, the virus that
causes the deadly disease, should not have to wait that long to get
treatments that can improve and prolong their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill will help make AIDS a chronic disease rather than a
death sentence for patients with HIV/AIDS,'' Coburn said. ``By the
time individuals infected with HIV/AIDS can access proper treatment
it's too little too late.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, no matching legislation has been introduced in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn's press secretary, John Hart, said no groups have yet
opposed the bill. The Congressional Budget Office has not yet
estimated its cost.
</P>
<P>
   Terje Anderson, executive director of the National Association
of People with AIDS, a national advocacy group, hailed the measure
as a ``great bill'' that could help HIV and AIDS victims pay for
combination-drug therapy that costs as much as $12,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This provides a safety net for people who have a fair amount
of work history, have been paying into the system and are disabled
but not poor enough to be eligible for Medicaid,'' Anderson said.
``If this were passed, a lot of people with HIV would benefit from
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid, the state and federal medical plan for the poor, also
covers the costs of drug therapies, but recipients need to be near
the poverty line, which is an annual income of $8,350 for one
person.
</P>
<P>
   Winnie Stachelberg, political director for the Human Rights
Campaign, a Washington advocacy group for gays and lesbians, called
the plan crafted by Coburn, who is also an obstetrician, a ``a real
step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Stachelberg added, ``This is absolutely Dr. Tom Coburn at his
best. He understands that a 24-month waiting period for Medicare
benefits for people with AIDS is ludicrous.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Judith Krantz may live in Bel Air, but she's a New
York girl by birth and by temperament.
</P>
<P>
   When she still lived in Manhattan, in 1962, she despaired of
being able to glimpse John Glenn, the first American to orbit
Earth, in a Fifth Avenue parade being held in his honor. So, she
went to Saks, secured a corner dressing room with windows in the
maternity department, and bought a king's ransom worth of clothes
she didn't need in order to eyeball her idol. But when she returned
her enormous purchase a few days later, Saks balked and canceled
her account.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't possibly do without a Saks charge,'' she said last
week, back at Saks, whipping through racks of Yves Saint Laurent.
``I wrote them and told them I had a miscarriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Krantz, 72, recalls the fib in her new memoir, ``Sex and
Shopping: The Confessions of a Nice Jewish Girl'' (St. Martin's).
She writes: ``Another step toward fiction? What's a short girl to
do?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This short girl _ 5 feet 2{ inches, she says _ has done just
fine. (Yes, her credit was reinstated.) Although she waited until
her two sons were grown before publishing her first novel, at 50,
the best-selling ``Scruples,'' she has published nine more best
sellers in the last 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Her books transcend the Hollywood gloss of a Jackie Collins, the
smarmy heat of a Danielle Steel. Rather, this Wellesley graduate
does diligent homework on all aspects of the fashion business, and
often the art, antiques and jewelry trades, spinning intricate
plots jammed with industry details, which also offer inside looks
at worlds of high-octane glamour. In today's runaway economy
they've taken on a practical dimension: a woman's guide to rubies
and Renoir.
</P>
<P>
   If Krantz's books celebrating Porthault sheets and the women who
love them seem oddly in style right now, their timeless appeal lies
in their compelling Cinderella stories. A Judith Krantz heroine is
beautiful but also smart, smart, smart. She learns a business along
with the reader as she works night and day, overcomes emotional
hardships (which only add depth to her natural beauty), and
eventually, with the aid of a handsome, powerful man and the
perfect Hermes bag, triumphs. No one whines. They act. The world
bursts with possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   It's a winning formula. Her books have sold 85 million copies in
52 languages. ``The boys gang has always resented me,'' she said.
``Sidney Sheldon, Irving Wallace, Harold Robbins. It was like `How
dare she do that?' Being from Hollywood, the press would describe
my house as a mansion when it's a perfectly normal house. They made
me the glamorous character from my novels, but those characters
were written by someone in J.Crew sweats who's not glamorous at
all.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not when she's writing, but she was certainly
turning heads at Saks. Though she said she was ``out of uniform''
by not wearing Chanel, she was flawlessly dressed in a pink and
gray tweed pantsuit with a matching coat, custom made by a Milanese
tailor. The Van Cleef &AMP; Arpels Bois de Rose, a white coral pin in
the shape of a flower with diamonds at the center, reflected the
luster of her South Seas pearl earrings and _ just as they do in
her books _ seemed to add a glow to her ivory complexion. As she
tore through the meager offerings of Gucci and Fendi with the sharp
eye of a military commander, the sales staff instinctively stood
back. They, not to mention their merchandise, were distinctly
outclassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now look at that,'' Krantz fumed, holding up a transparent
lime green Fendi skirt and top. ``Tell me, have you ever seen a
woman in a restaurant in a transparent top? Well, me neither.''
</P>
<P>
   Gucci fared no better. ``That is the worst knocked-off thing,''
she said, fingering a python print dress. ``And the length is
wrong. The fitter at Chanel will always say, `Mrs. Krantz, hemlines
are going down.' But I don't care. My skirts stay 19 inches from
the floor. That's what looks best on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Krantz is a clothes connoisseur, it is a mistake to think
her books are about shopping, even though ``Scruples'' was the name
of a fashion boutique. They are instead about the transforming
power of clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always use clothes for manipulation, to create an effect,''
she explained earlier at lunch at Le Cirque 2000. ``With the right
clothes, the character suddenly appears. In many cases, the clothes
reveal a personality that was obscured by poverty. I write about
clothes as magical things that can change you. I feel that women
are comforted by having clothes and accessories. I have every scarf
I've ever bought.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Krantz rarely goes shopping. ``I can't stand it,''
she said of going to malls. ``Anyway, California is not a dressed
up place. At every dinner party people wear black, which annoys me.
I don't wear black at night. I want to be more visible.''
</P>
<P>
   Among her other fashion dictums, Krantz says, she has never worn
jeans or a bikini (unflattering), swears by Hanro lingerie (no
seams) and thinks that as an accessory ``burgundy is the best
neutral.'' She also declares that she doesn't ``believe in plastic
surgery below the neck'' because people should diet and exercise.
What about breasts? She shrugged. ``So they droop,'' she said.
``Certain things just happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Perched on a banquette in the restaurant, her coat bundled
behind her, the writer in Krantz took over from the strident
fashion expert. She appeared small and tentative as she watched
other women parade past, bedecked and bejeweled, as if they were
characters in her books. The closer she observed, the smaller she
seemed to become. You can see why she says that it is the character
of the best friend that reflects her in her books, not the
heroines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heroine bears the burden of the plot and always has
dramatic things happen to her,'' she said. ``Her mother dies, her
father dies, some guy leaves her. The best friend is along for the
ride having a wonderful time, wearing crazy clothes that wouldn't
be becoming to a heroine, who must have a certain dignity and
gravitas. The heroines I create are all bigger than life. But the
best friend is a life-size person.'' She smiled. ``Usually short.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her own outfit matched neither description; it belonged to the
grande dame character, the doyenne who long ago learned the value
of quality. She kept talking as she ate her shad and bacon _
possibly the only woman in the room not picking at a salad _ and
said that flying lessons had prompted her to start writing novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always so afraid to fly, and when I finally learned how,
I think it made me write `Scruples','' she said. ``I thought, What
else am I terrified of doing? Writing fiction. I'm not sure why. I
think I was a victim of a very good education. I majored in English
literature and said, `I know I can't do that, so why do it at all?'
But there is a real place for a book that's not George Eliot but is
still for intelligent women.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason Krantz may have waited, she said, was because of
her mother. Mickey Tarcher sounds like a nightmare in Krantz's
memoir, though her independence was certainly exemplary. She
dropped out of school at 14 to work in a candy factory to help
support her family. After she married J.D. Tarcher, who became a
successful advertising executive, she earned her college degree, a
master's in economics and a law degree. She spent her career at the
Legal Aid Society and her time at home raising, and often
criticizing, her daughters, Judy and Mimi, and her son, Jeremy. She
also endured a lifetime of cheating from her husband. When he died
in 1960, she sold the weekend home he loved and its contents within
two days. She dressed her children cheaply, withholding material
rewards as consistently as she withheld emotional ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream was that my mother would come home with a big package
from Best with cashmere sweaters for me,'' Krantz said, her voice
growing full. ``That's where I got the magic of clothes, because my
mother didn't give them to me. If she had, I never would have known
the power, magic and mystery clothes could have. Out of that
yearning you get fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   It is probably no accident that in 10 Judith Krantz novels, six
of her heroines have mothers who die when their daughters are
younger than 8.
</P>
<P>
   In her real life, Krantz has been married to the film and
television producer Steve Krantz for 46 years. Their son Nick is a
stockbroker, their son Tony is the chief executive of Imagine
Television, and the couple have two grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in years, she hasn't started her next novel.
``I have a crazy plan not to do anything and see what happens,''
she said. ``I'd love to do something different, have a life change.
There are so many things I don't know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   As she spoke, her blue eyes sparkled and the air filled with the
unmistakable sense of possibility.

<P>
   TRADE-DEMOCRACY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Support for normal trading
rights for China was based in part on the argument that free trade
can foster democracy. Around the rest of Asia, there is a clear _
if sometimes tenuous _ connection between the growth of market
capitalism and the growth of some kind of democratic institutions,
although there are exceptions. Free markets don't equal freedom,
but they make it a lot harder for the government or corrupt
bureaucrats to rule over everyday choices. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-HISTORY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Israel is engaged in a
national debate over new histories of Zionism and changes in the
school curriculum. These revise the standard Zionist self-image _
the righteous, selfless pioneer _ in favor of a more complicated
and less heroic one. These new histories portray early Zionists
both as humans drawn into the inhumanity of war and as calculating
European colonialists. An assumption of much of the new historical
scholarship is that Israel shares the blame for the conflict with
its adversaries and should come to terms with them as moral and
cultural equals. The fight over history is in the background as
Israel stakes out a new strategy for confronting Syria and Lebanon,
its remaining Arab adversaries to the north. By Ethan Bronner.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-EUROPE-REVIEW (Berlin) _ The Cold War has been over for a
decade, and the big questions _ Euromissiles, Soviet divisions,
global peace itself _ have disappeared from U.S. relations with
European capitals. Beyond the intermittent flaring of Balkan
crises, their place has largely been taken by genetically altered
food, banana trade, capital punishment and even child custody.
America's apparent determination to build a national missile
defense system could still spur a major confrontation with Russia
that would be deeply troubling to Washington's European allies.
But, in general, how to live, what to eat and whether to accept the
death sentence seem to have become the stuff of trans-Atlantic
tiffs. The recurrent rows over such questions are sometimes viewed
as a sign of the fraying ties between Europe and the United States.
By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   SCHORK-JOURNALISM-REVIEW (Berlin) _ Journalism, it is said,
provides a first draft of history. It is a cliche, yet sometimes an
unlikely combination of war and a witness illustrates the hallowed
truth that lurks behind a hollow phrase. I write this sitting in
Berlin, dreaming of Bosnia, and thinking of Kurt Schork, the
Reuters correspondent whose dispatches from Sarajevo helped shape
the world's view of a war as morally indelible to my generation of
correspondents as Vietnam was to another. Schork, 53, was killed
Wednesday in an ambush in Sierra Leone. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ARMS-CONTROL-REVIEW (Undated) _ New frontiers in arms control:
for the first time in many years, arms control experts are
exploring new, potentially better ways to actually control them.
Top thinkers of the political left and right are declaring
traditional arms control all but dead and calling for deep cuts in
remaining arsenals, for building anti-missile defenses against
rogue states, and for finally getting serious about stopping the
spread of missile technology and nuclear arms. It's thinking about
the unthinkable in a new way. By William Broad.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-LEBANON-REVIEW (Undated) _ The question hanging over the
abrupt Israeli departure is whether, in the absence of any other
force, Hezbollah will bring quiet or if they will attempt to
transfer their war of attrition across the border. The unknown
answer will reverberate across a spectrum of Middle East issues,
but none more than the attempts by Israel and its neighbors to
erect some form of workable peace. By Neil Macfarquahar.

</P>
<P>
   SOUTH-CLOSURE-REVIEW (Atlanta) _ When prosecutors in Birmingham,
Ala., charged two former Ku Klux Klansmen with the 1963 bombing of
a black church, there was talk about closure. But what is closure?
Is it merely a psychological phenomenon or a political one or some
melding of the two? Has the word become so overused and applied to
so many disparate circumstances as to become all but meaningless?
Can a judicial resolution really soothe the agony endured by
victims, families and other wounded parties, or does it only serve
to revive pain that had long ago subsided? Across the world, from
South Africa to Chile to Neshoba County, Miss., to cities like
Washington and New York that have built Holocaust museums, the
search for closure has become a driving force in politics, law and
even culture. By Kevin Sack.

   HYPERCONVENIENCE-FOODS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Everyone knows America

First there was the TV dinner. Then came fast food for meals on the

time for something marketers call hyperconvenience food, portable
comfort cuisine and dashboard dining. By Constance L. Hays.

   NRA-RESTAURANT-REVIEW (New York) _ In a city aswarm with new

IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO RECOGNIZE THIS COLONEL'S BRAVERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The disembodied voice of the pilot sounded through the
airplane's announcement system. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, we have a distinguished guest flying
with us today. It is my privilege to recognize Medal of Honor
winner Mr. Lewis Millett.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr.'' Millett. What an incredible slight, however
unintentional, to a man who earned this country's highest military
honor for his bravery. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scattered applause followed the pilot's introduction of Col.
Lewis L. Millett. Had the other passengers on the flight from
Charlotte, N.C., to Dallas/Fort Worth Airport heard what I had
about this remarkable man during the National Rifle Association's
annual meeting, one hopes that they would have leapt to their feet
in a thunderous ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Too many Americans don't even know what the Medal of Honor is,
much less what it takes to receive it. Is it too much to hope that
on this Memorial Day weekend, some Americans might actually pause
between the barbecues and the sales to think about the people who
made their freedom possible?
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Millett, a true American hero, is one tough old soldier.
The 79-year-old veteran may be slowed by time and may walk with a
cane, but he's still as mentally sharp as the fixed bayonet he used
to lead two platoons in the 1951 assault near Soam-Ni, Korea.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing easy about the mission that lay ahead for the
Wolfhound Regiment's Easy Company that February day. Millett,
leading his company against a fiercely held position, saw that the
1st Platoon was pinned down by enemy fire.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Millett ordered the 3rd Platoon forward and led both
groups in an assault up the fire-swept hill.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old fighting man from Mechanic Falls, Maine,
bayoneted two enemy soldiers and then continued on, shouting
encouragement to his men while throwing grenades and clubbing and
bayoneting the enemy. He was wounded by grenade fragments but
refused to evacuate until the hill was secured.
</P>
<P>
   Easy Company killed 47 of the enemy that day, while another 60
had reportedly been wounded and evacuated off the hill during the
battle. Of the dead, 18 died of bayonet wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bayonet wounds. They were reportedly a rarity during the Civil
War, when the technology of death was much less sophisticated than
what was available during the Korean War. Imagine what kind of
fighting that must have been.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the high-tech, never-see-your-enemy, impersonal war
of today. This was down-and-dirty, hand-to-hand struggle, where
soldiers not only saw their enemies but looked them right in the
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The eyes that faced down the enemy in 1951 still sparkle as the
man who served his nation during three wars tells his stories. What
you won't read in the official accounts of Millett's bravery, he
willingly tells about himself.
</P>
<P>
   He's the only Medal of Honor recipient to be court-martialed for
desertion.
</P>
<P>
   At 17, Millett joined the National Guard and then enlisted in
the Army Air Corps as an air gunner in 1940. When President
Roosevelt announced that the United States would not intervene
overseas _ and held firm to that until after the bombing of Pearl
Harbor _ Millett bolted for the north.
</P>
<P>
   He was a fighting man who believed in freedom for everyone, not
just Americans. The Canadian army had joined the fray, so Millett
signed on with it.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. brass frowned on his passion.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Millett and the United States, everything worked
out, but not until after he was convicted for desertion.
</P>
<P>
   After Korea, Maj. Millett attended the Infantry Officers
Advanced Course and Ranger School at Fort Benning, Ga. Then he was
assigned to the 101st Airborne Division, where he founded the
Recondo School.
</P>
<P>
   His Vietnam duties included the establishment of the Vietnamese
Ranger School and the commando training program in Laos.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Millett retired in 1973 after serving as the deputy
commander of the 2nd Corps. In addition to the Medal of Honor, his
awards include the Distinguished Service Cross, Silver Star, Legion
of Merit (with two oak leaf clusters), Air Medal (with numeral 2),
Purple Heart (with three oak leaf clusters), Vietnamese Cross of
Gallantry and Vietnam Campaign Ribbon.
</P>
<P>
   When asked last week whether he considers himself a hero, he
replied: ``No. I'm a warrior.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, colonel. From here, the applause is deafening

   &QL;  WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 230.
WASHINGTON, May 26 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: AID
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 91 to 4, a $15 billion spending
package that will reduce the cost of federal crop insurance and
provide over $7 billion in ``emergency'' spending for farmers.
Supporters said the package would help farmers in one of the worst
agricultural recessions in recent history. Opponents said the
package was crafted to win favor in an election year. A ``yes''
vote favors the package.
</P>
<P>
   VOTE : 1
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: PNTR
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 237 to 197, a measure granting
China permanent normal trade relations. The measure lowers tariffs
on U.S. goods going to China and permanently grants the trade
status that had been approved on an annual basis for 20 years.
Supporters said the measure opened up a giant market for U.S. goods
and without the trade status the U.S. would be left out of key
trade deals when China joins the World Trade Organization.
Opponents said it would move U.S. jobs overseas and leave no
incentive for China to improve its human rights record and labor
standards. A ``yes'' vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: AID
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved by a unanimous voice-vote a $15
billion spending package that will reduce the cost of federal crop
insurance and provide over $7 billion in ``emergency'' funding for
farmers. Supporters said the package would help farmers in one of
the worst agricultural recessions in recent history. Opponents said
the package was crafted to win favor in an election year. There was
no recorded tally of votes.

 By ANDREA MANDEL-CAMPBELL 
 c.2000 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ATIZAPAN, Mexico _ When Rodrigo Sosa first entered the Instituto
Tecnologico two years ago, the 20-year-old industrial engineering
student didn't know how to turn on a computer. Now, from a
sun-dappled picnic bench, the clean-cut sophomore plugs his laptop
into one of 2,300 campus fiber optic hookups to check four e-mail
accounts and several online chat sites. At the same time, he
listens to the guitar licks of the Chemical Brothers, a soundtrack
he downloaded over the net.
 &HT;    Sosa spends between six and seven hours a day in front of his
computer, much of it admittedly playing Starcraft, a virtual
reality war game. Still, he says, his computer has become an
indispensable tool, not only for homework and research but for
finding class schedules, keeping tabs on upcoming assignments and
downloading assigned reading material.
 &HT;    Sosa had little choice but to enter the computer age. He is part
of a new generation of students at ``the Tec,'' perhaps Latin
America's most wired university. In 1997, the Monterrey-based
institution with 85,000 students at its 30 campuses across Mexico
introduced a novel educational approach. Each professor and student
received an e-mail account. They were then connected to ConectaTec,
the campus Internet system, and IntraTec, a second network that can
be accessed from home. These networks, coupled with the
institution's extensive distance-learning program, provide a
massive educational platform.
 &HT;    ``The future is technology and if we prepare our students
properly they will be the future,'' says Emilio Alvarado, general
director of the State of Mexico campus of the Instituto
Tecnologico.
 &HT;    The sprawling 26-hectare university, which is located on the
northern outskirts of Mexico City, affords a glimpse of that
future. In stark contrast to the rest of Mexico, where computers
are found in only 3 percent of homes, desktop computers and laptops
are everywhere _ crammed into bulging backpacks, crowded onto
library desks and sprawled across campus lawns. Some 80 percent of
students own their own computers, of which half are laptops.
 &HT;    In a bid to wire still more students, in January the Tec
introduced at the State of Mexico and Monterrey campuses the
WaveLAN radio card created by Lucent Technologies, making it the
first academic institution in Mexico to adopt the new technology on
a massive scale. The powerful wireless card, which works in
conjunction with 40 antennas stationed around campus, allows
limitless web access to the school's increasingly congested
conventional telephone lines. ``The only place students won't be
able to access the Internet is from the women's bathroom,'' jokes
Alexander Baber, regional director of business partnerships for
Lucent Technologies in Mexico.
 &HT;    The card will also give students the opportunity to connect to
the campus' new Internet portal, also launched in January, which
offers everything from news and weather to a search engine.
E-commerce will follow once the school receives approval from a
local bank to do online transactions.
 &HT;    The new portal is just the latest in the school's recent history
of innovations. In the 1990s, its Internet department designed web
pages for the office of the presidency, the federal Congress, the
environment ministry and Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), the
state-owned oil company. Just this year, it started the use of a
smart card ID that can be used to monitor staff attendance or make
campus purchases.
 &HT;    Mexican businessman Eugenio Garza Sada, the former head of a
powerful industrial conglomerate known as the Monterrey Group,
founded the Instituto Tecnologico de Monterrey in 1943. In 1950,
the Tec became the first academic institution in the region to be
accredited by the U.S. Southern Association of Colleges and
Schools. In 1963, it purchased its first computer, and by 1980
began offering undergraduate degrees in computer science.
 &HT;    In 1994, the Mexico State branch created the school's first
computer laboratories and soon became the testing ground for the
local version of Microsoft Windows 95. Six years later, the campus
boasts 15 computer laboratories with 400 computers _ including a
new facility donated by Intel in January dedicated to e-commerce.
That lab, which includes 15 computers sporting Microsoft's
e-commerce software and another 15 with IBM's Internet commerce
program, is part of a master's degree in e-commerce introduced in
1998 that teaches students everything from designing a virtual
store to strategy and logistics. Fifty students have so far signed
up for the new program of study.
 &HT;    These initiatives are aimed at preparing tomorrow's leaders in
business and government, but the university's graduates already
include a veritable who's who of Mexico. ``It's the MIT of Latin
America,'' says Lucent's Baber. An estimated 40 percent of CEOs of
Mexico's 100 largest companies and 10 percent of government
bureaucrats are alumni, according to Expansion magazine. In fact,
the Mexican Congress even has a political clique known as ``the
Techies.'' Famed graduates include: Lorenzo Zambrano, the CEO of
the world's third-largest cement company Cemex; Roberto Servitje,
head of Grupo Industrial Bimbo, Latin America's leading bread
maker; Herminio Blanco, Mexican trade minister; and Carlos Medina
Plascencia, speaker of the lower chamber of Congress and member of
the opposition National Action Party.
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, graduates are quickly scooped up by such
multinationals as Microsoft and Procter &AMP; Gamble, which have
donated equipment and sponsored training courses. According to
university statistics, 70 percent of the school's students land a
job within a month after graduation.
 &HT;    Rodrigo Sosa, for example, has his eye on working for a U.S.
company such as General Motors. He is finishing a master's degree
in quality control, which will cost him close to US$8,000 a year in
tuition, but with state-of-the-art training in three-dimensional
design programs and assembly-line robots, he figures the investment
will pay off. ``For my family, it was a necessity that I go to Tec.
For me, it is a great opportunity to become someone important,'' he
says.
 &HT;    The university also coddles its students by offering perks
ranging from a new Olympic-size swimming pool and rock climbing
courses to satellite classes taught by such well-known public
figures as former U.S. President George Bush and Nobel Peace Prize
winner Rigoberta Menchu. Tec students can also participate in
exchange programs with 70 universities, including the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT), Stanford University and the
University of California Los Angeles (UCLA).
 &HT;    ``We are 50 years ahead of education compared with the rest of
the country,'' says State of Mexico Director General Alvarado.
``There is no other school like it in Mexico.''
 &HT;    But while the Tec has always prided itself on being a
leading-edge institution, students agree that great strides have
been made just in the past few years. ``If a student had a computer
five years ago, everyone turned around to look,'' says former
student Ricardo Lopez Castro, who now teaches a two-year course in
Cisco Network operating systems.
 &HT;    The Tec's technological re-engineering has also brought a change
in teaching methodology. Since 1997, professors must not only be
adept with computers but they must rethink their role in the
classroom as part of a new format dubbed the ``redesign.'' The
concept makes students responsible for their own learning and gives
computers a central role. ``The professor is no longer a
transmitter of information, but a facilitator, an administrator of
information,'' says Roberto Dominguez, professor of Latin American
literature.
 &HT;    Moreover, the web has given students more access to information,
causing teachers to offer more concepts than answers. ``For the
first time, students really have to study,'' says Dominguez. Adds
Lopez Castro: ``Before, the focus was on pedagogy and education.
Now we want to change the way a professor teaches and the way
students learn.''
 &HT;    Not all students, however, are able to adapt to these new
teaching concepts and professors say failure rates are increasing.
But those who do graduate complete the Tec's mission statement to
create ``internationally competitive'' students.
 &HT;    Take Danilo Escobedo. The 25-year-old master's candidate is
planning to move to Germany or Chile to work as a music producer
once he finishes his degree next year. Escobedo founded the campus
radio station in 1998 and designed a station web page that can also
be heard. ``I have a competitive advantage in terms of technology,
but the school also taught me how to work under pressure, organize,
administer and budget,'' he says.'' I am more prepared to work
abroad.''
 &HT;    But while the university continues to give its students an Ivy
League education, it also strives to put a human face on a new
generation of graduates. Administration officials are well aware
that many Mexicans blame past technocrats and number- crunchers _
many of who are Tec alumni _ for the neo-liberal economic policies
that have shut out much of the country's 60 million poor. From the
campus' privileged hilltop location, students have a constant
reminder of the nation's poverty each time they gaze on the dusty
concrete homes and dirt roads of the San Mateo slum that scale the
surrounding hills.
 &HT;    As a result, the high-tech university's curriculum also includes
real-world coursework, such as strategic planning for small
businesses. ``We are creating people, not machines,'' says campus
director Alvarado. ``We want students to develop a clear awareness
of what Mexico is all about.''

 c.2000 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features)  &HT;    ATIZAPAN, Mexico _ Cuando Rodrigo Sosa ingreso en el Instituto
Tecnologico hace dos anos, el estudiante de Ingenieria Industrial
no sabia encender una computadora. Ahora, sentado en un banco de un
parque, el estudiante de segundo ano conecta su PC portatil a una
de las 2.300 conexiones de fibra optica que hay en el recinto y
revisa cuatro cuentas de correo electronico y varias salas de
conversacion, mientras escucha las melodias de los Chemical
Brothers, que bajo de la Internet.
 &HT;    Sosa pasa seis o siete horas al dia frente a su PC. Reconoce que
dedica mucho tiempo a jugar Starcraft, un juego de guerra de
realidad virtual. Pero su PC se ha convertido en un instrumento
indispensable para todo lo relacionado con sus estudios.
 &HT;    Sosa pertenece a una nueva generacion de estudiantes del
``Tec,'' quiza la universidad mas avanzada de America Latina en
materia de conexion electronica. En 1997, este instituto de
Monterrey, con 85.000 estudiantes en 30 recintos en todo Mexico,
decidio cambiar las cosas. Cada profesor y estudiante recibieron
una cuenta de correo electronico para conectarse con ConectaTec, la
intranet de la universidad, y con IntraTec, una segunda red a la
que se pueden conectar desde la casa. Estas redes, junto con el
extenso programa de educacion a distancia, ofrecen una gran
plataforma de estudios.
 &HT;    ``El futuro es la tecnologia, y si preparamos adecuadamente a
nuestros estudiantes, ellos seran el futuro,'' dice Emilio
Alvarado, director general del recinto del Estado de Mexico.
 &HT;    El recinto de 26 hectareas en los suburbios del norte de la
Ciudad de Mexico brinda una vision de ese futuro. En agudo
contraste con el resto del pais, donde solo el 3 por ciento de los
nucleos familiares tiene computadora, en el Tec las PC estan por
todas partes. El 80 por ciento de los estudiantes tienen
computadora propia, y el 50 por ciento son portatiles.
 &HT;    Para mejorar aun mas ese alcance, el Tec presento en enero la
tarjeta de radio WaveLAN, de Lucent Technologies, en los recintos
del Estado de Mexico y de Monterrey, convirtiendola asi en la
primera institucion academica mexicana que adopta la nueva
tecnologia a gran escala. La potente tarjeta inalambrica, que
trabaja con 40 antenas diseminadas en el recinto, da a las
congestionadas lineas telefonicas convencionales de la escuela un
acceso ilimitado a la Web. ``El unico lugar donde los estudiantes
no tendran acceso a la Internet es en el bano de las mujeres,''
bromea Alexander Baber, director regional de asociaciones
comerciales de Lucent Technologies en Mexico.
 &HT;    La tarjeta tambien da a los estudiantes la oportunidad de
conectarse con el nuevo portal de Internet del recinto, que tambien
comenzo a funcionar en enero y que ofrece noticias, el estado del
tiempo, un sistema de busqueda de Internet y mucho mas. El comercio
electronico sera una realidad en cuanto el centro reciba la
aprobacion de un banco local.
 &HT;    El nuevo portal es la mas reciente de las innovaciones del
Instituto. En los anos 90, su departamento de Internet diseno
paginas de la Web para el gabinete presidencial, el Congreso
federal, la Secretaria del Medio Ambiente y Petroleos Mexicanos
(Pemex). Este ano creo una tarjeta inteligente de identificacion
que se puede usar para controlar la asistencia del personal y hacer
compras en el recinto.
 &HT;    El empresario mexicano Eugenio Garza Sada, ex presidente del
poderoso conglomerado industrial conocido como el Grupo Monterrey,
fundo el Instituto Tecnologico de Monterrey en 1943, inspirado en
el Instituto Tecnologico de Massachusetts (MIT). En 1950, el Tec se
convirtio en la primera institucion academica de la region
acreditada por la Asociacion Surena de Universidades y Escuelas de
Estados Unidos. En 1963, compro su primera computadora y en 1980
comenzo a dar titulos en ciencias de computacion.
 &HT;    En 1994, la filial en el Estado de Mexico establecio los
primeros laboratorios de computacion de la escuela y no tardo en
convertirse en el centro de prueba de la version local de Microsoft
Windows 95. Seis anos despues, el recinto tiene 15 laboratorios con
400 PC, y una instalacion donada por Intel en enero y dedicada al
comercio electronico. Ese laboratorio, que tiene 15 computadoras
equipadas con el software de comercio electronico de Microsoft y
otras 15 con el programa de IBM, es parte de un programa de
maestria en comercio electronico creado en 1998 donde se ensena
como abrir una tienda virtual, estrategia de negocios, logistica,
etc. Ya tiene 50 estudiantes inscritos.
 &HT;    Estas iniciativas tienen el proposito de preparar a los lideres
del futuro en materia de comercio, pero entre los graduados ya hay
figuras celebres en Mexico. ``Es el MIT de America Latina,'' dice
Baber, de Lucent. Alrededor del 40 por ciento de los presidentes de
las 100 mayores empresas de Mexico y el 10 por ciento de los
burocratas del gobierno son graduados del Instituto, segun la
revista Expansion. En el Congreso hay una camarilla politica
conocida como ``los Techies.'' Entre los graduados famosos estan:
Lorenzo Zambrano, presidente de la tercera compania de cemento del
mundo, Cemex; Roberto Servitje, presidente del Grupo Industrial
Bimbo, el mayor fabricante de pan de Latinoamerica; Herminio
Blanco, secretario de Comercio de Mexico, y Carlos Medina
Plasencia, presidente de la Camara de Diputados.
 &HT;    No es de extranar que multinacionales como Microsoft y Procter &AMP;
Gamble, que han donado equipos y patrocinado cursos de
capacitacion, anden a la caza de graduados. Segun estadisticas del
centro, el 70 por ciento de los alumnos de la institucion consigue
empleo al mes de graduarse.
 &HT;    Rodrigo Sosa, por ejemplo, quiere trabajar para una empresa como
General Motors. Esta terminando la maestria en Control de Calidad,
que le costara cerca de US$8.000 anuales, y dada la capacitacion
avanzada en programas de diseno tridimensional y linea de
ensamblaje robotizada, piensa que vale la pena. ``Para mi familia,
era una necesidad que yo fuera al Tec. Para mi, es una gran
oportunidad de ser alguien importante,'' dice.
 &HT;    La universidad tambien consiente a sus estudiantes con detalles
como una piscina olimpica, cursos de alpinismo, clases por satelite
que imparten personalidades como el ex presidente norteamericano
George Bush y la premio Nobel de la Paz Rigoberta Menchu. Los
estudiantes tambien pueden participar en programas de intercambio
con 70 universidades, entre ellas el MIT, la Universidad de
Stanford y la Universidad de California en Los Angeles (UCLA).
 &HT;    ``En educacion estamos 50 anos por delante del resto del pais,''
dice el director general Alvarado, refiriendose al recinto del
Estado de Mexico. ``No hay otra escuela como esta en Mexico.''
 &HT;    Pero aunque el Tec siempre se ha enorgullecido de estar a la
vanguardia, los estudiantes coinciden en que en los ultimos anos se
ha avanzado mucho. ``Si hace cinco anos un estudiante tenia una PC,
todo el mundo lo miraba,'' dice el graduado Ricardo Lopez Castro,
que ahora imparte un curso de dos anos en sistemas operativos de
Cisco Network.
 &HT;    La reorganizacion tecnologica del Tec tambien ha generado un
cambio en la metodologia de la ensenanza. Desde 1997 los profesores
no solo deben conocer de informatica sino que deben replantearse su
papel en el aula como parte de un nuevo formato apodado el
``rediseno.'' El concepto, que responsabiliza a los estudiantes con
su aprendizaje y asigna a las computadoras un papel fundamental,
significa que ``el profesor ya no es el transmisor de la
informacion, sino un moderador, un administrador de la
informacion,'' dice Roberto Dominguez, profesor de Literatura
Latinoamericana.
 &HT;    Ademas, la Web ha dado a los estudiantes mas acceso a la
informacion, con lo que los profesores ofrecen mas conceptos que
respuestas. ``Por primera vez los estudiantes tienen que estudiar
de verdad,'' dice Dominguez. Y agrega Lopez Castro: ``Antes nos
concentrabamos en la pedagogia. Ahora queremos cambiar la forma en
que el profesor ensena y los estudiantes aprenden.''
 &HT;    Pero no todos los estudiantes pueden adaptarse a estos nuevos
conceptos y los profesores dicen que aumentan los suspensos. Pero
los que se graduan alcanzan la meta del Tec de preparar
profesionales capaces de competir a nivel internacional.
 &HT;    Un ejemplo es Danilo Escobedo, de 25 anos y candidato a una
maestria. Escobedo piensa mudarse a Alemania o Chile a trabajar
como productor musical cuando termine sus estudios el ano proximo.
En 1998 fundo la estacion radial del recinto y creo una pagina
electronica donde se puede escuchar la emisora. ``Tengo una ventaja
competitiva en asuntos tecnologicos, pero en la escuela tambien me
ensenaron a trabajar con presion, a organizar, administrar y hacer
presupuestos,'' dice.
 &HT;    Pero mientras la universidad sigue dando a sus estudiantes una
educacion de primera, se esfuerza por darle un rostro humano a una
nueva generacion de graduados. Los administradores saben muy bien
que muchos mexicanos critican a los tecnocratas _ muchos de ellos
graduados del Tec _ por la imposicion de politicas economicas
neoliberales que han abrumado a los 60 millones de pobres del pais.
Desde la ubicacion privilegiada del recinto en la cima de un cerro,
los estudiantes perciben la pobreza que los rodea cada vez que
observan las polvorientas casas y las calles descuidadas de San
Mateo, en colinas cercanas.
 &HT;    De ahi que el curriculo de alta tecnologia de la universidad
contenga cursos sobre el mundo real, como planificacion estrategica
de pequenos negocios.
 &HT;    ``Estamos formando personas, no maquinas,'' dice Alvarado, el
director del reciento. ``Queremos que los estudiantes tengan una
clara conciencia de Mexico.''

APPEALS COURT REFUSES TO INTERVENE IN SUIT AGAINST CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal appeals court on Friday refused to
interfere in a lawsuit brought by a group that accuses President
Clinton of violating the Privacy Act. But the ruling was still a
partial victory for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The three judges said there was no need to issue an emergency
order sought by the White House to block pre-trial information
gathering, or discovery, in the suit brought by Judicial Watch, a
conservative organization that has been a persistent foe of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, Jim Kennedy, said Friday that White
House lawyers were disappointed by the decision on discovery, but
would submit to it nonetheless. But Kennedy said White House
lawyers were ``very pleased'' by other elements of Friday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals panel sharply criticized a lower court judge who
asserted in a March 29 ruling that the president committed ``a
criminal violation of the Privacy Act'' in releasing personal
letters sent to him by Kathleen Willey, a former White House
volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, Willey accused Clinton on the CBS News program
``60 Minutes'' of making a sexual advance in the fall of 1993. Her
account added to the burdens of the president during the
investigation of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and the
sexual-misconduct lawsuit filed by Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Willey's television appearance, the president
released her letters _ reluctantly, he said _ in the hope that
their friendly tone would undercut her accusations. She had written
them after the supposed sexual advance.
</P>
<P>
   Willey is not a party to the suit by Judicial Watch, which
contends that the White House improperly obtained hundreds of files
from the FBI on former appointees and employees of the Reagan and
Bush administrations. Judicial Watch has focused on the handling of
the Willey letters in the hope of uncovering evidence that might
buttress its allegations involving misuse of the FBI files.
</P>
<P>
   On March 29, Judge Royce L. Lamberth ruled that White House
lawyers should submit to questioning by attorneys from Judicial
Watch. He went further, declaring that Clinton had acted unlawfully
in releasing Willey's letters, which were kept among White House
records. The Privacy Act generally bars release of information
about a person from federal records without that person's consent,
and violations of the law can result in fines.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the appeals judges said Lamberth's ``sweeping
pronouncements'' about supposed criminal activity were
inappropriate, ``entirely superfluous'' and not binding on any
court that might have to weigh the question of criminality.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has contended all along that much of its
business is exempt from the Privacy Act, and that many lawyers from
both political parties have long said so. Friday, the appeals
judges said that, in matters unrelated to the Judicial Watch case,
the White House can continue to operate under that assumption
unless and until a court declares otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1987.
Clinton and his allies have made no secret of their feeling that
the judge is unfriendly to the current administration.

 &HT;    GOVERNMENT STICKS TO TWO-WAY MICROSOFT BREAKUP PLAN
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an amended court filing Friday, the government
stood firmly behind its original plan to chop Microsoft Corp. into
two pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The government's final submission in the historic antitrust
trial came in the form of an sweeping court order that U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson could sign, if he decides to
do so, as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   If put into effect, the order would eventually mandate the
breakup of the software giant while imposing strong curbs on its
business conduct during an inevitable _ and perhaps expedited _
appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft must respond to the updated formula by Wednesday.
After that, Jackson would be free to issue a final decree of his
own design or adopt the government draft as it stands.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, Jackson abruptly cut off further proceedings in
the case and swept aside a Microsoft motion that he summarily
dismiss the government plan. That final hearing was called to
review the remedies that would best cure what the court sees as
Microsoft's abusive monopolistic behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But at that four-hour session, Jackson also questioned whether
the government and 17 states had gone far enough in their plan,
which calls for one company to market the flagship Windows
operating system and the other to sell applications such as
Microsoft Office and the Internet Explorer browser.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, who had earlier presided over a 77-day trial, voiced
a strong interest in splitting the company into a yet a third part
built around the browser and other Internet-related products.
</P>
<P>
   The government needed only five paragraphs Friday to summarize a
series of what it called ``minor, nonsubstantive changes'' to its
original proposal that it had made at Jackson's behest.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was to alter the way the government defines
``Microsoft'' to include the company's officers, directors,
employees, and assignees. Another was to alter the proposed stock
ownership provisions so that only Bill Gates, the co-founder and
current chairman, would be barred from owning shares in both new
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The latter change would accommodate Microsoft's other
co-founder, Paul Allen, who still serves as a director and holds a
large block of stock. It would also exempt Steve Ballmer,
Microsoft's chief executive, from having to sell his stock.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating Microsoft's argument that it was unfairly denied
its day in court, the government urged Jackson to ignore the
company's ``cynical ploy'' of offering Gates and Ballmer as
witnesses at extended remedies hearings. The offer was ``calculated
to raise diversionary issues on appeal,'' the government claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, for his part, has shown no inclination to hear from
either executive.
</P>
<P>
   Following a final ruling, the Justice Department must still
decide whether to send the case directly to the U.S. Supreme Court,
bypassing an appeals court that had overruled Jackson in an earlier
Microsoft antitrust case. The high tribunal must also concur in any
such expedited review.
</P>
<P>
   Solicitor General Seth Waxman, who would argue the case on
behalf of the government, would also have to agree.
</P>
<P>
   In advance of the Memorial Day holiday, Microsoft shares closed
at $61.44, down 6 cents, setting another 52-week low.

   CONGRESS-FOREIGN-POLICY (Washington) _ The most important
foreign policy vote so far this year, the 237-197 House approval of
the China trade deal, was no new affirmation of internationalism in
Congress but a reaffirmation of one of its oldest truths: members
vote their districts. But other foreign policy matters have far
smaller constituencies, and are much more subject to Washington's
political influences, especially partisanship. To put it meanly,
each party plays politics with foreign policy; to put it kindly,
each trusts presidents of its own party but discerns grave
weaknesses on the other side. By Adam Clymer.

   HONGKONG-ECON (Hong Kong) _ Less than three years after a plunge
in the value of Thailand's currency triggered a devastating
economic crisis across much of Asia, the region is riding a wave of
growth reminiscent of the Asian miracle of the 1980s. The latest
evidence of the resurgence came today with a report that Hong
Kong's economic output rose 14.3 percent in the first three months
of the year. It was the territory's fastest quarter of growth since
1987, and seemed to make the Asian crisis a distant memory. Other
Asian economies, from South Korea to Singapore, are growing at

months after being transplanted in a simple procedure resembling a
tranfusion, the cells are still working in all eight patients, half
of whom were treated almost a year ago at the University of
Alberta, in Edmonton. The patients, who had Type 1 diabetes, in
which the body produces little or no insulin of its own, no longer
have any symptoms of the disease. Although they no longer need
insulin to control their blood sugar, they now must take other
drugs to prevent rejection of the transplants. By Denise Grady.

   &QL;  WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 230.
WASHINGTON, May 26 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: AID
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 91 to 4, a $15 billion spending
package that will reduce the cost of federal crop insurance and
provide over $7 billion in ``emergency'' spending for farmers.
Supporters said the package would help farmers in one of the worst
agricultural recessions in recent history. Opponents said the
package was crafted to win favor in an election year. A ``yes''
vote favors the package.

</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 237 to 197, a measure granting
China permanent normal trade relations. The measure lowers tariffs
on U.S. goods going to China and permanently grants the trade
status that had been approved on an annual basis for 20 years.
Supporters said the measure opened up a giant market for U.S. goods
and without the trade status the U.S. would be left out of key
trade deals when China joins the World Trade Organization.
Opponents said it would move U.S. jobs overseas and leave no
incentive for China to improve its human rights record and labor
standards. A ``yes'' vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: AID
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved by a unanimous voice-vote a $15

insurance and provide over $7 billion in ``emergency'' funding for
farmers. Supporters said the package would help farmers in one of
the worst agricultural recessions in recent history. Opponents said
the package was crafted to win favor in an election year. There was
no recorded tally of votes.

&HT;     INTEL CHIP DELIVERS, BUT EXPECT TO PAY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intel Corp., which is used to being the market leader when it
comes to PC processors, was No. 2 when it came to scaling the
gigahertz mountain earlier this year. Advanced Micro Devices beat
Intel to the summit by a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Intel second in delivering a 1-GHz chip, it was
unable to deliver in volume. That's one reason that many PC makers,
including Intel's biggest customer, Houston-based Compaq Computer
Corp., opted to pass on Intel's fastest Pentium III, instead going
with AMD's 1-GHz Athlon.
</P>
<P>
   Those companies that did opt to build computers around Intel's
offering, such as Dell Computer Corp., figured there was limited
demand for a chip this fast _ and this expensive. They also were
counting on changes in the Pentium III's design that would boost
its speed past the Athlon.
</P>
<P>
   Early Athlons were faster in crucial aspects than the first
Pentium IIIs.
</P>
<P>
   So, now you can buy PCs that use Intel's gigahertz chip, but it
will cost you big bucks. But if it's speed you need, you'll find
there's nothing faster.
</P>
<P>
   I looked at Dell's Dimension XPS B1000r. It costs $4,309.
</P>
<P>
   Take a deep breath; calm yourself. Yes, you read that price
right. Four thousand, three hundred and nine smackeroonies. Take
out a second mortgage, sell your car or commit grand larceny, and
you can have this baby sent directly to your door.
</P>
<P>
   And what you'll have, of course, is the fastest Windows-based
computer you can buy. At least, until the next chip upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The model I tried was seriously loaded with goodies, which
boosted the cost. It came with 256 megabytes of high-speed memory;
a 30-GB hard drive that spins at a blistering 7,200 revolutions per
minute; an nVidia GeForce graphics card with 64 MB of DDR
(double-data rate) memory; a 12X DVD-ROM drive; an 8X4X32
rewritable CD-ROM drive; a 56K fax modem; a 10/100 Ethernet card;
Harman Kardon digital speakers with subwoofer; a SoundBlaster Live
sound card; and a 19-inch Trinitron monitor.
</P>
<P>
   There are several items here that kick the price into the
stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   This PC uses memory developed by a company called Rambus that is
supposed to perform better than standard memory. Bumping up from
the standard 128 to 256 MB adds almost $500 to the cost. The 64 MB
GeForce card is $240 more than the standard 32 MB version.
</P>
<P>
   The way Dell has configured the system on its Web site, the
19-inch Trinitron model is the cheapest display option. If you
leave it out completely, it knocks $430 off the price.
</P>
<P>
   By playing with these options, it's possible to drop the price
to just above $3,000, without a monitor. That's still awfully
steep.
</P>
<P>
   You can assuage your feelings of buyer's remorse with the thrill
of raw power. While I was initially skeptical of whether a user
could notice benefits from a 1-GHz chip, I have been convinced. The
Dimension B1000r responds faster than anything else I've tried _
including a 1-GHz Athlon-based Compaq _ and tests bear that out.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons why someone would want a computer this
powerful is for gaming. Serious gamers want the fastest machine
they can get, and don't see the absurdity of spending many
thousands of dollars to play with the fastest rig around. Computer
companies, in an attempt to remain dignified, call these users
``enthusiasts,'' but we know what's really going on here, don't we?
That's one reason why the timedemo feature in Quake III Arena from
id Software has become the de facto standard for testing machines
like this. Nothing stresses all the components of a PC _ from
memory to the graphics card to the processor to audio like this
game.
</P>
<P>
   The 1-GHz Dell did better in the timedemo test than any other PC
I've tried. With Quake III's graphics set to High Quality, the demo
delivered 88 frames per second, compared to 83.8 on the
Athlon-based Compaq. When I switched to the settings I usually use
to play the game, I got 60.4 fps, compared to 55.2 on the Athlon.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, there are several specifications here that boost the
Dell over the Compaq. Both have the same amount of system memory,
but the Dell's is on a 133-MHz system bus (the route data moves
across the motherboard) while the Compaq's is just 100 MHz.
</P>
<P>
   Both use a GeForce card, but the Dell's has twice as much
memory.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when you buy a PC, you're buying the whole package and
not just a processor. Dell has done a good job of building a
superfast system using state-of-the-art components.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't expect to get it for a song.
</P>

&HT;     MUSIC FILES, IMAGE SCANS CAUSE MAJOR UPDATE OF PC SPECS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because the PC industry moves so rapidly, minimum PC
specifications have become a moving target.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, I have created a Web site with my minimum
specifications for different types of shoppers, from budget buyers
to power users. You can find them at my Web site at
www.dwight-ilverman.com/minspecs.htm, where they will be posted _
and tweaked _ year-round. There also is a separate page there with
portable PC recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, here are my current recommended minimum specs for
desktop PCs that would be running Microsoft's Windows operating
system:
</P>
<P>
   Processor: Shop for at least a 450-megahertz processor, either
from Intel Corp. or Advanced Micro Devices. But avoid systems that
share main system memory with the computer's graphics adapter.
These shared-memory designs often limit your upgrade options and
generally feature lower-quality graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Memory: You'll want at least 64 megabytes of RAM, and you may
want to consider 128 MB if you play games. Most PCs now come with
64 MB standard, although some budget systems still offer only 32.
It's worth the $75-$100 it will cost to go up to 64.
</P>
<P>
   Hard drive: A year ago, I was recommending four gigabytes as a
minimum, but the popularity of downloadable music files and home
image scanning dictates that it's time to double that, to eight GB.
If you already have a taste for these kinds of activities, consider
at least 10 GB.
</P>
<P>
   CD or DVD: A 24X CD-ROM drive remains the minimum, with a
DVD-ROM drive as an option. Software hasn't moved to DVD in a big
way, but having one keeps your options open because it also will
read CD-ROM software. If you are considering a rewriteable CD
drive, get one with a 4X write and rewrite speed and 24X read
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Video: My recommendation for video memory also has doubled from
a year ago, to eight MB, again based on the popularity of working
with digital images. More memory lets you display larger images
using more colors. It can also improve display speed, particularly
with 3-D games.
</P>
<P>
   Sound: All PCs come with sound cards that can deliver decent
sound, so you may want to pay more attention to the speakers.
Quality speakers _ particularly those with their own power supply _
can make a big difference in how a PC sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Modems: All PCs come with 56K modems, and the vast majority are
so-called winmodems, in which software does a lot of the work that
hardware used to do. While the current crop of winmodems are better
than in the past, cheap ones can still bring much pain. Look for a
modem that's a brand name.
</P>
<P>
   Monitor: Fifteen-inch monitors with a maximum .28 dot pitch
remain the minimum you should consider. If you can afford it,
consider a 17-inch model with a .26 dot pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Expandability: Some new ``legacy-free'' PCs have no way to
upgrade the system other than through USB connections. If you are
interested in these machines, be sure they come with all the ports
you think you might need, including an Ethernet connection if you
are considering or have DSL or cable-modem Internet service.
Otherwise, look for two free PCI slots, two USB ports and serial
and parallel ports.

   METULLA, Israel _ Ram Eisenberg, an architect from Tel Aviv,
leaned on a barbed-wire border fence on Friday and gazed at the
crowd that was chanting slogans and waving the red and yellow
banners of Hezbollah at the Lebanese village of Kafr Kila on the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you happy?'' he asked the group, many of whom had returned
to southern Lebanon after Wednesday's Israeli troop withdrawal and
came on Friday to celebrate victory at the Israeli border. ``We're
happy for you. Welcome home.''
</P>
<P>
   A Shi'ite Muslim woman covered head to toe in an Iranian-style
black chador said, ``It's our land,'' and Eisenberg agreed. ``We're
happy for you to go home,'' he repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Someone handed him a Hezbollah handbill, which he pocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Then the woman asked Eisenberg if he was Israeli, adding
matter-of-factly, ``If you are Israeli, I kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed, Eisenberg replied, ``I hope you change your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The bizarre encounter, impossible two days ago, was part of the
new reality that has swiftly taken shape here since the Israeli
pullout.
</P>
<P>
   A border crossing that had been run by the Israelis, known as
the Good Fence, where relatives of their Lebanese militia allies
used to come to work in Israel, vanished overnight as the Israelis
moved back to the international boundary.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the area was swamped by Lebanese visitors who walked
and cruised in honking vehicles on their side of the border fence,
hoisting banners of Hezbollah and another Shiite group, Amal, in
full view of Israeli soldiers and visitors to Metulla.
</P>
<P>
   A big yellow banner had the words ``Thanks to Hezbollah.''
Nearby stood a cardboard mock-up of a Katyusha rocket-launcher,
Hezbollah's favored weapon against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The defiant display of support for what Israelis have long
considered an archenemy caused hardly a ripple on the Israeli side.
The soldiers just looked on, and Israeli sightseers, kept at a
distance by the troops, peered at the convoys through binoculars,
trying to identify the militia flags by their colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let 'em blow off steam,'' said Yaakov Orbach, a visitor from
Petah Tikvah.
</P>
<P>
   Moshe Biton, from neighboring Kiryat Shmona, a town that has
been battered by Hezbollah rockets, said as he watched: ``It
doesn't bother me. It's their territory and they have a right to do
what they want, as long as no Israelis are hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivka Sayag, from Holon, chatted on a cell phone with a friend,
describing the spectacle across the fence. ``It's kind of nice,''
she said. ``If we live in peace, it'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the withdrawal, residents of Israeli border communities
have been enjoying just that. After years in which the thunder of
artillery and the clatter of helicopters were the background noise
of daily life, a remarkable quiet has settled over the border zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quiet is ringing in my ears,'' said Yossi Beter of Kibbutz
Lahavot Habashan.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone was happy with the changes across the fence.
Looking through binoculars, Yisrael Abramov, a contractor from
Herzliya, said that Hezbollah's victory celebrations were the
result of a hurried and disorganized Israeli pullout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that they're waving flags and we're not,'' he
said. ``We've lost faith in our flag and country.''
</P>
<P>
   Assi Shaul, a teen-ager from Kiryat Shmona, felt the same way.
``This is a disgrace,'' he said. Climbing a pile of boulders to
look at the flag-wavers on the other side, he shouted, ``We'll burn
you!''
</P>
<P>
   On the Lebanese side, people vented anger at Israel, bitter
after years of occupation, shelling and bombardments that had
caused thousands of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no peace with Israel, because they've killed
children and destroyed houses,'' said Hassan Rashid, a student who
returned to his village, Khiam, after eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Other people said there could be no guarantee of peace along the
frontier, because Israel was Arab land. ``Ask Hezbollah what will
happen,'' a woman shouted. ``If Israel leaves Palestine, there will
be peace.''
</P>
<P>
   There was evident pride that this time the Israelis had been
compelled to withdraw from Arab territory.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A group of Druze from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights arrived
at the border fence from the Israeli side to shre the moment with
the Lebanese. Flashing V-signs high in the air, Saleh Abu Saleh
from Majdal Shams wished for a speedy Israeli withdrawal from the
Golan. ``God willing it will happen soon,'' he boomed. ``Victory to
the Arabs.''
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the slogans and the display of symbols, there were
tentative signs of readiness to keep the border calm.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli soldiers kept a low profile, emerging from their base
only once to remove people on the Israeli side who had approached
the border fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a calm, not peace,'' said Issam Rashid, also from Khiam.
``We agree to be calm here. We are not aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisenberg, the architect, said that his verbal exchange with the
Lebanese across the barbed wire was a modest achievement. ``It was
a chance for them to see that there's a human being on the other
side,'' he said.

&HT;     WORK VISA LAW STILL LACKS TEETH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By L.M.SIXEL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago the White House threatened to veto a bill that
would increase the number of high-skilled work visas available
unless U.S. workers were given first crack at the jobs and weren't
laid off to make room for immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The protections were added, the visa limits were raised and
President Clinton signed the bill into law _ but companies don't
have to abide by it.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Labor Department hasn't gotten around to
issuing the regulations, which, among other things, spell out what
companies have to do to guarantee they haven't laid off any U.S.
workers six months before or after the immigrant came on board or
how they tried to recruit U.S.
</P>
<P>
   workers first.
</P>
<P>
   If the protections were seemingly such a priority with the
Clinton White House, why hasn't the Labor Department put the
regulations on the fast track? A senior Labor Department official
who didn't want to be identified called it ``prosecutorial
discretion.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the department has limited resources and some
things have higher priority than others, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, when the unemployment rate is at a 30-year low,
worker protection isn't one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, older U.S. workers say there is rampant age
discrimination against high-tech workers over 30 and they need
those protections _ especially since about half of the temporary
work permits go to the high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   And even if the Labor Department wanted to issue the
regulations, it's getting a little late. The three-year law is in
effect for only one more year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smith is scratching his head over this,'' said Allen Kay,
spokesman for U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, and chairman of
the House Immigration Subcommittee. Smith was a main sponsor of the
American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Kay said that Smith has repeatedly asked the Labor Department to
give him a status report on whereabouts of the regulations.
Frustrated, Smith held hearings on the regulations Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   John R. Fraser, deputy administrator of the department's wage
and hour division, told Smith's subcommittee Thursday the
department received 90 comments when it asked the public to respond
to the regulations and it's taken time to sift through those
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser also testified the department gave a copy of its proposed
final rule to the Office of Management and Budget in January, a
typical step in the process. After the regulations are reviewed by
OMB for fairness and cost, the department will again review the
proposed regulations, a department spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Regulations can take a long time to develop because so many
different effects have to be measured, said the senior department
official.
</P>
<P>
   There's the environment to consider, along with small
businesses, families, state and local governments, and the
relationship between costs and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, it takes six months to develop regulations but a
year is closer to average, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign worker visa law applies to companies that are
considered heavily dependent on immigrants _ that is, if 15 percent
or more of its work force is working under H1B temporary visas.
Such companies are known as ``job shops'' and they often pay lower
wages to immigrant workers.
</P>
<P>
   The number of H1B visas _ the category for skilled employees who
typically have bachelor's degrees _ increased from 65,000 a year to
115,000 in 1999 and 2000. In 2001, the number falls to 107,500.
</P>
<P>
   M. Nicole Morrison, an immigration lawyer in Houston, isn't
holding her breath waiting for the regulations. Morrison said she
doesn't expect the department to ever issue them because the law is
too convoluted.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what the government is trying to accomplish with
H1B visas, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is also stymied. The Clinton administration is asking to
raise the number of H1B visas to 200,000 per year but hasn't added
any protection for U.S. workers, he testified.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, Smith said the public doesn't much cotton to
increasing the number of immigrants coming in to work. During his
hearing Thursday, Smith cited a recent poll that showed only 20
percent of Americans want the H1B program to expand, while 80
percent are opposed.

   FUNDS WATCH: A Backdoor Buy on Berkshire Hathaway
</P>
<P>
   It's safe to say that Warren E. Buffett has been one frustrated
chief executive of late. Class A shares of Berkshire Hathaway are
down 29 percent from their high in June, 1998. And in Berkshire's
annual report, released in March, the sage of Omaha broached the
possibility of a stock repurchase program to bolster Berkshire's
share price, which would be a first for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Before launching into a buyback, it may behoove Buffett to
consider a less expensive route: shares of Boulder Total Return
Fund, a $203.6 million closed-end fund. As of April 28, the fund
had fully 21.9 percent of its assets invested in Berkshire Hathaway
Class A shares, its largest holding. Another 8.5 percent of the
fund is invested in Berkshire Class B shares.
</P>
<P>
   Like many closed-end funds, Boulder trades at a steep discount
to its net asset value; Boulder's was 28.1 percent as of May 19.
Unlike mutual funds, which redeem and issue shares at net asset
value, closed-end funds issue a fixed number of shares, which may
trade at a premium or a discount.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Boulder, new fund shareholders are in effect
getting almost a third off Berkshire's current price.
</P>
<P>
   For good measure, 1 percent of the fund was invested in Wesco
Financial, an insurance holding company in Pasadena, Calif., of
which Charles T. Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire, is chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   The kicker is that the fund is leveraged. It has issued $77.5
million worth of preferred shares, yielding 4.95 percent, and
invested the proceeds into its portfolio, giving it an added upside
if its portfolio performs well.
</P>
<P>
   The situation has not escaped notice. The fund is recommended in
the June issue of The Investor's Guide to Closed-End Funds, a
monthly newsletter published by Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors in
Miami. Herzfeld, who also manages about $100 million, calls Boulder
Total Return his biggest position, one that will soar as value
stocks like Berkshire come back into favor. ``When the leadership
rotates, the NAV rises and the discount narrows,'' Herzfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   The fund has other interesting twists. Among its top 10 holdings
are three other closed-end fixed income funds: ACM Government
Securities, Putnam Premier Income Trust and Putnam Master
Intermediate Trust. These traded at discounts of 13.3 percent, 17.8
percent, and 18.4 percent on May 19, respectively, and currently
yield 12.2 percent, 11.1 percent and 10.9 percent. So, the Boulder
investor gets a discount on the already discounted assets in those
funds while picking up those especially distorted yields. (Boulder
itself yields 7.6 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Boulder's portfolio manager, Stewart Horejsi (pronounced
Ho-rish), assumed management of the fund last August, after
wresting control from its previous management. According to Carl
Johns, the fund's treasurer, Boulder began buying Berkshire shares
last September at an average price of about $57,000 for each Class
A share. They closed Friday at $57,400.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's shares have returned a negative 11.1 percent since
August, but Johns advises patience. He points out that Horejsi is
in the same boat as they are. His family trust owns 42 percent of
the fund.

THE DOWN SIDE OF PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 28)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN

<P>
   LIMERICK, Ireland _ This is no longer the squalid grotto of
``Angela's Ashes,'' the misnamed town with a lilting title, where
life was grim and grimy, and Frank McCourt's dreary boyhood row
house stank from the backed-up sewer.
</P>
<P>
   Things are now looking up, way up, for Limerick, as for the rest
of the Republic. For the first time, anyone who wants work can find
employment. You can't drive near any town or city without seeing
roadwork under way.
</P>
<P>
   And the massive new system of ``mains,'' as the sewer network is
called, is trumpeted with blue billboards carrying the starred
circle logo of the European Union, informing the Irish that the EU
budget is paying for ``80 percent'' of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   The EU has been good to Ireland, as have the '90s generally, the
tourism boom, and the luck of the economic draw, which has spurred
a doubling of real estate values in the last five years, at the
same time mortgage rates are low at around 5 percent, and people
are flush with cash.
</P>
<P>
   But the speculative property boom triggered a series of massive
and overlapping political scandals involving payoffs, bribes, and
favor-swapping of every description.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of politicians and developers are enmeshed in an orgy of
influence peddling. Each day's headlines bring new revelations of
who got what for doing such-and-such in the property development
game.
</P>
<P>
   With slabs of new housing and shopping malls springing up in
what just was pasture and meadow, with the explosion of high-tech
industry and the sudden influx of returning Irish emigrants coming
home to earn and spend at a far higher level than when they left,
the political system became flush with payoffs and bribery at every
level.
</P>
<P>
   Including the very top. Bertie Ahearn, the popular prime
minister, got $3,000 from a contributor who owned land for which
Ahearn granted tax breaks when he was finance minister. He says he
didn't know who owned it. But his benefactor, Frank Dunlop, is at
the center of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Ahearn's involvement seems marginal, though he's also been
toasted for taking soccer match box seats and free trips to
Manchester United games. But a current member of the parliament,
the Dail, was just caught voting against an inquiry into secret
funding accounts, when it turns out he has one himself. His penalty
was a wrist-slap, a 14-day suspension with pay, which is like
sending a hockey player to the penalty box for two minutes. Dozens
of parliamentarians have been named as recipients of floods of
cash, presumably for votes.
</P>
<P>
   The fixer at the center of the land rezoning grab in Dublin,
George Redmond, 75, former assistant city and county manager, was
paid over $300,000 over 20 years by one developer. ``It developed
almost as a habit,'' Redmond breezily informed a commission of
inquiry. On the average of every 10 days, he'd accept cash that
began as $250 but escalated to $500 a handout.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond, a key official on zoning decisions, would then give
``advice.'' Redmond said he acted as a consultant ``on an
installment basis.'' He said he got the money partly out of
``affection.'' The value of an acre of prime industrial land might
double or treble, depending upon how the county government ruled on
its future use, and Redmond garnered a fortune.
</P>
<P>
   The presiding judge accused Redmond of ``a selective case of
amnesia'' for getting vague on sums and coconspirators.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Dunlop was another fixer on a grand scale at the national
level. He's testified he once gave $50,000 in cash to ``a powerful
individual.'' The public inquiries have become daily media fodder.
Germany is enmeshed in its own fund-raising scandal, but Ireland's
is broader and deeper. ``Our sleaze is up there with the best of
Europe,'' boasts the Irish Times.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing the words of both fixers' testimony, Irish Independent
columnist Sam Smyth concluded: ``Getting George Redmond to admit
anything is like asking Frank Dunlop to deny something . . .. Frank
describes every donation he made to politicians as a bribe, then
George says he did nothing but give some developers `general
assistance and advice' to become a millionaire.'' The columnist
characterized Redmond as ``the recidivist old liar'' and Redmond as
``the repentant bag-man.''
</P>
<P>
   As in the United States, reformers are divided over how to
resolve the eternal dilemma of money in politics. Ahearn says there
is no support for full public funding. There is a debate over
banning corporate contributions in favor of individual ones; both
types are legal now. The public and the papers are fed up. ``Power
and money,'' hissed an elderly female shopkeeper in the South
coastal town of Timoleague. ``Please God the Irish still have
enough common people with their both feet on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The Irish Independent's editorial after two days of fruitless
debate on the subject was equally glum: It ``does not inspire much
public confidence that we will see early reforms. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   But the public is caught up in the Roaring '20s atmosphere of
rampant prosperity, displaying a widespread contempt for the
money-grubbing pols and bureaucrats, and the venal developers who
fueled their habit. Ireland's economy grew a staggering 11 percent
last year, four times the EU average. All the numbers are going up:
consumer spending up 9 percent over the year, retail spending up 14
percent, industrial investment up 25 percent just in last year's
third quarter. The new danger is inflation. With membership in the
Euro Zone, Ireland cannot raise interest rates by itself; that has
to be done by the new European central bank. So the government's
only braking power can come from raising taxes _ which is never
easy anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Houses outside Dublin proper are going up in price at the rate
of 2 percent per month, surpassing a $125,000 average. Union
leaders demand fresh price controls so that the 50,000 new homes
built this year overall can be be bought by workers.
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity has a downside. Last year 37 percent of drivers
stopped by police on suspicion of drunken driving tested positive
for drugs. A lot of poor and underclass teens have become
glue-sniffers and school dropouts. And the cynicism and apathy
churned up by the money scandals will poison the well when it comes
time for politicians to take hard decisions on inflation.

PICTURE THIS FOR FALL: A NEW TV LINEUP THAT ISN'T NEW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Network television's annual rite of passage arrived and departed
last week with the usual bravado and high drama, but the
announcement of the 30 or so series that will fill prime time this
fall also had a sense of deja vu.
</P>
<P>
   This is the time of year when the networks lick their
post-sweeps battle wounds but are energized by the notion of wiping
the slate clean and by fall lining up shoulder-to-shoulder at the
starting gate.
</P>
<P>
   Network presidents, production studio heads, high-level
executives and publicists are able to push their series and not be
laughed at for a lack of truth in advertising. For instance, the
project starring ``Seinfeld's'' Michael Richards, about a bumbling
private eye, was reportedly so poorly conceived and crafted that
NBC sent it back to the drawing board. But it didn't deter the
network from placing the unseen new version on its schedule and
sticking ``highly anticipated'' in front of its title.
</P>
<P>
   Commercially and creatively, the Big Four networks (only UPN
gained in audience numbers) are coming off a dismal year, if not a
rather odd one that will only get more complicated next season. The
biggest story of the season was the phenomenal success of ABC's
quiz show ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire,'' which energized the
network's schedule, skewed the ratings wars and is dictating ABC's
strategy for fall.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings and revenue races aside, the unexpected success of the
game show gave ABC so much scheduling leverage that it pushed the
development of its own slate of series to the back burner; it also
cut into the ratings of any other program it happened to face in
its time slot, with the exception of ``ER.'' One question is
whether ABC is compromising long-term programming for short-term
gain.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, game shows and other reality series with big-money
payoffs followed the lead of ``Millionaire,'' which will be spread
over four nights, perhaps five or even six next fall as ABC milks
its popularity and, at the same time, sabotages the ratings of its
competition.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the other game shows has come close to duplicating
``Millionaire's'' success. Only one of the three game shows
introduced since ``Millionaire'' will return for a second season.
That's why, on May 31, CBS _ with a mixture of excitement and
trepidation _ is premiering ``Survivor,'' about marooned islanders
battling over a million-dollar payoff.
</P>
<P>
   The new series being offered by the six broadcast networks
differ only slightly in concept and tone from last season and, come
to think of it, each season since 1990. You can easily see how
ABC's ``Geena,'' with Oscar-winner Geena Davis as a career woman
who must readjust her life for her new guy and his two kids can be
mistaken for Shelley Long's 1998 fiasco ``Kelly Kelly,'' or that
the 14-year-old coping with his cash-poor family in NBC's
``Tucker'' sounds a lot like ``Malcolm in the Middle.'' There's
also the male version of ``Providence,'' called ``Ed,'' starring Ed
Cavanagh, who had a recurring role on ``Providence.'' It, too, airs
on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its faltering but still sizable audience, network
television remains tentative when asked to challenge its
cookie-cutter mentality, partly because ``shows that think outside
the box,'' as producer Tom Fontana puts it, take longer to catch on
with viewers, who are comfortable with proven formulas. (Perhaps
Fontana was referring to his cop drama ``The Beat,'' which, with
its mix of documentary style and live action, was a bit much.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the failings of a show like ABC's ``Sports Night,'' which
will not return but could turn up on cable, was its inability to
connect with viewers, who found the dialogue smug and its style of
moving freely between comedy and drama jolting and confusing.
</P>
<P>
   While the sameness of new shows is a familiar story, never has
the gap between the acting talent assembled on screen and the
mediocre material seemed so wide.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that first-rate actors are, year after year, tossed to
the wolves with third-rate scripts and weak supporting casts hasn't
deterred the networks from trying mightily again.
</P>
<P>
   Next season's star power includes Bette Midler, Gabriel Byrne,
John Goodman, Andre Braugher, David Alan Grier, Delta Burke, Katey
Sagal, and ``Wings'' stars Tim Daly and Steven Weber.
</P>
<P>
   None of their shows sounds that intriguing, although I'm dying
to see ``Don't Ask,'' the Goodman sitcom where he plays a gay man
who recently left his wife and family. Grier, terrific as an improv
player on ``In Living Color,'' plays a Secret Service agent demoted
to the job of protecting the first lady, played by Burke in NBC's
``DAG.'' In ``Madigan Men,'' on ABC, Byrne is Benjamin Madigan, a
divorced architect back in the dating game. Sagal is a prissy
perfectionist who must contend with the home invasion of a sister
and her 14-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   Midler's ``The Bette Show'' is already being touted by
advertisers as a hit, but the same thing was said of Nathan Lane's
``Encore!Encore!,'' which failed to last a season, and Tom
Selleck's ``The Closer,'' which suffered similar humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is high on Davis' ``Geena,'' if only for the fact that she's
a well-known film actress. Someone needs to tell these programming
executives that film stars on their way down rarely bring along the
built-in audience they seek. Braugher's return as a doctor in ABC's
Gideon's Crossing is equally interesting because he was considered
one of the standouts in an unusually strong ensemble cast on
``Homicide: Life on the Streets.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Gideon's Crossing,'' set for ABC, Braugher will be in his
emotional element as a doctor who cares deeply for his patients.
But it's hard to say whether audiences will actually follow
Braugher solo.
</P>
<P>
   Other shows already gaining promotional steam are those with
producers who have delivered hits. ``The $treet'' is about Wall
Street traders, but more important, it's produced by Darren Star,
architect of HBO's smoldering series about female singles, ``Sex
and the City.''
</P>
<P>
   Star's return to the networks is surprising, because the former
producer of ``Beverly Hills, 90210,'' ``Melrose Place'' and
``Central Park West'' left in disgust, saying the censors were
killing his creativity. Network money may talk loudly, but imagine
what he'll come up against now that he's had a taste of cable's
do-whatever forum.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is already figuring on David E. Kelley's ``Boston Public,''
an expos on high-school teachers, as a potential hit, even though
his ``Snoops'' didn't make it to Christmas and ``Ally McBeal'' has
fallen apart in overall quality. It would be nice to see Kelley
regain his focus and turn out another gem.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Wolf, whose WB drama ``D.C.'' died quicklypads his Law &AMP;
Order franchise on NBC with ``Deadline,'' about a newspaper
columnist.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is remaking ``The Fugitive;'' Fox is taking chances on
``Fearsum,'' a thriller from the makers of ``The Blair Witch
Project;'' and Aaron Spelling returns to NBC with the drama
``Titans,'' a serial (what else?) about a 26-year-old fighter pilot
who returns to Beverly Hills (where else?) and finds his rich
family torn apart.
</P>
<P>
   As for diversity, Grier, Braugher and Mykelti Williamson are
leads or co-leads, and it's hard to say how big a role Chi McBride
will play as a principal in Kelley's ``Boston Public.'' (James
McDaniels has said, what, four words on ``NYPD Blue'' in several
years?)
</P>
<P>
   While Ruben Blades is also a co-star in ``Gideon's Crossing,''
Hispanics are upset that CBS passed on the Edward James Olmos drama
``American Family.''
</P>
<P>
   Because NBC will air the Summer Olympics in September, the
official start of the season won't begin until sometime in October.
That will put the batch of new shows against the baseball playoffs
and World Series, which will lead into November sweeps, which will
lead into December's Christmas episodes and reruns.
</P>
<P>
   By January, when midseason replacements are hoping to fill
vacancies, it will be difficult to know which shows have potential
and which do not.
</P>
<P>
   I, for one, am looking forward to the disruptions. Anything that
can bump network TV out of its formulaic sleepwalking would be a
welcome change.

Selleck's ``The Closer,'' which suffered similar humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is high on Davis' ``Geena,'' if only for the fact that she's
a well-known film actress. Someone needs to tell these programming
executives that film stars on their way down rarely bring along the
built-in audience they seek. Braugher's return as a doctor in ABC's
Gideon's Crossing is equally interesting because he was considered
one of the standouts in an unusually strong ensemble cast on
``Homicide: Life on the Streets.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Gideon's Crossing,'' set for ABC, Braugher will be in his
emotional element as a doctor who cares deeply for his patients.
But it's hard to say whether audiences will actually follow
Braugher solo.
</P>
<P>
   Other shows already gaining promotional steam are those with
producers who have delivered hits. ``The $treet'' is about Wall
Street traders, but more important, it's produced by Darren Star,
architect of HBO's smoldering series about female singles, ``Sex
and the City.''
</P>
<P>
   Star's return to the networks is surprising, because the former
producer of ``Beverly Hills, 90210,'' ``Melrose Place'' and
``Central Park West'' left in disgust, saying the censors were
killing his creativity. Network money may talk loudly, but imagine
what he'll come up against now that he's had a taste of cable's
do-whatever forum.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is already figuring on David E. Kelley's ``Boston Public,''
an expos on high-school teachers, as a potential hit, even though
his ``Snoops'' didn't make it to Christmas and ``Ally McBeal'' has
fallen apart in overall quality. It would be nice to see Kelley
regain his focus and turn out another gem.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Wolf, whose WB drama ``D.C.'' died quicklypads his Law &AMP;
Order franchise on NBC with ``Deadline,'' about a newspaper
columnist.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is remaking ``The Fugitive;'' Fox is taking chances on
``Fearsum,'' a thriller from the makers of ``The Blair Witch
Project;'' and Aaron Spelling returns to NBC with the drama
``Titans,'' a serial (what else?) about a 26-year-old fighter pilot
who returns to Beverly Hills (where else?) and finds his rich
family torn apart.
</P>
<P>
   As for diversity, Grier, Braugher and Mykelti Williamson are
leads or co-leads, and it's hard to say how big a role Chi McBride
will play as a principal in Kelley's ``Boston Public.'' (James
McDaniels has said, what, four words on ``NYPD Blue'' in several
years?)
</P>
<P>
   While Ruben Blades is also a co-star in ``Gideon's Crossing,''
Hispanics are upset that CBS passed on the Edward James Olmos drama
``American Family.''
</P>
<P>
   Because NBC will air the Summer Olympics in September, the
official start of the season won't begin until sometime in October.
That will put the batch of new shows against the baseball playoffs
and World Series, which will lead into November sweeps, which will
lead into December's Christmas episodes and reruns.
</P>
<P>
   By January, when midseason replacements are hoping to fill
vacancies, it will be difficult to know which shows have potential
and which do not.
</P>
<P>
   I, for one, am looking forward to the disruptions. Anything that
can bump network TV out of its formulaic sleepwalking would be a
welcome change.

NEW ACTIVISTS ARE NURTURED BY POLITICIZED CURRICULUMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS HEDGES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was no surprise to find students among the union activists,
environmentalists and church groups protesting the policies of the
World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund in
Seattle and Washington in recent months. After all, whether the
cause has been union organizing, the anti-war movement or a nuclear
freeze, college students have been a fixture at demonstrations for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   What is new is that many professors and students see a link
between this latest generation of activists and the overtly
political courses that have been added to college curriculums in
recent years. Postcolonial studies _ an attempt to look at the
legacy left by the major powers on the developing world _ seem to
be a frequent reference point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Postcolonial studies have helped students understand issues
such as political asylum, immigration, the prison industrial
complex and human rights,'' said Dr. Barbara Harlow, who teaches
English at the University of Texas. ``Postcolonialism has enhanced
the intellectual base and helped make academia self-conscious about
its place in national and international politics. It has raised the
hopes for a new radicalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Purnima Bose, an assistant professor in the English
department at Indiana University in Bloomington, agrees. ``We have
a generation of undergraduate activists we did not have a year
ago,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bose helped revamp her department's program two years ago to
include works that are considered classics by postcolonial
scholars. She said many of her students had joined campus activist
groups that protested the NATO bombing in Yugoslavia, the sanctions
against Iraq or the use of sweatshop labor.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Mark, a 25-year-old spokesman for Global Exchange who took
part in the demonstrations in Seattle and Washington, said he was
influenced by the professors who taught postcolonialism when he was
a student at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   The political edge to such courses infuriates critics. Harold
Bloom, a literary critic who teaches at Yale and New York
University, said postcolonial studies were part of a larger
movement that embraces gender studies and the new historicism and
is infected with ``the disease of Resentment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All aesthetic and cognitive standards have been overturned in
favor of this ideological prejudgment,'' said Bloom. ``They have
taken over positions of power within the academy. They are zealots,
commissars. They have severely wounded humanistic education in the
English-speaking world.''
</P>
<P>
   But postcolonial scholars make no apologies for the political
context of their work. ``It does represent a political viewpoint,
but that is not a bad thing since everything does anyway,'' Harlow
said. ``It contributes to setting the record straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Homi K. Bhabha, a professor at the University of Chicago and a
leading expert in the field, said: ``This kind of work is changing
the way the academy sees its role in the outside world and the way
activist organizations deal with cultural issues like domestic
abuse, film and literature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point, students did this through the Peace Corps,'' he
said. ``Now they do this through courses. The academy has brought
social justice areas in a global context into the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   The field of postcolonial studies arose in the 1980s. Many of
the professors were involved in nationalist or leftist liberation
movements supporting causes like divestment in South Africa,
guerrillas in El Salvador and the Palestinians. They were committed
to shifting the traditional perspective, looking at the world from
the vantage point of the losers instead of the winners. For
example, Edward Said's 1979 book ``Orientalism,'' which harshly
criticized Western scholars as having a distorted view of Arabs or
the Muslim Orient, became a seminal work.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the primary home for postcolonial studies was not
political science, but literature. One of the most important early
essays of the postcolonial movement was ``Three Women's Texts and a
Critique of Imperialism,'' which Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, a
professor in the English and comparative literature department at
Columbia University, wrote in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Spivak, who was born in India, looked at Charlotte Bronte's
``Jane Eyre,'' Jean Rhys' ``Wide Sargasso Sea'' and Mary Shelly's
``Frankenstein'' from the perspective of the colonized. She
attacked Bronte and readers who held up Jane as a feminist ideal,
exalting her at the expense of Rochester's mad Creole bride Bertha,
who is confined in the attic. Spivak argued that this was a tacit
acceptance by the British of the systematic repression of colonial
subjects: that it was on the back of Bertha that Jane Eyre rose to
domestic supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not interested so much in criticizing Charlotte Bronte
as I was in showing how the greatest talents become victims of
their time,'' Spivak said.
</P>
<P>
   That essay unleashed similar exercises. Professors began to
examine what it meant for Othello to be a Moor, and the notion of
political asylum in ``The Hunchback of Notre Dame.''
</P>
<P>
   Bose said that Indiana University's English department had
dropped its three-semester survey course in English literature,
replacing it with works that chart the spread of English in
relationship to empire. Novels like ``Sitt Marie Rose'' by Etel
Adnan, ``Cracking India'' by Bapsi Sidhwa and ``Last Night Another
Soldier'' by Aly Renwick have became required reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is initially a good deal of resistance to this
literature because it is so outside the experience of these
students,'' Bose said. ``They often want to pathologize people in
these countries as being more prone to conflict. But the literature
sucks them in. They identify with the characters and start to
question the information they get from the mainstream media.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But even practitioners concede that at times such scholarship
has been hobbled by its advocacy role. The voice of the persecuted,
of what was referred to as the ``authentic'' underclass, has often
been rigidly defined and used to drown out dissenters. Many got
caught up in the identity wars that consumed various ethnic, racial
and gender groups over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The search and quest for authenticity became a tyranny,'' said
Bhabha.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as the national liberation movements took power or
dissipated in countries like El Salvador and Nicaragua, so did the
utopian visions of their advocates. The focus, for those following
the struggles of postcolonial nations, shifted from supporting
leftist political movements to supporting the work of
nongovernmental institutions like Human Rights Watch or Doctors
Without Borders. The old models, the struggle between East and West
or the colonists and the colonized, have evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a major shift,'' said Harlow. ``There was a sense of
loss. Solidarity work sustained us for a long time. We are trying
to work out a new political space.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of today's students are aware of the activist past of their
teachers. ``Most of our professors are speaking about the damage
that is caused by globalization,'' said Hannah Cole, 21, a senior
at Yale who took part in the demonstrations during the IMF meeting
in Washington in April and is one of the leaders of the Student
Alliance to Reform Corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these professors are former activists,'' Cole said.
``Professors openly critical of big corporate structures risk
getting fired or losing their funding, but they try to transmit the
passion they once had to us.''

DEAN &AMP; DELUCA OFFER FACES UNCERTAIN MARKET APPETITE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Kan., Calif., Mass.)   (For release Sun., May 28)  
 By SANA SIWOLOP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When it comes to Dean &AMP; Deluca, the Soho retailer of
fine food and gorgeous kitchenware, New Yorkers are happy to spend
$30 a pound for smoked swordfish or $2.00 for an Asian pear.
</P>
<P>
   But will investors prove as eager to put money into Dean &AMP;
Deluca stock when the company offers shares in its initial public
offering, expected in five to six weeks?
</P>
<P>
   As of last Friday, Dean &AMP; Deluca _ which hasn't turned a profit
in seven years _ had not set a price for the offering, nor had it
announced how many shares it would make available. But the company
hopes to raise about $69 million to finance a major expansion.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things an investor is likely to glean from the
prospectus is that Joel B. Dean and Giorgio DeLuca, the company's
founders, are no longer minding the store. Leslie G. Rudd, who
holds 64 percent of Dean &AMP; Deluca's shares, has been chairman since
September 1995.
</P>
<P>
   While Dean &AMP; Deluca's flagship venue on lower Broadway remains
one of Manhattan's famed culinary temples, the company has been
gradually opening stores nationwide for the past decade, and
channeling money into its catalog and Internet businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Dean &AMP; Deluca operates four other stores, in Washington;
Charlotte, N.C.; Leawood, Kan. (a suburb of Kansas City); and St.
Helena, Calif. The company wants to open one or two specialty
stores next year, and three or four stores in each of the five
years thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Dean &AMP; Deluca's expansion outside Manhattan and online has not
come cheaply. According to the prospectus, it has not been
profitable since the end of February 1993, a fact that must leave
purchasers of Dean &AMP; Deluca's $34-a-box rugelach scratching their
heads. Because of its expansion plans, the company expects to incur
sizable losses for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it lost $8.9 million on sales of $59.6 million,
compared with a loss of $5.7 million on sales of $49.3 million in
1998, and a loss of $9.3 million on sales of $34.4 million in 1997.
As of Jan. 30, it had $17.1 million in cash. Total debt stood at
$3.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the market for specialty foods _ Dean &AMP; Deluca's largest
business _ is growing, as is demand for premium-priced wine and
upscale kitchenware. The prospectus forecasts United States sales
of specialty foods alone to reach $54 billion by 2002, up from
about $38.8 billion in 1997. Forrester Research, a market research
firm in Cambridge, Mass., estimates that sales of specialty foods
online will rise from $248 million in 1999, to $6.3 billion in
2003.
</P>
<P>
   So the company's expansion makes sense, industry analysts say.
``Specialty food customers are the best food customers,'' said Phil
Lempert, the editor of the Lempert Report, an industry newsletter
in Santa Monica, Calif..
</P>
<P>
   But competition is increasing. The Internet gives consumers
access to the Web sites of food manufacturers, not just retailers.
Evie Black Dykema, a Forrester analyst, cautions that online
grocers, like Webvan Group, and general retailers, like Amazon.com,
are expanding their specialty food offerings, too.
</P>
<P>
   Lempert, for one, isn't surprised by Dean &AMP; Deluca's losses. He
thinks the future of specialty food retailing lies in companies
either creating strong, content-filled Internet sites that keep
customers coming back for more products, like Amazon.com, or
building superstores of 40,000 square feet or so, that can generate
high sales. Dean &AMP; Deluca's new outlets will average just 10,000 to
15,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Like a number of other food analysts, Lempert thinks the
retailer's Web site needs a makeover. Dean &AMP; Deluca is planning
such an overhaul, according to the prospectus, and will increase
product offerings and add new features. It also plans to use its
catalogs to promote its Internet business more vigorously by
sending out about 13 million catalogs this year, compared with 4
million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the climate for new issues is tepid. According to Steven
Tuen, director for research at IPO Value Monitor, a research firm
in New York, food-related initial offerings historically have not
fared well, with many sinking below their offering prices.

SATURDAY COMICS WORLDWIDE HONOR PEANUTS' CREATOR SCHULZ 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS SMITH   The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Comics pages in newspapers around the world
will be pretty much all-Peanuts on Saturday as a tribute to 50
years of humor and insight from the late Charles Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow cartoonists had hoped to surprise Schulz with the salute,
which they set in motion before he became ill in November. He was
77 when he died of cancer at his home in Santa Rosa in February.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the National Cartoonists Society decided after
Schulz's death to continue with their plans and to honor him
posthumously by including allusions to him and his globally beloved
Peanuts characters in May 27 strips.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unprecedented, nothing that has ever been attempted
before,'' said illustrator Rick Stromoski of Connecticut, an
officer in the cartoonists group.
</P>
<P>
   Stromoski said about 95 percent of all syndicated cartoons, on
newspaper comics pages and the editorial pages, will feature
drawings of, or references to, Schulz and members of Charlie
Brown's gang.
</P>
<P>
   Garfield checks out what it's like to sleep on the roof of a
doghouse. Cathy imagines the perfect man to possess the combined
virtues of the Peanuts gang. Hagar the Horrible sports a Charlie
Brown zigzag shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz's colleagues chose Saturday as the day to honor 50 years
of Peanuts because the National Cartoonists Society is meeting that
day in New York City for its annual conference and awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, before Schulz was diagnosed in November with
metastasized colon cancer, was that Schulz would attend the
conference and would open his Saturday newspaper to find nearly all
of the cartoons dedicated to him and his half-century career. Then,
on Saturday night, his peers had planned to present Schulz with a
lifetime achievement award.
</P>
<P>
   Although Schulz did not live to meet again with his peers and
spend a weekend talking about his favorite subject _ cartooning _
the cartoons honoring him will appear in newspapers as planned, and
on Saturday night in New York the society will present a lifetime
achievement award to his widow, Jeannie.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz's syndicated comic strip debuted in seven newspapers Oct.
2, 1950. Peanuts became the most popular strip in history,
translated into more than 20 languages and published in 2,600
newspapers around the world. The United Feature Syndicate is now
distributing reruns of Peanuts strips.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz, a native of Minnesota, moved to California in 1958. He
was working at his studio in Santa Rosa Nov. 16 when he told
employees he had pain in his legs and he wasn't feeling well.
</P>
<P>
   Following emergency surgery on a blockage in his abdominal
aorta, he disclosed he had been diagnosed with colon cancer. He
died in his sleep at home Feb. 12.

   The newcomer is coming on strong in the race for the Senate seat
from New York. A new Zogby International poll shows Hillary Clinton
and Rick Lazio in a statistical dead heat. Lazio just entered the
race last week, 14 points down. The new numbers have Clinton at
45.8 percent and Lazio at 43.8 percent. The survey's margin of
error is almost 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   LAZIO'S HOUSE SEAT IN PLAY
</P>
<P>
   When Rick Lazio announced his Senate candidacy last week, his
New York House seat was left invitingly open to Democrats seeking
to gain a majority in the House. ``It puts us in a difficult spot
right now in two ways,''said Suffolk County Republican chairman
Tony Apollaro. ``We need to find a candidate and we need to finance
a candidate.'' They'll meet within the next week to sort through a
short list of possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   NOT PRO-LIFE ON THAT END OF IT
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush said today he supports the use of DNA testing if
it can ``erase any doubts'' about a murder case, but he still
stands firm in favor of the death penalty. Bush said capital
punishment deters crime: ``I believe it sends a chilling message
that there is a consequence to your actions.'' He made the comments
from Texas during a videoconference with the Catholic Press
Association, meeting in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   IS HE OR ISN'T HE?
</P>
<P>
   The National Abortion Rights Action League threw its support
behind Hillary Clinton as her new GOP opponent's record on abortion
was attacked by activists on both sides. While NARAL accused Rick
Lazio of being anti-abortion, the Right to Life Party said his
position isn't nearly good enough for them. ``Rick Lazio is
pro-abortion; he can't get around it, it doesn't matter what NARAL
says,'' said Ken Diem, chairman of the Right to Life Party, which
says it intends to run its own Senate candidate.
</P>
<P>
   JUST THE SAME, HE'S GOT BETTER THINGS TO DO
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush will be skipping next month's Republican state
convention in Houston. Four years ago, the the party denied him a
governor's traditional role of leading the state delegation to the
GOP national convention. And rules changes by the Texas party two
years ago could deny Bush the traditional governor's say in who'll
attend the convention. But Bush spokesman Karen Hughes said his
schedule is built around winning the presidency, not any past
disagreements with Texas Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   `WARM-UP' DEBATES A POSSIBILITY
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is kicking around the possibility of doing a
couple of early debates with Al Gore, perhaps as soon as late
summer, according to the New York Daily News. Some close close
aides believe one or two summer debates make sense, the Daily News
said. The rationale: Early debates would demonstrate that Bush
isn't afraid to duke it out and would lower the stakes for the
three fall debates. ``The more he does, the better he gets,'' one
Bush aide was quoted as saying. ``And it reduces the pressure on
him for October.''
</P>
<P>
   A GUY FOR THE LONG HAUL?
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush may be a fun date, but he's not the kind of guy
you want to settle down with. So says the chairwoman of the Texas
Democratic Party, Molly Beth Malcolm, one of more than 70
Democratic officials from 34 states who met in Nashville with Al
Gore and his senior campaign staff. The officials said they
recognized that voters seemed to like Bush's personality more than
Gore's, but they suggested that the more voters saw of Bush, the
less they'd like him.
</P>
<P>
   THERE MIGHT HAVE TO BE SOME HALFTIME ADJUSTMENTS
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore reassured the national Democratic leaders meeting with
him that his campaign has a winning strategy. Several of the
Democrats said they were comfortable after their pep rally and
strategy session that Gore's lagging poll numbers aren't a serious
problem _ yet. Gore later told supporters at a $1 million
fund-raiser night that he expects ``a good healthy, hard fight
ahead of us and we're going to win it. And we're going to win it
solidly.''
</P>
<P>
   RUBBING SHOULDERS WITH MINORITIES
</P>
<P>
   With camera shutters clicking at his meetings with South African
President Thabo Mbeki and then with retired Gen. Colin Powell,
George W. Bush promoted U.S.-South Africa relations and
volunteerism, a pet issue of Powell. Trailing Al Gore among black
voters, Bush is making a concerted effort to court minorities by
surrounding the governor with a sea of brown and black faces. In
Detroit earlier this week, it was a row of inner-city school
children.
</P>
<P>
   IF IT'S BUSH, YOU CAN BET ON POWELL BEING SOMEWHERE, TOO
</P>
<P>
   Colin Powell said that although he's ruled out being George W.
Bush's running mate, he wouldn't close the door on a possible
Cabinet job a possible Bush administration. ``In any other
capacity, one has to listen when a president asks you to consider a
job,'' Powell said. Bush told Powell to be ready for a call.
</P>
<P>
   GIULIANI TO GIVE SOME OF IT UP
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Giuliani said he'll return $2.8 million to people who
contributed to his aborted Senate campaign and ask them to send
their money to Rick Lazio instead. Giuliani also said he'll
campaign with Lazio next week. Giuliani, who raised $20 million for
the race, has spent $13.8 million. Election laws require that
Giuliani give donors back the money they earmarked for the general
election rather than the primary; that's $2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   FOREIGN POLICY ADVANTAGE TILTING?
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, it was widely perceived that one of Al Gore's
biggest advantages over George W. Bush was his foreign policy
experience. But Gore's foreign policy advantage may be waning. Bush
went to Capitol Hill to fight for the China trade bill, which
passed in the House, while Gore maintained a relatively low profile
on the issue because an ally, organized labor, opposes it.
</P>
<P>
   SOME WANT TO KNOW WHO'S PAYING
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the Federal Election Commission welcomed a proposal
to require interest groups to identify their donors when they air
TV ads meant to influence elections. Republicans were opposed, but
they agreed to let it move forward. The commission's division along
party lines reflects a similar sentiment in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE OUTSIDE, LOOKING IN

<P>
   The Log Cabin Republicans of Texas, criticizing the state
Republican Party for not reaching out to gay and lesbian voters,
pledged to set up an exhibit booth outside the party's upcoming
state convention. ``Our group's message is simple: One can be a
Republican and oppose discrimination,'' said Steve Labinski, the
group's president. Log Cabin contends the Republican Party of Texas
has refused to respond to its request to operate an information
booth inside the state political convention June 15-17 in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   SOME SEE SAFETY IN LOW PROFILE
</P>
<P>
   Being Jewish may be closer to irrelevancy in American politics
rather than the handicap it once was may have been. The list of
potential Democratic vice presidential candidates includes at least
three Jews: Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman, ex-Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin and California Sen. Dianne Feinstein. But
some Jews, particularly in the older generation, worry that
anti-Semitism lingers below the surface in society and could erupt
if too much attention is paid to too manyJews who become too
prominent.
</P>
<P>
   BUCHANAN SHAKING UP THE PARTY
</P>
<P>
   The growing likelihood that Pat Buchanan will secure the Reform
Party's presidential nomination and the $12.5 million in federal
campaign money that goes with it has created another element of
conflict within the loosely organized, often chaotic party. Some
Reform leaders are trying to draft Ross Perot for a third
consecutive run. Another group is pushing for Green Party candidate
Ralph Nader. Still others are urging the leadership endorse no one
this year.
</P>
<P>
   THIRD PARTIES ON BOTH SIDES
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore was once seen as the clear beneficiary of a third-party
candidate, but not any more. Pat Buchanan, who bolted the
Republican Party last year, has yet to demonstrate he will
seriously hamper George W. Bush. But there's scattered evidence
that Ralph Nader, the veteran consumer advocate, could be
troublesome for Gore, especially in Western states the Democrat
will need to put together a winning Electoral College map.
</P>
<P>
   HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S LOOKING FOR
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a new warning by a prominent religious conservative,
James Dobson, against selecting a running mate who supports
abortion, George W. Bush called himself a ``pretty independent
thinker'' whose main criterion for choosing a vice presidential
nominee was an ability to assume the presidency. ``I'm looking for
someone who could be president, someone able to fill that job,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   HUFFINGTON'S RECORD ABOUT TO GO DOWN
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Wall Street exec Jon Corzine already has spent almost $27
million going after the Democratic Senate nomination in New Jersey.
That's more than three times as much as anyone has ever spent on a
Senate primary and within striking distance of the most ever spent
on an entire Senate election. That record is held by Republican
Michael Huffington, the oil millionaire who lost to Sen. Dianne
Feinstein (D-Calif.) in 1994. His campaign cost nearly $30 million,
$28 million of which came out of his own pocket. Corzine's
opponent, ex-Gov. Jim Florio, has spent $1.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   PROUD DADDY AT GRADUATION
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush greeted his twin daughters' high school
graduation day in Austin with ``a tear in my eye'' and a plea to
the media to give them a little space. The 18-year-old fraternal
twins, Barbara and Jenna have told their parents they want to stay
out of the spotlight as their father seeks the White House. This
fall, Barbara will follow in the family footsteps and go to Yale.
Jenna is staying home to attend the University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   WHITE HOUSE INTEREST? WHO, HER?
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton said she understands why some people are
skeptical about her intentions in running for the Senate, but
insisted she wouldn't use the seat as a stepping stone to the
presidency in 2004. ``I don't blame people for being skeptical,''
she said during a voter forum. ``I feel I owe it to the people of
New York to serve a six-year term.''
</P>
<P>
   THAT WHAT YOU CALL REAL INDIAN GIVING
</P>
<P>
   California is the state where the most money is spent on
political campaigns. And in recent years, California's Indian
tribes have become the biggest-spending special-interest group in
the state, pouring about $114 million into campaigns since 1998.
Most of that money was spent on a successful one-time effort to
pass ballot measures permitting expansion of reservation gambling.
The second-biggest-spending interest group in the state, according
to Common Cause: the state's prison guard union, giving $1.9
million to candidates over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   AND IF HE EVER GETS THEM IN THE RING
</P>
<P>
   In a soon-to-be-published account of his first year in office,
Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura uses his trademark blunt language to
tout his accomplishments, explain his forays into controversy and
thrash the media. With ``a few honorable exceptions,'' the ex-pro
wrestler says in a final chapter added to a forthcoming paperback
edition of his autobiography, ``I Ain't Got Time to Bleed,'' the
media are ``corrupt, shameless and irresponsible as hell.''
</P>
<P>
   BUT THEY WISH HIM BLISS JUST THE SAME
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich was a contribution magnet as speaker of the House,
but his big donors seem to have disappeared. Gingrich and former
congressional worker Callista Bisek plan to marry Aug. 18, and
their electronic Macy's registry, online magazine Salon reports,
shows plenty of pricey gifts remaining on their wish list,
including all the linen, bath accessories and all but one plate of
their wedding china. Most of the purchases have come in flatware,
by far the cheapest category.

BEHIND THE VELVET ROPES OF NEW YORK'S NEWEST CLUBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 28)  
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you're the kind of person who likes to meditate to
the pounding beat of Run DMC, is there a club for you.
</P>
<P>
   It's Spa, a cavernous new dance scene on East 13th Street, which
has boldly attempted to graft a New Age ethos _ waterfalls! plants!
_ with a sound system so loud it makes your teeth chatter.
</P>
<P>
   So overwhelming is the decibel level that the club has hired a
jockey-size man whose job, apparently, is to take orders from
patrons, jump up on the bar (boing!) and tell the deafened barkeeps
what to mix. This lephrechaun-like go-between then hands the drinks
back to the customer.
</P>
<P>
   I thought I was watching some obscure alcoholic Olympic event.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the surreal sights encountered during a recent
expedition around the night-life circuit, those mythical grounds
behind the velvet ropes, where club owners are constantly juggling
concepts and looks to try to satisfy the city's fickle night
crawlers.
</P>
<P>
   It is brutally competitive terrain, which has recently seen the
arrival of several major contenders for the crown of ``it'' club.
Before everyone who's anyone leaves for the summer, of course. The
roster includes three handsome new downtown establishments, Lotus,
Eugene and Luahn, which have each built good advance buzz with
private parties for gossip column-worthy outfits like Inside.com,
GQ magazine and the talent agency International Management Group.
These three newcomers joined two late 1999 entries, Centro-Fly and
Chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Brazilian-theme danceteria called Saci, which
opened in March off Times Square, and promptly became known as a
favorite spot of Sean Combs, which, of course, can be a mixed
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   With the no-dancing lounge scene feeling more and more tired,
night-life entrepreneurs are diversifying, creating increasingly
ambitious hybrids. Lotus, for example, fuses a restaurant, lounge
and nightclub into a single, three-level space _ divided, of
course, by a velvet rope or three.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken a $3.5 million bet that people want to dine,
lounge and dance all in one space,'' said Jeffrey Jah, a former
promoter at the defunct Life nightclub, who is a co-owner of Lotus.
``We want to be everything to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   His partner Mark Baker put it more succinctly: ``You have so
many slightly older guys _ 28 to 40 _ who are most comfortable
sitting in a lounge sipping cocktails and seeing their friends. But
their 22-year-old model girlfriends want to dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Lotus; that is, when it does enter. Originally scheduled
to open in mid-May at 409 West 14th Street, the club is now aiming
for a June 8 opening. ``The policy at the door is to be friendly,''
Jah promised.
</P>
<P>
   This could be a trend. Many seemingly haughty door folk often
defy expectations. Last weekend I found easy, unannounced access to
such roped-off establishments as Serena, Joe's Pub, Moomba, Veruka
and Lot 61.
</P>
<P>
   Not that some places are not still practicing the ancient art of
sidewalk humiliation. For a demonstration of this ego-brutalizing
contact sport, I recommend Halo, a subteranean Greenwich Village
club whose crack two-person door team (he is big, she is blonde)
rejects all who aren't very goodlooking or flashing $5,000 shoulder
bags. Once inside the former after-hours club (49 Grove Street),
the beautiful, multi-racial crowd basks in fine amber lighting and
in the glow of celebrities like Harrison Ford and Taye Diggs.
</P>
<P>
   If you get in, of course. But it was here, on a recent Saturday,
that a bespectacled young man heard four of the most dreaded words
in masculinity: ``No more men tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that I was too upset. With their ever-present promise of
supermodels, $11 cocktails and long lines at the bathroom, many of
these ``scene'' clubs feel interchangeable. (Note to design
departments: There ought to be a permanent ban on red banquettes
and little white table candles.)
</P>
<P>
   After all, there were plenty of other places to go.
</P>
<P>
   I had begun my Cook's tour the night before at Luahn, a
lounge-cum-restaurant on Fifth Avenue near 13th Street. Luahn is
the brainchild of Jason Strauss and Noah Tepperberg, two promoters
in their mid-20s, who also run the club Conscience Point in
Southampton. (Stephen Baldwin, the Baldwin brother in those M&AMP;M
ads, is also a co-owner.)
</P>
<P>
   Already popular with the fashion set, Luahn (59 Fifth Avenue)
easily has the most velvet ropes per square foot of any
establishment in town. Visitors who get past the ropes outside are
immediately greeted by another set leading to the lounge
downstairs, manned by members of some new pro-stubble cult. Once
inside the lounge, there's even a third rope, on the back stairs
leading to and from the bathroom, guarded by an unhappy looking
fellow who apparently didn't know that the Census Bureau is still
hiring.
</P>
<P>
   For all that _ probably because of all that _ the lounge at
Luahn has the feeling of a hot-and-getting-hotter scene. The crowd
was standing-room-only last Friday at 11:30 p.m., as was the line
at the door. Some of that may be the size of the place; the lounge
fits about 50 average-size people comfortably or 75 models.
</P>
<P>
   The decor is minimal: red banquettes, little white table
candles, amber overhead lighting. The single decorative flair is a
series of small, blue-tinted X-rays framed on one wall. And, of
course, the kitchen-cam. Part of Luahn's see-and-be-seen vibe is a
series of small video monitors located around the restaurant and
lounge showing a live feed of the restaurant's kitchen. The idea,
Strauss said, is to allow ``patrons to watch their food prepared.''
Of course. The crudites will be televised.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anybody was looking at the monitors the night I was
there. Imitating the natives, I slouched behind a small table to
take in the scene, whereupon my cool was immediately under assault
from an over-enthusiastic middle-aged man. A Joe Pesci look-alike
with heavy-rimmed glasses, this gentleman began dancing while still
seated, launching into a sort of head-rolling, shoulder-gyrating
break dance. He looked as if he was being Rolfed.
</P>
<P>
   His suffering, and the overpacked crowd, left me longing for a
quieter, more peaceful domain.
</P>
<P>
   I chose Spa. As they often say in jail, it seemed like a good
idea at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Opened in April, Spa (76 East 13th Street) is the direct
descendant of Life, the popular Bleecker Street dance hall that
closed last year. Several staffers from Life helped establish Spa,
and their influence is felt. The music is loud, the covers steep
and the crowd turnover heavy.
</P>
<P>
   That said, at 1 a.m. on a Saturday morning, there was a swarm of
people seeking admission. A security staff strolled the sidewalk,
warning people to remain in line. There were barricades and beefy
bouncers and vacant-eyed, clipboard-wielding doorwomen.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, on the other hand, the theme is the healing power of
water. Overhead video screens flash underwater scenes, the bar
stocks 16 varieties of bottled water and if you lean against the
slated walls you can hear water running.
</P>
<P>
   Holistic pretensions aside, Spa is all about commotion. Visitors
pack its bars three deep and the lines to the bathrooms (decorated
like saunas, get it?) snake out their doors. The club also traffics
in such notions as a two-bottle minimum (liquor, that is, not
water, at $250 a bottle) for all who wish to occupy its white
leather booths.
</P>
<P>
   In a booth elevated over the dance floor, Grandmaster Flash, the
DJ, lead the crowd through all manner of hip-hop, disco and rap.
The Virgil-like character guiding me and a date through the scene
was a polite fellow named Gianpaolo (``But everyone calls me
J.P.''). He lead us to a booth, one of about a dozen that circle
the main dance floor. ``This area is usually completely filled with
celebrities,'' Gianpaolo said.
</P>
<P>
   I had to take his word for it. I did spy, on the other hand, a
pair of ``American Psycho,'' Wall Street types in the next booth.
What did they think of Spa?
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is bullish,'' one said. Or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   Spa also has a back room, a quieter, classier space where the
minimum-bottle business is less strict and the music is devoted to
rhythm and blues, trance and pop.
</P>
<P>
   We returned to the dance floor, where the crowd continued to
grow, and where I encountered, no kidding, another polyester rope,
this time in front of the bar. There, sitting on top with his legs
dangling, was the gymnastic man whose job it is to take my order.
He heard me out, jumped back atop the bar and efficiently delivered
a small plastic cup of cocktail. Diana Ross was singing, ``I'm
Coming Out.'' I drank my drink and did the same.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   While Spa is the newest, a couple of other recently opened dance
spots offer variations on a similar theme. The red-curtained
environs of Chaos (225 East Houston Street) are impressive, as are
its exotic sounding hideaways _ the Neptune Room, the Red Salon.
But the club also subscribes to the same obnoxious policy requiring
the minimum order of a bottle of pricey Champagne or liquor to
secure a table, and it is often beset by around-the-corner lines.
</P>
<P>
   The motif at work at Centro-Fly, meanwhile, at 45 West 21st
Street, is futurism, which from a decorative standpoint apparently
means Op Art spirals, plentiful plexiglass and a door staff dressed
in orange jump suits.
</P>
<P>
   Centro-Fly, which boasts a state-of-the-art DJ booth, has been a
hot spot since opening in December, drawing big crowds of
electronic music aficionados and just plain dancing fools. The
night I dropped in, the music was high-volume house, accompanied by
eye-dazzling lights. Toward the back is a dark hallway that leads
to the club's restaurant and lounge, a sleek, sedate space where
the walls are painted with a series of perspective-twisting
paintings. (The future, apparently, will not smile on realism.)
</P>
<P>
   It would be an ideal space for nondancers to drink and gossip _
it has a slight Los Angeles feel _ except for the fact that one has
to enter through the dance club, with its $20 cover, to get there.
(If you make a reservation for dinner, the cover is waived.) The
owners say they will soon open a separate entrance. I endorse that
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after a complete weekend out, I felt slightly
under-fabulous. There was only one solution: I would Moomba.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the newcomers, for sheer celebrity quotient, the
prize still goes to that mother of all swank lounges, Moomba (133
Seventh Avenue South, near 10th Street). On the Monday night I
visited, the door to the third-floor V.I.P. room was crowded as
usual, with about 15 would-be hipsters bantering for entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, dude,'' said one suited young man to the skinny fellow at
the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes?'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dude?'' said the suit, with a lilt in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   He might as well have been saying goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   The draw on this particular Monday, as it has been for the last
month, was karaoke, that cheesiest of art forms, which has somehow
snuck back intact from suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   The karaoke evening is overseen by Samantha Ronson, the
tomboyish younger sister of the celebrity DJ Mark Ronson. Her idea
for the evening is simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get them drunk enough,'' she said, ``and anybody will sing.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd upstairs was wobbling room only, a sight reminiscent
of Moomba's very first days back in 1997, when Leo once juggled
four models at a single table and began work on his second chin. A
small stage is set up near the windows, lighted by a single
rose-colored spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   As I entered, the words of Tommy James' ``Mony Mony'' were
scrolling across the wall, and two buxom blondes were leading the
crowd in a cheer of ``Get laid, Get . . .''
</P>
<P>
   My attention was drawn away by Jeff Gossett, Moomba's
soft-spoken majority owner, who still spends an inordinate amount
of his time shuffling celebrities from door to table and table to
door. He gave me a quick lay of the land: the crowd included the
television talk-show personality Lisa Ling, the actors Liev
Schreiber and James Van Der Beek, the model Yasmine Bleeth, members
of the rock bands the Foo Fighters and the Black Crowes and ``some
of those guys from that show `Popular.'''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   There was also ample evidence of disposable income; a gentleman
to my left put his cigarette out in my drink and offered to buy me
another.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   As I stood watching a soulful version of ``New York, New York,''
a well-dressed, bald, snaggle-toothed man approached me, eyed my
notebook and said: ``You should talk to me. I'm a big celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah right, buddy, and I'm the Duchess of Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   He asked my name and I asked his.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Moby,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, it was Moby himself, the multi-platinum DJ, who
told me he is between European and American tours.
</P>
<P>
   He is not a singer by trade, of course, but this is his night;
he was clutching a bulky black notebook with the titles of hundreds
of potential karaoke songs. He had already made his choice: ``What
a Wonderful World'' by Louis Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lure is watching celebrities humiliate themselves,'' he
said, a minute before taking the stage. ``And watching women
pretend to enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Moby began to sing in a quivering voice, and for
a few minutes the din subsided. When he finished, the crowd went
wild.
</P>
<P>
   Moby slipped quietly out of the club _ I later spotted him
eating falafel in the East Village _ but the crowd kept cheering
for him.
</P>
<P>
   They seemed happy, having gotten what any decent prowler of the
night demands: an experience they couldn't have had anywhere,
anytime else.

KEY SHAREHOLDER OF COMMERZBANK SEEKS MERGER OR OVERHAUL 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Hansgeorg Hofmann says he is no corporate
raider. But if Hofmann has his way, Germany's fourth biggest bank
will lose its independence.
</P>
<P>
   Hofmann, head of a small investment group called Cobra, has
acquired voting rights to 19 percent of the stock in Commerzbank AG
and he arrived at the bank's annual shareholders meeting Friday
with what management regarded as a chilling message.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he had received ``signals'' from potential buyers,
Hofmann warned that the bank's executives should brace for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have consolidation everywhere in the industry, whether you
think that is a good or a bad thing,'' Hofmann said. ``The world is
different now and the banks do not have too much time to reorient
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Hofmann is leading the kind of corporate crusade practiced by
Americans like T. Boone Pickins in the 1980s. Marching under the
banner of shareholder value, he has become what amounts to
Commerzbank's biggest shareholder and hopes to engineer a merger or
alliance for the bank that will allow his group to cash out with a
big profit.
</P>
<P>
   Cobra itself has acquired little if any actual stock. But it
says it has obtained options and voting rights to 19 percent and
could raise its share to 30 percent, enough under German law to
veto major decisions.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a month of polite exchanges with Hofmann,
Commerzbank's chief executive, Martin Kohlhaussen, denounced him
Friday, calling his assertions dangerous and irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   Kohlhaussen was particularly incensed by Hoffman's claim that
Commerzbank's value was about 50 euros a share, far higher than its
current price of 38.11 euros.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual public clash comes more than a month after Cobra
announced it had accumulated a stake in Commerzbank and wanted to
help the bank define its strategy.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Hofmann said he hoped to increase Cobra's stake
from 9.9 percent to 19 percent. Throughout the process, he has
portrayed his group as interested in mediating a friendly deal, not
a hostile takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Hofmann's main partners are Klaus-Peter Schneidewind and Clemens
Vedder, who control Rebon, a Netherlands investment group that is
Cobra's parent company. Schneidewind and Vedder have been involved
in takeovers elsewhere in Europe, but Hofmann, who ran Dresdner
Bank's investment banking business until 1996, is the main
strategist on the Commerzbank investment.
</P>
<P>
   All three men were highly visible at Friday's shareholder
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   They denied any interest in breaking up Commerzbank and selling
it off in pieces, but left little doubt they could apply pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we needed to assemble a blocking minority, it could be
done,'' Hofmann said.
</P>
<P>
   German bank executives have been speculating about possible
buyers. Kohlhaussen recently softened his long-held opposition to
any merger and said he might be open to talks with Dresdner Bank,
Germany's third largest.
</P>
<P>
   Dresdner had reached a deal to merge with Deutsche Bank AG,
Germany's biggest bank, but the deal collapsed over the future of
Dresdner's investment banking subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Hofmann has suggested that a merger with a foreign institution
would be better for Commerzbank.
</P>
<P>
   Many candidates have been rumored, including Citigroup, ABN Amro
of the Netherlands and HSBC Holdings of Britain.

   Angelina Jolie lives on the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Forget planning. Forget the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am always right in the moment,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, the moment dictated that the screen beauty
would dye her hair a color best described as ``grandmother blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, her advisors went berserk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told, `You know, Angelina, people are taking you
seriously now. You've got to take yourself seriously,''' Jolie
says, mimicking the voice of a Hollywood agent.
</P>
<P>
   She sighs and says, ``People are suddenly concerned about my
hair? Please. I was like, `I don't think we fooled anyone.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jolie, 25, delights in making waves. This is a woman who
literally jumped in a swimming pool in her ballgown after winning a
Golden Globe Award for ``Gia'' (1998).
</P>
<P>
   She isn't adorned with jewels but with tattoos, including a
large ``H,'' which stands for Haven, her brother's middle name.
Recently she took a plunge of a different sort and married actor
Billy Bob Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   No one even knew the two actors, who met on the set of 1998's
``Pushing Tin,'' were dating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, when I'm 90, they will never be able to say, `Oh, she was
just another boring starlet,'' Jolie says.
</P>
<P>
   That's an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Even her clothes are with that Jolie twist. She isn't wearing
DKNY or Ralph Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try Walmart,'' she jokes, allowing those ridiculously puffy
lips to burst into a smile. ``Hey, it was the only thing that was
clean. I don't have time to go to the cleaners.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, her career is in overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   Jolie stars opposite Nicolas Cage and Delroy Lindo in ``Gone in
60 Seconds,'' opening June 9. It's the story of two rival car thief
gangs who have 24 hours to prove which group can ``collect'' the
most merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do the film because it was high art. It was my summer
vacation last year and frankly I wanted to learn about cars,''
Jolie confesses.
</P>
<P>
   She learned a few practical tips from someone who really knows
his wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do know how to steal a car now, although maybe I shouldn't
get that out there,'' she says. ``We actually had a real thief on
the set escorted by his prison guard. I didn't know who they were
the first time. I thought they were two prop guys and then I got
the skinny. I asked the thief a million questions and this guy
could rip apart an entire car and tell you every single part of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget logic. Jolie says that after ``The Bone Collector''
(1999) and her Oscar winning turn as mental patient Lisa in ``Girl,
Interrupted'' (1999), she was ready for some screen fun.
</P>
<P>
   But Jolie cautions that she's still a serious actress. In fact,
that's why she turned down one of the leads in the upcoming big
screen version of ``Charlie's Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Charlie's Angels' people had a few selling points,''
Jolie says. ``They told me there weren't many good characters for
strong women. But I countered that I've been able to play strong
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was also told that doing `Charlie's Angels' `will make you a
big star,' which is frightening and not a plus in my book,'' Jolie
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at it as a money job. Given the fact that I don't
really like to get dressed up in high heels, it wasn't worth it to
me. I figured that my fun job was `Gone in 60 Seconds.' And
frankly, I thought car thieves and hanging out with the boys was
just so much cooler.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanging out on the A list in Hollywood leaves her cold.
</P>
<P>
   Jolie, who is the daughter of actor Jon Voight and actress
Marcheline Bertrand, says she isn't overly impressed with her
newfound status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I have the same acting abilities. It's not like I'm
suddenly a better actress because I have awards or this box office
clout,'' she says. ``It's just that now I'm on more covers of
magazines. It's easier to hire me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I don't take my successes personally,'' Jolie says.
``I still think I'm someone who got very lucky. I'm someone who
people took a chance on a few years ago when I was no one in this
town. And now? I don't think I'm so important. I'm just an actress
for hire.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't think that she has a poor self-image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am secure in the fact that I do have something to offer as
an actress,'' Jolie says. ``I've done justice to my roles. I've
always felt that I was the best person to do the roles that I've
been offered. In fact, I still won't take a role unless I think I
am the best person to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jolie felt that way about her Oscar winning role in ``Girl,
Interrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved that movie. I got to fling the windows open and just
breathe and scream. It felt so good. I got to push buttons,'' Jolie
says.
</P>
<P>
   It follows that she loves characters facing internal conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a side of me that understands conflicted emotions,''
Jolie says. ``For instance, when I'm intense, I might be crying but
a whole other side of me is angry that I'm crying. You know, if I'm
soft I hate myself. I don't do self-pity. I want to scream, `I am
not weak!'''
</P>
<P>
   She mentions that being so tough isn't easy either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of those people who need to learn to let somebody hug
me. I need to learn to need other people,'' Jolie says.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Billy Bob Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   Jolie shocked the world by marrying Thornton. Said Jolie
recently, ``I'm madly in love with this man and will be until the
day I die.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jolie, who's first husband was actor Jonny Lee Miller,
mentioned that marriage frightened her somewhat because of the
split of her own parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``But anything is a possibility,'' Jolie said. ``I know I've
become more stable. I've become more centered. I feel like I've
grown up a lot in the last year.''

 By IAN SPELLING  
 c.2000 Ian Spelling  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though warm as a campfire and always soft-spoken, animator Don
Bluth, the man behind such features as ``The Secret of NIMH''
(1982), ``An American Tail'' (1986), ``All Dogs Go To Heaven''
(1989) and ``Anastasia'' (1998) calls a spade a spade, consequences
be damned.
</P>
<P>
   There's a no-nonsense tone in his voice, an edge that just might
benefit his latest animated epic, ``Titan A.E.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-directed by Bluth and his longtime partner, Gary Goldman,
``Titan, A.E.'' unfolds in 3028, as aliens called the Drej destroy
the Earth, leaving a million survivors stranded in assorted drifter
colonies. One survivor, a cynical 20-year-old name Cale (voice of
Matt Damon), learns that he is genetically coded to be a map that
will lead to the Titan, a ship with the power to create a new
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the earlier films I've done in my career are pretty
much in the area of Disney wannabes,'' Bluth says by telephone from
a screening room in Phoenix, where he's racing to finish the film
in time for its June 16 release. ``They would have a terminal
disease, a terminal disease that I call cute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is very soft and round and cute and harmless.
That's what Disney is. We tried to shift over to an edgier picture
with `Titan A.E.,' one that's not a wannabe. We were hunting for
something that had a little more quills on it, that was more
prickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of digs in the dialogue, a lot of sarcasm.
It's faster paced than most of my films. I don't think people can
look at it and say it's in the Don Bluth style.''
</P>
<P>
   Bluth laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing,'' he adds.
``I have no objectivity about this film. All I know is that it's
very different from anything I've done before.''
</P>
<P>
   Bluth and Goldman weren't supposed to make ``Titan A.E.'' They'd
crafted ``Anastasia'' at Fox's fledgling animation facility in
Arizona, followed that up with a direct-to-video sequel, ``Bartok
the Magnificent'' (2000), and then sat empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Fox president Bill Mechanic then phoned Bluth and Goldman. The
two directors assigned to ``Titan A.E.,'' (then called ``Planet
Ice'') were off the project. Mechanic asked Bluth and Goldman to
pick up the baton, warning that time was of the essence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had fewer months than we'd ever had before, but we said,
`If there's nothing else ready, we don't have much choice, do
we?''' Bluth says. ``So we grabbed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And like any good soldier I surrounded myself with sci-fi
brains who seemed to know all the genre movies that had ever been
made. I said, `Tell me why some sci-fi movies are really, really
exciting, why some of them work so well.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bluth, his predecessors had sunk $30 million into
artwork and scripting before he ever put ink to acetate. Damon,
Drew Barrymore, Bill Pullman, Nathan Lane and Janeane Garofalo had
already recorded dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Starting over, however, was out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `We're going to take this artwork and reorganize it,
so it's something we can use.' I had a really good art director and
production designer. We shuffled through all of this stuff and
said, `OK, here's what we're going to do.' That seemed to work out
really well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, when I got into the picture, it seemed to me that the
entire focus was on the hardware. I thought, `Who wants to look at
just hardware?' I was reminded that a lot of people do. But a movie
to me is about character, about how personalities come together,
how they relate to each other and what the ramifications of that
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went back, crammed in more of the character material,
re-recorded some of the dialogue, and now character drives the
story. We were on this film for many months, and even in the last
week, new lines were being written.''
</P>
<P>
   And now that the film is about to be released, Bluth must face
his greatest nemesis: the Mouse House. As it has for ages, Walt
Disney Pictures will pit one of its own animated features directly
against Bluth's. ``Fantasia 2000'' will open nationwide on the same
day ``Titan A.E.'' hits the screens.
</P>
<P>
   One might think there's enough room in the world for a few
animated success stories. Bluth, however, doubts that Disney feels
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would often get angry,'' says Bluth, who toiled for Disney
as an animator on such films as ``Robin Hood'' (1973) and ``Pete's
Dragon'' (1978). ``I used to think, `How could they be so
uncharitable?' But business is business. I think that's the way
they look at it, that all is fair in business and they don't mind
who they kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney is the giant. Even though I'm working with Fox, I still
think of myself as the David. Disney has a lot of muscle and I
don't suppose anybody really knows how much muscle they do have.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can block and can do anything they have to do to make
sure they win. And it's all done with a very beautiful veneer, so
no one ever suspects there's anything sinister underneath it.''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters further, there's more at stake with ``Titan
A.E.'' than meets the eye. It's conceivable that Fox might give up
on animation entirely if ``Titan A.E.'' tanks. Dreamworks, which
will release ``Chicken Run'' this summer, surely can't abide too
many disappointments along the lines of its most recent effort,
``The Road to El Dorado.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anastasia is in the black at this point, but it didn't really
go out there and change the world one bit,'' Bluth says. ``So we
went in for a second one and I believe everyone is saying, `Well,
if this one doesn't work, then what?'
</P>
<P>
   ``In tandem with what we've been doing is Katzenberg (and
Dreamworks). `Prince of Egypt' was going to blow the world away and
it didn't. It's not in the black yet. Right after that they did
`Road to El Dorado.' It was a little disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless somebody steps up, throws a spear and hits the coconut,
I think we're sort of pronouncing our own doom. It's no secret that
Fox has laid off a lot of our staff. A lot. There were 360 (people)
and it's down to 60. So there's a lot at stake.''

EAGLE'S DON HENLEY REVEALS HIS WIFE AND KIDS INSPIRED NEW ALBUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Includes a color slide of Don Henley.) 
 ATTENTION EDITORS: The following material from The New York Times
Syndicate is for use by STARBEAT clients. Nonsubscribers can use

 By GARY GRAFF  
 c.2000 Gary Graff  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in 1984, Don Henley _ the once and future singer-drummer
for the Eagles _ lamented in song that there was ``Not Enough Love
in the World.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, on his first solo album of all-new material in 11 years,
Henley informs us that ``I'm very, very happy/And I know that's not
what you'd expect from me at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Henley isn't kidding. He's been married since 1995 to Sharon
Summerall, a fellow Texas native. Together they moved from
California to a home outside Dallas, where they're raising three
children. He has found a life's calling outside music in the Walden
Woods Project, an environmental preservation organization. And this
year, he and Eagles partner Glenn Frey are being inducted into the
Songwriter's Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the spirit of bonhomie saturates Henley's new
album, ``Inside Job.'' There are still plenty of pointed social and
political commentaries amid the 13 tracks, but they're balanced by
songs that celebrate the happy state of his home life, including
``Nobody Else in the World But You,'' ``Taking You Home,''
``Everything is Different Now,'' ``My Thanksgiving'' and
``Annabel,'' a lullaby for his oldest daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has certainly had an inspirational effect,'' Henley, 52,
says of his family. ``At the risk of sounding like I've been in
some sort of self-help program _ which I haven't _ I've
rediscovered my better self. I feel in my mind and in my heart like
I did when I was in my early 20s, when I was in college _ and I'm
not drunk or high!''
</P>
<P>
   Henley is quick to add that he's always considered himself an
optimist, and as a songwriter he felt his mission was to point out
that things could be better. But he also acknowledges that the
sweet tenor of ``Inside Job'' will catch off guard those who are
used to the sharp observations of past hits such as ``Dirty
Laundry,'' ``Sunset Grill,'' ``All She Wants to Do is Dance'' and
the Grammy winning ``The End of the Innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has crossed my mind that it might not be very well received
or it might even be ridiculed in some quarters,'' says Henley, who
moved to Los Angeles during 1970 with his band, Shiloh, before
joining Linda Ronstadt's band and subsequently forming the Eagles
in 1971. ``But you know, I don't (care) anymore. This woman and
these children have helped me to rediscover myself, and I don't
mind putting that out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a very liberating thing for me. I've gotten so
much strength and courage from my family that I can afford to be
totally open and honest about how I feel. If people like it, great.
And if they don't, that's great, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Henley has not run out of dragons to slay, however. ``Workin'
It,'' the first single from ``Inside Job,'' offers Henley's take on
the current state of American society. ``They're Not Here, They're
Not Coming'' pokes fun at the the UFO disciples, while ``Damn It,
Rose'' was inspired by a friend's suicide and deals with what
Henley calls ``empty rebellion.''
</P>
<P>
   But where those kinds of songs used to dominate his albums and
seep into his other material, Henley feels they don't burn within
him in quite the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can always go home to the children and to the wife and the
world goes away for a little while,'' Henley says. ``That gives me
the strength and the serenity to live with those things. But, yes,
it has heightened my awareness and, yes, it has made me more angry.
But I think that's balanced because my life is more balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Henley _ who left his former label, Geffen, to move to Warner
Bros. for ``Inside Job'' _ does have a new battle he's waging. He
and some other artists, including his former backup singer Sheryl
Crow, Billy Joel, Bonnie Raitt and Hole's Courtney Love, have
joined forces to combat the music industry and Congress over what
the musicians feel are actions that are being taken to strip them
of their rights to own their work.
</P>
<P>
   Henley explains that the 1976 Copyright Act provided for the
full return of an artist's work to that artist after 35 years. But
the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), which
represents the record companies, has quietly inserted an amendment
_ tagged on to an unrelated bill _ that re-classified recordings as
work for hire, which allows the labels to own them forever.
</P>
<P>
   This is part of the ``greed fest'' that has followed the recent
spate of entertainment industry mergers, Henley says, and he feels
that ``it's just the first shot across the bow from the record
company. I think they're going to keep on trying to ... cheat
artists out of the rights to their work.''
</P>
<P>
   Henley expects the amendment to be passed into law, and he
expresses frustration at a lack of willingness he's encountering
from other artists to lend their voices to the protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artists have managed to get organized for all other causes _
for the rain forest, for the environment in general, for
anti-nukes, for cures for cancer, for the homeless, for hunger ...
all manner of charity work we've done,'' Henley says. ``But we've
never been able to get our s--t together for ourselves. And we're
getting reamed in Washington by the record companies, by the
Internet companies, by big business in general. If we're not
careful we're going to sleep through it and have all our rights
taken from us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really want this younger generation of rock 'n' roll artists
(to join the cause). I know they resent a lot of us '70s artists. I
know (Smashing Pumpkins leader) Billy Corgan doesn't think very
highly of people like me. But whether they like me or my generation
or not, there's work to be done in the artistic community, and in
the world community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they all develop a social conscience at some point,''
he adds. ``They probably have one, but there's a lot of ways you
can waste your time thinking you're doing good things. There's a
lot of causes out there, but some are more important than others.''
</P>
<P>
   Any conversation with Henley, of course, winds its way into the
Eagles, the iconic Rock and Roll Hall of Fame group whose 1976
collection ``Their Greatest Hits 1971-1975'' has been the
biggest-selling album in U.S. history. The group dissolved amid
much acrimony during the early '80s but came back together during
1994 for a successful reunion tour that spanned two years.
</P>
<P>
   It also started work on a new studio album last year, but Henley
says a combination of factors conspired to put the Eagles on the
backburner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really at a point in my album where I thought I could
divide my time and my attention and my creativity between my
project and that project, and I found I couldn't do it,'' Henley
says. ``My album had to take priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, frankly, I don't think (the Eagles' album) was going
very well. We were definitely headed down the track towards making
a very mediocre record, and I think we needed some distance from
it.''

 `LEXX' EXPLORES SCI-FI's LUSTIER SIDE  
 (Includes a color slide of a scene from ``Lexx.'')

 By CHRISTOPHER BLAND  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be published in Canada before June 11. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)   &HT;    It has understandably been called ``Star Trek's'' evil twin. In
the sci-fi series ``Lexx,'' there are no final frontiersmen
selflessly rescuing alien kittens from trees. Along the darkly
humorous edge of ``Lexx,'' lust exudes and life is cheap. Against
the greater fabric of television, ``Lexx'' is certainly different.
 &HT;    Even against today's few offerings of relatively exotic sci-fi,
``Lexx'' is a siren of distinction for its black comedy, skewed
take on the human condition and open sexuality _ qualities that act
as counterpoints to contemporary sci-fi sensibilities, according to
Lex Gigeroff, co-writer of the show, along with Jeffrey Hirschfield
(voice of the show's lust-struck robot, 790) and executive producer
Paul Donovan.
 &HT;    Perhaps some of its unique style comes from the fact that the
series is filmed in a remote area of Canada _ Halifax, Nova Scotia.
And the people behind the show are all dedicated to taking a
low-key, unassuming approach to the genre.
 &HT;    ``Science fiction has a tendency sometimes to be very pompous
about itself,'' Gigeroff says, speaking from his office at Salter
Street Films in Halifax, which co-produces ``Lexx'' with Germany's
TiMe Film und TV Produktion.
 &HT;    ``We're really dealing with weighty issues here,'' he adds,
``but there's all sorts of ways of doing that. You can do that in a
heavy-handed way, or in a bit more of an ironic or off-center way,
and I think that's the trick, trying to find the outside edge of
science fiction.''
 &HT;    Gigeroff realizes that ``Lexx'' is not the first show to walk
sci-fi's fringes. ``There were things like `The Prisoner,' which
was certainly dark at times,'' he says of the 1967 series starring
Patrick McGoohan, ``and also things like `Dark Star,' John
Carpenter's dark 1974 space comedy.''
 &HT;    ``Lexx'' debuted in 1996 as four made-for-TV movies called
``Lexx: The Dark Zone Stories'' (now called season one). The movies
came two years after Paul Donovan's 1994 movie ``Paint Cans,''
which featured Gigeroff and Canadian actor Michael McManus, who
plays ``Lexx's'' undead assassin, Kai.
 &HT;    Two years later, in '98, ``Lexx'' returned as a 13-part series,
then returned again this spring with 13 new segments. More than a
Canadian hit, ``Lexx'' is popular in the United States, Britain,
France and Germany. Yet fans exist even farther abroad. Linked to
``Lexx's'' Web site (www.Lexx.com) are a few sites in Russia.
 &HT;    On the simplest level, ``Lexx'' is the story of three space
outcasts _ Kai, Stanley Tweedle (Canadian actor Brian Downey) and
Xev (German actress Xenia Seeburg) _ wandering space in a
cybernetically enhanced insect spacecraft, the ``Lexx.'' Beyond the
familiar backdrop of space, ``it's a show that's not really
connected to Earth in any way,'' says Gigeroff. ``(Kai, Stanley and
Xev) are not colonists from Earth ... So it kind of gives you a lot
of freedom ... a really tremendous latitude to go for it.''
 &HT;    That latitude resulted in a change to this season's story
structure. Where season two was a series of stand-alone episodes,
this year is a narrative centered around an interplanetary war. The
reason is that ``Paul (Donovan) really liked the idea of being able
to take a bit more time with some stories,'' comments Gigeroff.
 &HT;    ``It's sometimes a challenge to create a wholly self-contained
little universe each week,'' he says. ``You can take a bit of time
with some characters, which is what we tried to do with Nigel,''
meaning Nigel Bennett, the Emmy Award-winning Canadian actor cast
as season three's recurring character, Prince.
 &HT;    Another change is Seeburg's costume. Introduced during season
two as a replacement for German actress Eva Haberman, who played
Xev's progenitor, Zev, in the ``Lexx'' movies, Seeburg first
appeared as a savvy, red-haired love slave. The change to Seeburg's
natural blond tresses resulted during production this season.
 &HT;    ``People would see me like I look in real life, even the people
that I worked with, and they would always go, `Oh, Xenia, it's so
good to see you without that horrible red wig,''' says Seeburg from
her home in Dusseldorf, Germany. ``So finally it was like an
all-around agreement,'' which became an on-camera change only after
Seeburg was sure that fans had accepted her as Haberman's
replacement.
 &HT;    A constant of the show has been its stunning digital effects,
created by Filmeffekte GmbH in Germany and CAGE Digital in Halifax.
Yet the effects, too, have evolved. This season was shot using High
Definition technology that was blended with digital imagery, then
treated on video with a film effect. Perhaps the only thing that
hasn't changed is the life-and-death situations in which the
cowardly captain, Stanley Tweedle, routinely finds himself.
 &HT;    ``We really think it's one of our missions in life to put Brian
Downey in as many uncomfortable shooting positions as possible,
just because he's such a great guy,'' Gigeroff says, jokingly.
``Paul and I will be talking about what we're doing, and Brian will
come by and ask, `What are you going to put me in next week?' And
(Brian) does it cheerfully.''
 &HT;    As appealing as ``Lexx'' is to fans, Gigeroff doesn't expect the
show to become universally appealing. ``We've always kind of wanted
to try and get a little cult show,'' he says. ``This is never going
to be a show which everybody is going to like. It was never meant
to be.''
 &HT;    Oddly, some of the stars who've appeared on ``Lexx'' stand as
cult icons in their own right. ``The Dark Zone'' tales themselves
include Malcolm McDowell (an ultraviolent `malchick' in ``A
Clockwork Orange''), Rutger Hauer (tragic antagonist Roy Batty in
``Blade Runner'') and Tim Curry (just a sweet transvestite in ``The
Rocky Horror Picture Show'').
 &HT;    Although ``Lexx'' has had some success, Gigeroff can't speculate
about the future, given the precarious nature of TV. For the
moment, he is content with what he describes as ``an incredible
rocket ride so far'' _ a phrase that perhaps best describes the
impact of the show. As Seeburg says in one of the show's trailers,
it's a ride for you to remember.

ELECTION-MONITORING TEAM'S HEAD LEAVES PERU ABRUPTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ Charging that he had been deceived by Peruvian
officials, the head of the Organization of American States'
observation team angrily left Peru on Friday, two days before the
presidential runoff election that he was supposed to monitor to
prevent voting fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions of the election do not provide a strong basis
of legitimacy,'' said the OAS chief, Eduardo Stein, who was the
senior foreign observer of an election process that had been
tainted with charges of dirty tricks and vote fraud. ``I feel
deceived and disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein's views will be crucial as the regional organization he
represents and the Clinton administration and the U.S. Congress
consider applying economic sanctions against the government of
President Alberto Fujimori. In a report released late Thursday,
after the government's announcement that it would not postpone
Sunday's runoff, Stein's team offered a stinging rebuke to Peru.
</P>
<P>
   ``The characteristics and circumstances of the election
process,'' the observation team said, ``are not following a process
by which the vote will reflect the authentic will of the people.''
The team then ordered its election observers to withdraw from the
provinces and leave Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's election to a third five-year term was effectively
assured when his opponent, Alejandro Toledo, dropped out of the
race last week, claiming that he was not ready to enter ``a butcher
shop'' of fraud in a fixed election.
</P>
<P>
   But Stein, with the full backing of the Clinton administration,
attempted to mediate a solution between Toledo and the government
in which the election could be postponed so that foreign observers
would have ample time to test computer software to make sure the
vote count would be transparent and clean.
</P>
<P>
   Stein, who is a former foreign minister of Guatemala, led the
international criticism of the April 9 first-round vote, saying
``Something sinister is happening here'' as ballots and tally
sheets disappeared for hours without explanation and votes were
counted in undisclosed locations.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori fell just short of winning an outright majority victory
in the first round, according to an official tabulation made over
three days as the United States and other countries pressed for a
runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the first round, Stein has been trying to persuade
the government to stop spending public funds in the Fujimori
campaign and to open television networks to coverage of the
opposition. He has had only limited success.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last couple of days, Stein had expressed new
optimism that an agreement could be worked out, with a new election
date to be set on June 4 or some weeks later. Negotiations had
reached the level where Fujimori was talking directly by telephone
with Cesar Gaviria, the head of the OAS and a former president of
Colombia, according to Peruvian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Stein said he had strong indications as late as midday Thursday
that the Peruvian government would postpone the election, and was
shocked by the news in the afternoon that the National Elections
Commission had voted 3-2 against a postponement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were led to believe that there was going to be a favorable
outcome,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was met with an increase in violent demonstrations
across Peru, including an attack with rocks and Molotov cocktails
on the presidential palace late Thursday. Student and labor groups
are planning demonstrations and strikes to protest the election.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a television interview Friday, Fujimori brushed aside Stein's
complaints. ``Globalization does not mean there can be unlimited
intervention in a country's internal affairs,'' he said. ``The
software problems have been resolved. There will be no fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein also had critical words for Toledo, who offered
inconsistent public positions on the conditions under which he
would re-enter the race. ``His hesitation, tardiness in providing a
clear-cut answer, exhausted the time,'' Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton responded Friday to the news from Peru,
saying, ``Free, fair and open elections are the foundation of a
democratic society. Without them, our relationship with Peru
inevitably will be affected.''

CHINA'S TOSHIBA LAPTOP USERS ANGRY THEY WEREN'T OFFERED SETTLEMENT
DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Toshiba Corp.'s settlement of a class-action
lawsuit in the United States last year has backfired in China,
where consumers are charging discrimination because the Japanese
electronics maker has not offered them the same deal.
</P>
<P>
   Toshiba, the world's largest supplier of laptop computers,
startled the industry last October by agreeing to pay American
consumers as much as $2.1 billion in compensation for laptops made
before November with a flawed computer chip that controls the
floppy disk drive. The settlement was meant to head off potentially
devastating damages from the class-action suit, which was brought
by two Texans.
</P>
<P>
   The company also offered a software patch to fix the problem for
Toshiba laptop owners worldwide, but that has not satisfied Chinese
consumers, who are ever ready to discern a slight from their
wartime aggressors. The Chinese want to be compensated, too, even
though no lawsuit has yet been brought in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel quite angry, they're being very unreasonable,'' said
Wang Jialiang, a Shanghai sales manager for Legend Holdings Ltd.,
Toshiba's only authorized distributor in China. Wang said he had
e-mailed friends to spread the word of what he called Toshiba's
misdeeds, and had even berated some Japanese. Toshiba is China's
leading laptop supplier, having sold 200,000 of the machines in the
country in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Resentment of Japan remains deep in China and commercial
disputes between the two countries can quickly flare into
nationalistic bickering. The Japanese are vilified on each
anniversary of the Imperial Army's rape and massacre of civilians
in Nanjing. And it is not uncommon for Chinese to tell Westerners
of their hatred for Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   But besides the nationalistic sentiments involved, Toshiba's
trouble in China reflects the legal naivete of Chinese consumers in
a country that is still developing the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   The problem began when Toshiba failed to fix an error in the
microcode of a chip designed by NEC Corp. In rare circumstances,
the flaw could cause users to lose data while saving it to a floppy
disk, although Toshiba says it has not heard of that happening on
any of the 15 million laptops it has sold worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the company decided it would be less costly and
better for public relations to settle the suit brought by the two
men in Texas rather than go through a costly, drawn-out legal fight
that it might lose.
</P>
<P>
   It was not long before word of the settlement was making its way
through Chinese Web sites and chat rooms and Chinese indignation
began to build. Earlier this month, China's state-run media picked
up the complaint with headlines like ``No compensation angers
Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, the company dispatched a vice president and other
executives to Beijing to try to repair the damage. But they got
little sympathy with their explanation that the flaw had not caused
any data loss that the company was aware of and that the American
settlement was a legal maneuver for that country only.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toshiba has tried to save the situation, but they're using
irresponsible methods,'' said a front-page article in China
Business Times on Tuesday. The China Consumer Journal dismissed the
executives' efforts, saying ``Toshiba's apology was not sincere.''
</P>
<P>
   Toshiba's China headquarters in Beijing declined to comment on
the matter other than to say through a spokesman that the company
was still discussing the matter. But China's government-sponsored
Consumers Association said Toshiba had violated China's consumer
law with its delay in notifying Chinese consumers of the problem.
The announcement and instructions for fixing the potential problem
were posted in English on the company's Web sites but not until the
controversy grew were they posted in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Several groups of Toshiba laptop owners in China are considering
a lawsuit against the company, according to the state media. Sales
of Toshiba laptops, meanwhile, have slumped. Wang of Legend said he
was not pushing the brand and on occasion had even inflated the
price to discourage people from buying the computers. ``I tell
people to buy IBM and HP,'' he said.

 &HT;    NEW CHOICES FACE MIDDLE EAST AFTER ISRAEL'S LEBANON WITHDRAWAL
 &HT;    (1000&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Eight centuries after crusader knights in
armor guarded its thick stone walls, the hilltop Beaufort castle of
southern Lebanon has fallen again.
</P>
<P>
   Beaufort was a mainstay of the Israeli army's two-decades
occupation in southern Lebanon until Wednesday. Now, a Hezbollah
flag flies there.
</P>
<P>
   As with every great turn of the Middle East, there will be new
peril and promise for its clerics, presidents and generals _ and
for the envoys there from the West.
</P>
<P>
   United Nations troops moved into the south Friday to help ensure
order. They also began checking maps to see if Israel's withdrawal
was complete.
</P>
<P>
   They say Lebanon will support their ruling, important because
Lebanon so far still claims ownership of an Israeli-held piece of
unpopulated land, the Chibaa Farms.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal was a campaign promise of Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak. But prompted by the collapse of the South Lebanon Army,
which Israel had paid to be its barrier against the hostile local
population, the planned withdrawal came more than a month ahead of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The international boundaries are not entirely clear and there is
no peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   While there is still some confusion about the details, the
withdrawal has clearly recast the region. Whether it brings peace,
however, depends on how the Middle East's leaders respond.
</P>
<P>
   Barak will have to show his people that air power can defend
them without their so-called ``security zone'' in Lebanon. But, he
will have to do so without the heavy-handed attacks in Lebanon that
have brought international condemnation in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah clerics will have to decide if they are done fighting
Israel and want to focus on their political activities.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian President Hafez Assad faces new decisions, too, in his
quest to get the Golan Heights back from Israel. Will he seek
leverage by continuing to encourage attacks against Israel by
Hezbollah or other militias in Lebanon? Or, will he see more
benefit in coming back to the negotiating table?
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials will be urging all sides to remain calm. They
want a peace deal before President Bill Clinton, apparently seen as
reliable by both Assad and Barak, leaves office in eight months.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate question is whether the border between Israel and
Lebanon will be peaceful. It is now lined daily with curious,
angry, and sometimes armed Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   They gawk at the Israeli towns and army patrols on the other
side of the fence. Those towns in the past have been frequent
targets for Hezbollah Katyusha rockets.
</P>
<P>
   For now, neither side wants to disturb the peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have some sort of balance of terror, a sort of cold
war between Israel and Syria,'' said American University of Beirut
political scientist Nizar Hamzeh. ``Israel definitely has more
power but Hezbollah has the Katyushas.''
</P>
<P>
   The key is Hezbollah's 39-year-old, charismatic leader Sayyed
Hassan Nasrallah.
</P>
<P>
   Nasrallah met with foreign journalists Thursday. It was in the
type of Spartan meeting room, with plastic chairs and peeling white
walls, that has enhanced the group's reputation as uncorrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Cordial and relaxed, Nasrallah basked in what he and others are
calling the first Arab victory over Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But, he was intentionally enigmatic about Hezbollah's next move.
</P>
<P>
   He said Hezbollah would keep attacking Israeli troops until
Israel vacated the disputed Chibaa Farms area and released war
prisoners. He said Hezbollah's victory should convince Palestinians
to drop their peace process with Israel and adopt armed resistance.
</P>
<P>
   But, he also said Hezbollah would not hurt civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any intention to attack civilians. But not all
Israelis are civilians,'' he said. ``Anything is possible, but in
regard to civilians we are extremely careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Israel and the SLA have killed far more Lebanese
civilians than Hezbollah has killed Israeli civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah might not want to risk Israeli reprisals that could
endanger its victory or anger Lebanese. Nasrallah is not just
concerned with rockets. He's also counting votes and Hezbollah's
popularity is soaring.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its guerrilla force, it runs hospitals and
schools and has seven members in the Lebanese parliament.
</P>
<P>
   With its ``liberation'' of south Lebanon, it surely won votes
for parliamentary elections in August. It had already moved three
mobile medical clinics into the south by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say that the platform for the parliament is
beginning today,'' Hamzeh, the political analyst, said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Barak is also basking in victory. A Gallup poll of
Israelis conducted Wednesday showed 75 percent supporting the
withdrawal, and Barak with a 54 percent approval rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``He promised and delivered, and it wasn't only an election
slogan,'' wrote columnist Hemi Shalev in the Ma'ariv daily. ``But,
one cannot take away from Barak the fateful moment when he assumed
responsibility and made a decision. The end result may not yet have
been tested, but he has already passed the test of courage.''
</P>
<P>
   On trips throughout nervous northern Israel following the
withdrawal, Barak tried to explain how he would keep Israel safe
despite the Hezbollah troops at the border fence.
</P>
<P>
   Now, air power, without ground troops, compose the deterrence
against attacks. The strikes could be against Hezbollah or its
Syrian backers in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``No target and no element of power in Lebanon will be immune to
a painful reprisal. Without our presence on Lebanese soil, there is
no restriction to a harsh reaction to aggression,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   While threatening Syria, Barak still hopes for the peace deal
with President Assad that is needed to truly bring peace to
Israel's northern border. Israel has given vague offers to give up
the strategic Golan Heights. Syria rejected the deal, saying it had
not been assured the Golan withdrawal would be complete.
</P>
<P>
   Assad could still use Hezbollah to exert pressure on Israel.
Nasrallah said that Hezbollah owes Syria help in winning the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   But, given Barak's warnings of reprisals and the lack of Israeli
targets in his backyard of Lebanon, Assad may opt to get what he
can through negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials, who have tried hard to woo Assad back to the
negotiating table, have made it clear that they will blame Assad
for violence in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   One player in the arena, at least, is finished. The South
Lebanon Army has dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 SLA fighters have turned themselves over to Lebanese
officials, who will try them as traitors. About 6,000 SLA fighters
and their families were refugees in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   SLA commander, Gen. Antoine Lahad reportedly told an Israeli
newspaper that he felt ``conned'' by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is over, as far as I'm concerned. Don't call me
'general' any more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials later said that Lahad denied making those
comments, but by then he was headed to his home and family in
France.

FOR SLEUTHERS, TRACKING IS AN ADVENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``On the river ice, most of the snow had been taken by the wind,
and the pugmarks were crisp, as if incised in steel. In one place,
the tigress had lain down and stretched, leaving behind a ghostly
outline even to the big head and long tail, the leg crook, the big
floppy paws. All that was missing was the stripes.''
</P>
<P>
   The tracks animals leave behind tell a story _ not always this
exotic, but always evocative. The great nature writer Peter
Matthiessen wrote those lines in his book ``Tigers in the Snow,''
and naturalists around here say a simple walk in the woods or even
your own backyard will provide you with volumes of information, if
you know how to read them.
</P>
<P>
   Wild animals are by nature elusive, but they leave signs of
their lives everywhere _ in tracks, broken twigs, gnawed or clipped
branches, excavated dirt, and especially their droppings.
</P>
<P>
   Sleuthing through these signals is an ancient art and a modern
science. It is an endeavor that can ground us in the natural world.
But you can't just bone up on it in a book. You need to get outside
and immerse yourself in what the ``Peterson Field Guides: Animal
Tracks'' calls ``the little stories from wild country.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a perfect description. After all, before language evolved,
what did we read? Paleontologist Martin Lockley, author of ``The
Eternal Trail: A Tracker Looks at Evolution,'' says it was tracks,
of course. Even today, children of the Bushmen of the Kalahari can
distinguish their mother's footprints in the sand from all others.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, the art hasn't been lost either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier than birdwatching,'' says Dr. Greg Mertz, director
of the New England Wildlife Center in Hingham, Mass. ``Once you've
found a track, it won't fly away on you.''
</P>
<P>
   On city sidewalks, all summer, you'll see the sticky trails of
slugs as they crisscross the pavement. In your front lawn, divots
of overturned grass mean that skunks have been grub hunting. In
wooded areas in the suburbs around Boston, you're likely to see the
whitish pellets or casts of owls littered around certain trees.
These pellets are worlds unto themselves. They are regurgitated,
undigested parts of the owl's prey. Breaking them apart, you can
find bits of mouse skulls, and ribs, and long bones. You could
almost rebuild a mouse skeleton from what you find in a single
cast.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   For us beginners, it's easiest to find clear footprints of
animals in mud after a rainshower, or in the moist earth along
ponds and rivers, or in snow.
</P>
<P>
   Here we can see the distinctive tracks of rabbits _ the small
front feet close together and the longer, larger hind prints
farther apart. We can imagine the hop it takes to make them. There
are the handlike prints of the opossum and raccoon, the flat, round
prints of porcupines, and the elegant, almost pear-shaped hoof
marks of whitetail deer.
</P>
<P>
   But experienced trackers can see so much more. They notice the
outline of footprints in leaf litter, gravel, even hard rock. And
furthermore, they can read between the lines.
</P>
<P>
   Master tracker Tom Brown Jr. was at the Museum of Science in
Boston this week as part of the opening of the new ``Natural
Mysteries'' exhibit, which can give your tracking career a
headstart. With many animal tracks, Brown says, he knows ``who made
them, whether it was male or female, dominant left or right, was
its belly full or empty.''
</P>
<P>
   If you don't believe him, Brown, who teaches seminars in New
Jersey on tracking and has written several books on the subject,
recommends a simple experiment. Walk down a beach or any area that
will hold a good track mark. Stroll along for a few feet. Then
drink a couple of glasses of water and make a new set of tracks
right next to the old one. ``You'll see the difference yourself,''
Brown says. The inside edge of the footprint ``will be pressed in
deeper if you have food or water in your belly.''
</P>
<P>
   Just that morning, Brown says, he spotted loads of raccoon
tracks in empty lots on his way from his hotel to the museum. It's
easy, he says, ``if you know the little secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   A few of those secrets are outlined in the museum's new exhibit.
In one diorama of rabbits, we learn: ``If the snipped twigs look
like they were cut with pruning shears close to the ground, they
were eaten by rabbits and hares. If the . . .nipped twig is higher
from the ground and looks fibrous and torn, deer have been browsing
here. Old cuts are black while fresh ones are tan in color.''
</P>
<P>
   To uncover traces of chipmunks, ``look for piles of shelled
seeds and pine cone bits. Squirrels leave larger middens of food
remains.''
</P>
<P>
   At night, if you aim a flashlight into the woods and eyes are
looking back at you, you'll know they belong to a fox if they shine
a green/white. If they reflect yellow/green, it's a raccoon; white,
it's a spider; and gold, an American toad.
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing to do, according to Brown, is get your
knees dirty. The only way to learn about tracking is to go outside
and get up close to the actual tracks. It takes time to find them,
follow them, and puzzle through what they mean.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for mouse footprints in mud or breaking apart skunk
droppings may sound as earthy as you can get. But tracking is a
journey that all the experts talk about in a mystical way.
</P>
<P>
   Brown learned about nature from his friend's grandfather, an
Apache named Stalking Wolf. And paleontologist Lockley points out
the power we still invest in prints. Consider how many fans,
Lockley says in ``The Eternal Trail,'' travel great distances to
slip their feet into the prints their favorite stars have left on
that famous Hollywood sidewalk. It makes them feel connected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Footprints have great meaning,'' Lockley writes. ``Each is the
energetic signature of the species and consciousness that made
it.''

   Investors in stocks have endured a lot of pain since the markets
peaked a few months back. With the Dow Jones industrial average
down 10 percent for the year, and the Nasdaq composite down more
than twice that, investors are probably wondering when all this
agony will be over.
</P>
<P>
   Not just yet, according to L. Keith Mullins, head of emerging
growth research at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Mullins believes the bloodletting in stocks will not be stanched
until investor fervor for initial public offerings goes completely
cold.
</P>
<P>
   The number of new stock offerings has dropped considerably in
recent weeks _ only 23 companies have offered shares to the public
in May, down from 65 in March, according to Richard Peterson, chief
market strategist at Thomson Financial Securities Data.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse for investors, 61 percent of this year's new issues
are trading below their offering prices. ``It's ugly out there,''
Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Not ugly enough, according to Mullins. As long as there is any
life in the market for new company shares, he thinks stocks as a
whole remain vulnerable. Last Thursday's offering of Sonus Networks
shares indicates the IPO market still has a pulse. Sonus offered 5
million shares to the public at $23 each, and the stock closed its
first day of trading at $50.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``An enormous amount of damage has been done to investor
psyches,'' Mullins said. ``But the new-issue market continues to be
fairly resilient. My expectation is we will see the market continue
to be much more selective about what issues will be brought out.
The window will shut completely before the correction is done.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullins bases this view on 20 years of initial public offering
data. New stock issues, he has found, are a perfect measurement of
investor sentiment. ``It's when investors know the least about the
companies and the information has been structured to have maximum
appeal,'' he explained. ``When investors are wildly bullish, you
can put anything through the channel. When they are bearish, if you
had a company turning dirt to gold, people would say gold is going
down.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason Mullins thinks we still have a way to go in the
correction is that prices of new issues on their first day out are
still popping like champagne corks.
</P>
<P>
   During April and most of May, Mullins said, first-day gains in
IPO's averaged 13 percent. While that is well below the 109 percent
average pop seen last December, it is still above the average for
1994 through 1998, when the figure was 12.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And while the number of deals has declined in recent weeks, it
has not fallen enough for Mullins. Around the 1987 crash, for
example, the average number of deals each month fell from 63 to 9.
And during the Long Term Capital Management crisis in the fall of
1998, the number of deals fell from 53 monthly to 15. So the 23
stocks issued so far in May looks a bit high.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one piece of Mullins' data may indicate we are close to
the correction's end. That is the difference between a new stock's
offering price and the middle of the price range company management
expected when they presented their deal to investors.
</P>
<P>
   When investors are euphoric for new issues, the stocks typically
fetch prices well above the expected range. Last January, for
instance, the average IPO's price was an astonishing 45 percent
above the middle of the expected range. By comparison, between 1994
and 1998, the average IPO came out at a price 0.1 percent below the
middle of the expected range.
</P>
<P>
   This month, however, IPO's have been pricing at 30 percent below
the midpoint. Mullins said this was the lowest monthly average he
has seen in six years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the IPO market has further to cool before Mullins will be
convinced that the correction in stock prices is over. When
investor appetite for new issues disappears altogether, he said, be
on the alert for a ripping rally in small and mid-cap stocks.

 FUNDS ARE RELEASED FOR U.N. PEACEKEEPING IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM WEINER

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., has released his hold on
$40 million in State Department funds appropriated for a U.N.
peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, his spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's spokesman, Ed Amorosi, said Gregg decided to lift
his hold after the Senate defeated a measure to set a deadline for
withdrawing U.S. ground troops from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But Gregg continues to use his power as chairman of a Senate
appropriations subcommittee to block the transfer of $328 million
in peacekeeping funds for U.N. missions in East Timor, Sierra Leone
and Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg met on Wednesday with Richard C. Holbrooke, U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, to discuss his objections to the
release of the money. They reached no agreement, Amorosi said.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech on the Senate floor, Gregg explained that he was
blocking the peacekeeping money because of his strong objections to
a peace accord signed between the combatants in Sierra Leone, which
gave amnesty and a share of power to rebels who have murdered and
mutilated thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   Backing a peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone, Gregg said, was
tantamount to ``endorsing a policy that brought into power people
who had committed rape, murder and atrocities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The policy being pursued in Sierra Leone was misdirected from
the start,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not have been making peace,'' he added. ``We should
have been taking a harder line.''

   HONGKONG-ECON (Hong Kong) _ Less than three years after a plunge
in the value of Thailand's currency triggered an economic crisis
across much of Asia, the region is riding a wave of growth
reminiscent of the Asian miracle of the 1980s. The latest evidence
of the resurgence came Friday with a report that Hong Kong's
economic output rose 14.3 percent in the first three months of the
year. It was the territory's fastest quarter of growth since 1987.
Other Asian economies are growing at rates much faster than even
the most optimistic forecasters had predicted _ powered, to a large
extent, by a booming demand for its exports to the hot economy in
the United States. By Mark Landler.

   SCI-DIABETES (Undated) _ In an important advance against
diabetes, researchers in Canada are reporting that transplants of
insulin-producing cells have enabled eight patients with a severe
form of the disease to stop taking insulin injections. Two to 14
months after being transplanted in a simple procedure resembling a
tranfusion, the cells are still working in all eight patients, half
of whom were treated almost a year ago at the University of
Alberta. The patients, who had Type 1 diabetes, in which the body
produces little or no insulin of its own, no longer have any
symptoms of the disease. Although they no longer need insulin to
control their blood sugar, they now must take other drugs to
prevent rejection of the transplants. By Denise Grady.

   AUTO-INSURNACE (Undated) _ After falling for two years, car
insurance premiums around the country are climbing once again,
resuming a steady quarter-century rise. Several big insurers _
including Progresssive, Geico, State Farm and Allstate _ have begun
putting higher prices into effect, and analysts say that by the end

   RUSSIA-BUTTER (Vologda, Russia) _ As any gourmand around here
will tell you, there are but two types of butter in Russia. There
is ordinary, bland butter, bought by ordinary, bland people and
consumed on ordinary, bland occasions. And there is Vologda Butter.
Vologodskoye Maslo: The name fairly trips off the tongue _ the
Russian tongue, anyway. This is butter so cultured that it was
originally called Parisian butter, even though it is made in
Vologda oblast, a vaguely Massachusetts-shaped, almost New
York-sized province 250 miles northeast of Moscow. This is
expensive butter. This is also profitable butter. This is why some
scruple-deprived people are making counterfeit Vologda Butter, and
pawning it off on hapless Russians as the Real Thing. And this is
why Vladimir Mizgirev is angry. By Michael Wines.

&HT;     OUSTED TEXAS CONGRESSMAN LOBBIES FOR PRESIDENTIAL PARDON 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MATT FLORES  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ It has been eight years since Albert Bustamante
strolled the chambers of Capitol Hill, glad-handing with fellow
members of the House of Representative.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, Bustamante, in his second year out of prison
after serving 32 months for federal racketeering and bribery
convictions, was back on the House floor shaking hands, this time
trying to drum up support from his former colleagues in an effort
to secure a presidential pardon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll go to my grave saying I never committed a crime,''
Bustamante said. ``All my life, from the time I was a schoolboy
fighting segregation, I've fought for my civil rights. How can I
not fight this?''
</P>
<P>
   But the 65-year-old's appearance on the House floor was met with
a tepid response, even among some fellow Democrats, and it was a
far cry from the spirited receptions he routinely encounters when
visiting former constituents at gatherings on San Antonio's South
and West sides.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bustamante said he was greeted warmly by some House
members, others criticized the former four-term congressman,
suggesting his visit _ and his quest for signatures on a resolution
for the pardon _ was a self-serving lobbying effort and represented
at the very least a breach of decorum.
</P>
<P>
   Still others said Bustamante's action may have violated
congressional rules that allow former members to be heard on the
House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this disgraced former member of Congress is doing is flat
out wrong, and his former colleagues ought to put an end to his
improper entreaties,'' said Charles Lewis, executive director of
the Center for Public Integrity, a Washington-based nonprofit,
nonpartisan organization that concentrates on ethics and
public-service issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante balked at the notion, saying once a member of
Congress, always a member.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments aside, Bustamante's trip to Washington represented
perhaps his best shot at clearing his name. Observers say his
chances of winning a pardon under President Clinton, albeit slim,
are better than they would be if a Republican were in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   As of October, Clinton had granted 161 presidential pardons over
his two terms. But that represented only 2.5 percent of the
applications his office had received seeking pardons. Using that
rate as a barometer, Clinton has been less prone to granting
clemency applications than his predecessors going back to Gerald
Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Largely ceremonial, presidential pardons effectively clear a
felon's record after time is served. The right to vote, run for
office, carry firearms and certain licensing privileges _ otherwise
lost upon federal conviction _ also are restored, officials with
the Justice Department and U.S. attorney's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has declined to name them, Bustamante said he picked
up signatures from 16 former colleagues. He plans to use those and
others he might obtain in a petition he will forward to the
president's staff in the next three or four weeks. The signatures
aren't required for the pardon, but Bustamante believes they could
help his cause.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it could be years before Bustamante's request may be
reviewed. The Justice Department, which weighs pardon requests,
historically has considered such petitions five years after an
inmate's release from prison.
</P>
<P>
   The effort represents an about-face for the former congressman,
who previously had said he wouldn't accept a pardon if it were
offered.
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante's political career began to unravel before he was
indicted. When word leaked of the federal probe into his business
dealings, the adverse publicity severely damaged his bid for a
fifth congressional term. Bustamante was defeated in 1992 by Henry
Bonilla, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted in 1993 of accepting a $35,000 bribe to help a food
services company win a new contract from Lackland Air Force Base
and for illegally receiving a $20,000 loan underwritten by his
partners in a business deal that could have netted him hundreds of
thousands of dollars more and the promise of future loans,
Bustamante steadfastly has maintained his innocence.``There are a
lot of people out there who come up to me and say, `You were
screwed,''' Bustamante said.
</P>
<P>
   He also maintains other House members have engaged in conduct
far more egregious without being charged with any crime.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Bustamante may have trouble currying favor even with
Democrats in his home state.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles A. Gonzalez, a freshman House member and the son of
longtime Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, for whom Bustamante once worked as
an aide, said he would be reluctant to support a resolution for a
presidential pardon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically undoing something that another branch of
government has done, and, if you trust the system, the judge should
have known more about the case than the president or anyone else,''
Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Bustamante lives in The Dominion, a posh development in
San Antonio. He manages a strip center on the South Side and still
fields calls from former constituents who need help with their
personal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albert has had a long public service career, and regardless of
what transpired, the bottom line is he was always available to the
people, and that's what they appreciated about him,'' said Walter
Martinez, a former city councilman who, with Bustamante at his
side, ran unsuccessfully for county commissioner earlier this year.

 &HT;    TEXAS DEATH ROW INMATE DESERVES NEW TRIAL, PROTESTERS SAY
 &HT;    By MIRIAM A. GARCIA
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill., and former boxer
Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter said Friday a Texas inmate due to be
executed next month deserves a new chance to prove his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nationally, our criminal justice system has been fraught with
errors, and there is a strong risk that innocent persons may be
condemned to die,'' Jackson said at a Capitol Hill news conference.
``I appeal to Governor George W. Bush and the Texas Board of
Pardons to grant Gary Graham clemency.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham is ``a man who has clear evidence of his innocence, has
not had a hearing yet, and is scheduled to die,'' said Carter. ``We
cannot ask for a perfect punishment coming form an imperfect
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who spent 19 years in prison on a murder conviction
before he was proved innocent, was the subject of the film ``The
Hurricane,'' starring Denzel Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, 36, is to be executed June 22 for the murder of a man in
1981. He was identified by a witness at his trial as the killer,
and courts have reviewed his case 35 times.
</P>
<P>
   However, his attorney, Richard Burr, said he found witnesses and
evidence that could absolve Graham. Burr said the bullet that
killed the man could not have been shot by the .22-caliber gun
belonging to Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried endlessly to get courts to hear this evidence,''
Burr said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Graham's latest appeal
in April.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson introduced a bill in April calling for a seven-year
national moratorium on all executions until death row inmates have
an opportunity to restate their cases. Noting cases in which
innocent people have been convicted of capital crimes, Jackson said
the bill would save the lives of Graham and ``other innocent
persons'' sitting on death row.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking for immediate consideration of the moratorium.
That does not mean to free everybody on death row. It does not mean
let everybody get out of jail. But it certainly means no execution
should occur until everyone on death row has an opportunity to
present their case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson appealed to President Clinton and Attorney General Janet
Reno to instruct the Justice Department to send the Supreme Court a
``friend of the court'' brief on behalf of Graham.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bush should not allow the possibility of executing an
innocent person.
</P>
<P>
   Bush can grant a 30-day delay in an execution if a majority of
the Texas Board of Pardons recommends it.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor can not commute a sentence if the board does
not recommend it, said Mike Jones, a spokesman for the governor's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Jones noted that Graham received a commutation from Gov. Ann
Richards in 1993, but added that it does not bar him from
requesting another.

<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ Jeff Colborn plunged into fusion energy
research in the late 1980s, first at the Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory and then at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, filled with idealism about fusion's potential for
revolutionizing nuclear power generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted the toughest challenge,'' said Colborn, recalling the
goals he had after studying engineering and physics at the
University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   But the entrepreneurial Colborn, who founded a business during
high school selling decals for the motorcycles he and his friends
raced, fretted that it could take 50 years before anyone could
build a business on fusion. No wonder he is more at home these days
as founder and chief executive of Metallic Power Inc., a
little-known entrant in the intense race to design and manufacture
fuel cells, low-pollution devices that generate electrical current
from chemical reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Although they are similar in many ways to batteries, fuel cells
can be quickly regenerated by pumping in new chemical fuel. And
unlike fusion, they are teetering on the edge of becoming big
business. Several hundred units have been sold already, and some
analysts predict a billion-dollar market by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The last steps are not coming easily, though. No one is making
money yet, and the technology is not ready for potential home-run
markets, like power for vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel cell companies' slow path highlights the difficulties
of innovating for the nuts-and-bolts dimension of the economy.
Though this is not the fusion world it is also not the Internet
world, where new services can be up and running within weeks and
barriers to entry are low.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have gotten used to the pace of change of information
technology,'' said Vincent R. Shiely, a vice president who oversees
new ventures _ including a research partnership with Metallic Power
_ at Briggs &AMP; Stratton Corp., the largest manufacturer of
nonautomotive gasoline engines. ``But this is pushing the frontier
of materials, and there are still basic technology and reliability
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuel cell companies are developing everything from replacements
for tiny batteries like those used in cell phones and hearing aids
to highly efficient power plants big enough to fit the needs of
electric utility companies.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is to come up with answers to conflicting demands
for, among other things, lightness, reliability, durability and low
cost.
</P>
<P>
   Metallic Power has been slowed down by annoyingly mundane
problems like making its early designs leak-proof. But there have
also been scarier roadblocks, as when Colborn and Stuart I.
Smedley, his chief technology officer, reached the painful
conclusion that a system they had adapted from other researchers
for converting wastes back into recyclable fuel was hopelessly
unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   Smedley, a former university professor from New Zealand,
eventually came up with a new design that was much simpler,
one-tenth the size, and, perhaps best of all, something that
Metallic Power's lawyer believes is patentable. But it took many
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Multiplying the ideal time for each stage by two has turned
out to be a pretty accurate predictor of what actually happens,''
Colborn said. ``Our schedule has stretched.''
</P>
<P>
   Metallic Power was founded in 1995 but did not produce its
first, primitive prototype until late 1997. The company faces steep
challenges. Not only is it a relative newcomer with far less
capital than many others; it is also using zinc as its fuel, a
radically different approach.
</P>
<P>
   Several venture capitalists unfamiliar with the energy business
got cold feet after looking closely at Colborn's plans. Among them
was a restaurant owner. ``I spent a lot of time driving to L.A. and
eating in his restaurant,'' Colborn said, but the prospect dropped
out when it came time to sign a check. ``Everybody thinks fuel
cells are cool, but when they get into it they discover they know
nothing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Colborn got a better reception from energy-focused investors
like Robert W. Shaw Jr., president of Arete Corp., an investment
firm based in Center Harbor, N.H., that manages money for
utilities. ``Every fuel cell company is struggling with similar
problems,'' said Shaw, whose firm's fuel cell investments include
$2 million of the $8.6 million Metallic Power has raised in two
rounds of financing. ``At the end of the day, this company is going
to make something, and it could have a long-term, sustainable
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The payoff for fuel cell innovators could be breathtaking,
especially if someone can create products that meet the performance
needs of the auto industry. ``As soon as someone has a system that
operates in all environments at the cost of combustion engines,
which is about $50 per kilowatt, it will take over the world,''
said Patrick Grimes, an energy consultant in Scotch Plains, N.J.
``Some cell system will get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Colborn's company is focusing first on market niches that can
afford far higher prices per kilowatt and are more likely to
generate near-term profits, starting with portable generators for
homes and small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   History supports a cautious approach. Fuels cells were described
in concept as far back as 1839, but when it came to designing
products, other power sources _ from batteries to internal
combustion engines to steam turbines _ always seemed to have a
better cost-benefit mix.
</P>
<P>
   So far, fuel cells' only big success has been on space missions,
where cells have been used for more than 30 years and cost has been
a negligible concern. But there has been renewed interest in recent
years, spurred by new electronic controls, better understanding of
which chemicals would make the best fuel cells and, perhaps most
important, government research grants and stricter environmental
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the interest has been focused on hydrogen-based
designs. Most hydrogen cells extract hydrogen from hydrocarbons
like gasoline, natural gas or methane. The purified hydrogen reacts
with oxygen drawn from the air to create electricity and water
vapor.
</P>
<P>
   Metallic Power, however, is working instead with zinc, which
produces electricity and zinc oxide, a harmless powder used in
cosmetics, when suspended in an alkaline liquid and then exposed to
oxygen. Zinc/air cells, as they are called, are in theory simpler
and cheaper than their hydrogen counterparts, according to Colborn.
Others companies experimenting with zinc/air fuel cells include
zinc/air battery makers like EVonyx Inc., a subsidiary of Reveo
Inc., in Elmsford, N.Y., and Electric Fuel Ltd. of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Zinc's biggest disadvantage is that nothing can match the
infrastructure already in place for distributing hydrogen.
Automotive fuel cells based on hydrogen, for example, could be
refueled by today's gas stations with relatively modest changes.
</P>
<P>
   Hydrogen-based fuel cells are the only commercially available
products, and numerous new variants are well down the development
path.
</P>
<P>
   The company most in the Wall Street spotlight is Ballard Power
Systems Inc., a publicly traded Canadian company that is 25 percent
owned by DaimlerChrysler. In recent months, Ballard has shipped a
stationary, 250-kilowatt fuel cell generator to European utilities
for testing; introduced an improved, compact version of its first
automotive cell, which Ford Motor is testing; and announced a
partnership with Sunbeam Corp.'s Coleman Powermate unit, a big
distributor of portable electric generators, to develop a
co-branded fuel cell.
</P>
<P>
   A newer entrant, Plug Power Inc. of Latham, N.Y., is developing
refrigerator-sized cells that run on natural gas or propane for use
as home power sources. Plug Power went public in October at $15 a
share and soared to a high of $149.75 on March 10. But investors
fled after a dose of reality about the pace of development: The
company passed a deadline without meeting design requirements of
the General Electric Co., a joint venture partner, which was to buy
485 cells. Shares ended Friday at $39.4375.
</P>
<P>
   Multinational companies have largely been participating as
investors and partners but some multinationals are more directly
involved. United Technologies Corp. owns International Fuel Cells
of South Windsor, Conn., the developer of the fuel cells used on
space missions and a stationary power system that has been
installed in more than 200 commercial and institutional sites. And
Siemens of Germany, with support from the Department of Energy, is
field-testing a high-temperature hydrogen cell that could operate
in tandem with gas turbines at power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Metallic Power, by contrast, is not scheduled to deliver its
first testing prototypes to partners like Briggs &AMP; Stratton and
potential customers like the Army by the end of the year. Its more
immediate goal is to complete a demonstration unit by July that
will show how a portable cell for backup power can be kept running
when fuel runs out simply by popping a new fuel cartridge in place.
The target audience is venture capitalists; Metallic Power hopes to
raise an additional $10 million to $15 million by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent staff meeting, Colborn and three other senior
managers pored over a chart showing the breakdown of the fuel cell
into scores of components. They pondered where weight could be cut
by design changes. Weight was not a concern for the July goals, but
promises had been made to Briggs and others about the year-end
prototypes, and Colborn wanted assurances the July unit could be
finished without compromising delivery of the prototypes.
</P>
<P>
   Colborn is also juggling the demands of raising capital, nearly
doubling his work force to about 50 by the end of the year and
moving to larger quarters. He is determined to move methodically,
arguing that in the turbulent world of fuel cells, Metallic Power
is not as far behind the hydrogen companies as it looks if the
finish line is defined as profitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are ahead of us in what they've put in the field, but
they are too expensive,'' he said, predicting that Metallic Power
will be among the first to become profitable if it meets its goals
of commercial sales in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Colborn is quick to concede, though, that the hydrogen cell
designers are bringing down costs. ``Realistically,'' he said,
``the best thing that could happen for us is that they succeed _
but not a whole lot sooner than us.''

 &HT;    Drawing a conclusion: We all love `Peanuts'
 &HT;    By Frank C. Rizzo
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The comic strips in the nation's newspapers today were supposed
to be a surprise for one special man.
</P>
<P>
   At their convention last year in San Antonio, members of the
National Cartoonists Society hatched a loving prank. Charles M.
Schulz's ``Peanuts'' would mark its 50th anniversary in 2000, and
``Sparky'' himself would get a lifetime achievement award. What if,
on the morning of that convention, Schulz picked up the newspapers
to check out his friends' strips and discovered that every one of
them was a tribute to him and ``Peanuts''?
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we wanted to honor him for the 50th anniversary;
something extra-special,'' said cartoonist Patrick McDonnell, who
draws ``Mutts'' and who proposed the idea to the NCS board.
``Because he loved comic strips so much, if he saw the whole comic
section talking about `Peanuts,' I knew he'd get a kick out of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fate had other plans. Schulz fell ill in December, found out he
had cancer and retired. He died at his home in Santa Clara, Calif.,
the night before the last ``Peanuts'' was published, on Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Today in New York, the NCS convention is in full swing; tonight
the winners of the society's annual awards, the Reubens, will be
disclosed. And ``Sparky'' Schulz's widow, Jeannie, will accept the
Milton Caniff Lifetime Achievement Award on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz had hoped to be able to collect the award himself, but he
never learned of his friends' other tribute, said Atlanta
Constitution editorial cartoonist Mike Luckovich, who organized the
yearlong project. ``When people see these, they'll get a feeling of
how much Schulz meant to so many cartoonists,'' Luckovich said.
``He was a giant inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100 cartoonists participated in the project. More than 80
of the tribute strips are posted at www.snoopy.com. And eventually,
you'll be able to see the original drawings at the Charles M.
Schulz museum being built near his studio in Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles Schulz is the reason I became a cartoonist,''
McDonnell said. ``He inspired a whole generation. Everybody loved
him.''

AUTO INSURANCE PREMIUMS ARE ON THE RISE AGAIN

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After falling for two years, car insurance premiums around the
country are climbing once again, resuming a steady quarter-century
rise.
</P>
<P>
   Several big insurers _ including Progressive, Geico, State Farm
and Allstate _ have begun imposing higher prices, and analysts say
that most other leading companies are likely to follow suit by the
end of the year. The insurers said they were forced to act by
rising expenses for repairs and treatment of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend is clearly upward,'' said Thomas V. Cholnoky, who
follows auto insurance for Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   While the size of the increases has varied widely _ and some
companies are still cutting prices _ rises of at least 4 and 5
percent have not been uncommon. And a few companies have raised
prices in some states by more than 10 percent. Analysts and
industry executives say they expect more of the same next year.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In New York and Connecticut, the first signs of the shift are
appearing. But the situation is less clear in New Jersey, where
spending on car insurance _ averaging $1,150 a year, compared with
$700 nationally _ has been the highest in the country. Last year
the legislature took the unusual step of ordering a 15 percent cut
in prices.
</P>
<P>
   While expenses for insurers may well be rising in New Jersey, as
elsewhere, industry executives said it was difficult to predict
whether those costs would be offset by legislative changes aimed at
reducing fraud and litigation and, if not, to what extent political
leaders would permit price increases.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates say the increases may not be justified. J.
Robert Hunter, director of insurance at the Consumer Federation of
America, said that while some costs are rising, expenses for
insurers, overall, are still declining.
</P>
<P>
   Americans spent an estimated $126 billion last year on car
insurance, which is mandatory in all states. That was nearly four
times what they paid to insure their homes. There are many more
claims involving cars and passengers than for homes, though, and
liability claims in the hundreds of thousands of dollars are much
more common in car crashes than in incidents related to homes.
</P>
<P>
   Besides raising prices, insurers are reducing or eliminating
discounts and screening applicants more carefully so they can apply
the highest rates to the riskiest drivers and simply refuse to sell
to some. Several companies have also been hacking away at
administrative expenses, which in some cases has meant layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates say that to make sure they are getting the
best deal as prices are rising, people should review their bills
and check prices with several companies. But rather than basing
coverage decisions on price alone, the advocates advise people to
talk with friends and insurance regulators to learn how different
companies treat customers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Prices for auto insurance fell 3.2 percent last year and 2.8
percent the year before after rising steadily since 1973, said
Robert P. Hartwig, chief economist at the Insurance Information
Institute, an industry group in New York. Insurers said at the time
that they cut their prices to reflect falling costs for claims.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer and less serious accidents were occurring, partly because
of safety features like air bags and anti-lock brakes. There had
also been declines in drunken driving and auto theft, and signs
that aging baby boomers were becoming safer drivers. Hartwig said
body shop costs and medical expenses had leveled off.
</P>
<P>
   While many of those trends are continuing, Hartwig said, their
financial benefits are being eclipsed by a resurgence in costs for
repairs and treatment of injuries. He said repair costs are up
partly because many companies stopped using generic replacement
parts after State Farm was sued by consumers last fall and ordered
to pay $1.2 billion for not using original manufacturers' parts.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Stoddard, a top executive at Safeco, the nation's 15th
largest insurer, said that while the number of accidents was still
declining, ``the severity is up.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said: ``The new cars are smarter and more expensive
to repair. And people are more expensive to repair; we call that
medical inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said he had no doubt that the insurers' costs per
accident were going up. ``But,'' he said, ``the number of accidents
is falling faster than the increase in costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Safeco, which reported a nearly $40 million loss in its auto
insurance business in the first quarter, has increased rates in 20
states so far this year, from just under 1 percent in Colorado to
8.2 percent in Michigan. Last year it cut prices in 18 states.
</P>
<P>
   The two biggest companies _ State Farm and Allstate _ are still
cutting rates in more states than they are raising them, but they,
too, are showing the early signs of a shift. Last year, State Farm
cut rates in 48 states and increased prices in only one,
Massachusetts. So far this year, State Farm says it is cutting
rates in 15 states and increasing them in 10, including a 5.6
percent rise in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   State Farm is seeking a decrease of nearly 5 percent in
California, the state with the most drivers. But Cholnoky said that
an analysis of rates in California showed that State Farm's prices
had been among the highest in the state, 31 percent higher than
Allstate's and 55 percent higher than Progressive's.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, Allstate has raised prices in two states _
Louisiana and South Carolina; last year there were no increases.
While it trimmed rates in 10 states last year, cuts this year have
been put into effect in four states.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, where regulators have taken steps to ease costs for
insurers, just as they did in New Jersey, one of the largest
companies, Progressive, has raised rates 4.3 percent _ in contrast
to a decrease of 4.1 percent last year. Nineteen small companies
have put in place increases ranging from less than 1 percent to
18.6 percent; six other small companies cut prices. In Connecticut,
one of the largest insurers, Nationwide Mutual, increased prices by
4.9 percent and six other insurers have come in with smaller
increases. Five small insurers cut prices. Last year price
decreases outnumbered increases nearly 3 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   One small New Jersey company, GSA, has raised premiums 15
percent, and several others New Jersey insurers are also asking
regulators for even higher increases. But John Tiene, executive
director of the Insurance Council of New Jersey, said these
increases had been requested two years ago and did not reflect
current expenses. The increase for GSA, however, had the effect of
nullifying the 15 percent legislative rollback.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, Progressive and Geico have been leading a
price war and gaining market share at the expense of companies like
State Farm and Allstate, which have been either losing market share
or merely holding even as the number of drivers has been growing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, both Progressive and Geico, after suffering significant
losses in earnings, are shifting toward higher prices. Since last
year, for example, Progressive has increased prices by an average
of 7.4 percent in 41 states, according to Charles B. Gates, an
insurance analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. Progressive has
raised rates about 4 percent in Missouri and is asking for an
increase of 9.9 percent in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   As it announced an underwriting loss of $86 million in the first
quarter of this year, Geico said it expected to increase rates in
many states, but gave no details. Geico is a unit of Berkshire
Hathaway.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said the increase in prices by Progressive and Geico,
which have been the fastest-growing big insurers, were likely to be
taken as a sign by other insurers that it was safe to raise prices.
Previously, he said, the others may have feared that price
increases would drive customers to Progressive and Geico.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said they expected State Farm and Allstate to
raise prices more slowly than other big companies because over the
previous two years they had reduced their prices less than many
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said that in their zeal to capture market share,
Progressive and Geico might have cut prices too much for their own
good. ``Those companies might have to raise rates,'' he said. ``But
some companies may be taking advantage of this opportunity to raise
their rates. I'm saying, `Wait a minute. You don't need to raise
your rates. You should be continuing to lower them.'''

 &HT;    Archbishop Demetrios, head of the 1.5 million Greek Orthodox
Christians in America, visits Atlanta
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ask Sandy Papadopoulos, ``How's business,'' and he's
likely to say, ``Thank God, everything's well.''
</P>
<P>
   He means it. As a reminder of their faith, his parents devoted a
section of their popular Athens, Ga., Pizza restaurant in DeKalb
County's Druid Hills community to religious iconography.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we do is a reminder of our faith,'' said
Papadopoulos, 26, who runs the restaurant with his parents John and
Asiemoula. And, he said, ``Anything and everything we do revolves
around the Greek community.''
</P>
<P>
   The two come together at the Cathedral of the Annunciation,
Atlanta's largest Orthodox Christian church. The cathedral is also
the seat of Bishop Alexios, head of the Greek Orthodox Diocese of
Atlanta, which is composed of about 30,000 Greek Orthodox families
across the Southeastern states. The Papadopouloses, who moved to
Atlanta in 1973, are one of about 1,400 families who make up the
cathedral's growing congregation.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, the city's Greek Orthodox Christians are
strengthening their community ties by breaking ground on a new
family life and recreation center on the cathedral grounds. Besides
recreation and workout facilities, the new buildings will house the
cathedral's Greek language school and other cultural classes,
including Greek dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of growth in our cathedral, a lot of activity,''
said the Rev. Mike Kouremetis, dean of the cathedral. ``We've
noticed an influx in the community from conversion and people
moving into the area. Ever since the Iron Curtain fell and people
are traveling, we have people here from Georgia, Bulgaria, Russia.
It's becoming a pan-Orthodox cathedral. We're bursting at the
seams.''
</P>
<P>
   For longtime Atlanta Greek families, new converts to Orthodox
Christianity, and newly arrived immigrants, the church offers a
home base, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that our ministry is from the cradle to the grave,''
said Kouremetis. ``Looking at the Greek culture, the European
culture and how this country was established, one of the first
things people created was the church. They built their neighborhood
around the church. The church becomes the focal point, the
beacon.''
</P>
<P>
   The cathedral is not only a spiritual center, but a place for
cultural expression and education, he said. The family life center
will expand that role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to keep in touch with your roots,'' said Steve
Alexander, a third-generation Greek American who is president of
the cathedral's parish council. ``We're all Americans, but we still
pay homage to our homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   Presiding over the groundbreaking will be Archbishop Demetrios,
head of the 1.5 million Greek Orthodox Christians in America.
Demetrios, 71, was enthroned Sept. 18 after a tumultuous reign of
three years by his predecessor, Archbishop Spyridon.
</P>
<P>
   Critics accused Spyridon of mismanaging church funds, ignoring
reports of sexual misconduct at the church's seminary in
Massachusetts, and attempting to run the church autocratically.
After criticism escalated and some parishes began withholding
funds, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, head of the worldwide
Orthodox Church, removed Spyridon from office.
</P>
<P>
   At his installation, Demetrios called for better understanding
between generations, between clergy and laity, and between the U.S.
and the international church. The Atlanta visit is one of many to
cities across the country as Demetrios attempts to tend to the
flock and heal hurts of the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   The last visit of a Greek Orthodox archbishop to Atlanta
occurred a year ago when Spyridon installed Bishop Alexios.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unusual for an archbishop to visit
</P>
<P>
   any time,'' said Alexander. ``To have him come for a
groundbreaking is extraordinary. He's brought balance and a calming
influence to our faith. He's brought our national community back
together. Our archdiocese is united.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 95-year-old Atlanta cathedral, the building program
represents not only a way to increase the identity of Greek
Atlantans, but an opportunity to raise the awareness of Greek
Orthodox Christians among practitioners of other faiths and other
Christian denominations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're scattered out through other Christian communities in
Atlanta playing soccer, baseball and basketball,'' said Alexander.
``We hope we can now host those things here and extend our family
hospitality to the Greater Atlanta community.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Thundershowers will surround low pressure as it moves from the
central Mississippi Valley early Saturday to the eastern Ohio
Valley and northern Middle Atlantic states later Saturday and
Sunday. The low will travel along a boundary separating very warm
and rather humid weather over the Southeast from cooler air to the
north. Some of the thunderstorms in the Ohio and Tennessee valleys
late Saturday will bring damaging winds and large hail. There is a
threat of flooding, especially in the eastern Ohio Valley, where
recurrent thundershowers pass over the same areas.
</P>
<P>
   Stalled low pressure over eastern Canada will block the advance
of moisture, keeping mainly dry weather over New York and New
England on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hot weather will persist over the Southwest. The Northwest will
be drier with seasonable temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

<P>
   FOCUS: DELUGE
</P>
<P>
   When an inch of rain falls in 24 hours, it's a wet day. When an
inch of rain falls in 13 minutes, as it did in Nashville, Tenn.,
around midnight Wednesday, it's a deluge. Bursts of rain are most
common in summer when the vigorous air currents in thunderstorms
combine with moisture-laden air. Rainfall rates at the center of
thunderstorms are often more than 3 inches an hour; however, a
given spot typically stays in the heaviest rain for only a few
minutes. The greatest burst of rain ever recorded in the United
States occurred in Unionville, Md., on July 4, 1956, when 1.23
inches of rain fell in only one minute. &QL;

   ISRAEL-HISTORY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Israel is engaged in a
national debate over new histories of Zionism and changes in the
school curriculum. An assumption of much of the new historical
scholarship is that Israel shares the blame for the conflict with
its adversaries and should come to terms with them as moral and
cultural equals. The fight over history is in the background as
Israel stakes out a new strategy for confronting Syria and Lebanon,
its remaining Arab adversaries to the north. By Ethan Bronner.

   U.S.-EUROPE-REVIEW (Berlin) _ The Cold War has been over for a
decade, and the big questions _ Euromissiles, Soviet divisions,
global peace itself _ have disappeared from U.S. relations with
European capitals. Beyond the intermittent flaring of Balkan
crises, their place has largely been taken by genetically altered
food, banana trade, capital punishment and even child custody. In
general, how to live, what to eat and whether to accept the death
sentence seem to have become the stuff of trans-Atlantic tiffs. By
Roger Cohen.

   SCHORK-JOURNALISM-REVIEW (Berlin) _ Journalism, it is said,
provides a first draft of history. I write this sitting in Berlin,
dreaming of Bosnia, and thinking of Kurt Schork, the Reuters
correspondent whose dispatches from Sarajevo helped shape the
world's view of a war as morally indelible to my generation of
correspondents as Vietnam was to another. Schork, 53, was killed
Wednesday in an ambush in Sierra Leone. By Roger Cohen.

   ARMS-CONTROL-REVIEW (Undated) _ New frontiers in arms control:
For the first time in many years, arms control experts are
exploring new, potentially better ways to actually control them.
Top thinkers of the political left and right are declaring
traditional arms control all but dead and calling for deep cuts in
remaining arsenals, for building anti-missile defenses against
rogue states and for finally getting serious about stopping the
spread of missile technology and nuclear arms. It's thinking about
the unthinkable in a new way. By William Broad.

   MIDEAST-LEBANON-REVIEW (Undated) _ The question hanging over the
abrupt Israeli departure is whether, in the absence of any other
force, Hezbollah will bring quiet or if they will attempt to
transfer their war of attrition across the border. The unknown
answer will reverberate across a spectrum of Middle East issues,
but none more than the attempts by Israel and its neighbors to
erect some form of workable peace. By Neil Macfarquahar.

   SOUTH-CLOSURE-REVIEW (Atlanta) _ When prosecutors in Birmingham,
Ala., charged two former Ku Klux Klansmen with the 1963 bombing of
a black church, there was talk about closure. But what is closure?
Is it merely a psychological phenomenon or a political one or some
melding of the two? Can a judicial resolution really soothe the
agony endured by victims, families and other wounded parties? From
South Africa to Chile to Neshoba County, Miss., to cities that have
built Holocaust museums, the search for closure has become a
driving force in politics, law and even culture. By Kevin Sack.

   HYPERCONVENIENCE-FOODS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Everyone knows America

food, portable comfort cuisine and dashboard dining. By Constance

Dreamed of Africa'' have attempted to explore what happens when
people join hands and parachute into the wilderness of a shared

   JAZZ-SOLOS (Undated) _ The solo is certainly the primary symbol
of jazz to the outside world _ a rail-splitting statement made
within a rail-splitting music. In the history of jazz criticism,
solos have been taken as the highest mode of assertion. And most of
the great heroes of the music have been powerhouse soloists. By Ben
Ratliff. (With photo)

<P>
   PREMIERES-MUSIC (Undated) _ Premieres are unnatural births.
Humans, unlike Greek gods and new operas, enter the world helpless
and barely formed. An opening night, especially one preceded by
fanfare, speculation and promotion, has no chance at childhood and
adolescence. Often its midwives are inept and its expectant parents
unprepared. The new piece happens all at once and fully formed. It
relies on the wisdom and charity of audiences, critics and
performers faced suddenly with an odd phenomenon: the grown-up
infant. By Bernard Holland.

   ROME-ART (Rome) _ For years, the problem of how to be both
relevant and imaginative in the first summer of the new millennium
has tormented curators the world over. But nowhere has that problem
been solved as nimbly or as persuasively as in an exhibition in
Rome called ``L'Idea del Bello'' at the Palazzo delle Esposizione
on the Via Nazionale, on view through June 26. (The title can be
translated as ``The Idea of Beauty'' or ``Beauty as an Idea.'') By
John Russell.

   LEBANON-ISRAEL _ BEIRUT, Lebanon _ With two decades of Israeli
occupation in southern Lebanon ended, the boundaries of the
oft-turbulent Middle East has changed. But is it for the better?
Members of the South Lebanon Army, accused of brutality by human
rights groups and financially backed by Israel, now find themselves
unarmed and at the mercy of their own countrymen. Hezbollah, the
``Party of God'' that has raged a terrorist campaign to repel the
Israeli occupation, is emboldened by victory. And Israeli citizens,
too many of whom never backed the occupation in the first place,
now worry that their Lebanese neighbors might seek retaliation.

Trying to get daughters, Fagan. Fagan has already completed the

probation. He's moved to a less conspicuous house and apparently
has kept a lower profile around Palm Beach. While his criminal
troubles are behind him, a civil suit between his wife and her son

real estate money that has helped him maintain his lifestyle.

`THE MAKING OF AMERICAN AUDIENCES': BOOK CHRONICLES AUDIENCE
EVOLUTION
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is the difference between a performance of ``The Marriage
of Figaro'' and a telecast of ``The Sopranos''? Or between a
Britney Spears concert and ``The Jack Benny Show? Or between a
gamelan performance and a pornographic Web site?
</P>
<P>
   The audience.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least that is one way to look at it. It is so difficult to
evaluate arts, compare their virtues and weigh their achievements,
and the entire debate over what was once called high culture is so
politically charged that it is tempting simply to say that
different entertainments attract different audiences. No aesthetic
distinctions are needed. Mozart and Spears do not have different
statures, just different devotees. There is no high, no low, only
differing cultural attitudes toward what is high and what is low.
</P>
<P>
   One problem, though, is that if the audience is the measure of
all things, then art becomes a reflection of sociology and
dissecting audience tastes becomes the art. This approach lies
behind market research, movie previews, television programming and
most book publishing. Before anything is packaged, the producers of
cultural commerce ask: Who is the audience? How can it be reached?
What are the ages, incomes, professions, tastes and attitudes we
desire?
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, academic analysis of culture often does something
similar. Strip away the superstructure of cosmetics and form, and
the artwork's true meaning can be found in demographics. Who is
being addressed and why? What is being sold? The main difference is
that here the categories are political, not commercial. Now they
tend to focus on gender, race and class. Culture becomes a series
of coded messages in which genders, races and classes negotiate for
power.
</P>
<P>
   Rich insights can be gained by such market analysis, of course,
but the risk is that the art itself may become inconsequential.
This is one of the flaws of ``The Making of American Audiences,'' a
survey spanning 240 years of drama, minstrelsy, vaudeville, film,
radio and television. Richard Butsch, a professor of sociology at
Rider University in New Jersey, has combed archives and newspapers,
historical documents and recent histories, studies of television
advertising and circus audiences, penny arcades and fan mail; his
bibliography alone takes up 36 pages. The subject is fascinating
and so are some of Butsch's ideas, but as the content of art is
eclipsed by considerations of audience politics, culture ends up
seeming like little more than a reflection of political tastes.
</P>
<P>
   But what a transformation of tastes is chronicled. Beginning in
the 18th century and through the first half of the 19th century,
Butsch suggests, there was a tradition of ``audience sovereignty''
in the theater. Upper-class patrons might sit onstage and publicly
chat with the actors. In the 1830s Tocqueville found that Americans
``paid not the slightest attention to the stage but walked about,
drank together and argued as if nothing else were going on.''
``Prostitution,'' Butsch points out, ``was important to the
profitability of theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   Such manners seemed to cross all classes. During the 1840s New
York had a coterie of working-class young men known as b'hoys who
treated the theater as an extension of the street. One observer of
a performance in the Bowery said that the audience ``heaves
continually in wild and sullen tumult, like a red flannel sea
agitated by some lurid storm ... the yells and screams, the
shuddering oaths and obscene songs tumbling down from the third
tier.'' The b'hoys were such knowledgeable regulars that they would
shout out prompts to Shakespearean actors who forgot their lines.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, though, class divisions increased. Rowdy
``lower-class'' behavior became restricted to other forms of
entertainment, like minstrel shows in the 1840s or vaudeville later
in the century, while the legitimate theater began to take on more
refined manners. Drama, once considered a masculine domain, was
feminized. Shopping districts grew around theaters; fashion became
important; a matinee audience of women developed. By 1910 women may
have made up three-quarters of the American theater audience.
</P>
<P>
   While the working classes were still actively engaged in variety
shows, within the theater an elevated notion of art was put
forward, encouraging passivity. Those who failed to appreciate art
were considered as rude as those who had once lobbied for silence.
One magazine mocked bored, wealthy theatergoers who ``came an act
late, left an act early, slept during the second act and talked in
between times.'' Silent attentiveness was expected.
</P>
<P>
   So the audience, once an active participant, became a passive
recipient, a transformation, Butsch argues, that was amplified by
the development of movies, radio and television. The participatory
tumult of the theater was supplanted by the private experience of
the screen. To Butsch, all this seems a decline of sorts, in which
political vitality and communal experience is sacrificed for the
sake of private entertainment. He often appears drawn to what was
lost with ``the establishment of middle-class decorum.''
</P>
<P>
   Butsch's two distinctions, active-passive and public-private,
are important. But the transformations are not clear-cut, and their
meanings are ambiguous. Was the debate over audience behavior, for
example, just a matter of ``class-based fears of lower-class
disorder''?
</P>
<P>
   Demands for decorum may not have been just political. There are,
after all, major differences between a vaudeville show and a
performance of ``Othello,'' differences in complexity, nuance,
beauty, construction, density and wit. More subtle aesthetic
perceptions may have led to demands for greater decorum.
</P>
<P>
   There are, then, distinctions to be made that go beyond gender,
race and class. And if, as Butsch asserts, the history of American
audiences raises many issues that are still urgent in contemporary
life, this one may be worth examining more closely.

&HT;     GOP CONGRESSMAN HITS LEADERSHIP ON PHYSICIANS' BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Tom Campbell said Friday he is ``outraged''
that House Republican leaders blocked his bill that would let
physicians bargain collectively with health insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, a Republican from Campbell, Calif., said House Speaker
J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., blocked the bill from going to the House
floor because Republican House members feared it would cost them
campaign contributions from physicians or the insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's bill to end the federal rule banning self-employed
doctors from joining together to negotiate with insurance plans is
supported by physicians and opposed by health insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   He said his bill has 223 co-sponsors, enough for victory.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said many of his House colleagues told him: ``Don't
force me to choose between two important contributors, doctors and
insurance.'' Campbell said House members urged him to delay the
vote ``so we can milk both cows.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association, a leading physicians'
organization that supports the bill, says the managed care industry
has been able to make doctors sign contracts that force them to
rush patients and cut corners on medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Health insurers in the managed care industry claim Campbell's
plan would lead to higher medical costs and give physicians too
much clout.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1999-2000 election cycle, physicians gave Democratic
candidates at the federal level $4.2 million and Republican
candidates about $7.6 million, according to the Center for
Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan Washington research group.
</P>
<P>
   Also during that cycle, insurance companies in general shelled
out $7.3 million to Democrats and $12.8 million to Republicans,
according to the research group.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said Hastert twice promised him to bring up the bill
for a vote and has twice broken his promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I've gotten a promise face to face and
it's been broken,'' Campbell said. ``I want to express a sense of
personal outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said he got a phone call from a staffer at 1:30 a.m.
Thursday telling him the House Rules Committee, which sets up rules
for floor debate at the speaker's behest, declined to bring
Campbell's bill to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert spokesman John Feehery said the House ran out of time to
take up the bill before the Memorial Day recess but that it would
come up again later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell has little to lose in criticizing the speaker because
he has given up his House seat to run for the U.S. Senate seat held
by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said Sens. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and Chuck Schumer,
D-N.Y., have offered to bring up a companion bill in that chamber.

A TASTE OF THE TROPICS, BY WAY OF FLORIDA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., May 28)  
 By MARTY ROSS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   My grandmother's fancy rose garden was just a short hop from her
screened porch, but I always preferred to play under the trees, and
my memories of the endless Southern summers of my childhood are
tinged with the cool colors of caladiums: pink, wine-red, silver
and white, touched with green, flashing in the shade under
evergreen oaks, in planters on porches, and at the hearts of formal
flower beds edged with dark ropes of liriope or tidy, knee-high
hedges of boxwood. Everyone had them, and ribbons of caladiums
seemed to lace the town serenely together.
</P>
<P>
   Caladiums were actually having a little renaissance when I was a
girl in the 1950s, and then they seemed to disappear for a while,
at about the same time so many families moved to the suburbs, to
large but relentlessly sunny gardens; caladiums do best in dappled
shade. Now that trees have grown up in the suburbs, caladiums are
coming back.
</P>
<P>
   Caladiums are tubers, members of the arum family
(elephant's-ears are also arums) and native to tropical South
America. There are seven species in the genus (some experts say
12), but the varieties in commercial production today are hybrids
of only two: C. bicolor, called fancy-leaf caladium, which has
large, heart-shaped leaves and grows to two feet tall, and C.
picturatum, the parent of the lance-leaf caladiums, which grows to
only a foot and produces a mass of narrow, ruffled leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the world's commercial caladium crop is produced by 14
growers in Florida, who grow 50 million tubers a year in black
sawgrass fields around Lake Placid and Sebring, just south of
Orlando. After a heavy rain, alligators and otters are sometimes
encountered in the fields, under the low canopy of fantastically
splotched and marbled leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Caladium bicolor, which has green leaves with red and white
spots, was first described in print in 1800, by which time it had
been brought to France. There seems to be little word of fancy
hybrids until 1867, when Louis Van Houtte and Alfred Bleu exhibited
a number of new caladium varieties at the Paris Exposition.
Triomphe de l'Exposition, with bright red veins radiating from a
central star, was the pride of their display. As late as the 1950s,
it remained a staple of the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Triomphe de l'Exposition has now almost disappeared from the
market, but Candidum, Monsieur Bleu's real masterpiece, which has
large translucent white leaves with dark green veins, is still one
of the most popular varieties available.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred new caladium varieties were introduced at the
Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, and they were quite the
rage in the United States for the next four decades. Henry
Nehrling, who seems to have grown nearly every available variety in
his garden in Gotha, Fla., introduced perhaps 40 new caladiums to
commercial production before his death in 1929. Only a handful of
those are available today.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in caladiums has picked up again with the general new
enthusiasm for tropical plants of all kinds. For the last few
years, suppliers have been unable to keep up with the demand. New
hybrids are again coming on the market. Dr. Gary Wilfret, professor
of environmental horticulture at the University of Florida at
Bradenton, has been working to develop sun-tolerant caladiums and
varieties that can stand temperatures in the '50s. The market is
hot, and Wilfret says he expects to release a couple of new hybrids
every year for the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The most successful of Wilfret's introductions is Florida
Sweetheart, a rosy-leaved cross between fancy-leaf and lance-leaf
caladiums that looks very pretty in hanging baskets. It develops a
pink blush in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Caladiums are strictly annual plants for most American
gardeners. They thrive in moist, well-drained soil and require
warmth to flourish _ planting caladiums before temperatures are a
reliable 65 degrees damages the tubers. In temperate climates,
caladiums should be planted in early summer (June 1 to June 15 in
the Northeast), with two inches of soil over the tuber's smooth
top. Most varieties develop their colors best in shade. Given ample
moisture, the plants will produce dozens of leaves during the
summer. The tubers can be dug up and stored over the winter, but
they must be kept warm (70 degrees) or they will rot.
</P>
<P>
   Extraordinary powers, including the capacity ``to make children
teachable,'' have been attributed to species caladiums in South
America.
</P>
<P>
   They were highly valued as ``beenas,'' or charms, by the Indians
of British Guiana, who often rubbed caladium leaves on their skin
or clothing to secure love, happiness and a healthy appetite. The
swallow beena, Caladium humboldtii, had the power to bring back
distant friends. The effectiveness of the money beena, a caladium
with white blotches, was enhanced if a sixpence was tucked under a
tuber planted in a pot.
</P>
<P>
   I'm charmed. I'm going to put a dime under each caladium I plant
this summer and forget about the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Caladiums are available by mail from Bates Sons &AMP; Daughters, 81
Bates Road, Lake Placid, Fla. 33852; (863) 465-3274; catalog is
free. And from Fancy Leaf Caladiums, County Road 621 East, Lake
Placid, Fla. 33852; (863) 465-0044; catalog is free. &QL;

`ZOMBIE COLLEGE': WEB SERIAL RIVETNG EXCEPTION TO USUAL FODDER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   In the last year the Internet has bred its own school of
do-it-yourself mass entertainment in the form of Flash animation, a
relatively easy-to-use software tool that has made online animators
out of novices.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these shorts are amateurish, sophomoric or extremely
slow-moving, but there are exceptions. One is ``Zombie College,''
which for this critic has made the Internet a rival to television.
Nearly every Wednesday _ sometimes there are Internet reruns _ a
new episode of ``Zombie College'' pops up on the powerhouse
animation site www.icebox.com, which has amassed a team of
producers and writers associated with television programs like
``The Simpsons,'' ``King of the Hill,'' ``Seinfeld'' and
``X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Flash animation programs run just a few minutes and either
merge the chills of a science fiction cliffhanger with the warm
charm of a stuffed animal or, for the adolescent male, offer
interactive superhero stories. The programs lean toward the bizarre
and conceptual _ an extraterrestrial implanted with the brain of a
redneck, a freckled prepubescent pimp, a monkey and chicken working
for NASA _ but at the same time the plots are often light and about
everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Flash animation sites include www.mediatrip.com,
www.campchaos.com, www.shockwave.com, www.spumco.com and
hotwired.lycos.com/animation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zombie College'' revolves around a pair of high school lovers,
Scott and Zelda _ the Fitzgerald allusion stops there _ who are
leaving for their freshman year of college. Scott turns down
admission to MIT so he can join his loved one at Arkford
University, also known as Zombie College, an integrated school
where living students warily mingle with undead ones _ the civil
rights allusion stops there _ who eat human brains.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins when Zelda tells Scott she wants to start
seeing other men, leaving the sensitive genius Scott stranded in
the ``Revenge of the Nerds''-like world of a zombie fraternity
house.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty silly, but in the hands of its creator, Eric Kaplan (a
producer of ``Futurama''), and the animation director, John Rice
(``The Simpsons,'' ``King of the Hill''), ``Zombie College'' comes
to life. The music is original and catchy, the characters are
animated with depth and personality, the voices are believable and
effective, the plot is relentless and irresistible, and, most
important, every episode is smart and funny. Each week the story
takes unexpected twists and turns until, at the end of the
program's four minutes, one is left wondering how Kaplan is going
to get his characters out of the corner he's painted them into.
</P>
<P>
   In the great Internet sweepstakes, well-financed sites like
Icebox have been racing to mine what they call content from an
entertainment world in which everyone seems to be available to the
highest bidder. This often results in well-known names being given
tantalizing stock packages to put any old thing _ a throwaway song,
200 words of text, a minute-long interview snippet, a photograph of
an old sock _ on a Web site to make it attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
   But in the rush for content, entertainment is getting brushed
aside, a nuisance to deal with at some future date. ``Zombie
College,'' however, is a world crafted with care, in which the
quirkily drawn zombies are capable of sucking your brains out as
quickly as a Sunday night of prime-time animation on Fox.

<P>
   SITKA, Alaska _ Carved by ice and washed by as much as 12 feet
of rain a year, the Tongass National Forest stretches across
Alaska's panhandle, full of coastal fjords and majestic strands of
spruce, cedar and hemlock that John Muir described in 1879 as a
seemingly ``indefinite, on-leading expansiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at 17 million acres, the Tongass is more than three
times the size of any other national forest. But as the Clinton
administration promotes its far-reaching plan to safeguard the
forests by banning the building of new roads throughout much of the
system, the Tongass has a curious distinction: It is the one
national forest specifically exempted from such a ban.
</P>
<P>
   There are already more than 4,000 miles of logging roads snaking
through the rain forest here, built as part of the United States'
most heavily subsidized logging program, one that costs taxpayers
about $30 million a year but is fiercely defended by Alaska's tiny
but powerful congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   With 400 miles of new federal logging roads slated to be built
in the Tongass rain forest over the next four years, the exemption
has already set off a battle between national environmental groups
and the timber industry.
</P>
<P>
   And here in southeast Alaska, where the tourism industry now
outpaces timber as a source of jobs, the debate over whether to
build more logging roads in the world's largest remaining stretch
of temperate rain forest is also surprisingly spirited, in a way
that would have been unthinkable a generation ago when logging was
seen as the great spur to jobs in the sparsely populated area.
</P>
<P>
   While logging interests complain that environmental restrictions
have already cost the region hundreds of good jobs over the years
and closed down two big mills, many of those who make their money
by guiding tourists and sport fishermen through the spectacular
inlets and past the emerald forests favor more protections and even
an end to any clear-cutting in the Tongass.
</P>
<P>
   And while almost everyone here agrees that the United States'
largest, wildest national forest holds great resources, the core
question in the debate is how much of an economic resource the
untouched wilderness is.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Alaskans don't like what we are inevitably becoming _
a place where people come to see it, rather than to exploit it,''
said Richard Nelson, a writer and cultural anthropologist who is on
the board of the Sitka Conservation Society, an environmental group
that supports including the Tongass in President Clinton's ban on
new roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole frontier philosophy, the whole
conquest-of-wilderness mentality, is certainly alive and well
here,'' Nelson said. ``But there is a whole opposite ethic that is
growing fast.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that much of the battle over what to do
with the Tongass will be fought in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For environmentalists, ``leaving the Tongass out of this plan is
like deciding to protect all national parks except Yellowstone,''
said Matthew Zencey, the Washington-based manager of the Alaska
Rainforest Campaign, an umbrella coalition that hopes to get much
of the forest protected by a road ban.
</P>
<P>
   The timber industry is similarly animated, saying the Tongass is
already subject to a federal ``management plan'' that balances
wilderness protection in the area with a prudent amount of logging.
The administration, in fact, cited that plan in exempting Tongass
from its road restrictions, although other areas also have
management plans.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the exemption have suggested that the
administration was merely trying to avoid picking a fight with
Alaska's senators, who both chair committees that have authority
over the forest service.
</P>
<P>
   But as the land-use struggle continues thousands of miles away,
people who live here are also clearly divided over whether the
forest is chiefly useful for timber or tourism, or both in equal
measure.
</P>
<P>
   In Sitka, the one-time capital of Russian America, which is
ringed by forests, sea and a snow-covered volcano on a nearby
island, the city split a few years ago (1,702 against, 1,068 for)
when a nonbinding measure was put on the local ballot to make it
the city's official policy to oppose clear-cutting in the nearby
national forest.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism and fishing now outrank the timber industry as sources
of jobs in southeast Alaska, according to the state's Department of
Labor and Workforce Development, a radical change from the
situation 25 years ago. Logging industry officials attribute it to
protections that environmentalists have already secured for the
Tongass.
</P>
<P>
   One came in the Carter administration, setting aside more than 5
million acres as wilderness, and another in the Bush
administration, when Congress agreed to phase out much of a subsidy
that was allowing two major timber companies to pay as little as $2
for huge Sitka spruce logs that would fetch about $300 on the open
market.
</P>
<P>
   The subsidy dated to the 1950s, when the U.S. Forest Service
agreed to provide a steady supply of timber at low prices to two
companies that agreed to build pulp mills in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Both of those mills are closed now _ one near here may be
reconverted into a privately owned water-bottling plant, under a
plan that is still being negotiated _ and the area now has about
700,000 tourists every summer, more than double the number a decade
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many come in the cruise ships that glide by the magnificent
scenery and dock in and around the coastal towns. Others come to
fish with one of the dozens of guide companies that advertise their
services in what many call ``the salmon capital of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is all well and good, but there is no reason for that
industry not to coexist with continued logging, said Sen. Frank
Murkowski, R-Alaska, who is chairman of a committee that oversees
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``So a tourist in Alaska comes in on a boat, and he gets off in
Ketchikan or Juneau and maybe spends a little money here, spends a
little money there, and gets back on the boat,'' Murkowski said in
a telephone interview from Washington. ``That's important. It's a
significant contribution. But it's not sufficient. What we really
do well is, we grow timber and we grow fish. And they're both
renewable if you do it correctly.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he added: ``If we've done such a bad job with this
forest in Alaska, then why is it still so scenic today for tourism?
Why do so many people still want to come here?''
</P>
<P>
   Under the president's plan, the U.S. Forest Service would ban
road building in areas of the national forests where there are
currently no roads. The plan would protect about 43 million acres
that could be logged, roughly one-quarter of the 192 million acres
in the national forest system.
</P>
<P>
   That would reduce planned timber harvests, now at about 3.6
billion board feet a year, by about 700 million board feet. (There
are about 10,000 board feet of lumber in an average-size American
home.)
</P>
<P>
   But under the administration's recently announced preference, no
such ban would apply in the 17-million-acre Tongass forest, and a
decision on whether to impose a ban would not be made until 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would thus let proposed road building proceed in about
2 million acres of the forest. Another 6 million would be protected
if the national standards were applied to the Tongass.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service's program in the Tongass already operates at
a deficit of about $30 million a year, meaning that the federal
government pays more to build roads and maintain the forest than it
takes in from timber companies, which grind most of the trees to a
pulp that is sold for export, mainly to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   That subsidy used to be even larger, and the existing program
remains popular in some quarters here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we manage forests at a net loss for the taxpayer,'' said
Bob Weinstein, the mayor of Ketchikan, a timber town at the
southeastern tip of the state. ``But that doesn't bother me until
such time as the United States government eliminates every direct
or indirect subsidy for any business.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein has tried to spark a campaign in response to any
possibility that the Clinton administration might include the
Tongass in its road ban. And he said that logging areas were
typically well out of the view of tourists anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are cuts,'' he said, ``the Forest Service has made
sure they can't be seen from passing cruise ships.''
</P>
<P>
   The lush growing areas most prized by logging companies,
however, are precisely the same areas that are most critical for
wildlife habitat, conservationists say. The region, roughly the
size of West Virginia, has one of the largest concentrations of
bald eagles and grizzly bears anywhere in the world and is also
considered one of the largest stretches left of temperate (as
opposed to tropical) rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   James Lyons, the assistant agriculture secretary in charge of
the Forest Service, said the Tongass was exempted from a road ban
under the recent proposal because it had already been subject to an
intensive review process lasting several years and resulting in a
1997 ``management plan'' aimed at balancing wilderness protection
with continued logging.
</P>
<P>
   Total logging in the forest now amounts to about 150 million
board feet annually, having steadily dropped from a high of 590
million board feet in 1973. Environmental groups said that areas
served by existing logging roads already provided enough land for a
sustainable timber harvest, and that the road ban should be
extended here.
</P>
<P>
   But Murkowski said the logging statistics indicated that
environmentalists had already gotten the upper hand in the Tongass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they want it all,'' he said. ``Have you ever met with an
environmental group that's satisfied? If they were satisfied, they
wouldn't have a cause. They'd have to shut up shop and retire.
That's what's going on here.''
</P>
<P>
   Logging industry officials also said they were extremely
skeptical of environmentalists' claims that tourism would be the
economic lifeblood of the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they get finished shutting down logging, they're going to
go after the cruise ships,'' said Jack Phelps, executive director
of the Alaska Forest Association, a trade group based in Ketchikan.
``They think they're too many people coming here.''
</P>
<P>
   And indeed there is evidence that some Alaskans feel they are
overrun with tourists: Juneau has slapped visitors' fees on those
who arrive by boat, and Sitka residents voted down a proposal to
build a dock that would have allowed more cruise ships to moor in
town rather than out in the bay. (Many cruise ships offload their
passengers onto smaller boats to take them into town.)
</P>
<P>
   But Eric Jordan, a second-generation fisherman in Sitka who also
runs a guide business, said the local economy was stronger today
than when the mill went out of business. The air and waters were
much cleaner too, Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the mill actually closed and that cloud of smoke was
lifted, both psychologically and literally, an amazing thing
happened,'' he said. ``Property values shot up, and they've been
going up ever since. The reality was more palatable than dealing
with this constant threat that the economy would collapse if the
mill went. I really think the psychology of the town has brightened
in a lot of respects.''

CONSERVATIVE LAWMAKERS SEEK TO BOTTLE UP RIVER FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Southern Exposure is the weekly political notebook from the
Washington Bureau of the New York Times Regional Newspapers)
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARL HULSE &QC;  &QL; 
NYT Regional Newspapers &QC;  &QL; 
 &LR;  WASHINGTON _ After losing a Supreme Court challenge, conservative
lawmakers are following a more circuitous route in their determined
efforts to sink President Clinton's American Heritage Rivers
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the program created by executive order in 1997
quietly inserted a provision into a pending Agriculture Department
spending bill that would prohibit the agency from spending money on
revitalizing 14 selected rivers. Similar language adopted last year
blocked Pentagon and Interior Department funds from being spent on
the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Since the initiative depends on using existing staff and
resources from executive agencies, congressional backers of the
program worry such restrictions will strangle an undertaking that
is popular in the river communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fear this legislative attack will spread like a computer
virus and infect the remaining appropriations bills,'' wrote
Democratic Reps. Corrine Brown of Florida and William Jefferson of
Louisiana in a letter urging their colleagues to kill the
provision. The effort has Republican support as well.
</P>
<P>
   Under the initiative, special ``navigators'' are appointed for
the individual rivers to help communities seek federal aid for
environmental and economic restoration projects. More than 120
rivers competed for the designation, which was bestowed upon the
Lower Mississippi in Louisiana and Tennessee, the St. Johns in
Florida and the New in North Carolina among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Heritage Rivers initiative ensures that federal
agencies become better partners with communities,'' wrote GOP Reps.
Sue Kelly of New York and Paul Kanjorski of Pennsylvania, both of
whom represent states containing American Heritage rivers.
</P>
<P>
   But conservatives have from the start objected to the initiative
as an illegal use of executive power and a back-door attempt by the
Clinton administration to gain more authority over land along the
rivers. Some GOP lawmakers specifically requested that waterways in
their districts be excluded.
</P>
<P>
   Four western lawmakers challenged the president's authority to
create the program but the high court in March refused to hear the
appeal of two lower court decisions rejecting the congressional
claims.
</P>
<P>
   DAY CARE DILEMMA
</P>
<P>
   Southern states are banding together to explore ways to help
low-income parents with one of their most persistent economic
problems _ how to find affordable day care that will allow them to
get ahead by working full-time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all of the Southern states, a young family with two-wage
earners at minimum wage could easily spend a third of their gross
pay on child care,'' said Louise Stoney, a child care consultant
working with the Southern Institute on Children and Families.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina-based institute has formed a task force
consisting of representatives appointed by Southern governors to
find ways to ease access to child care assistance for poor
families, many of whom might not know such help is available. Its
report will be issued next year.
</P>
<P>
   COUNTDOWN FOR ECSTASY
</P>
<P>
   The designer drug Ecstasy may be all the rave at dance clubs but
it is not too popular on Capitol Hill. A group of lawmakers is
pressing for stiffer penalties for importing, manufacturing and
distributing the drug that is becoming a favorite of teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ecstasy is a proven killer and it is on the loose,'' said Sen.
Bob Graham, D-Fla. ``We need to shatter the dangerous myth that
this risky designer drug is safe for consumption.'' He and others
say the drug can elevate heart rates to potentially fatal levels.
</P>
<P>
   The measure proposed by Graham and fellow members of the Senate
Caucus on Drug Control would equate trafficking in Ecstasy with
dealing in methamphetamine, which would significantly boost
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   GOING WHOLE HOG
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups fear new regulations on corporate farming
set to be issued by the Environmental Protection Agency are going
to be far too weak from their perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Based on their review of EPA drafts and discussions with agency
officials, representatives of the Southern Environmental Law Center
and other organizations say the rules could institutionalize the
animal waste lagoons blamed for pollution in some Southern states.
</P>
<P>
   ``A typical hog farm produces as much waste as a small city,'
said Tim Searchinger, attorney for Environmental Defense. ``Yet the
anticipated policy would do little more than legitimize the
existing, nearly uncontrolled way these factory farms operate.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups are pushing for much more stringent regulations
opposed by the agriculture industry, which contends the lagoons are
safe.

 DISNEY UNlEASHES DINOSAURS ON NEW CD  
 By LONNIE BROWN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is the movie: ``Dinosaur.'' There is the toy based on the
movie that is available from a nationwide hamburger chain.
</P>
<P>
   Through July 9, ``Sue,'' an exact cast replica of the largest,
most complete Tyrannosaurus rex fossil ever found, will be on
display at Walt Disney World's Animal Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   And Disney does not think the dinosaur theme is extinct yet.
There is, of course, the CD-ROM: Disney's Dinosaur Activity Center.
Disney also has taken the opportunity to cross-market products.
There is a pre-paid child's admission ticket included to see
``Dinosaur,'' which can also be used for any Disney picture running
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The CD has been released to coincide with the family feature
from Disney that opened last weekend. The Windows/Macintosh CD
(about $30) is designed for children ages 5 and up.
</P>
<P>
   There are a total of five games and activities to help children
learn about the evolution and eventual extinction of dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Line O'Dinos Puzzle Maker'' lets children create their own
dinosaur and then record their own voices, or use a pre-recorded
one from the program, to make the dinosaur roar. The puzzles can be
e-mailed to friends or printed.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Colossal Fossil Face-off'' is a strategy game to help
children with reasoning powers.
</P>
<P>
   The child leads a dinosaur team to take back an egg from a group
of carnotaurs. The game uses fact cards to help children learn more
about the characteristics of various dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   The three remaining activities are arcade games. The ``Lemur
Love Match'' teaches comparisons by having children match flowers
while racing a time clock in order to move to the next level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stegasaurus Spelunker'' is centered around combining sets of
three objects to escape from rock-filled caves.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   CARD STUDIO DELUXE
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of holidays, birthdays and anniversaries left
in the year. The Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe can take care of all
of them _ including National Columnist Day on June 27. Some other
holidays that are equally obscure for card-sending: National
Splurge Day (June 18) and Employee Appreciation Day (March 10).
</P>
<P>
   The Windows-based program (about $50) has more than 3,000
ready-made cards that can be easily edited to personalize the
graphics or messages.
</P>
<P>
   SierraHome, the software's publishers, estimate there are
600,000 ways to create cards and projects for friends.
</P>
<P>
   The program has more than 150 project templates _ calendars,
photo greetings, envelopes, stationery, postcards and other items.
</P>
<P>
   It also has nearly two dozen specialty fonts, and 10,000 pieces
of clip art and pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The program includes SnapShot Express, a set of editing tools
for adding photos to cards. An event planner, also included with
the program, has a ``kid lock'' feature to keep children from
seeing any content parents want to keep from them.

 &HT;    Rally to call for release of Al-Amin
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the country's most outspoken black nationalists will call
for the release of Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin today at a noon rally in
Woodruff Park.
</P>
<P>
   Khallid Abdul Muhammad, the national chairman of the New Black
Panther Party, will be in town for an ``offensive effort to free
'H. Rap Brown,' our comrade and unjustly incarcerated brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin, formerly known as H. Rap Brown, briefly served as
minister of justice for the Black Panthers in 1968. He is in the
Cobb County Jail, charged with murder in the slaying of a Fulton
County sheriff's deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Malik Shabazz, the minister of justice for the New Black Panther
Party, said several veteran black activists from Atlanta will be
involved in the rally, although he would not release their names.
</P>
<P>
   Nadim Ali, a spokesman for the Community Mosque headed by
Al-Amin, said the mosque is not affiliated with the New Black
Panther Party or today's rally.
</P>
<P>
   The New Black Panther Party was organized in 1989 in Dallas.
Muhammad, the former national spokesman for the Nation of Islam,
was voted national chairman of the New Black Panthers in the
mid-1990s after Louis Farrakhan kicked him out of the Nation for
making anti-Semitic remarks.

<TEXT>
<P>
   VOLOGDA, Russia _ As any gourmand around here will tell you,
there are but two types of butter in Russia. There is ordinary,
bland butter, bought by ordinary, bland people and consumed on
ordinary, bland occasions. And there is Vologda Butter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Vologodskoye Maslo &LR; : The name fairly trips off the tongue _ the
Russian tongue, anyway. This is butter so cultured that it was
originally called Parisian butter (about which more later), even
though it is made in Vologda oblast, a vaguely
Massachusetts-shaped, almost New York-sized province 250 miles
northeast of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   This is creamy, melt-in-your mouth butter. This is
infarction-inducing butter, butter no less than 82.5 per cent pure
milkfat, by order of the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
   This is expensive butter. This is also profitable butter.
</P>
<P>
   This is why some scruple-deprived people are making counterfeit
Vologda Butter, and pawning it off on hapless Russians as the Real
Thing.
</P>
<P>
   And this is why Vladimir V. Mizgirev is angry.
</P>
<P>
   To be honest, Vladimir V. Mizgirev appears more hurt than angry.
</P>
<P>
   Mizgirev, a thin, slightly balding, pleasant but serious man, is
general director of the Vologda Dairy Factory. In all Vologda
oblast, there are but three dairies that make Vologda Butter, and
Mizgirev's is the biggest by far.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows Mizgirev's butter. It is sold not only in the
usual squat foil-wrapped rectangles, but in bigger imitation-wood
barrels which are instantly recognizable in better stores. He
displays both packages _ empty, of course _ on a shelf in his
office, along with other Vologda Dairy Factory products like
chocolate butter and cheese. But Vologda Butter is the company
flagship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we sold 110 tons,'' he said. ``Our product is sold
in Arkhangelsk _ 17 per cent there. Moscow region, 15 per cent.
Yaroslavl region, 14 or 15 per cent. And so on.''
</P>
<P>
   The three makers of Vologda Butter do not know how much of their
market the counterfeit butter hawkers have stolen, but Mizgirev
believes it is considerable. ``If you take Russia as a whole,'' he
said, ``the producers of Vologda Butter have lost millions of
rubles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, there are criminals behind this,'' he added, darkly.
But that is getting ahead of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Vologda Butter ``so good that unscrupulous people
counterfeit it,'' a phrase that is not the company's advertising
slogan, but could be. The answer is not simple.
</P>
<P>
   Tradition is one reason. The first creameries appeared here in
1835, and Vologda boasts the first cream separator in all Russia.
Butter-making has been an industry here since 1881, begun in the
aptly named village of Molochnoye, or Milky.
</P>
<P>
   But the tale really begins with Nikolai V. Vereschagin (b.
1839), founder of the Milk Academy of Vologda, operator of the
nation's first, and presumably the only, butter-making school, and
noted turn-of-the-last-century expert on dairy innovation.
</P>
<P>
   It was Vereschagin who noticed that ordinary butter sometimes
seemed sour, and set about to fix that. Experimenting, he tried
separating sweet cream from milk twice during butter-making, rather
than once, as was the usual practice.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a king among butters. It was fattier than the
70-percent-fat butter produced by one round of separation, and
creamier as well. It had no odor, a delicious walnutty taste and
utterly no aftertaste, thanks to its remarkable 16-to-18 Turner
degrees of acidity.
</P>
<P>
   This, then, was real Vologda Butter.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, actually, it was real Parisian Butter, winner of
the prestigious gold medal at the turn-of-the-last-century Paris
Exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Remote Vologda had become the buttered toast of Europe, its
superior recipe demanded by better classes of people across the
Continent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1916, entrepreneurs set up the Vologda Dairy Factory to make
Parisian Butter. This was exceptionally bad timing: In 1917, Russia
turned communist, and seized all private property. Later the
Soviets banned Parisian Butter exports. In 1939, they changed its
decadent Western name to Vologda Butter. And Europeans forgot all
about it.
</P>
<P>
   There it languished, a butter without honor in its own country,
until communism fell in 1991 and state-owned enterprises _ among
them the Vologda Dairy Factory _ began to be turned over to private
owners.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mizgirev, a two-decade veteran of the dairy industry, was one of
them. He vowed to resurrect the glory days of Vologda Butter. He
turned the Vologda Dairy Factory into a spic-and-span milk palace.
He made workers and visitors don clean uniforms before entering
production lines, lest they bring dirt or germs from the outside.
And soon, his strategy began to work.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Vologda Dairy Factory and its butter captured the
gold medal at the Moscow Agricultural-Industrial Exhibition. A
competing brand paid tribute to Vologda Butter's cachet, adopting
the catchy, snob-appeal slogan ``Rama Margarine Smells Like Vologda
Butter.'' ``The governor said we should thank them for advertising
our product,'' Mizgirev said.
</P>
<P>
   But such bliss was not to last. Behind the scenes, forces
already were at work, purloining Vologda Butter's customers and
undermining its hard-won reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Mizgirev cannot remember when he first heard the bad news, but
the somber details are etched in his memory. In Vologda region, old
government-surplus butter began turning up on store shelves with
the label ``Vologda Butter.'' Buyers told him some stores were
carrying so-called Vologda Butter that was actually margarine.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers complained that wrappers of the Vologda Butter they
had bought bore a spine-chilling notice in eye-straining type:
``Made in Finland.'' Mizgirev complained bitterly to the
authorities, but to no avail. The Vologda Dairy Factory adopted a
symbol for all its packages, an oval portrait of a fetching young
milkmaid, as a signal of authenticity. It paid a major Moscow
newspaper to publish an article about the merits of genuine Vologda
Butter as opposed to cheap imitations.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the three Vologda butter-makers tried legal maneuvers,
eventually securing a trademark for the name ``Vologodskoye
Maslo.'' But the butter counterfeiters were a wily bunch: They
eschewed ``Vologodskoye Maslo,'' in which the region's name is an
adjective, in favor of ``Vologda Maslo,'' in which region's name
was a noun.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us that because it wasn't the exact name, there was
nothing we could do,'' Mizgirev said.
</P>
<P>
   But even at a latitude that endures 19 hours of daylight in the
summer and five in the winter, it is always darkest before the
dawn. And in the blackest hours of Vologda's bitter battle for
better butter, the forces of light reached deep, and found new
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Rising to defend its own, the Vologda Chamber of Trade and
Commerce has launched a lobbying campaign to persuade Moscow to
restrict production of Vologda Butter to Vologda oblast, much as
bourbon production is confined to Kentucky and champagne making to
France.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of now it hasn't been regulated,'' Mizgirev said, ``but we
think it will come to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, the butter-makers themselves have struck
a blow at last against their tormentors.
</P>
<P>
   One of the oblast's three butter manufacturers, the Experimental
Firm, persuaded the chamber long ago to file a complaint about
butter counterfeiters with the federal anti-monopoly commission.
The case wound through Russia's labyrinthine bureaucracy for three
years.
</P>
<P>
   But on May 16, the regulatory commission issued a verdict: A
Moscow company named Havana-M had improperly used the Vologda
Butter trademark, and was ordered to stop.
</P>
<P>
   A small victory, Mizgirev allowed this week, but a significant
one.
</P>
<P>
   For if butter justice has prevailed in Vologda, can justice in
all Russia be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   ``The country is moving toward discipline and order,'' he said.
``The anarchy we had, where anyone could do anything, is passing.
Not for nothing do I say that things are chaning for the better.''

PAKISTAN TO CRACK DOWN ON RAMPANT TAX EVASION 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ ``WARNING!'' scream the big daily ads in
the newspapers. ``All taxpayers are warned that a comprehensive tax
survey is being launched soon in which your concealed income and
assets will be unearthed.''
</P>
<P>
   In many countries, such an admonition might strike fear among a
minority who forget, fudge or outright refuse to file. But here in
Pakistan, where taxes have yet to join death as one of life's
inevitabilities, the warning applies to just about everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The military government, nearly eight months after it seized
power, is trying to do what before has proven impossible: find out
who owes how much and make them pay.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Saturday, teams of soldiers and revenue officers will
start delivering tax survey forms to businesses and homes in 13
major cities. The government wants to know about inventory,
purchases, rents, utility bills and employees. The penalty for
ignoring the form can be as much as three months in jail, and the
punishment for lying is up to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Pakistan and elsewhere consider the tax crackdown a
major test of mettle for Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the military ruler
who uses the title of chief executive: The nation is $38 billion in
debt. Can he snatch solvency from the jaws of default?
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever forbearance the international community has had for
this military government has come with the idea that it can take
decisions that a political government cannot,'' said one Western
diplomat. ``But this government has yet to take on any major
interest group and win.''
</P>
<P>
   While Musharraf presents himself as a tough-talking reformer, he
has backed down from several confrontations, most recently when he
withdrew a change to the nation's blasphemy laws that was opposed
by Islamic fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he is up against a business community that has
considered the payment of taxes as the behavior of suckers. Many
shop owners vow to shutter their stores as soon as the survey teams
enter the neighborhood. An indefinite strike has been threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Umer Sailya, part owner of a Karachi restaurant and chairman of
the Association of Small Traders Organizations, is championing the
resistance. He said that first, the government ought to root out
corruption among its own in the tax department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bureaucracy doesn't want our taxes; they want our
bribes,'' Sailya said in a telephone interview. ``Let the
government first survey the revenue collectors, the civil
bureaucrats, the army and the judiciary. Then they can come survey
the businessmen.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to Sailya's criticism, the government this week
leaked his income tax returns to the press, showing that he paid an
average of only $28 during the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, if that is the case, then Sailya is one of Pakistan's
more upright citizens. In a nation of 150 million, less than 1
percent pay any income tax at all, according to the government. An
estimated 70 percent of the entire economy is run off the books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shameful!'' Musharraf declared Thursday at a televised news
conference that was part pep talk, part fireside chat. ``We should
be ashamed. Only 1.2 million people pay tax.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This is a very poor country _ and for some poverty may be
something of an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to the government, there are 2.5 million business
owners in Pakistan, and only 650,000 of them have even bothered to
register with the income tax authorities. Of those, a meager 17,500
are collecting sales tax, which is not only considered a nuisance
by shopkeepers but can also be used as incriminating evidence of
their own unreported earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The task ahead is momentous,'' said Shaukat Aziz, a former
Citibank vice president who has returned to his native Pakistan as
finance minister. ``We are trying to inculcate a culture of
tax-paying. It is a defining moment for our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's tax survey program has been preceded by its tax
amnesty plan, which is the subject of those newspaper ads as well
as similarly stern ones on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Deadbeats are being offered a ``rare opportunity'' to pay up on
money earned before June 30, 1999. At a bargain tax rate, too: only
10 percent. All else is forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you fail to avail the opportunity, you run the risk of
paying tax at normal rates plus penalty and imprisonment of up to
five years or both,'' the ads warn.
</P>
<P>
   The amnesty offer is four weeks old, and so far it has scared
the stuffing out of very few wallets, bringing in a scant $3
million. Aziz has greater expectations, estimating that 10 times
that amount will be recovered before a June 15 deadline. But even
that is a far cry from the additional 12 billion dollars the
government believes it ought to collect annually.
</P>
<P>
   The finance minister is not without sympathy for those who have
long evaded the tax net. He admits that many in the revenue
department are as dishonest as the day is long. Thursday, he fired
1,000 of the ``most corrupt.'' He said in an interview, ``Will this
eliminate corruption? No. Will it put a check on it? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Aziz was living in New York with a banker's set of
headaches; a year ago, Musharraf was commanding an army that was
fighting a near all-out war with India in the mountains of Kashmir.
These days, they worry a good deal about satisfying the
international lenders who hold the paper on Pakistan's debt.
</P>
<P>
   A team from the International Monetary Fund is in Islamabad this
week, trying to decide whether to re-open the valve on a suspended
flow of loans to Pakistan. For years, the lenders have been
demanding the kind of tax collection now being undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   This week, they will be hoping to see people paying up instead
of shutting down.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf, who has quite a folksy manner for a stiff-backed
military man, told his nation: ``It's high time we confronted
problems and catch the bull by the horns.''

PETTY FAMILY CARRIES ON 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK ZIER   The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. _ Richard Petty flashed the famous grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's doing real good. As long as everybody stays busy,
it's been real good,'' he said. ``Lynda gets a little emotional
sometimes, but...''
</P>
<P>
   Petty paused. In recent weeks, he and his wife have had to deal
with two enormous personal losses.
</P>
<P>
   First was the April 5 death of his father, Lee, which was not
unexpected. Lee Petty had been sick. Then on May 12, Petty's
19-year-old grandson, Adam, was killed while practicing for a race
at New Hampshire. Now, with great dignity, Richard Petty was trying
to explain the impact that had on the family.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Petty was the shining star of the Petty clan, the next
generation to get in the race car. He carried all the family's
hopes, their dreams, their plans for the future. Now he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pettys will carry on. Racing is their life, it has
always been their life, and it has been good to them. Until now.
</P>
<P>
   So Richard Petty did not find fault with his sport, although he
admitted, in the quiet reflection that followed Adam's death, he
had pangs of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking maybe if I hadn't pushed Kyle, maybe if I
hadn't worked with Adam, maybe this wouldn't have happened,'' Petty
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I picked up a paper and saw where two kids, 17 and 15,
had drowned in separate incidents. They were just trying to have
fun. That kind of lifted the cloud,'' Petty said.
</P>
<P>
   Petty understands that his family is not the first to lose a
child, that more is being made of Adam's death because of who he
was but that anytime a child dies, somebody hurts, somebody feels a
tremendous loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of living is dying, in this case, it just happened a lot
earlier than what we wanted,'' Petty said.``I'm 63, and when you're
63, you learn to go with the flow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know how much impact Adam had. Very few 19-year-olds
touched as many people as Adam has. We've gotten calls and cards
from all over the world, not just from people who wanted to say how
sorry they were, but from people who actually met Adam. The
sympathy we've gotten has been great, and we do appreciate that,''
Petty said. ``But there's nothing we can do, nothing anybody can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Petty Enterprises will continue to field race cars. Kyle
Petty is not racing here this week in the Coca-Cola 600 but he'll
be back next week at Dover, Del. Someone will continue to drive
Petty cars them in the future, although it might not be a Petty.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Petty, Kyle's surviving son, has no interest in driving,
according to Richard. He is 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I see him he's looking at a different career,''
Petty said. ``But as far as being a race car driver, I don't think
he's thought about that.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is time to move on, according to the head of the Petty
clan. One cannot dwell on death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll remember Adam for the smile on his face, the pat on the
back he gave everybody, the joking around. He was a pretty good
kid,'' Petty said. ``He always seemed to get along with everybody.
That's how I'm going to remember him.''

ATWOOD JOINS ELLIOTT ON EVERNHAM TEAM 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. _ Dodge completed the foundation for its 2001
entry into Winston Cup this week when Ray Evernham announced that
Casey Atwood would join Bill Elliott as one of the drivers for his
two-car team.
</P>
<P>
   Evernham, formerly Jeff Gordon's crew chief, is heading up the
Dodge development program that plans a return to Winston Cup in
2001. NASCAR has not approved a design for the Dodge race car, but
Evernham recently tested an Intrepid at Homestead, Fla., and more
tests are planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are making progress in the development of the car,''
Evernham said. ``The engine program is actually ahead of schedule,
so they are kind of dictating our testing program.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to have a car ready to present to NASCAR for approval
by late July or early August,'' he said. ``We were happy with the
first shakedown run and we will have some more announcements in the
next few months.''
</P>
<P>
   Atwood, who is 19, is regarded as one of the top young talents
in racing. At 17, he won the pole for the second Busch race he ever
ran. Last year, in his first full season on the Busch circuit,
Atwood won two races and two poles. He is the youngest driver in
history ever to win a Busch race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casey Atwood is an incredibly talented young driver,''
Evernham said. ``For 19 years of age, he's got a very good
understanding and feel for a race car.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm honored to be part of this team,'' Atwood said. ``This is
what I've been working for all my life.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood now is competing in the Busch Series, where he has won
one pole and recorded three top 10 finishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to lie to you, I'm nervous about moving up,''
Atwood said. ``But I've got the best behind me and it's a great
situation. If it were anything else, I wouldn't have taken it and
stayed in the Busch Series another year.''
</P>
<P>
   With Atwood under contract to Evernham, Dodge now has three
two-car teams ready to go at next year's Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   Petty Enterprises and drivers John Andretti and Kyle Petty along
with Bill Davis' two-car team with drivers Ward Burton and Dave
Blaney are both switching to Dodge from Pontiac.

ELECTION-MONITORING TEAM'S HEAD LEAVES PERU ABRUPTLY 
</HEADLINE>

   LIMA, Peru _ Charging that he had been deceived by Peruvian
officials, the head of the Organization of American States'
observation team angrily left Peru on Friday, two days before the
presidential runoff election that he was supposed to monitor to
prevent voting fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions of the election do not provide a strong basis
of legitimacy,'' said the OAS chief, Eduardo Stein, who was the
senior foreign observer of an election process that had been
tainted with charges of dirty tricks and vote fraud. ``I feel
deceived and disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein's views will be crucial as the regional organization he
represents and the Clinton administration and the U.S. Congress
consider applying economic sanctions against the government of
President Alberto Fujimori. In a report released late Thursday,
after the government's announcement that it would not postpone
Sunday's runoff, Stein's team offered a stinging rebuke to Peru.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Peruvian electoral process is far from one that could be
considered free and fair,'' the observation team said. The team
then ordered its election observers to withdraw from the provinces
and leave Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's election to a third five-year term was effectively
assured when his opponent, Alejandro Toledo, dropped out of the
race last week, claiming that he was not ready to enter ``a butcher
shop'' of fraud in a fixed election.
</P>
<P>
   But Stein, with the full backing of the Clinton administration,
attempted to mediate a solution between Toledo and the government
in which the election could be postponed so that foreign observers
would have ample time to test computer software to make sure the
vote count would be transparent and clean.
</P>
<P>
   Stein, who is a former foreign minister of Guatemala, led the
international criticism of the April 9 first-round vote, saying
``Something sinister is happening here'' as ballots and tally
sheets disappeared for hours without explanation and votes were
counted in undisclosed locations.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori fell just short of winning an outright majority victory
in the first round, according to an official tabulation made over
three days as the United States and other countries pressed for a
runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the first round, Stein has been trying to persuade
the government to stop spending public funds in the Fujimori
campaign and to open television networks to coverage of the
opposition. He has had only limited success.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last couple of days, Stein had expressed new
optimism that an agreement could be worked out, with a new election
date to be set on June 4 or some weeks later. Negotiations had
reached the level where Fujimori was talking directly by telephone
with Cesar Gaviria, the head of the OAS and a former president of
Colombia, according to Peruvian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Stein said he had strong indications as late as midday Thursday
that the Peruvian government would postpone the election, and was
shocked by the news in the afternoon that the National Elections
Commission had voted 3-2 against a postponement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were led to believe that there was going to be a favorable
outcome,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was met with an increase in violent demonstrations
across Peru, including an attack with rocks and Molotov cocktails
on the presidential palace late Thursday. Student and labor groups
are planning demonstrations and strikes to protest the election.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a television interview Friday, Fujimori brushed aside Stein's
complaints. ``Globalization does not mean there can be unlimited
intervention in a country's internal affairs,'' he said. ``The
software problems have been resolved. There will be no fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein also had critical words for Toledo, who offered
inconsistent public positions on the conditions under which he
would re-enter the race. ``His hesitation, tardiness in providing a
clear-cut answer, exhausted the time,'' Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton responded Friday to the news from Peru,
saying, ``Free, fair and open elections are the foundation of a
democratic society. Without them, our relationship with Peru
inevitably will be affected.''

U.S. SAYS MICROSOFT ACTED IRRESPONSIBLY IN TRIAL TACTIC 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department denounced Microsoft Corp. on
Friday, accusing the company of cynical, irresponsible behavior on
the last day of its antitrust trial earlier this week. The
department also filed a modified version of its proposal to break
up the company that includes a handful of small, technical changes
that the judge had requested.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft now has two business days to file a response to the
form but not the substance of the revised proposal. That is
expected Wednesday, and the judge's final ruling in the
long-running antitrust case will most likely come in the following
day or two.
</P>
<P>
   That prospect prompted Microsoft on Friday to postpone a major
public event at the company campus in Redmond, Wash., at which
Microsoft leaders were to describe their visions of the computing
future. It had been scheduled for next Thursday, but was put off
for three weeks because ``there are strong indications'' that Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson will rule next week, a press release said.
</P>
<P>
   The revised government remedy proposal still requests a breakup
of the company and additional restrictions on conduct, exactly as
originally proposed on April 28. The changes are corrections of
typographical errors and small alterations of language to address
concerns the judge raised in court on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   During that hearing, on the trial's last day, the judge strongly
suggested that he was leaning toward breaking up the company. And
Microsoft expressed surprise and disappointment when the judge
announced that he would not hold a separate phase of the trial to
consider a remedy _ complete with depositions, witnesses and
document requests. John Warden, a Microsoft lawyer, told Jackson he
found the idea ``that we would have some final resolution today
really incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a six-page brief filed along with its revised remedy
proposal this afternoon, the Justice Department called that ``just
a cynical ploy calculated to raise diversionary issues on appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day on Wednesday, the brief noted, Microsoft
entered into evidence an ``offer of proof'' listing 16 academic
experts and Microsoft executives who would have been called as
witnesses if remedy hearings had been held, including the company
chairman, William H. Gates. A short time later, company
representatives also handed out dozens of copies to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The government's brief went on to say: ``The fact that Microsoft
had prepared but kept secreted in its briefcases a 35-page offer of
proof, concerning testimony from 16 different witnesses that it
allegedly wanted to offer, itself demonstrates both that Microsoft
was not genuinely surprised about what was expected of it and that
it was perfectly capable of being forthright with the Court but
chose not to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokesman, Mark Murray, called the government brief
``unfortunate,'' and said the company was genuinely surprised to
learn that the judge planned no additional hearings.
</P>
<P>
   At a conference in the judge's chambers on April 4, when
scheduling issues were discussed, the judge's remarks were in some
ways contradictory on this subject. On the one hand he said
emphatically that he intended to wrap up the remedy process within
60 days, by the end of May, saying: `What I do not want is to have
caused this thing to drag on through a number of months of
additional proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Warden, the Microsoft lawyer, asked him:
``Does your honor contemplate further proceedings of some kind or
another after the conclusion of this schedule?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' the judge responded. ``I would assume that there would
be further proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department brief asserts that Microsoft has known
for many months that the government was likely to request a breakup
of the company ``and has had ample opportunity'' to express its
concerns. It says the company could have filed the statements from
Mr. Gates and the others along with its own proposed remedy on May
10, letting the judge know that Gates wanted to testify. But
instead, Microsoft's lawyers waited until after the judge had
already declared that there would be no more hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The government's evident suspicion from this is that the offer
of proof may not have been entirely genuine. But Murray reiterated
that Microsoft had no idea the trial would end on Wednesday.
Company lawyers brought along the offer of proof just out of a
sense of due diligence _ for the off-chance that the judge chose to
close the record.
</P>
<P>
   Had there been further hearings at which Gates had been called
to testify, the Justice Department would have been entitled to
subpoena additional e-mail and other documents from him relating to
the remedy question. Some of his e-mail messages obtained earlier
and shown during the trial undercut the company's legal defense.
</P>
<P>
   The government would also have been able to depose Gates and
cross-examine him on the stand. During his taped deposition in
preparation for the trial, in August 1998, Mr. Gates was halting
and forgetful as he slumped in his chair. His performance did not
help the company's case and may have done damage.
</P>
<P>
   The time to offer Gates' testimony, the government said, should
have been on May 10, the date the judge set for receiving
Microsoft's opinions on remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Murray responded: ``That kind of attitude is completely
unfortunate and completely groundless when you look at the facts.
``Microsoft lived up to its obligations in good faith, 100
percent.''

   The official announcement took no one by surprise: Ford said
last week that it would bring back the Thunderbird, this time as a
two-seat roadster closely modeled on a concept car that was a
sensation at auto shows last year.
</P>
<P>
   The 2002 T-Bird, which goes into production early next year,
will pick up where the 1955-57 left off. For '58, the T-Bird became
a larger, heavier four-seat car, and in later years it grew bloated
and overwrought. But Ford says the next-generation T-Bird is a
modern interpretation of the original, complete with turquoise
emblems and porthole windows in the removable hardtop.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to stir up interest in the new car, even though
dealers have not begun to take orders, Ford is kicking off a
summerlong bird-watching contest that will culminate in a giveaway
of three original T-Birds.

STOCKS CLOSE LOWER, ENDING POOR WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks ended a tough week slightly lower Friday, with
the Dow Jones industrial average at its lowest level since
mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   Trading ahead of the three-day Memorial Day weekend was the
slowest this year, adding to the volatility during the day. But
though Friday's declines were small they added to a sharp drop for
the week. It appeared that the bearish sentiment sparked by the
Federal Reserve's short-term interest rate increase 10 days ago was
still intact.
</P>
<P>
   And when investors return Tuesday, they will still have to face
uncertainty about how much higher the nation's central bank will
push short-term interest rates. And they will be wondering if the
beleaguered technology sector has further to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Richard E. Cripps, the chief market strategist at Legg Mason
Wood Walker in Baltimore, predicted that all three major market
indexes would remain in a trading range, with the bottom a little
below where they are now, until investors sense that the Federal
Reserve has finished raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that investors will have to find new ``drivers''
for the market because he did not expect technology stocks ``to
continue the performance in the future that they have had in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index slipped 0.24 point, to 3,205.11,
while the Dow Jones industrial average fell 24.68 points, or 0.2
percent, to 10,299.24. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
dropped 3.5 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,378.02. Volume on the New
York Stock Exchange was very light, with just 719.88 million shares
changing hands. The daily average for the year is 1.036 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, the Nasdaq fell 5.5 percent. For the year, the
technology-heavy index is down 21.2 percent and is just above its
low for the year, which it reached Tuesday. The Dow fell 3.1
percent for the week and is off 10.4 percent for the year. The Dow
is also now below the level it fell to during the week ending April
14. That 7.3 percent decline was the Dow's worst week since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P declined 2.1 percent for the week and is off 6.2 percent
for the year. It is still 21.46 points above its April 14 level.
</P>
<P>
   Among the big losers for the week were General Motors, down 19
percent, and Georgia Pacific, down 18.3 percent. GM disappointed
investors by limiting participation in an exchange of its stock for
a stake in its Hughes Electronics subsidiary. Georgia-Pacific and
other paper companies fell over concern about falling prices and
fears that rising interest rates would slow economic growth.
Goldman Sachs Group, which dropped 17.4 percent, warned analysts
that second- quarter earnings would be less than expected.
</P>
<P>
   On the technology side, CMGI fell 16.9 percent, Broadvision
dropped 18.6 percent, Qualcomm declined 25.9 percent and Qlogic
slipped 26 percent. Microsoft also had a rough week, falling 5.6
percent. But Intel rallied Friday to finish the week off less than
one-third of a percent.
</P>
<P>
   With every investor looking for signs that the economy is
finally slowing under the weight of the Fed's higher interest
rates, the bond market got a lift from the report that orders for
durable goods fell 6.4 percent in April, more than forecast. The
yield on the Treasury's 10-year note fell to 6.32 percent, from
6.39 percent on Thursday. The price, which moves in the opposite
direction, rose 15/32, to 101 8/32. The yield was down from 6.48
percent a week ago. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 6.06
percent from 6.11 percent on Thursday and was down from 6.20
percent a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of investor sentiment on how much higher the Fed
might push its benchmark federal funds target on overnight loans
between banks is federal funds futures contracts. The contract for
October now shows an average rate for the month of 7.03 percent,
down just slightly from 7.06 percent a week ago. The December
contract is at 7.16 percent. Currently, the Fed's target is at 6.5
percent after the half a percentage point increase on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors have been undermining the technology sector. One
is that the flow of funds into the aggressive growth and technology
stock mutual funds that invest in the technology sector has sharply
declined recently. According to AMG Data Services, the pace of net
inflows into these funds was $6.8 billion over the four weeks
ending March 22. That fell to $3.1 billion in the week ending April
12 and is now down to $948 million in the four weeks ending May 24.
And for the last week, there were net outflows from these funds:
$169 million from technology and $496 million from aggressive
growth funds.
</P>
<P>
   Cripps of Legg Mason also said that money managers and
individual investors were still overloaded with technology stocks.
He said that as these stocks fall further, more investors and
managers will decide they have too many and sell, adding to the
downward pressure on this sector.

COMMENTARY: `WE CAN'T WALK AWAY' 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The violence and chaos of Zimbabwe
cast a shadow on its neighbor these days. South Africa is an
utterly different country, far more developed and sophisticated.
But some in the West fear it will go down the same road.
</P>
<P>
   I asked South Africa's minister of finance, Trevor Manuel, what
he would say to those doubters. What assurance is there that this
country will not follow Robert Mugabe's path to lawlessness and
autocracy?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a very strong Constitution,'' Manuel said, ``and a
very strong, fiercely independent Constitutional Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a Constitution that sets up a number of strong
institutions. And many of those provisions came from the African
National Congress. They weren't foisted on us.''
</P>
<P>
   From the first non-racial election, in 1994, the ANC has
dominated the government. But not long after that election
President Nelson Mandela emphasized the supremacy of the
Constitution and the court that interprets it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 the Constitutional Court held that Mandela had acted
unconstitutionally in making rules for a provincial election
without parliamentary enabling legislation. Mandela, rather than
protesting the decision, said it ``confirms that our new democracy
is taking firm root. This is something of which we should be
proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Will that spirit go on? I asked Manuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have to go on,'' he said. ``We lived in an
environment, under apartheid, in which power was abused. The
Constitution creates a sense of responsibility. We can't walk away
from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process of establishing democracy was an internal
negotiating process, not under the aegis of a colonial power. And
the moving spirit was, `We're all going to have to live here
together.'''
</P>
<P>
   As an example of the institutions created and protected by the
Constitution, Manuel pointed to the Reserve Bank of South Africa.
The Constitution provides that it should act ``independently and
without fear.'' ``Do I disagree sometimes with its monetary
policy?'' Manuel asked. ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   A financial consultant with whom I spoke, Doug Band, had a
similar view of the importance of the rule of law in keeping South
Africa free and stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just been in Europe,'' he said. ``People talked about
Zimbabwe and said it foretold what's going to happen in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``My answer was that we have a very strong Constitution _ and a
democratic disposition. It would be hard to move toward
dictatorship. There's an allegiance to law.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Africa wants to be part of the world. The government
well recognizes that if it doesn't show the world a real commitment
to the rule of law, the game is up.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many indications of public respect for law as the
foundation of the new South Africa. When an ANC official allegedly
charged that racial bias lay behind the conviction of a well-known
figure, Allan Boesak, for corruption, many voices criticized him. A
newspaper with a largely black readership, The Sowetan, said those
critics ``must be supported.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the homelier level _ in terms of crime _ respect for law
has a long way to go. The police, who under apartheid focused on
political repression, remain severely inadequate. Manuel said
changing the police had ``proved to be one of the most difficult
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course South Africa has profound problems. Unemployment is
estimated to be as high as 50 percent. Job creation is an urgent
economic need. Blacks were dispossessed of most of the country's
land; events in Zimbabwe have led to increasing calls from both
blacks and whites for orderly redistribution.
</P>
<P>
   But what is striking to a visitor is the sense of determination
and optimism. Several people in the business community used those
words, among them Bobby Godsell, the CEO of Anglogold.
</P>
<P>
   I interviewed Manuel after he spoke to a high-powered economic
group. The audience cheered when he said, ``The one thing we as
South Africans need is to believe in our souls and our future.''

TRANSPLANTS OF INSULIN-PRODUCING CELLS AID DIABETICS, SCIENTISTS

 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an important advance against diabetes, researchers in Canada
are reporting that transplants of insulin-producing cells have
enabled eight patients with a severe form of the disease to stop
taking insulin injections.
</P>
<P>
   Two to 14 months after being transplanted in a simple procedure
resembling a transfusion, the cells are still working in all eight
patients, half of whom were treated almost a year ago, at the
University of Alberta, in Edmonton. The patients, who had Type 1
diabetes, in which the body produces little or no insulin of its
own, no longer have any symptoms of the disease. Although they no
longer need insulin to control their blood sugar, they now must
take other drugs to prevent rejection of the transplants. So far,
the researchers report that the only side effect from the drugs has
been mild mouth sores, which healed.
</P>
<P>
   The transplanted cells, isolated from the pancreas, were
harvested from deceased organ donors. The goal of the treatment is
to provide an easier and safer alternative to transplanting the
entire pancreas, a major operation that is not commonly done.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something people have wanted for a long time,'' said
Dr. Judith Fradkin, acting director of the division of diabetes,
endocrinology and metabolic diseases at the National Institutes of
Health. Noting that the procedure worked in eight out of eight
patients in whom it was tested, she said, ``If, when it's done in a
larger number of patients, you get anything like that success rate,
it's a quantum leap.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bernard Hering, director of the islet transplant program at
the University of Minnesota, said: ``This shows that cell
transplants can reverse diabetes. Here is something that can really
work and can transform a patient's life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, a non-profit group that
supports research, called the new work ``a very significant step
forward in curing Type 1 diabetes.'' Type 1 is sometimes referred
to as juvenile diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   The diabetes foundation and the health institutes will help pay
for a study to test the new procedure within a few months at eight
transplant centers in North America and Europe. Each center will
treat four patients. The American sites have not yet been named.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have been trying cell transplants for diabetes for
more than 20 years, but most failed or worked only briefly. The
success in eight consecutive patients in Edmonton has been
attributed to several factors, including the use of a new
combination of drugs to prevent rejection, and the transplantation
of many more pancreas cells than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The pancreas cells are transplanted into the patient's liver,
where they lodge in tiny blood vessels and begin doing their normal
work of monitoring and regulating blood glucose levels by secreting
insulin and another hormone, glucagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can now control glucose within a very tight range, as in
a normal individual,'' said Dr. Ray Rajotte, director of the
pancreatic cell research group at Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   To perform the transplant, doctors insert a catheter into the
patient's abdomen and snake it into the portal vein, which carries
blood into the liver. The patient needs only a local anesthetic to
numb the skin. About a teaspoonful of cells are injected through
the catheter, and they spray out and disperse through the liver.
The entire procedure can take as little as 20 minutes. Patients
undergo it twice, with a few weeks between transplants, to get
enough of the insulin-secreting cells.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. A.M. James Shapiro, part of the 44-member Canadian research
team, presented the research last week at medical meetings in
Chicago and Washington. It will be published in the New England
Journal of Medicine, and an editor, Dr. Robert Utiger, said the
study would be posted within about two weeks on the journal's web
site, before it appears in print. The journal's editors reserve
this ``early release'' policy for papers thought to have especially
important implications for the treatment of patients.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The patients in the Canadian study were 29 to 53 years old. All
had severe Type 1 diabetes that was poorly controlled by insulin
shots. About a million Americans have the disease, which usually
develops early in life. Most need several insulin shots a day to
control their blood sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Another 15 million are thought to have Type 2 diabetes, in which
the body may make insulin, but cannot use it properly. Type 2 tends
to come on later in life, and patients may or may not need insulin
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the two forms of diabetes cause nearly 200,000 deaths
a year in the United States, and even with treatment they are a
leading cause of blindness, kidney failure and amputations.
</P>
<P>
   Fradkin said that if the Canadian findings are confirmed by
other studies, cell transplants will be used first for Type 1
patients like those in the study. But eventually, she said, they
might also be given to some Type 2 patients. For now, Shapiro
recommends the procedure only for Type 1 patients with severe and
hard to control symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   If the results are confirmed, it would create an unprecedented
demand for donor organs, Fradkin said, probably far beyond the
supply. The procedure devised in Edmonton requires two donor
pancreases for every patient treated, in order to provide enough of
the insulin-producing cells. It costs $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other research groups, including the University of Minnesota and
the University of Miami, are experimenting with different
techniques that they hope will allow them to use one pancreas per
patient. Still other scientists are trying to find ways to grow
pancreatic cells in culture to provide transplants.
</P>
<P>
   There is great interest in cell transplants because many doctors
feel that transplanting the entire pancreas is too big an operation
to be an acceptable treatment for diabetes, even though the disease
has devastating complications and the surgical success rate matches
that of other organ transplants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tender issue,'' said Dr. Paul Robertson, scientific
director of the Pacific Northwest Research Institute. ``There
generally has not been as much acceptance as there has been of
heart, liver and kidney transplants. Physicians who don't do it say
diabetes is not a life-threatening disease.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude angers some doctors and many patients, but,
nonetheless, pancreas transplants are not often performed, and more
organs are harvested than used. Robertson estimated that worldwide,
doctors do 1,200 transplants a year, perhaps half of them in the
United States. The vast majority are done only in people who also
need kidney transplants because of renal failure brought on by
diabetes. In those cases, many doctors feel the pancreas operation
can be justified because the kidney failure demonstrates that the
diabetes is out of control, and because the patient will already be
on immune-suppressing drugs to prevent rejection of the kidney.
</P>
<P>
   ``But patients say, `Do I have to get kidney failure before I
can get a pancreas?' '' Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest work on cell transplants was published in 1972, by
Dr. Paul Lacey, of Washington University in St. Louis, who showed
in rats that the procedure could cure diabetes. Lacey transplanted
the pancreatic tissue known as islets of Langerhans, which make up
only 3 percent of the pancreas but contain all the
insulin-producing cells, called beta cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thought, this is how we'll cure diabetes,''
Robertson said. But then, when researchers began trying the
procedure in people, it failed most of the time. Occasionally, the
islets would survive and function for a few weeks, sometimes
longer. Doctors could not explain it.
</P>
<P>
   But during the 1990s, they began to suspect that standard
anti-rejection drugs like steroids and cyclosporine might be
damaging the islets, because the islets sat in the liver, where
those drugs become most highly concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were plenty of hints in the medical literature'' that
the drugs needed to be changed, Robertson said. ``But Edmonton gets
the credit. They went ahead and did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of steroids and cyclosporine, the Edmonton team used a
combination of three other anti-rejection drugs, tacrolimus,
sirolimus and daclimuzab. That exact formula will be used in the
study now being planned to replicate the Edmonton study.
</P>
<P>
   But Rajotte said the drugs alone could not account for the
group's success. He said it helped that the patients did not have
kidney failure and therefore were in earlier stage of the disease
than those in other studies. In addition, he said, the new work was
based on 30 years of research on how to isolate healthy
insulin-making cells from the rest of the pancreas.

HARVARD PRESIDENT SAYS HE'LL MISS UNIVERSITY'S `EFFERVESCENCE'
</HEADLINE>
  By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE , Mass. _ Neil L. Rudenstine doesn't even look tired.
</P>
<P>
   The last that many heard from Rudenstine, the 26th president of
Harvard University, was in 1994, when he slept through a series of
public appointments and abruptly took a three-month leave for what
he called, simply, exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   He returned, tanned, from a beach vacation and since then has
completed the largest fund-raising campaign in the history of
higher education, turned Radcliffe College into an Institute for
Advanced Study with a $300 million endowment and celebrated the
30th anniversary of Harvard's Afro-American studies department with
the dream team of black scholars he helped assemble during his nine
years there.
</P>
<P>
   He has done most of it quietly, rarely seizing the stage
afforded the head of the nation's oldest and most storied
university. This week, without so much as a news conference,
Rudenstine, 65, sent word that he would retire after next year's
commencement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is exhilarating _ the amount of total firepower it
has,'' Rudenstine said of Harvard, with its 364-year history and
its 18,000 students and 2,000 professors. ``It's hard to get
through a week without having some kind of a discussion that
doesn't really set you off thinking or reading.''
</P>
<P>
   Pondering his future, Rudenstine said he would miss the
``effervescence'' of the campus, sighing, ``It's awfully hard to
find that in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   That, and a new place to live. Rudenstine and his wife,
Angelica, an art historian and curator, long ago sold their home in
Princeton, N.J., and have been storing their books and etchings in
the three-story Colonial, built in 1767, where Harvard's president
has lived since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Sipping Perrier in the house's library, with its
floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and sea-foam-green paint, Rudenstine
stared into space as he reflected on his time as president, once
rising to move his gaze out the window to the expansive lawn. A
scholar of 16th-century poetry, he could not select a verse, on the
spot, to sum up the experience, but said he had lately been leafing
through works that were more contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seemed very important to be in touch with this century
and what's going on,'' he said. ``Whatever roads of access I could
find, I chose.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Ossining, N.Y., the son of a Russian Jewish immigrant
and a first-generation Italian-American Catholic, Rudenstine
started his education at a one-room schoolhouse in rural
Connecticut, then climbed the ivory tower, earning degrees at
Princeton, Harvard and Oxford. After a dissertation on Sir Philip
Sidney, a 16th-century poet, he taught English briefly at Harvard
but spent most of his career as an administrator at Princeton. He
is only the sixth president of Harvard appointed since the Civil
War and, having arrived in 1991, will have had the shortest tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of his predecessors, Rudenstine did not establish
himself as a kind of public intellectual, holding sway on the
issues of the day. He testified before Congress in support of
government financing of scientific research, and, in academic
circles, was a leading supporter of affirmative action, but never
penetrated to the public at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``My voice and voices like it haven't been paid much attention
to,'' he lamented. ``I think I assumed, given the welter of voices,
it probably wasn't going to be picked up. It's not easy to have
your voice picked up these days.'' In 1957, he noted, the president
of Princeton was on the cover of Time magazine; ``you can't even
conceive of that happening today.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Rudenstine, like his colleagues at universities
around the country, spent much of his time raising money. And he
was awfully good at it, averaging more than $1 million a day for
six years, a pace that allowed him to shatter a staggering $2.1
billion campaign goal by $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if it's some kind of extra skill that you have to
develop,'' he said with a shrug. ``It fundamentally is an extension
of the extent to which you have ideals and goals you're persuaded
by. If you believe enough in those things, it resonates with
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The modern university president often seems more chief executive
than scholar, a paradigm Rudenstine rejects. While elsewhere the
job has been restructured ``so as to take people further and
further away from the things that connect you to the academic heart
of the institution,'' he said, Harvard demands that its president
stay engaged, by requiring him to oversee all tenure decisions
personally. ( Rudenstine has handled more than 250.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You come away with a constant probing of where things are
going and why they're going that way,'' he said. ``If you're not
recapitalizing your intellectual capital, you're not going to know
enough to lead anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to know what to do next, what could possibly match
the prestige _ or the perks _ of a post that included trips to East
Africa, Latin America, France, Germany, England and, twice, China.
There was that astonishing meeting of Shanghai's Harvard Club that
silently spoke the geopolitical story of a century _ a room full of
elderly men who had graduated before World War II, another room of
young entrepreneurs with degrees from the 1980's and 1990's.
</P>
<P>
   He will undoubtedly get more rest, though ever since that very
high-profile collapse, he has been diligent about down time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't book yourselves a real vacation around here, six
months in advance, you just don't get it,'' he said. Now, the
Rudenstines take a week in January, two or three weeks in the
summer and lots of long weekends.

FALL INTO NETWORK LINEUP
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Next fall, there will be no need for cable networks like Nick at
Nite and TV Land _ the networks have thoughtfully repackaged all
your nostalgic favorites for you, in tidy, refurbished packages
with shiny new ribbons.
</P>
<P>
   Everything new is old, again, as the networks mine series ideas
past and present to tinker together the freshman series on their
fall schedules. For example: ``Tucker'' is a teen ``Malcolm in the
Middle.'' ``Gideon's Crossing'' transposes the righteous
speechifying from ``The West Wing'' into a dedicated, caring
``Marcus Welby, M.D.'' with a dash no doubt of ``ER.''
``Girlfriends'' is ``Sex and the City.`` So is ``The $treet,'' with
an unholy combination of ``Dallas'' and ``Melrose Place'' thrown in
for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't Ask'' is ``Will &AMP; Grace'' meets ``Daddio.'' ``Geena'' is
``Sara'' in ``Something So Right.'' ``The Bette Show'' is ``The
Larry Sanders Show'' meets ``Cybill.'' ``Night Visions'' revisits
``The Twilight Zone,'' while ``Boston Public'' harkens back to
``Room 222.'' ``Deadline'' is a crime-fighting ``Lou Grant,'' or
``Kolchak: The Night Stalker'' minus the zombies and werewolves.
``The Fugitive'' is, um, ``The Fugitive.''
</P>
<P>
   We could go on, but we've gone three paragraphs in a story about
TV without mentioning ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and could
be sued for malpractice. Here's another thing we can attribute to
Regis Philbin's quizzery: The networks have momentarily ceased
wringing their hands over audiences lost to cable and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's still happening: Scratch Regis from the schedule
and the network hemorrhage continues. We don't really have any
shows anymore that can be discussed around a water-cooler at a
company with even mildly diverse employees, except you know what.
(Herewith, a promise to dispense with all the lifeline and hot seat
and final answer puns.)
</P>
<P>
   And so, the boggling success of something as retro as a game
show apparently forced the networks into a re-evaluation of its
goals: Maybe what's needed isn't something as confrontationally
cutting-edge as ``Action'' or ``Wonderland'' or as recherche as
``Freaks and Geeks,'' which were canceled lastseason. Maybe
audiences are just hungry for the same old same old.
</P>
<P>
   Even Fox, which is famous for taking adventurous leaps with edgy
programs, has an uncharacteristically bland schedule. An NBC
executive even anonymously admitted to the New York Times that the
network's new programming _ tagline, ``The Quality Shows'' _ is
lousy. So the best we can do is be grateful that the summer
Olympics will delay the fall season until October, whereupon the
World Series will divert our attention away from it until November,
at which point sweeps stunts will take up our time through December
and that holiday programming will interrupt shows into January.
When most of the worst stuff will have already been cancelled.
</P>
<P>
   So before the body is cold, let's autopsy next season:
</P>
<P>
   Diversity: Last year's hot-button topic confronting the networks
was the shocking dearth of minority characters on virtually all of
the white-bread series (very few of those series survived,
incidentally). Many of the new series include minority supporting
characters, particularly African-Americans and Asian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Four feature African-Americans in lead roles: ABC's ``Gideon's
Crossing'' stars Emmy winner Andre Braugher as a passionate doctor;
CBS's ``The Fugitive'' stars Mykelti Williamson as the Fed tracking
down accused murderer Tim Daly; David Alan Grier stars as a Secret
Service agent in NBC's comedy ``DAG,'' and UPN offers an ensemble
comedy entitled ``Girlfriends.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Latinos remain woefully invisible (CBS
rejected a Latino series from award-winning filmmaker Gregory
Nava). Latino viewers will have to subscribe to Showtime in order
to see their lives depicted: ``Resurrection Blvd.'' debuts next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Stars who can't open a movie: Outside of Lisa Kudrow, none of
the ``Friends'' has a particularly promising film career ahead of
them (well, maybe Jennifer Aniston, if she starts exhibiting some
taste in the projects she selects). So what did NBC think it was
buying when it ponied up that $750,000 per episode for the likes of
David Schwimmer and Matt LeBlanc? As for Bette Midler, the reported
$250,000 checks she'll be cashing for each episode of CBS's ``The
Bette Show'' may after a single season amount to more than the
grosses for her last two films, ``Isn't She Great'' and ``Drowning
Mona.''
</P>
<P>
   Oscar winner Geena Davis spent too much of the '90s starring in
lame, money-pit action flicks directed by her ex-husband Renny
Harlin and recently played second-fiddle to a cartoon mouse, which
may explain her willingness to star in an ABC sitcom. Charlie
Sheen's action flicks devolved to the direct-to-video stage, so he
jumped to Michael J. Fox's ``Spin City.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite dash and elan, Gabriel Byrne hasn't quite become a
marquee star, so he had a hand in developing the ABC sitcom ``The
Madigan Men.'' And Oliver Platt enlivens any movie he's in, but
doesn't seem to be leading man material, so his move to starring as
an investigative journalist in NBC's ``Deadline'' is simply film's
loss.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers:! Never in danger of being underrepresented on
television, the Big Apple is home for at least seven new series
(and !ital!still no Latino characters!). NBC offers up ``Deadline''
and ``The Steven Weber Show'' (starring the ``Wings'' actor as a
man whose life is cursed by a vengeful blind date). CBS brings an
Indiana weatherman in to gawk at skyscrapers on ``Welcome to New
York'' (the show is executive-produced by former Indiana weatherman
David Letterman). ABC's sitcoms ``Geena,'' ``Madigan Men,'' and the
paranoid ``People Who Fear People'' all take place there, while the
street in question in Fox's soapy ``The $treet'' is Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Families: ``Malcolm in the Middle'' and ``Daddio'' proved what
``Everybody Loves Raymond'' already knew _ that there was life left
in the family sitcom _ and ``Titus'' proved that those families
could be very strange indeed. Hence, CBS's ``Yes, Dear,'' starring
Anthony Clarke as a bumbling father; NBC's ``Tucker,'' a bald
``Malcolm'' ripoff, and Fox's ``Don't Ask,'' featuring John Goodman
as a gay father. Gabriel Byrne must contend with a teenage son and
an eccentric father in ``Madigan Men.'' ``Schimmel,'' starring
standup comic Robert Schimmel as a long-suffering father, may show
up _ it was yanked from the schedule almost as soon as it was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   In direct contrast to last season, there are virtually no new
series focusing on teens. Last year, everyone tried to emulate the
WB's young-and-cute formula for success (even the WB), and nobody
(not even the WB) had any luck with it. On the other hand, adult
generational dramas like ``Judging Amy'' and ``Providence''
strengthened their audience bases. Hence, more adult drama. Even
the WB is skewing older _ just a smidgen _ with ``Gilmore Girls,''
a family story about a young mother and her teen daughter. CBS is
offering the generational dramedy ``That's Life,'' about a Jersey
thirtysomething who returns to college.
</P>
<P>
   The paranormal: ``The X-Files'' has spawned many imitators but
no successes _ NBC recently just scrapped its entire Saturday night
``thrillogy'' _ but that doesn't mean people won't keep trying. Fox
is still insistently dipping into that well, with ``Dark Angel,''
from filmmaker James Cameron, ``Night Visions,'' a Serlingesque
anthology series, ``Fearsum,'' from one of ``The Blair Witch
Project's'' producers, and ``The Lone Gunmen,'' the nerdy,
conspiracy-minded ``X-Files''spinoff. NBC has a midseason
replacement, ``News from the Edge,'' which posits that everything
you read about aliens and bat-boys in the supermarket tabloids is
true.
</P>
<P>
   And now, projected winners on a night-by-night basis:
</P>
<P>
   Sunday: By default, ``Ed'' on NBC. Rob Burnett, head writer on
``Late Show with David Letterman,'' created this oddball dramedy,
about a lawyer returning to his hometown and buying a bowling
alley, that's more ``Northern Exposure'' than ``Providence,'' set
in the surreally normal Midwest. This probably isn't the best place
on the schedule for the show, since ``The Simpsons''and ``Malcolm''
could usurp its likely audience, but it at least has a better
chance than a WB sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   Monday: CBS's ``Yes, Dear'' has a cushy spot on the schedule _
between ``King of Queens'' and ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' _ that
even won the weak ``Ladies Man'' an OK audience last season. It's a
more conventional family comedy in the manner of its surrounding
programming, so if this is any better _ and its clips had a couple
of laughs, more than ``Ladies Man'' ever mustered _ then it should
fare well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston Public'' comes mere months after David E. Kelley _ who
still has ``Ally McBeal''and ``The Practice''on the air _ conceded
the dangers of spreading himself too thin. And with the perception
that ``Ally's''appeal is, well, thinning, ``Boston Public'' _ its
pilot hasn't even been shot yet _ may not have enough sizzle to
draw viewers. But the time seems right for a show set in a school
that focuses on the adults, not the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Wolf's ``Deadline'' stars Oliver Platt as a crusading,
crime-fighting journalist. It's in pricey real estate (opposite
football, ``Raymond'' and ``Ally``), but Wolf's ``Law &AMP; Order:
Special Victims Unit'' survived the slot last year and was moved to
Fridays, where it thrived. (Wolf's enlisting real-life reporters to
make cameo appearances on the show, so clearly, he's not aiming for
telegenic faces as he did with the WB's ``D.C.'')
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday: James Cameron's high-tech thriller ``Dark Angel''
should help Fox immeasurably, even if it tries too hard to cram
lots of backstory and mythology into its early shows. More to the
point, it should chip away at the WB's celebrated Tuesday pairing
of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer''and ``Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday: CBS's ``The Bette Show'' has emerged as the most
highly anticipated series of the upcoming season, as everyone seems
anxious to watch Bette Midler send up her persona on a weekly
basis. The question, though, is once you get past the jokes about
her not winning an Oscar for ``The Rose'' and the fact that much of
her fan base is gay and that she isn't svelte _ all covered in the
introductory five-minute clip from the pilot _ how many
Bette-specific jokes can you tell every week?
</P>
<P>
   ``Gideon's Crossing'' on ABC offers Andre Braugher as a
compassionate yet commanding physician. It's filled with those sort
of stirring, if-we-don't-help-our-fellow-man-who-will? monologues
that brings 'em to their feet over at ``The West Wing.'' Trouble
is, it's on opposite ``Law &AMP; Order,'' one of TV's few sure bets
these days.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday: Lauren Graham's NBC sitcom ``M.Y.O.B.'' hasn't even
debuted yet in order to get cancelled, and she's already receiving
kudos for her upcoming WB series, ``Gilmore Girls,'' about a young
mother and her teen daughter running a bed-and-breakfast. It's on
opposite ``Friends,'' but ``Popular'' was able to carve out a niche
audience in that timeslot last year.
</P>
<P>
   Friday: CBS has a couple of promising shows, with the no-brainer
remake of ``The Fugitive'' and the Jerry Bruckheimer-produced
``C.S.I.'' about forensic investigators in Las Vegas. But as
successful as these shows should be on Fridays, they'd be that much
stronger elsewhere on the network's schedule. ``C.S.I.,'' on the
other hand, might attract the same viewers staying home to watch
NBC's cop procedural ``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday: With the other networks abnegating Saturday nights -
ABC and NBC will run movies _ it's CBS's night to lose. ``The
District'' looks like good, old-fashioned programming for Saturday
night cocooners, with a proven star (Craig T. Nelson of ``Coach'')
and premise (a top cop cleans up crime in a troubled city _
Washington, D.C., to be precise).
</P>
<P>
   As for the losers, there's really only one:
</P>
<P>
   People who don't like ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire:'' It's on
all over ABC's schedule, and something you do enjoy will probably
be scheduled opposite it, meaning a likely quick cancellation.
Sorry.
</P>

CLEVELAND PARK JOURNAL: A MEDIA SHOW COMES HOME TO ROOST 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM WEINER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Proving once again that God has a sense of humor,
Elian Gonzalez has moved to the most media-centric neighborhood on
earth.
</P>
<P>
   The beast that has stalked the 6-year-old Cuban boy since his
shipwreck in November _ the tall-masted television trucks and their
cargoes of stand-up news personalities, the federal marshals with
their yellow barricade tape _ now lives in an estate on Newark
Street in Washington's Cleveland Park.
</P>
<P>
   It and all it represents have brought, shall we say, concern to
the leafy glade, home to an extraordinary concentration of
prominent Washington editors, publishers, political figures and
power brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neighbors are scared of the media frenzy that they had in
Miami,'' said Derry Craig, who lives around the corner from the
estate owned by the youth foundation, Youth for Understanding
International Exchange. Her husband, Gregory Craig, President
Clinton's lawyer during the late unpleasantness of impeachment, and
thus no stranger to such frenzies, brought his clients, Elian and
his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to Newark Street late Thursday
night to begin their latest experience of America.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not Little Havana. In fact, ``this is not America,''
said Debby Weil, 48, a dot-com marketing manager who lives on
Newark Street. ``It's an incredibly privileged, upper-percentile
place,'' _ replete with Volvo station wagons, private schools and
golden retrievers.
</P>
<P>
   The street is the heart of Cleveland Park, not Washington's
richest or most exclusive neighborhood but home to more than a few
media chieftains: Donald Graham, the publisher of The Washington
Post; Jim Lehrer, the public television news anchor; David
Ignatius, the next editor of The International Herald Tribune;
Michael Oreskes, Washington bureau chief of The New York Times;
Judy Woodruff of CNN and her husband, Al Hunt of The Wall Street
Journal, to name a few, are now Elian's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Because the neighborhood is such a media-rich environment,
``there is mild amusement that the chickens have come home to
roost,'' Weil said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez and his son now live at the Rosedale estate, a 1793
dwelling surrounded by a greensward that was, until Friday, the
neighborhood's public dog run.
</P>
<P>
   ``That beautiful lawn was where we all walk our dogs,'' Weil
said. ``The first thought was: can we still walk our dogs?'' Yes,
but only on a narrow strip between the yellow tape and the street,
and only on a leash. So there was a muted howling at the dog run
Fraiday morning, and it was not coming from the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Directly across Newark Street from the Rosedale estate stands
the home of a 47-year-old conservative pundit who frequently writes
for the New Yorker and requested, no, insisted, on anonymity. He
finds the arrival of the Elian entourage in his neighborhood _
where he says ``Dukakis for President'' bumper stickers still cling
to those Volvos _ beyond satire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment it was announced _ `Guess who's coming to dinner!'
_ all these Janet Reno devotees, who a month ago were saying, `Good
for Janet for getting him out,' are now singing a far different
aria,'' he said. ``Now that their little darling is in their
backyards, the cry has gone up _ `What about the dogs?'''
</P>
<P>
   A cynic (or a novelist) might foresee a turn in the
neighborhood's perception of the Elian saga, he said, now that
``the billion-footed centipede is leaving droppings on their
lawns.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward Just, a novelist who has chronicled the political culture
of Washington since the 1960s, foresaw exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I predict,'' Just said, tongue deeply imbedded in cheek,
``many op-ed articles about the intrusiveness of the press, some
written by newspapermen. There's going to be a lot of new interest
in normalizing relations with Cuba. And if all else fails, they'll
call for Reno's resignation.''

FINANCIAL COMMENTARY: TRADING MORE NOW FOR LESS LATER 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., May 28) 
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because it is so contentious, the debate over reforming Social
Security draws plenty of attention. So it is easy to overlook that
Congress has just reformed Social Security _ enacting a change that
should have been contentious but somehow wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, people in their late 60s have the choice of
collecting a full pension while also earning handsome pay. That is
dangerous. What America's senior citizens decide to do with this
choice will affect their level of income _ or poverty _ in deep old
age. Because of the way the new law plays to human nature, many
might make the wrong choice. Some already have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waiting to collect benefits is basically betting that you will
live beyond the average life expectancy,'' said Peter Orszag, an
economist and Social Security expert at the University of
California at Berkeley. That average for people who are already 65
is 81 for men and 84 for women, and rising for both. ``When you
give people in their late 60s the choice of collecting their Social
Security benefits now, then you raise the odds of their being poor
in real old age.''
</P>
<P>
   The mechanics are simple enough. Previously, people between 65
and 70 who earned more than $17,000 a year had their Social
Security pension benefits reduced, and those who earned more than
$50,000 a year had them postponed entirely, until they turned 70 or
stopped earning so much. As a quid pro quo, the monthly pension
checks they ultimately received were higher the longer after 65
they had to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the first time, people in their late 60s can earn any
amount and still draw full pensions. But the old quid pro quo
survives: people can still voluntarily wait until 70 to get larger
checks thereafter. Those who take their pensions at 65 get a head
start in total benefits paid, but those who wait will overtake them
in their 80s, and the longer they live, the wider the gap grows.
</P>
<P>
   The monthly payment at 70, for example, would be $1,300 for
someone who passed up $1,000 at 65.
</P>
<P>
   Congress had been moving gradually in this direction, but the
new legislation, signed by President Clinton April 7, completed the
process in one leap.
</P>
<P>
   But that is politics. The real issues are work incentives and
adequate income in very old age, particularly the latter. It is
still possible to voluntarily hold off collecting pension benefits
until age 70, but hardly anyone has chosen to do so. Of 419,000
registered wage earners in their late 60s who were collecting
either reduced benefits or none at all when the new law took effect
in April, only 800 are still holding off until age 70.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean the others have all actively chosen not to
wait; many were probably swept passively onto the benefit rolls. To
minimize its clerical work, the Social Security Administration sent
out letters announcing that all 419,000 would receive full benefits
automatically, unless they called a toll-free number and
specifically opted to wait. Getting through on the often-busy phone
line was not easy.
</P>
<P>
   People who wanted to wait could also have sent back their first
checks. But in defiance of a main tenet of mainstream economics,
that people make rational decisions in their best interest, hardly
anyone returned the checks. ``People in their 60s in good health
whose parents lived long lives should rationally choose to defer,''
said Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
``But there is a tendency to want your money now.'' Particularly
when it is in hand and substantial; the first checks averaged
$3,500, retroactively covering the first four months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   There is a second irrational tendency among people drawing both
paychecks and benefit checks: to spend it all rather than save for
future retirement, increasing the odds of poverty later. But
Congress gave in to an irrational outcry from working people in
their late 60s who complained with growing frequency that
withholding benefits was an unjust ``tax'' on work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real misperception out there that when the money is
withheld it is gone; they will never see it again,'' said Kenneth
Apfel, commissioner of Social Security. ``The number of seniors who
perceive this is not insignificant.''
</P>
<P>
   So Congress acted. The budget and Social Security surpluses
helped to make the action politically palatable.
</P>
<P>
   So did another misperception: that in a robust economy suffering
labor shortages, removing the earnings limits would encourage
senior citizens to work a lot more. The most optimistic studies
fail to support this contention. Hours worked will rise 4 or 5
percent at most, or roughly the equivalent of 50,000 full-time
workers a year. That is what today's strong economy absorbs in a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there is a lesson here for judging the Gore and Bush
proposals for Social Security reform: Look for the misperceptions.

THE WATCHDOG 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   To understand why the government's case against Microsoft came
to its abrupt climax last week in the courtroom of US District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, it helps to know something about how
the security technology from the computer network at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology ended up at the heart of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Kerberos is hardly a household word, even now. It surfaced
repeatedly in the declarations of the experts whom the government
intended to present as testimony in the remedy phase of the trial.
It was among the centerpieces of the friend-of-the-court narrative
submitted by an industry association that Jackson praised as ``an
excellent brief, excellent brief.''
</P>
<P>
   In Greek myth, Kerberos (often transliterated Cerberus) was the
three-headed watchdog who guarded the gate to Hades. It is as good
a symbol as any of the tactics that have brought Microsoft to the
brink of break-up.
</P>
<P>
   The story starts back in the 1980s, when personal computers
first began to connect with older mainframes and mini-computers in
extensive networks within universities. MIT is famous for hijinks _
including the sort of computer break-ins which have subsequently
come to be known as exercises in ``hacking.'' Yet to this day no
MIT computer has ever been seriously hacked.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because a venture led by network manager Jeffrey I.
Schiller as part of Project Athena _ an early partnership between
MIT, Digital Equipment and IBM to wire the university campus _
developed an ingenious technique to prevent passwords from being
stolen even by the most ingenious interceptor program. The details
are not important here.
</P>
<P>
   What is important is that the system was virtually foolproof. By
1995, when Victoria Richardson described it in The Financial Times,
she wrote that the ``impressive track record is attracting the
attention of growing numbers of companies, whose executives trek
through MIT's visitor center almost daily to see how the protocols
work.''
</P>
<P>
   In due course Kerberos was made an open, extensible standard of
the Internet Engineering Task Force. Like the rest of the protocols
and standards that made the Internet such a smash-hit technology,
it was freely available to anyone who wanted to incorporate its
techniques in a design, modifiable in any direction that a designer
felt might make it better _ a perfect example of
collaboratively-developed ``open source'' software.
</P>
<P>
   There was just one problem. In a paricular field of the Kerberos
program, which had been left open for some unforeseen future use,
Microsoft inserted some clever and indecipherable code of its own,
designed to affect its interface with other software, which it then
kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   Presto! Microsoft had transformed Kerberos from open-standard
Internet computing into a proprietary domain.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rebecca M. Henderson, a professor at MIT's Sloan
School of Management who is one of the government's prospective
experts, Microsoft's choices ``do not admit of a potentially benign
interpretation.'' No non-Microsoft server can use the security
features of Microsoft's Windows operating system, she noted.
Windows 2000 PCs cannot log into a Unix Kerberos server and expect
them to file or print.
</P>
<P>
   That means that anyone with a website had better run Windows
2000 on their server if they want to connect with the rest of the
world, whose desktops are hugely dominated by Windows operating
systems. Sun, Novell, Apache and the rest of the Unix-based world,
say good-bye to the market for servers.
</P>
<P>
   This is the ``applications barrier to entry,'' whose abuse is
the chief complaint of the government suit. What is not widely
appreciated is how vulnerable to capture is the whole great open
system of the Internet if the abuse continues. The proprietary
extensions of Kerberos are only one example. Ahead lie directory
services and streaming video software _ both already tied to
Windows 2000. The evidence in the trial showed that Microsoft is
working to co-opt many other standards, not the least HTML, the
language that permitted the World Wide Web to unfold so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The government charges that the PC operating system provides a
chokehold that Microsoft has systematically exploited to convert
open-standard computing _ the Netscape browser is the chief example
_ to its own domain. ``The ocean of innovation on the Internet
becomes a stagnant Microsoft-proprietary pond,'' as the joint
remedy brief of the Computer and Communications Industry
Association and the Software and Information Industry Association
put it last week.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Jackson's swift decision to end the Microsoft trial last
week effectively closed the case. Once he makes a decision on what
remedy to order, his findings will probably go to the Supreme
Court. It may come back down for further hearing. It may be carried
over into an administration headed by George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are that a newly-elected Bush wouldn't get involved in a
case in which the evidence against Microsoft is simply
overwhelming. But even if the Justice Department suddenly went
limp, the states who are joint parties to the suit could switch
roles and carry on. It now is highly likely that the company will
be broken up.
</P>
<P>
   This much is clear. In preferring the competition that would be
engendered by the breakup over regulation, the judge is determined
to avoid the protracted oversight of swiftly-changing technology
that was the bitter fate of Judge Harold Greene in the wake of
divestiture of AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities to that case are growing stronger all the time.
So remember that 100 shares of Ma Bell worth $6,150 at the time of
the break-up were worth $56,144 in the middle of 1999.

BRITISH ENTREPRENEUR PLANS MAMMOTH INTERNET CAFE IN TIMES SQUARE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It is an unlikely export from here, but come this fall,
a Britain-based entrepreneur will be taking his successful chain of
Internet cafes across the Atlantic to Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   The company, called EasyEverything, has created the equivalent
of cybercafes on steroids _ the one being planned for Times Square
will have 650 to 1,000 Internet terminals with high-resolution,
flat-panel screens.
</P>
<P>
   Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the founder of EasyEverything and the
5-year-old low-cost European airline, EasyJet, signed a lease this
week for a 13,300-square-foot site at 8 Times Square on 42nd Street
between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. EasyEverything is part of the
same development where the new Hilton Hotel is being completed,
along with another British export, Madame Tussaud's, the wax
museum.
</P>
<P>
   If EasyEverything has even a smidgen of the success it has had
here, queues _ er, lines _ will begin to form around the
super-cybercafe before it even opens. The first EasyEverything,
which opened June 21, 1999, near Victoria Station here with 400
computer terminals, was greeted by so many Internet surfers on its
first day that the staff handed out coffee to the hordes that
gathered offline to keep them from leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Internet cafes have never really taken off in the United States
the way they have here and throughout other parts of Europe, so it
may be somewhat of a surprise if Haji-Ioannou succeeds. Even he
concedes it may be a struggle, though one he expects to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have said that I'll never make it work in New
York,'' he said. ``But they said that about London, too. Have you
ever been to EasyEverything in London at 2 a.m.? It's packed.''
</P>
<P>
   The cafes themselves look futuristic, like a set from ``Star
Trek,'' with hundreds of people at rows of computers. They sell
coffee, snacks and sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons EasyEverything, which is open 24 hours per
day, may have succeeded in London are that most people here do not
own personal computers and that the telephone rates for dial-up
modem access to the Internet is significantly higher than in the
United States. Because local telephone calls are billed by the
minute here _ not a flat rate like American telephone companies
offer _ Internet users must pay the telephone company and the
Internet access providers, like America Online, every time they log
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``By itself, it is deadly dull for a U.S. audience,'' said Bruce
Kasrel, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, which analyzes
e-commerce. ``People already have Internet access at the office and
at home.'' He cited empty Internet access terminals at airports as
an example of a similar scheme that had not worked.
</P>
<P>
   One reason New Yorkers might log on is simply the sense of
privacy. ``I know a lot of people come in to go online to search
for jobs so their employer doesn't know,'' said Haji-Ioannou. He
also expects tourists to pop in to check their e-mail. ``Mobile
Internet access doesn't work and isn't cheap,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Haji-Ioannou has always prided himself on offering customers
things cheap. His low-cost airline EasyJet, which has many of the
qualities of Southwest Airlines, offers tickets sometimes for a
third of the cost of the same flights on British Airways. At
EasyEverything, the pricing scheme is truly laissez-faire. The
price fluctuates depending on how many people are using the
computers, but the price usually hovers around $1.50 for an hour of
surfing. ``We'll charge whatever it takes'' to fill the (cafe),''
Haji-Ioannou said.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Square cafe is set to open in September or early
October.
</P>
<P>
   Besides London, where there are now six super-cybercafes with a
total of 2,800 terminals, Haji-Ioannou also opened one in Edinburgh
last week, with others on the way in Amsterdam and Rotterdam in the
Netherlands and in Barcelona, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kasrel is not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason Regis Philbin hosts `Who Wants to be a
Millionaire' in the States,'' he said, referring to the British
program that was successfully exported. ``We have different
tastes.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Memorial Day heralds the coming of the summer
slowdown, giving promise to the longer, warmer days. Vacation. The
beach. Fourth of July picnics. And, as a friend of mine on the East
Coast said, ``Things finally begin to slow down enough to actually
leave the office early on a Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   We on the West Coast smile to ourselves at that last statement.
We have a secret, hidden behind the Sierra Madres and buried
beneath the San Andreas Fault. We don't wait for summer to taste
the fruit of the four-and-a-half-day workweek.
</P>
<P>
   I encountered this phenomenon while a staff person for a member
of Congress in San Francisco. I found it difficult to schedule
meetings on Friday afternoons, or to get phone calls returned once
placed on Friday mornings. People were ``unavailable'' or ``already
booked'' or, more plaintively, asking, ``Can't you find another
time?''
</P>
<P>
   This, I soon learned, is code for ``I'm at the beach'' or ``my
flight to Vegas is nonrefundable'' or ``it's the only time I have
with my masseuse.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to pin down why. Recent statistics show that only
one in three Californians hold a regular 9-to-5 job. Perhaps
telecommuting, dot-commers and commutes that can stretch for hours
render the hold of the traditional workweek increasingly
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   The time difference can be another reason. For those who deal
with the East Coast, 5 p.m. is only 2 p.m. here _ plenty of time to
get a jump-start on the weekend. And if the East Coast leaves, say,
by noon, what incentive is there for us to even get up for work?
</P>
<P>
   But it's more than that. Look at a baseball game. Whenever I
watch a televised game at Yankee Stadium on a work night, I see
hundreds _ perhaps thousands _ of people still in their business
suits.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the only people in business attire are serving
the beer. While fans in midtown are working to the last minute and
fighting their way onto the subway to the Bronx, the fans in
California have changed clothes and, while sipping wine, are
debating whether the Thai sausage on the grill is really more
flavorful than a robust andouille.
</P>
<P>
   I write this piece not to insinuate that East Coasters are
worker drones chained to their desks except during the summer lull,
nor to imply that Californians are play-oriented irresolutes who
escape responsibility as soon as any Friday rolls around. We work
as hard as our East Coast brethren. Maybe we just look better doing
it.
</P>
<P>
   That same Banana Republic-clad fan nibbling on sushi is checking
voice and e-mail, returning calls. When my city's new baseball
stadium opened last month, fans marveled at its ``old time'' feel.
</P>
<P>
   But the warm feelings quickly turned to frustration for many
business people who discovered that the structure of the ballpark
rendered their cell phones impotent.
</P>
<P>
   Don't blame us because we live surrounded by the temptations of
paradise. Pity us because we are tied by electronic umbilical cords
to employers, customers, clients and investors who are with us even
when we're putting for birdie at Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   I exaggerate when I say that we cut every Friday short.
</P>
<P>
   But given the opportunity or excuse, Californians will, no
matter the season, jump in their cars, crank the stereo and head
for hill, valley or beach on overcrowded freeways that force us to
get on the road earlier and earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Even elected officials like myself, whose weekends are
chock-a-block with scheduled events both day and night, are not
immune to the siren's call. Sometimes, on the rare late Friday
afternoon, you might hear an unfamiliar sound in the background of
my cell phone. I'll leave it up to your imagination, but here's a
hint: ``Fore!''

APOLOGIES TO THE IROQUOIS ARE NOT ENOUGH

   LAWRENCE, Kan. _ Across upstate New York, Indians from the six
nations of the Haudenosaunee, or Iroquois, are becoming impatient
with the slow resolution of claims for return of land taken from us
illegally after 1790. A claim by the Oneidas for 900 acres near
Oneida Lake is finally heading to trial, but Seneca and Mohawk
cases are crawling through the legal system, and an Onondaga claim
is expected this year.
</P>
<P>
   All the Iroquois hope this story won't be $24 worth of beads
Part II. But if one case that has actually gone to trial is an
indication, we can hardly count on it.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a federal jury awarded the Cayugas, another Iroquois
nation, just $36.9 million for 64,000 acres of land. The Cayugas
had claimed a loss of $2 billion. The United States, suing on their
behalf, had estimated their claim at $335 million. But the jury
awarded even less than the $51.9 million offered by the state in
settlement negotiations, confirming the bitterness of those who
call it impossible for indigenous people to get justice in
America's courts.
</P>
<P>
   The case is not over. A second phase of the trial begins in
July, and there are ample grounds for modification of the award.
But the results so far are discouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the Cayugas numbered about 1,000 and lived in the
Finger Lakes area of central New York. On the land they claim,
about 10,000 people, mostly white, now live in small towns and on
farms.
</P>
<P>
   After the Revolutionary War, the new state of New York, seeking
land to give to men who had fought against the British, coerced the
Iroquois into signing treaties intended to extinguish our land
titles. But those treaties were in violation of federal law.
</P>
<P>
   In 1790, Congress had passed the Nonintercourse Act, prohibiting
and invalidating all Indian land transactions not made under the
authority of the federal government. New York ignored the law and
took millions of acres with no federal oversight. Some Iroquois
retained small reservations, but the Cayugas were coerced into
selling all their land, for as little as $1.50 per acre. They
scattered, hoping someday they might return.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, the Supreme Court ruled that the Oneidas could sue for
violations of the Nonintercourse Act. In 1980, the Cayugas,
building on this precedent, filed their suit, and in 1989, a
federal court said they had a valid claim. The remaining question
was the appropriate remedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Cayugas sought not only damages, but the return of their
land and the removal of all trespassers. But thousands of those
living in the claim area mobilized to oppose the establishment of
any new Cayuga homeland, and last summer the court ruled that
removal of trespassers was not an ``equitable'' remedy.
</P>
<P>
   The theory of justice embraced thus far by federal, state and
local officials is that the Cayugas should be paid some amount of
money with which they can try to buy their own land back from
people who do not want them to have any of it.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine another issue that forces Americans to
confront their sinful past quite like an Indian land claim. The
trespassing non-Indians protest that it was not they, but the
state, 200 years ago, that caused this problem. They are
technically right. But they are still residing on someone else's
land.
</P>
<P>
   After two centuries of aggression that led to the near-demise of
the Cayugas as a people, justice requires more than handing them a
check and wishing them luck. It requires that the wrongdoer, the
state, give them back enough land and enough of a financial
settlement to allow them to rebuild their nation.
</P>
<P>
   As in Northern Ireland, leaders on both sides need to emerge to
build peace plans. But before that can happen, New York and federal
officials must find the political courage to tell the whites living
on Indian land that the original owners continue to have a valid
legal right to it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   There was surprisingly little shock when the General Accounting
Office revealed this week that investigators with forged badges
were able to gain entry into what are supposedly some of the most
secure of federal agencies. It was, after all, only the latest in a
series of similarly alarming stories about security lapses in the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The holders of the phony badges were intentionally testing
security at doorways of the Justice Department, Pentagon, CIA, FBI
and State Department. Earlier reports described security lapses
including the bugging of a conference room and the theft of a
laptop computer, loaded with highly classified information, at the
State Department; allegations of misuse of nuclear weapons
information at Los Alamos, and concerns about government officials
flouting security regulations.
</P>
<P>
   What is going on? Did security discipline inside the United
States government collapse along with the Soviet Union? Has
technology, including the proliferation of computers, Internet
access and e-mail, made security significantly harder to enforce?
Is there a lack of concern about security among senior officials
and a concomitant inadequacy of priority and resources?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to all of these questions would appear to be yes.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, security problems are nothing new. Espionage from
abroad and violations of security rules at home were facts of life
during the Cold War and were found at virtually every department
and agency possessing sensitive information. All too often, misuse
of such information was attributable to senior officials.
</P>
<P>
   The technical problems in providing security are plainly more
difficult than they were a decade or two ago. The material on a
single floppy disk, carried out of a government building in a
pocket, once would have required a wheelbarrow to purloin. The
Internet creates an opportunity to send secrets anywhere in the
world without risky dead drops and brush passes. And there is the
temptation to bypass the rules by transferring secret information
to one's own computer for reasons as mundane as personal
convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Still, new technological advances are naturally answered by new
rules and monitoring techniques. As before, good security is
primarily a matter of compliance with rules and procedures that
already exist.
</P>
<P>
   A deeper change is atmospheric. In World War II and, to a
somewhat lesser extent, during the Cold War, there was a very real
sense on the part of those with access to sensitive information
that security really mattered because of the stakes involved in
those struggles. This didn't stop a small number of Americans from
spying for others and a much larger number from leaking secrets.
Overall, though, there was more discipline, and more people cared,
because we were in life and death conflicts and few wanted to give
our adversaries any advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the risks seem smaller now to many _ including not
only people directly charged with protecting secrets, but also
those who control their budgets. As defense, intelligence and
diplomatic budgets have shrunk, resources for security _ physical
safety as well as protection of information _ often have been early
victims of the budget axes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, tone and attitude at the top are vital.
From the outset of the current administration, whether by allowing
people to work at the White House before security clearances were
approved by the FBI or showing indifference to and even disdain for
security as a manifestation of a ``Cold War mindset,'' a message
has been sent that these issues are no longer very important.
Individual senior officials in various departments and agencies
have reinforced that message, partly with arrogant attitudes
conveying the idea that the rules do not apply to them.

   Good security still starts and ends with trust, integrity and
seriousness of purpose. Agencies need more resources. But simply
observing the rules that already exist, from the top down, would go
a long way.

LEBANON IN ACCORD WITH U.N. ON ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also ISRAEL-LEBANON-BORDER) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Lebanon has indicated that it will abide by
the United Nations' certification of Israel's withdrawal from
southern Lebanon, the U.N. special envoy to the Middle East, Terje
Rowed-Larsen, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If Larsen's assessment proves true, it could smooth a
significant bump in the road ahead. A rejection by Lebanon of the
United Nations' certification would give the green light to
guerrillas of the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah, or Party of God, to
continue their violent struggle against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   With official Lebanese acceptance, however, Hezbollah, despite
its fiery statements, would probably incline toward restraint.
Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, the group's leader, has said many times
that he would not defy the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, in another sign of the way Nasrallah and the Lebanese
establishment are embracing each other this week, the sheik
appeared for the first time in front of a Lebanese, rather than a
Hezbollah, flag at a large victory rally.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern town of Bint Jubayl, a couple of miles from the
Israeli border, he also went out of his way to pronounce the
Israeli withdrawal earlier this week from its former security zone
as a victory for all of Lebanon and not just for his fighters.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Nasrallah spoke freely and casually with
foreign journalists, analyzing events for the first time since the
Israeli withdrawal. He said the fact that the Israelis were able to
withdraw without any casualties was not for Hezbollah's lack of
trying. His fighters fired on Israeli troops but they did so under
heavy aircraft cover and at night, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sheik also said that Hezbollah's march through southern
Lebanon on Tuesday, when they retook village after village and
forced an overnight Israeli withdrawal from the zone, was so
spontaneous that neither Syria nor Iran knew about it in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They found out like everybody else did,'' Nasrallah said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese president and prime minister have not made their
position on the U.N. certification process public, even as U.N.
teams fanned out across southern Lebanon on Friday to verify
whether Israel's withdrawal was complete.
</P>
<P>
   While lower-level Lebanese officials and their Syrian
counterparts insisted that the U.N. determination would be
discounted, they avoided the subject and spoke positively of
collaborating with the United Nations in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese government's position has been murky since the U.N.
Security Council rejected Beirut's claim that the withdrawal would
be complete only if Israel also pulled out of a pocket of disputed
land beside the Golan Heights _ a remote, rugged area known as the
Shebaa Farms.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, rejecting the Security Council's position would
prove costly for Lebanon, which not only needs the United Nations'
assistance but seeks international backing to rebuild the
war-ravaged southern zone. On the other hand, Lebanon faces
pressure from Hezbollah and Syria to hold fast to its principles.
</P>
<P>
   Giving Lebanon a way to accept the United Nations' authority
without compromising its position, the United Nations underlined
that it was not determining sovereignty over the Shebaa Farms area,
which was under Syrian control when Israel occupied it. Lebanon and
Syria could draft new maps clearly defining their border, Larsen
said, and petition the U.N. Security Council to change its
resolutions governing the territories accordingly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Any nongovernmental organization that hopes to be treated as
legitimate has to adapt to the decisions of the Security Council,
too,'' Larsen said, referring to Hezbollah and other resistance
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah has an interest in keeping the conflict alive, apart
from its ideological one. If the withdrawal is accepted, the
Lebanese army will eventually move into the southern zone and then
seek to disarm the guerrillas. But Hezbollah and the Syrian
government, which assists it, are not ready to lay down their
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   So it suits their purposes to insist that the occupation of
southern Lebanon still exists even if Hezbollah quietly agrees not
to take the initiative in any violence toward Israel. How this
contradiction resolves itself will be seen after the United Nations
certifies the Israeli withdrawal, which is expected to happen soon.
</P>
<P>
   Nasrallah said this week that Hezbollah would not attack
civilians across the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then again,'' he said, ``not all Israelis are civilians, so
anything is possible.''

TALKS UNDER WAY TO INVOLVE BRADLEY IN GORE CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also GORE) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the more than two months since Vice President Al
Gore vanquished former Sen. Bill Bradley in the quest for the
Democratic presidential nomination, the two men have not spoken.
But there are signs there may soon be a rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Bradley say they expect the former senator from New
Jersey to appear with Gore sometime before the Democratic
convention in August, and possibly as soon as next month. And in a
news conference Thursday night, Gore acknowledged as much.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he expected to appear publicly with Bradley, Gore
imitated a fortune teller, closing his eyes, pointing a finger to
his temple and saying, ``I see that in the future.'' He declined to
say when the appearance would take place.
</P>
<P>
   And though the two men have not spoken in weeks, Gore contended
that their relationship is ``in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people are in regular communication,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some people have doubts that those talks can overcome the
bad feelings left by the primaries. Disappointed by his failure to
win a single state and dismayed by Gore's brass-knuckle campaign,
Bradley disappeared from public view after bowing out of the race
on March 9. And Gore, who rarely even mentions Bradley on the
stump, has made little effort to draw him out, raising questions
about whether the vice president even considered Bradley's support
useful.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive
Republican nominee, held a splashy news conference more than two
weeks ago to announce the endorsement of his main primary rival,
Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   But aides to the two Democrats have been in negotiations that
are expected to culminate in plans for Bradley to campaign for, and
possibly with, Gore. Conducting the negotiations are Tony Coelho,
Gore's campaign chairman, and Rick Wright, Bradley's close friend
and former campaign treasurer. The talks have focused largely on
Bradley's role at the convention and the number of delegates he
will be assigned.
</P>
<P>
   In his news conference, Gore said Bradley will definitely be
given time to speak at the convention. Asked about negotiations
over delegates, the vice president replied, ``I don't think there
will be a problem of any kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Bradley say talks between the two camps have been
reasonably smooth. But some friends of Bradley contend that Gore
should have acted sooner to unify the party and recruit Bradley's
help. They say one reason that Bradley has kept a low profile is
that Gore has not called him directly to request his support.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've obviously made a calculation that they don't need
Bradley's help,'' said one Democratic member of Congress who
supported Bradley during the primaries. ``But I think that's a
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear if Bradley will formally endorse Gore. When he
withdrew from the race in March, Bradley said he would support
Gore, but refrained from using the word ``endorse.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Bradley insisted that he was not playing word games
and that he intended to work hard for Gore _ even as he refused to
say the e-word.

 &HT;    Delta subsidiary opposes AirTran flights to National
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AirTran Airways' application for new rights to fly
between Atlanta and Washington's Reagan National Airport ought to
be tossed out, a subsidiary of rival Delta Air Lines says.
</P>
<P>
   In a filing with the U.S. Department of Transportation, Atlantic
Southeast Airlines argues that a law opening National to new
carriers is aimed at boosting service to smaller airports _ not
huge hubs like Hartsfield International.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unclear whether AirTran is requesting that the
department disregard the law entirely or merely ignore the fact
that all its flights from National will (oh by the way) stop in
Atlanta before going to cities which do qualify,'' ASA said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department should dismiss AirTran's application for
failure to qualify under the law.''
</P>
<P>
   ASA, owned by Delta, also wants National flights. But it's
seeking approval for service to Jacksonville, a route it says fits
the law's intent.
</P>
<P>
   ASA and AirTran are among several carriers vying for ``slot
exemptions'' at National created in an aviation funding bill signed
into law this spring. Slots are airline-owned landing rights used
to control congestion at National and a few other airports.
</P>
<P>
   The exemptions will enable DOT-designated carriers to add
service at National without slots. They are intended in part to
foster more service between National and small and midsized
airports.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran, in an application filed May 5, sought approval for five
daily Hartsfield-National round-trips. It said it would also offer
one-stop service via Hartsfield to three smaller Southeast cities
and connections to many more. AirTran argued its presence on the
routes would bring down fares.
</P>
<P>
   But ASA called that a pretext to gain access to the
Hartsfield-National nonstop market, now served only by Delta and US
Airways. AirTran flies to outlying Washington Dulles International
but could generate more business traffic flying to National.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran Marketing Director Tad Hutcheson said ASA's filing shows
that ``Delta, through a subsidiary, obviously wants to keep its
stranglehold on one of the nation's busiest air markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The DOT will award the exemptions this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Separately Friday, ASA said it plans to start regional jet
flights between Atlanta and Dallas-Love Field July 1, the first
service on the route. The flights will augment Delta's existing
service between Atlanta and Dallas-Fort Worth International, a
route also flown nonstop by AirTran.

SERENA WILLIAMS WITHDRAWS FROM FRENCH OPEN; SAMPRAS TO FACE
PHILIPPOUSIS
</HEADLINE>
  By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Citing an injury to her left knee, Serena Williams
withdrew from the French Open Friday shortly before the draw had
been conducted.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a tough year for the Williams sisters, who thrived
on all surfaces and in all mediums in 1999. Because of tendinitis
in her wrists, Venus Williams has only played four matches and has
lost two of them. The younger Serena, the reigning U.S. Open
champion, has not played for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   The French Open is set to begin Monday, when fans will be able
to see how the Roland Garros complex has been transformed in a
hurry. The center court on which Steffi Graf and Andre Agassi
surprised the tennis world, and themselves, by winning last year's
singles titles, was partly torn down two weeks after their
victories. It was rebuilt to create more comfortable and spacious
environs for players and officials. The bad news is that there are
now 1,000 fewer seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year the French seem to try something different here, to
improve their facilities in one way or another,'' said Michael
Chang, the 1989 French Open champion. ``It's unbelievable how they
got this all up in 10 months.''
</P>
<P>
   Counting his victory here, Agassi has won three of the last four
Grand Slam events, but his play has been listless in recent weeks.
Even though he has a straightforward first-round match against a
French wild card, Anthony Dupuis, it might be considered bold to
pick the top-seeded player to defend his title here. To do so, he
would have to beat the likes of Gustavo Kuerten, Alex Corretja,
Dominik Hrbaty, Marat Safin, Cedric Pioline and Magnus Norman and
an abundance of what the French call ``les outsiders dangereux'' in
the draw.
</P>
<P>
   It would require even more pluck to pick Pete Sampras to win the
only Grand Slam trophy still missing from his Beverly Hills home.
Even though he is capable of beating anyone on his least favorite
surface _ witness that his victory over Norman on Thursday in
Duesseldorf, Germany, came in the relatively meaningless World Team
Cup _ he is also capable of faltering against anyone.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening round, the second-seeded Sampras will face Mark
Philippousis. The hard-serving Australian was up a set on Sampras
in the Wimbledon quarterfinals last year before being forced to
retire with a knee injury. And for all of his natural force and
taste for risk, Philippousis is quite comfortable on clay and
played brilliantly indoors on it during Australia's Davis Cup
victory over France last December.
</P>
<P>
   Philippousis is not seeded here because his recent form has been
patchy, but then so has Sampras'. After an injury-forced layoff, he
was beaten in straight sets last week in the German Open by Arnaud
Di Pasquale of France. It was Sampras' only official clay-court
tournament so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   And lurking in the third round in Sampras' section of the draw
could be either Hicham Arazi, who usually saves his best for Roland
Garros, or Markus Hipfl, a huffing, grunting, clay-loving Austrian
who plays a bit like Thomas Muster.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Sampras-Philippousis, there are other intriguing
first-round matchups, including Marcelo Rios versus Tommy Haas;
Kuerten versus Sweden's newest teen-ager with talent, Andres
Vinciguerra; and Lleyton Hewitt, the Australian teen-ager who is
seeded for the first time in a Grand Slam event, versus feisty the
American veteran Jeff Tarango, who has played quite well of late.
</P>
<P>
   The women's draw has some first-round encounters worth
underscoring. Jennifer Capriati, seeded 15th, could have difficulty
against Colombia's Fabiola Zuluaga if she does not recover the
fitness and consistency that were missing in Rome last week.
Lindsay Davenport, seeded No. 2, could struggle against Dominique
Van Roost if her injured back is not sufficiently healed to let her
swing and serve away with her customary force and confidence.
Third-seeded Monica Seles also has a potentially tricky match
against Silvija Talaja, although Seles' focused and occasionally
ferocious play on her way to the Italian Open title make a strong
case for her winning here.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, top-seeded Martina Hingis lost the final, her
composure and a fair number of fans against Graf. Now, still seeded
first, she has another chance to win it all, opening in the first
round against Sabine Appelmans.

SPURNED STUDENT ACCUSES OXFORD UNIVERSITY OF ELITISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Laura Spence doesn't look much like a revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   But when the unassuming 18-year-old honors student from a
middle-class high school in northern England accused Oxford
University, Britain's most exclusive, of elitism because it
rejected her application, she reignited the long-simmering class
war that divides this nation.
</P>
<P>
   If some here would like to dismiss Spence as a purveyor of sour
grapes who couldn't make the grade at Oxford, their case is
severely weakened by the fact that she has won a $100,000
scholarship to Harvard University. She will begin her freshman year
in Cambridge _ Massachusetts, not England _ next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Spence's complaint that Oxford favors rich students from private
schools and privileged families has won her influential allies,
including Gordon Brown, chancellor of the exchequer and second only
to Prime Minister Tony Blair as the most powerful figure in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Brown called Oxford's decision to reject Spence ``an absolute
scandal,'' and said she was the victim of ``an interview system
that is more reminiscent of the old boy network and the old school
tie than genuine justice in our society.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is about time for an end to that old Britain where what
matters more are the privileges you are born with rather than the
potential you actually have,'' Brown fumed.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Blair said the prime minister backed Brown's
comments, and government ministers hinted that they might cut
Oxford's subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford, already reeling from recent claims that it was resting
on its ``Chariots of Fire'' laurels and had long ago lost its edge,
has tried to defend itself. Andrew Hobson, the admissions director
at Magdalen College, the Oxford school to which Spence had applied
to study medicine, insisted that her socioeconomic background had
nothing to do with her rejection.
</P>
<P>
   Spence's case has become front-page news in Britain, nearly all
of it sympathetic to her. In public debates, those who hold Oxford
up as a symbol of everything that's wrong with the smug,
self-satisfied element in Britain square off with traditionalists
who look down their noses at anything outside the realm and defend
the old ways as the best ways.
</P>
<P>
   The tabloids are gleefully rubbing the toffs' noses in it, while
even the more right-wing, traditional voices in the British media
are asking why such a bright English girl has to skip off to
America to get a top-notch education.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kelley, the head teacher at Monkseaton Community High
School in North Tyneside, where Spence is one of the most
accomplished students, believes Spence stirred a much-needed debate
in Britain about class and higher education.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has touched a raw nerve, and that's a good thing,'' said
Kelley, an American, speaking from his office, while Spence sat
across from him, lamenting that yet another reporter wanted to talk
to her. ``Britain has a problem with discrimination, including
discriminating against people because of their class. But Britain
is in denial. Laura is forcing Britain to debate this.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Spence says Oxford believes someone who goes to a
posh school and speaks with a posh accent ``has more potential.''
She said when she sat down for her old-fashioned interview with
university dons, at least one remarked on her distinctive
``Geordie'' accent from northeast England.
</P>
<P>
   By Oxford's own admission, Harvard makes more spaces available
to the less privileged. Speaking by telephone from her office,
where she has been besieged by British journalists, Rebecca
Rollins, a Harvard spokeswoman, said that 70 percent of Harvard
students receive financial aid, the average yearly package being
$22,000.
</P>
<P>
   About 48 percent of Oxford students come from private schools,
compared with the average of 18 percent at other British
universities. Private schools in Britain don't have anything
approaching the scholarships offered at American private schools,
so Britons who go to private school tend to be wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley, a native of Berkeley, Calif., said Britain lacks the
antidiscrimination laws that would long ago have transformed Oxford
into a university that better reflects the nation it serves. ``In
the States, Oxford would have been in court 30 years ago. They
would have been dead to rights on a class-action discrimination
suit,'' he said. ``But this isn't the States.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely, say Oxford's defenders. Some traditionalists view
Americans as gun-toting Philistines who are useful allies during
wartime but otherwise fairly useless. Even more reasonable critics
think American higher education is too market-driven and not as
dedicated to academic excellence as Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown, Spence's most powerful ally, says that is elitist
poppycock. It was Brown's idea to get Cambridge University,
Britain's other premier institution, to form an alliance with the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology this year. Rather than
dismiss the greater ability of MIT graduates to start companies and
create jobs as evidence of the soulless American pursuit of the
almighty dollar, Brown wants to emulate it, so that more of
Britain's best and brightest engage in a pursuit of the almighty
pound.
</P>
<P>
   When Spence gets to Harvard, she'll be reunited with Lara Dixon,
who was one year ahead of her at Monkseaton and was also rejected
by Oxford. Dixon is at Harvard studying business. Kelley said seven
of his top students are considering enrolling in American
universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laura is just the kind of person Harvard wants: bright, smart,
and someone who can do anything she puts her mind to,'' said
Kelley. ``You attack Oxford at your peril. But she is a young woman
of extraordinary character.''

   FATIMA GATE, Israel-Lebanon border _ Israelis poured from tour
buses and cars Friday to view the country's newest and probably
most unusual tourist attraction: jeering Lebanese waving Hezbollah
flags as they pressed up against the wire fence that marks the
border with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shmulik, take my picture!'' shouted one tourist, Yael Levy, to
her husband as she posed on a pile of boulders a few hundred feet
from the border.
</P>
<P>
   The Levys said they had been on vacation in the north when they
heard it was possible to see Hezbollah fighters on the other side
of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid,'' she said. ``It's exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The now-closed border crossing known as the Good Fence, used by
the thousands of Lebanese who worked in Israel until this week, has
undergone quite a change since the last Israeli soldier was
withdrawn from south Lebanon on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Once a site where tour groups came to learn why Israel occupied
a 9-mile deep strip of south Lebanon, the security zone set up to
protect northern communities from guerrilla attacks is now a spot
where people can glimpse the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   On the Lebanese side of the fence, an armed Hezbollah fighter
kept a close watch on the crowds of Lebanese also taking photos, as
well as the Israelis on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drove three hours to see this,'' said Leora Sar, a
49-year-old Israeli carefully making her way up a pile of rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli soldiers, who have been ordered not to shoot across the
border unless their lives are endangered, now simply patrol the
Israeli side of the fence and stop tourists who try to get too
close.
</P>
<P>
   The flower-filled park where tour guides used to bring people is
now off-limits because its edge is the border, prompting visitors
to climb the rocks on one side of the park to get a better look.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been here many times but this time we came specially
because we heard last night that the Hezbollah were here,'' said
Rifka Sayad, 58.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's unilateral withdrawal fulfilled an election promise
made by Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who wanted to end an occupation
that was increasingly unpopular among Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   But the pullout has raised concern about whether Israel will be
able to protect the mountainous border, which it is hurriedly is
trying to fortify.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over whether Israelis in the north are more at risk
of attack because of the withdrawal was echoed among the tourists
on the rocks, some of whom shouted at each other while others
shouted at the Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let Barak come up here and live with us if he thinks it's so
safe!'' Keren Amar yelled at a man who was explaining to a friend
why Israel's withdrawal was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Amar, 22, from the nearby town of Kiryat Shmona, was one of the
few Israelis who said they were more frightened than intrigued by
what they saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to apply for a job in Metulla, but after seeing
those people I don't want to be so close to them,'' said Amar,
mentioning the town down the hill.
</P>
<P>
   While the sight of Lebanese demonstrators may be a draw for some
Israelis, shopowners who used to make a good living selling snacks
and trinkets to Lebanese workers, soldiers, and tourists are
worried that the pullout will mean financial ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Already about half of the shops are shuttered.
</P>
<P>
   Even the tour guides sounded uncharacteristically downbeat.
``It's never appealing to see something like this,'' said guide
Menachem Hefetz as he shepherded an Israeli woman and her Italian
husband up the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   But his clients were in no rush to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were supposed to come here on a big tour,'' said Gabriella
David, ``but it was canceled because all the flights up here were
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we grabbed the guide and came. We wanted to see this and
I'm happy we did,'' she said, ``even if my blood pressure has gone
up.''

SAUL STEINBERG WILL SELL RELIANCE TO LEUCADIA 
</HEADLINE>
   By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saul P. Steinberg, a corporate raider famous for
trying but failing to acquire such big-name companies as Walt
Disney and Chemical Bank, announced Friday what amounts to a final
withdrawal from a flamboyant career.
</P>
<P>
   Reliance Group Holdings, the insurance company that had
supported Steinberg's corporate sallies for three decades, is being
sold to Leucadia National Corp. for $295 million in stock and the
assumption of $725 million in debt. The company had suffered big
losses recently.
</P>
<P>
   Once the sale is approved by regulators, Steinberg, who is 60,
will no longer control any U.S. company. ``He will continue to be
active in business and philanthropic affairs,'' a Reliance
spokesman said, ``although he has not made any specific plans.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale will bring him $93 million in Leucadia stock, if he
still owns the 36.4 million Reliance shares listed in his name last
Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   But his fortune has clearly shrunk. The 36.4 million shares were
worth $364 million a year ago, and at a Sotheby's auction on Friday
Steinberg and his wife sold $12 million worth of his personal
belongings, mostly sterling silver and other furnishings from his
34-room Park Avenue apartment, itself sold in March for over $30
million. Steinberg has also been selling a collection of paintings.
</P>
<P>
   The Reliance sale will bring 0.11 of a share of Leucadia stock
for each Reliance share. That values Reliance at $2.55 a share, or
less than a third of the stock's $10 value when Steinberg took
Reliance public in 1986. In addition, Leucadia, an investment
company whose holdings include insurance companies, agreed to take
over $735 million in Reliance debt, much of it due this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a thorough review and careful deliberation, and
concluded that this was the best decision for our shareholders and
customers,'' the Reliance spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Reliance, headquartered in New York, with 3,000 employees,
reported an operating loss of $318.3 million last year, and $36.5
million in this year's first quarter. Recent blows included a major
setback in a workers' compensation insurance arrangement that went
sour. Steinberg stepped down as chief executive in late February,
on the day Reliance announced the sale of its profitable ``crown
jewel,'' a surety unit, for $580 million.
</P>
<P>
   These were the final chapters of a career that began to soar in
1961 when Steinberg, only 22 years old, pioneered the
computer-leasing business, and his new company, named Leasco,
quickly reported a profit. The young entrepreneur took Leasco
public in 1965 and the stock soared _ giving Steinberg the
wherewithal in 1968 to take over Reliance, a prosperous insurance
company nearly 10 times Leasco's size.
</P>
<P>
   That turned out to be Steinberg's only significant takeover. His
disastrous attempt to acquire Chemical Bank in 1969 failed when
Leasco's stock came under attack. And his subsequent attempts over
the years to get control of Walt Disney and other big companies
were no more successful, although he often walked away from these
raids richer for the investments.

EMBARGO AGAINST CUBA GROWS HARDER TO DEFEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Twice this week, the House has faced the question:
Should the United States liberalize trade with a communist country,
despite its history of violating human rights?
</P>
<P>
   First, amid great fanfare, Congress passed a bill granting
permanent normal trade relations to China, a move Republican
leaders promised would help move the country toward democracy. But
when several congressmen tried the next day to apply the same logic
to Cuba, promoting legislation to allow the sale of food and
medicine, the idea was brushed aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the same thing,'' said Representative Charles Bass, a
New Hampshire Republican, who voted for the China bill, but opposes
sending goods to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very easy to see the distinction,'' Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big difference,'' agreed GOP presidential candidate
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   To a growing number of legislators, however, the distinction
between China and Cuba is becoming increasingly hard to defend,
given that Cuba has not posed a serious security threat to the
United States in years. Moreover, the Elian Gonzalez affair has
caused some lawmakers to reassess the Cuban-American lobby, which
has passionately defended the embargo for four decades, as out of
touch with US public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Several congressmen this week said the difference in handling
the two nations was outright hypocritical, by members on both sides
of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The fault lines in Congress on trade policy are largely the
same, with a sizable number of Republicans supporting free trade
with China but not Cuba, and a number of Democrats doing the
reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Representatives J. Joseph Moakley and James
McGovern, two Democrats who opposed the China deal, are helping
lead the campaign to bring food and medicine to Cuba and would like
to see the overall embargo disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you lifted the embargo completely, the cell phones and the
e-mails would take over,'' Moakley said. ``The country would become
very economically sound. It's only 90 miles from the United States.
. . . It would be very difficult for a dictator to rule over an
economically successful country.''
</P>
<P>
   That political argument, almost identical to the one presented
during the China debate, appears to be taking root among a number
of moderate Democrats and Republicans. So is the economic argument:
Doing business with Cuba, as with China, could mean significant
profits for US companies. According to estimates by the US
agriculture industry, American farmers would stand to dominate
Cuba's $700 million-a-year food market if the embargo were
moderated.
</P>
<P>
   And according to several legislators, the embargo measure open
up markets of $7 billion to US firms. The legislation would allow
the sale of food and medicine to Cuba and four other countries:
Iraq, Iran, North Korea, and Sudan. It would grant the president
the power to reimpose sanctions in the event of war. And it would,
its supporters hope, lead to a more consistent US trade policy,
rather than one formulated, in McGovern's words, ``from a mindset
of the Cold War.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard, intellectually, to distinguish between Cuba and
China,'' Representative George Nethercutt, a Washington Republican
who sponsored the measure, said in an interview. ``They are both
totalitarian. They are both abusers of human rights.'' Asked about
the refusal of many free-trade advocates to extend their philosophy
to Cuba, Nethercutt said: ``I find it inconsistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Mann, a political analyst at the Brookings Institution,
agreed. ``Of course it's inconsistent,'' he said. ``The whole
strategy that the president and the majority of Republicans are
pursuing is a strategy of using economic engagement to bring about
internal changes in countries and move them in a more democratic
direction. That strategy would seem appropriate for Cuba as well as
for China. But alas. Cuba's close. It's governed by Fidel Castro.
And there's an important domestic political constituency engaged in
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nethercutt legislation to lift the embargo against Cuba for
food and medicine was scheduled to come to a vote on Thursday as
part of a larger appropriations bill. But House Republican leaders,
who backed the deal with China but oppose the Cuba provision,
canceled the vote out of fear the measure would pass.
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt said he has at least 300 votes, far more than the
majority of 218, partly because of pressure from the farm lobby and
partly because the China agreement has thrust the US policy toward
Cuba in the spotlight, making it appear obsolete to some.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation may still come to a vote, depending on the
outcome of negotiations. Even if it does, however, it is unlikely
to have the powerful allies that secured the passage of the China
bill, most notably House Republican leaders and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   According to the terms of the 40-year-old Cuba embargo, and
under the administration's own interpretation of the 1996
Helms-Burton Act codifying the embargo, the president has the power
to alter sanctions on food and medicine. But the administration has
declined to promote trade with Cuba, and political analysts say it
is unlikely Clinton will do so before the November election,
especially given the opposition of the Cuban-American exile
community in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, that South Florida constituency has drawn negative
attention to the Cuba embargo through its noisy protests of the
handling of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez. While the case has proven
the exile community's political strength, it has also raised
questions about how the US-Cuba policy has been formed over the
years, leading some critics to accuse political leaders of bending
to a vocal Cuban-American minority that despises Castro.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Republican leaders also oppose doing business
with Cuba on ideological grounds. They see an array of differences
between China and Cuba. China, many argue, is a vast and
diversified nation that has taken halting steps toward democracy in
recent years. Cuba, on the other hand, is an island that makes no
bones about its devotion to Communism. And it is run by a single
man: Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``By trade with China, we're encouraging a group of
entrepreneurs and small-business owners to be able to get a taste
of freedom,'' Bush said at a news conference Tuesday. ``That's not
the case in Cuba. In Cuba, we're trading, in essence, with a
government-controlled entity. And my worry is that capital flowing
into Cuba will help prop up the Fidel Castro regime.''
</P>
<P>
   And Castro, Lott said, has ``shown no repentance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is running a dictatorship, a repressive dictatorship,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the inclination to favor one country over the other is not
limited to the Republicans. On Wednesday, the China bill passed
largely with Republican support. Only one-third of the Democrats
voted for the bill. Smaller still was the number of politicians
with a consistent position _ either supporting free trade across
the board or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   Although both Massachusetts senators favor free trade with both
Cuba and China, only Representative Patrick Kennedy, Democrat of
Rhode Island, has taken to the House floor twice in recent months
to label the leaders of China and Cuba with the same word:
``dictator.''

   HONGKONG-ECON (Hong Kong) _ Less than three years after a plunge
in the value of Thailand's currency triggered a devastating
economic crisis across much of Asia, the region is riding a wave of
growth reminiscent of the Asian miracle of the 1980s. The latest
evidence of the resurgence came Friday with a report that Hong
Kong's economic output rose 14.3 percent in the first three months
of the year. It was the territory's fastest quarter of growth since
late 1987. Other Asian economies are growing at rates much faster
than even the most optimistic forecasters had predicted _ powered,
to a large extent, by a booming demand for Asian exports into the
hot economy of the United States. By Mark Landler. (We plan to move

approval of the China trade deal, was no new affirmation of
internationalism by an often provincial Congress, but a
reaffirmation of one of its oldest truths: Members vote their
districts. That is, they vote their districts if their constituents
have an interest, and a trade bill is a singular foreign policy
measure because the question of jobs gained and lost commands

RELIGION COLUMN: MORE MISSIONARIES NOW THAN EVER, EXPERT SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Gerald H. Anderson has the sort of resume that, one
would expect, has allowed him an unusually broad view of trends
within Christianity worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   A United Methodist minister trained in church history, Anderson
has served as a seminary dean in the Philippines, a college
president in the United States, the head of two associations
dedicated to studying Christian missions, and the editor of many
books on that subject.
</P>
<P>
   As Anderson plans to retire next month after 24 years as
director of the Overseas Ministries Study Center in New Haven,
Conn., it seemed a good time to ask him what he thinks is the most
important development in Christianity during his professional life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just happened to be giving a lecture on this last night,''
said Anderson, reached by telephone on Thursday at a retreat center
in Georgia. What he told his audience, he said, was that
Christianity was no longer ``a predominately Western religion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of Christians live outside Europe and North
America,'' he said. ``And this represents a monumental shift in
what has been called the ecclesiastical center of gravity.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said the greatest momentum in the change has occurred
since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The study center Anderson directs publishes an annual survey,
relying on statistics gathered by David Barrett, editor of the
World Christian Encyclopedia (Oxford, 1982). Among much else,
Barrett's statistics point to an explosive growth of Christianity
in Africa in the 20th century, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of what has happened, Anderson cited the
Moravians, a Protestant group with roots in central European and
American communities that date back to the 18th century. Worldwide
there are about 700,000, of whom about 50,000 live in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of all Moravians in the world today are in Tanzania, in
east Africa,'' Anderson said. ``And the annual membership increase
in that nation is more than the total Moravian membership in the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The center that Anderson directs serves as a base for spiritual
renewal and study by missionaries and church leaders from around
the world. Typically, there are 50 to 60 people in residence, said
Jonathan J. Bonk, the associate director, who will succeed
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the way from Russian Orthodox to Korean Pentecostal,
living side by side,'' Bonk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reflect the shift from the north to the south, and the west
to the east, in the demography of our residential population,''
said, adding that at least 70 percent of those who come to study at
the center are from outside North America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said there is a common mistaken impression that
Christian missionary activity has been diminishing in the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, there are more missionaries at work today than ever
before in history,'' he said, adding that there are nearly 400,000
in the world including both Protestants and Roman Catholics, a more
than six-fold increase since 1900.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has changed is at least 100,000 of these missionaries are
being sent out by Protestant churches in non-Western countries,''
Anderson said. He added one more example: ``There are now an
estimated 8,000 Protestant Korean missionaries serving outside
Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEW EDITION OF SCRIPTURE GARNERS FAVOR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Diane M. Ritzie is an associate pastor, prison chaplain
and writer, but lately it is for another role that she has been
hearing a favorable response from around the country: work on the
``African American Jubilee Edition'' of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   The edition, which combines the Bible's full text with
illustrated articles on the Scripture's relationship to Africa,
African-Americans and the black church, is a new publication of the
American Bible Society in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Ritzie was the project's editor, taking over in December 1997
and arranging contributions from writers. The result is a Bible
prefaced with essays on subjects like ``The Relationship between
Hebrew and African Languages'' and ``The Presence and Role of
Africans in the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My aim was to offer hope to young African-Americans,'' said
Ritzie, an associate pastor at a Baptist church in New Rochelle,
N.Y..
</P>
<P>
   Although the edition _ it has been published in King James and
Contemporary English versions _ is meant to call attention to the
presence of blacks in Scripture, Ritzie said, ``I don't call it a
black Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I feel God is an inclusive God,'' she said. Africans
and African- Americans are included in the Bible among God's
people, she said, adding, ``God is a multicultural God and all
nations are included in the Scriptures.''

ANALYSIS: WHY HOUSE BACKED CLINTON ON CHINA TRADE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The most important foreign policy vote so far this
year, the 237-197 House vote to approve of the China trade deal,
was no new affirmation of internationalism by an often provincial
Congress, but a reaffirmation of one of its oldest truths: members
vote their districts.
</P>
<P>
   That is, they vote their districts if their constituents have an
interest, and a trade bill is a singular foreign policy measure
because the question of jobs gained and lost commands attention
from lawmakers and constituents ordinarily not much concerned about
the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But other foreign policy matters have far smaller
constituencies, and are much more subject to Washington's political
influences, especially partisanship. To put it meanly, each party
plays politics with foreign policy; to put it kindly, each trusts
presidents of its own party but discerns grave weaknesses on the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the ``internationalist'' Republicans who supported
President George Bush's Persian Gulf war suddenly became
``isolationist'' Republicans who opposed President Clinton over
military action in Somalia (where Bush actually had sent the the
troops), as well as in Bosnia and Kosovo. The Democrats, meanwhile,
eagerly seized the labels the Republicans had dropped.
</P>
<P>
   There are some members of Congress who take the
``internationalist'' view on trade, intervention abroad, United
Nations funding and comparable issues regardless of party, at least
most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   But looking at a dozen key votes dating back to the Gulf War,
there are only 10 current House members who voted that way all the
time. Several are Southern Democrats with no union pressure over
trade to worry about. Two are Democrats from Washington state,
where union desires to sell Boeing airplanes to China overcome all
other trade questions. And one is a moderate Republican, Rep.
Connie Morella from the suburbs of Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   But most representatives rise or fall on domestic records, and
for them ``foreign policy is totally unimportant most of the
time,'' said Dr. Barbara Bardes, a political scientist at the
University of Cincinnati. ``They are available for those swing
votes as long as it doesn't hurt them.''
</P>
<P>
   And more of them are available these days because two factors
encouraging instinctive support of a president no longer matter.
</P>
<P>
   One was the Cold War, which drew the argument that the United
States would seem weak to the Soviet Union if the president could
not enforce his foreign policy views, even in areas of no concern
to the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   A second is the departure of the World War II generation from
Congress. Only nine veterans of that war now serve in the House.
The Senate has lost the voice of Bob Dole, who could tell his
colleagues that once the president had made a decision, even a weak
one, he must be supported.
</P>
<P>
   The ``sort of `president knows best' attitude is gone,'' said
another student of congressional behavior on foreign policy, James
McCormack, an Iowa State University political scientist.
</P>
<P>
   It has been replaced by the skeptical veterans and non-veterans
of the Vietnam War era, for whom ``the commander-in-chief thing
doesn't work,'' said Bardes. ``They are worried about becoming too
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude produces resolutions demanding withdrawal of
troops from Bosnia and Kosovo, delays in appropriations for drug
wars in Colombia, and, at its most intense level, Senate rejection
of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The consequence is that, ``given the polarization of the
parties, almost any major initiative requires a major effort'' by
the president, said Bob Pastor, a political scientist at Emory
University.
</P>
<P>
   This China trade bill got that intense effort, not just from the
administration, but from business and House Republicans, too.
</P>
<P>
   But without outside allies of the weight of the business
interests that backed this bill, the administration lost the
nuclear test treaty and faces continual difficulties in getting the
money to pay back dues to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   That effort was required because even if this was fundamentally
a trade bill, where most of the votes depended on jobs gained for
Florida fertilizer mills or lost to textile plants in North
Carolina, it also carried the baggage of a foreign policy measure
about a government whom no one in Congress will defend. This was
not a pure trade measure, like the question of extending lower
tariffs to Chile.
</P>
<P>
   The 57 Republicans who voted ``no'' were primarily motivated by
China's treatment of Christians and political dissidents, plus its
reported espionage activity against the United States. And others
were tempted, doubting the argument that trade would broaden
Chinese society.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., dripped with sarcasm: ``We have been
told wonderful things will flow from expanded trade with China.
Workers' rights will be respected, religious freedom will be
enhanced, and probably Jeffersonian study groups will be popping up
all over China.''
</P>
<P>
   John J. Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, called the charge of
protectionism ``very unfair.'' He said in an interview: ``We
realize the value of trade with any country. We recognize the
expansion of globalization. But in this new global economy, we must
strive for rules that protect human rights and workers rights and
the environment and not just profits.'' It was the bill itself that
was protectionist, he said, as an ``outright attempt to protect
profits without any concern for human rights and workers' rights.''
</P>
<P>
   That argument was often heard on the House floor. Rep. Janice D.
Schakowsky, D-Ill., said the bill encouraged U.S. companies to take
``advantage of the nearest slave labor conditions and wages.'' That
sort of attack went largely unchallenged. But arguments like those
of Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., prevailed. She saw huge
opportunities for U.S. energy, gas, construction, telecom and
engineering companies in China. ``Not only for New Jersey,'' she
said, ``but for the nation, the bottom line here is that this is a
jobs bill.''

   METULLA, Israel _ Ram Eisenberg, an architect from Tel Aviv,
leaned on a barbed-wire border fence on Friday and gazed at the
crowd that was chanting slogans and waving the red and yellow
banners of Hezbollah at the Lebanese village of Kafr Kila on the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you happy?'' he asked the group, many of whom had returned
to southern Lebanon after Wednesday's Israeli troop withdrawal and
came on Friday to celebrate victory at the Israeli border. ``We're
happy for you. Welcome home.''
</P>
<P>
   A Shi'ite Muslim woman covered head to toe in an Iranian-style
black chador said, ``It's our land,'' and Eisenberg agreed. ``We're
happy for you to go home,'' he repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Someone handed him a Hezbollah handbill, which he pocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Then the woman asked Eisenberg if he was Israeli, adding
matter-of-factly, ``If you are Israeli, I kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed, Eisenberg replied, ``I hope you change your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The bizarre encounter, impossible two days ago, was part of the
new reality that has swiftly taken shape here since the Israeli
pullout.
</P>
<P>
   A border crossing that had been run by the Israelis, known as
the Good Fence, where relatives of their Lebanese militia allies
used to come to work in Israel, vanished overnight as the Israelis
moved back to the international boundary.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the area was swamped by Lebanese visitors who walked
and cruised in honking vehicles on their side of the border fence,
hoisting banners of Hezbollah and another Shiite group, Amal, in
full view of Israeli soldiers and visitors to Metulla.
</P>
<P>
   A big yellow banner had the words ``Thanks to Hezbollah.''
Nearby stood a cardboard mock-up of a Katyusha rocket-launcher,
Hezbollah's favored weapon against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The defiant display of support for what Israelis have long
considered an archenemy caused hardly a ripple on the Israeli side.
The soldiers just looked on, and Israeli sightseers, kept at a
distance by the troops, peered at the convoys through binoculars,
trying to identify the militia flags by their colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let 'em blow off steam,'' said Yaakov Orbach, a visitor from
Petah Tikvah.
</P>
<P>
   Moshe Biton, from neighboring Kiryat Shemona, a town that has
been battered by Hezbollah rockets, said as he watched: ``It
doesn't bother me. It's their territory and they have a right to do
what they want, as long as no Israelis are hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivka Sayag, from Holon, chatted on a cell phone with a friend,
describing the spectacle across the fence. ``It's kind of nice,''
she said. ``If we live in peace, it'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the withdrawal, residents of Israeli border communities
have been enjoying just that. After years in which the thunder of
artillery and the clatter of helicopters were the background noise
of daily life, a remarkable quiet has settled over the border zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quiet is ringing in my ears,'' said Yossi Beter of Kibbutz
Lahavot Habashan.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone was happy with the changes across the fence.
Looking through binoculars, Yisrael Abramov, a contractor from
Herzliya, said that Hezbollah's victory celebrations were the
result of a hurried and disorganized Israeli pullout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that they're waving flags and we're not,'' he
said. ``We've lost faith in our flag and country.''
</P>
<P>
   Assi Shaul, a teen-ager from Kiryat Shemona, felt the same way.
``This is a disgrace,'' he said. Climbing a pile of boulders to
look at the flag-wavers on the other side, he shouted, ``We'll burn
you!''
</P>
<P>
   On the Lebanese side, people vented anger at Israel, bitter
after years of occupation, shelling and bombardments that had
caused thousands of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no peace with Israel, because they've killed
children and destroyed houses,'' said Hassan Rashid, a student who
returned to his village, Khiam, after eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Other people said there could be no guarantee of peace along the
frontier, because Israel was Arab land. ``Ask Hezbollah what will
happen,'' a woman shouted. ``If Israel leaves Palestine, there will
be peace.''
</P>
<P>
   There was evident pride that this time the Israelis had been
compelled to withdraw from Arab territory.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A group of Druze from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights arrived
at the border fence from the Israeli side to share the moment with
the Lebanese. Flashing V-signs high in the air, Saleh Abu Saleh
from Majdal Shams wished for a speedy Israeli withdrawal from the
Golan. ``God willing it will happen soon,'' he boomed. ``Victory to
the Arabs.''
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the slogans and the display of symbols, there were
tentative signs of readiness to keep the border calm.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli soldiers kept a low profile, emerging from their base
only once to remove people on the Israeli side who had approached
the border fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a calm, not peace,'' said Issam Rashid, also from Khiam.
``We agree to be calm here. We are not aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisenberg, the architect, said that his verbal exchange with the
Lebanese across the barbed wire was a modest achievement. ``It was
a chance for them to see that there's a human being on the other
side,'' he said.

FORMER GOP CONGRESSMEN COMPETE IN PRIMARY FOR OLD JOB
</HEADLINE>
  By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITEHOUSE, N.J. _ Whatever you do, don't ask Mike Pappas to
sing.
</P>
<P>
   During the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton,
Pappas, then a freshman Republican, stood up on the House floor and
sang a ditty honoring Kenneth Starr, the prosecutor, to the tune of
``Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming just as public impatience with the Republican-led
proceedings was boiling over, the performance became infamous
enough that Pappas' Democratic rival, Rush Holt, was able to turn
it into prime advertising fodder, and he went on to win the
reliably Republican seat.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Pappas finds himself in an unusual primary race to win back
the seat featuring two former congressmen: Pappas and Richard
Zimmer, who gave up the job in 1996 for an unsuccessful Senate bid
against Bob Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
   The race for the seat, which had been Republican for decades,
figures to be one of the most hotly contested House elections in
the nation, with control of the House up for grabs and Republicans
now holding a slim six-seat majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most vulnerable seats in the country,''
said Marit Babin, a spokeswoman for the National Republican
Congressional Committee. ``Rush Holt better watch out.''
</P>
<P>
   But before Republicans can take aim at Holt, the party must
endure a messy fight in the June 6 primary between Pappas, an
unvarnished conservative, and Zimmer, a social moderate.
</P>
<P>
   It is a matchup between two very different Republicans, one that
is exposing the deep divisions within the national party. The House
majority whip, Tom DeLay, and the House majority leader, Dick Armey
_ both staunch conservatives _ are supporting Pappas, while Zimmer
has been endorsed by House speaker, Dennis Hastert, and Rep. Thomas
Davis, head of the party's congressional election committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NRCC has vowed to target Rush Holt, but so far we've seen
nothing but an unending food fight among Republicans,'' said John
Del Cecato, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee. ``These two guys are clawing at each other, and whoever
emerges is going to be damaged goods for the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   After months of unexpected civility, the two candidates recently
began attacking each other. Zimmer, not surprisingly, began airing
a radio ad featuring his opponent singing, and Pappas sent out a
mailing that accuses his rival of inspiring New Jersey's income tax
when he was the head of Common Cause in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Zimmer's supporters circulated a videocassette of
the recital among party stalwarts to scare off potential backers of
Pappas.
</P>
<P>
   That tactic seems to have worked. Zimmer has rounded up
endorsements from most every top party official in the state,
including Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, former Gov. Thomas Kean and
Chuck Haytaian, the party chairman. The district's five county
committees are also supporting Zimmer, who has raised just over $1
million, compared with $225,000 for Pappas.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those supporting Zimmer say electability, not ideology,
was the deciding factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see that district come back into Republican hands,
and the bottom line is that Dick has the better chance of beating
Rush Holt,'' Haytaian said.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas may lack money and big-name backers, but he has the
impassioned support of local anti-abortion campaigners, gun
enthusiasts and social conservatives. Angry over what they say is
Zimmer's flip-flopping on their issues, groups like New Jersey
Right to Life and the New Jersey Sportsman Association are vowing
to mobilize their troops on June 6.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Lance, a Republican assemblyman who lost to Pappas in a
three-way Congressional race in 1996, said low turnout, especially
in a year without a contested presidential primary in the major
parties, could swing the election away from Zimmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The true believers always vote,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Shaftan, a consultant who ran the first Pappas campaign for
Congress, predicted that Pappas would defy conventional wisdom as
he did four years ago, when many political writers treated him as
an afterthought. ``Conservatives feel so abused by the Republican
Party, they're going to come out in droves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who live in the narrow band that cuts across New Jersey's
midsection are, by and large, a contented lot. The 12th District,
which stretches on either side of U.S. Route 1, boasts the state's
best-educated and most prosperous residents. It includes the
gentleman-farmer estates of Hunterdon County, the new-money
McMansions of greater Princeton and the solidly middle-class towns
of East Brunswick, Holmdel and Freehold.
</P>
<P>
   With good schools, no cities and negligible crime, there is not
much to fire up the average voter. ``The only thing uniting the
district is that it contains most of the horse farms in the
state,'' said Steven Salmore, a Republican consultant.
</P>

   When they are not arguing over who was the better congressman,
the two candidates talk mostly about cutting taxes, fighting sprawl
and saving Social Security. Zimmer supports gun control and
abortion rights, although he recently switched his position on the
late-term procedure that critics call partial-birth abortion, which
he now opposes. His most widely recognized accomplishment in
Congress was a federal version of Megan's Law, the sex-offender
notification law.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas, who earned a 100-percent voting-record rating from the
Christian Coalition, wears his conservative credentials with pride.
He speaks proudly of his vote to impeach Clinton, and he held a
news conference earlier this month announcing his endorsement by
Phyllis Schlafly, president of the conservative Eagle Forum. He
agrees with the decision of the Boy Scouts of America to eject an
openly gay scoutmaster, an issue that Zimmer declined to weigh in
on. ``It's a very complicated matter,'' Zimmer said. ``I do,
however, oppose all forms of discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Newark and raised in a strongly Democratic working-class
family, Zimmer lives on an organic farm in Delaware Township, where
his wife raises sheep. Soft-spoken and bespectacled, Zimmer, 55,
hardly looks the part of the hungry politician. Supporters say he
is more comfortable drafting legislation than chatting with voters,
but those who remember his failed Senate race know he can give as
good as he gets. Even today, many Republicans shake their heads
when recalling the viciousness of that campaign. ``This time,''
Zimmer said, ``I'm just going to promote my record.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his opponent, Pappas, 39, is not much of a backslapper. He
spends some of his free time with the local 4-H club or a drug
prevention program for teen-agers. Before his election, he worked
for his family's insurance business.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Grimes, the Pappas campaign's youthful director, said an
outpouring of volunteer help had made up for the paucity of cash
and party support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a conscious decision not to sit around and make
fund-raising calls,'' he said. ``The proof is out there: if you
drive around the district, all you see are Pappas signs. You rarely
see a Zimmer sign.''
</P>
<P>
   He attributed Pappas' loss in 1998 to Holt's use of his
advertising dollars to tap into the anti-impeachment fury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess his passion got the best of him,'' Grimes said of
Pappas' singing on the House floor. ``Anyway, he's promised
everyone that from now on, he'll only sing in the shower.''

POLITICIANS PLAY THE STADIUM GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amazing, isn't it, how diligent politicians become when a local
sports team asks for public help in building the FleetCenter, a new
stadium in Foxborough, or another Fenway Park. All of a sudden they
know all of the numbers. Interest rates. Parking fees. Revenue
streams. Every minute detail. Where, however, were they for the Big
Dig? The new Convention Center? The South Boston Seaport and all of
the shenanigans that have taken place with those three major
city/state projects? Answer: Nowhere to be found. Here's the
difference: The politicans control the Big Dig, Convention Center,
and the Seaport, so when certain things go wrong they look the
other way. The don't want to know anything when ``it'' hits the fan
on those deals.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians don't control the sports teams, so they don't
get any of the gravy. What they get is a prime opportunity to
posture as the defenders of the public good. If you have a team,
and present your stadium plans, whether you own the Bruins,
Patriots, or Red Sox, you then have to dance the dance. The pols
will hold you at arm's length, squeeze you, waltz you around until
you are dizzy, and then when the music stops, will only help you if
they look good doing it. This is a way of life in Boston and
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Some 15 years ago, I was involved in running a retirement
weekend for Red Auerbach and much of it was devoted to raising
money for what is now known as the Red Auerbach Fund, which has
been highly successful. Along with others, I asked successful
Bostonians to donate $5,000 each in Red's name to start the fund.
One of them was one of the top pols of the day, who had a very
close relationship to Red. I visited him in his office on Beacon
Hill. I kept pitching him for the $5,000 and he kept ignoring me.
Finally I put it right on him. Yes or no. I'll never forget this as
long as I live. He looked at me and said with a smile, ``You don't
understand. I get the money. I don't give the money.'' He was
honest. The answer did not mean he did anything illegal. He had a
huge campaign war chest and could have taken the $5,000 out of
that. It just wasn't his policy to give anything away.
</P>
<P>
   In spring 1965, I stood in front of Tom Yawkey's desk for nearly
three hours one day, talking about the future of the Red Sox. The
team stunk. The next year they would draw a low of 620,000 in total
attendance. He talked about needing a new park, but didn't want
anything to do with politicians. ``You ask them for something, you
never get rid of them,'' was his line. Yawkey told me that day, and
I know it was true, he never made money with the team (he bought
the Red Sox and renovated the ballpark in 1932) and told his
general managers he didn't want to lose any more money, but he
didn't want to make a profit, either. He told them if the team made
any money, to spend it on the team.
</P>
<P>
   The Yawkey name has been attached to the Red Sox for 68 years.
Neither he nor his widow, Jean, who controlled the team until 10
years ago, ever took a cent out of the ball club. When Tom Yawkey
died in 1976, he left a trust that to this day spins out $2 million
or better a year, some 70 percent going to Massachusetts-based
charities. The man was not a local native and he didn't live here.
Yet, he left the bulk of his charitable money to Massachusetts and
Boston. When he died, his wife established Yawkey II. That also
spins out money each year, primarily to Boston and
Massachusetts-based charities. In her will, she said he wanted the
Red Sox and Fenway Park sold for the highest amount possible, and
all of that money would go into Yawkey II.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when the politicians of today talk revenue streams, this is
what they don't want to see. If, for example, in a new ballpark,
the team sold for $600 million, which would be about the range in
today's economy, 55 percent of that money _ or more than $300
million _ would go into Yawkey II.
</P>
<P>
   The Yawkey Trusts have been giving away money each year to
charities at a rate between 5 and 10 percent of the money in the
trust. At this rate, Yawkey II alone, each year, for the lifetime
of this planet, would spin out anywhere from $15 million-$30
million a year to charity, some 70 percent going to
Massachusetts-based charities.
</P>
<P>
   Now the city and the state say they want some money back on the
collective $270 million the Red Sox are seeking to build a new
park. In 10 years, they would have a minimum of $150 million back.
In 50 years, they would have $750 million back. In the next
millennium, they would have $1.5 billion back from Yawkey II.
</P>
<P>
   They know this. But they don't want to see it because they can't
control the charity. No jobs. No patronage. No taking credit.
</P>
<P>
   So let's put together how much money the Red Sox have brought to
the city of Boston and the state in the last 100 years, with the
money the Yawkey Trusts would bring in the next 100 years, and see
if it covers the $270 million investment.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it does. But the politicians don't want to see that.
It's not about them. It can't help get them votes or run for a
higher office. They can't take credit for what the Yawkeys have
done for this community. And without some benefit coming to them
personally, they're not going to let it happen.
</P>
<P>
   The state's House speaker, Tom Finneran, said this week there
are plenty of people in this community who would love to buy the
team and build a new park privately. Find them, Mr. Speaker. Line
them up. Have them put the money on the table. For $500 million, it
will be all theirs in a heartbeat. John Harrington, CEO of the Red
Sox and the head of Yawkey Trust, is on record with this. Call his
bluff.

   Two local products could be taken in the top 10 in the National
Hockey League draft, to be held in Calgary June 23-24. This will be
the first time the NHL has had a two-day draft, and no doubt it's
for television. Boston University goalie Rick DiPietro and Boston
College defenseman Brooks Orpik are in the top 10 on several lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both considered outstanding prospects,'' said Bruins
assistant general manager Mike O'Connell. ``There will be a heavy
emphasis on the European players. It has been proven over time that
the top players are coming from there. Just look at the best
players in our league. The Europeans are highly skilled and have
proven they can handle the physical aspect of our game. Four
Russians are rated among the top five in Europe, and overall, you
could see 20 of the first 30 players taken be from Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have the option of taking Colorado's first pick this
year or waiting for next season, as part of the Ray Bourque trade.
``We won't make that decision until the pick is on the board,''
said O'Connell. ``If there is someone there we like, we can take
it. If not, we might be able to use it to move around in the
draft.'' O'Connell thinks there'll be fewer deals than usual around
draft time this season because of the impending expansion draft for
Minnesota and Columbus. The Bruins will protect two goalies in the
draft, likely John Grahame, who was magnificent for Providence in
the AHL playoffs, and Byron Dafoe.

   Things are not always greener in the Land of the Rising Sun.
Former Red Sox players Lou Merloni (Framingham) and Reggie
Jefferson have not fared well in Japan. In midweek, Merloni was 9
for 46 (.196) with a homer and two RBIs. Jefferson, who ran out on
the Red Sox in the playoffs last year, is hitting a robust .225

   Class Act. On the same day, Julius Erving flew from Orlando,
Fla., where he is working with the Magic, to Boston and back again,
just to play in University of Massachusetts president Bill Bulger's
golf tournament. Erving's presence helped raise $85,000 for
Bulger's Honors Program, which specifies that the money go toward
keeping top state high school seniors by providing scholarships at
UMass. Incidentally, the Patriots and New York Giants are closing a
deal that would have the teams practice against each other in
McGuirk Stadium July 9. There will be tickets for the 17,000-seat
facility, but none will be sold. Admission will be free.
Patriots-Giants will bang the place out.

   Sad to hear that Rocket Richard, one of the great athletes of
our time, is very sick in Montreal. Even though he was the star on
the greatest hockey teams ever, the Canadiens of the 1950s, Rocket
never got his due in this country because he was based in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the man responsible for so many of those championships
they won,'' said Bruins legend Milt Schmidt, who faced the Rocket
in so many great duels. ``Rocket is the best I have ever seen from
the blue line to the net. Absolutely the best. He was very strong,
tough to take out of the play. He had a great burst with the puck.
I asked our goaltender, Don Simmons, once what he thought about
when he saw Rocket coming over the blue line. Simmons said it
looked like a 16-ton truck bearing down on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember I was coaching against Montreal in the playoffs and
we had a good guy named Larry Regan on our club. I told Larry
before the game, whatever you do tonight, don't get farther than 3
feet away from Rocket at any time. I don't care if you ever touch
the puck in this game, just keep him from scoring. Rocket scored
two goals in the first period. In the dressing room I start going
after Larry. I ask him how he could let it happen. Rocket scored
two goals and he made it look easy. Larry said, ``He gets paid
twice what I get paid, so he should make it look easy.'' That shut
me up. Everyone in the room started laughing. One of the greatest
achievements in our league was Rocket scoring 50 goals in 50 games,
when everyone in the league was trying to stop him.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Bruin player and coach Tom Johnson was a teammate of
Rocket's during the glory years in Montreal. ``Rocket was the most
intense athlete I have ever been around,'' he said. ``He was the
star of the league. Because of this, he had to be somewhat of a
loner when we went on the road. When we came to a town, Rocket sold
the building out. I saw him deck two players from Toronto in the
same fight, with just two punches. Boom. Boom. He had a tremendous
flair for the game. He always drew special attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The group we had on the power play in those days changed the
rules. Back then, if you got a penalty, you had to stay in the
penalty box until the (entire penalty time was served). We had
Rocket, (Bernie) Geoffrion, (Jean) Beliveau, (Doug) Harvey, and
sometimes Dickie Moore, who led the league in scoring a couple of
years, all on the power play. One night we were playing the Bruins
and one of their guys got a two-minute penalty. Before he got out
of the box, Jean Beliveau scored a hat trick in less than two
minutes. The next year, at the league meeting, Lynn Patrick, the
general manager of the Bruins, made a proposal to change the rule,
so that when a goal was scored, the guy got out of the penalty box.
That's what caused the change.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Don't look for either Bruce Armstrong or Ben Coates, two of the
best to ever play for the Patriots, to be back with the team this
season. At the start of free agency in February, when both refused
to take salary cuts, I said they were making a mistake. Armstrong
didn't agree. The Patriots offered Armstrong $2 million for this
year and Coates $1.5 million. Both said no thanks. On Thursday,
most teams will have to cut veteran players to get under the salary
cap to make room for signing their draft choices. At that point,
the money for a veteran player with five years in the league is
$440,000. If either of them receives an offer from another team,
and there's no counting on that, they still won't get the money
they would have received if they re-signed here.
</P>
<P>
   USA Today published salary figures for each player and team. The
Patriots had the highest payroll in the league in '99 at $56.6
million. Former Patriot Sam Gash, who was cut for salary-cap
reasons in Buffalo, says if he doesn't get an offer before the
season, he will enroll in law school.

   In a recent profile, former Cowboys star and Hall of Famer Roger
Staubach was asked: ``Person whom you emulate most (outside of your
family).'' Answer: ``Father Joseph Ryan, former Navy Captain, one
of my closest friends, and father figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Father Ryan is a Milton native who befriended Roger nearly 40
years ago at the Naval Academy. Father Ryan passes along this
story. ``Roger recently was invited to the opening of a restaurant
in Washington. Joe Theismann challenged him to a ``throwing
contest.'' The restaurant had a game that involved throwing
footballs at moving targets for 90 seconds while accumulating
points. Joe was the reigning champion. He had a 97 out of a
possible 150. Roger scored 120, and said it felt great as a Cowboy
to come into Redskin country, where the people in the restaurant
gave him a standing ovation hen the game was over.''

   SUMMER-FILMS (Undated) _ Like death and taxes some things never

example, and they're much better-known pieces of criticism. And
most of the great heroes of the music have been powerhouse

   TAKE-FO-MUSIC (New Orleans) _ By all means, this should have
been the time for Take Fo' to explode into the mainstream. The
music it popularized, a salacious, booty-shaking regional dance
music called bounce, has in the last year fueled some of hip-hop's
biggest hits. On radio stations around the country, every fan of
urban pop was dancing to Earl Mackie's music. Only they didn't know
it was his. By Neil Strauss.

   KATEY-RED-MUSIC (New Orleans) _ Katey Red may be one of the
first openly homosexual rap and bounce-music artist to earn respect

have a most unlikely regional star, even in a city with a rich

Humans, unlike Greek gods and new operas, enter the world helpless

unprepared. The new piece happens all at once and fully formed. It

dinosaurs and woolly mammoths manage to compete with Regis Philbin
in popularity without giving away money? According to Dr. James
Powell, the head of Los Angeles County's Natural History Museum
Foundation, their appeal, especially to children, may be related to
their enormous size. ``They are fantastic, as in creatures of

 &HT;    South Africa head honors King, activists
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ South African President Thabo Mbeki took the pulpit in
Atlanta's historic Ebenezer Baptist Church on Friday to acknowledge
the debt South Africa's freedom fighters owe to the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. and to declare common cause between Africans who
still live on the continent and those in the diaspora.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki was escorted into the church by Martin Luther King III, a
son of the famous civil rights leader. Mbeki, standing in the spot
where the elder King delivered many sermons _ and with King's
widow, Corretta Scott King, sitting behind him _ said King's
teachings and eloquence inspired black people in South Africa as
they fought to end apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. King was one of the first world leaders to call for a
boycott of South Africa,'' Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
   Retired South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who spoke before
Mbeki, also paid homage to the encouragement given 30 and 40 years
ago by civil rights leaders from Atlanta to oppressed blacks in
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Martin Luther King said, `I have a dream,' we dreamt the
dream with him,'' Tutu said.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki's two-day stop in Atlanta was part of a trip that began in
Washington, where he was entertained at the White House by Harry
Belafonte, Stevie Wonder and others. It was Mbeki's first visit to
Washington since succeeding Nelson Mandela as president last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Mbeki and Clinton held talks on AIDS prevention
and treatment in South Africa, where one person in 10 is affected
by the disease. Mbeki also made a speech at Georgetown University
in which he warned that the global trend toward democracy and free
markets could be imperiled unless the crushing poverty that
afflicts much of the world is eased.
</P>
<P>
   Having met in Washington with Vice President Al Gore, the
presumed Democratic nominee for president this fall, Mbeki met
Thursday in Austin with Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who will be the
Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki's speech in Atlanta Friday, his final day in the United
States, was attended by, among others, Gov. Roy Barnes and Atlanta
Mayor Bill Campbell, who also noted the historic and spiritual
connections between the city and South Africa. ``Atlanta stands in
a symbiotic relationship with the Republic of South Africa,'' the
mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   The South African president, who is a British-educated
economist, thanked Atlantans for having invested in South Africa in
the past, and urged them to do more as the country works to build
its economy and recover from the legacy of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need your skills, your expertise, your investment,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The country's leaders have set themselves the challenge of
ensuring that the 21st century is ``an African century,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new century still shows signs of racism, evidenced by the
rise of xenophobia in Europe and the recent spate of hate crimes in
the United States, Mbeki said. He said people must work together to
make sure that the ``color problem'' _ which the scholar W.E.B.
Dubois warned 100 years ago would define the 20th century _ is
solved in the 21st, once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   In that effort, he called for continued cooperation between the
people of Georgia and those of South Africa. ``The people of South
Africa are with you, not only at the resting place of Dr. King, but
always and at all times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After speaking at Ebenezer Baptist Church, Mbeki visited King's
tomb, then went to CNN for a live television interview.

ONTARIO INVESTIGATES E. COLI OUTBREAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Police in Ontario launched an investigation Friday to
determine whether criminal negligence is responsible for one of the
deadliest outbreaks of E. coli bacterial infection ever in North
America.
</P>
<P>
   The epidemic, blamed on contaminated water in the public system
of the small farming town of Walkerton, has already killed five
people, including an infant, and made more than 1,000 terribly ill.
Four small children remained in critical condition Friday night on
kidney dialysis machines and other life support systems.
</P>
<P>
   Local physicians, including the public health chief for the
afflicted rural region in southwestern Ontario, have accused
officials responsible for the water system of failing to warn
residents against drinking the water even after receiving lab
reports that the supply was dangerously contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have prevented all these deaths,'' said Dr. Murray
McQuigge, a Harvard-trained public health officer who repeatedly
raised concerns about the safety of Walkerton's water supply as
area residents started falling ill last week.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at the regional Health Sciences Center in London,
Ontario, where the most severely-afflicted children were rushed by
helicopter, said that more deaths are probable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never lost a child to this before,'' said Dr. Douglas
Matsell, chief pediatric kidney specialist at the hospital, shortly
after a 2-year-old died of E. coli infection. ``We have children in
intensive care who are not getting better. They are getting worse.
. . . I worry that there will be more deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak showed signs of turning into a major
public-sanitation scandal as provincial politicians called for
commissions of inquiry and high-powered lawyers by the droves
flocked to Walkerton in anticipation of lawsuits against muncipal
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   E. coli is a usually benign bacteria that thrives in the human
digestive tract without harmful effect. But a dangerous strain of
the germ, known as Escherichia 0157:H7, can wreak havoc on humans,
causing cramps, diarrhea, vomiting and, in the most severe
infections, kidney failure and death. There is no effective
treatment other than drinking lots of fluids and letting the
infection run its course.
</P>
<P>
   Most E. coli infections are caused by tainted food, often
hamburger. But the dangerous strain is also found in cow manure and
authorities believe that the runoff from farm fields washed into
Walkerton's public water supplies during heavy rains and flooding
in the middle of May.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the germs should have been killed by the chlorination
process that is routine for water systems. But the machine that
injects the chemical into Walkerton's system was broken, although
the public was apparently not advised.
</P>
<P>
   McQuigge said that utility officials disregarded repeated
warnings that the water was contaminated for at least five days
after lab reports showed dangerous levels of E. coli germs. The
parttime chairman of the tiny Public Utility Commission, James
Kieffer, declined comment, predicting the issue will eventually
come to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The Ontario Provincial Police on Friday issued only a terse
statement. ``We are conducting an investigation into the
circumstances surrounding the contamination of the water in
Walkerton,'' said a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak represents the deadliest E. coli epidemic in
Canadian history and possibly the worst in North America linked to
public drinking water in modern times. The last major E. coli
eruption was a 1993 outbreak caused by tainted hamburger meat
served by Jack-in-the-Box restaurants in the state of Washington.

providers, UnitedHealthcare, against Texas officials who have
proposed disciplining one of the company's medical directors, the
influential behind-the-scenes officials who decide whether to pay
for patient treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome could have important consequences: If the state
prevails in court and this kind of disciplinary action spreads, one
of the basic premises of managed care _ that insurers can contain
costs by wielding an effective veto over frontline doctors'
treatment decisions _ could be hampered by state medical boards
third-guessing the insurers' second-guessing. A decision in favor
of UnitedHealthcare, on the other hand, could deflect growing
efforts by many state boards to hold HMOs accountable for treatment
decisions, physician groups say.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas case stems from a UnitedHealthcare medical director's
decision two years ago not to approve coverage of at-home skilled
nursing care for a 13-year-old boy, David Wiser, who had spent five
weeks hospitalized after suffering respiratory failure. The boy's
doctor called the treatment ``medically necessary,'' but the
medical director said it was ``custodial care'' and not covered by
the insurance plan. In January, officials at the Texas State Board
of Medical Examiners found that by denying coverage the medical
director failed to provide proper care.
</P>
<P>
   The facts of the case are not novel, but one question it raises
is: Does a 26-year-old federal pension law, which managed care
companies frequently use to beat down lawsuits by patients, also
shield their medical decision-makers from state regulation? A dozen
states have recently approved rules requiring HMO medical directors
to be physicians licensed in the state where their health plan
resides, and thus subject to oversight by state medical boards;
nine more require them to be licensed, but not necessarily in that
state.
</P>
<P>
   The issue goes to the heart of the debate in Congress over
whether injured patients should be able to take legal action
against health maintenance organizations and other managed care
companies that improperly deny care. The industry has long used
provisions of the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act,
known as Erisa, to fight off patient lawsuits; the 1974 law limits
state-court actions against benefit plans, including claims for
wrongful death or injury. Federal courts lately have chipped away
at Erisa's shield, but UnitedHealthcare contends in the Dallas case
that the law nonetheless bars state officials from taking action
against medical directors and other employees who approve or deny
coverage of treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The case also highlights another important question in the
patients' rights debate: What it is, exactly, that HMOs and other
managed care companies are doing when they deny treatment _ are
they making a simple administrative decision about benefits, or are
they, as physicians' groups contend, effectively practicing
medicine, substituting their own judgment for that of the attending
doctor?
</P>
<P>
   ``The physicians who direct treatment need to be accountable to
the public for their conduct,'' said Dr. James Winn, executive vice
president of the Federation of State Medical Boards, in Euless,
Texas. ``Doctors shouldn't be able to claim a safe harbor simply
because they work for an insurance company. I expect to see more
and more litigation coming as a result of this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry and its crusade to rein in health care costs are
already beset by lawsuits and legislative threats from all
directions. On top of proposals in Congress and the states'
efforts, a wave of class-action lawsuits has been filed against
managed care plans, based on claims that the plans have
systematically defrauded and shortchanged patients by limiting
care. The California Medical Association opened a new front last
week when it filed a civil racketeering suit against three
managed-care companies, accusing them of ``using coercive, unfair
and fraudulent means to dominate and control the physician-patient
relationship for their own financial gain.'' An industry spokesman
called the suit a groundless ``shotgun attack on managed care.''
</P>
<P>
   As pressures on the industry have grown, some companies have
eased up. UnitedHealthcare, a unit of UnitedHealth Group based in
Minneapolis, announced in November that it has given up most
second-guessing of medical-necessity decisions made by patients'
doctors, though they will still reject procedures that they
determine are not covered by individual health plans.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Dallas case, Louis Saccoccio, general counsel of the
American Association of Health Plans, said state officials are
trying to second-guess a benefit-coverage call, something they have
no authority to do. ``The board of medical examiners is getting
involved in what is basically a benefit or coverage
determination,'' he said. ``It's a concern for health plans and it
would be a concern for medical directors, and it would be a concern
for employers and consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Silverstein, UnitedHealthcare's chief marketing officer,
said, ``The fundamental issue is that our medical director was
making a benefit decision on behalf of an employer,'' he said. ``It
was never a question of medical necessity.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: This is not an HMO ``horror story,'' with
a victim who allegedly never got proper treatment and a plaintiffs'
lawyer dragging a deep-pocketed insurer before a jury. In fact,
David Wiser's home care bills wound up being paid by another arm of
UnitedHealthcare, and while the boy died a few months after leaving
the hospital, no one has alleged that his death was related to the
treatments at the center of the dispute. His parents, Mark and
Sherrel Wiser, do not stand to gain monetarily from the outcome.
They decided to pursue the matter, Wiser said, because of how
shaken they were when UnitedHealthcare initially declined coverage;
they say they hope to spare other parents the ordeal they went
through.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of April 27, 1998, Wiser was taking David to
school as usual when the boy, who was paralyzed, suffered from
scoliosis, and had a long history of respiratory and other serious
illnesses, became lethargic and his breathing grew labored.
</P>
<P>
   Wiser rushed his son to Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort
Worth, a half-hour away. David suffered respiratory failure there
and was put on a ventilator. He remained in the hospital for five
weeks, much of the time in intensive care, as doctors weaned him
off round-the-clock ventilator care to the point where he could
breathe on his own much of the day.
</P>
<P>
   By June, David's physician, Dr. Sami K.W. Hadeed, a pediatric
pulmonologist, was prepared to discharge him. But Hadeed wanted
David to use a ventilator at home and be looked after by home care
nurses. Hadeed wrote: ``Although David will be going home with
mechanical ventilatory support at night, it is hoped that he will
be able to do some additional vent weaning in the future and may,
in fact, be able to come entirely off the ventilator again at some
point.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The family's primary health insurance was Wiser's coverage under
her employer's self-funded plan administered by UnitedHealthcare's
Dallas office. But one of the three Dallas medical directors at
UnitedHealthcare balked at paying for the skilled nursing treatment
Hadeed ordered.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents drawn up by the Texas State Board of
Medical Examiners as part of a proposed settlement of the case, the
medical director based his decision on a 15- to 20-minute telephone
conversation with Hadeed, plus two to three hours of discussions
with other UnitedHealthcare staff members. The medical director _
who is not named in court filings but is identified in documents
provided by Wiser as Dr. David William Ellis _ had no experience
with home ventilator care and did not consult medical literature in
making his decision, according to the document.
</P>
<P>
   UnitedHealthcare contends that Hadeed's treatment order was
outside the scope of Wiser's insurance because it was custodial
care. Rather than working ``towards resolution of a specific health
problem,'' UnitedHealthcare's lawsuit against the state board
states, Hadeed indicated that the treatment would supplement ``the
care that would otherwise be provided by his family'' and that
``the purpose of these services appeared to be to provide respite
to the parents.'' Hadeed did not return a phone call seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Wisers also had secondary insurance: Wiser had coverage
through a plan that, as it happens, was administered by
UnitedHealthcare's California subsidiary. That plan agreed to pay
for the at-home treatment after using an independent medical
reviewer to assess David's condition, Wiser said. The reviewer
concluded that ``David is very fragile medically and physically''
and authorized at least 16 hours a day of skilled nursing at home,
according to a copy of the report provided by Wiser. The report
continued: ``In Texas, a patient cannot be cared for by unskilled
caregivers if he is not stable or predictable. David certainly
falls in the unstable and unpredictable categories.''
</P>
<P>
   David was discharged from the hospital and received the care
Hadeed ordered, his father said. But David suffered problems
throughout that summer, Wiser said, and in September he died from a
brain aneurysm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no anger toward Dr. Ellis,'' Wiser said of the medical
director who refused to approve treatment. But Wiser complained to
state officials anyway _ ``hopefully to see some justice done, and
hopefully to prevent something similar'' from happening to others,
he said. ``This is the law that's on the books in the state of
Texas, and I'm simply exercising what is legally my right. They're
the ones who are suing.''
</P>
<P>
   Silverstein of UnitedHealthcare said the case record shows that
his company made the proper decisions at each stage. Those calls
were strictly over what was covered, not medical necessity, he said
_ Wiser's plan did not cover the treatments but Wiser's did. He
added that the company ``fully supports our medical director.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One employer purchased a certain set of benefits, and another
employer didn't,'' Silverstein said. ``Those decisions are part of
a contract between insurers and employers, and employers and
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Physicians' groups say the line between medical judgments and
benefits determinations is not so easily drawn, and that insurers
invoke it arbitrarily to suit themselves. Any time a managed care
official ``inappropriately makes a decision, then all of a sudden
it's not a medical decision, it's a coverage decision,'' complained
Connie Barron, associate director of legislative affairs for the
Texas Medical Association, in Austin. ``Whichever will get them out
of accountability is what they will claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Although David's bills were ultimately paid, Wiser said he
remained disturbed that the treatment had at first been denied, and
he feared what would have happened had his wife's insurance plan
been all they had. Then he recalled an article he had read on a
plane about an Arizona case in which medical officials had slapped
the wrist of a managed-care medical director after a surgeon
complained that the doctor had improperly denied coverage of a
patient's gallbladder surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The Wisers filed a complaint with the Texas state medical board.
In January, after considering the complaint for more than a year,
board officials found that when Ellis disallowed David's home
treatment, he was engaging in the practice of medicine and had
``failed to meet the standard of care,'' according to papers filed
by UnitedHealthcare when it sued the board. To settle the matter,
the board proposed that Ellis pay a $5,000 fine and accept a public
reprimand and a two-year ``probated suspension'' of his medical
license _ he could continue to practice but would be required to
complete 12 hours of home ventilator training and meet other
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, who did not return a telephone call seeking comment,
could have accepted the proposed settlement or appealed to a state
administrative law judge. Instead, UnitedHealthcare sued the state
medical board in March. The board's disciplinary action against
Ellis is in abeyance awaiting the outcome of the suit; a hearing is
scheduled in Dallas before U.S. District Court Judge Barbara M.G.
Lynn next month.
</P>
<P>
   State actions against managed care medical directors are rare,
but there have been some significant past cases, including a 1995
case in Rhode Island and the 1997 case in Arizona that caught
Wiser's attention. There, the state Court of Appeals upheld the
authority of the state Board of Medical Examiners to issue a
``letter of concern'' _ a mild rebuke _ to a medical director at
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona regarding his ``inappropriate
medical decision which could have caused harm to a patient.'' The
patient went ahead with the gall bladder operation that the medical
director had refused to approve, and tests afterward demonstrated
that the procedure had in fact been necessary. Blue Cross then paid
the bill, but the patient's surgeon complained to the state board.
</P>
<P>
   There is no Texas law requiring medical directors to be
state-licensed physicians; instead, the state medical board, which
is appointed by the governor, issued a position statement three
years ago stating that anyone making a decision ``so as to effect
the diagnosis or treatment of a patient in Texas'' must possess a
state license or risk criminal prosecution. According to the
Federation of State Medical Boards, 16 states now explicitly
require HMO medical directors to be licensed physicians in the
state where the health plan resides; most of those rules were
enacted in the past two years, including new laws in California,
North Carolina and Virginia, according to the group. Nine more
states require medical directors to have valid physician's
licenses, but not necessarily from that state.
</P>
<P>
   But similar legislation has been turned back in other states
recently. In Ohio, the state attorney general concluded last year
that under current law, reviews of medical necessity by health
insurance providers did not amount to the practice of medicine and
were beyond the disciplinary reach of the state medical board.
</P>
<P>
   To Texas officials, it does not matter what you call it: Making
decisions that affect medical care is the practice of medicine,
plain and simple. Refusing to pay for skilled nursing at home for
David included ``a determination of whether the services of a
health care professional are required,'' the Texas attorney
general's office said in its motion to dismiss the UnitedHealthcare
lawsuit against the medical board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is more critical to the regulation of health care than
the regulation of medical decision-making,'' the motion stated.
``It is for the board, not an insurance company, to decide if
medical judgment was exercised by a physician and if that judgment
was exercised appropriately.''

NEWCOMER IS FEELING AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Joey Franchino, the Revolution's newest addition _ from
Los Angeles _ is acclimating to New England. In fact, Franchino has
reason to feel settled on the East Coast, since this is where his
family's roots were planted.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather was from Northern Italy and he landed at Ellis
Island,'' Franchino said Friday. ``He lived in New York before
moving to Los Angeles. If he hadn't declared US citizenship, I
would have qualified for Italian citizenship. It's something I
checked into, just in case I wanted to play in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Revolution coach Fernando Clavijo was concerned about
Franchino's transition. ``Did he really want to come to the East
Coast? Would he be happy here? He knows the guys and he fit in
right away, like he has been here forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchino, 23, began playing soccer in Southern California when
he was 5. He was a member of the Los Angeles Galaxy until last
week, when he was sent to the Revolution. New England has won both
games Franchino has played. Less than 24 hours after Franchino
arrived, the Revolution won at Chicago, 1-0, last Saturday, then
edged the Galaxy, 2-1, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transition has been easy for me,'' Franchino said. ``It's
my job now to work hard and fight for these guys. It was very
satisfying to beat LA. I was upset at first, but now I look at it
as an opportunity to step up and bring my game to a different
level; I am working every day to make that happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against LA, our guys were fighting and working for 90 minutes
from front to back and that is something you very rarely see with
LA. They are a bunch of superstars and they don't all want to work
defensively all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``But LA has players who are winners and they are going to
bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchino kept a low profile with the Galaxy. But if the
Revolution continue to succeed, Franchino could become more
prominent. He is the oldest starter in the defense _ his birthday
(Aug. 9, 1976) just misses the cutoff date to be an Olympic team
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a hell of a player on the left side,'' said Clavijo.
``He knows his limitations and he has good work habits. He still
can improve. But it is hard to find a good left-side player, and
with (Franchino), it is allowing Ted Chronopoulos to be more
free.''
</P>
<P>
   Chronopoulos converted both Revolution goals and Franchino
helped limit Cobi Jones against Los Angeles.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ In November, more than 100 employees of
Calico Commerce were millionaires, at least on paper.
</P>
<P>
   Today only 20 are. As Calico's stock has fallen 80 percent from
its November peak, the rest have watched their fleeting wealth burn
away like fog in the California sun. In April alone, Calico shares
lost nearly half their value.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, where job hopping is a way of life and even
robust companies regularly lose workers to start-ups dangling
chances at instant wealth, a stock meltdown like Calico's might
seem a recipe for disaster, prompting top employees to flee and
crippling morale among those who remain.
</P>
<P>
   But Calico, which makes software that helps companies sell
products over the Internet, has weathered the storm so far, thanks
to an intangible commodity that is supposedly even scarcer around
here than out-of-work software engineers: the striking loyalty of
its workers.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, only 15 of Calico's 330 workers have left the
company. That translates into an annual rate of 12 percent, barely
half the typical turnover at Silicon Valley companies, according to
Steve Radford, who has surveyed salaries and turnover at
high-technology companies for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Calico's stability is no accident, employees say. While many
Silicon Valley companies depend largely on the promise of riches to
attract and retain workers, Calico has gone a different route,
using more than money to keep employees happy. The company tries to
combine the openness and workplace perks common in Silicon Valley
companies with the very uncommon understanding that employees
sometimes have lives outside the office.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the mix seems to be working. From Alan Naumann, Calico's
chief executive, to Aleida Kolodzieski, an administrative
assistant, employees interviewed at Calico's headquarters in San
Jose last month said they believed in their company, whatever the
stock market might think.
</P>
<P>
   Of course they say that, a cynic might interject. But many
Calico employees have put their money where their mouths are.
</P>
<P>
   In March, five months after the company went public,
restrictions on insider stock sales expired and Calico workers were
free to sell shares and turn their paper wealth into cash. Few did.
In fact, Naumann actually spent more than $2 million in late April
to buy 150,000 shares on the open market, building his total stake
in the company to 1.65 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Schwartz, a 29-year-old manager who was Calico's 13th
employee and has been with the company since 1995, said he shared
that confidence. With more than 5,000 options, Schwartz lost more
than $300,000 in paper wealth as Calico's stock price shriveled.
Yet he remains a believer. ``I would encourage my parents to buy,
my best friends to buy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A strong company culture only goes so far, and even Naumann
admits that his company will eventually start losing people if the
stock price remains depressed. And it is hard to forecast what the
immediate future holds for the company. Its products compete in a
hotly contested market niche against offerings from specialists
like FirePond and giants like Oracle. Though Calico's sales have
grown steadily at 70 percent annually or better, reaching $35.6
million in the year ended March 31, its losses have widened as
well, to $27.8 million _ a new-economy story that investors used to
shrug off but now have little patience for.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Calico's efforts to make its employees feel like partners
seem for the moment to have cushioned the blow of the stock slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between good and bad management teams in the
valley is their ability to manage through the natural ebb and flow
of the business,'' said Roger McNamee, a venture capitalist whose
investment funds own more than 5 percent of Calico. ``This is a
management team that understands the business that they're in. They
made a conscious choice to run the business for the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   That choice makes Calico unusual _ and could help the company
prosper over time, management consultants said.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that employees and companies have a social contract
with each other that goes beyond a paycheck has largely vanished in
United States business. In its place is a free-agent culture where
workers are expected to look out for themselves and switching jobs
regularly is seen as normal.
</P>
<P>
   But a few big companies, like Cisco Systems, Southwest Airlines
and Men's Wearhouse, have found success by going out of their way
to make employees feel valued, according to Charles O'Reilly, a
Harvard professor who is writing a book about the cultures of
successful companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average point of view is that loyalty is for chumps, that
the longer you stay on the job, the stupider you are,'' said Fred
Reichheld, a fellow at Bain Consulting who is writing a book about
loyalty. ``Most business leaders cannot tell you why their people
should be loyal. They get it confused with obedience, or just
staying there, or fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, companies often try to combat turnover with big
salaries and option grants. But Reichheld said that approach is
self-defeating, because it works only as long as times are good and
an organization can afford to pay a fairly small roster of stars
above-market salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Being honest with employees and giving them a chance to grow at
their jobs builds loyalty in a way that money cannot, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Naumann appears to have taken that lesson to heart. He shares
lots of information with employees, holding monthly company-wide
meetings to discuss where Calico stands relative to its competitors
and internal goals. In addition, he hosts a monthly group breakfast
for employees whose birthdays have fallen that month and solicits
feedback from the group. That level of disclosure and communication
is vital to building loyalty, O'Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The all-too-typical MBA response is that people can't be
trusted, and they're not very smart, so why would you give them
this information?'' he said. But companies that keep workers well
informed find that employees come to feel they have a stake in the
company, even if they own only a little stock. ``Then people feel
like owners, and they stick around even if the stock price dips,''
O'Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Calico is not alone in fostering an atmosphere of
openness. Young companies often share more information with their
employees than bigger, older businesses; the gulf between
management and the rank and file tends to widen over time. And some
of Calico's other perks, like allowing employees to telecommute
twice a week, are typical at young Silicon Valley companies where
employees put in long hours.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   But Calico does differ from its young cousins in some crucial
ways. With weak or nonexistent human resources departments and a
culture that puts work first, many young companies stumble when
dealing with employees having personal crises. Not at Calico, said
Rob Devine, a 32-year-old consultant who joined the company in
June, six months before his wife died of ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leadership two and three levels above was completely fair'' in
its treatment of him, Devine said. As his wife's health worsened,
he said, the company arranged his work to minimize travel and
offered him extra time off, an offer he declined because, he said,
``it's important when you're in a situation like that to have
something where you feel you're contributing.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelly Begun, Calico's vice president for human resources, said
the company allowed an employee whose wife gave birth prematurely
more than two months' leave to help care for the baby. ``It is a
huge deal for people that, when they have these types of
situations, Calico will help to deal with them,'' Begun said.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy McDermand, a manager whose grant of more than 10,000
options has just begun to vest, said she had recently turned down a
job at a start-up that offered her ``lots of shares'' and more
money, preferring to remain at Calico for its collegial atmosphere.
``If it weren't like that, I could leave tomorrow,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To maintain that spirit, Calico has made a concerted effort to
seek out employees considered likely to fit into its culture,
placing a premium on recruiting graduates directly from college or
business school.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard and other successful technology companies ``do
superaggressive college hiring, because it's the only way to get
people who fit in,'' said Naumann, an Iowa native who worked for
Hewlett-Packard for five years after graduating from college.
``We're trying to do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, though, this is still Silicon Valley, the
overnight-millionaire factory. Most Calico employees acknowledge
forthrightly that tantalizing stock windfalls like those that were
briefly within their grasp are a large part of what brought to
Calico to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential money that could be made getting into a company
pre-IPO really was a big consideration,'' said John Driver,
Calico's director of field marketing.
</P>
<P>
   So too, for many people in Silicon Valley, are bragging rights,
and Calico's stock no longer yields employees much of those.
``There is a gold rush mentality'' in the new economy, said Barry
Obrand, managing director of Russell Reynolds Associates, the
executive recruiting firm. ``For people who haven't made it in some
way, shape or form, there's a sense that you haven't done as well
for yourself or your family.''
</P>
<P>
   Yuri Smirov, an engineer who joined Calico last year after two
years at a privately held start-up, looks at Calico's prospects
through that lens. Working for a company that does not succeed is
extremely costly in Silicon Valley, he said, because ``time is
becoming the most expensive resource.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is something you lose and it doesn't come back,'' Smirov
said.
</P>
<P>
   Smirov, who emigrated to the United States from Russia in 1992
and earned a doctorate in computer science at Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh, said moving from Russia to Pennsylvania
was a smaller adjustment for him than moving from Pennsylvania to
Silicon Valley. The people he met in Pittsburgh were white and
middle-class, with ``the same income, with the same interests,'' he
said. ``Here, people are stratified much more.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the stock, he said, ``the hardest part is mismatching
your expectations.'' Smirov, who will receive more than 25,000
options between now and 2003, used to think he would be able to buy
a house large enough for his two children to have separate
bedrooms. That prospect is now remote, but Smirov remains hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   Housing is on the mind of Kolodzieski, the administrator with
only ``a couple of thousand shares,'' as well. She and her husband
hope one day to move out of the condominium apartment they rent.
``We want to have a family, and part of that equals buying a
home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Naumann knows his staff's patience will not last forever. ``Our
total compensation packages have to be competitive, or we won't
retain people,'' he said. But for now, the stock woes have, if
anything, pulled the company closer together, he said. ``The
market's got it wrong, and we're just going to have to prove them
wrong.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Katherine Crockett's body began to shake when she
hung up the telephone on Thursday night after learning that the
Martha Graham Dance Company was suspending activity indefinitely
because of financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my life,'' Crockett, a leading dancer with the troupe,
said Friday afternoon as she arrived for the last scheduled class
at the school the company operates in the East Village. ``This
company is everything I have and everything I am. I came because I
had to say goodbye. There can be no closure. Martha's work is
timeless. You can close it, but there can be no closure.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to suspend operations, including the school and the
company's junior troupe, in the face of dire financial problems was
made at a board meeting on Thursday afternoon. Ron Protas, whom
Graham had chosen to direct the company after her death in 1991,
abstained from the otherwise unanimous vote. In reaction to the
board's decision, Protas, who licenses Graham's dances as the
director of the Martha Graham Trust and who has been feuding with
the board over the company's direction, withdrew permission for the
works to be performed by the troupe. Robert Solomon, a trustee and
the lawyer representing the company, said the troupe was contesting
the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The company was flooded with calls of support Friday. The
decision jolted a dance world accustomed to Graham's towering
presence even after death and to the legacy of works that helped
shape American modern dance. The shock was felt in ballet as well
as modern dance circles. The suspension pointed up the
vulnerability of a field where money is scarce and careers are
short.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which was founded in 1929 by Graham, has an
accumulated deficit of $500,000. The sale of its longtime
headquarters on East 63rd Street in 1998 enabled it to pay off a
deficit of $2.4 million but left it with no major assets. The
troupe was scheduled to move into quarters in a new building this
month, but the board was unable to raise the $750,000 needed to
convert the raw space into studios and offices.
</P>
<P>
   The company is to meet with Marvin Preston, executive director
of the troupe, on Tuesday to discuss the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The dancers were to have begun rehearsals on Tuesday for an
engagement that would open the American Dance Festival season in
Durham, N.C., on June 8. Other canceled performances include an
appearance in ``The Legacy of Martha Graham and Paul Taylor,'' a
two-week festival at the Kennedy Center in Washington in September.
A three-week season at the Joyce Theater in Chelsea in November has
not been canceled in the hope that the situation will improve.
</P>
<P>
   The news of the suspension was received with surprise and
sadness in other dance companies. ``It's a damned shame,'' Kevin
McKenzie, artistic director of American Ballet Theater, said
Friday. Peter Martins, artistic director of the New York City
Ballet, said he had been saddened by the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only made me realize how frail our world is,'' Martins
said. ``This would never have occurred in France or Germany or
Denmark. They would not let this happen. The arts flourish in this
country because of the people who pay for it. But it's not
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Topping, the director of the Martha Graham Ensemble, broke
the news to his dancers on Thursday. The group, which is made up of
advanced students at the Graham school, was to have performed at
Marymount Manhattan Theater on the Upper East Side in mid-June.
Topping walked in on a rehearsal of Graham's ``Night Chant,'' a
rarely seen 1988 piece set to American Indian flute music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to stop them,'' he said. ``We waited a few
minutes. It was so painful to watch them dance so beautifully. They
were just bewildered.'' The school, which had been operating in
rented space at 440 Lafayette Street, draws students from around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Some dancers choked back tears as they arrived for the last
class Friday. ``I feel very empty and numb,'' Claudia Spahr, a
21-year-old dancer from Switzerland, said. ``But I'm not angry. I
have great hope.'' Several teachers have volunteered to teach
without pay next week.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Lang, who started dancing with the Graham company in 1942,
called the news devastating. Lang, a major interpreter of Graham
roles, teaches at the school, the prime source of training in the
Graham technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a crucial, crucial moment,'' Lang said. ``It's the
first time since 1926 that there will not be a Graham school. It's
a question of saving the school, because out of the school later
there can be other activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Graham technique, Lang said, uniquely trains ``the inner,
visceral muscles'' to motivate movement from the center of the body
to its extremities, adding a dramatic third dimension to Graham
dance. ``It takes years of training for that center to illuminate
the rest of the body,'' she said. ``It cannot be learned just by
watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Some dancers were angered by the suddenness of the decision.
``There was not even two weeks' notice,'' Crockett said.
</P>
<P>
   It is late for dancers to find work for the summer. ``The hard
part is, yes, I can always teach, but the life of a dancer is so
precious in terms of time,'' said Elizabeth Auclair, another Graham
dancer said. ``There is no time to waste.''

 NEW SONTAG NOVEL CREATES A STIR BY NOT CREDITING QUOTES FROM OTHER
BOOKS  (ART ADV: Photo NYT4 has been sent to NYT photo clients.

<P>
   When Ellen Lee, an 81-year-old amateur historian, read Susan
Sontag's new novel about a grand 19th-century actress, she was
startled by words that seemed oddly familiar in language and tone.
</P>
<P>
   Two times more she read through ``In America,'' delicately
underlining passages that echoed to her from 30 years of lecturing
about Helena Modjeska, the Polish immigrant actress who had
inspired Sontag's historical novel and its main character, Maryna
Zalezowska.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she was done, Lee had highlighted at least 12
passages in Sontag's 387-page book that were similar to passages in
four other books about Modjeska. They were presented without credit
or attribution _ other than a line in the preface expressing a debt
to books and articles about Modjeska ``for material and anecdotes
used (and altered.)'' No writers were credited by name in the
novel.
</P>
<P>
   The authors were a varied lot, ranging from Willa Cather to
Helena Modjeska herself and a Polish Nobel laureate who is also a
model for a character in Sontag's novel. The familiar passages
ranged from an elaborate description of Modjeska's rose-colored
cashmere robe to Cather's evocative account of a toast delivered by
the actress ``looking into the blur of the candlelight.'' In
length, they ranged from a sentence or two to eight lines of
rhyming verse.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction was really bewilderment,'' recalled Lee, a
volunteer museum docent who helped found the Helena Modjeska
Foundation in Southern California. ``Why would a writer of Susan
Sontag's stature and prestige use sources without quotation marks
and without documentation? And then it occurred to me that maybe
the rules have changed and there are different rules for fiction
now.''
</P>
<P>
   That question is oddly debatable in a literary arena where
popular writers have already pushed the limits of artistic license
to treat history as a melange of fact and fiction. But in the case
of ``In America,'' the issue is highlighted because in some
passages the language itself is taken almost verbatim from other
authors.
</P>
<P>
   For Sontag, whose wide-ranging writing career has encompassed
fiction, essays, plays and films, standards have evolved for a form
of literature, the historical novel. She considers it ``a work of
art'' that belongs to a new genre that doesn't require the
footnotes of traditional histories.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us who deal with real characters in history transcribe
and adopt original sources in the original domain,'' said Sontag,
who noted that the passages in dispute amounted to fewer than three
pages in total. ``I've used these sources and I've completely
transformed them. I have these books. I've looked at these books.
There's a larger argument to be made that all of literature is a
series of references and allusions.''
</P>
<P>
   In her quest to capture a period with precision, Sontag offers
various explanations for using the language of others _ from
indulging in a whimsical inside literary joke, playing with
Cather's words, to drawing on the direct words of people she
considers primary sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``I distinguish between writers and sources,'' she said. ``Willa
Cather is a writer, but the others are sources. The sources
themselves are working from sources and they are using quotations
of actual words. I don't consider Modjeska's memoirs the work of a
writer. So what interests me is the transformation. She's the
source of my character and you can use a sentence that's exactly
the same because it is from her words. Of course, I've used her
words to create a completely different character.''
</P>
<P>
   Using the writings of Helena Modjeska and the 1905 Nobel
laureate, Henryk Sienkiewicz, a Polish journalist and author of
``Quo Vadis,'' Sontag wove their own words into scenes involving
her fictional immigrant actress, Maryna Zalezowska, and an
imaginary journalist, much like Sienkiewicz, who is called Ryszard
Kierulck.
</P>
<P>
   In some passages, it does appear that Sontag used descriptions,
Polish quotations translated into English and verses collected and
written by an obscure writer, Marion Moore Coleman who in 1969
self-published ``Fair Rosalind: The American Career of Helena
Modjeska.'' But Sontag said the similarities derived from her and
Coleman's use of some of the same original newspaper accounts and
letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fair Rosalind'' was a title that Lee knew well because she had
befriended Coleman while she was researching the more than
1,000-page book.
</P>
<P>
   Lee started underlining passages after she was approached by an
Orange County Register reporter who described some language
similarities, but focused on differences between the facts of
Modjeska's life in a home in the Santa Ana foothills in the 1870s
and the fictional tale of Sontag's actress, Maryna.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she was through, Lee had collected similar passages
from two other books of nonfiction, including Modjeska's 1910
memoirs, ``Memories and Impressions,'' and the translated letters
of Sienkiewicz, ``Portrait of America.''
</P>
<P>
   But the more detailed information and wording came from
Coleman's biography, which included extensive footnotes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ``In America'' contains a lavish description of
Maryna Zalezowska's dress that Coleman attributes to an 1878
Louisville Courier-Journal report: ``Cashmere robe of peach-blossom
pink, trimmed with a cascade of lace down the front and one narrow
flounce around the bottom, lace ruffles on the elbow sleeves, a
lace fraise at the neck and one shell-shaped lace pocket on the
left side ornamented with a pink rosette.''
</P>
<P>
   Sontag's description _ with a line eliminated and some minor
words changed _ closely parallels Coleman's. Sontag said: ``I have
that newspaper account where Marion Coleman got her information. I
have all this in my computer. It comes from a newspaper account, I
think from Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same biography, Coleman painstakenly chronicles the
verses delivered in tribute to Modjeska by various admirers and
critics. Some of them are virtually unchanged in Sontag's novel.
For example, Coleman's biography described a poem sent with a
bouquet to Modjeska by newspaper men.
</P>
<P>
   Hither, unheralded by voice of fame,
</P>
<P>
   Except as a fair foreigner you came:
</P>
<P>
   Light was the welcome that we had prepared
</P>
<P>
   Even our sympathies you scarcely shared:
</P>
<P>
   Not as the artist whom your people knew
</P>
<P>
   As some fresh novice did we look on you.
</P>
<P>
   In Sontag's novel, the same lines surface in an unsigned note
from an admirer to the fictional Maryna with slight changes of
wording and a character's interruption.
</P>
<P>
   For Sontag, the use of such lines reflects a zeal to capture a
historical period. In her previous novel ``The Volcano Lover,'' she
said, about 1 or 2 percent of the sentences or phrases came from
the written words of her real-life characters, like the letters
exchanged between Lady Emma Hamilton and Lord Nelson. ``There are
phrases and letters, part of a sentence in another sentence, all
reworked,'' she said. ``You get very haunted by this question of
fact, of making it absolutely right.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly striking to Lee was a passage that was clearly
borrowed from Cather's own description, in ``My Mortal Enemy,'' of
a toast delivered by Modjeska.
</P>
<P>
   Cather wrote: ``When Oswald asked her to propose a toast, she
put out her long arm, lifted her glass, and looking into the blur
of the candlelight with a grave face, said: `To my coun-n-try!'''
</P>
<P>
   The Sontag version is slightly different: ``When asked to
propose a toast, she put out her long arm, lifted her glass, and,
looking into the blur of the candlelight, crooned, `To my new
country!''' Another character mutters, `` `Country,' not
`coun-n-try.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sontag said that she had not read ``My Mortal Enemy,'' but that
a friend had sent her the description of the toast and she had
incorporated Cather's material as a ``literary joke.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``It was certainly a reference that I hoped people would pick
up,'' she said, adding that she had transformed the passage because
her character delivers a toast to the United States, rather than to
Poland, as in the Cather version.
</P>
<P>
   With other similar passages, Sontag said, she used the words of
``not writers, but sources in the public domain'' that inspired
similar characters in her novel. For example, she draws on passages
from the memoirs of Modjeska, who wrote about her memories of
chasing away boredom by killing flies after rummaging through toys
and discovering ``two tiny little bows.'' Modjeska continues: ``The
arrows were simply made of matches, with a needle at the end. We
aimed at the drowsy, sprawling sleeping flies which ornamented the
wooden walls of the room, and one by one our victims fell at our
feet. What do you think of that kind of occupation for Juliet or
Mary Stuart?''
</P>
<P>
   Sontag also used some similar sentences from ``Portrait of
America,'' the letters of Sienkiewicz, who wrote of ``ripe acorns
breaking loose from their pedicles and rustling through the leaves
as they fell to the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the many writers experimenting with historical fiction,
there is some disagreement about exactly what the standard is for
using the words of others. Some purists argue they will not change
any historical facts, although they insert imaginary characters
into the mix. Others are more flexible about facts, but not
language; Russell Banks, for instance, created an underground
railroad stop that didn't exist in his novel about the real
abolitionist John Brown, ``Cloud Splitter.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``When I have a book like `Cloud Splitter,''' Banks said, ``the
contract with the reader is that I'm telling a story. I'm not
writing a history, so I will tell you things that may not have
happened. But the assumption is that the language is mine, and if I
have taken language from elsewhere, I feel obliged to make that
evident.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   It is an accepted technique to develop characters by employing
what the author Thomas Mallon calls the ``scraps and traces of
history.'' But many writers draw the line at borrowing the language
of other writers although some are willing to quote real-life
figures who become characters in historical novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you're working in this genre, you're on a slippery
slope,'' said Mallon, the author of several historical novels and
also a book called ``Stolen Words: Forays Into the Origins and
Ravages of Plagiarism.'' ``A certain degree of pastiche is
acceptable and even necessary to the establishment of historical
figures as believable literary characters. But that doesn't absolve
the novelist from respecting the language that was crafted by other
contemporary scholars. Novelists should go to scholars for
information, not for language.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Chevalier, the author of the historical novel ``Girl With
a Pearl Earring,'' said that she had purposely chosen to write
about Vermeer and the anonymous model who posed for his famous
portrait because the 17th-century setting and scarcity of
information about the artist gave her great room to use her
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are taking an awful responsibility if you try to transform
the language of others,'' Chevalier said. ``For better or worse,
there aren't any standards that have been set out. I was trained as
an editor, so I'm somewhat anally retentive about getting
everything accurate. If I can verify a fact, I won't change it. But
other things are open to interpretation _ all that blurry stuff in
between. I think the interesting thing about the `Girl With the
Pearl Earring' is that we really don't know who she is. If I had
known, I probably wouldn't have written about her.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   For Lee, borrowing is unacceptable. But Sontag remains surprised
by such a reaction, given that her novel brought fresh attention to
a historical figure who had become obscure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually thought that they would be quite thrilled,'' Sontag
said. ``Modjeska was quite forgotten. She was a great figure. I
made her into a marvelous person. The real Modjeska was a horrible
racist.''

   CONCORD, N.C. _ Ward Burton is focused on his Winston Cup team,
which is second in the standings and three points out of first
place. But he wasn't too busy to notice a flock of Canadian geese
flying over Lowe's Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were about 13 of them trying to land in an open field,
but there were too many RVs out there,'' Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's love of nature is equal to his passion for motorsports.
He says he can be just as happy walking through the woods as he is
driving his No. 22 Pontiac in front of 200,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
   He started the Ward Burton Wildlife Foundation four years ago
and recently was picked to serve as honorary chairman of National
Hunting and Fishing Day, which is Sept. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said he started his foundation so future generations
could experience some of the same things he has in his life. The
foundation started with a core tract of 1,200 acres in Burton's
home county of Halifax, Va. It now covers more than 2,000 acres,
including 404 acres Burton bought this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started the foundation in 1996 to help preserve, protect
and manage some of our natural resources,'' Burton said. ``We want
to have some serene, natural places, mostly in real rural areas.
We're trying to leave it in its natural state for the next
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he hopes to eventually purchase land in other states,
including Tennessee and Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Before Burton discovered stock-car racing, he spent a two-year
stretch living off the land in a remote part of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I quit college after 2 1/2 years,'' Burton said. ``I couldn't
decide what to major in, and I didn't have a real good direction in
where my life was leading.''
</P>
<P>
   So he lived alone in a log cabin 45 miles from the nearest town,
trapping for a living and catching or shooting most of his meals.
</P>
<P>
   His only contacts with the outside world were occasional visits
from friends and a few trips to a couple of nearby farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably some of the most enjoyable times of my life,''
Burton said. ``I learned a lot and had a ball. I wasn't married,
and the only responsibility I had was to keep myself fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt a common bond with the out-of-doors. Life is
pretty simple out there in the forest. . . . It's a way to come in
touch with yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward's younger brother, Jeff, who is fourth in the Winston Cup
standings, also likes nature but not nearly as much as his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy the outdoors, but I don't share his passion for it,''
Jeff Burton said. ``And he is passionate about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Burton says that for as long as he can remember, his
brother has been an outdoors person _ hunting and fishing and
catching snakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't just kill animals. He helps give the animals a way
to take care of themselves,'' Jeff Burton said. ``We're all
beneficiaries of his efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Ward Burton also is a strong supporter of the
right to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   He said people who hunt and fish are the same people who spend
their money to conserve natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who weren't fortunate enough to have a dad or granddad
to take them fishing or hunting or canoeing don't understand that
the Second Amendment is one of the most important ones we have,''
Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   Ward Burton, now 38, eventually came out of the woods and joined
his brother as a stock-car racer. Although he was 26 before he
started driving, he joined the Winston Cup Series in 1994. Since
then he has won two races, placed in the top five 14 times and was
in the top 10 on 48 occasions. His career earnings are more than $7
million.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said he plans to remain involved in some way in Winston
Cup racing, even after his driving days have ended. But he also
plans new adventures outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life is going to go back to the simple way,'' he said.
``I'm going to spend a lot of time in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I want to learn to be a mountain man in the Rocky
Mountains. I'm going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The address of the Ward Burton Wildlife Foundation is P.O. Box
519, Halifax, VA 24558.

   If Thomas K. Lewis Jr. always wanted to be the sole chief
executive of a prominent, fast-growing company, Tuesday was his
lucky day. If, however, he did not want that company's stock price
to be at a 52-week low and falling as analysts retooled their
earnings forecasts into projected losses, then it was not so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, Lewis, 47, had shared the chief executive
title at Ameritrade Holding with the electronic brokerage firm's
founder and majority owner, J. Joe Ricketts, 58. In that time,
Ameritrade's stock price has plunged more than 80 percent from its
high of $57.75 to its low of $11 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   With technology stocks in a deep slump, the active traders
attracted by Ameritrade's $8 commissions have cut back on their
trading. The sharp decline in trading volume in the last several
weeks spells trouble for all brokerage firms, but none so much as
the slim-commission electronic trading firms like Ameritrade.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who officially succeeded Ricketts on Tuesday, described
electronic brokerage firms that had branched out into banking and
other services as ``broad and shallow.'' By contrast, he said,
Ameritrade will ``stay intensely focused on the self-directed
investor.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a long market downturn, that narrow focus could prove
painful, analysts say. ``It's the companies that are the most
transaction-dependent that get hurt the most,'' said Amy Butte, an
analyst for Bear, Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike bigger rivals like TD Waterhouse and ETrade Group,
Ameritrade has remained focused on providing cheap, fast trades
over the Internet. It has signed up more than a million customers,
many of them lured in by its big-budget ad campaign featuring a
computer-savvy character named Stuart.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Wrona, manager of the PBHG Technology and Communications
fund, sold all of the Ameritrade shares in his fund earlier this
year. ``I didn't see the competitive landscape changing for the
better for any of these e-brokers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wrona started buying shares of Ameritrade in the fourth quarter
of 1999 because, he said, he was certain that the rising volume of
stock trading late last year would result in strong earnings for
electronic brokerage firms. He was right: Ameritrade and ETrade
posted slight profits last quarter. But he also thought that would
reverse the long slide in their stock prices that started a year
ago. On that score, he said, ``I was dead wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors feared the online brokers were engaged in a nonstop
marketing battle that would eat up most or all of their profits.
Ameritrade is spending $200 million on advertising and promotion
this fiscal year and plans to spend $250 million next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to see profits _ and now,'' said Richard Strauss,
a Goldman, Sachs analyst. ``And even if they see profits _ and now
_ they're not necessarily going to be convinced in this market
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Strauss, a longtime bull on Charles Schwab's stock, recently
told clients that TD Waterhouse, the discount brokerage arm of
Toronto Dominion Bank, was worth considering as an alternative. He
has not recommended buying Ameritrade or ETrade, even at their
depressed levels.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who have been recommending those stocks spent last week
revising estimates of how much they will earn, based on
expectations that the number of trades executed through those firms
during the current quarter will be at least 20 percent lower than
last quarter. Earnings should drop in step with revenue because the
firms are not cutting back on their marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Ameritrade reported net income of 2 cents a share last quarter.
Matthew Vetto, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, now expects it to
lose 3 cents a share this quarter, instead of earning 2 cents, and
expects it to add 205,000 accounts in the quarter, down from his
previous estimate of 240,000. He expects ETrade to break even this
quarter and to add about 300,000 accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Vetto rates Ameritrade a better buy than ETrade and
ETrade a better buy than DLJdirect, the online brokerage arm of
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. DLJdirect is less attractive, he
says, because it is smaller and not as well known as the others.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of scale will pose a growing problem for these firms as
traditional brokerage firms, including Merrill Lynch, and banks
start promoting their new online services, analysts say. Butte
points to the recent sale by National Discount Brokers of a stake
to Deutsche Bank of Germany as recognition of that looming threat.
</P>
<P>
   TD Waterhouse and DLJdirect have parents with deep pockets, and
most analysts believe that Schwab, with a market capitalization of
$31 billion, is big enough to remain independent. But some think
the smaller firms, including E-Trade and Ameritrade, will have to
merge to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Ameritrade's stock jumped in late March on speculation that
Ricketts might sell the company. But those takeover hopes
dissipated as trading activity cooled well before the market's
usual summer slowdown. Not even the announcement this week that
Ricketts plans to start unloading his huge stake by selling 20
million shares could rekindle investor interest.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis waves off talk of a buyout, saying, ``We don't have any
serious discussions about that.'' Besides, he says, to appease
Ameritrade's shareholders, a buyer ``would have to pay such a
premium.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, says Steve Galbraith, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein,
it may be about time for opportunistic buyers to take notice of
electronic brokerages. ``The sentiment on these things shifts so
extremely that if they get sold down too much more, they could
represent decent value.''

JUSTICE PURSUING PINOCHET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even if General Augusto Pinochet is never actually tried and
convicted for crimes against humanity that were committed in Chile
during his military dictatorship, the vote Tuesday by Chile's Court
of Appeals to strip him of the legal immunity he enjoyed as a
senator-for-life confirmed principles crucial to a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the court's ruling affirmed the centrality of justice
that is impervious to politics and rendered by an independent
judiciary. Chile's moderate socialist president, Ricardo Lagos, has
laudably refrained from any effort to intervene in the politically
charged case as it proceeds through the Chilean court system.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the Chilean military took the opposite tack, making
gestures and statements meant to intimidate Lagos, the courts, and
the plaintiff families of Chileans who disappeared after Pinochet's
military putsch in 1973. Immediately after the Appeals Court
decision, the chief of Chile's army, General Ricardo Izurieta, paid
an ostentatious visit to Pinochet and called the visit a show of
``institutional support'' by the military for its old chief.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's son, also called Augusto, went so far as to intimate
that another coup could be provoked if the 108 lawsuits against his
father were not abandoned. He said the prosecution of the erstwhile
dictator ``is planting the seed of a deep division among Chileans,
and when this happens the result may be a situation like the one in
September 1973.'' All Chileans would recognize this allusion to
Pinochet's original seizure of power.
</P>
<P>
   In response, President Lagos firmly defended democratic
institutions and procedures, until Izurieta said that Chile's armed
forces regret, but will accept, the court's lifting of Pinochet's
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Since Pinochet and his backers fought a Spanish effort to
extradite him from Britain on the grounds that only Chilean courts
could try him for crimes committed under his regime, Chilean judges
and elected leaders have become the ultimate defenders not only of
Chileans' human rights, but of a democratic justice that cannot be
thwarted or corrupted by power.

BANKRUPT VALUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In attempting to tighten bankruptcy rules that have sometimes
been unfairly exploited by sharp operators, Congress risks adopting
a system that is unduly harsh on innocent victims of hard times.
The bill nearing passage in the Senate deserves a veto by President
Clinton if it retains these features in its final version.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1 million individuals and households a year seek
bankruptcy protection. Most have relatively low incomes as the
consequence of illness, unexpected job loss, or other income,
divorce, or domestic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there are some who turn to bankruptcy with the
express intent of bilking their creditors. Among the loopholes they
use, one of the more prominent is by investing heavily in expensive
homes that are shielded in some states _ notably Texas and Florida
_ allowing them to keep significant assets while repudiating
legitimate obligations. Attempts at closing or reducing this debtor
loophole have been resisted by Republican leadership in both House
and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Congress has used the rising number of bankruptcies
coupled with isolated abuses of the system to seek far heavier
retrictions on ordinary victims of economic disaster. They have
raised the standards under which debtors, once bankrupt, are
forgiven all obligations in order to speed their ultimate ability
to get back on their feet, over the objections of critics like
Senator Edward M. Kennedy. Under the new rules, debtors would be
required to live under unreasonably tight spending regimes while
attempting to repay creditors at improbably fast paces. Apart from
its bad impact at a human level, the system would likely produce
additional financial failures.
</P>
<P>
   Some people borrow unwisely or even with fraudulent intent. Some
institutions lend unwisely, are evasive about the terms of their
lending, and want more weapons for squeezing debtors when they run
into difficulty. Congress must do a better job of finding the
middle path between these conflicting situations than it has so
far. To do less penalizes victims of bad luck, to everyone's
long-term disadvantage.

CORZINE IS SOURCE OF MONEY FLOWING TO NEW JERSEY DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The checks began cascading in a month before the elections in
New Jersey last November _ $20,000 to the campaign arm of the
Democrats in the state Senate, $15,000 to the Democratic machine in
Hudson County, $15,000 to the one in Union County. Out of nowhere,
it seemed, affluent guardian angels were coming to the party's aid.
</P>
<P>
   The organizer of the donations, and one of the chief givers, was
Jon Corzine, the Democratic contender for the U.S. Senate, a rookie
candidate who has sought to create something of an insta-bloc of
support at the grass roots by raining his and his friends' money on
local party treasuries in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The Corzine campaign said on Thursday that, as of May 17, it had
spent $24.9 million, nearly all of it Corzine's money, to compete
in the June 6 primary against former Gov. Jim Florio, easily a
record for a Senate primary.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the campaign has spent another $5.8 million,
according to documents filed with the Federal Election Commission.
The new money puts his spending ahead of the previous record for an
entire Senate election _ the nearly $30 million spent by Michael
Huffington in his unsuccessful California race in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The spending, largely on political advertisements, has vaulted
the once-unknown Corzine, a former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &AMP;
Co., past Florio in recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   But Corzine has not just used part of his $400 million fortune
on 30-second television ads. With endorsements by local party
committees a pivotal factor in New Jersey primaries, he has also
funneled campaign cash directly to Democratic politicians and
political organizations.
</P>
<P>
   This month, in fact, the Corzine campaign donated $20,000 to
$30,000 each to 10 party organizations across New Jersey, from
Bergen County in the north to Ocean County at the shore.
</P>
<P>
   And when Corzine's donations to the committees neared or reached
legal limits, he recruited friends to make contributions _ friends
like Steven Roth, whose company is one of the largest commercial
property owners in Manhattan, and George Wellde Jr., who worked
with Corzine at Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   This fund raising offers a primer on how a newcomer can
penetrate an often insular political culture and be embraced as a
candidate _ a strategy also followed by Eliot Spitzer, another
wealthy Democrat, who was elected New York attorney general in 1998
without experience in elected office.
</P>
<P>
   The donations in New Jersey, which helped the Democrats pick up
seats in the state Assembly last November and win some important
local elections, graphically highlight the question now dominating
the Senate primary: has Corzine's money turned the race from a
political contest to a financial one?
</P>
<P>
   Florio bluntly declares that Corzine is trying to buy the
loyalty of party leaders and voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it's been successful to the degree that he has
gotten support from those who have been purchased,'' Florio said in
an interview. ``But I'm not sure that it is going to be successful
in the election, because I think that people have gotten to be
offended by this unrelenting auction that we are in.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine did not respond to several requests to be interviewed
for this article.
</P>
<P>
   His advisers say that the spending at the local level is
intended to revitalize a party that has been financially troubled
since it lost power in Trenton in the early 1990s. They point out
that Corzine has long been a generous contributor to the Democratic
Party on the national level, and is now merely redirecting his
donations to the state and local party.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jim Florio raises money from people who received jobs and
contracts from Governor Florio, he calls that principled support,''
said Orin S. Kramer, a financier who is a senior adviser and
fund-raiser for Corzine.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jon receives endorsements from Democratic organizations
which regard another Florio candidacy as the sequel to `Nightmare
on Elm Street,' the governor calls it bribery,'' Kramer said. ``If
Governor Florio hadn't virtually eviscerated the Democratic Party a
decade ago, we wouldn't have to work so hard at rebuilding it
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Local support is important in New Jersey because the candidate
endorsed by a county committee receives a better primary ballot
position in that county. Though Florio has been in politics for
much of his life, Corzine has received the endorsement of counties
that have about two-thirds of the state's registered Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine has employed local chieftains _ an Essex County
freeholder is on his campaign payroll, as is the party chairman in
Ocean County _ and he regularly opens his checkbook for their
campaigns and pet causes. One day, his campaign was spending $1,070
on catering for the Black United Fund; on another, it was $1,000
for tickets to a dinner for the Hispanic American Association for
Political Awareness.
</P>
<P>
   And Corzine has added to this windfall for the party by
corralling donations from friends, many of whom are newcomers to
New Jersey politics.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, party committees can accept a maximum of
$30,000 annually per donor, while most candidates can receive up to
$1,800 from each individual per election cycle. Once Corzine hits
the limit, it is perfectly legal for him to ask his friends to
contribute.
</P>
<P>
   In October, for example, Roth of Vornado Realty Trust donated
$10,000 to the Democratic State Committee, $30,000 to the campaign
arm of the Democrats in the state Senate and $10,000 to the Mercer
County Democrats _ all at Corzine's request. Roth, who in recent
years has mostly given to Republicans in New Jersey, declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Or take the campaign committee of Mayor Sharpe James of Newark,
who is also a state senator and one of the state's most influential
black Democrats. Corzine and his wife, Joanne, each donated $1,800
to James' committee, the maximum. So did Kramer and his sister,
Sari. And an array of other executives and their spouses, including
Wellde, the Goldman Sachs executive, made donations.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Wellde later gave $10,000 to the Assembly Democrats. Another
former colleague of Corzine's at Goldman Sachs, Eric Mindich,
donated $20,000 to the state party. Both men did not respond to
phone calls at their offices seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Another big Wall Street donor was Adam Solomon, chairman of
Shaker Investments, who at Corzine's and Kramer's urging,
contributed $15,000 to the Union County party and $15,000 to the
Hudson County party.
</P>
<P>
   ``As someone committed to the Democratic agenda,'' Solomon said,
``I believe that it is very important that Jon Corzine be the party
nominee because he is our strongest candidate in November.
Supporting Jon is also an effective way of helping Democrats at
both the local and national levels.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Florio campaign has complained that many local
politicians have endorsed Corzine solely to get access to his
wallet, the politicians have usually responded that Florio is not
electable because of the tax increase he pushed through as
governor. And they maintain that candidates for major offices are
always channeling money to local committees.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats in the state Assembly received an array of
donations from Corzine and his supporters last fall _ several large
ones to their political committee, and smaller ones to the
candidates' campaigns. Their leader is Assemblyman Joseph Doria of
Hudson County, one of the most influential supporters of Corzine's
candidacy in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing different than what Jim Florio did when he was
governor,'' Doria said of the donations. ``Florio was helping us
with campaigns, providing money to the local parties. This is part
of the political process and part of political leadership. There is
nothing wrong with it.''
</P>
<P>
   When told of Doria's comments, Florio scoffed and said nothing
in the state's political history approached Corzine's spending.
``This is truly an effort to purchase not just the nomination, not
just the job, but the party itself,'' Florio said.

RETHINKING WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 28, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans this weekend turn their attention to soldiers who in
past wars have sacrificed their lives for their country. It would
be fitting for them also to recast their thinking to take into
account a huge change in the nature of conflict around the world
during the 20th century. A brutal fact of modern war is that
civilians have become the target of much military action, dying by
the millions.
</P>
<P>
   America itself has been spared this horror for the most part.
The country has sent its military forces abroad in support of
allies and to protect national interests in other regions. There
have been no attacks on American soil since Pearl Harbor in 1941
and a brief Japanese intrusion in Alaska's Aleutian Islands.
American civilians have gone virtually untouched by any form of
violence, even to a large degree during the country's most horrific
conflict, the Civil War, during which 600,000 troops died.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the rest of the world it is a very different matter.
</P>
<P>
   World War I was spectacular for the squandering of lives in
bitter, largely stalemated trench warfare. Waves of soldiers were
ordered to attack heavily defended, deeply embedded lines only to
be slaughtered by the thousands. In the end, an estimated 8.5
million soldiers lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
   But civilians paid an even higher price. Although statistics are
less precise than those kept by the military, it has been estimated
that about 13 million civilians lost their lives from direct
military action or its side effects of hunger, exposure, and
disease. Notable among these are the 600,000 Armenians killed by
Turks in what has come to be regarded as the first major genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Systematic extinction of civilians played a major part in Soviet
dictator Joseph Stalin's treatment of opponents in the 1930s, when
as many as 20 million people perished through execution,
starvation, or gross neglect.
</P>
<P>
   In Spain, a civil war caught thousands not directly engaged in
the fighting itself, and loyalties made targets of ordinary people
who would otherwise have been bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   World War II raised the ante, particularly with German
extermination programs targeting Jews, with more than 5 million
Polish Jews alone the victims of death camps. More than 7 million
Soviet civilians perished in the war. The Germans themselves lost
almost as many civilians as soldiers _ 3.4 million and 3.5 million
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Allies did not attack civilians per se, massive air
raids on German cities like Dresden, Hamburg, and Bremen inevitably
inflicted widespread casualties in residential areas. In the war
against Japan, air raids culminating in the nuclear attacks on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki killed more than 650,000 Japanese civilians,
compared with military deaths of about 1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Worse was to come.
</P>
<P>
   In China, the fanaticism of Mao Zedong produced the vast turmoil
of his Great Leap Forward, in which perhaps 20 million died from
starvation and disease as Mao insisted on trying to restructure the
economy by bayonet-backed fiat.
</P>
<P>
   America's most agonizing war, in Vietnam, was destructive enough
in its own right, with 58,000 Americans dead, but the conflict led
to terrifying slaughter in neighboring Cambodia, when Khmer Rouge
forces killed an estimated 1 million in a country with about 10
million total population.
</P>
<P>
   Now Africa has become the seat of organized brutality against
civilians, who have become the target of choice for revolutionary
and military movements alike. In Algeria, orthodox Islamic
terrorists have staged repeated midnight raids on village
communities, slitting the throats of sleeping women, children, and
the elderly in attempts to discredit the regime in Algiers. Civil
wars in Sudan, Angola, and Sierra Leone have weighed heavily on
noncombatants. Perhaps worst of all was the slaughter of 800,000
Tutsis in Rwanda as the world watched in horror _ and did nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Abuse of civilians has been morally contemptible from the
beginning of history and technically illegal as the result of
international accords like the Geneva Conventions. But the depth of
the problem is illustrated by current trials at The Hague of those
accused in dreadful crimes during ethnic strife in the wake of
Yugoslavia's disintegration. At best, a few individuals have been
brought to justice when tens of thousands perished.
</P>
<P>
   War is a grim and terrible business. Its military victims go
into battle knowing their lives are at stake. But civilians have
become participants exactly because they are nominally outside the
boundaries of direct conflict. Killing civilians, when it is not
just a move to exterminate competitors for land or other resources,
is an attempt to inflict wounds that will discourage opponents from
further resistance. It is an ugly, crude, and brutal technique _
and increasingly part of modern weaponry. This Memorial Day
weekend, victims belong in everyone's memory.

INQUIRY ON FBI CHIEF IN 1997 IS DISCLOSED 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1997 the Justice Department briefly looked into
whether Attorney General Janet Reno should seek an independent
counsel to investigate allegations that Louis Freeh, the director
of the FBI, lied to Congress, according to government and
congressional officials on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary inquiry concluded that Freeh did not
intentionally mislead Congress when he gave an incorrect
explanation of why the head of the bureau's crime laboratory had
been suspended. Instead, investigators concluded that Freeh had
been misinformed, and they noted that he quickly corrected his
error in a letter to Congress when it was pointed out to him. As a
result, they concluded, there was no need for any criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Although the event occurred over three years ago, the reasons
and the way in which it surfaced this week involve the continuing
battle between the Clinton Justice Department and congressional
Republicans over Reno's handling of allegations of fund-raising
irregularities by Democrats in the 1996 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary inquiry involving Freeh was contained in
documents sent by the Justice Department this week to the Senate
and House Judiciary Committees, which are looking into Reno's
decisions not to seek an independent counsel to investigate
Democratic fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   The decision not to seek an independent counsel for Freeh came
just weeks before Reno apparently first declined to seek an
independent counsel to investigate Democratic fund-raising
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican on the Judiciary
Committee and an ardent critic of Reno, said the Justice Department
included the information about Freeh for highly suspect reasons.
``This information wasn't even in the scope of our subpoena for
information,'' Specter said in an interview. ``It was gratuitously
volunteered and they did it to beat up Freeh a little bit and to
help them defend their decision not to go after Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats declined to comment publicly on the
documents. Specter said the situations of Freeh and of Vice
President Al Gore were ``as different as night and day.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Freeh was clearly shown to have made an innocent mistake
and corrected it quickly. The questions about Gore, he said,
involved whether he was telling the truth when he asserted he was
unaware that his fund-raising efforts were aimed at raising
so-called hard money _ money that is both limited and regulated by
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokeswoman said that the material
disclosing the preliminary inquiry about Freeh was part of a larger
document that was a direct response to the Judiciary Committee's
request for information about the campaign fund-raising
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate Judiciary Committee, at the request of Senator
Specter requested this body of material,'' said Carole Florman of
the Justice Department. ``It was therefore produced to the
committee under the accommodation that balances the department's
long-standing interest in maintaining confidentiality of our
deliberative material and the need for congressional oversight.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Over the years, Reno, who had once been a supporter of the
independent-counsel law, was believed to have become disenchanted
with it. Although she began to seek independent prosecutors less
often at the time she declined to do so for Freeh, she made her
most controversial decision nearly a year later when she authorized
Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater prosecutor, to look into allegations
involving President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Friday, Reno said that under the
independent-counsel law that expired last June, the department had
no choice but to launch an inquiry into Freeh's congressional
testimony. She said that ``Director Freeh made an unintentional
mistake'' and that she had the utmost respect for his integrity.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the preliminary inquiry into whether he
intentionally misled Congress, Freeh was an outspoken advocate
within government circles for the appointment of an independent
counsel to investigate the Democrats, especially Gore.

DE BEERS BEGINS SEIZING ANGOLAN GOVERNMENT DIAMONDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ De Beers, the world's leading diamond company, has
begun seizing shipments of Angolan government diamonds following
the breakdown of a 10-year-old agreement with Angola to market
stones from a major concession, company officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The seizures coincide with an upheaval in Africa's
diamond-trading networks because of international pressure to end
the trade in so-called conflict diamonds, sold by African military
forces to finance wars.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, De Beers said it would begin certifying its
diamonds as untainted by conflict following the closure of buying
offices in Africa. It also said it would concentrate on sales of
its own proprietary stones from South Africa, Botswana and Namibia.
At the time, though, De Beers said it would continue to market
certified diamonds from areas under government control in Angola
that have traditionally been shipped to Antwerp, Belgium, for
cutting and polishing.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of shifts since then, though, Angolan authorities
have canceled De Beers' marketing agreement as they re-organized
the government diamond business, according to De Beers officials
and diamond industry executives in Antwerp.
</P>
<P>
   And, as De Beers influence has waned, the Angolan government has
begun diverting its rough diamond shipments to Israel from Antwerp.
``This is a catastrophe for us,'' said an Antwerp diamond industry
official, who spoke in return for anonymity. He estimated annual
loss to the Antwerp trade at $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is one of the world's major cutting centers for rough
diamonds. But, in a United Nations report earlier this year on the
enforcement of sanctions against African rebel groups trading in
illicit gems, Israel escaped censure while Antwerp was singled out
for criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation of De Beers' Angolan contract left the diamond
giant with a $50 million outstanding loan owed by the Angolan
authorities dating to 1990. In an effort to recover the loan, the
company got a Belgian court order in March to seize two packages of
Angolan diamonds to establish whether they originated in areas
covered by the canceled agreement, company officials said. De Beers
experts examined the diamonds on April 3, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that the diamonds had not originated from the
concession covered by the canceled contract. A De Beers spokesman
said, however, that the company would seek similar action to seize
packages of Angolan diamonds arriving in Israel if it suspected
they originated from the concession, which is under Angolan
government control.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether the shift in Angolan trading patterns
was a result of the seizures.
</P>
<P>
   The shift away from De Beers in Angola reflects what some
industry experts see as a trend for smaller challengers with ties
to African governments to move in to areas once dominated by De
Beers. In Angola, diamond industry experts said, a newly formed
state diamond marketing company, Ascorp, had ties to smaller rivals
of De Beers.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, moreover, a new African diamond concern, Oryx
Diamonds Ltd., with ties to the governments of Congo and Zimbabwe,
will sell shares on the London Stock Exchange.

MAYER OFFMAN'S DEVOTION TO INVESTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 28)  
 By HILARY ROSENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last March, after attending synagogue morning and evening for
nearly a year, Mayer Offman decided to take a break from his
devotions.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a wise investment move, according to Offman, chief
investment strategist at Carlin Equities Group, a New York firm
that caters to day traders. Soon, Offman, who is an ordained rabbi,
began losing money on his trades. While others might have put the
blame on Nasdaq's sell-off, Offman believes other factors were also
at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Judaism, everything you do, there's reward or punishment,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once he resumed his synagogue worship, after a few weeks, his
returns improved. Year to date through May 19, his portfolio is up
more than 125 percent versus a loss of 3.8 percent for the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Offman, 49, pursued rabbinical studies at Yeshiva University in
the mid-1970s. But he could not resist business school at night.
Eventually, the lure of finance won out: After a stint as a Hebrew
school teacher, he became, first, an auditor at Ernst &AMP; Young and
then a broker and trader. In 1993, he co-founded Carlin with Ronald
H. Shear, now its chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   A large man with flyaway graying hair and a yarmulke, Offman has
a rapid-fire style of speaking that reflects his trading style. As
it turns out, he seems to be good at what he does. Over the last
three years through May 19, he said, his portfolio has risen 2,300
percent to $43.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Although he does not practice as a rabbi, Offman serves as
Carlin's in-house mentor, training less experienced traders and
conducting morning conference calls in which he recommends long and
short positions to the firm's 1,000 or so day-trading customers
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether day trading is a noble profession, Offman has
strong views; it brings much-needed liquidity to the markets, he
said. Unlike day-trading houses that cater to ordinary investors,
Carlin generally welcomes only experienced brokers or traders, most
of whom are seasoned Wall Street professionals.
</P>
<P>
   About three-quarters of Offman's own portfolio is used to take
positions that are held for no longer than a day. Another 15
percent is reserved for investments of two to three months. The
rest is invested in what Offman calls ``quirks,'' such as merger
candidates in which he takes an arbitrage position.
</P>
<P>
   For his short-term investments, Offman said he usually follows
the trend, buying stocks that are hot and betting against the
stocks that are weakening by selling them short. He holds stocks as
long as they outperform: when they stop doing so, he sells. The
reverse is true when he shorts a stock.
</P>
<P>
   But such trading is not as off-the-cuff as it first appears.
Offman incorporates fundamental research in his decisions about
whether to buy or short. During the day, Offman devours analysts'
reports and scans news services. His aim is to understand as much
as he can about active stocks so that he can take a stand on
whether a stock or group of stocks is starting on an upward or
downward trend.
</P>
<P>
   Offman begins his day at around 8:30 a.m., watching premarket
trading in S&AMP;P 500 futures and stock trading on Instinet, the
electronic market. He pays special attention to the previous day's
five or so strongest and weakest stocks. When the market opens,
Offman often trades those stocks, expecting the trend to continue.
</P>
<P>
   He also watches stocks that open at prices significantly higher
than the previous day's close. ``If in the first half-hour, the
stock is down only a small amount from the opening, it will
probably make another run on the upside,'' he said. So he buys in.
For shorting opportunities, Offman does the reverse, looking for
stocks that open significantly lower than the previous close.
</P>
<P>
   Offman may make 500 trades a day in a particularly active rising
market. In the month of May, through Friday, he has traded about
350 different stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, in the last half hour of trading, Offman sells out
some positions and makes sure that the remainder are completely
hedged, balanced out by shorts on stocks in industries that he
views negatively.
</P>
<P>
   One of Offman's favorite longer-term stocks is NeoRx, a Seattle
biotechnology company that, among other things, is testing a
radioactive compound for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Offman
started buying at $5 a share in early February. He sold those
shares in the first week in March at prices ranging from $25 to
$40. The stock dipped in early April, and he began purchasing
shares again for an average price of about $15. Shares closed
Friday at $13.125.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite short position recently has been Amazon.com. ``I
began shorting it the day Time magazine made Jeff Bezos the Man of
the Year,'' Offman said, referring to Amazon's chief executive. At
the time, the stock was trading at more than $95 a share. It closed
Friday at $46.50. ``I think they're a long way from making money,''
said Offman, adding that he believes the stock will sink to $25 or
$30.

GORE'S NEW STRATEGY TO BLEND PERSONAL LIFE WITH POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also GORE-BRADLEY) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORDOVA, Tenn. _ After spending several weeks watching his
opponent grab headlines and project a more moderate image, Vice
President Al Gore is embarking on a new campaign strategy that will
blend personal, biographical details with policy matters in his
ongoing effort to reach voters on a human level.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Gore is to give the commencement address to the 944
cadets graduating from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.
Aides said he would discuss both his plans for military
preparedness and his experience as an Army enlistee in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   He is expected to elaborate on his Army experience on Monday,
Memorial Day, in a speech in western Pennsylvania. On Wednesday, he
plans to hold a conference on mental health with his wife, Tipper,
who has battled depression.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday he is to give a major speech on cancer research at a
time when scientists are completing work on the human genome
project, a long-running interest of Gore's. And on Friday he will
speak about the responsibility of fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of running for the presidency is introducing yourself to
the American people,'' said Chris Lehane, the vice president's
press secretary. ``People want to know about the experiences that
influenced his thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been introducing and reintroducing himself for some
months now, but some of his advisers worry that there is still a
gap in voters' knowledge about him and that this is hurting him in
comparisons with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, his Republican
rival.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Gore campaign and the Democratic National
Committee are preparing television commercials, largely
biographical, for which Gore has been taping scenes over the last
few weeks. They will highlight his experiences outside of
Washington, including his time in Tennessee as a divinity student
and a journalist, and his family, including the fact that he has
been married 30 years and is a new grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice presidents are famous but not well known,'' Lehane said.
``Most people's notion of him is standing behind a podium.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Kamark, Gore's domestic policy adviser, noted that ever
since 1992 he has held annual conferences on topics related to the
family, medical care for children and stresses on the modern
family. She said these policy discussions bring out the best in the
vice president and give the greatest insight into both his
character and his views about what is important.
</P>
<P>
   Kamark said these family issues ``combine both policy and his
personal experiences as a parent, and you get a sense of how he
would use the bully pulpit'' as president.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Gore spent the day at the Cordova School, a
1,120-student magnet school here outside Memphis, his sixth such
visit to schools around the country since the end of the primary
season in March. His main message, as it was during previous school
visits, was to emphasize the involvement of parents in their
children's lives. The level of detail in which he becomes engrossed
was evident in his response to a question about the behavior of
children on school buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the school bus drivers in a school in North Carolina
made a suggestion that might go to your question,'' Gore said. ``He
said that when children bring home their report cards on how
they're doing in their course work that they ought to get a grade
in bus.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's West Point appearance this weekend has prompted criticism
from another veteran who wonders where the line is between allowing
a vice president to address the academy if he is also a political
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole, a World War II veteran who was the Republican
presidential nominee in 1996, was invited informally five years ago
to deliver a speech at the academy, Doug MacKinnon, Dole's
spokesman, said in an interview. But MacKinnon said the invitation
was withdrawn ``at the last minute'' because it was deemed
political. The academy, which allowed members of Congress to speak
on the campus in the 1800s, now allows only the president, the vice
president and the speaker of the House to address the cadets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no ill will toward anyone,'' MacKinnon said. ``We just
want to try to get clarification on the policy, what the rules are,
who created the exceptions, why the Senate majority leader isn't on
the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. James Whaley, a spokesman for West Point, said in an
interview that ``speaking at graduation is normally reserved for
the president, vice president or speaker of the House, and Dole was
a senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how those who attend the graduation ceremony might
distinguish Gore the vice president from Gore the presidential
candidate, Whaley said the vice president's right to speak ``to
future leaders of our nation and our Army'' cannot be taken away
from him because he is aspiring to higher office.

 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Lebanon has indicated that it will abide by
the United Nations' certification of Israel's withdrawal from
southern Lebanon, the U.N. special envoy to the Middle East, Terje
Roed Larsen, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If Larsen's assessment proves true, it could smooth a
significant bump in the road ahead. A rejection by Lebanon of the
United Nations' certification would give the green light to
guerrillas of the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah, or Party of God, to
continue their violent struggle against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   With official Lebanese acceptance, however, Hezbollah, despite
its fiery statements, would probably incline toward restraint.
Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, the group's leader, has said many times
that he would not defy the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, in another sign of the way Nasrallah and the Lebanese
establishment are embracing each other this week, the sheik
appeared for the first time in front of a Lebanese, rather than a
Hezbollah, flag at a large victory rally.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern town of Bint Jbail, a couple of miles from the
Israeli border, he also went out of his way to pronounce the
Israeli withdrawal earlier this week from its former security zone
as a victory for all of Lebanon and not just for his fighters.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Nasrallah spoke freely and casually with
foreign journalists, analyzing events for the first time since the
Israeli withdrawal. He said the fact that the Israelis were able to
withdraw without any casualties was not for Hezbollah's lack of
trying. His fighters fired on Israeli troops but they did so under
heavy aircraft cover and at night, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sheik also said that Hezbollah's march through southern
Lebanon on Tuesday, when they retook village after village and
forced an overnight Israeli withdrawal from the zone, was so
spontaneous that neither Syria nor Iran knew about it in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They found out like everybody else did,'' Nasrallah said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese president and prime minister have not made their
position on the U.N. certification process public, even as U.N.
teams fanned out across southern Lebanon on Friday to verify
whether Israel's withdrawal was complete.
</P>
<P>
   While lower-level Lebanese officials and their Syrian
counterparts insisted that the U.N. determination would be
discounted, they avoided the subject and spoke positively of
collaborating with the United Nations in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese government's position has been murky since the U.N.
Security Council rejected Beirut's claim that the withdrawal would
be complete only if Israel also pulled out of a pocket of disputed
land beside the Golan Heights _ a remote, rugged area known as the
Shebaa Farms.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, rejecting the Security Council's position would
prove costly for Lebanon, which not only needs the United Nations'
assistance but seeks international backing to rebuild the
war-ravaged southern zone. On the other hand, Lebanon faces
pressure from Hezbollah and Syria to hold fast to its principles.
</P>
<P>
   Giving Lebanon a way to accept the United Nations' authority
without compromising its position, the United Nations underlined
that it was not determining sovereignty over the Shebaa Farms area,
which was under Syrian control when Israel occupied it. Lebanon and
Syria could draft new maps clearly defining their border, Larsen
said, and petition the U.N. Security Council to change its
resolutions governing the territories accordingly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Any nongovernmental organization that hopes to be treated as
legitimate has to adapt to the decisions of the Security Council,
too,'' Larsen said, referring to Hezbollah and other resistance
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah has an interest in keeping the conflict alive, apart
from its ideological one. If the withdrawal is accepted, the
Lebanese army will eventually move into the southern zone and then
seek to disarm the guerrillas. But Hezbollah and the Syrian
government, which assists it, are not ready to lay down their
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   So it suits their purposes to insist that the occupation of
southern Lebanon still exists even if Hezbollah quietly agrees not
to take the initiative in any violence toward Israel. How this
contradiction resolves itself will be seen after the United Nations
certifies the Israeli withdrawal, which is expected to happen soon.
</P>
<P>
   Nasrallah said this week that Hezbollah would not attack
civilians across the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then again,'' he said, ``not all Israelis are civilians, so
anything is possible.''

TECHNOLOGY AND TIMING CAN OUTFOX THE BEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., May 28) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the years, investors in technology stocks have become
accustomed to coping with mini-bear markets in the sector once or
maybe twice a year. But the bear they are looking at right now is
no koala.
</P>
<P>
   Through Friday, the Nasdaq composite index had declined 21.2
percent this year, and more than 36 percent from its peak on March
10. Even so, some Internet stocks still trade at triple-digit
multiples. And even with the fall, the Nasdaq index is still nearly
30 percent higher than it was at the start of the 1999 Memorial Day
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   With the Federal Reserve raising rates, there is every chance
that the selling will continue. But the fundamentals remain
excellent, and earnings are strong. Which makes you wonder if the
worst isn't over.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Berry, co-portfolio manager of the RS Information Age Fund,
took some time last week to talk about technology and timing. Here
are excerpts from the conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Q. In the last three months of last year and the first three
months of 2000, a lot of folks were screaming about insane
technology valuations. Did you hear those screams?
</P>
<P>
   A. Up until the first quarter, we had been pretty much fully
invested. But in early March we became uncomfortable with
valuations. At that point we raised our cash position to 20
percent, which is a lot for this fund ... We started to get back
into the sector in early to mid-April. At that point we felt
overall valuations were attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is the worst of the selling over?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think the true buyers are back in the market, but I
do believe most of the damage has been done. That doesn't mean
things won't be pretty volatile for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few weeks, investors will be focusing on economic
news more than on the fundamentals of these companies. If you
understand the fundamentals of the companies, and they are strong,
you could find some good entry points into a lot of these stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So what have you been buying?
</P>
<P>
   A. Semiconductor stocks are far and away the best value in
technology right now, and currently represent about 35 percent of
the fund's $320 million portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   They were the best performers in the first quarter, rising 68
percent. But from the end of March through May 24, the group fell
22 percent. This is despite rising earnings estimates and a huge
supply shortage ... Our largest semiconductor holdings are Xilinx,
Terradyne, Intel and Applied Materials.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Those are all big companies. Why is that?
</P>
<P>
   A. We have tightened the fund up into the dominant, more liquid
names. As the recovery expands, we will move down in market
capitalization to pick up some bargains.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate the point, at the end of the first quarter, the
median market cap for the stocks in our fund was $49 billion. At
the end of last year it was $21 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Has that strategy paid off?
</P>
<P>
   A. Through Thursday, the fund is down 7.5 percent, so we are
beating the Nasdaq. We have outperformed largely due to the
semiconductor weighting and the fact we have been in larger cap
names.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Which other sectors do you favor?
</P>
<P>
   A. We are overweight in communications equipment stocks. Those
represent about one-third of the fund's assets. Our holdings
include JDS Uniphase and Corning, wireless companies like Nokia,
Motorola and Ericsson and traditional equipment providers like
Telabs, Lucent and Nortel.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You said that earlier this year you were leery of Internet
stocks. Are you still?
</P>
<P>
   A. In general, yes. But over the last week we have been buying
some Internet companies, like BroadVision. They are seeing a lot of
demand from bricks-and-mortar companies who are concerned they are
missing the opportunity to build on the Internet. We also recently
bought some Ariba, the business-to-business software company. And
we own some America Online as well.
</P>
<P>
   We don't own any Yahoo! right now, but I am doing a lot of work
on it. As we get back into the Internet sector, it will probably be
a name we add sooner rather than later. But at more than 225 times
next year's earnings, Yahoo! is pretty pricey.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What advice do you give someone who is just beginning to
invest in technology stocks?
</P>
<P>
   A. For someone starting off, we recommend investing in the
gorillas in each area, the Intels, Microsofts, Nokias, Ciscos and
EMCs of the world. Seek out the core names, because the
fundamentals look great.
</P>
<P>
   One statistic we always throw out is that the United States only
has 5 percent of the world's population but accounts for roughly 45
percent of all technology spending. About 88 percent of the world's
population is in countries that have not been significant spenders
on technology. That is changing.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Just a few years ago Moscow seemed a natural venue for
this week's annual International PEN Congress, an event that has
drawn writers from around the world pledged to fight the good fight
for freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Russian writers, some of them heroes of past PEN
campaigns, were still giddy from the collapse of communist
censorship, and their Western colleagues were eager to honor the
young Russian PEN club, founded in 1992, and boost its status as a
beachhead for Russia's new freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the glow from those early years of democratic euphoria has
faded. Russia is no longer in fashion among Western intellectual
circles. Quite the contrary, Russia is back in the dock, this time
on trial not for communist repression but for a brutal war in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-month war, Russia's second in the region, initiated by
President Vladimir Putin when he was prime minister and largely
supported by public opinion, cast a pall over preparations for the
first PEN Congress to be held in Moscow. As writers and
intellectuals reacted with horror to stories of indiscriminate
bombing, rape and pillage by Russian troops, several national PEN
centers protested against holding the Congress in Moscow and
threatened to withdraw their delegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had serious concerns about the Moscow conference, since
there is no tradition of the PEN club organizing its congress in a
country which is waging war,'' said Adam Pomorski, vice president
of the Polish PEN club. ``With our presence, we could demonstrate
support for one side or another in the conflict. It would be the
same as if, let us say, we had held a congress in Belgrade during
the conflict in Bosnia or Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The final decision to go ahead with the congress, which ends
here on Sunday, was made by the Russian PEN club, whose members
have also vigorously protested the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were certain that in order to uphold the ideals of PEN,
it was in fact essential to hold the conference in Moscow,'' said
Jane Spender, secretary of PEN International. ``To withdraw at this
point would have left the Russian PEN center painfully exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   So the conference has unfolded this week, with delegates from 74
of the International PEN's 130 centers present and the war in
Chechnya getting much attention. Friday the congress' official
delegates adopted a resolution, drafted by the Russian PEN center,
condemning the Russian government's attempts to ``resolve the
tragic situation in Chechnya by military means.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on the agenda was a much more strongly worded declaration,
drafted by PEN centers from Central Europe and the former Soviet
Union, accusing Russia of genocide in Chechnya and of clamping down
on independent news media that have resisted the government's
propaganda line.
</P>
<P>
   In an opening speech, Gunter Grass, the German novelist and
Nobel laureate, called on the Russian government to end ``the war
against the Chechen people,'' which he said had been waged ``once
again, as earlier, without reason without mercy.'' He also called
for a United Nations investigation into war crimes committed by
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   But mainly he appealed to writers to speak out against tyranny,
and to expose lies. Writers, he said, were often the first to
resist ``the changing ideological temptations of the 20th
century,'' whether in Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia. Literature, he
said, ``does not turn a blind eye, it does not forget, it does
break the silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Grass' speech and the focus on Chechnya have received mixed
reviews in Moscow, where some Russian writers and newspapers have
begun to chafe at what they see as the West's relentless criticism
_ and not only of the war _ which some feel has taken on a hostile,
anti-Russian tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I too am outraged by the war in Chechnya, but now the word
Soviet is being replaced by the word Russian, and I also don't like
it,'' said Andrei Bitov, a renowned Russian writer and president of
the Russian PEN center. ``I feel there is a certain nostalgia for
the `enemy' and a lowering of the Iron Curtain from the other
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Bitov, author of ``Pushkin House'' and other novels, said he
first began to sense a shift in attitudes last year, when on his
trips abroad he found himself being made to answer for Russia's
stance against NATO's war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I don't like is that as a private person, I was made to
feel responsible,'' he said. ``There is a kind of snobbism to some
of the criticism, and this readiness to call everyone a fascist.''
</P>
<P>
   The most outrageous example, Bitov noted, came at a PEN
conference at which Lev Timofeyev, a Russian dissident who in
Soviet times spent 10 years in jail, was told that to hold the PEN
congress in Moscow now would be like holding it in Hitler's
Germany. ``This is not a fascist country,'' Bitov said.
</P>
<P>
   Several Russian writers said that the local PEN center had
received ``hints'' from the Russian authorities that the
International PEN Conference might turn into an unwelcome
``political provocation'' that might best be avoided. In the end
nothing was done to prevent its being held here this week, but the
Russian government, unlike the governments of other host countries,
also did nothing to support it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in Russian PEN have become hostages of East and West at the
same moment,'' Bitov said. ``But the great thing is that we managed
to have the congress anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   For some Russian writers who still remember the days when
anonymous censors could strike words and phrases from their books,
or even ban them altogether, holding the conference here, and
airing criticism of the Russian government's conduct of the Chechen
war, is what PEN is all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is right that this conference should be about Chechnya, and
it is right that it should be held here,'' said Andrei Voznesensky,
a poet and vice president of Russian PEN. ``It is a war that
worries foreigners, and it worries us. But it is a good thing that
they can come here and we can all say what we think.''

ONCE-TROUBLED EAST ASIA NOW SHOWS SURPRISING BOOM IN ECONOMIC
GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Less than three years after a plunge in the value of
Thailand's currency triggered a devastating economic crisis across
much of East Asia, the region is riding a wave of growth
reminiscent of the Asian miracle of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The latest evidence of the resurgence came Friday with a report
that Hong Kong's economic output rose 14.3 percent in the first
three months of the year. It was the territory's fastest quarter of
growth since late 1987, and seemed to make the Asian crisis a
distant memory.
</P>
<P>
   Other East Asian economies, from South Korea to Singapore, are
growing at rates much faster than the most optimistic forecasters
had predicted _ largely powered by a booming demand for Asian
exports of computers, electronics, machinery and textiles into the
hot economy of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Salomon Smith Barney investment bank
raised its full-year forecast for East Asia's regional growth to
6.9 percent from 6.7 percent. This week, Salomon raised it again,
to 7.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. economy is showing absolutely no signs of slowing,
which is great for Asia,'' said Simon L. Ogus, an independent
economist here. ``The longer the U.S. keeps booming, the faster
Asia will grow.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ogus and other economists also warn that any downturn in the
U.S. economy could ripple harshly through Asia. They note that
stock markets in Asia have tumbled recently on worries about rising
interest rates and a possible future slowdown in demand from the
United States. Moreover, Japan, the biggest economy in the region,
is still trapped in a prolonged slump.
</P>
<P>
   But it is clear that East Asian countries have defied the
skeptics, who said the region would need a long convalescence from
two years of painful economic contraction, plunging asset values
and wholesale corporate insolvencies.
</P>
<P>
   The spreading rebound is good news for both the U.S. Treasury
Department and the International Monetary Fund, which had come
under heavy criticism in Congress and academia for mismanaging the
approximately $100 billion bailout of troubled Asian economies. The
critics charged that Treasury and the IMF prescribed a mix of
radical economic restructuring and fiscal austerity that threatened
to seriously prolong recessions in the region and leave millions
jobless.
</P>
<P>
   East Asia's stronger-than-anticipated rebound has largely
silenced those complaints. At the same time, however, it has also
lessened the pressure on East Asian governments to clean up the
debt-ridden banks and corporations that contributed to the crisis
in the first place.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I think we'll get surprised further on the upside by Asian
economic growth, which will have the effect of reducing the
pressure for structural reform,'' Ogus said.
</P>
<P>
   Enthusiasm about the East Asian recovery began earlier this
year, when South Korea started posting double-digit year-on-year
gains in growth, putting the severe slump that began in late 1997
firmly behind it. South Korea's strong performance has also been
accompanied by progress in restructuring its most debt-ridden
conglomerates, though some economists still criticize the pace of
reform in that nation as too slow.
</P>
<P>
   In Thailand, generally regarded as the domino that set off the
Asian crisis with the devaluation of its baht currency in July
1997, the IMF decreed in a review two weeks ago that the recovery
``has turned out to be impressive: output growth this year is set
once again to exceed four percent, exports are growing rapidly, the
balance of payments position remains strong, and inflation is well
under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia, which flouted the IMF's prescriptions and imposed
strict controls on its currency and capital flows, has turned into
one of the region's export stars. After growing at 5.4 percent in
1999, Salomon Smith Barney predicts, Malaysia's economy will expand
7 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Indonesia, widely regarded as the most fragile of the
East Asian economies ravaged by the crisis, growth is expected to
exceed 3 percent this year, although the government has said it
could fall to 1.5 percent if political instability persists. Unlike
its neighbors, Indonesia is still spurned by foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, talk of economic reform in East Asia has all-but
vanished as export-led growth has returned with more shipments of
clothes, toys and machinery. Hong Kong's exports rose 20.7 percent
in the first quarter, as it shipped more goods to China, the United
States, Europe, and other Asian countries. China, which uses Hong
Kong as a source for raw materials such as unfinished leather,
cotton and electronics components, was a particularly good
customer.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts noted that Hong Kong's dramatic growth is partly a
reflection of its poor performance in the same quarter last year,
when output declined 3 percent. But they still said Hong Kong's
performance is remarkable, given that its currency is linked the
United States dollar at a fixed exchange rate. The export success
of other Asian countries, notably Malaysia, can be attributed in
part to their weaker currencies, which makes their goods cheaper
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hong Kong economy turned out a spectacular performance,''
said the government's chief economist, K.Y. Tang. ``Looking into
future months, we still see strong demand for our exports.''
</P>
<P>
   Tang said Hong Kong would be further strengthened by the vote in
the House of Representatives on Wednesday to grant permanent normal
trade status to China, which the Senate is also expected to
approve. That step will ease Beijing's entry into the World Trade
Organization, which Hong Kong estimates will add 5 percent to its
gross domestic product over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer run, a more open China could rob this former
British colony of its traditional role as a middleman between China
and the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   But few economists are thinking beyond this year. Following the
lead of private economists, Tang revised his official forecast of
Hong Kong's full-year growth to 6 percent from 5 percent. He said
the revision was conservative because he harbored nagging worries
about how long the economic boom in the United States would last.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a more distinct moderation in the U.S. economy,
somehow - directly or indirectly - the Hong Kong economy will be
affected,'' Tang said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ogus is more emphatic about the damage East Asia would suffer
from a slowdown in the United States. Given that so much of the
region's rebound has hinged on exports, he said Asia's recovery
would come to an abrupt halt if demand from the United States
diminished. At that point, he said, the lack of progress among
Asian countries in overhauling their financial sectors could come
back to haunt them.
</P>
<P>
   East Asia's stock markets reflect this sensitivity to the
outlook across the Pacific. Fears of interest rate increases in the
United States drove down markets everywhere Friday, with the
exception of Taipei, Bangkok and Manila.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in South Korea plunged 6.13 percent after Hyundai, the
country's biggest conglomerate, asked its main creditor for loans
to avert a cash shortage. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index
declined 1.4 percent to its lowest level in six months, despite the
buoyant economic numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong has also not emerged from the deflationary spiral that
has pummeled the prices of everything from apartments to luxury
goods. The local consumer price index fell 4.9 percent in the first
four months of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   One unexpected bright spot in Hong Kong's economic picture was a
surge in investment in computers and other information technology.
After the ascent and crash of Internet-related stocks here, there
is now evidence that Hong Kong is investing in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This reflects a basic change in attitude toward the new
economy here,'' said Ian K. Perkin, the chief economist of the Hong
Kong General Chamber of Commerce. ``It's a belated response to
what's been going on in the United States.''

 &HT;    Tapes reveal LBJ's post election struggles By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Just inaugurated to his own term after the biggest
landslide in presidential election history, Lyndon B. Johnson in
January 1965 dominated the American political landscape and was
pushing forward with his Great Society program.
</P>
<P>
   But tape-recorded conversations released Friday show that
Johnson already was feeling the pressure of the increased fighting
in Vietnam. At the same time, he was trying to quell racial
disharmony in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   The LBJ Library on Friday issued a set of 27 cassette tapes
covering about 28 hours of telephone conversations that Johnson had
recorded while serving in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes include conversations in January through March 1965,
when American ground troops were first sent into South Vietnam and
local and state law enforcement officers in Alabama attacked a
civil rights march at Selma.
</P>
<P>
   The decision Johnson faced on March 6 was whether to approve the
military's request to send Marines to guard an American air base at
Danang from Viet Cong attacks. In February U.S. facilities in
Vietnam had been attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, Johnson, in a conversation with Defense Secretary
Robert McNamara, approved the request.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than have it said, `Well, we wanted protection for our
planes, he wouldn't give it to us,' my answer is yes, but my
judgement's no,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Before giving his answer Johnson told McNamara of his concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the dangers are maybe 60-40 against our getting
involved in a big war with them, the Marines fighting with the Viet
Cong and really starting a land war,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``the psychological impact of `the Marines are
coming' is going to be a bad one; and I know enough to know that.
And I know every mother's going to say, `Uh-oh, this is it.' And I
know what we've done with these B-57s is just going to be Sunday
school stuff compared to the Marines, and all they're going to do
is be a policeman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Damned if I don't know why we can't find some kind of
policeman besides the Marines, because a Marine is a guy that's got
his dagger in his hand and that's going to put the flag up,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson told McNamara to emphasize to the public that the
Marines were going in as a security force.
</P>
<P>
   The president's doubts about Vietnam _ and fears of using
Marines _ may have been stoked by an earlier conversation on March
6 with Sen. Richard Russell, a Georgia Democrat who Johnson had
cultivated in the 1950s as his mentor and a father figure while
serving with him in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Russell warned him that ``these Marines, they'll be killing a
whole lot of friendly Vietnamese. They're going to shoot at
everything that comes around those airplanes. They've been trained
to do that, and that's their business.''
</P>
<P>
   Replied Johnson: ``Dick, the trouble is, with this finally, the
great trouble I'm under _ a man can fight if he can see daylight
down the road somewhere. But there ain't no daylight in Vietnam.
There's not a bit. The more bombs you drop, the more nations you
scare, the more people you make mad.''
</P>
<P>
   On the same day Johnson decided to send Marines to Vietnam, he
was briefed by Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach on the attack
by Alabama law enforcement officers on civil rights marchers at
Selma.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. responded by vowing to lead
another march, from Selma to Montgomery. Johnson then began
pressing Alabama Gov. George Wallace to ensure the safety of the
marchers.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone conversation on March 18 with Johnson, Wallace
complained that protestors were coming in from all over the
country: `They are flying in nuns, priests and we got hundreds of
bearded beatniks in front of my capitol.''
</P>
<P>
   King led the peaceful march on March 25, but a civil rights
worker, Viola Liuzzo, was killed as she returned marchers to Selma.
Vietnam weighed heavily on Johnson, but his earthy and sometimes
profane humor is also on display on the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good God I'd rather (hear) your voice than hear Jesus this
morning. How you feeling?'' he told Russell.

TONY AREFIN, 38, INFLUENTIAL GRAPHIC DESIGNER
</HEADLINE>
 By STEVEN HELLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tony Arefin, a self-taught graphic designer and art
director of periodicals, art catalogs and advertising who was
responsible for influential ad designs like the handwritten look of
the current IBM ``magic box'' campaign, died on May 19 at St.
Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, his wife, Amanda, said. Arefin was
38.
</P>
<P>
   Arefin successfully straddled the often polarized worlds of
magazines and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an art director who thought like an editor,'' said Chee
Pearlman, former editor of ID magazine, who hired Arefin as
creative director in 1993. ``He could write smart headlines as well
as reduce complex subjects into clear visual forms.''
</P>
<P>
   Abed Arefin was born in Karachi, Pakistan. He was later
nicknamed Tony by his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Arefin moved with his family to Bangladesh, and in 1974 during
political strife there, moved to London. He left school early and
worked at various unskilled jobs that motivated him to improve.
</P>
<P>
   By chance, while working on a movie, Arefin was offered a job as
a curator at the Photography Gallery in London, where he organized
a retrospective exhibition of the popular magazine The Face,
designed by Neville Brody. Arefin credited Brody, whom he also
hired to design art catalogs, with indirectly helping Arefin
realize that he should pursue graphic design as a career.
</P>
<P>
   Arefin started designing his own art catalogs. He proved to have
a talent for typography and became so prolific that the design
critic Rick Poynor wrote in the British magazine Blueprint that
Arefin was ``single-handedly processing the print needs of the
entire British art scene.''
</P>
<P>
   ID magazine sent Arefin to New York. His work in New York drew
on everything that interested him, from polished professionalism to
street art.
</P>
<P>
   While he worked on ID he was also art director of Bomb, an arts
magazine, and Blind Spot, an art photography quarterly. He found
magazines too limited in terms of audience and earnings, however.
Leaving his wife and their two young sons in New York, he accepted
an offer from the advertising agency Wieden &AMP; Kennedy in Portland,
Ore., to become an art director for the Microsoft brand.
</P>
<P>
   Arefin also created a striking print campaign for Nike,
introducing its ``I can'' theme.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a good working relationship at Wieden, Arefin returned
to New York after two years.
</P>
<P>
   Arefin joined Ogilvy &AMP; Mather as associate creative director and
senior partner, and worked most recently on the IBM ``magic box''
campaign. By using handwritten lettering scrawled over monumental
photographs of the ``box,'' which is a computer network server, he
gave the product a human aura.
</P>
<P>
   He also worked as a creative director on the Lotus Notes ``I Am
Superman'' campaign, which pulled individuals out of crowds to
indicate the personal nature of the product.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Arefin is survived by two sons, Rafi,
11, and Sami, 9, of New York; his parents, Shamsul and Abeda, and a
sister, Ayesha, all of London.

ANALYSIS: WHY HOUSE BACKED CLINTON ON CHINA TRADE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: inserts 4 new grafs after 19th graf; pick up original 20th
graf `John J. Sweeney ...') 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The most important foreign policy vote so far this
year, the 237-197 House vote to approve of the China trade deal,
was no new affirmation of internationalism by an often provincial
Congress, but a reaffirmation of one of its oldest truths: members
vote their districts.
</P>
<P>
   That is, they vote their districts if their constituents have an
interest, and a trade bill is a singular foreign policy measure
because the question of jobs gained and lost commands attention
from lawmakers and constituents ordinarily not much concerned about
the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But other foreign policy matters have far smaller
constituencies, and are much more subject to Washington's political
influences, especially partisanship. To put it meanly, each party
plays politics with foreign policy; to put it kindly, each trusts
presidents of its own party but discerns grave weaknesses on the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the ``internationalist'' Republicans who supported
President George Bush's Persian Gulf war suddenly became
``isolationist'' Republicans who opposed President Clinton over
military action in Somalia (where Bush actually had sent the the
troops), as well as in Bosnia and Kosovo. The Democrats, meanwhile,
eagerly seized the labels the Republicans had dropped.
</P>
<P>
   There are some members of Congress who take the
``internationalist'' view on trade, intervention abroad, United
Nations funding and comparable issues regardless of party, at least
most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   But looking at a dozen key votes dating back to the Gulf War,
there are only 10 current House members who voted that way all the
time. Several are Southern Democrats with no union pressure over
trade to worry about. Two are Democrats from Washington state,
where union desires to sell Boeing airplanes to China overcome all
other trade questions. And one is a moderate Republican, Rep.
Connie Morella from the suburbs of Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   But most representatives rise or fall on domestic records, and
for them ``foreign policy is totally unimportant most of the
time,'' said Dr. Barbara Bardes, a political scientist at the
University of Cincinnati. ``They are available for those swing
votes as long as it doesn't hurt them.''
</P>
<P>
   And more of them are available these days because two factors
encouraging instinctive support of a president no longer matter.
</P>
<P>
   One was the Cold War, which drew the argument that the United
States would seem weak to the Soviet Union if the president could
not enforce his foreign policy views, even in areas of no concern
to the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   A second is the departure of the World War II generation from
Congress. Only nine veterans of that war now serve in the House.
The Senate has lost the voice of Bob Dole, who could tell his
colleagues that once the president had made a decision, even a weak
one, he must be supported.
</P>
<P>
   The ``sort of `president knows best' attitude is gone,'' said
another student of congressional behavior on foreign policy, James
McCormack, an Iowa State University political scientist.
</P>
<P>
   It has been replaced by the skeptical veterans and non-veterans
of the Vietnam War era, for whom ``the commander-in-chief thing
doesn't work,'' said Bardes. ``They are worried about becoming too
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude produces resolutions demanding withdrawal of
troops from Bosnia and Kosovo, delays in appropriations for drug
wars in Colombia, and, at its most intense level, Senate rejection
of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The consequence is that, ``given the polarization of the
parties, almost any major initiative requires a major effort'' by
the president, said Bob Pastor, a political scientist at Emory
University.
</P>
<P>
   This China trade bill got that intense effort, not just from the
administration, but from business and House Republicans, too.
</P>
<P>
   But without outside allies of the weight of the business
interests that backed this bill, the administration lost the
nuclear test treaty and faces continual difficulties in getting the
money to pay back dues to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   That effort was required because even if this was fundamentally
a trade bill, where most of the votes depended on jobs gained for
Florida fertilizer mills or lost to textile plants in North
Carolina, it also carried the baggage of a foreign policy measure
about a government whom no one in Congress will defend. This was
not a pure trade measure, like the question of extending lower
tariffs to Chile.
</P>
<P>
   The 57 Republicans who voted ``no'' were primarily motivated by
China's treatment of Christians and political dissidents, plus its
reported espionage activity against the United States. And others
were tempted, doubting the argument that trade would broaden
Chinese society.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., dripped with sarcasm: ``We have been
told wonderful things will flow from expanded trade with China.
Workers' rights will be respected, religious freedom will be
enhanced, and probably Jeffersonian study groups will be popping up
all over China.''
</P>
<P>
   But supporters like Rep. tive Nancy L. Johnson, R-Conn.,
disagreed. She quoted a clergyman, Rev. Daniel Baida Su, who told
the Ways and Means Committee that the deal and membership in the
World Trade Organization obliged ``China to play by the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the process, China will need to strengthen its legal
institutions, train more legal professionals, learn to follow
international legal procedures, and educate its people about the
concept of rights, law and international norms,'' she quopted him
as saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``This process alone is a breakthrough with important
philosophical implications for China as a nation. When a Chinese
realizes he has rights as an investor that government should not
violate, then more likely he will also realize that he has other
rights as a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   But her argument would not have prevailed without the sense in
Congress that more jobs were to be gained than lost, and without
the labor opposition suffering from the label of ``protectionism,''
concerned about saving the jobs of union members at the expense of
the U.S. economy in general.
</P>
<P>
   John J. Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, called the charge of
protectionism ``very unfair.'' He said in an interview: ``We
realize the value of trade with any country. We recognize the
expansion of globalization. But in this new global economy, we must
strive for rules that protect human rights and workers rights and
the environment and not just profits.'' It was the bill itself that
was protectionist, he said, as an ``outright attempt to protect
profits without any concern for human rights and workers' rights.''
</P>
<P>
   That argument was often heard on the House floor. Rep. Janice D.
Schakowsky, D-Ill., said the bill encouraged U.S. companies to take
``advantage of the nearest slave labor conditions and wages.'' That
sort of attack went largely unchallenged. But arguments like those
of Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., prevailed. She saw huge
opportunities for U.S. energy, gas, construction, telecom and
engineering companies in China. ``Not only for New Jersey,'' she
said, ``but for the nation, the bottom line here is that this is a
jobs bill.''

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush continued his political
rehab effort among Catholics Friday, the same day he incurred the
risk of upsetting Texas Republicans by deciding to skip their
upcoming state convention.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spoke briefly from Austin, by satellite, with participants
at the Catholic Press Association meeting in Baltimore. He
customized his usual campaign speech by quoting well-known
Catholics, including Pope John Paul II, the late Cardinal John
O'Connor and the late author C.S. Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   In February _ in an event Democrats love to rehash _ Bush spoke
at Bob Jones University in South Carolina, a school that harbors
strong anti-Catholic sentiments. Bush defended his appearance, but
later told Catholic officials he had missed an opportunity to be
``more clear in dissociating myself from anti-Catholic sentiments
and racial prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   In his Friday speech, Bush said he favors maintaining the
Vatican's ``permanent observer status'' at the United Nations. The
private group Catholics for a Free Choice, which supports abortion
rights, is seeking a formal review of the Holy See's U.N. status,
saying the Vatican's claim to be a state is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some groups have been trying to silence that voice in the
United Nations,'' Bush said, add that ``the position of the current
administration is unclear.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Susan Elbow said the Clinton
administration has never called for any change in the Vatican's
U.N. status.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Jenny Backus
criticized Friday's speech as part of Bush's ``Bob Jones Redemption
Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, the Bush campaign said he will skip the June 15-17
state GOP convention in Houston to campaign in Kentucky and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush, the governor's wife, will speak at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   The news surprised Texas GOP officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party hasn't been officially notified of his intentions,''
GOP spokesman Robert Black said Friday afternoon. ``We are moving
forward with our convention planning. There will be 17,000 Texas
Republicans there, some of Governor Bush's most loyal supporters,
who, if he chooses not to attend, will be disappointed, but will
still be enthusiastically supportive of our governor and ready to
work for him the rest of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   One GOP official privately said the party was shocked by Bush's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when the party was controlled by social
conservatives less loyal to Bush, the governor was snubbed when
then-State Chairman Tom Pauken was named to head the state
delegation to the Republican National Convention in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The current party chair, Susan Weddington of San Antonio, is a
Bush ally. Bush campaign spokesman Ray Sullivan said the decision
to skip the state convention is based solely on efforts to make the
best use of Bush's time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to the governor's record and the many grassroots
activists and supporters in this state, Texas is solidly in the
Bush column,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Travis County GOP Chairman Alan Sager said he saw nothing wrong
with Bush's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not see any payoff for him coming to the state
convention. I agree with those who think he ought to be spending
his time where he needs to shore up his support,'' Sager said.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas Democrats tried to make a big deal of Bush's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is trying to distance himself from the radical
right,'' said state Democratic Chair Molly Beth Malcolm. ``The
Texas Republican Party is the epitome of the extreme right wing and
out of touch with the mainstream concerns and needs of most Texans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Sullivan dismissed Malcolm's comments as ``the
type of partisan political rhetoric that has helped Texas
Republicans elect 29 out of 29 statewide officials, a majority of
the Senate and more than 1,500 local officials across the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm said Vice President Al Gore, the probable Democratic
presidential nominee, has been invited to the Texas Democratic
Convention next month but ``might choose to attend conventions in
other states.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An influential Republican member of the House and a
Democratic senator announced Friday that they would collaborate on
a bipartisan effort to add prescription drug benefits to Medicare
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The effort, by Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., and Sen. Ron Wyden,
D-Ore., alters the politics of the issue in this election year, at
least marginally increasing the chances that Congress can break the
deadlock on Medicare coverage of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a bipartisan, bicameral effort to move on
this issue before the end of this session,'' said Thomas, who has
authority over Medicare as chairman of the Ways and Means
Subcommittee on Health.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Wyden embraced many of the principles endorsed by
House Republicans as the framework for a plan to offer drug
benefits to all 39 million people on Medicare. In return, he got a
commitment from Thomas to support several Democratic goals.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Thomas agreed that drug companies should pay a fee
to the government whenever they develop profitable drugs by
exploiting the fruits of research subsidized by the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   The Thomas-Wyden collaboration is significant for several
reasons. It is one of the first serious efforts by members of
opposing parties to find common ground on Medicare drug benefits.
Until now, President Clinton and Democrats have pushed their
proposals and attacked Republican ideas as inadequate, while
Republicans have belittled the Democratic proposals.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate Democrat expressed concern about possible political
consequences of Friday's announcement, saying, ``This will blur the
lines between Republicans and Democrats on what is one of the
Democrats' best election issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and Wyden are considered experts on health policy. Each
shares the politics of his party leaders and the dominant faction
in his party.
</P>
<P>
   Wyden has a liberal voting record and has long been an advocate
for the elderly. As a young lawyer, he led the Oregon chapter of
the Gray Panthers. He was immersed in health care issues for 15
years as a member of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas has become the point man for House Republicans on health
policy, the person who explains the intricacies of Medicare to
colleagues and to the public. He is an architect of a House
Republican proposal, outlined last month, that would use private
insurance subsidized by the government to help pay drug costs for
the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   John P. Feehery, a spokesman for Speaker Dennis Hastert of
Illinois, described Friday's announcement as ``a welcome
development.'' Congressional aides said the Senate Democratic
leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, had urged Wyden to be cautious
in dealing with the Republicans. But Molly Rowley, a spokeswoman
for Daschle, said the joint effort could ``add some sense of
urgency, some traction and increase the likelihood that legislation
will be passed this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and Wyden said they would not write a bill of their own
but would work with each other to push legislation. In effect, they
have opened a channel for communication and cooperation between the
parties.
</P>
<P>
   The two lawmakers endorsed these principles:
</P>
<P>
   Coverage of prescription drugs should be guaranteed as ``an
entitlement'' to any Medicare beneficiary who wants it. (Democrats
insist on an entitlement.)
</P>
<P>
   Medicare drug benefits should be supervised by the Department of
Health and Human Services but probably not by the Health Care
Financing Administration, the much criticized agency that now runs
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The government should help pool the purchasing power of Medicare
beneficiaries so they can obtain discounts on drugs, like the
discounts negotiated by health maintenance organizations and other
big buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The government should pay most of the drug costs of people with
very high drug expenses. This subsidy would reduce premiums for
everyone, by reducing the total costs that must be covered by
premiums.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should discuss drug prices as an issue in
trade negotiations with Canada and other countries that regulate
such prices. Such discussions might find ways to reduce the
disparities, thus reducing the incentive for United States
residents to cross the border to get less costly drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, the president's health policy coordinator, said
he did not know enough about the Thomas-Wyden effort to comment.
``I don't think there are any details,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and Wyden did not say what premiums would be charged for
drug coverage. They did agree that some of the cost should be
defrayed by drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chairman Thomas, for the first time, has agreed to require
that drug companies pay a return-on-investment fee to the Medicare
trust fund when they profit from government-funded research,''
Wyden said. ``Again and again, taxpayers have put up the dollars to
fund the critical early research that brings blockbuster drugs to
the market. It's only fair that these taxpayer investments be
recognized through compensation by the company to our government.''

 &HT;    Techno granny e-mails spiritual message
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Jo Beckham's frail, age-spotted hands work
nimbly on the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   At 95, the woman once crowned the Pioneer Queen of Lamesa,
Texas, is running an e-mail ministry from the Buckner Villas
retirement home in Northeast Austin. Beckham uses her ministry to
encourage others more than half her age that faith can be fun as
well as inspirational.
</P>
<P>
   Her computer savvy gives her a worldwide window and the
opportunity to share the gospel as far away as Cambodia, Romania,
Hungary, India and Singapore. And she joins thousands of Christians
_ many of them senior citizens _ who are using the Internet as a
mission tool.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. James A. Andrews, 75, of Burnet recently launched the
interdenominational First Internet Outreach Church site to reach
shut-ins, seniors and youth who feel disenfranchised from
traditional churches.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews said he does not want to replace anyone's home church,
but rather augment their spiritual lives and reach out to those who
suffer from disabilities and have trouble attending churches.
</P>
<P>
   Beckham and Andrews said the best part about the computer is at
can be used at one's convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Beckham, a Southern Baptist, plans to keep her ministry a simple
one-on-one experience, offering up prayers, sending out devotionals
and sharing conversation with anyone who is interested. She
initially came in contact with missionaries through a granddaughter
who runs a ministry for the deaf in Hungary. One missionary told
another and her global e-mail list began to take off.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she has more than 80 folks on her ever-expanding e-mail
address list. Unlike Andrews, she has never ventured onto the Web,
saying she doesn't see that as advancing her ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, she sends out her ``Footprints,'' a short devotional
message that features Scripture, parodies, rewritten song words,
poems and uplifting prose to brighten the day. Her goal, she said,
is to spread God's word.
</P>
<P>
   Beckham accepts prayer requests from anyone in need, including a
group of bachelors she says are looking for a ``WOG.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That means Woman of God,'' she said with laughter. Beckham
never knows when one of those requests might pop up. Even the man
who fills her oxygen tank and regularly keeps in touch through
e-mail asked her to pray that he find ``a good Christian female to
share my life with,'' according to one message.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Hyde, who lives in Cambodia, said in an e-mail interview
that Beckham is an uplifting influence in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Cambodia, I am involved in leadership training and
publishing Christian books,'' Hyde said. ``I also run the only
Christian book store in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I were married a little more than a year ago and
Jo wrote us a song for our wedding. My wife and I were so touched
by that.''
</P>
<P>
   Though most of the missionaries know Beckham by e-mail only,
Hyde met her two years ago when he brought a child to Austin.
Beckham's son, Patrick, is an Austin doctor who operated on the
child's cleft lip.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting Beckham, Hyde said, ``left a deep impression on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckham's ministry headquarters is a cozy, single room with
country-style decorations and pictures made by her
great-grandchildren. Room and office are one in the same, and she
keeps it well organized.
</P>
<P>
   On her bed are her fruit-of-the-month boxes (another gift from a
grandchild) packed with ministry brochures and Bible tracts she
prints out on her computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to put things in boxes and keep them organized because
when you get to be my age you get a little forgetful,'' Beckham
said.
</P>
<P>
   On weekends and holidays, workers at the retirement home bring
their children to Beckham's room where she holds a Bible study
class.
</P>
<P>
   Beckham said she plans to keep spreading the gospel, praying for
those in need and offering up some joy for as long as the good Lord
keeps her on earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She quickly quoted a verse from Isiah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not unto us be the praise. Let the Lord be glorified.''

VASSER WANTS TO MILK HIS TIME AT INDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ When he won the inaugural US 500 in 1996 _ an
event Championship Auto Racing Teams staged as a boycott to the
fledgling Indy Racing League and its flagship event, the
Indianapolis 500 _ Jimmy Vasser pulled into Victory Lane at
Michigan International Speedway and uncorked a bottle of champagne.
</P>
<P>
   He then made his own political statement concerning the
fractious CART-IRL split when he mocked Indy's traditional nectar
of victory and defiantly remarked, ``Who needs milk?''
</P>
<P>
   For the last five years, though, Vasser has thirsted for a
sloppy swig of ice cold milk on Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   So when car owner Chip Ganassi decided to field IRL cars for
Vasser and Team Target stablemate Juan Montoya, the defending
champion of the CART FedEx Championship Series, Vasser feared the
words that spilled from his tongue in Michigan would come back to
haunt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully expected to be dodging tomatoes when we came back,''
Vasser said.
</P>
<P>
   But, to almost everyone's pleasant surprise, that hasn't been
the case. There have been no projectiles to dodge and no catcalls
to ignore. Instead, Ganassi's Gladiators, winners of the last four
FedEx championships, have been bestowed with bouquet upon bouquet
of flowering praise for their return to the Brickyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone here holds Chip, Juan, and Jimmy in high regards,''
said 1999 IRL champion Greg Ray, whose four-lap average of 223.471
miles per hour knocked Montoya (223.372) from the pole position
during last Saturday's time trials. ``They didn't win four CART
championships by accident, you know? They're a damn good team with
two damn good drivers and having them here is good for the fans,
it's good for the media, and it's good for the race, because, at
the end of the day, if you're playing in the sandbox, you want to
make sure all your competition is in the sandbox with you so you
can say you beat the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a discouraging word has been uttered or written about
Team Target/Ganassi's much-anticipated return. In fact, the
harshest thing anyone has said or written has been by local scribe,
Robin Miller of the Indianapolis Star, who jokingly dubbed Team
Target as ``The Red Devils.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys are the ones who are making that up,'' Ganassi said.
``I'm telling you, my guys are out there signing autographs more
than anybody and, yeah, they got a job to do and that's what
they're doing. But nobody is out here flying (CART) flags or
wanting to be the `Red Devils' or anything like that. We just want
to be the target, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, that's precisely what Vasser and Montoya will be to
the rest of the 33-car field when they fire the engines of their
Target-sponsored cars for the start of the 84th Indianapolis 500.
However, it will be their second race in as many days after
competing in Saturday's Bosch Spark Plug Grand Prix CART race at
Nazareth, Pa., which was snowed out April 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest part of doing this is thinking through all the
limitations _ the physical limitations of people and equipment,''
said Ganassi, who reportedly spent $1.7 million to hire a separate
crew of engineers and fabricators to work on his IRL program in his
palatial 70,000-square foot garage here. ``It's a pretty daunting
thing, in this day in racing. It's a pretty bold effort to go into
another formula, I don't care what formula it is. All formulas
whether it's IRL or CART or NASCAR or supermodifieds at Oswego,
when you get to that one level, it's very specialized. The question
is always, `Are you going to be able to adapt to those nuances?' ''
</P>
<P>
   So what are the differences between the open-wheel cars Montoya
and Vasser drive on the CART circuit and those they will man in
Saturday's IRL-sanctioned race?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well the horsepower is the biggest thing, for starters,''
Vasser said. ``You definitely can feel in the acceleration and
getting up to speed and if get out of the power, getting back on
the power and the response. I think there's like nearly 250
horsepower less and it's heavier in the back, so the car feels to
me like it has a kind of a pendulum motion after turning that kind
of swings around through the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than that, for me behind the wheel, you know, there's a
lot more similarities than there are differences.''
</P>
<P>
   The undisputed star pupil among the class of seven rookie
starters is Montoya, who quickly adapted to his IRL car when it
took him all of four laps to work up to 217 m.p.h. on his first day
on the track. During his qualification run, he blistered the track
with a warm-up lap of 221 m.p.h., before taking the provisional
pole with a four-lap average of 223.372.
</P>
<P>
   The brash 24-year-old native of Bogota has remained nonplussed
by the Speedway's daunting size or the weightiness of its rich
legacy. But that is not to say that he has been disrepectful of the
Speedway. He, like Vasser, is glad to finally have the chance to
race here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single fan here has been really good, and the drivers
and teams also,'' said Montoya. ``What really makes this place so
special is all the people. This is a really friendly area with all
the people, especially those `Alley Cats.' Have you seen them?
They're great.''
</P>
<P>
   Vasser acknowledged winning the US 500 four years ago had a
bittersweet feeling because he knew his team was good enough that
day to win the Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've won a few 500-mile races and qualified up front at just
about every one of them,'' said Vasser, who will start in the third
row in the No. 7 starting position. ``Ever since I've been with
Chip's team, we've probably been most competitive and most
consistent in 500-mile races at superspeedways. Certainly we've
missed some opportunities to be (an Indy) 500 champion two times or
maybe even three times, but we can never get those back and I
understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never really taken a hard-line stance against the IRL or
for CART. I've always wanted to race here and I felt like this is
the place that you can hang your hat on for the rest of your
life.''

KRAFT'S CHIEF CHEERLEADER AND CHEESE WHIZ

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHFIELD, Ill. _ Betsy D. Holden, the new chief executive at
Kraft Foods, never disguised her ambitions for such a post, and
never saw her sex as an obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in college, I said I really want to run a business
and I want to be CEO,'' she said in an interview at Kraft's
sprawling headquarters in this Chicago suburb.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, at the age of 44, Holden was granted her wish when
she was named to the position that makes her one of the highest
ranking women in corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   Only Carly Fiorina, the chief executive at Hewlett-Packard, runs
a bigger operation. Holden, a 16-year veteran of Kraft, a unit of
Phillip Morris, now heads the nation's largest food packager, with
more than $18 billion in revenue and some of the world's most
recognizable brands, such as Jello, Oscar Mayer, Maxwell House, and
Kraft cheese.
</P>
<P>
   But Holden, who stands 5-foot-4, does not want her gender to
receive too much attention. ``Sometimes, there's more emphasis put
on the fact that you're a woman than results,'' she says, standing
outside the door to her newly decorated executive suite. ``At the
end of the day, it's the results that count.''
</P>
<P>
   Holden has zoomed up the ranks at Kraft by delivering big
results, even while making her workplace more friendly for other
women. She was the head of Kraft's pizza division from 1993 to
1995, when Tombstone became a national brand and DiGiorno was
launched. In a business viewed as mature, she achieved record sales
and profit growth. Promoted to lead the cheese division, she became
known around the company as the ``Cheese Whiz.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been a rising star in the industry,'' said John
McMillin, a food analyst at Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Texas on her brother's second birthday and
delivered by her own father, a former military flight surgeon who
later settled the family near Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, she was a cheerleader and a student council
member. She studied education at Duke, and graduated summa cum
laude.
</P>
<P>
   Children and teaching, she says, have always been her passion.
So she briefly taught fourth-grade before entering Kellogg Graduate
School of Management at Northwestern University. ``I loved the kids
and it was very fulfilling,'' she said of her teaching. ``But I was
looking for something to combine the creative and the analytical.''
</P>
<P>
   At Kellogg, she was a standout, and was named valedictorian and
outstanding marketing student. She worked first at General Foods
before moving to Kraft in 1984. ``Kraft was very good to me,'' she
says. ``Any time my learning curve started to falter, I was moved
along.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft executives were impressed by her teamwork, competitive
drive and inventiveness.
</P>
<P>
   As a teacher, she created learning games for children, even
working part-time for Milton Bradley. She applied that same
inventiveness, colleagues say, to building Kraft's brands.
</P>
<P>
   She even invented cheers for her Kraft team, something her
colleagues kid her about. An example can be seen outside her
office: a framed picture shows an image of her face pasted onto a
cheerleader's body, under the signature cheer Holden created for
the cheese division: ``Every day and every way, grow Kraft cheese,
hey!''
</P>
<P>
   Holden also had a knack for organization, even regimentation.
She charted, listed, categorized and logically plotted not just her
rise to power, but her family life.
</P>
<P>
   She's not a workaholic, she says. But she has mastered the
balance between work and the rest of her life by setting priorities
and finding activities that fulfill many of her different
interests, like her volunteer work with the Off the Street Club, a
boys and girls club for impoverished children in a tough part of
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The club gets financial support from the marketing community in
Chicago, so it's a way for her to network, teach, and spend time
with her own children, a son, age 12, and a daughter, 9, as she
invites many of the other children to her home for sleepovers.
</P>
<P>
   Holden still teaches Sunday School, along with her husband,
Arthur, the chief executive of a local company that is mapping the
human genome. When she became a mother she organized a group of
women at Kraft to form WOMEN (Working Mom's Exchange Network), a
group that delegated to its members everything from researching
pre-schools to writing wills.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Holden is delegating much larger duties. She says Kraft
wants to be the ``undisputed leader of the food industry,'' an
industry with a slowing growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft, however, has outperformed most of its peers. Analysts
speculate that Kraft could make a bid for Nabisco, or that Philip
Morris could spin Kraft off as an independent company, but Holden
declines comment.
</P>
<P>
   Her task, she says, is to cut costs, make acquisitions, come up
with innovative marketing plans and further expand into nutritional
foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do is look at the aging population and
genomics,'' she says. ``In a year or two you'll be able to get a
genetic profile of yourself, and be able to alter your diet.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft is also focusing on creating more convenient,
ready-to-serve foods for meals and snacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are multi-tasking,'' she says, ``They're feeling
stressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Holden's confidence that only the results of those efforts will
count was bolstered by hearing, after word had spread around Kraft
that she was the new chief, that her gender was not even a topic of
discussion. She also learned that there were several other women
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard that, I said: `Yes!''' she said, pumping her
fist. `` `That's the way it ought to be.'''

CLINTON ANNOUNCES NEW MARINE CONSERVATION PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Hawaii)   By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASSATEAGUE ISLAND, Md. _ Using the sand and surf as a backdrop,
President Clinton on Friday announced new initiatives in an effort
to preserve the United States' fragile shoreline and threatened
coral reefs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton directed the Commerce Department and the Department of
the Interior, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, to
strengthen ocean protections through administrative steps similar
to the ones applied to large tracts of land protected as wilderness
areas. Coming in the final months of his presidency, Clinton's
protections would not require approval by Congress but could be
undone by his successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beach lines and coastlines are now our No. 1 tourist
destination,'' the president said, striding onto the sand on this
barrier island sporting sunglasses, short sleeves and cowboy boots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our oceans, however, are far more than a playground,'' Clinton
continued. ``They have a central effect on the weather, on our
climate system. Through fishing, tourism and other industries,
ocean resources _ listen to this _ support one out of every six
jobs in the United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, who spoke over a roaring surf as sea gulls flew
overhead, directed the Interior and Commerce departments to set up
a system of ``marine protected areas'' to coordinate the hodgepodge
of federal protections now in place for beaches, reefs and other
marine habitats. His order did not specify any areas, but it
requested recommendations on shorelines in need of limits on such
activities as fishing, offshore oil drilling, mining and dumping.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the National Park Service protects 54 different marine
areas that span over 3 million acres of water, including Glacier
Bay in Alaska, the Everglades in Florida, and Assateague, an island
famous for the herds of wild horses that roam its marshlands. Other
marine areas have been set aside as wildlife refuges under
administration of the Fish and Wildlife Service or the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``These different protections have all been fragmented,'' said
David Hayes, deputy secretary of the Interior Department. ``And for
the first time under the executive order, there's going to be a
requirement that the agencies work together and look together at
the protections that we have, and determine whether we need new
protections or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the details remain to be worked out, some commercial
fishermen were nervous that their favorite spots might be declared
off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world is against watermen, and now you have the
world plus the president,'' Freeland Mason, past president of the
Virginia Watermen's Association, told The Associated Press. ``The
conservationists want to cut out all commercial fishing. They don't
want any fishing except by hook and line. The waterman is an
endangered species these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also directed the Environmental Protection Agency to
adopt tougher water-pollution standards to protect beaches and
coastal areas, and to identify areas where additional protections
are required.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to go back and look at their permitting process
for all of the ocean discharges that could have an impact in ocean
areas, and make sure that those are fully scientifically based, and
if necessary, to increase the protection,'' said James Baker,
administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   As it is now, thousands of beaches are closed every year as
heavy rains cause sewers and drains to overflow, washing raw sewage
into the surf. That polluted runoff can cause a variety of health
hazards, including gastroenteritis, dysentery and hepatitis. It
also leads to toxic algal blooms and threatens marine life.
</P>
<P>
   Without better protections, polluted shorelines are expected to
only get worse as nearly half of all development in the United
States occurs along the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also ordered the development of a plan within the next
90 days to protect the coral reefs off a 1,200-mile string of
uninhabited islands in northwest Hawaii. Coral reefs, which harbor
an abundance of marine life, are threatened worldwide from
pollution, overfishing and rising ocean temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawaiian reefs, first protected by Theodore Roosevelt's
creation of the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge, make up
nearly 70 percent of the coral in U.S. waters and support
threatened sea turtles, Hawaiian monk seals and other marine life
found nowhere else on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The president's plan, which will probably increase the zone of
protected coral in the waters off Hawaii, would be developed in
cooperation with Hawaiian authorities, officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In announcing the initiatives, Clinton made both environmental
and economic arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old idea that we can only grow by putting more pollution
into our lakes and rivers and oceans must finally be put to rest,''
he said. ``Indeed it is now clear that we can grow our economy
faster over the long run by improving our environment, and it's
really not enough for us just to try to keep it as it is. We have
to do better.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton has used his executive authority to impose an
array of environmental protections, Congress remains in charge of
the purse strings, and Republican leaders have been reluctant to
fund all of what the president considers critical environmental
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the leadership in Congress is swimming against the
tide,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But Pete Jeffries, communications director for House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, said Clinton is acting unwisely by expanding
protected areas without giving enough resources to the ones already
on the books. ``Republicans want to take a responsible,
common-sense approach to our environment,'' Jeffries said.

AN UNSELFISH ACT THAT REKINDLES SPIRIT OF GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After all the scandal and cynicism of the last 18 months comes a
lovely affirmation of the Olympic spirit from, of all places,
women's taekwondo. When Kay Poe, the world's top-ranked flyweight,
dislocated her kneecap before the finals of last weekend's US
trials, her childhood friend and training partner, Esther Kim,
forfeited the match rather than take a free pass to Sydney. ``If I
won, it wouldn't be fair,'' Kim told Poe before formally
withdrawing. ``It was the most heartfelt moment of my life,'' said
Poe, after she and Kim had hugged at the center of the mat. ``I
don't think it matters who won. We're both winners.'' Turns out
that Kim will go to Sydney after all. Poe is buying her a plane
ticket. And if Poe can't compete (she's sidelined for two months),
Kim gets the spot.

<P>
   A deficit reduction
</P>
<P>
   With more sponsors signing on (21 since Mitt Romney arrived a
year ago February) and more budget cuts, the Salt Lake organizing
committee's deficit has been chopped from $379 million to $83
million. Since SLOC has reserved nearly twice that much for
contingencies, the organizers are easily in the black with the 2002
Games still 21 months off. ``We've gone from the days of
guardrail-to-guardrail,'' said Romney, ``and we're back on track.''
Romney is breathing easier, too, since the US Department of Justice
announced last week that it won't seek an indictment of the SLOC in
the wake of the payoff scandal. Not that it's a surprise _ the
alleged wrongdoing was done by the bid committee, not the
organizing committee. The feds still can go after present or former
members of the committee, though . . . Bad month all around for the
Athens organizers. First, the Lords of the Rings put them on the
in-danger-of-failing list. Then the Olympic flame-kindling ceremony
turned into a fiasco after officials dithered so long that clouds
rolled in and blotted out the sun at Olympia. The torch had to be
ignited from a practice flame. ``How can we be expected to organize
Olympic Games,'' said Athens mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos, ``if we
can't get the ceremony right?'' . . . Off the hook is embattled
International Olympic Committee vice president Kevan Gosper of
Australia, after the committee's ethics panel found that he broke
no rules by letting his wife and children take a subsidized ski
trip to Utah when Salt Lake was bidding for the 2002 Winter Games.
Though the trip was worth much more than Gosper paid, the panel
concluded that he was misled about the cost by the bidders. ``I've
lived through controversy before,'' said Gosper, who's still
catching hell Down Under for letting his 11-year-old daughter be
the first Australian to run with the Olympic torch. ``I'll find my
way through it. Storms come and go.'' The question, though, is
whether there'll still be a lingering black cloud next year, when
Gosper is expected to be one of the prime candidates jockeying for
the IOC presidency when Juan Antonio Samaranch steps down.

   There was joy and heartbreak for local cyclists at last
weekend's Olympic road trials, which both came down to field
sprints on the flat Jackson, Miss., course. Wellesley's Nicole
Freedman came out of the pack to beat Pam Schuster by a length and
a half in the 64-mile women's race to win a ticket to Sydney. And
Norton's Derek Bouchard-Hall was nipped by Antonio Cruz by 6 inches
after 138 miles. ``It's a dream come true,'' said Freedman, a
28-year-old Stanford graduate who transferred from MIT and switched
from distance running to cycling. ``I don't believe it happened.''
The rest of the Olympic berths (four men, two women) will be picked
in July. Still in the chase are Bouchard-Hall, brothers Frank and
Mark McCormack (from Leicester and North Easton), Marblehead's
Tyler Hamilton, and Northampton's Jen Dial. Bouchard-Hall and the
McCormacks will be racing in next week's American Cup Pro/Am series
in six Massachusetts cities and towns. Check www.american-cup.com
for details . . . They were dancing in the streets of Prague and
Bratislava after the Czechs held off the Slovaks to retain their
men's world hockey title. Not that the Czechs were surprised _
they've never lost to their neighbors since Czechoslovakia broke
up. But the Slovaks, who'd never placed higher than seventh, were
ecstatic just to make the final. ``If somebody said before the
tournament we would come in second, we would have laughed,'' said
Slovakia's Lubomir Vaic. The Finns took the bronze ahead of the
Canadians, who left without a medal for the third straight year.
The Americans, beaten, 4-1, by the Slovaks in the quarters, ended
up fifth . . . The pre-Sydney sandbagging has already started
between the US and Australian swimming camps. After the Aussies set
four world marks (three by Ian ``The Thorpedo'' Thorpe) in Olympic
events at their team trials, US national team director Dennis
Pursley claimed that the Yanks would be underdogs at Olympus.
Nonsense, countered Aussie coach Don Talbot. ``It's a way of
transferring pressure onto us,'' he said. ``To tell me that they're
underdogs is just BS. Go ask the rest of the world who's No. 1.
They'll tell you the Americans are.'' Fact is, Talbot's right,
though his squad has all but closed the gap. The US outmedaled
Australia, 26-12, in Atlanta, 24-19 at the 1998 world meet, and
only 35-32 at last year's Pan Pacific meet in Sydney . . . Now that
Mary T. Meagher's 1981 world record in the 200-meter butterfly has
been broken by Susie O'Neill, the oldest Olympic-event mark on the
books is the 4-minute-3.85-second standard in the women's 400
freestyle set by Janet Evans at the 1998 Games in Seoul, a mark
that even Evans never came close to matching. Oldest men's mark is
the 21.81 in the 50 freestyle by Tom Jager in 1990 . . . Odds are
that the Pacific Cup victor will be determined on the first day
when the US women's soccer team plays China Wednesday in Canberra
in the teams' first meeting since last summer's World Cup final at
the Rose Bowl. Whoever earns the most points in the round-robin
format will be the champion, and the rest of the field (Australia,
New Zealand, Canada, Japan) is nowhere near the gold standard.
Except for injured starters Carla Overbeck (knee), Michelle Akers
(shoulder), and Briana Scurry (shin), the Americans will field the
full varsity . . . Off to California (and new coach Frank Carroll)
is skater Tim Goebel, who finished 11th at the world championships
after a stunning split with longtime mentor Carol Heiss Jenkins.
It's a smart move for Goebel, who needs to add polish to his
quad-filled program. Question is, can he handle practicing in the
shadow of three-time world champ Michelle Kwan? . . . That
familiar/unfamiliar face in the high school graduation line last
week belonged to Olympic skating champion Tara Lipinski, who got a
diploma from River Oaks Academy in Houston without ever seeing the
inside of the school. Lipinski, who trained in Michigan, did it all
by tutoring and correspondence. She says she'll eventually attend
college when she can do it ``the right way. I'm not going to take
any basket-weaving,'' said Lipinski.

RICHARD E. NOLAN, LAWYER WHO ADVISED CATHOLIC CHURCH, DIES AT 71 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC V. COPAGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Richard E. Nolan, a lawyer who represented the Roman
Catholic Church in some of the most important court cases involving
religion and government in the last 40 years, died Monday. He was
71 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   He died at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan of complications
from a stroke, said Geoffrey Goldberg of Davis Polk &AMP; Wardwell, the
law firm for which Nolan worked for more than 42 years.
</P>
<P>
   One of Nolan's cases that went to the U.S. Supreme Court
involved a 1980 New York State law requiring that parochial schools
be reimbursed by the state for providing state-mandated educational
services. A challenge to the law contended that it violated the
constitutional separation of church and state. But Nolan's argument
prevailed. He convinced the justices that the law was sound because
it required reimbursement only for statewide standardized services,
not religious education. His victory set the stage for similar laws
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   As a young lawyer, he took part in the unsuccessful battle to
keep organized prayer in public schools. The Supreme Court banned
such prayer in 1962 in its landmark decision in Engel vs. Vitale.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose, however, Nolan was considered a successful
litigator, and his cases laid the foundation for lawsuits that are
being litigated today, said Robert A. Destro, interim dean of the
Columbus School of Law at Catholic University of America in
Washington.
</P>

WHITE HOUSE LOSES AND GAINS IN RULING ON A PRIVACY ACT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs 1st graf to insert `of 1974'; 3rd graf to change `submit to'
to `abide by'; 5th graf to insert `toward her'; 6th graf to change
`supposed sexual advance' to `time she said the advance took
place.') 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal appeals court on Friday refused to
interfere in a lawsuit brought by a group that accuses President
Clinton of violating the Privacy Act of 1974. . But the ruling was
still a partial victory for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The three judges said there was no need to issue an emergency
order sought by the White House to block pre-trial information
gathering, or discovery, in the suit brought by Judicial Watch, a
conservative organization that has been a persistent foe of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, Jim Kennedy, said Friday that White
House lawyers were disappointed by the decision on discovery, but
would abide by it nonetheless. But Kennedy said White House lawyers
were ``very pleased'' by other elements of Friday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals panel sharply criticized a lower court judge who
asserted in a March 29 ruling that the president committed ``a
criminal violation of the Privacy Act'' in releasing personal
letters sent to him by Kathleen Willey, a former White House
volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, Willey accused Clinton on the CBS News program
``60 Minutes'' of making a sexual advance toward her in the fall of
1993. Her account added to the burdens of the president during the
investigation of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and the
sexual-misconduct lawsuit filed by Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Willey's television appearance, the president
released her letters _ reluctantly, he said _ in the hope that
their friendly tone would undercut her accusations. She had written
them after the time she said the advance took place.
</P>
<P>
   Willey is not a party to the suit by Judicial Watch, which
contends that the White House improperly obtained hundreds of files
from the FBI on former appointees and employees of the Reagan and
Bush administrations. Judicial Watch has focused on the handling of
the Willey letters in the hope of uncovering evidence that might
buttress its allegations involving misuse of the FBI files.
</P>
<P>
   On March 29, Judge Royce L. Lamberth ruled that White House
lawyers should submit to questioning by attorneys from Judicial
Watch. He went further, declaring that Clinton had acted unlawfully
in releasing Willey's letters, which were kept among White House
records. The Privacy Act generally bars release of information
about a person from federal records without that person's consent,
and violations of the law can result in fines.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the appeals judges said Lamberth's ``sweeping
pronouncements'' about supposed criminal activity were
inappropriate, ``entirely superfluous'' and not binding on any
court that might have to weigh the question of criminality.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has contended all along that much of its
business is exempt from the Privacy Act, and that many lawyers from
both political parties have long said so. Friday, the appeals
judges said that, in matters unrelated to the Judicial Watch case,
the White House can continue to operate under that assumption
unless and until a court declares otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1987.
Clinton and his allies have made no secret of their feeling that
the judge is unfriendly to the current administration.

 &HT;    Clinton promises protection for coastal areas
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - President Clinton pledged Friday that the federal
government would protect fragile stretches of seas and beaches in a
network of preserves resembling national parks and wilderness
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Over the roar of ocean surf at Assateague Island, Md., Clinton
ordered government agencies to draw up lists of coastal areas and
how they might be protected from fishing, drilling and other human
threats.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative parallels projects to safeguard the Florida Keys'
threatened coral reefs and species.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Keys are a microcosm for what is happening worldwide,''
said Kim Anaston, the Florida Keys project manager for the Center
for Marine Conservation, a Washington-based environmental group
that endorsed Clinton's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The center is among numerous private groups and government
agencies working to turn the 125 miles of Tortugas Bank, south of
the Keys, into an ecological reserve. It would be the largest
undersea preserve in America, and one of the largest in the world.
It would dwarf a patchwork of 23 near-shore preserves already
marked out in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   The United States would join such countries as Australia, New
Zealand, Cuba, Kenya, the Bahamas and Mexico in designating part of
their oceans as parks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sought to bolster the government's commitment, saying he
envisions a network of protected marine areas resembling the
decades-old national parks system.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government already has set aside more than 200
million acres of wilderness and national parks to provide
sanctuaries for wildlife and plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to do more with our seas and our coasts,'' Clinton
said. ``The old idea that we can only grow by putting more
pollution into our lakes and rivers and oceans must finally be put
to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   With millions of Americans living near a coastline, pressures
are mounting from development, pollution, fishing, and oil and gas
drilling, environmental advocates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to preserve our oceans and the wildlife that
resides in them, we need to take some steps that we have not taken
to protect them,'' said Roger Rufe, president of the Center for
Marine Conservation. ``It is long overdue, but it is much
appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   The Interior and Commerce departments would draw up lists of
threatened areas and weigh how best to protect them. Methods could
include bans on fishing, drilling or other activities. Or there
could be milder measures. A new federal office would administer the
process.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government already has administrative power to
impose protections on federal waters and coastline, but it is not
often invoked. Those powers do not extend to private waters.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials questioned Friday whether Clinton's initiative
would have much impact on the Southern coast, beyond the Keys at
Florida's southern tip.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we can tell, it is a statement that he is going to
continue the status quo,'' said Mike Shanahan, spokesman for the
American Petroleum Institute in Washington. ``Everything he is
talking about is already out of bounds for offshore drilling,''
including the issuance of any new East Coast drilling licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Most U.S. oil drilling occurs in the Gulf of Mexico, in areas
Shanahan said are less environmentally sensitive than those found
elsewhere near Florida, especially around the coral reefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is going to have limited relevance to the coastal
Southeast,'' said Howard Marlowe, president of the American Coastal
Coalition, a Washington-based advocacy group representing coastal
communities on issues such as beach renourishment.
</P>
<P>
   Marlowe said coral reefs are limited to the warm waters of
southern Florida, diminishing efforts to preserve those threatened
habitats elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it is limited to the Keys,'' Anaston said, but she
and colleague Marianne Cufong of the Coastal Management Council in
St. Petersburg said Clinton's initiative reaches beyond protecting
coral reefs to species elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Grouper and snapper are among the many south Atlantic species
considered to be overfished, said Cufong, the council's regional
fish conservation manager for the southeastern Atlantic and the
Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can draw your own conclusions from that . . . about
whether there should be a national mandate,'' Cufong said. ``We
favor maritime preserves as a management tool to protect species.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said oceans cover about 70 percent of the Earth's
surface and support all manner of economy and jobs. But, he said,
they are also among the world's endangered places, under siege from
pollution, global warming and other threats.

BULGARIAN PLEADS GUILTY TO COUNTERFEITING CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Canada)   By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Amtrak train to New York rolled into Niagara
Falls last October, customs officers boarded it for a routine
inspection. What they found stacked and wrapped in a newspaper in a
bathroom stall was anything but routine: $200,000 in $100 bills.
</P>
<P>
   That chance find last October led to a counterfeiting ring whose
trail stretched from Queens County, N.Y., through Canada to
Bulgaria, where federal prosecutors say a group of men produced
some of the highest quality fake money now circulating in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the last member of the counterfeiting operation
pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Manhattan to conspiracy to
distribute the $100 bills. Prosecutors said the man, Peter
Simeonov, a native of Bulgaria, was part of a group responsible for
distributing at least $500,000 in counterfeit money in 1999. Five
other men have also pleaded guilty to various charges related to
the case.
</P>
<P>
   After finding the money in the train bathroom, customs officers
alerted the Secret Service, which is responsible for pursuing
counterfeiters. The agents met the officers at the train and,
according to court documents, immediately identified the bills as
the type of counterfeit believed to originate in Bulgaria.
Documents filed in court say the agents checked the passenger
roster and identified one rider as a Bulgarian national. After
questioning by the agents, the agents were able to find the ring
members who were passing the money in New York City, court
documents indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Secret Service agents, who began an investigation of the
counterfeit $100 bill before the discovery on the train, quickly
identified the Amtrak find as part of the bills flooding in New
York City. Prosecutors said $35,000 to $40,000 worth of the bogus
bills were being passed in the New York area every week.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's office in the Southern
District of New York said that the counterfeiting ring had been
passing both old and new versions of the bills. Court papers said
the men either gave the bills to unsuspecting merchants or sold
them at a discount, typically for 40 cents on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce A. Townsend, the special agent in charge of the Secret
Service's counterfeit division, said the Bulgarian bills were of
high-quality, but that fakes of the new bills, with the off-center
portraits, were easily detectable by anyone familiar with the new
currency's security features. Townsend said that new bills have
security features that make them very difficult to copy.
</P>
<P>
   Townsend said the bills were made with an offset printing press,
which is a traditional way of making counterfeit money. Much of the
new counterfeit money detected by the Secret Service is reproduced
with computer technology, he said, although such bills tend to be
of lower quality.
</P>
<P>
   Townsend said that less than 1 percent of the more than $500
billion in U.S. currency in circulation throughout the world is
estimated to be counterfeit.
</P>
<P>
   ``A counterfeit-proof bank note does not exist,'' he said. ``But
what we do is add layers of security to make it as difficult as
possible.''

 By STEVEN HELLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tony Arefin, a self-taught graphic designer and art
director of periodicals, art catalogs and advertising who was
responsible for influential ad designs like the handwritten look of
the current IBM ``magic box'' campaign, died on May 19 at St.
Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, his wife, Amanda, said. Arefin was
38.
</P>
<P>
   Arefin successfully straddled the often polarized worlds of
magazines and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an art director who thought like an editor,'' said Chee
Pearlman, former editor of ID magazine, who hired Arefin as
creative director in 1993. ``He could write smart headlines as well
as reduce complex subjects into clear visual forms.''
</P>
<P>
   Abed Arefin was born in Karachi, Pakistan. He was later
nicknamed Tony by his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Arefin moved with his family to Bangladesh, and in 1974 during
political strife there, moved to London. He left school early and
worked at various unskilled jobs that motivated him to improve.
</P>
<P>
   By chance, while working on a movie, Arefin was offered a job as
a curator at the Photography Gallery in London, where he organized
a retrospective exhibition of the popular magazine The Face,
designed by Neville Brody. Arefin credited Brody, whom he also
hired to design art catalogs, with indirectly helping Arefin
realize that he should pursue graphic design as a career.
</P>
<P>
   Arefin started designing his own art catalogs. He proved to have
a talent for typography and became so prolific that the design
critic Rick Poynor wrote in the British magazine Blueprint that
Arefin was ``single-handedly processing the print needs of the
entire British art scene.''
</P>
<P>
   ID magazine sent Arefin to New York. His work in New York drew
on everything that interested him, from polished professionalism to
street art.
</P>
<P>
   While he worked on ID he was also art director of Bomb, an arts
magazine, and Blind Spot, an art photography quarterly. He found
magazines too limited in terms of audience and earnings, however.
Leaving his wife and their two young sons in New York, he accepted
an offer from the advertising agency Wieden &AMP; Kennedy in Portland,
Ore., to become an art director for the Microsoft brand.
</P>
<P>
   Arefin also created a striking print campaign for Nike,
introducing its ``I can'' theme.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a good working relationship at Wieden, Arefin returned
to New York after two years.
</P>
<P>
   Arefin joined Ogilvy &AMP; Mather as associate creative director and
senior partner, and worked most recently on the IBM ``magic box''
campaign. By using handwritten lettering scrawled over monumental
photographs of the ``box,'' which is a computer network server, he
gave the product a human aura.
</P>
<P>
   He also worked as a creative director on the Lotus Notes ``I Am
Superman'' campaign, which pulled individuals out of crowds to
indicate the personal nature of the product.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Arefin is survived by two sons, Rafi,
11, and Sami, 9, of New York; his parents, Shamsul and Abeda, and a
sister, Ayesha, all of London.

LOS ANGELES BRACING FOR CONVENTION PROTESTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To the consternation of city officials and
convention planners, the sea turtles are preparing to beach.
</P>
<P>
   The costumed demonstrators, along with thousands of plainclothes
protesters, are expected to descend on Los Angeles for the
Democratic National Convention in August. Emboldened by the
so-called Battle in Seattle during last year's World Trade
Organization meeting, and this year's attention-grabbing tactics in
Washington, they intend to march, shout and tie up traffic to make
their points about economic disparity, environmental insanity and a
variety of other concerns, from gay rights to the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters even have their own shorthand for the convergence
of Democrats, the millennium and LA: D2KLA.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows quite what to expect. All sides say they want peace
to prevail. But with newly energized protesters willing to square
off against a Los Angeles Police Department whose integrity is
under attack, there is also growing fear that the confrontations
could turn ugly. To further complicate matters, the homeless have
plans to stage a rival convention for 1,000 of their own
``delegates'' just blocks from the main event at the sports and
concert arena known as Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Fithian, a key organizer of the protests for Direct Action
Network, said, ``We will be there and we will be heard. The powers
that be want to marginalize us, and we're not going to let that
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In a city where image is everything, this is hardly the image
Los Angeles had in mind when it bid to bring the Democratic
convention here. After riots, earthquakes and O.J. Simpson, the aim
was to showcase Los Angeles as a world-class city, one ready for
the new millennium rather than one just on the rebound. The
convention promised the sort of positive attention seldom seen
since the 1984 Olympics, which the city hosted to great success.
</P>
<P>
   Many still believe the convention will do just that. But the
gathering also comes at an awkward time for Los Angeles, now
embroiled in its most far-reaching police corruption scandal in
recent history. The smallest misstep by authorities is likely to
make the nightly news. A debacle like the one in Seattle, where
police fired tear gas and rubber bullets into crowds, would
probably overwhelm coverage from the convention floor and crowd out
good-news stories about the city beyond the convention center's
doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually a good time for L.A.,'' said Michael Dear,
director of the Southern California Studies Center at the
University of Southern California. ``The more exposure it gets as a
serious metropolitan city, the better, because it's been too easy
for too long for people to look at L.A. as a flaky exception to all
things American. That image is obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to be (the 1968 Democratic
convention) in Chicago all over again,'' he added. ``Could it get
hair-raising and dangerous? That's open to question. But given, as
it were, that the whole world will be watching, the LAPD has to be
on its best behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   But police professionalism could be pushed to the limits by the
broad array of protesters expected. Fithian, whose organization is
helping coordinate the activities of more than 150 protest groups,
said she expects relatively few of them to spend time in what has
been dubbed ``the protest pit'' _ an area near Staples Center that
will be set aside for demonstrators who apply for permits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be an orderly, vocal, noisy week,'' said James
Lafferty, executive director of the Los Angeles office of the
National Lawyers Guild, which is recruiting scores of legal
observers to witness the demonstrations and and dozens of lawyers
to represent those arrested. ``Civil disobedience can be done
peacefully if the police don't treat it as a military invasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Colin Rajah, director of programs at the Oakland-based
Youth Action for Globe Justice Network, which plans to send dozens
of young protesters to the area, ``It's been a long time coming,
this attention to reforming the social and economic system, and we
want to take advantage of the momentum. But the idea is to get
attention for the issues, not to have a direct confrontation with
police.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling disruptions during meetings of the World Trade
Organization in Seattle and the World Bank in Washington, law
enforcement officials say they are preparing for any and all
scenarios. The Los Angeles Police Department has canceled all
vacations for both officers and civilian personnel. The sheriff's
department will provide backup in the event of mass arrests.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal agencies have mobilized too, devising plans to
cope with everything from unruly protests to urban terrorism. Few
expect the worst, but everyone wants to be ready for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping the designated public demonstration area will
work,'' said Lieutenant Horace Frank, a spokesman for the LAPD.
``We want to allow voices to be heard, but in peaceful areas. .
.It's disconcerting to hear otherwise. We have a responsibility to
ensure the community is not disrupted and, if it is, we will have
to respond in kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Austin, a spokesman for the LA Convention 2000 host
committee, called the protest area ``a phenomenal piece of real
estate,'' near enough the convention center for delegates to take
notice and to give journalists easy access. ``The location,'' he
said, ``says a lot about our attitude toward the protesters. We
want them out front. We don't want them in Siberia.''
</P>
<P>
   The LA convention has faced a host of other obstacles, including
fund-raising and management snags. But, with Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan more personally involved, convention planners say
they expect the week to go smoothly. One reason: many of the major
groups involved in the previous protests, among them the AFL-CIO,
have endorsed Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee. Other
protest groups, such as Friends of the Earth, have not yet endorsed
a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, other groups such as the Action Resource Center in Venice
have made a point of dogging Gore, hoping to get him to
disassociate himself from certain companies whose policies they
oppose or to change his stand on specific issues. The week of Aug.
14 is another chance to capture the attention of Gore, as well as
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, protest organizers insist they will not incite,
encourage, or condone violence. Instead, they say they fear that,
by taking to the streets, they will become targets themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you take action and you participate in nonviolent
confrontation, you are putting yourself at risk,'' said John
Sellers, a spokesman for the San Francisco-based Ruckus Society.
``The questions are: How far do we go? How far do they go? If you
expose the loss of democracy and the increase in corporate power,
it's likely that you will elicit a violent response from the
system.''
</P>
<P>
   In mid-July, the Ruckus Society will hold a training camp for
125 or so nonviolent convention protesters in Malibu, where they
will learn everything from how to unfurl political banners from
great heights to how to chain themselves together to avoid being
dispersed. A smaller training session is planned for Philadelphia,
where protesters also expect to be out in force for the Republican
National Convention, which begins July 31.
</P>
<P>
   In the city itself, the Los Angeles National Homeless Convention
is preparing for the arrival of 1,000 delegates from around the
country, among them homeless people, political activists and others
upset by the issues that exacerbate homelessness. Los Angeles has
one of the largest homeless populations in the country, and the
counter-convention is intended to focus attention on a group that
city officials everywhere often try to downplay during local
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as homeless people are drawing a line in the sand on
homelessness,'' said Ted Hayes, a local activist who had the idea
for the convention and who predicted as many as 10,000 local
homeless will participate. ``We're saying, `You come to L.A. and
we'll lead the way. . .' We come in decency and peace, and we hope
everyone will respect that.''

MY CLASSMATE, THE CANDIDATE FOR THE U.S. SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 28)  
 By BOB MORRIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I haven't seen Rick Lazio this much since high school. Back
then, he and I were in classes together in boring West Islip, N.Y.
He was barely memorable, not a star athlete, scholar, artist,
actor, surfer or class clown. He was simply decent in a way that
makes you not want to give someone the time of day as a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, since he announced his race for the Senate in
the West Islip High School gym last Sunday (``I'm no celebrity,''
he declared), the entire country knows who he is. I'm not the only
former classmate reminiscing about the lackluster impression he
made back then.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to listen to my parents sing the praises of Rick
Lazio one more time, I'll vomit,'' said Judi Ford, a classmate and
single mother from Westchester. ``My mother tells me, `Listen,
Smarty Pants, when you're important enough to be on national TV,
we'll ask for your opinion.' It drives me crazy because he was so
unremarkable, and it makes me regret wasted opportunities in my own
life.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to know what to say to that. After all, where do
brains and talent get you without ambition? If Hollywood is high
school with money, isn't Washington just high school for
opportunists? Besides, since I've always seen West Islip as a
fishpond of banality, maybe it's apt that Lazio has become its
poster boy.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the former classmates I called last week, some of them
Lazio's old buddies, recalled him as amiable, good at remembering
names and not much more. Of course, it's not unusual to feel
jealous or left behind when old faces achieve prominence and move
into a social stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea who he is,'' said Barbara Fasano, an
award-winning cabaret singer and classmate still striving for fame
in Manhattan. ``But then again, he looks just like the kind of guy
I would ignore in high school anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible to be a nobody and a somebody simultaneously? Is
it even fair to recall as a nobody a somebody who has made a name
for himself in Congress? If Rick Lazio, who now has the attention
of everyone from David Letterman to my Aunt Phyllis in Alabama (she
called to crow about how articulate he was on television), is ``no
celebrity,'' what does that make the rest of us squawking
onlookers?
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Lazio was working the Staten Island Ferry Terminal's
morning rush hour. I went to see him. ``Say hello to your next
senator,'' one of many tough-looking men in suits around him yelled
at me and the commuters passing through turnstiles. A very high
school-like alarm bell rang for each departing ferry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi Rick, remember me?'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure I do, Bob,'' he said as he shook my hand.
</P>
<P>
   I did not say, ``Well that's good because I barely remember
you.''
</P>
<P>
   But, after talking briefly about friends and teachers, I stepped
back and watched him work the crowd, tucking his lean frame in to
listen, touch arms, grip shoulders and pose with children of color
for hovering photographers.
</P>
<P>
   ``West Islip was a fairly monolithic community without much
ethnic diversity,'' he told me when I asked if his years in our
all-white, mostly Roman Catholic high school had prepared him for
politics. ``But college at Vassar and law school and my career has
made me more empathetic. I'm learning all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, he probably meant homogenous, not monolithic. Still he
seemed to be trying hard, as I know he's done as a representative.
A friend had told me that although Lazio wasn't a top honors
student in our class, he showed a cheerful press-ahead quality, and
I could see it now, as he worked wave after wave of rushing
commuters. Surely, there are easier ways to make a living and a
mark on the world.
</P>
<P>
   There were so many people around him that it was hard to have a
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were you this popular in high school?'' I asked. An absurd
question. He laughed, and that's when I realized how little high
school matters now, how we have to let go of it and adjust to what
we've become and allow others their due.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the pulpit of Riverside Church Friday morning,
speaker after speaker gave witness to the short, productive life of
Malik Sealy.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Lisa, said she lost a soulmate when he was killed in
an automobile accident last Saturday. Sealy's older brother
Dessalines talked about Malik's wry humor and comical ways. Lou
Carnesecca described Sealy as a responsible, loyal star, always
focused on the big picture.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Mitchell, who played with Sealy with the Indiana Pacers
beginning in 1989, when Sealy was a rookie, and who was a teammate
with the Timberwolves the past two seasons, described him as the
thread that brought Minnesota together this season. ``He preached
closeness,'' Mitchell said. ``He said that if we put all the
jealousy, all the contract business on the side, we could win.''
</P>
<P>
   Malik Sealy was a product of the multilayered culture of New
York City basketball, and Friday was a celebration of a basketball
life. All boroughs, several generations, all levels of his
basketball life converged on Riverside Church. Sealy was a perfect
synthesis of the New York City basketball underground, the
playground leagues and the legitimate theater of professional
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Generations of St. John's players and New York players _ some
known, some mostly unknown warriors of the paint _ came to pay
tribute: Billy Singleton, Shawnelle Scott, Greg ``Boo'' Harvey,
whom knowledgeable folks hadn't seen or heard from in years.
</P>
<P>
   The New York city legends Tiny Archibald, Kenny Smith, Rod
Strickland and Kenny Anderson huddled in one area of the church
while the current and former NBA players Ray Allen, Joe Smith,
Cedric Ceballos and Terry Dehere and probably many more familiar
faces circulated through the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The entire Timberwolves team came for the service. Mitchell
spoke, Kevin Garnett was a pallbearer. During a smaller ceremony a
day earlier, Garnett wept as he spoke about Sealy. In a league in
which rich young stars aren't often inclined to listen, the
24-year-old Garnett looked up to the 30-year-old Sealy. As an
eighth-grader in Chicago, shy and lacking confidence, Garnett
watched St. John's play and recognized himself in Sealy: same body
type, same way of moving.
</P>
<P>
   When Sealy wound up with Minnesota in 1998, he became Garnett's
mentor, teaching him lessons of how to move in the interstices of
fame, how to enjoy notoriety without being devoured by it. Now in
death Sealy was teaching his young friend to absorb the lesson of
his life despite the tragic circumstances of his death.
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday's service in the south hall of Riverside Church,
Garnett shook his head and said: ``This is real life. Real life.''
</P>
<P>
   Five Indiana Pacers flew in Thursday night to make Friday
morning's service: Mark Jackson, Chris Mullin, Dale Davis, Reggie
Miller and Al Harrington. What an odd juxtaposition of basketball
reality and respect. The Pacers were holding a 2-0 lead over the
Knicks, but the Pacers, for all the talk about ``hicks'' was more
New York than the Knicks. Mullin is from Brooklyn, Jackson is from
Queens, Harrington is from Roselle, N.J.; Miller's second home is
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Missing amid all this contemporary New York basketball history,
were the Knicks. The team arrived from Indianapolis at 3 a.m.
Friday. With a 10 a.m. service and 2 p.m. practice, the team
couldn't make it work. Charles Oakley, the former Knick who plays
with Toronto, was the closest the Knicks came to having a presence.
</P>
<P>
   Sealy's family, with the help of the NBA, put together a video
of his life: a collage of baby pictures; footage from Tolentine
High, slam-dunking days at St. John's, then fast-forwarded to draft
day with David Stern announcing that Sealy was headed to Indiana.
Fast-forward again to Sealy's successes with Minnesota this season,
replete with dunks and game-winning shots. The audience at
Riverside applauded and cheered and for a time we were all back in
that moment when Sealy was alive. Finally there was the wedding day
footage, just a few months ago, of Lisa and Malik Sealy, with their
son Malik Jr. The final shot showed Sealy in a dressing room.
Confident and assured, he said: ``I'm a Renaissance man. Artist, a
designer an athlete. There is nothing I can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   The large screen was rolled away, and we were confronted more
powerfully than before by the hollow echo of real life; the
finality of Malik Sealy's death at age 30.
</P>
<P>
   As mourners filed out of the church, a few went over to where
Miller was standing with Jackson. For all the sadness of Sealy's
death, the fact that Game 3 was being played in New York Saturday
was never far from the surface. This is the hard-edged New York
basketball tradition that produced Sealy. The game must go on.
</P>
<P>
   Fans lightly kidded Miller with respect and even warmth: things
like ``I'm a Knicks fan, but I respect your game.'' And ``Reggie,
you play hard, man, I got to give it to you. I still like the
Knicks.'' Miller, wearing sunglasses, nodded politely but said
nothing. He hugged a close friend and spoke quietly. But this was
not his day; he came, like all the others, to pay final respects to
a friend.

 &HT;    Reputation of witness may be a boon for prosecution
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin and Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Chester Anderson is a schemer, a liar, a convict and a
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   He also might be the best thing the prosecution's got going so
far in its case against NFL star Ray Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old con man Friday became the state's first witness
to testify that the All-Pro linebacker was an active participant in
the Buckhead melee that left two men stabbed to death Jan. 31 hours
after the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he saw Lewis standing over and kicking a lifeless
victim who lay face down on the road. Prosecutors will say this was
5-foot-3 Jacinth Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him kicking the smaller gentleman,'' said Anderson,
currently in jail on identity fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   While Anderson's credibility was called into question during a
lengthy cross-examination by Lewis' lawyer, Ed Garland, Fulton
County District Attorney Paul Howard sought to buttress it with
corroborating witnesses. And Howard said he will call on more
witnesses next week to substantiate Anderson's account.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's testimony finished a day when prosecutors considered
whether to grant immunity to Carlos Stafford, a Houston man who was
in Lewis' stretch Lincoln Navigator limousine the night of the
killings. Lawyers for defendants Lewis, Joseph Sweeting, 34, and
Reginald Oakley, 31, contend Stafford was an active participant in
the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford's lawyer, Dwight Thomas, said any such notion is not
true. Thomas said Friday that prosecutors had told him they needed
Stafford's testimony but had not yet made the deal. If his client
testifies, the lawyer said, he will be ``helpful to some defendants
and damaging to others.'' He declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Keiva Walls, a woman who rode in the limo, also testified
Friday, saying she heard Lewis in his hotel room after the killings
saying, ``I'm not trying to end my career like this.''
</P>
<P>
   She said after leaving the hotel, Stafford went to a Dumpster
behind a fast food restaurant and threw away a large bag containing
some items. Prosecutors are contending that the items thrown away
were the suit Lewis was wearing that night.
</P>
<P>
   After Walls, Cab driver Patrick Ozonu testified that he drove
upon the crime scene and saw a man with an athletic build standing
over one of the victims and pointing angrily.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a body I could envy . . . built like a V,'' Ozonu said.
But when asked by Garland if the man could have been Lewis, Ozonu
said no, that the man was smaller than the linebacker. Ozonu also
said he saw six men attacking the victims and then run away _ but
in the opposite direction of Lewis' limousine.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution saved Anderson for the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson came to Atlanta Super Bowl week impersonating himself
as ``long-time friend'' Byron ``Bam'' Morris, a former NFL football
player convicted of drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   On Super Bowl night, Anderson testified, he saw Lewis as he
walked to the Cobalt Lounge. Anderson testified that he and two
acquaintances, whom he identified as ``Frank Bruno'' and ``John
Giovani,'' walked over to another club nearby. Prosecutors later
said these two men were actually brothers Bruno and John DiSiena.
</P>
<P>
   When they left that bar, Anderson testified, the three men
walked toward the DiSienas' rental car parked near the intersection
where Richard Lollar, 24, and Baker, 21, were stabbed to death.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he heard John DiSiena say, ``Ray Lewis and them
are kicking someone's ass.'' Anderson said he looked up and saw it
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see him fight back?'' Assistant District Attorney
Clint Rucker asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Anderson replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did he appear to be moving?'' Rucker asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' Anderson answered.
</P>
<P>
   Rucker brought up Anderson's past convictions of fraud, theft
and passing bad checks, and the witness admitted to them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that have anything to do with what you saw?'' Rucker
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, sir,'' Anderson answered, Anderson said he has no deal
from the prosecution for his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno DiSiena, a Cleveland restaurant owner, was called to
support Anderson's testimony. He said when the trio got to the
rental car, Anderson said he saw Lewis kicking a victim.
</P>
<P>
   But Bruno DiSiena said he never saw Lewis fighting, nor did he
hear his brother say he saw Lewis kicking anyone. John DiSiena, who
could have cemented Anderson's testimony, was not called to the
stand and will not be a prosecution witness, Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   Holding a thick stack of certified court records, Garland then
began his cross-examination, questioning Anderson about his past
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson admitted to obtaining the social security number of an
Arlington, Texas, man named Chad Anderson. He said he ran up
hundreds of dollars in cell phone bills, rented an apartment and
purchased five cars under Chad Anderson's name. One car, a 1999 GMC
Yukon Denali, he said, ``ran like a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point during his cross-examination, Garland paused gave
jurors a moment out of Perry Mason, bellowing, ``Stand up, Mr.
Anderson.'' The real Chad Anderson, wearing a brown blazer and
sitting behind the defense table, arose to muffled gasps throughout
the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   During a courtroom break, Chad Anderson said his appearance gave
him ``peace of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson conceded his admissions likely will lead to his
convictions on the identity fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're very successful as a fraud, aren't you?'' Garland
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fraud, yes.'' Anderson replied. But he added that he was not
lying as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Garland then accused Anderson of accusing Lewis so he could
either gain his freedom from prison or make money.
</P>
<P>
   Walking back to the defense table, Garland had one final
question, ``Would you know the truth if it bumped into you?''
</P>
<P>
   As Garland knew he would, Rucker sprang out of his chair and
shouted, ``Objection!'' amid courtroom chuckles. Bonner sustained
the objection, but Garland's point already had been made.

far in its case against NFL star Ray Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old con man Friday became the state's first witness
to testify that the All-Pro linebacker was an active participant in
the Buckhead melee that left two men stabbed to death Jan. 31 hours
after the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he saw Lewis standing over and kicking a lifeless
victim who lay face down on the road. Prosecutors will say this was
5-foot-3 Jacinth Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him kicking the smaller gentleman,'' said Anderson,
currently in jail on identity fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   While Anderson's credibility was called into question during a
lengthy cross-examination by Lewis' lawyer, Ed Garland, Fulton
County District Attorney Paul Howard sought to buttress it with
corroborating witnesses. And Howard said he will call on more
witnesses next week to substantiate Anderson's account.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's testimony finished a day when prosecutors considered
whether to grant immunity to Carlos Stafford, a Houston man who was
in Lewis' stretch Lincoln Navigator limousine the night of the
killings. Lawyers for defendants Lewis, Joseph Sweeting, 34, and
Reginald Oakley, 31, contend Stafford was an active participant in
the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford's lawyer, Dwight Thomas, said any such notion is not
true. Thomas said Friday that prosecutors had told him they needed
Stafford's testimony but had not yet made the deal. If his client
testifies, the lawyer said, he will be ``helpful to some defendants
and damaging to others.'' He declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Keiva Walls, a woman who rode in the limo, also testified
Friday, saying she heard Lewis in his hotel room after the killings
saying, ``I'm not trying to end my career like this.''
</P>
<P>
   She said after leaving the hotel, Stafford went to a Dumpster
behind a fast food restaurant and threw away a large bag containing
some items. Prosecutors are contending that the items thrown away
were the suit Lewis was wearing that night.
</P>
<P>
   After Walls, Cab driver Patrick Ozonu testified that he drove
upon the crime scene and saw a man with an athletic build standing
over one of the victims and pointing angrily.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a body I could envy . . . built like a V,'' Ozonu said.
But when asked by Garland if the man could have been Lewis, Ozonu
said no, that the man was smaller than the linebacker. Ozonu also
said he saw six men attacking the victims and then run away _ but
in the opposite direction of Lewis' limousine.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution saved Anderson for the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson came to Atlanta Super Bowl week impersonating himself
as ``long-time friend'' Byron ``Bam'' Morris, a former NFL football
player convicted of drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   On Super Bowl night, Anderson testified, he saw Lewis as he
walked to the Cobalt Lounge. Anderson testified that he and two
acquaintances, whom he identified as ``Frank Bruno'' and ``John
Giovani,'' walked over to another club nearby. Prosecutors later
said these two men were actually brothers Bruno and John DiSiena.
</P>
<P>
   When they left that bar, Anderson testified, the three men
walked toward the DiSienas' rental car parked near the intersection
where Richard Lollar, 24, and Baker, 21, were stabbed to death.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he heard John DiSiena say, ``Ray Lewis and them
are kicking someone's ass.'' Anderson said he looked up and saw it
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see him fight back?'' Assistant District Attorney
Clint Rucker asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Anderson replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did he appear to be moving?'' Rucker asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' Anderson answered.
</P>
<P>
   Rucker brought up Anderson's past convictions of fraud, theft
and passing bad checks, and the witness admitted to them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that have anything to do with what you saw?'' Rucker
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, sir,'' Anderson answered, Anderson said he has no deal
from the prosecution for his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno DiSiena, a Cleveland restaurant owner, was called to
support Anderson's testimony. He said when the trio got to the
rental car, Anderson said he saw Lewis kicking a victim.
</P>
<P>
   But Bruno DiSiena said he never saw Lewis fighting, nor did he
hear his brother say he saw Lewis kicking anyone. John DiSiena, who
could have cemented Anderson's testimony, was not called to the
stand and will not be a prosecution witness, Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   Holding a thick stack of certified court records, Garland then
began his cross-examination, questioning Anderson about his past
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson admitted to obtaining the social security number of an
Arlington, Texas, man named Chad Anderson. He said he ran up
hundreds of dollars in cell phone bills, rented an apartment and
purchased five cars under Chad Anderson's name. One car, a 1999 GMC
Yukon Denali, he said, ``ran like a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point during his cross-examination, Garland paused gave
jurors a moment out of Perry Mason, bellowing, ``Stand up, Mr.
Anderson.'' The real Chad Anderson, wearing a brown blazer and
sitting behind the defense table, arose to muffled gasps throughout
the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   During a courtroom break, Chad Anderson said his appearance gave
him ``peace of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson conceded his admissions likely will lead to his
convictions on the identity fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're very successful as a fraud, aren't you?'' Garland
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fraud, yes.'' Anderson replied. But he added that he was not
lying as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Garland then accused Anderson of accusing Lewis so he could
either gain his freedom from prison or make money.
</P>
<P>
   Walking back to the defense table, Garland had one final
question, ``Would you know the truth if it bumped into you?''
</P>
<P>
   As Garland knew he would, Rucker sprang out of his chair and
shouted, ``Objection!'' amid courtroom chuckles. Bonner sustained
the objection, but Garland's point already had been made.

   NEW WAVE OF GROWTH IN ASIA IS REMINISCENT OF 1980S
</P>
<P>
   Less than three years after a plunge in the value of Thailand's
currency set in motion a devastating economic crisis across much of
Asia, the region is riding a wave of growth reminiscent of the
Asian miracle of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The latest evidence of the resurgence came with a report that
Hong Kong's economic output rose 14.3 percent in the first three
months of the year. It was the territory's fastest quarter of
growth since 1987, and seemed to make the Asian crisis a distant
memory.
</P>
<P>
   DEMAND FOR BIG-TICKET GOODS FALLS
</P>
<P>
   Demand for big-ticket goods in April registered its steepest
decline since late 1991, and consumer spending rose at its slowest
pace in nine months, the government said, indicating that the
economy may be slowing. Durable-goods orders fell 6.4 percent;
economists had been expecting a 0.5 percent drop. Consumer spending
rose 0.4 percent, while consumer income climbed 0.7 percent; both
figures matched forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   CAR-INSURANCE PREMIUMS EDGE UP
</P>
<P>
   After falling for two years, car-insurance premiums around the
United States are climbing once again, resuming a steady
quarter-century rise. Several big insurers have begun imposing
higher prices, and analysts say that by the end of the year most
other big insurers are likely to follow. The insurers said they
were forced to act because of rising expenses for repairs and
treatment of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   PUSH FOR PRESCRIPTION-DRUG COVERAGE
</P>
<P>
   Bill Thomas of California, an influential Republican member of
the House, and Ron Wyden of Oregon, a Democratic senator, announced
that they would collaborate on a bipartisan effort to add
prescription-drug benefits to Medicare this year. The effort alters
the politics of the issue in this election year, at least
marginally increasing the chances that Congress can break the
deadlock on Medicare coverage of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   DE BEERS SEIZES ANGOLAN DIAMONDS
</P>
<P>
   De Beers has begun seizing shipments of Angolan government
diamonds after the Angolans scrapped a 10-year-old agreement with
De Beers to market stones from an Angolan concession. De Beers
officials said they were acting in part because of a $50 million
debt owed to the company by Angola.
</P>
<P>
   BOEING'S SATELLITE DEAL IS DELAYED
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's proposed purchase of the satellite unit of Hughes

<P>
   TOSHIBA FACES COMPLAINTS IN CHINA
</P>
<P>
   Toshiba's settlement of a class-action lawsuit in the United
States last year has backfired in China, where consumers are

not offered them the same deal. Masaichi Koga, a vice president of
Toshiba, went to Beijing this week to try to repair the damage.

E-COMMERCE HAS ARRIVED IN RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A new catch-phrase has become all the rage in Moscow's
business community: tochka-ru _ that's Russian for dot-com.
</P>
<P>
   As the Nasdaq Composite index has plunged and dot-com mania has
cooled in the United States, e-commerce has come to Russia,
bringing with it promises of efficiency and hopes for big profits.
</P>
<P>
   At a five-star hotel near the Kremlin on Thursday, the publisher
who brought Playboy and Cosmopolitan to the Russian market
announced the launch of Moscow's latest online business venture _
an Internet portal called eStart.ru, modeled on the popular
US-based Yahoo Web site.
</P>
<P>
   With their site displayed on a giant screen, co-editors
Konstantin Chernazatonsky and Matt Bivens gave 100 or so assembled
guests a virtual tour of what eStart will offer to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope you will find everything you need here. How to plant a
tree. How to make cappuccino at home. What you can eat when you are
pregnant. What's on television,'' said Bivens, a US citizen who
also is editor of Russia's main English-language newspaper, The
Moscow Times.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers free e-mail, a search engine, news, sports,
health and lifestyle features, and chat rooms. Most of the content
is produced by eStart's majority owner, Independent Media, a Dutch
company that publishes 14 glossy magazines _ including the Russian
versions of Playboy, Cosmopolitan, Harper's Bazaar, and Good
Housekeeping _ and four newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Derk Sauer, Independent Media's CEO, said the company plans to
invest $5 million in eStart, and hopes to turn a profit after three
years.
</P>
<P>
   All this may seem old hat to Internet-savvy Americans, but
ventures like eStart are relatively new here. And although it is
much too early to talk about a ``new economy'' in Russia, an
e-commerce craze visibly has caught on in this vast nation's
capital city.
</P>
<P>
   Billboards plugging online supermarkets adorn Moscow streets.
Television ads for Ozone.ru, an online bookstore aspiring to be
Russia's answer to Amazon.com, appear in prime time on most
channels. One of the country's hottest Web sites is Molotok.ru, an
Internet-based auction house that is Russia's version of eBay.com.
Web designers suddenly are demanding salaries from $500 to $1,000 a
month in a country where the average monthly wage is $70.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts expect Internet advertising revenues, just
$1.5 million last year, to increase to $45 million by 2005. With so
much cash at stake, eStart and several other companies are vying to
become Russia's Yahoo _ the site where Internet users start off on
when they surf the Web.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a US-based investment fund paid $2.5 million for an
undisclosed stake in a web portal called Port.ru. In January, a
group of Russian and foreign investors announced plans to put as
much as $30 million into Russia's most popular search engine,
Rambler.ru, in hopes of making it Russia's premiere site.
</P>
<P>
   Online retail shops also have mushroomed.
</P>
<P>
   This is a potentially huge growth market, mainly because going
to the store here _ where surly clerks, inconsistent inventories
and long lines are the norm _ can be a nerve-wracking ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular virtual department store, called xxl.ru, boasts
more than 7,000 products ranging from bed linens to groceries to
office supplies to concert tickets, and offers free same-day
delivery for orders over $17.
</P>
<P>
   ``No more bad weather and heavy bags. No more traffic jams and
long lines,'' the site's advertisement reads.
</P>
<P>
   With a staff of 187 full-time employees, xxl.ru takes an average
of 100 orders a day. Kirill Modylevsky, the company's commercial
director, expects that number to increase dramatically in the next
several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, five years from now people won't buy things in
stores at all,'' Modylevsky said. ``This is a waste of time. Why
trudge down a dirty street to a store when you could be reading a
book?''
</P>
<P>
   Like most online retailers, xxl.ru has yet to make a profit, but
Modylevsky said he expects the company to break even by the first
quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the optimism, online business in Russia remains limited.
The country's 1.7 million regular Internet users _ just over 1
percent of the population _ are confined mostly to big cities such
as Moscow and St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Russian Internet generated just over $100 million
in turnover, most of which came from business-to-business
transactions. This is a far cry from the billions of dollars in
Internet sales the United States saw just over the 1999 Christmas
season.
</P>
<P>
   And financial analysts here say that no matter how slick a
Web-based retailer's Internet site may be, the industry is still
hampered by the same things that slow down Russia's traditional
economy: inadequate payment mechanisms, low disposable income among
consumers, and poor distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Few Russians have credit cards, and those who do, fearing fraud,
are reluctant to use them over the Internet. Distribution is
unreliable and the nation's postal system is notoriously slow and
inefficient. To get around these problems, Internet retailers are
creating their own courier services and accepting payment on
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are buying into the Internet in Russia are
making a bet on the future,'' said Kirill Gromov of Troika-Dialog,
a Moscow-based investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a good gamble. Internet use here is doubling every 18
months and e-commerce will grow as more and more Russians get
online.
</P>
<P>
   Is Russia on the verge of a Web-business boom?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is hysteria about e-commerce now, but a successful
business cannot be built with the snap of your fingers,'' eStart's
editor Chernazatonsky said. ``The main question is: Can you offer
people an efficient service? To do this you need to work at it day
after day.''

ALCON LABS TO ACQUIRE SUMMIT AUTONOMOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Summit Autonomous Inc., which pioneered laser eye surgery,
Friday said it had agreed to be acquired by Alcon Laboratories
Inc., a unit of Nestle SA, for $893.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which has been rumored at the American Cataract and
Refractory Surgery conference in Boston last week, pairs Summit,
the No. 2 maker of vision-correction lasers, with one of the
nation's largest manufacturers of contact-lens care solutions,
cataract surgical equipment and prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint announcement Friday, Alcon, based in Fort Worth,
Texas, said it will pay $19 for each of the 47.032 million shares
of Summit, based in Waltham, Mass. However, based on Summit's
closing stock price of $18.50, the deal is currently valued at $870
million. Friday's stock price is also $5.8125 higher than
Thursday's close _ a 45.8 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Large eye-care companies like Alcon can no longer ignore the
laser-vision correction market, which is growing a lot faster than
the cataract market,'' said Charles J. Olsziewski Paine Webber
senior vice president of research in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies, which are expected to discuss their agreement
with Wall Street analysts Tuesday, are part of an industry
consolidation, in which laser makers, surgical equipment and
pharmaceutical companies will bundle an array of products and
services for ophthalmologists
</P>
<P>
   In February, Bausch and Lomb Inc. of Rochester, N.Y., a leading
eye products company expanded into the laser vision correction
business by gaining US Food and Drug Administration approval for an
eye surgery procedure called Lasik.
</P>
<P>
   ``Summit without Alcon just does not have the power to compete
for business against Bausch and Lomb, which can practically give
away the laser to ophthalmologists and make its money on all the
other eye products it sells,'' said Irving Arons, managing director
of Spectrum Consulting, a Peabody-based company that tracks
laser-vision companies.
</P>
<P>
   Summit and long-time rival Visx Inc., the No. 1 laser maker,
control as much as 95 percent of the laser market to correct for
nearsightedness and farsightedness. Arons estimates that 1.65
million eye procedures will be conducted this year _ 76 percent
more than last year. Each of these operations costs $1,800 to
$2,200 per eye.
</P>
<P>
   Summit _ which changed its name from Summit Technology Inc. to
Summit Autonomus at last week's annual meeting _ has begun to catch
up to Visx, due largely to it $224 milion acquisition of Autonomous
Technologies Corp. of Orlando, Fla., early last year.
</P>
<P>
   That purchase, noted some analysts, saved Summit which had
relatively old technology and was saddled with a money-losing
network of company-owned laser-vision centers. It also had Lens
Expresss, a money-losing, mail-order contact lens business.
</P>
<P>
   Rober Palmisano, who joined Summit as chief executive 37 months
ago sold both the laser centers and Lens Express _ the hallmarks of
David F. Muller, the company's legendary cofounder and chief
executive _ and improved the company's satisfaction ratings with
ophthalmologists.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial Muller was successful in gaining FDA approval
for the nation's first medical laser system to correct
nearsightedness _ a 10-year effort that ushered in a new era in eye
care and pushed Summit stock to a peak of $50.75 in October 1995
</P>
<P>
   But life at the top was short, as Summit became embroiled in a
series of patent ownership disputes, shareholder and employee
lawsuits, and a Federal Trade Commission probe over fees that
Summit and Visx charged ophthalmologists. Summit's stock quickly
plunged to less than $5 a share as the FTC put pressure on both
companies to lower their per-procedure fees.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the the most controversial Summit issue was Muller's
mysterious receipt of stolen FDA documents about Visx newest laser
_ a theft that launched a FBI and subsequent congressional
investigation, which Palmisano said never went anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really a different company today,'' Palmisano said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An influential Republican member of the House and a
Democratic senator announced Friday that they would collaborate on
a bipartisan effort to add prescription drug benefits to Medicare
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The effort, by Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., and Sen. Ron Wyden,
D-Ore., alters the politics of the issue in this election year, at
least marginally increasing the chances that Congress can break the
deadlock on Medicare coverage of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a bipartisan, bicameral effort to move on
this issue before the end of this session,'' said Thomas, who has
authority over Medicare as chairman of the Ways and Means
Subcommittee on Health.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Wyden embraced many of the principles endorsed by
House Republicans as the framework for a plan to offer drug
benefits to all 39 million people on Medicare. In return, he got a
commitment from Thomas to support several Democratic goals.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Thomas agreed that drug companies should pay a fee
to the government whenever they develop profitable drugs by
exploiting the fruits of research subsidized by the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   The Thomas-Wyden collaboration is significant for several
reasons. It is one of the first serious efforts by members of
opposing parties to find common ground on Medicare drug benefits.
Until now, President Clinton and Democrats have pushed their
proposals and attacked Republican ideas as inadequate, while
Republicans have belittled the Democratic proposals.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate Democrat expressed concern about possible political
consequences of Friday's announcement, saying, ``This will blur the
lines between Republicans and Democrats on what is one of the
Democrats' best election issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and Wyden are considered experts on health policy. Each
shares the politics of his party leaders and the dominant faction
in his party.
</P>
<P>
   Wyden has a liberal voting record and has long been an advocate
for the elderly. As a young lawyer, he led the Oregon chapter of
the Gray Panthers. He was immersed in health care issues for 15
years as a member of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas has become the point man for House Republicans on health
policy, the person who explains the intricacies of Medicare to
colleagues and to the public. He is an architect of a House
Republican proposal, outlined last month, that would use private
insurance subsidized by the government to help pay drug costs for
the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   John P. Feehery, a spokesman for Speaker Dennis Hastert of
Illinois, described Friday's announcement as ``a welcome
development.'' Congressional aides said the Senate Democratic
leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, had urged Wyden to be cautious
in dealing with the Republicans. But Molly Rowley, a spokeswoman
for Daschle, said the joint effort could ``add some sense of
urgency, some traction and increase the likelihood that legislation
will be passed this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and Wyden said they would not write a bill of their own
but would work with each other to push legislation. In effect, they
have opened a channel for communication and cooperation between the
parties.
</P>
<P>
   The two lawmakers endorsed these principles:
</P>
<P>
   Coverage of prescription drugs should be guaranteed as ``an
entitlement'' to any Medicare beneficiary who wants it. (Democrats
insist on an entitlement.)
</P>
<P>
   Medicare drug benefits should be supervised by the Department of
Health and Human Services but probably not by the Health Care
Financing Administration, the much criticized agency that now runs
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The government should help pool the purchasing power of Medicare
beneficiaries so they can obtain discounts on drugs, like the
discounts negotiated by health maintenance organizations and other
big buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The government should pay most of the drug costs of people with
very high drug expenses. This subsidy would reduce premiums for
everyone, by reducing the total costs that must be covered by
premiums.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should discuss drug prices as an issue in
trade negotiations with Canada and other countries that regulate
such prices. Such discussions might find ways to reduce the
disparities, thus reducing the incentive for United States
residents to cross the border to get less costly drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, the president's health policy coordinator, said
he did not know enough about the Thomas-Wyden effort to comment.
``I don't think there are any details,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and Wyden did not say what premiums would be charged for
drug coverage. They did agree that some of the cost should be
defrayed by drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chairman Thomas, for the first time, has agreed to require
that drug companies pay a return-on-investment fee to the Medicare
trust fund when they profit from government-funded research,''
Wyden said. ``Again and again, taxpayers have put up the dollars to
fund the critical early research that brings blockbuster drugs to
the market. It's only fair that these taxpayer investments be
recognized through compensation by the company to our government.''

able to own shares in both companies created by the government's
latest proposal to split Microsoft in two. But Bill Gates couldn't.
The final revision of the government's proposed remedy in the
Microsoft antitrust suit would allow the Microsoft chairman to own
a stake in only one of the new companies. His co-founder _ Allen _
and close friend and chief executive _ Ballmer _ could invest in
either or both because of changes made in the proposal by the

LAZIO TO REMAIN HOUSE MEMBER WHILE RUNNING FOR SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rep. Rick Lazio said Friday that he would not resign
his House seat while he runs for the Senate, but would balance the
demands of the campaign trail with the final five months of his
House term.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio campaigned in New York City for the second time Friday,
greeting commuters and visiting a center for the elderly on Staten
Island while his opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, campaigned on
Long Island, Lazio's home base, and got the endorsement of a labor
federation.
</P>
<P>
   When Lazio, who seemed to have anticipated the question, was
asked at a news conference if he was considering resigning to focus
on his campaign, he replied, ``It is not something I am considering
at all.'' He had taken a break from his travels on Tuesday and
Wednesday to vote on several bills, including the measure
normalizing trade with China, which he supported.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio and Republican leaders said they did not think his
Washington duties would distract him from the race, but the issue
recalled the 1998 Senate race, when Sen. Alfonse D'Amato attacked
his challenger, Rep. Charles E. Schumer, for missing key votes
while campaigning. The tactic backfired when it was learned that
D'Amato, who lost the race, had also missed legislative votes as a
county supervisor campaigning for the Senate in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he had participated in all but perhaps one vote this
year, but he did not promise to maintain that record as the
campaign intensifies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm going to be able to keep that pace up,'' he
said. ``I think the voters in New York are smart enough to
understand that I can't make this race, with five months to go,
without meeting them, getting to know them, being held accountable
and answering your questions. That will mean that some votes will
be missed. And so I'm just going to work very hard to make sure
that the most significant votes, I'm there for.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's decision should have no effect on the contest to succeed
him as the representative from the 2nd Congressional District, in
Suffolk County. Lazio's two-year term, his fourth, is up this year.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, if Lazio resigned on or before July 1, the
governor would call a special election to fill the seat for the
remainder of the term.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Clinton would not comment on Lazio's decision
to retain his seat.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders sought to portray the decision as a sign of
diligence to duty that is relatively risk free. Some noted that the
House would be in recess for much of the summer, and with all the
House seats up this year, few expected critical votes to be
scheduled in the fall while members campaigned to keep their jobs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Obviously with what Congressman Lazio has been able to
accomplish in one week, we believe he has the momentum going into
the convention,'' said Dan Allen, a spokesman for the state
Republican committee, which is expected to officially nominate
Lazio at its convention on Tuesday. ``He's got the ability and he
is doing his job.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio got a warm reception on Staten Island, a Republican
stronghold where Clinton has campaigned only once. In contrast to
the occasional heckler he encountered while campaigning in
Manhattan on Tuesday, Lazio accepted hugs and kisses from adults
and children.
</P>
<P>
   A few Democrats said they would consider voting for Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have put Hillary in there just because she was
Hillary and she was running against Giuliani,'' said Tony McBroom,
who works in medical-book publishing and lamented Giuliani's poor
standing with black residents. ``As a race of people, we are not
too cool with Mr. Giuliani right now. So we would like to hear and
see what Lazio has got to say.'' He referred to Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, who had been expected to be the Republican Senate nominee
until he withdrew from the race for personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's latest endorsement was announced at an outdoor rally
held by the Building and Construction Trades Council of Nassau and
Suffolk Counties, a Long Island umbrella organization of 38 local
trade unions with 60,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   The council has a history of endorsing candidates from both
major political parties, but its president, Jack Kennedy, said that
in the Senate campaign, Lazio ``wasn't even in the running.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The AFL-CIO sent us his record, and his record as far as
voting on labor issues and for working people has not been good,''
Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance in Glen Cove, atop a flatbed truck decked
out with ``Hillary'' campaign signs, was her first foray onto Long
Island since Lazio replaced Giuliani as her opponent. She spent
almost an hour talking with people in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and Mayor Thomas Suozzi of Glen Cove, a Democrat,
introduced Clinton to a cheering crowd. She said she was deeply
honored to win their support. ``I look forward to forging a strong
partnership as we work together on behalf of New York's working
families,'' she said.

BUSH VOICES SUPPORT FOR VATICAN'S STATUS AT UNITED NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This story, eliminated earlier, has been restored.) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Speaking to a Roman Catholic group, Gov. George
W. Bush on Friday took the side of the Vatican in a battle over its
status at the United Nations, a clash that stems in large part from
its stands in international disputes over family planning and
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, criticized during the Republican primary campaign for
appearing at Bob Jones University, whose leaders have expressed
anti-Catholic views, brought up the effort by a number of groups,
many of them women's and health organizations that disagree with
the church on abortion and family planning, to downgrade the
Vatican's permanent-observer status.
</P>
<P>
   ``In world affairs, the Holy See has long been an influence for
the good, and never more than in the last couple of decades,'' said
Bush, speaking by satellite hookup to the Catholic Press
Association, which was meeting in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some groups have been trying to silence that voice in the
United Nations,'' he said. ``The position of the current
administration is unclear. The position of my administration will
be very clear and firm: America supports permanent-observer status
for the Holy See.''
</P>
<P>
   But aides to both Vice President Al Gore and Richard Holbrooke,
the United States' chief delegate to the United Nations, said Gore
and the Clinton administration backed the Vatican's
permanent-observer status as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is once again making foolish charges,'' said Douglas
Hattaway, a spokesman for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In his talk to the Catholic Press Association, Bush also spoke
of compassion and values, his remarks sprinkled with quotations
from both Pope John Paul II and Cardinal John O'Connor, the late
archbishop of New York. ``A truly welcoming society must be a
culture of life,'' the governor said, calling for the ``day when
every child, born and unborn, is welcome in life and protected in
law.''
</P>
<P>
   And he drew applause when he said that he supported legislation
to ban a kind of late-term abortion whose opponents refer to it as
``partial birth.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question, Bush defended Texas' record on
executions, saying that capital punishment, more common here than
in any other state, ``sends a chilling message'' that deters crime.
He said once again that he knew of no innocent person whom the
state had executed.
</P>
<P>
   As for the controversy over the Holy See, the Vatican has had
special observer status at the United Nations since the
organization's birth more than half a century ago. It cannot vote
in the General Assembly, but it takes part as a full member nation
in international conferences, where it has taken strong stands
against contraception and abortion. Groups that have called for the
Vatican to lose its special status argue that it is not a state,
but rather a religious headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides said that his comments Friday about the Clinton
administration's position on the matter had been prompted by the
U.S. mission's sponsoring of a news conference in March by
Catholics for Free Choice, a group seeking a review of the
Vatican's status. A nongovernment organization, or NGO, has to be
sponsored by a member nation in order to hold a news conference at
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ellen Glynn, a spokeswoman for Holbrooke, the chief U.S.
delegate, said the mission also granted sponsorship the next day to
another Catholic organization, which took the other side of the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policy is to sponsor legitimate NGOs if they want to use
the facilities _ nothing more, nothing less,'' Glynn said. ``It is
a nonpartisan policy.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the administration supported the Vatican's status. ``We
work very well with the Holy See on a variety of issues,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Bush who briefed reporters at the governor's campaign
headquarters here said a Bush administration would not have given
Catholics for Free Choice access to the United Nations. But this
aide spoke on the condition that he not be identified. Ari
Fleischer, spokesman for the campaign, was less definitive, saying
that if a Bush administration sponsored such a group, Bush ``would
make clear he didn't share their point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway, speaking for Gore, said of Bush and his visit to Bob
Jones University, ``If he's truly concerned about Catholics, why
did he address a place that calls Catholicism a cult?''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over Bush's campaign stop at Bob Jones, in South
Carolina, was stoked by Sen. John McCain, who was Bush's main rival
for the Republican presidential nomination. Bush later wrote to
O'Connor to say he regretted not having used his appearance at Bob
Jones to speak out against its leaders' views.

WOODS IS LEADER OF THE PACK AT THE MEMORIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ohio _ Every time Tiger Woods stood over a shot Friday
afternoon, people expected something special to happen. There was a
buzz in the air, like when a great singer steps to the microphone,
or when Mark McGwire steps in the batter's box.
</P>
<P>
   The electricity started on the front nine, when Woods made four
consecutive birdies, beginning on the fifth hole. That birdie
barrage set the tone for the day, with Woods on top of his game, in
calm conditions that were great for scoring, on a perfectly
manicured golf course that was at his mercy.
</P>
<P>
   Woods kept moving up the leader board until there was no one
left to catch. At one point during the second round of the Memorial
Tournament Friday, Woods was at 1-under, while Harrison Frazar was
already in the clubhouse at 9-under. At that point, the question
was whether Woods would catch Frazar this weekend. Instead, Woods
caught Frazar Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a brilliant 9-under 63, and closing with birdies on the
final two holes, Woods took a one-stroke lead over Frazar into
Saturday's third round. Woods was 10-under for the tournament
(134), one stroke ahead of Frazar (135), who shot a 69, and two
strokes ahead of Ernie Els, who shot a sensational 64, but who was
overshadowed by the world's No. 1 player. Olin Browne, Brad Elder,
Steve Lowery and Mike Weir were tied for fourth place at 5-under.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, Frazar and Els will be grouped in the final threesome
Saturday, with tee times moved up in an attempt to avoid the
expected rain. But Friday, it rained birdies at Muirfield Village
Golf Club, as Woods put on a show that displayed all of his
talents. There were many highlights during his round, like a chip
shot from 18 feet to save par at No. 16, and great approaches at
No. 17 and No. 18 that led to easy birdies.
</P>
<P>
   Woods closed with flair, hitting a 6-iron approach shot at No.
18 that almost ended up in the cup. It landed about 20 feet past
the hole, but it slowly sucked back toward the hole, and the
screaming from the gallery grew louder as the ball drew closer to
the cup. It finally stopped a foot away from the hole, denying
Woods an eagle finish. But he was smiling as he walked up the 18th
fairway acknowledging the crowd's cheers, and he tapped in for
birdie to end a memorable day.
</P>
<P>
   When Woods gets the kind of momentum he built Friday, birdies
come in bunches. After his round, which included nine birdies and
no bogeys, the defending Memorial champion talked about his superb
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hit a few good shots, you tend to build on your
confidence, and you tend to string them together,'' said Woods, who
is trying to successfully defend a tournament for the first time in
his career. ``I've always been one of those players that can string
shots together. Once I get it going, I tend to keep it going. Maybe
that's because of how emotional I am when play. I get fired up.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods had plenty to get fired up about, because all parts of his
game were working: his driver, irons, short game and putter. He
made a 12-foot putt for birdie at No. 5, then he hit a great wedge
shot at No. 6 to within one foot for an easy tap-in birdie. At the
par-5 No. 7, Woods' second shot went into a front bunker, but he
blasted out to 12 feet, then made another putt for birdie. Then, at
No. 8, Woods hit an 8-iron approach shot to 10 feet, and dropped
another putt for birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Woods birdied the par-3 No. 12, hitting a 9-iron tee shot within
8 feet before making the putt. At No. 13, Woods hit another 9-iron
approach shot within 12 feet, before making another putt, pointing
at the hole as the ball disappeared, as the crowd roared. That was
followed by another birdie at the par-5 No. 15, set up by a
terrific chip shot to within a foot on his third shot.
</P>
<P>
   So while Frazar is still in position for his first tour victory,
and Els is hungry for his first triumph since February of last
year, they will both have to catch Woods. And that is something
that is never easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in good shape going into the weekend,'' Woods said. ``I
don't know how many holes we are going to get in tomorrow, but it
was a good day to post a good number. We don't know how many holes
this tournament is going to be.''

BUSH SUPPORTS USE OF DNA TESTS ON CONDEMNED INMATES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JOHN MORITZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, who has presided over more
executions than any governor in modern American history, said on
Friday that he favors DNA testing on condemned inmates to ``erase
all doubts'' that an innocent person might be put to death.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who defend Death Row inmates called Bush's remark
``encouraging,'' but questioned why the governor has not pushed for
a law requiring DNA testing in the state that leads the nation in
executions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only should they be doing DNA testing for Death Row
inmates, but for all inmates where the science could prove guilt or
innocence,'' said Barry Scheck, who gained national prominence as
part of O.J. Simpson's legal defense team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology is such where we now have this magic bullet of
truth and we should be using it in every case where it would make a
difference,'' Scheck said.
</P>
<P>
   Scheck is working with Austin lawyer Maurie Levin on behalf of
Texas Death Row inmate Ricky McGinn, whose execution is scheduled
for June 1. The lawyers filed a petition on Friday with the Texas
Court of Criminal Appeals on McGinn's behalf that DNA testing be
used in his case.
</P>
<P>
   McGinn was convicted of raping and killing a 12-year-old girl in
Brown County in Central Texas. He has denied committing the crimes,
and his lawyers say DNA testing on the hair and body fluid samples
found at the crime scene are essential to settle any doubt in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   McGinn had been scheduled for execution on April 27. But Fort
Worth lawyer Richard Alley, who was handling his case at the time,
won a stay because the March 28 tornado that ravaged the city
destroyed his office _ including papers relevant to his client's
case.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the presumed Republican presidential nominee, made the DNA
remark during a teleconference from Austin with a Catholic
journalists organization meeting in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The governor did not waver from his strong support for the death
penalty, which has been carried out 217 times in Texas, 130 of
those during his 51/2-year tenure. And he reiterated his long-held
assertion that none of those sent to Huntsville's death chamber
were innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe we've executed a single innocent person,''
Bush said told The Associated Press. ``If the DNA testing helps to
settle a case, or erase any doubts or concerns, we would support
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty has become a key issue in Bush's run for the
presidency, not only because of the pace of executions in Texas.
Earlier this year, Republican Gov. George Ryan of Illinois imposed
a moratorium on execution once evidence emerged raising doubt on
the guilt of 13 inmates awaiting the death penalty in that state.
</P>
<P>
   Texas executed 35 inmates last year, the most in the nation, and
this year is ahead of that pace, with 18 so far. The state set a
record with 37 executions in 1997. Bush has spared only one
condemned inmate since becoming governor in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He has rejected appeals from U.S. religious leaders, the Vatican
and the European Parliament in several death penalty cases,
including that of Karla Faye Tucker, the Houston pickax killer who
had professed to having become a born-again Christian in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Texas law limits the governor's power in capital cases. A
governor may commute a death sentence or grant clemency only upon
the recommendation of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles.
</P>
<P>
   A governor on his own may grant a one-time, 30-day stay of
execution to allow a condemned inmate more time to pursue court
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush has been reluctant to intervene in death penalty
cases, he has issued pardons to two inmates sentenced on sexual
assault charges because DNA tests showed that the men were not
guilty.

NUN DEFIES VATICAN REQUEST FOR SILENCE ON GAY MINISTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Roman Catholic nun from Maryland, ordered last year by the
Vatican to end a ministry to gay and lesbian Catholics, said Friday
that she would not comply with a new request by Vatican authorities
that she cease speaking and writing about the case.
</P>
<P>
   The nun, Sister Jeannine Gramick, said in a prepared statement
that the Vatican and the leaders of her order had asked her ``to
silence myself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After finding my voice to tell my story, I choose not to
collaborate in my own oppression by restricting a basic human
right,'' she wrote. ``To me this is a matter of conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades, Gramick and the Rev. Robert Nugent, a
Maryland priest, had collaborated in a national ministry to gay
Catholics, until they were ordered last July to end that work by
the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vatican body
charged with safeguarding church teaching.
</P>
<P>
   In an official directive, which followed years of investigation
by church authorities in the United States and Rome, the
congregation said Gramick and Nugent had allowed ``errors and
ambiguities'' into their discussions of Catholic teaching on
homosexuality. The congregation said the two had not sufficiently
emphasized church teaching that homosexual acts were
``intrinsically disordered.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gramick and Nugent said they would comply with the
directive, they said later that they felt free to speak publicly
about the case itself.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Friday from its provincial headquarters in
Baltimore, Gramick's order, the School Sisters of Notre Dame, said
another Vatican body, the Congregation for the Institutes of
Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Faith, recently
clarified the original directive. The clarification said Gramick
and Nugent were barred from writing and speaking about
homosexuality and discussing the directive or the procedures that
led to it.
</P>
<P>
   Gramick was told of the limitations Wednesday in a meeting with
the leaders of her order in Rome, who released a statement saying
they were deeply saddened that she would not comply.
</P>
<P>
   Nugent's religious order, the Society of the Divine Savior,
released a statement, saying that he too had gone to Rome this week
and been informed of the Vatican's views on its directive. The
society said Nugent ``has respected in good faith'' the directive
issued last year.

SHUTTLE UNDOCKS FROM SPACE STATION 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Atlantis astronauts pulled away from the fledgling
international space station Friday, leaving behind a still
uninhabited but much enhanced orbital outpost ready to accept the
long overdue Russian crew module.
</P>
<P>
   The seven shuttle astronauts undocked from the two-room station
shortly after 6 p.m. CDT, as the two spacecraft soared more than
230 miles above Kazakhstan in Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   After the separation, commander Jim Halsell and pilot Scott
``Doc'' Horowitz steered Atlantis slowly around the outpost while
their crewmates snapped dozens of photographs of the exterior,
imagery that will serve as documentation for engineers on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   With a final maneuver, Atlantis sped rapidly away from the
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, for leaving the space station in better shape than
when you arrived,'' NASA's mission control told Halsell and his
crew.
</P>
<P>
   During a six-day linkup, the Atlantis crew overhauled a
faltering power system in the station's Russian segment, repaired
the American communications system and latched down a wobbly
external cargo crane installed during a previous shuttle visit. The
astronauts left behind 3,300 pounds of new equipment, along with
food, water, clothes, computers and exercise machines for future
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   Using the shuttle's steering thrusters, the astronauts raised
the station's altitude by nearly 30 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The mission prepared the station's first components for the
addition of the 43-foot-long Russian crew module, which will
furnish the station with an independent life support system,
including living quarters for three full-time inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   The crew module is scheduled for launching from Central Asia on
July 12.
</P>
<P>
   With the crew module attached, the station will be ready for its
first full-time inhabitants, American commander Bill Shepherd and
cosmonauts Sergei Krikalev and Yuri Gidzenko. The three men are
preparing to lift off in late October for a stay of several months,
during which they will direct the addition of an American research
module and other components.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's chronic economic problems, and the twin failures last
year of the country's workhorse Proton rocket, have contributed to
a more than two-year delay in the development and launching of the
crew module.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the two Proton losses was traced to the presence of
foreign debris, including a piece of cloth, trapped in rocket
engine turbo machinery fabricated in 1992. The manufacturing period
coincided with political and economic upheaval in Russia following
the breakup of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Modifications will include propulsion system filters and new
pre-launch cleaning and testing procedures to cut the risk of
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Once the crew module has been launched, the two currently
orbiting segments of the station will initiate an automated
rendezvous and linkup.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday, the shuttle astronauts spent several hours
carefully retreating from the space station, a procedure that
required them to close and seal a half-dozen large hatches as they
backed out.
</P>
<P>
   NASA scheduled light duty for the astronauts during the
remainder of their 10-day mission.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantis is scheduled to touch down at NASA's Kennedy Space
Center in Florida on Monday at 1:20 a.m. CDT.

ARCHBISHOP URGES CALIF. GOVERNOR TO HALT EXECUTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Roman Catholic archbishop of Los Angeles has
urged Gov. Gray Davis of California to halt executions and appoint
a bipartisan commission to conduct a ``comprehensive and objective
study'' of a system that he called ``fatally flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that an objective study will provide substantial
factual data to support moral and ethical questions raised by the
Catholic bishops of California and the United States regarding the
death penalty,'' stated the archbishop, Cardinal Roger Mahony, in a
letter to Davis that was made public on Thursday, after Mahony
addressed the National Press Club in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who is Catholic, has been an outspoken supporter of the
death penalty. He has drawn increasing criticism from fellow
Democrats for his tough stance on criminal justice in general,
including his refusal of any recommendation by the state parole
board in favor of early prisoner release.
</P>
<P>
   Mahony's letter noted the recent decision of Gov. George Ryan of
Illinois to impose a moratorium on executions there after 13 men
sentenced to death were exonerated by new evidence. It also noted
the New Hampshire Legislature's vote to abandon capital punishment,
though that was later vetoed.
</P>
<P>
   ``California has no less an obligation to conduct a thorough
assessment of its system in order to identify the inequities,
weaknesses and biases of the process used to try those charged with
capital crimes and administer the death penalty,'' Mahony stated in
his letter.
</P>
<P>
   California now has 565 inmates on death row, the most of any
state in the nation. In his speech, the cardinal noted that the
long-term goal was ``not simply to make the death penalty free from
bias, inequity or human error,'' but instead to open a ``public
dialogue that ultimately brings a permanent end to state
executions.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Davis in Sacramento, Hilary McLean, said the
governor ``will continue to enforce California's death penalty law
as long as it's on the books.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter Mahony said he shared the concern of protecting
society from violent criminals, but added: ``Our support for
victims and their family members is not diminished by imposing a
moratorium on the death penalty. Instead, a moratorium is
recognition that we cannot heal society as we continue to
administer a system that is fatally flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   In April 1999, Catholic bishops in the United States issued a
statement calling for Catholics to work for the end of capital
punishment. The statement came a few months after Pope John Paul
II, during his visit to St. Louis, made a dramatic appeal to Gov.
Mel Carnahan of Missouri to show mercy to Darrell J. Meese, a death
row inmate. A papal encyclical in 1995 said cases in which a
government would need to apply the death penalty were ``practically
nonexistent.''

HERNANDEZ, GALAXY CHALLENGE EARTHQUAKES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Newly acquired Mexican striker Luis Hernandez
returned from Mexico on Thursday night so he could get in a
training session with the Los Angeles Galaxy on Friday in
preparation for tonight's matchup with San Jose at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez made his Major League Soccer debut last week in a 2-1
victory over defending MLS champion D.C. United in front of 40,303
Rose Bowl fans.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez left in the 72nd minute with pain in his left
shoulder, but an MRI showed no damage. He returned to Mexico
following the game to tend to personal business.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez joined the Galaxy for a scrimmage Friday, then was
taken aside by assistant coach Ralph Perez to discuss strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Coach Sigi Schmid) would like for me to make sure what's
being said and what we want from him,'' Perez said. ``I'm
explaining the tactical side so he's in tune to what's going on. He
also needs to know where we want him on corners and restarts,
that's why it's so critical to have him here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that he has this training in, it's going to be a much
easier transition for him than it was last week.''
</P>
<P>
   After facing United, Hernandez wanted to know if the Galaxy
would have an easier time against San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him there are no easy games because we're somewhat of a
target in this league,'' said Perez. ``I also told him to be aware
of (John) Doyle and (Mauricio) Wright, two big physical defenders
for San Jose.''
</P>
<P>
   After last week's game, Hernandez doesn't need to be reminded of
how physical the MLS can be. His injured shoulder is fine, but the
pace and roughness of MLS is something that takes time to adjust
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a little more stronger and faster here than in Mexico,''
said Hernandez. ``It's more body to body. In Mexico, it's more
open, there's more liberty and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   With Hernandez's speed, however, he shouldn't have a hard time
adjusting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm already comfortable, I've done this all my life,'' said
Hernandez. ``With Argentina and Boca Juniors it was the same thing.
You just adapt to a different style of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``An understanding on the field is going to come fast. I have
the type of teammates that accommodate my style of play very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez missed the Galaxy's 2-1 loss in New England on
Wednesday, but he's arriving at a time when the Galaxy needs
scoring from their front line.
</P>
<P>
   Clint Mathis was the last Galaxy forward to get a goal, scoring
on April 15. Mathis is now with New York/New Jersey. Striker Cobi
Jones has not scored since April 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now (the forwards) need to score,'' Schmid said. ``They
need to score and that's something that's important. We've talked
about it and there will be some pressure on them to get it done.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It is an unlikely export from here, but come this fall,
a Britain-based entrepreneur will be taking his successful chain of
Internet cafes across the Atlantic to Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   The company, called EasyEverything, has created the equivalent
of cybercafes on steroids _ the one being planned for Times Square
will have 650 to 1,000 Internet terminals with high-resolution,
flat-panel screens.
</P>
<P>
   Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the founder of EasyEverything and the
5-year-old low-cost European airline, EasyJet, signed a lease this
week for a 13,300-square-foot site at 8 Times Square on 42nd Street
between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. EasyEverything is part of the
same development where the new Hilton Hotel is being completed,
along with another British export, Madame Tussaud's, the wax
museum.
</P>
<P>
   If EasyEverything has even a smidgen of the success it has had
here, queues _ er, lines _ will begin to form around the
super-cybercafe before it even opens. The first EasyEverything,
which opened June 21, 1999, near Victoria Station here with 400
computer terminals, was greeted by so many Internet surfers on its
first day that the staff handed out coffee to the hordes that
gathered offline to keep them from leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Internet cafes have never really taken off in the United States
the way they have here and throughout other parts of Europe, so it
may be somewhat of a surprise if Haji-Ioannou succeeds. Even he
concedes it may be a struggle, though one he expects to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have said that I'll never make it work in New
York,'' he said. ``But they said that about London, too. Have you
ever been to EasyEverything in London at 2 a.m.? It's packed.''
</P>
<P>
   The cafes themselves look futuristic, like a set from ``Star
Trek,'' with hundreds of people at rows of computers. They sell
coffee, snacks and sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons EasyEverything, which is open 24 hours per
day, may have succeeded in London are that most people here do not
own personal computers and that the telephone rates for dial-up
modem access to the Internet is significantly higher than in the
United States. Because local telephone calls are billed by the
minute here _ not a flat rate like American telephone companies
offer _ Internet users must pay the telephone company and the
Internet access providers, like America Online, every time they log
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``By itself, it is deadly dull for a U.S. audience,'' said Bruce
Kasrel, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, which analyzes
e-commerce. ``People already have Internet access at the office and
at home.'' He cited empty Internet access terminals at airports as
an example of a similar scheme that had not worked.
</P>
<P>
   One reason New Yorkers might log on is simply the sense of
privacy. ``I know a lot of people come in to go online to search
for jobs so their employer doesn't know,'' said Haji-Ioannou. He
also expects tourists to pop in to check their e-mail. ``Mobile
Internet access doesn't work and isn't cheap,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Haji-Ioannou has always prided himself on offering customers
things cheap. His low-cost airline EasyJet, which has many of the
qualities of Southwest Airlines, offers tickets sometimes for a
third of the cost of the same flights on British Airways. At
EasyEverything, the pricing scheme is truly laissez-faire. The
price fluctuates depending on how many people are using the
computers, but the price usually hovers around $1.50 for an hour of
surfing. ``We'll charge whatever it takes'' to fill the (cafe),''
Haji-Ioannou said.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Square cafe is set to open in September or early
October.
</P>
<P>
   Besides London, where there are now six super-cybercafes with a
total of 2,800 terminals, Haji-Ioannou also opened one in Edinburgh
last week, with others on the way in Amsterdam and Rotterdam in the
Netherlands and in Barcelona, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kasrel is not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason Regis Philbin hosts `Who Wants to be a
Millionaire' in the States,'' he said, referring to the British
program that was successfully exported. ``We have different
tastes.''

SEVENTH-GRADE BOY HELD IN KILLING OF TEACHER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JON NORDHEIMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Fla. _ A seventh-grader shot and killed a teacher on
Friday on the last day of school, after he had been sent home for
throwing water balloons in class, the police in this Palm Beach
County community said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy returned at the close of the last period of the school
year and shot the teacher, Barry Grunow, once in the head with a
small .25-caliber handgun, the authorities reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shot Mr. Grunow! He shot Mr. Grunow!'' some children cried
after the shot shattered the midafternoon buzz of children
preparing to depart for summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The body of the popular 35-year-old language arts teacher and
basketball coach at Lake Worth Middle School was found in a puddle
of blood in the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   In a scene all too commonplace on American school grounds,
wailing children were locked in classrooms by frightened teachers,
local police rushed to the school in well-rehearsed deployments to
cope with school violence, and panic-stricken parents gathered at a
school entrance to await news about their own children.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, identified as 13-year old Nathaniel Brazill,
flagged down an officer headed to the scene and surrendered minutes
after the shooting about one-quarter mile north of the school.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief William Smith said the boy was carrying a
.25-caliber Raven semiautomatic pistol with three bullets in it. A
single spent cartridge was recovered at the shooting scene.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the boy had taken the pistol a week ago from a
dresser drawer in the home of his grandfather, who owned it.
</P>
<P>
   The chief called the gun a ``typical Saturday night special.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the boy would be sent to a juvenile center for
assessment and brought before a circuit court judge for a hearing
in the morning. The Palm Beach County state attorney's office will
determine what charges will be filed and whether the boy will be
charged as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   His grandmother, Eberlena Josey, later said Nathaniel had
returned from school early and ``seemed upset,'' but gave no
indication of what his problem or plans were. Josey accompanied her
daughter, the boy's mother, to police headquarters for questioning.
She said her daughter was recovering from recent cancer surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was the best boy. the grandmother said. He was
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel earned A's and B's and had perfect attendance, said
Nat Harrington, a spokesman for the school board.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no problems of any kind, prior to this,'' Harrington
said.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Nathaniel was not in Grunow's classroom when the
balloon incident took place. He was sent home by an assistant
principal.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the boy rode his bicycle home, got the pistol
and then returned to school. He went to Grunow's class, where he
asked to see two students. Grunow stepped into the hall and would
not let him enter.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting happened quickly afterward, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not one shred of evidence,'' the chief said, ``that
he planned to do this.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Children who witnessed the shooting said the boy returned to the
school shortly after 3 p.m., as classes were about to be dismissed
for the school year.
</P>
<P>
   They said he produced a handgun as he, Grunow and another
teacher faced one another in a hall outside a classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nat, quit playing _ it's not funny anymore,'' one of the
children recalled the other teacher saying. ``Get away from me or
I'll shoot you, too,'' another pupil quoted the boy as saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest nightmare any school system could possibly
face,'' said Ben Marlin, superintendent of Palm Beach County
schools. He rebuffed reporters' questions at a late afternoon news
conference on whether stepped-up security measures would be
introduced in county schools because of Friday's shooting. ``We
already have good school security,'' said Marlin, who was attending
another school's graduation when he was notified of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anything more we can do. We do as much as we
think we can do, probably even more,'' Marlin said. ``Unfortunately
we can't control society's problems,'' he continued, pausing for a
moment before adding: ``Perhaps one thing we can do is turn off the
TV, when all we do is see violence and hear violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Legislature, in the wake of numerous shootings in
U.S. schools in recent years, recently passed legislation requiring
schools in the state to prepare ``school disaster'' response plans.
</P>
<P>
   The school system said counselors would be available this
weekend to help students and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and friends linked arms as they walked slowly, heads
bowed and sobs heaving their shoulders, into the house where Grunow
had lived with his wife, 5-year-old son and newborn baby.

BUSH VOICES SUPPORT FOR VATICAN'S STATUS AT UNITED NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Speaking to a Roman Catholic group, Gov. George
W. Bush on Friday took the side of the Vatican in a battle over its
status at the United Nations, a clash that stems in large part from
its stands in international disputes over family planning and
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, criticized during the Republican primary campaign for
appearing at Bob Jones University, whose leaders have expressed
anti-Catholic views, brought up the effort by a number of groups,
many of them women's and health organizations that disagree with
the church on abortion and family planning, to downgrade the
Vatican's permanent-observer status.
</P>
<P>
   ``In world affairs, the Holy See has long been an influence for
the good, and never more than in the last couple of decades,'' said
Bush, speaking by satellite hookup to the Catholic Press
Association, which was meeting in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some groups have been trying to silence that voice in the
United Nations,'' he said. ``The position of the current
administration is unclear. The position of my administration will
be very clear and firm: America supports permanent-observer status
for the Holy See.''
</P>
<P>
   But aides to both Vice President Al Gore and Richard Holbrooke,
the United States' chief delegate to the United Nations, said Gore
and the Clinton administration backed the Vatican's
permanent-observer status as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is once again making foolish charges,'' said Douglas
Hattaway, a spokesman for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican has had special observer status at the United
Nations since the organization's birth more than half a century
ago. It cannot vote in the General Assembly, but it takes part as a
full member nation in international conferences, where it has taken
strong stands against contraception and abortion. Groups that have
called for the Vatican to lose its special status argue that it is
not a state, but rather a religious headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over Bush's campaign stop at Bob Jones, in South
Carolina, was stoked by Sen. John McCain, who was Bush's main rival
for the Republican presidential nomination. Bush later wrote to
O'Connor to say he regretted not having used his appearance at Bob
Jones to speak out against its leaders' views.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two men with criminal histories, one of whom staged
five terrifying gunpoint robberies at fast-food outlets in New York
last year, were arrested Friday as suspects in the execution-style
shootings of seven bound-and-gagged workers at a Wendy's restaurant
in Queens, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 48 hours after the grisly massacre in Wendy's basement
walk-in refrigerator, in which five victims were slain with bullets
to the head and two were shot in the head and left for dead, police
seized John B. Taylor, 36, outside his mother's house in Brentwood,
in Suffolk County. They said he had once worked at several
fast-food restaurants in New York City, including the Wendy's where
the massacre occurred.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, detectives in Queens said they had taken
into custody a second man, Craig Godineaux. Little was known about
him, but the authorities said he had a record of at least two
previous robberies.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what led the authorities to the
suspects, but the case against them appeared to be strong.
Detectives said Taylor and Godineaux made statements implicating
each other in the crimes. Each acknowledged that they had robbed
the Wendy's restaurant, but Taylor said that Godineaux had shot the
employees and Godineaux said that Taylor had done the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Taylor had a .380 caliber pistol _ the same
caliber as the gun used in the shootings _ in a belt pack when he
was seized. The weapon was turned over to the Police Department
laboratory for ballistics tests to determine if it was the gun used
in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   After arresting Taylor, investigators began searching his
mother's house and said they hoped to find other evidence,
including cash stolen from Wendy's and a videotape that had
apparently been taken by the assailants from the restaurant's
surveillance camera at the time of the killings. The videotape may
have caught the assailants in action.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the investigators said they had found Taylor's palm
print on a box in the blood-spattered refrigerator, and they said
he had been identified by a witness as one of two men who had
emerged from the Wendy's, on Main Street in Flushing, about 11:45
p.m. Wednesday, minutes after the killings.
</P>
<P>
   About $2,000 was taken from an office in the basement, officials
said, and the shootings _ which stunned the city and even some
law-enforcement officials with their brutality _ were apparently
carried out to eliminate witnesses to the robbery, some of whom
might have recognized one of the assailants.
</P>
<P>
   Charges were not immediately filed in the killings, and police
said it was unclear whether one or two men had fired the shots in
what appeared to be an inside job, with the assailants aware of the
Wendy's operations and layout and the manager's name, which they
invoked in a ruse to get in at closing time.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Taylor, a short, stout man, was being held Friday night on an
outstanding warrant from last year, in which he jumped bail in a
robbery case. He was said to have worked at several New York
fast-food outlets in recent years, including a McDonald's in
Manhattan that he was arrested for burglarizing in 1996, and as
recently as last fall at the Wendy's in Flushing.
</P>
<P>
   The swift arrests came as more than 100 detectives worked around
the clock in pursuit of numerous leads in a case that had drawn
expressions of shock from city officials, prosecutors, police
officials, employees of fast-food outlets and ordinary New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy's and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, in addition to announcing
rewards totaling $60,000 for information leading to the arrest and
conviction of the assailants, said that a relief fund had been
established to aid the families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people crowded the sidewalk outside the scene of the
massacre Friday as a makeshift memorial of flowers, lighted candles
and written prayers grew against the wall of the restaurant.
Passersby stopped to pray and some spoke of their sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad,'' Rinkel Bhasin, 23, said after slipping behind a
police barricade to add her bouquet of white daisies to the
memorial. She said she had often patronized the Wendy's.
</P>
<P>
   One of the two survivors, Jaquione Johnson, 18, who lives with
an aunt in Jamaica, Queens, underwent six hours of surgery Friday
for his head wound and remained in critical condition in an
intensive care unit of the New York Hospital Medical Center of
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The second survivor, Patrick Castro, 22 _ who had been shot
through both cheeks, played dead until the assailants departed,
then wriggled free of the duct tape bindings and summoned help with
a call to 911 _ was released from the same hospital late Thursday
and was under police protection.
</P>
<P>
   Five families, meantime, were making arrangements for funerals.
Those killed were Anita C. Smith, 22, of South Jamaica; Ramon
Nazario, 44, of Flushing; Jeremy Mele, 18, of Neptune, N.J.; Ali
Ibadat, 40, of Ridgewood, Queens, and Jean Dumel Auguste, 27, the
Wendy's night manager, who lived in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   While little was known of Godineaux Friday night, Taylor was
described by acquaintances as the father of two sons and a
daughter, who had lived with his children in an apartment in LeFrak
City, in Elmhurst, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very secretive guy,'' said George Gross, an
across-the-hall neighbor who said he also did Taylor's tax returns
over the past decade. ``He never opened up to anybody.'' He said
Taylor often dressed in a suit and tie, even when he worked in
fast-food outlets or as a maintenance man for a Caldor's store.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials said that in 1996 Taylor had worked as
an assistant manager at two McDonald's restaurants in Manhattan,
one at 341 Fifth Ave., and the other at 22 E. 42nd St. On June 26,
1996, the officials said, Taylor and a second man were discovered
in an attempted burglary at the Fifth Avenue place at 6 a.m., by
several employees just arriving for work.
</P>
<P>
   The two men fled, but Taylor was recognized, and police arrested
him a day later at the 42nd Street McDonald's. On July 12, he
pleaded guilty to third degree robbery. While prosecutors requested
a six-month jail term, Taylor, as a first offender, was sentenced
to five years of probation.
</P>
<P>
   Former co-workers at the Fifth Avenue restaurant said Taylor was
involved in several scams, including stealing receipts and placing
ghost workers on the payroll and taking their pay for himself.

   NEW YORK _ Chuck Knoblauch said Friday night that he would
continue to speak candidly about his throwing problems. But the
second baseman added he was not going to seek out a sports
psychologist to help address the problem unless the New York
Yankees find one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to wait for the Yankees to come to me,'' he said.
``I'm not going to look for anyone. If they're going to recommend
someone, we'll see how it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   When Yankees manager Joe Torre was asked about Knoblauch's
situation, he said: ``We'll explore it, for sure, if that's what he
wants to do. That's not all that easy. It has to be someone you're
comfortable with.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, who was removed from Friday night's starting lineup
because of a strained left forearm, wants to make sure that any
psychologist he sees would deal only with the throwing woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be someone who's just sports,'' he said. ``It's
got to be a person who can focus on that and that alone.''

JUDGE GIVES NEW YORK 2 YEARS TO ISSUE AIR POLLUTION PERMITS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In a harsh rebuke to the Pataki administration, a
state judge ruled Friday that the state had ``failed to come
anywhere close'' to complying with laws requiring that it catalog
clean air requirements and violations for hundreds of major
polluters.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Acting Justice Dan Lamont of the State Supreme Court
in Albany, found that the Department of Environmental Conservation
had dragged its feet in complying with the laws. He ordered the
department to greatly accelerate the pace of its work and complete
it within two years.
</P>
<P>
   The department and Gov. George Pataki's office said this
afternoon that they had just received word of the ruling and had no
immediate comment on it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Congress amended the Clean Air Act to require that each
state determine which sites came under the act, based on their
emissions of any one of a long list of pollutants. The states were
then to issue a Clean Air Act permit for each site, listing the
emissions rules to which it was subject. The states were also
required to keep data on compliance with the rules.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 law also allowed for ``citizen suits,'' so that anyone
could sue polluters for Clean Air Act violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many of these facilities, it has been just about
impossible to find out whether they were under any kind of air
quality requirements, and if they were, whether they were in
compliance,'' said Keri Powell, an environmental lawyer with the
New York Public Interest Research Group. ``This law was supposed to
make it easy for anyone to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   A state law for carrying out the federal requirements took
effect in December 1996 and gave the Department of Environmental
Conservation three years to issue the permits. The department has
listed more than 500 polluters; most are factories and power
plants, but they also include gasoline storage sites, waste
incinerators and even big commercial buildings, like hospitals,
that have generators or incinerators.
</P>
<P>
   By last December, when the three-year period was up, the
department had issued permits to just 21 percent of the sites, a
figure that has risen to 29 percent. When the three-year clock ran
out, the New York Public Interest Research Group sued the state to
force compliance with the law.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, the state environmental agency argued that the
three-year limit was not an absolute requirement and that it was
free to use its resources in better ways.
</P>
<P>
   Lamont strongly disagreed. The department, he wrote, ``has
failed to come anywhere close to completing the permitting schedule
established by the statute and its own regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   The state had asked the court to give it four years to issue the
remaining permits, about 400 of them. Even then, the state
maintained, it was required only to issue preliminary permits. The
judge, instead, accepted the research group's proposal for a
two-year timetable for issuing final permits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge win,'' Powell said. ``It means the law will
finally be put to work. People will finally know the status of
polluters and will have the information they need to bring citizen
suits.''

GIULIANI SEEKS AN APOLOGY FOR HECKLING 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS J. LUECK

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Friday that Hillary
Rodham Clinton and the state's Democratic leadership should
apologize for the reported harassment of a police honor guard at
the May 16 State Democratic Convention in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   In the incident, hecklers are said to have spit on the officers,
who were from the Albany Police Department, and derided them as
``members of the Giuliani Third Reich.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the Albany police should vigorously investigate
the incident, and those who instigated it should be charged with
assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``The calling of names is reprehensible, and there should be an
apology by the candidate,'' Giuliani said. ``The actual spitting
should result in an arrest. I mean, spitting is an assault.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident was reported in a May 19 editorial in the New York
Post.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's call for action was dismissed Friday by officials of
the state Democratic Committee and Albany's City Hall, a
traditional bastion of Democratic politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mayor Giuliani wants a firing squad, he isn't going to get
it,'' said John C. Nielsen, the Albany police chief. ``No apologies
are necessary'' from the state Democratic leadership, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials said the convention incident had led to an
exchange that smoothed things over, at least within their own
party. A spokeswoman for Clinton, Karen Dunn, said the first lady
had called Mayor Gerald Jennings of Albany immediately after the
New York Post editorial appeared, and had said that she was
``appalled by what was reported.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith Hope, the chairwoman of the state Democratic Committee,
wrote the same day to Nielsen, apologizing for what she called
``despicable actions'' by a small group at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday, Nielsen said that Giuliani's pique over the
incident would have little impact in Albany. ``We did ask the local
media if they had any video of what happened,'' he said, ``but we
figured if they had it, they would have used it.'' He said the
Albany police had ``no plans to take this further.''

   BUSH BYPASSES TEXAS CONVENTION
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush will skip the Texas Republican Party
convention in Houston next month. The decision, reported in
Friday's Houston Chronicle, has prompted speculation that the
decision grew out of skirmishes with conservative elements of the
party, but campaign aides insisted otherwise. ``The governor will
be campaigning in Florida and Kentucky at that time,'' said Ray
Sullivan, a campaign spokesman in Austin. ``But Laura Bush is
planning to address the convention as his representative.''
Sullivan denied that there were any lingering problems with
anti-abortion elements of the party which, during the 1996 Texas
convention, stripped Bush of a governor's traditional role as
leader of the state delegation to the national convention. ``This
decision is based solely upon the fact that time is precious on the
campaign trail,'' Sullivan said. ``Texas is solid Bush country, and
we're going to spend that time letting the rest of the country get
to know Governor Bush as well as Texans do.''

   Several American Indian groups said they have planned a series
of ads criticizing Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., who is up for
re-election, The Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported. Gorton has
long feuded with some tribes over fishing rights and various
sovereignty issues. The Indian groups said they have raised more
than $125,000 so far, and expect to spend $1 million or more, with
some of the money coming from Indian gambling businesses in other
states. Ron Allen, chairman of a tribe on Washington's Olympic
peninsula, called Gorton ``the most vociferous opponent of tribal
sovereignty that Congress has seen in 40 years,'' and said the
advertisements would focus on environmental and health issues.
Gorton told The Post-Intelligencer: ``They have a total right to do
what they want in the political world. I have a very good record on
supporting the appropriate ambitions of Indian peoples, but I will
continue to fiercely protect the rights of their non-Indian
neighbors. If they don't like that, they have every right to try to
beat me.'' &QL;

US DIET RECOMMENDATIONS REFLECT INDUSTRY COMPROMISES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal government's new dietary guidelines that President
Clinton will unveil Saturday contain this seemingly innocuous piece
of advice: ``Choose beverages and foods to moderate your intake of
sugar.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the word ``moderate,'' however, raged a three-year battle
that pitted the country's top nutritionists against massive
corporations and beet and sugarcane farmers. Eventually, some of
the most powerful voices in the US Senate intervened on behalf of
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome is a compromise as messy as any bill that grinds
through Capitol Hill. In the end, the scientists were forced to
give ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision they made is sensible. We're delighted they
didn't go along with the (scientists') original recommendation,''
said Richard Keelor, president and chief executive officer of the
Sugar Association, which represents the industry and lobbied
heavily during the process.
</P>
<P>
   The prize is more than just a few words in a government slogan.
The dietary guidelines regulate what the nation's largest food
purchaser, the federal government, can buy for the 53 million
mouths it feeds daily in the military, prisons, schools and
numerous other programs. Billions of dollars can move with the
shift of a word.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over the dietary guideline on sugar offers a glimpse
into the complex world of food politics.
</P>
<P>
   The new guidelines, which serve as the government's definitive
statement on food, contain more revisions than ever, though most
were uncontroversial. According to a copy obtained by the Globe,
the major changes are:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)The 1995 guidelines suggested eating a variety of foods.
The new ones say, let the food pyramid guide your choices.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)The new guidelines recommend eating a more plant-based
diet. The old guidelines were silent on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)The wording of the fat guideline was changed to emphasize
avoiding saturated fats, rather than all fats.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)The guidelines suggest striving for a ``healthy weight,''
rather than simply maintaining or improving weight.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)A new guideline recommends 30 minutes of moderate exercise
a day.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Another guideline addresses clean handling and preparing
of food to avoid foodborne illness.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Fruits and vegetables now have their own place in the
guidelines. Before, they were coupled with grains.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)The alcohol guideline is more stringent, eliminating
language on the pleasure of alcohol and detailing its negative
effects, while still approving a glass a day for adults.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is sugar.
</P>
<P>
   The panel of nutritionists that studied the issue for three
years urged the following recommendation: ``Choose beverages and
foods that limit your intake of sugars.'' They felt the 1995
guideline, ``Choose a diet moderate in sugar,'' was too vague.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does moderate mean? It's fuzzy. `Limit your intake' is
much clearer because it suggests a change in behavior,'' said Margo
Wootan, director of nutrition policy for the Center for Science in
the Public Interest, a Washington-based consumer advocacy group
that has followed the process from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the US Department of Agriculture convened a committee
of 11 of the country's most respected nutritionists who were
referred to the committee by their peers. Their mission was a
thorough review of the scientific literature pertaining to the
guidelines, a task undertaken every five years.
</P>
<P>
   The panel included three scientists from Tufts University and
one from Harvard University. Panel member Alice Lichtenstein, a
senior scientist in Tufts School of Nutrition Science and Policy,
said she hadn't given the guidelines much thought in the past but,
once serving on the committee, said she found the process to be
honest and free from conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process itself was really impressive. We were given a very
clear mandate at the beginning to take a fresh look at the
guidelines,'' she said. ``I felt no pressure during the entire
process.''
</P>
<P>
   According to some who attended public sessions while the
guidelines were being drawn up in Washington, sugar interests were
the strongest presence.
</P>
<P>
   But Keelor, of the Sugar Association, said, ``when we saw the
appointments on this committee, we became very concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the scientists on the committee were renowned for their
work on the connection between obesity and sugar _ a position the
sugar interests disputed in public and written testimony with their
own experts.
</P>
<P>
   Decreasing obesity rates is one of the dietary guidelines' prime
goals. Keelor argued for keeping the 1995 guideline, asserting that
the word ``limit,'' favored by the scientists' committee, would
signal to the public to heavily reduce sugar consumption, perhaps
even eliminate it. ``Moderate'' was more acceptable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other sugar interests joined in, the most prominent being the
International Food Information Council and National Food Processors
Association. At one public meeting, they issued a vague threat to
punish the USDA if they went along with the scientists. Their
stated weapon was Public Act 101-445, which established the
guidelines and requires a ``preponderance'' of medical data to
support any changes in them _ an argument that would later be made
by some powerful advocates.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists' committee plowed along. In January, the panel
issued its recommendation: ``Choose beverages and foods that limit
your intake of sugars.'' That left it in the hands of USDA
Secretary Dan Glickman and US Health and Human Services Secretary
Donna Shalala for approval.
</P>
<P>
   The sugar interests were outraged. They represent almost 400,000
people, many of them farmers concentrated in northern states like
Michigan, the Dakotas, Idaho and Wyoming, where beets thrive, as
well as Louisiana and Florida, home of sugar cane.
</P>
<P>
   On March 3, USDA Secretary Dan Glickman received a letter signed
by 30 senators, 22 Republicans and eight Democrats, mostly from
sugar farming states. They included several members of the Senate
committee that sets USDA's budget as well as Majority Leader Trent
Lott (R-Miss.).
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned that these recommendations may not meet the
legal requirement of Public Law 101-445. . .we hope you will review
this matter and find it appropriate with government guidelines to
withhold any new recommendations until and unless they are fully
supported by sound science,' the letter warned.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, the word ``limit'' was changed to
``moderate.''

4 GOP HOPEFULS FOR SENATE IN N.J. ATTACK DEMOCRATS, NOT ONE
ANOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ In the last televised debate of the New Jersey
primary for U.S. Senate, the four Republican candidates cordially
discussed their differences Friday on gun control, school vouchers
and foreign affairs, saving their criticism for their two
Democratic opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign of the changing dynamics of the race, the Democrat
who received the most condemnation was Jon Corzine, the former Wall
Street executive whose $30 million in campaign spending has
shattered records for a Senate candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, Republicans had aimed almost exclusively at
Corzine's Democratic opponent, Jim Florio. Most recent polls now
show Corzine leading the Democratic race, however, and with
Corzine's record-breaking spending on the front pages of many New
Jersey newspapers, the Republicans have apparently changed targets.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Republican contenders, James Treffinger, the Essex
County executive, declared in Friday's debate that Corzine's
spending was ``obscene'' and that it ``perverts the process'' of
electoral politics.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Franks ridiculed Corzine's calls for expansive new
social programs. He said the programs were out of touch with New
Jerseyans because they would be so expensive as to require a tax
increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply can't afford it,'' Franks said. ``We're all not as
wealthy as Jon Corzine.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would support tighter campaign spending laws,
including a limit on the total amount a candidate could spend,
William Gormley, a Republican state senator from Atlantic County,
predicted that Corzine's campaign would disgust the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet the people of New Jersey are going to put a limit on
that personal fortune,'' Gormley said. ``He believes in spending
money and he believes in big government and the Republicans believe
in the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Murray Sabrin, the former Libertarian who is now running
for the Republican nomination, did not object to Corzine's campaign
spending. Sabrin said he also opposed any limits on campaign
contributions because he considers such restrictions an
infringement on the freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was sponsored by the League of Women Voters and is
scheduled to be broadcast at 3 p.m. Saturday and 10 a.m. Sunday on
WPVI in Philadelphia and WABC in New York. The league had also
invited the Democratic candidates to hold a separate debate to be
televised on network television, and Florio accepted. But Corzine
declined, so that debate was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   While Gormley and Franks are the two best-known candidates, the
only polls available show that at least 40 percent of likely
Republican primary voters are undecided. The three Republican
debates have allowed each candidate to sharpen his image with the
public, but none of the contenders claims to have scored any major
victories in the encounters.
</P>
<P>
   The format of Friday's debate consisted of a panel of
journalists who asked questions of each candidate. But candidates
were not allowed to rebut one another or ask one another questions,
so the tone of the discourse was tame, almost to the point of
courtliness.
</P>
<P>
   All four candidates said they supported the death penalty, a
plan to invest some Social Security funds in the stock market, and
expanded trade relations with China. Franks, Gormley and Treffinger
also said that Gov. Christie Whitman, who has not endorsed a
primary candidate, deserved praise for her efforts to stop racial
profiling by the New Jersey State Police. Sabrin tried to turn that
question into a denunciation of affirmative action, which he called
``the ultimate form of racial profiling.'' He urged his colleagues
to state their position on the policy.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue was not raised again.
</P>
<P>
   Franks, the only Republican contender who has served in
Washington, often cited his congressional experience.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about taxes, he took credit for helping to write the
balanced budget and for forcing President Clinton ``kicking and
screaming down the path to fiscal responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Gormley, who appeared the most relaxed of all the candidates,
continued to emphasize his strong support of gun control
legislation, an unusual tactic in a Republican primary. Gormley
also sought to stress his opposition to the fiscal policies Florio
carried out as governor because Franks' campaign literature has
accused him of being a ``Florio Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Treffinger, a former Democrat, portrayed himself as the
candidate best able to broaden the Republican Party's appeal.
Citing his record at trimming Essex County's budget and his support
of vouchers for private schools, Treffinger said he could help
Republicans win back the working-class voters who now identify with
Democrats. ``We Republicans represent the working families,''
Treffinger said, ''and more importantly, we represent the forgotten
Americans.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Seymour S. Kety, a major figure in the field of biological
psychiatry whose contributions revolutionized the study of
schizophrenia and other major mental illnesses and yielded novel
methods for studying the human brain at work, died on Thursday at
his home in Westwood, Mass. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   In giving him its 1999 Award for Special Achievement in Medical
Science, the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation cited Kety's
discovery, in the late 1940s and early '50s, of the first
quantitative technique for measuring blood flow in the living
brain, a method that eventually led to the development of modern
technologies like PET scanning.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation also recognized Kety for his work on
schizophrenia, the first to provide strong evidence that the
illness ran in families, an indication that heredity played a
significant role. The studies, which used Danish national birth
registries to track the transmission of the illness in people
separated at birth from their biological families, helped overturn
the then-prevailing wisdom that schizophrenia was caused by bad
parenting.
</P>
<P>
   Schizophrenia is not entirely genetic; environmental stressors,
as yet not completely understood, appear to trigger the illness in
those with a genetic vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Kety's studies also laid the groundwork for efforts to identify
specific genes that might predispose a person to develop the
disease, efforts that continue to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that 10 percent of the biological relatives of
schizophrenic adoptees have the disorder themselves,'' Kety told an
interviewer upon receiving the Lasker Award, ``a fivefold higher
prevalence than exists in the general population.''
</P>
<P>
   As the first scientific director of the new National Institute
of Mental Health in the early 1950s, Kety also helped shift the
direction of psychiatric research, putting much greater emphasis on
the biological bases of mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, psychoanalysis dominated most academic psychiatry
departments, but Kety ``believed that there were physiological and
chemical problems that lay behind mental disease,'' said Dr. Louis
Sokoloff, chief of the laboratory of cerebral metabolism at the
mental health institute, who worked with Kety as a postdoctoral
student at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   In bestowing its award, the Lasker Foundation noted that Kety's
``visionary leadership in mental health,'' helped usher
``psychiatry into the molecular age.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death, Kety (pronounced KET-ty) was an
emeritus professor of neuroscience at the Harvard Medical School,
having retired in 1983 after 15 years, and until three years ago he
was senior psychobiologist at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Seymour Solomon Kety was born in Philadelphia. He graduated Phi
Beta Kappa in 1936 from the University of Pennsylvania, where he
received his M.D. in 1940. He entered Harvard Medical School as a
National Research Council fellow in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Kety taught and conducted research at Penn before becoming
scientific director at the institute. As a researcher in
physiology, he made many significant contributions to the field,
including a seminal 1951 paper on the mechanisms of gas exchange
between blood and the body tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after arriving at the mental health institute, Sokoloff
said, Kety found himself under pressure from his colleagues to
undergo psychoanalysis _ a treatment considered de rigueur for
practicing psychiatrists at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Kety, Sokoloff said, ``didn't have much interest in
psychoanalysis, but they kept hounding him, and they finally said
the institute would pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   That evening, Sokoloff continued, Kety remarked to his wife,
Josephine, that maybe he should take advantage of the institute's
offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, suppose they offered you a free appendectomy,'' Sokoloff
said his wife replied, ``would you take that?''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1960s, Kety briefly left the mental health institute
to become chairman of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University. But
clinical practice was not his first love, Sokoloff said, and he
soon returned to the institute and to basic research.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, he joined the psychiatry faculty at Harvard, becoming
director of the psychiatric research laboratory at Massachusetts
General Hospital, where he remained until 1977, when he accepted a
similar position at the Mailman Research Center at McLean.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife of 60 years, Dr. Josephine Gross
Kety; a son, Lawrence; a daughter, Roberta; and two grandchildren.

ACTOR FRANCIS LEDERER, 100 DIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Francis Lederer, a Czech-born actor whose dark good
looks made him a suave, continental character in films from the
silent era through the 1950s and who continued to teach weekly
acting classes in Los Angeles until just a few weeks ago, died on
Thursday at his home in Palm Springs, Calif. He was 100.
</P>
<P>
   Lederer's career spanned the century from ``Pandora's Box,'' the
1929 German silent film in which Louise Brooks made a scandalous
splash as Lulu the prostitute, to the television series ``Mission
Impossible'' and ``Night Gallery,'' in which he played guest roles
four decades later. He also played assorted rogues, charmers,
horror villains and a Nazi spy opposing Edward G. Robinson in the
1939 Warner Brothers drama, ``Confessions of a Nazi Spy.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Midnight,'' Billy Wilder's 1939 comedy that starred Don
Ameche and Claudette Colbert, Lederer played a typical part:
Jacques Picot, a gigolo attached to Mary Astor. In its review at
the time, Variety said Lederer was ``aptly cast as the love
pirate.'' With a slight accent and silken air, he played a
philandering actor who accidentally kisses Ida Lupino in a darkened
theater in ``One Rainy Afternoon'' (1936), and a sinister valet who
stalks Paulette Goddard in Jean Renoir's ``Diary of a Chambermaid''
(1946).
</P>
<P>
   Frantisek Lederer was born in Prague, which was then part of
Austria-Hungary. He was an established stage actor in Europe by the
1920s, in Shakespeare to Sir Noel Coward, in German, making his
first big hit in Berlin as Romeo opposite Elisabeth Bergner's
Juliet. He began making films, including ``Pandora's Box,''
directed by G.W. Pabst, in which he was billed as Franz Lederer,
and played the son of a prominent man seduced by the doomed, amoral
Lulu, who is himself seduced by her as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely adored her, she was a mysterious person,
perfectly cast for that part,'' Lederer once said of Brooks, who
became a Jazz Age icon of sexuality. ``We couldn't talk. She didn't
speak a word of German. I didn't speak a word of English. We just
looked at each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Lederer came to Broadway in 1932, to repeat his London stage
success in a play called ``Autumn Crocus,'' and was soon being
billed by RKO Pictures as the ``newest and most popular New York
matinee idol.'' He told reporters at the time that he was a
confirmed bachelor and that ``domesticity would kill me, yes kill
me.''
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, as Louella Parsons reported some time later, he was
already married to Ada Nejedly, a European opera singer he later
divorced. He was then married to Maria Marguerita Guadalupe Teresa
Estela Bolado Castilla y O'Donnell, the actress known as Margo, for
three years, before finally settling down in 1941 with the former
Marion Irvine of Toronto, who survives him.
</P>
<P>
   The Lederers, who had no children, lived on a ranch in the San
Fernando Valley community Canoga Park, of which Lederer was
honorary mayor for more than 20 years, before moving to Palm
Springs after their home was damaged in the 1994 Northridge
earthquake. After his movie career dwindled to forgettable roles
like a vampire in ``The Return of Dracula'' in 1958, he began an
acting workshop that became the American National Academy of
Performing Arts in Los Angeles and continued to teach a Tuesday
night class there until a few weeks ago, driving in from the
desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Francis always kept his hand in the theater,'' Lederer's widow
said in a telephone interview. In later years, he played the father
in the national tour of ``The Diary of Anne Frank,'' and appeared
in other plays. In 1998 he was featured in a television documentary
about Brooks, ``Looking for Lulu.''
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong pacifist since his elder brother was killed in World
War I, Lederer once told The Desert Sun of Palm Springs that he was
most proud of having formed an antiwar group, the World Peace
Federation, in 1934, to urge nations to ``outlaw war by nationwide
vote.''

EWING DIAGNOSIS NOT SO BAD, BUT HIS RETURN ISN'T ASSURED 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BKN-PACERS) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ Just minutes after a group of subtly confident
Knicks took their places on the court to begin preparing for a
dramatic re-enactment of last year's Eastern Conference finals, a
black limousine eased into the parking lot of the team's practice
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing unfolded his body, emerged from behind the tinted
windows and walked with normal strides as a security guard ushered
him inside. Unlike last year on the day after Game 2 against
Indiana, he wasn't wearing an ominous cast as an accessory. Friday,
a partly disquieted but mostly relieved Ewing was fresh from a
magnetic resonance imaging test that revealed neither a tear nor a
rupture. The pain in his sore right foot, which caused him to exit
the floor six minutes into Game 2 on Thursday night in Indiana, was
diagnosed as acute peroneal tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   Although the injury does not generate the same grave reaction as
the partly torn Achilles' tendon that ended Ewing's season last
year, the Knicks have no idea when and if their center will return
during a best-of-7 series that the Pacers lead, 2-0. A decision on
whether Ewing will return for Saturday's Game 3 at Madison Square
Garden will be made just before tip-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to ice it all day today, get treatment, and
re-evaluate it tomorrow,'' said Ewing, who believes he injured his
foot when he pump-faked Dale Davis at the 5-minute-20-second mark
of the first quarter. ``It's a little better than it was last
night. Last night I could hardly walk. I'm able to walk around a
little better.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the pain is bearable, I think I'll be fine. But if not, I
won't be playing.''
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, Kurt Thomas will most likely slip into the
starter's role. And if Ewing is on the bench, the Knicks will
quickly find out if their serendipitous trip through the conference
finals last year was just a special and singular occasion or an
us-against-the-world performance that can be duplicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won last year without Patrick,'' Charlie Ward said.
``Nothing is going to shake us. It's the same situation, same
scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is one pivotal difference this year. The Knicks did
not split the first two games, they dropped both. Their margin for
error is microscopic. And the pressure is much more intense. If
Ewing does not play, the miracle workers from last year will have
to perform. Can the team's remaining low-post threat, Larry
Johnson, find his same 3-point touch? Can Allan Houston and Latrell
Sprewell re-create their inspirational play? Will Marcus Camby
begin finishing with the same force around the basket?
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers have already put a dent into the Knicks' ability to
answer those questions. In two games, Ewing's co-stars have
struggled. To be more effective, Houston cannot continue to be
lured into the kind of foul trouble that has reduced his playing
time to 34 minutes against Indiana. Although he is faced with the
flop-happy Reggie Miller, a crafty guard who can look like a bird
crashing into a glass pane at the slightest contact, Houston has to
play smarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be aggressive and more assertive, but when you get
offensive fouls because he's flopping, that's hard,'' Houston said.
``I just want it to be called both ways. But I'm not going to do
the antics he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller does seem to major in theater. And it has gotten the best
of the Knicks beyond Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to make it look like you put a gun to him and shot
him,'' said Sprewell, who also picks up Miller on occasion.
``Marcus Camby barely touched him on a flagrant foul call last
night, and he's so good, he's on the floor. You'd think Marcus
killed him. He's good at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller is not the only foul magnet, though. Over two games, the
Pacers have taken 50 attempts _ 14 alone by Jalen Rose _ compared
with 35 for the Knicks. Down the stretch of Game 2, the Pacers
wisely made their way to the free-throw line while the Knicks lost
loose balls, became jump-shot-oriented and blew the game.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell was part of the problem. He was zero for four in the
fourth quarter. Over the last 10 playoff games, he is a troublesome
four for 31. For the Knicks to have a chance without Ewing,
Sprewell has to decode the mystery to his fourth-quarter
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very aware of it,'' said Sprewell, whose last miss of Game
2 came on a made-to-order, game-tying jumper over the
5-foot-11-inch Travis Best with 5.8 seconds left. ``You're not
thinking about it when you're playing, but right now, of course _
you're wondering what's going on. But again, like that last shot,
you can't let that stuff affect you and how you play.''

EWING'S PRESENCE REQUESTED BY PACERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BKN-KNICKS) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Reggie Miller's comments before the series
notwithstanding, the Indiana Pacers do have some mushy feelings
toward the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   While the Pacers hate that the Knicks have been their bane of
playoffs past, they are not beyond appreciating and admiring the
work of New York's basketball gladiator, the one who has been every
bit as long-suffering as they have been in his quest for a
championship.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the Pacers hope to see Patrick Ewing in uniform
and in action Saturday at Madison Square Garden. Just before the
game, it will be decided whether or not Ewing, who sprained his
right ankle six minutes into Game 2 on Thursday, can play in Game
3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather he played,'' Miller said Friday after a light
practice at John Jay College in Manhattan. ``He's a great warrior.
He's been a great competitor throughout the years, so I hope he's
suited up come Saturday. You always want the best players out on
the floor to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jackson, who was mentored by Ewing while playing for the
Knicks early in his career, said: ``Being a friend, I wish nothing
but the best for him. It's to no benefit of mine to hope he's hurt
and call myself a true friend. I hope he's fine and I hope he suits
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments of the Pacers, whose sentiments were supported by
their coach, Larry Bird, were made in all sincerity. But one can't
help wondering if the Knicks' success against them without Ewing
plays at least a small part in their desire to see him on the
block, calling for the ball and wheeling for that turnaround
jumper.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more than anyone, the Pacers, who lead this series 2-0,
are aware of how the Knicks can morph into a different, sleeker
opponent when Ewing is sidelined.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers became the unwitting victims of a speedy, daring
Knicks team that no one knew existed after Ewing missed the final
four games of last year's Eastern Conference championship with a
partly torn Achilles' tendon.
</P>
<P>
   After Ewing went down with the series tied at one game apiece,
the Knicks of Latrell Sprewell, Allan Houston, Larry Johnson and
Marcus Camby beat the Pacers in three of four games.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Pacers somewhat remade themselves this season,
trading away the bruising Antonio Davis in the off-season in an
attempt to keep pace with the Knicks, who had overwhelmed Indiana
with their athleticism once Ewing went out.
</P>
<P>
   While saying that the Pacers subconsciously let up after Ewing
left the series, Miller acknowledged that the game became more
difficult for him and his partner on the wing, Jalen Rose, when
Ewing was not around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it was tougher last year,'' Miller said. ``I think we
somewhat let our guard down when he went down. All it does is
really put more pressure on Jalen and myself because we know
Latrell and Allan will probably get 20 shots apiece now. I think
now the team knows that the offense really is going to run through
those two guys' hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller also said that Rik Smits, the Pacers' 33-year-old center
who lumbers on bad feet, was better off playing against the equally
cumbersome Ewing rather than against Kurt Thomas or Marcus Camby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Rik would prefer to go against Patrick size-wise and
age-wise,'' Miller said. ``They both move the same because they're
up there in age. I think when you put a younger, more athletic _
and in Kurt Thomas a little bit more physical player _ on Rik, it
kind of changes his game a little bit. He went from no fouls in the
third quarter to picking up four quick fouls, so I think he's going
to have to adjust a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Smits agreed, saying: ``I prefer playing Ewing. I've gotten to
know him a lot better than the other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers refused to say that the Knicks were better without
Ewing, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not as good a basketball team without Patrick,''
Jackson said. ``No knock. But they're still a dangerous team.
They're still a team that knocked us out last year without him.
They do different things. We just have to adjust.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Ewing plays or not, the Pacers said their mind would
remain set on avenging the stunning defeat last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my heart of hearts, I don't care if he plays,'' Rose said.
``I want to win the game. We've been down this road before with
Patrick in, Patrick out. He is a tremendous warrior for their team,
and I don't think they're a better team without him. Whatever it
takes for us to win, though, I'll take it.''

SUPPORTERS MARK 5TH ANNIVERSARY OF TEXAS HANDGUN LAW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Robert James Eichelberg remembered as if it were
yesterday the morning in 1997 when a would-be carjacker pointed a
gun at him through the passenger window of his pickup at a Houston
intersection.
</P>
<P>
   ``(It was) early morning. No sun, no moon, no lights,''
Eichelberg said Friday. ``I had stopped at a busy intersection and
the guy ran up ... and put a gun up to the window. I looked at him
and all I could see was his face and the end of a gun, the barrel.
... I felt trapped. I drew a gun that I carry in my truck and I
fired ... through the window.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments came during a capital press conference marking the
fifth anniversary of the law that gives Texans the right to carry
concealed handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only reason I'm alive today,'' Eichelberg said of
the law.
</P>
<P>
   The news conference was called by supporters of the legislation
as they ratcheted up their verbal warfare with opponents, accusing
groups such as Texans Against Gun Violence and the Violence Policy
Center of ``walking over the bodies of the dead to further their
cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Former state Sen. Jerry Patterson, the chief sponsor of the
concealed handgun law during the 1995 legislative session, said all
of the doomsday predictions about the law have failed to
materialize, yet opponents continue to misrepresent data about
crimes allegedly committed by those licensed to carry concealed
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   As proof, he offered a study analyzing data collected by the
Texas Department of Public Safety.
</P>
<P>
   William Sturdevant, a Navasota, Texas, engineer who conducted
the analysis, said, ``Your average Joe down the street is eight
times more likely to assault you than'' someone licensed to carry a
handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Sturdevant said his analysis of DPS arrest data from 1996
through 1998, the first three years the law was in effect, is the
most detailed to date on arrest records of those who have permits
to carry handguns.
</P>
<P>
   He said he conducted the study in response to a report earlier
this year by the Violence Policy Center, a national nonprofit
organization working to fight firearms violence, and Texans Against
Gun Violence. The study claimed that the arrest rate of Texans with
handgun permits is more than twice the arrest rate of the general
population.
</P>
<P>
   Sturdevant contended that opponents of the law have inaccurately
analyzed data, using methodology that could just as easily show
that having a Texas driver's license increases the violent crime
rate and threatens public safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strength is we tell the truth,'' added Patterson, shortly
before proponents sliced into a birthday cake decorated like the
Texas flag and bearing a banner that read, ``Happy Birthday
Concealed Hand Gun law.''
</P>
<P>
   Nina Butts of Texans Against Gun Violence, however, said her
group used the same data source as Patterson's _ DPS arrest
figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Patterson's assertion that far more people in the
general population are arrested than concealed handgun licensees
are arrested is not impressive to me,'' she said. ``Certainly we
would expect persons licensed to carry a loaded handgun would be
highly responsible, law-abiding citizens. ... The state was not
supposed to be licensing murderers and rapists.''
</P>
<P>
   She cited a recent national news magazine story that stated that
27 Texans licensed to carry handguns have been arrested for murder,
49 for sexual assault and eight for kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Sturdevant, however, argued that arrest records are misleading
because ``any time a concealed handgun licensee uses a handgun in
self-defense he pretty much gets arrested.'' Most of those arrests
do not result in indictments or convictions he added.
</P>
<P>
   But Butts insisted that arrest records do tell a story.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to make the case it has enhanced public safety
and prevented crime,'' she said. ``I don't see it. They trotted out
one guy with one story. They had one anecdote. It's true crime is
down in Texas but you would be hard-pressed to attribute it to''
the concealed-carry law.
</P>
<P>
   Eichelberg, meanwhile, said he would never recommend his course
of action to anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are instantly blinded and deafened'' by the gun blast, he
said. After he shot at his assailant, James Earl Turner, Eichelberg
ran down the street with Turner in pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   They fired five times at each other, Eichelberg said. Turner
missed with all five of his shots, but Eichelberg hit his target
each time.
</P>
<P>
   Turner survived the shooting and was eventually sentenced to 50
years in prison on aggravated robbery and aggravated assault
charges under the state's habitual criminal law.

SELLING THE FARM, PARK AVENUE STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also LEUCADIA-RELIANCE) 
 By LESLIE EATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette held a garage sale
before their downfall, it probably looked a lot like the scene on
Friday at Sotheby's, where Saul and Gayfryd Steinberg offered to
unload hundreds of their possessions, from a multimillion-dollar
commode to the living room curtains.
</P>
<P>
   That was not all Steinberg sold on Friday. Reliance Group
Holdings, the insurance company that he had owned for three decades
and which has been teetering on the brink of insolvency, announced
that an investment concern would buy Reliance for the fire-sale
price of $2.55 a share.
</P>
<P>
   It is a stunning twist in the story of a Wall Street wunderkind
turned corporate raider who, with his glamorous young wife, took
New York society by storm in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   While the Steinbergs were well known for their generous
charitable contributions, they were also infamous for a certain
``let them eat cake'' extravagance. There was, for example, the
million-dollar birthday party Gayfryd Steinberg gave for her
husband's 50th in 1989, at which models dressed up to look like his
favorite old-master paintings. (He is selling those, too.)
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the enormous Park Avenue penthouse, once John D.
Rockefeller's and, at 34 rooms and 19,000 square feet, very likely
the largest apartment in New York. (It, too, has been sold, to a
Wall Street financier for over $30 million.)
</P>
<P>
   As for the furnishings, well, based on the auction Friday, if it
wasn't gold, the Steinbergs did not own it. Unless, perhaps, it was
ormolu-encrusted, bronze-mounted, rose-strewn, fringed, tasseled,
brocaded, or covered with gilded sphinxes and sea serpents. Or
someone else's family crest.
</P>
<P>
   There were marble-topped gilt tables with gold lions' heads, and
brocade-covered gilt benches with gold lions' feet, and a
velvet-clad gilt settee wearing what looked like a gold-feathered
crown. There was a 21-foot-long dining room table and 23 mahogany
chairs. There was a pair of gold-and-red porcelain jars on
gilt-wood stands that were just shy of 5 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   The Steinbergs did not respond to requests, made through
Sotheby's, for an interview. According to the catalog, they plan to
move to a smaller place now that they have only one child living at
home.
</P>
<P>
   However grand (or grandiose) their furniture, the Steinbergs
were not the sort of people who worried that guests would put their
glasses on the furniture and make rings, said Duane Hampton, whose
late husband, Mark, decorated the apartment with the Steinbergs.
``It was much more comfortable than you could ever imagine,'' she
said. ``It wasn't as off-putting as you think.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of the Memorial Day weekend, only about 50
people were in the auction room at any one time during the almost
six-hour event, and much of the buying was done by dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The auction raised $12.5 million, including the commissions
charged to buyers, which is about what Sotheby's had estimated
before the sale. A few things failed to sell, including the
curtains and a pair of chintz sofas.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There was a time when $12 million would have sounded like an
absurdly small sum to be mentioned in the same breath as Steinberg,
who began making his fortune shortly after graduating from the
Wharton School in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, he began Leasco, which leased out computers
in the days when they were new and expensive and the size of a
truck.
</P>
<P>
   When the company went public in 1965, it and Steinberg became
darlings on Wall Street, which was then in the throes of a
stock-market mania similar to the recent passion for technology
stocks. Just three years later, he took over Reliance, a stodgy
insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing decades, Steinberg bought and sold companies
right and left, but he became most famous for the deals he did not
make. His 1969 run at Chemical Bank failed. In 1984, Disney paid
him $60 million to go away, in what critics dubbed ``greenmail.''
It was a charge that would dog him throughout his deals in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, he married Gayfryd, his third wife, and she was
soon known for her elaborate dinner parties and her scarlet and
gold living room. The couple were fixtures on the charity circuit.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 Gayfryd Steinberg quit her post as president of PEN, the
literary group, after the writer Ken Auletta said she and her
husband were trying to use the group to gain respectability (he had
previously called Saul Steinberg sleazy).
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, shareholders began to complain about
Steinberg's management, contending that he ran Reliance not for the
stockholders' benefit but for his family's. They continued to own
much of the stock, and several Steinberg relatives worked there.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Steinberg had a mild stroke, at 55.
</P>
<P>
   But he remained president of Reliance until February, when the
company's troubles could be ignored no longer. Reliance had lost
over $310 million in 1999 because of problems in the commercial
property and casualty business and its involvement in a
controversial workers compensation program. The stock price had
plunged from almost $20 in 1998 to well under $3.
</P>
<P>
   Burdened with more than $700 million of debt, much of which was
about to come due, Reliance was forced in February to sell its only
profitable business; Steinberg stepped aside as chief executive,
though he remained chairman.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, that all ended. Leucadia National Corp. agreed to buy
Reliance for the equivalent of $2.55 a share in Leucadia stock and
to assume the debt. Wall Street estimates that Steinberg will
receive Leucadia shares worth about $93 million.
</P>
<P>
   How much of that he will keep is unclear, in part because the
Steinberg family in the past has borrowed money against the value
of their shares. A year ago his shares were worth more than $350
million.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their future, it seems unlikely that the Steinbergs
will soon resume their gold-plated place in New York's
consciousness. In the Sotheby's catalog, Gayfryd Steinberg suggests
that the family would be living in a less colorful way. ``Funnily
enough,'' she said, ``I have kept a lot of brown furniture, which I
never thought I would when I started years ago.''

SPORTS COLUMN: KNICKS WANT EWING, BUT NOT AS HALF A HERO 
</HEADLINE>
  By IRA BERKOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ Sometime before the conventional strobes and
smoke and amplified din _ as appealing as a car alarm _ herald the
beginning of Saturday afternoon's amusements in Madison Square
Garden, Regis Van Gundy will sit down with a very tall person and
ask him, eventually, if this is indeed his final answer.
</P>
<P>
   The reply will simply be yes or no.
</P>
<P>
   The question, of course, will be whether Patrick Ewing, his
starting center, can play against the Pacers, as the Knicks return
home, feeling as wan as if they'd found a caterpillar in their
salad. They are down, two games to none, in the Eastern Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be his call whether he starts or not,'' Van Gundy
said. ``It'll be my call as to how much he plays.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Jeff Van Gundy, as he switches hats from quiz master to
basketball coach, will learn in just what shape is the large right
foot of Ewing, who sprained it during Thursday night's game in
Indianapolis and is suffering from acute tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   If the answer is yes, that he can play, then that gives the
Knicks just one more arrow _ and a significant one _ in their
quiver. If it's no _ or even a yes, but one that turns out to be
spurious _ then there must be another mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Patrick,'' Van Gundy said Friday, ``that he should play
only if he feels he can be effective.'' In other words, half a hero
is no hero. ``I told our guys that we can't focus on Patrick being
there. I mean, Indiana is coming in for the kill. They're not
planning to give a game away. We have to be at our best.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ewing is a no-show, or a diminished-show, how will that
affect the Knicks?
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time that they had to go into a skirmish
without Ewing. Last year he also was injured in Game 2 of the
conference finals, in Indianapolis, and the Knicks went on to beat
the Pacers in the series.
</P>
<P>
   When Ewing went out Thursday 7 minutes into the game, the Knicks
played superbly until partway through the last quarter, when their
defense looked like they were vacationing in Aruba. And, despite
not having Ewing for the last 41 minutes of the game, they were
tied with Indiana with just seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   It is also no secret that the team is faster without Ewing, with
Marcus Camby and even Chris Dudley running in transition.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the opinion here that Ewing is playing some of the
best basketball of his life. Sure, at 37 years old, with banged-up
back, wrist, knees, and now foot, he has had suppler days, days in
which his body didn't feel as if it were being held together by
clothespins. But he is playing team defense, boxing out for
rebounds and taking better percentage shots than usual. The last
halves of the last two games in Miami _ the last shots of those
last games, in particular, the stuffed rebound and the base-line
drive _ were classics, the Hamlet, Beethoven's 5th, the Bart
Simpsons of game-enders.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are still vestiges, at least, of the old
Patrick. He still goes for head fakes as if it were impolite not
to. Last game, a hobbled Rik Smits lifts his head as if he has an
itch, and Ewing does his best Captain Marvel shtick and flies past
him in a vain attempt to block the shot that wasn't shot. And Smits
then pops in two points. And Ewing, after all these years, still
hasn't made a pretty pass, or it escaped me.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Patrick was out before,'' said Latrell Sprewell, the
Knicks small forward who has a bruised left thigh, ``other guys
like Duds and Marcus and Kurt Thomas got the opportunity to play,
and stepped up. They knew we needed them, and they came through. We
stayed together as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   In practice Friday, they went through drills without Ewing, who
was nursing his foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's feeling better today than it did yesterday,'' he said.
``Yesterday I could hardly walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, of course, he was injured and watched the last four
games of the Pacer series and the finals against San Antonio in
dress clothes on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important,'' said Chris Childs, the Knicks point guard
who himself has a painful knee, ``is that whoever steps on the
court gives a 110 percent. If Patrick is out there and helping us,
that's a bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the worth of Ewing would be made clear by who is
rooting for him not to play. It's the Pacers.

MEMO LISTS DELEGATES AND CASH PAYMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Salt Lake City officials on Friday released a document that
appeared to outline the plan for cash payments and other illicit
favors that blossomed into an embarrassing scandal in the securing
of the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Two delegates of the International Olympic Committee not
previously connected to the Salt Lake City scandal were implicated
in the document. They face possible sanctioning by the IOC's ethics
commission, which said it would investigate the 28-page document.
</P>
<P>
   Ten committee delegates resigned or were dismissed last year
after it was revealed that Salt Lake City officials had spent more
than $3 million on a program of providing cash payments, medical
benefits, scholarships and other favors in an attempt to win the
2002 Games.
</P>
<P>
   Revelations about other Olympic bids have implicated about a
third of the IOC's 114 delegates in some form of inappropriate
activity and clearly established that many people were aware of
which delegates had sought special favors in return for their
votes.
</P>
<P>
   The memo released Friday is known as the geld document, because
``geld'' _ the German word for money _ is next to the names of a
handful of IOC delegates. It cannot be fully interpreted because it
contains no dates. It is not known whether the document reflected a
strategy of influence or was an archive of payments or favors
handed out.
</P>
<P>
   The committee decided on Thursday to release the document after
the Justice Department, which had been given the document, said it
did not intend to indict the Salt Lake City Organizing Committee as
a whole. The department said it did not preclude indicting
individual officials involved in the bid. Three people have already
been indicted.
</P>
<P>
   The document was believed to have been retrieved from a computer
belonging to Dave Johnson, who, along with Tom Welch, was a chief
architect of Salt Lake City's bid for the 2002 Winter Games, said
an Olympic official who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Documents revealing the personal tastes of IOC members have
previously been made public. However, the geld document is the
first in which direct references to money were made. Some of the
references in the document were benign, like the notation that the
late Rene Essomba of Cameroon loved bow ties. But the word ``geld''
was also next to Essomba's name, as was the fact that his daughter
was in college in Washington. It was the revelation of her
scholarship that brought the scandal to light.
</P>
<P>
   The word geld also appeared next to the names of two persons not
previously linked to the Salt Lake scandal: Francis Nyangweso of
Uganda and Tony Bridge of Jamaica. They will be investigated by the
IOC's ethics commission. Nyangweso's name surfaced in regard to the
bid by Sidney, Australia, for the 2000 Summer Games when he was
promised $35,000 the night before Sydney narrowly defeated Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the IOC have asked how, with the same names surfacing
repeatedly in various bids, committee officials could say they had
not known about illicit favors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I continue to say I didn't know about the activities of Salt
Lake City,'' said Anita DeFrantz, a delegate from the United
States.

 &HT;    Unser Jr. learns about determination from his daughter
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ She is the other teen-age girl who has a lot to
do with Sunday's running of the Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   She, too, is charming, gutsy and seems wise beyond her years,
but she's not the one who qualified for the race at 220 mph. She's
not Sarah Fisher. She's Cody Unser and from the chest down, she
can't move at all.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the 13-year-old girl finally made her dad move in the
direction his heart had been pulling him for four years. Cody is a
big reason Al Unser Jr. is finally back where he belongs _ back at
the Indy 500, the race the Unsers, like no other family, have
defined with with five decades of blood, sweat and cheers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents are supposed to set the example for their children,''
Unser said, ``but sometimes it turns out to be the other way
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen months ago, Cody _ she of the long blond hair, hazel
eyes and indomitable Unser spirit _ was playing basketball at her
middle school when she suddenly got an intense migraine headache.
The way she described it, ``on a scale from 1 to 10, it was 100.''
She felt a tingle in her legs, a dizziness and then she collapsed.
She was taken to the hospital and a day later she couldn't move.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors diagnosed her problem as transverse myelitis, a rare and
supposedly incurable neurological infection of her spinal cord. She
ended up confined to a wheelchair, but her dad wasn't sure quite
where he was anymore. ``It turned my world upside down,'' Unser
said. ``I felt helpless to do something for my daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, it was but another of a series of blows that left
Unser reeling: His 18-year marriage to Shelley _ his high school
sweetheart and the mother of their four children _ was
disintegrating into divorce. His once stellar racing career was
mired in a winless slump that would extend for an amazing 4 1/2
years and 73 races.
</P>
<P>
   This was the same guy who had won the Indianapolis 500 in 1992
and 1994, had won two CART championships, won in prototype sports
cars at Daytona and won two International Race of Champions (IROC)
all-star titles in stock cars.
</P>
<P>
   But after gulping milk in Victory Lane after the Indy 500 in
1994, he became the first defending champ ever to fail to make the
race the following year. He didn't qualify in 1995 and the
following year the sport was ripped apart by an open-wheel civil
war that found almost all of the top teams and drivers boycotting
the Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   CART has run a Memorial Day weekend race of its own, but it's
never been an equal of the Indy 500. And no one felt it more than
Unser. He was one of the most popular drivers ever to race here and
his family had had more success here than any other. Unser faces
pop up nine times on the massive Warner Borg Trophy given the 500
winner.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Unser's two wins, his dad _ Al Sr. _ won here four times
and his uncle Bobby has three victories. But the family legacy has
more than triumph woven into its fabric. There has been terrible
loss at Indy, as well.
</P>
<P>
   After Louie Unser failed to make the race in 1940, Jerry Unser _
a brother to Al Sr. and Bobby _ made his debut in 1958. On the
first lap, he got tangled in a 15 car pile-up and his car was sent
airborne over the first turn. He ended up with a bum shoulder. A
year later he was not so lucky. A fiery practice crash left him
with severe burns and two weeks later he died.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry's son Johnny is part of the third wave of Unsers. He
debuted here in 1996 and will start on the outside of Row 10 on
Sunday. Bobby's son Robby drove in the race the past two years and
then there's Al Jr., who debuted in 1983 and Sunday _ for the first
time in six years _ will be back in the line-up, starting on the
outside of Row 6.
</P>
<P>
   There has been at least one Unser in the Indy 500 field for 36
of the past 37 years and Sunday marks the 31st time that two Unsers
have started the same race.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Al Jr. was beside himself when he joined the CART
walkout in 1996: ``The low point came in May that year. We were
running a race (the quickly assembled US 500) at Michigan. I'm
going down the back straight and there was no grandstand. All the
way around the track, the seats were maybe half-filled. It was a
huge letdown not to be at the Indy 500. I just felt empty. I felt
like I had big hole in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The hole got deeper last May when he came to Indy on race day to
support his two cousins, who both were in the field. He walked with
them and his Uncle Bobby to the starting grid and the crowd began
to cheer him and call out his name. Suddenly, he found himself in
tears.
</P>
<P>
   About then is when his daughter came in and gave him the lesson
he needed. ``Cody never gave up,'' Unser said. ``From the day she
was diagnosed she went after what she wanted with all the power she
had. The challenges she faces everyday are well beyond anything I
faced here and she showed nothing but strength.''
</P>
<P>
   He told how his daughter became a guiding force to other kids in
the hospital. ``One girl wouldn't eat for months and pretty soon
Cody was down there with her and she was eating in 20 minutes,''
Unser said.
</P>
<P>
   When fans and race drivers _ Bobby Labonte sent $60,000 _
started to send money, Cody and Shelley set up the Cody Unser First
Step Foundation, a nonprofit fund to funnel money toward research
and awareness of all spinal cord injures.
</P>
<P>
   As part of her rehab, Cody went back to swimming, lifting
weights and riding a specially-equipped bicycle. ``She showed me
that you go after what you want,'' Unser said.
</P>
<P>
   For him, that was the Indy 500. ``After last year, I vowed I
wouldn't miss another,'' he said. ``I'm 38 years old and I'm in the
prime of my life as far as a race car driver. I'm in good physical
shape and I have experience.''
</P>
<P>
   His contract was coming to an end with Roger Penske and it was
becoming obvious it would not be renewed. As he went looking for a
new race deal, he was approached by other CART teams and some
NASCAR owners. ``I told them all my first priority was running the
Indy 500 and that pretty much ended he conversation with most of
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Rick Galles contacted him. He had been Unser's
original owner in 1983 and the two had teamed up for Al Jr.'s Indy
500 victory in 1992. They signed a five-year contract and instantly
Unser said ``I could breathe again.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was as if his whole world had gotten back in order.
``This place means so much to my family. To us, the Indy 500 is the
mother, the father and the granddaddy of all racing. It's the first
race, the oldest race and the best race.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, three races after signing on with Galles, he won the
Indy Vegas 300. Everyone _ especially friend and CART rival Michael
Andretti, who called him in Victory Lane _ was thrilled for Unser,
who has decals on his car to raise awareness of spinal cord
injuries. He dedicated the victory to his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally I could show her that if you fight and don't give up,
you can get what you want,'' he said. Then again, Cody already knew
that.
</P>
<P>
   That's why _ to insure her independence _ she's had the
handlebars cut off the back of her wheelchair. She doesn't want
anyone pushing her around. In true Unser fashion, she knows as long
as she's got a set of wheels under her, she going to be able to
move like few others.

BUSH IS COMMENCEMENT SPEAKER IN SMALL TEXAS TOWN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRAWFORD, Texas _ For the first time in history, Crawford High
School had a commencement speaker.
</P>
<P>
   His name: George W. Bush, the Texas governor who would be
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of all,'' Bush told the graduates, ``I hope that when you
look in the mirror you will always be proud of what you see.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's only other commencement address this year was at Prairie
View A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was pretty much his initiative,'' principal Don Harris
said of Bush's offer to address the tiny class of 45. ``He could
have spoken probably just about anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But this tiny community, 18 miles west of Waco, is a new second
home to Bush and will be the Texas White House if he is elected
president. The governor bought a 1,600-acre ranch west of town,
near the Middle Bosque River, last August.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 people attended the 8 p.m. event in the football
stadium. Typically, the school's graduations draw fewer than half
that number. The town only has about 700 residents scattered over
the region's fertile hills.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday night's pomp and circumstance, an ice cream social
for the whole town and one last party for the graduates, most of
them were to board a bus at 2 a.m. Saturday to move the celebration
to South Padre Island on the Texas Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   When they return Monday night, and probably for years to come,
the graduates can reminisce about the time they mingled with the
man who might be president under the glare of network television
lights. And it all transpired in a simple rural town without even a
Dairy Queen.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who frequents the ranch on weekends, already has drawn
there a few famous visitors, such as ABC-TV journalists Barbara
Walters and Sam Donaldson and a steady stream of Secret Service
agents who provide him round-the-clock protection. But Friday's
event was Bush's first major coming-out party in his new hometown.
</P>
<P>
   While campaigning, he encouraged national reporters to attend
the Crawford graduation and he invited them to the ice cream
social. Just the day before, he discouraged the media from
attending his twin daughters' graduation in Austin, saying they
didn't want special attention.
</P>
<P>
   While the Crawford community was glad that Bush joined the
festivities, Harris said, ``this is still graduation, and it's
still Crawford graduation,'' emphasizing the town's name.
</P>
<P>
   Harris expressed pride that the high school, which has about 270
students, has received ``exemplary'' ratings from the Texas
Education Agency for five straight years. In 1999, all sophomores
passed all segments of the state skills test.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being off the beaten path, Harris said, Crawford
attracts quality teachers who help inspire many students to attend
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very blessed and fortunate with a very strong
faculty,'' he said. ``Any accomplishments we have are a tribute to
them.'' The school's small size (class 2-A in sports competitions)
allows personal attention for students, said the principal, who has
been there 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 45 seniors, 20 are honor graduates and many will attend
college. The valedictorian is going to Texas A&AMP;M University and the
twin girls who ranked second and third are going to the University
of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Stacy Clark, 19, will be commuting to McLennan
Community College in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become really close,'' she said. ``Everybody knows
everything about everybody, for better or for worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, is still somewhat of an outsider, and some folks
here weren't thrilled that Friday's ceremony attracted so many
visitors who wanted to see Bush more than the graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get to invite everybody we wanted to,'' Clark said,
``but I think it's a really neat idea, because in a couple of years
I'm going to look back and say, `Wow, I shook the governor's hand,
but now he's the president!'''
</P>
<P>
   She believes Bush's moving to Crawford is sure to attract new
business and other growth.
</P>
<P>
   But there haven't been any big changes yet, said cheerleader and
senior class president Mandy Kelm, except for the excitement of
planning for the big event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to make sure that all the graduates have enough
room for all their family to come,'' she said. ``Plus, we're trying
to accommodate the community to come and watch him (Bush).''
</P>
<P>
   Headed for Texas A&AMP;M this fall, Kelm works at a local
tent-making company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my friends work in Waco because there's really nothing
in Crawford,'' she said. ``We have a gas station and a burger
joint. We have a beauty shop, but two older ladies do that. And
that's about it.''

EDITORIAL: AN ODD VETO 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, May 27:
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki is out of step with both the public and with
state lawmakers in vetoing an important bill that would require all
cigarettes sold in New York to meet new fire safety standards by
2002. Lighted cigarettes dropped on beds and couches are the
leading cause of fire-related deaths in the state, killing nearly
50 people a year. This deadly hazard can be significantly reduced
if cigarettes are designed to be self-extinguishing after a smoker
stops puffing on the cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   Both the state Assembly and Senate unanimously passed the bill,
which was supported by medical groups, firefighters' associations,
consumer advocates and anti-smoking groups. The only opponents were
tobacco companies that argued against state regulation of their
products. The bill would have directed the state Office of Fire
Prevention and Control to create fire safety standards if a federal
standard was not enacted by 2001. Tobacco companies have the
technology to meet the new standards. A few brands may meet them
already.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, at the last minute Pataki surprised the
Legislature by vetoing the bill on the grounds that it did not deal
with the potential bootlegging problem. He argues that smokers may
not like fire-safe cigarettes, and may increase demand for
illegally trafficked cigarettes that do not meet fire safety
standards. He wants the Legislature to approve a separate bill that
will increase penalties on cigarette bootleggers and curb illegal
Internet sales of cigarettes to minors.
</P>
<P>
   Those ideas deserve support, but they need not prevent enactment
of legislation that requires the industry to comply with new
fire-safe standards two years from now. The governor approved a
55-cent-per-pack increase in the state cigarette tax without
insisting on passage of anti-bootlegging measures. There is no need
now to link fire-safe cigarettes with anti-bootlegging measures,
which should be debated on their own.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, May 27:
</P>
<P>
   The abortion debate has gotten murkier in recent years as
pro-life forces have shifted their strategy. Whereas once they were
focused on wholesale repudiation of Roe vs. Wade, they are now
finding it more productive to chip away at a woman's right to
choose by imposing limitations. One result has been to blur the
meaning of ``pro-choice.''
</P>
<P>
   A good example of this confusion is the Senate race in New York
between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rep. Rick Lazio. Both call
themselves pro-choice. But they differ significantly on how far
government should go in limiting choice.
</P>
<P>
   This new fuzziness shows how successful pro-life forces have
been in limiting abortion rights one restriction at a time. Even
politicians who consider themselves pro-choice wind up siding with
pro-life groups by, for example, endorsing laws that mandate
waiting periods and parental notification. But the pro-life camp's
most important victory has been on the so-called partial birth
abortion ban.
</P>
<P>
   By seeming to target a single procedure that sounds particularly
distasteful, pro-life strategists have won support for partial
birth legislation from a broad range of politicians, including
Republicans like Gov. George Pataki of New York who are generally
pro-choice, and even pro-choice Democrats like Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan and Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   That may be because the partial birth ban is frequently
misadvertised as dealing only with a rare procedure used in
late-term abortions. In fact, the language of partial birth
legislation in Congress and in most of the statutes adopted by some
30 states is so vague that it could potentially apply even to
common procedures used before viability of the fetus. That is why
such laws have been blocked by nearly every federal and state court
that has reviewed them.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio says he is an abortion rights supporter, but he too favors
the partial birth abortion ban and has described Clinton as extreme
for opposing it. He has also voted for other restrictions, like
prohibiting women in the military from obtaining privately funded
abortions at overseas military hospitals and subjecting to criminal
prosecution anyone other than a parent who accompanies a minor
across state lines for an abortion in violation of parental consent
laws.
</P>
<P>
   The top three Republican candidates in the Senate race in New
Jersey also call themselves pro-choice though all support the
partial birth ban, a stance that allows them to reach out to
moderate voters without angering pro-life groups. This may be smart
politics. Other politicians who have refused to back the partial
birth ban have made enemies politically, among them New York's
mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, and Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Voters are going to have to be alert this year to the nuances of
the abortion issue. There are candidates out there who promise to
support a woman's right to choose, but whose commitment is
compromised by their willingness to accept more government
intrusion into private medical decisions.

DEVILS ADVANCE TO STANLEY CUP FINALS WITH 2-1 WIN OVER FLYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Devils accomplished what seemed impossible
six days ago. Friday night they made history.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey defeated the Philadelphia Flyers, 2-1, in Game 7 to
become the first team to advance to the Stanley Cup finals after
trailing a conference finals by 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Patrik Elias scored both goals for the Devils, the winner with
only 2 minutes 32 seconds remaining, to send the Devils to their
second Stanley Cup finals appearance. In 1995 they swept the
Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brodeur played a brilliant game in goal for the Devils,
making 26 saves. His only mistake was Rick Tocchet's goal that tied
the game early in the second after Elias had opened the scoring in
the first with his sixth in the playoffs against Brian Boucher, who
made 16 saves.
</P>
<P>
   It was the eighth Game 7 played by the Devils, and only their
third victory. The series seemed to turn around for the Devils
after coach Larry Robinson publicly chastised the team after their
loss in Game 4 at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The sellout crowd at First Union Center was silenced only 20
seconds after Keith Jones took the first penalty in the game, 6
minutes 24 seconds after the opening faceoff. That is how long it
took the Devils to capitalize on their man-advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Elias found himself unguarded in the slot to the left of Boucher
and had no trouble converting Jason Arnott's pass from the boards.
It was the sixth goal in the playoffs for Elias.
</P>
<P>
   A frightening moment came 66 seconds later when Eric Lindros was
leveled by Scott Stevens. The Devils' captain caught Lindros with
his head down as he entered the Devils' zone. Stevens blindsided
Lindros with a crushing check that knocked him off his skates.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros hit his head on the ice. He was attended to by the
Flyers' trainers, then helped off the ice and taken to a hospital.
Stevens was not assessed a penalty despite pleas by the Flyers'
fans, who thought Stevens had elbowed Lindros on the play.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening period, the officials awarded the Flyers three
manpower advantages, but the Devils escaped unscathed. They were so
busy defending after the goal by Elias that they went without a
shot for about 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Brylin and Alexander Mogilny had marvelous opportunities
to extend the lead early in the second period, but they fanned on
their shots from in close. Elias also had a good chance before the
period was four minutes old, but his shot sailed wide to the right.
</P>
<P>
   Colin White, the rookie defenseman of the Devils, took the
fourth penalty in the game for the Devils, and it proved costly
because the Flyers tied the game on Tocchet's fifth goal in the
playoffs. The score came on a rebound from close range with a crowd
in front of Brodeur, who had saved a weak shot from John LeClair
before Tocchet jumped on the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   The goal came 6:01 into the middle period and it fired up the
Flyers. They dominated most of the period, but failed to tally
again, thanks to Brodeur's heroics.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur's most hectic moment in the period came with three
minutes left when he made a glove save on Simon Gagne. The Flyers
took 15 shots against him.

YANKEES LOOK ORDINARY, OR WORSE, IN 4-1 LOSS TO BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Carl Everett speaks disdainfully of the Yankees,
infers they are unremarkable, a common team with lots of
championship rings.
</P>
<P>
   But Everett's description is charitable when applied to the
season's first meeting between the Yankees and Red Sox Friday
night. The Yankees played poorly and suffered the consequences,
losing by 4-1 at Yankee Stadium. Ramon Martinez began the game with
a 6.95 earned run average and allowed one run over seven and
two-thirds innings; David Cone is 1-4 after 10 starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have help on the way, for they probably will
activate shortstop Derek Jeter from the disabled list in time for
Saturday's game. Jeter went 2 for 3 in a minor league game in
Tampa, Fla., Friday night and intended to return to the New York
area on a rented jet. Since Jeter strained an muscle in his abdomen
May 11, the Yankees have lost 9 of 13 games. It is expected that
Boston shortstop Nomar Garciaparra will also be activated.
</P>
<P>
   Even if this loss had not been to the Red Sox, even if it did
not force the Yankees out of first place, it would have been one of
the more frustrating defeats. Yankees manager Joe Torre has said
many times that he does not lose sleep over one-sided losses, but
he might have gone home last night and replayed the pivotal moments
when his team gave away runs _ some of those scored by the Red Sox,
and some the Yankees should have scored.
</P>
<P>
   First inning. The Red Sox had runners at first and third and one
out, and Cone was struggling; among his many pitches, only his
split-fingered fastball had any real quality to it, and Cone tried
desperately to get the Red Sox hitters to swing at this pitch.
Brian Daubach did so, hitting a one-hopper back to Cone.
</P>
<P>
   His entire career, Cone's first instinct has been to obstruct
all baserunners at third, prevent any runs from scoring, and he
immediately ran at Jeff Frye, the Boston runner at third. What he
should have done was throw to second for what would probably have
been an easy, inning-ending double play
</P>
<P>
   But Frye got into a rundown long enough for John Valentin to
take third and Daubach to reach second. The crowd of 54,470 cheered
Cone, but he knew better, berating himself behind the mound after
the play was over; ``stupid'' was among the many words he muttered.
</P>
<P>
   No runs should have scored, but the Red Sox scored twice when
the next hitter _ Everett _ lined a single into center field.
Cone's shoulders sagged when Daubach crossed the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Cone continued to labor, walking two batters in the second
inning, hanging a slider and surrendering a two-run homer to Mike
Stanley in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed to get loose in the middle innings, his control
improving and he pinned the Red Sox to their four runs. Clay
Bellinger ripped a solo home run off Martinez in the third. The
Yankees trailed by 4-1 after three innings, but they still were in
a position to come back.
</P>
<P>
   Their opportunity came in the fifth. Chris Turner singled to
right field to lead off, before Bellinger pulled a single through
the left side of the infield. Two runners on, nobody out, top of
the order coming up.
</P>
<P>
   With Chuck Knoblauch out of the lineup with a bruised wrist,
Ricky Ledee was the lead-off hitter, and he hit a soft line drive
toward center. Everett had been positioned extremely shallow in the
first few innings, as if he were daring the Yankees to drive the
ball over his head. But he was a little farther back with the Red
Sox winning and Ledee at the plate, and he could not reach the soft
liner.
</P>
<P>
   Bellinger, running from first base, realized this immediately,
racing around second, hustling toward third, and he was more than
halfway to the bag when he saw Turner standing near the bag. A
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Frye took the throw from Everett and ran with the ball at
Bellinger, tagging him out while Ledee reached second and Turner
held third. The Yankees should've had the bases loaded and no outs,
and Wilson Delgado, Paul O'Neill and Bernie Williams due to hit.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there was one out _ and then two outs, after Delgado
popped up, some fans booing and then more booing when O'Neill
grounded out. That was their chance. That was it.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are just another team, Everett has said. Friday
night, it would have been hard to argue the point.

THOMAS TO BE STARTER IF EWING CANNOT PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE POPPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ Kurt Thomas sat on a chair at the end of the
court Friday, staring ahead, past the reporters and his teammates,
perhaps all the way to Saturday at Madison Square Garden. He may
find himself the Knicks' starting center in one of season's biggest
games. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With Patrick Ewing's availability in question, Thomas is next in
line to assume the starting spot when the Knicks, already down 2-0
in the Eastern Conference finals, play host to the Pacers in Game
3.
</P>
<P>
   The 28 minutes he logged in Ewing's absence in Game 2 were 12
more than his next highest total in the playoffs and 15 more than
he played in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I get paid to do,'' he said Friday at Purchase
College. ``I hate to see Patrick get injured, but I've just got to
go out there and play. Of course I hope he can play. We need
Patrick if we want to make some kind of run in the playoffs.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The piercing stare from the 6-foot-9-inch Thomas that may worry
some forwards will be useless against the 7-4 Rik Smits. Still,
Thomas played well against Smits when he got his chance,
contributing 10 points and eight rebounds in Game 2. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas has been foul prone and has displayed a quick temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to stay in front of him as much as possible, just try
to keep my body between him and the basket,'' Thomas said of Smits.
``He's 7-4 and he's so long. It's really hard for me to contest his
shots. Of course, he knows he can shoot over me at any opportunity.
I just have to try to get my hands in his face as much as
possible.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy added: ``It'll take guys who did not
play like they're capable to show mental toughness and bounce back.
And it's going to take us rebounding the ball and defending without
fouling.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thomas has committed 35 fouls in 156 minutes in the postseason,
recording one more foul than his rebound total. The task on the
backboards is made more difficult by the presence of Dale Davis,
who has grabbed 16 rebounds in each of the first two games. But
there is little choice for Thomas, as well as for Marcus Camby and
Chris Dudley, who will probably play more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to prepare as if he's not going to be there, but
hopefully he will be,'' Thomas said of Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I understand, if he can not play I'll be starting at
the center. I go in and whenever he calls my number, whatever he
informs me I have to do, I go with the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Missed Signal
</P>
<P>
   Chris Childs did not practice, nursing a sore right knee from
the fourth-quarter collision with Rik Smits. But that did not
excuse him from a critique by Jeff Van Gundy. With just over three
minutes remaining in Game 2, Van Gundy was signaling for Childs to
call a timeout with the Knicks holding an 80-77 lead because Childs
had been bumped to the floor by Smits on the previous sequence. But
Childs ignored the request and missed a 3-point attempt. Smits then
converted a 3-point play to tie the score. ``I was calling timeout
because he said he was hurt,'' Van Gundy said. ``Then he waved me
off and shot the 3. It was one of many bad plays in the last four
minutes by us.''
</P>
<P>
   Extra Practice
</P>
<P>
   In his first minutes of the postseason on Thursday, John Wallace
was 0 for 2 from the floor with a turnover in four minutes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remembering Sealy
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jackson, Reggie Miller, Al Harrington, Dale Davis and Chris
Mullin flew to New York on a private jet after Thursday's game to
attend the funeral for Malik Sealy friday morning. The rest of the
team flew in this morning for a late afternoon practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very tough, but at the same time, it was one in which
we celebrated his life and the way he lived it and the impact he
made,'' Jackson said. ``There were a lot of tears but also a lot of
celebrating also. My prayers continue to go out to the family.''

 DROP IN COMPONENT ORDERS A SIGNAL OF SLOWING ECONOMY?
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID LAZARUS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 2000 the San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Although sales of cell phones, Palm Pilots and
other gadgets continue to climb, factory orders of electronic goods
and components plunged by a record 20.1 percent in April, the
Commerce Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and analysts were unsure what to make of the
seemingly contradictory trends. But they agreed that a sustained
decline in electronics orders would have serious repercussions not
just for technology centers like Silicon Valley but for the economy
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silicon Valley has been the leading edge of the economy,''
said Michael Lehmann, a professor of economics at the University of
San Francisco. ``When it heads south, it's going to pull all the
wagons with it.''
</P>
<P>
   He was quick to caution that a single month's statistics do not
represent a trend and that April's decline in electronics orders
may be no more than a blip on the radar.
</P>
<P>
   But Lehmann said the unusually steep drop suggests that the
health of America's fastest-growing industry has taken a turn for
the worse, which does not bode well for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in electronics orders contributed to a 6.4 percent
drop in overall factory orders for big-ticket durable goods, the
sharpest such downturn in nearly nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're in for a recession,'' Lehmann said. ``This
number could be the opening round.''
</P>
<P>
   But others insist that the long-term trend for electronics
orders remains one of growth. In March, orders for electronics and
electrical equipment, including semiconductors, circuit boards and
home appliances, rose 8.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   `Best of Times'
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the best of times,'' said David Levine, a professor
of economics at the University of California at Berkeley's Haas
School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Joseph Byrne, a technology analyst at the Gartner Group's
Dataquest research unit, noted that the record size of April's drop
in electronics orders merits closer scrutiny under any
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you see orders fall by 20 percent, you ought to pay
attention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne was left scratching his head by the Commerce Department's
implication that demand is down for electronic gadgets and
components.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our working assumption has been that supply was straining to
keep up with demand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this is the most puzzling aspect of the department's
findings. A 20 percent drop in factory orders of chips and other
tech tidbits should mean that manufacturers of electronic goods are
tightening their belts.
</P>
<P>
   But sales of personal computers expanded 20 percent in the first
quarter, according to International Data Corp., and a number of
electronics companies have said recently that production is being
slowed by a shortage of chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a problem all right,'' said Kurt King, an analyst with
Banc of America Securities. ``But it's supply, not demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo Co., said this week that it will postpone the debut of
a more powerful, highly anticipated Game Boy player in the United
States until next March because it cannot find enough chips and
screens.
</P>
<P>
   Factories in Full Throttle
</P>
<P>
   Chip factories in Taiwan, South Korea and elsewhere are working
full throttle to keep up with demand. But analysts say there just
are not enough plants to provide semiconductors for all of today's
increasingly ``smart'' devices.
</P>
<P>
   For example, about 435 million cellular phones are expected to
be shipped this year, surging to more than 900 million by 2003,
according to Forward Concepts, a semiconductor market researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these phones will be competing for scant supplies of
chips and displays with Palm Pilots, Game Boys and other handheld
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara, Calif.'s Intel Corp. this week said that to meet
growing demand it will invest $2 billion to expand chip production
in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the semiconductor industry as a whole underinvested in
1998 and 1999,'' Intel's chief executive, Craig Barrett, said.
``I'd expect some shortages of components for the next 12 months or
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary Findings
</P>
<P>
   Gary Schlossberg, an economist at Wells Capital Management in
San Francisco, noted that the Commerce Department's findings are
still only preliminary, and said the picture may become clearer
when more concrete numbers are released next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there must be something dragging that statistic down,'' he
admitted. ``Maybe the government is only looking at certain types
of chips.''
</P>
<P>
   From a broader view, Schlossberg said the 6.4 percent drop in
total factory orders indicates that a series of increases in
short-term interest rates over the past year finally may be
accomplishing the Federal Reserve's goal of slowing economic growth
and keeping inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, nearly all economic indicators pointed toward
continued expansion. In March, for example, factory orders for
durable goods climbed 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said in a separate report
yesterday that Americans' incomes in April rose at a faster pace
than spending for a second straight month, indicating that
consumers are growing reluctant to shell out for cars,
refrigerators and other heavy-duty purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Schlossberg said it will take considerably more
evidence of an economic slowdown for the Fed to call a halt to
raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   He said another quarter-point increase is likely in coming
months.

EDITORIAL: SERBIA'S MUZZLED MEDIA 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, May 27:
</P>
<P>
   When masked police staged a 2 a.m. raid on Serbia's most
important opposition television and radio stations last week, it
signaled an escalation of Slobodan Milosevic's attacks on the
media. Independent journalists throughout Serbia have been beaten
and arrested, and their transmitters are mysteriously failing.
Milosevic is apparently desperate to control the news as elections
approach, which makes it particularly important for friends of
democracy in Serbia to help these broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic previously attacked the independent media mainly by
yanking their licenses, suing them and imposing steep fines. A
small group of radio and television stations managed to broadcast
anyway. The most important are Studio B, controlled by Vuk
Draskovic, an opposition leader whose party runs Belgrade, and
Radio B2-92. Both were closed last week.
</P>
<P>
   The raids are the culmination of an increasingly desperate
campaign to label independent journalists as terrorists and to
paint them as shills for the NATO alliance. The Serbian government
is also threatening to pass a new anti-terrorism law, which would
certainly be used against these journalists.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for Milosevic's panic is that polls show his support
dropping, and the Constitution provides for local and parliamentary
elections by the end of the year. His political opposition is
hapless, divided and easily manipulated, and has responded to the
media crackdown with silence and confusion. But a new student
movement, called Otpor, is drawing substantial public support.
</P>
<P>
   The independent media can reach much of their public with help
from outside. Serbia's sister republic, Montenegro, which is in
open rebellion against Milosevic, has offered its satellite
stations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when B2-92's predecessor was briefly closed, the Voice
of America broadcast its news programs. The VOA, BBC and other
foreign stations can be heard on FM radio in Serbia. Their
transmitters could allow B2-92's news to reach a large audience.
Western governments and news outlets are also increasing aid to
Serbia's independent journalists. A new fund for the legal defense
of persecuted journalists will be particularly important as
Milosevic intensifies his campaign.

 GHIRARDELLI SMELLS SWEET SUCCESS  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The first thing you notice is the smell _ a
sweet, fudgey scent that permeates the neighborhood and suggests
what it must have been like, 150 years ago, when Domingo
Ghirardelli was cooking up his confections for pioneers and miners
and San Francisco society folk.
</P>
<P>
   Those confections have changed little over the decades _ the
recipes remain a closely guarded secret _ but the
multimillion-dollar company that Ghirardelli founded has
experienced considerable growing pains and is only now looking to
extend its famous brand to international markets.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Ghirardelli is known to most people overseas only
as that really good chocolate made in that fun factory near
Fisherman's Wharf.
</P>
<P>
   What they tend not to realize is that Ghirardelli Chocolate Co.,
America's oldest continuous chocolate-maker, vacated its red-brick
factory in San Francisco 35 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The tourists who visit the Ghirardelli Chocolate Manufactury in
Ghirardelli Square are seeing only relics of an earlier day. No
chocolate is manufactured at the manufactury.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the company occupies an unexceptional,
265,000-square-foot plant in an industrial section of San Leandro,
where a $45 million expansion project will conclude next month,
quadrupling production capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion marks yet another turning point for Ghirardelli,
which, in its long history, has been owned at various times by the
maker of Rice-a-Roni and the company behind Cap'n Crunch cereal.
</P>
<P>
   Privately held Ghirardelli was purchased in 1998 for an
undisclosed amount by Swiss chocolate giant Lindt &AMP; Sprungli.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Anton, Ghirardelli's chief executive since 1992, said he
had agonized about selling off the company. Sitting in the
company's shiny new boardroom beneath a large, grim-looking
portrait of the founder, Anton said his original plan to raise
much-needed capital for growth had been to take Ghirardelli public.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with Lindt, here was a company whose total focus was
chocolate,'' he said. ``The more I thought about that, the more
excited I got.''
</P>
<P>
   Anton's excitement was quickly justified as Lindt steered
Ghirardelli toward investing millions of dollars in new equipment
for producing filled chocolates _ bars and squares crammed with
caramel, orange and mint fillings, and, not coincidentally, the
kind of treats that Lindt itself specializes in.
</P>
<P>
   Making such things is a lot harder than you might imagine, and
Anton, who has worked in the food industry almost his entire
career, is more than happy to detail every intricate step of the
process.
</P>
<P>
   The filled chocolates premiered on store shelves last month, and
Anton has high hopes that they will be a strong addition to a
product line that already brings in about $160 million in annual
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Along with chocolate bars and squares, Ghirardelli produces
fancier chocolates for special occasions, chips and bars for
baking, hot chocolate mix, cocoa, flavored coffees and even the
chocolate powder sprinkled on cappuccinos.
</P>
<P>
   The company has about 20 retail outlets nationwide and is hoping
to soon penetrate Japan and other Asian markets. Anton said total
sales are growing by 20 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the right place at the right time,'' he explained.
``The Baby Boomers are of an age where they can be more discerning,
which means they go for premium chocolates.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's a good time to be a Ghirardelli or a Godiva
and not the most opportune moment for a Hershey or Mars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've waited more than 145 years for this to happen,'' Anton
said. ``But it's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Americans are suddenly turning up their noses at Milky
Way bars and Baby Ruths. According to the Chocolate Manufacturers
Association, an industry group, the typical American consumes about
12 pounds of chocolate a year, mostly the sort that comes tumbling
out of vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover:
</P>
<P>
   -- Americans spend $1 billion each Valentine's Day on candy.
</P>
<P>
   -- The country's retail chocolate business is worth $13 billion
a year.
</P>
<P>
   -- Chocolate manufacturers use 40 percent of the world's
almonds, 20 percent of the world's peanuts and 8 percent of the
world's sugar.
</P>
<P>
   -- Nougat, the gooey substance inside many chocolate bars, is
made from almonds, pistachios and other nuts, stirred into a sugar
paste.
</P>
<P>
   -- Science has yet to prove conclusively that chocolate is an
aphrodisiac.
</P>
<P>
   ``But chocolate is still sensual because of the way it melts in
your mouth,'' insisted Susan Smith, a spokeswoman for the
association.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that, contrary to widely held beliefs, there's no
scientific connection between chocolate and migraine headaches or
acne.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the myths that people think about chocolate just
aren't true,'' Smith said. ``People think that if something tastes
good, there must be something wrong with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of U.S. candy companies make their own chocolate.
Because the process is so complex, most candy companies buy their
chocolate in bulk from a manufacturer and then melt it into desired
shapes and sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Ghirardelli is one of the few to handle everything itself. To
emphasize the point, Anton donned a white lab coat and hair net,
removed his watch (``If the crystal broke, it could fall into a
vat'') and led the way onto the factory floor.
</P>
<P>
   The smell is intense, almost intoxicating, as if the world's
biggest batch of brownies had just been removed from the oven.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most Ghirardelli workers say they don't even notice. ``You
just stop smelling it after a while,'' said Azara Edwards, who runs
the machines that each day churn out thousands of chocolate chips
for cookies. ``It's a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Anton agreed. ``I have to be away for a while before I notice it
again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He led the way through the warehouse, where about 9 million
pounds of finished chocolate is stored, to a pile of 140-pound
sacks of cocoa beans from Africa, South America and Indonesia.
Anton explained how the trick to really good chocolate is to remove
the shell and get at the center part, called the nib.
</P>
<P>
   The nib is the primary source of what the chocolate industry
euphemistically calls cocoa butter, but which is in reality cocoa
fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fat carries all the flavor,'' Anton said.
</P>
<P>
   After the beans are processed, they are converted to flakes and
then liquid form, and mixed with sugar and lecithin. The resulting
chocolate is pumped to various machines throughout the plant via
overhead pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the production is automated, and Anton said each machine
is custom-made in Europe and costs many millions of dollars.
Because Ghirardelli has been around for so long, though, the
factory contains a mix of old and new equipment, with some
requiring tender loving care from workers and others humming along
under the control of computers.
</P>
<P>
   Do workers sample the merchandise as it comes off the line?
Anton said it's not company policy, but a good deal of tasting
might fall under the heading of ``quality control.''
</P>
<P>
   Factory employees smile when asked how active they are in
quality control. ``Look at my hips,'' said Yolanda Caro as she
monitored endless rows of chocolate chips traveling along a
conveyor belt.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing his tour of the plant, Anton plucked off his hair net
and recalled how he once worked for a company that made soy
proteins for food products.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd talk about it at a cocktail party, and people would be
snoring on me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't happen anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I talk about chocolate,'' Anton said, ``and people light
up. They ask if I have any samples. How's that for a good job?''

KOBE GETS PIPPEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Psychological warfare didn't work, so Phil
Jackson took a different approach to stopping his onetime protege,
Scottie Pippen, in Game 3 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' coach used the best weapon he had left: Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson switched defensive assignments, placing Bryant -- the
Lakers' best open-court defender -- on Pippen, the Portland Trail
Blazers' best and most creative open-court player, to start the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant opened this series guarding Damon Stoudamire, but Pippen
forced the issue by punishing the Lakers with 21 points and 11
rebounds in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   It was a matchup Bryant relished. He went out of his way to ask
for the assignment last year in the playoffs, when Pippen was
playing for the Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Bryant) didn't say anything to me about it,'' Jackson
said. ``He wanted to play him at the start of this series.''
</P>
<P>
   With Pippen acting in the role of point guard at times in Game
2, Jackson said the move was designed ``to try and stem their
attack early on. And Scottie's represented that for them. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Kobe's a guy who moves his feet the best from the starting
crew out there, so we picked him to go against Damon, because we
anticipated that frontal attack that they give you through him is
the one that could hurt us potentially the most, and has during the
course of the season in the opening parts of the game. But that's
been pretty limited by Damon's inability to play him the last game
through the fouls.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy produced mixed results. Pippen scored just four
points in the first half, while Stoudamire, working initially
against Ron Harper, scored nine points in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Good gauge: Jackson didn't even try to downplay the magnitude of
this weekend's two-game set in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a critical point of our year,'' he said. ``You
know, find out how well we're going to do when odds are against us,
chips are down and we've got to come back from a disappointing
loss. How we right ourselves. This is a real important weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My message to them is that we gave (the Blazers) a lot of
momentum coming out of Game 2 and it depends upon how quickly we
find a way to stem that momentum is how quickly we get back in this
series again and carry that home-court advantage again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Rookie swingman Devean George was diagnosed with a
severely sprained left ankle and did not make the trip, leaving the
Lakers with only 11 players in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   George, who injured himself in practice Thursday, will not join
the team this weekend. He is scheduled to visit team orthopedist
Dr. Stephen Lombardo early next week.

 DROP IN COMPONENT ORDERS A SIGNAL OF SLOWING ECONOMY?
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID LAZARUS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 2000 the San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Although sales of cell phones, Palm Pilots and
other gadgets continue to climb, factory orders of electronic goods
and components plunged by a record 20.1 percent in April, the
Commerce Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and analysts were unsure what to make of the
seemingly contradictory trends. But they agreed that a sustained
decline in electronics orders would have serious repercussions not
just for technology centers like Silicon Valley but for the economy
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silicon Valley has been the leading edge of the economy,''
said Michael Lehmann, a professor of economics at the University of
San Francisco. ``When it heads south, it's going to pull all the
wagons with it.''
</P>
<P>
   He was quick to caution that a single month's statistics do not
represent a trend and that April's decline in electronics orders
may be no more than a blip on the radar.
</P>
<P>
   But Lehmann said the unusually steep drop suggests that the
health of America's fastest-growing industry has taken a turn for
the worse, which does not bode well for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in electronics orders contributed to a 6.4 percent
drop in overall factory orders for big-ticket durable goods, the
sharpest such downturn in nearly nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're in for a recession,'' Lehmann said. ``This
number could be the opening round.''
</P>
<P>
   But others insist that the long-term trend for electronics
orders remains one of growth. In March, orders for electronics and
electrical equipment, including semiconductors, circuit boards and
home appliances, rose 8.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   `Best of Times'
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the best of times,'' said David Levine, a professor
of economics at the University of California at Berkeley's Haas
School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Joseph Byrne, a technology analyst at the Gartner Group's
Dataquest research unit, noted that the record size of April's drop
in electronics orders merits closer scrutiny under any
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you see orders fall by 20 percent, you ought to pay
attention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne was left scratching his head by the Commerce Department's
implication that demand is down for electronic gadgets and
components.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our working assumption has been that supply was straining to
keep up with demand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this is the most puzzling aspect of the department's
findings. A 20 percent drop in factory orders of chips and other
tech tidbits should mean that manufacturers of electronic goods are
tightening their belts.
</P>
<P>
   But sales of personal computers expanded 20 percent in the first
quarter, according to International Data Corp., and a number of
electronics companies have said recently that production is being
slowed by a shortage of chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a problem all right,'' said Kurt King, an analyst with
Banc of America Securities. ``But it's supply, not demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo Co., said this week that it will postpone the debut of
a more powerful, highly anticipated Game Boy player in the United
States until next March because it cannot find enough chips and
screens.
</P>
<P>
   Factories in Full Throttle
</P>
<P>
   Chip factories in Taiwan, South Korea and elsewhere are working
full throttle to keep up with demand. But analysts say there just
are not enough plants to provide semiconductors for all of today's
increasingly ``smart'' devices.
</P>
<P>
   For example, about 435 million cellular phones are expected to
be shipped this year, surging to more than 900 million by 2003,
according to Forward Concepts, a semiconductor market researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these phones will be competing for scant supplies of
chips and displays with Palm Pilots, Game Boys and other handheld
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara, Calif.'s Intel Corp. this week said that to meet
growing demand it will invest $2 billion to expand chip production
in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the semiconductor industry as a whole underinvested in
1998 and 1999,'' Intel's chief executive, Craig Barrett, said.
``I'd expect some shortages of components for the next 12 months or
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary Findings
</P>
<P>
   Gary Schlossberg, an economist at Wells Capital Management in
San Francisco, noted that the Commerce Department's findings are
still only preliminary, and said the picture may become clearer
when more concrete numbers are released next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there must be something dragging that statistic down,'' he
admitted. ``Maybe the government is only looking at certain types
of chips.''
</P>
<P>
   From a broader view, Schlossberg said the 6.4 percent drop in
total factory orders indicates that a series of increases in
short-term interest rates over the past year finally may be
accomplishing the Federal Reserve's goal of slowing economic growth
and keeping inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, nearly all economic indicators pointed toward
continued expansion. In March, for example, factory orders for
durable goods climbed 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said in a separate report
yesterday that Americans' incomes in April rose at a faster pace
than spending for a second straight month, indicating that
consumers are growing reluctant to shell out for cars,
refrigerators and other heavy-duty purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Schlossberg said it will take considerably more
evidence of an economic slowdown for the Fed to call a halt to
raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   He said another quarter-point increase is likely in coming
months.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two men with criminal histories, one of whom, the
police said, staged five terrifying gunpoint robberies at fast-food
outlets in New York last year, were arrested Friday as suspects in
the execution-style shootings of seven bound-and-gagged workers at
a Wendy's restaurant in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 48 hours after the grisly massacre in Wendy's basement
walk-in refrigerator, in which five victims were slain with bullets
to the head and two were shot in the head and left for dead, police
seized John B. Taylor, 36, outside his mother's house in Brentwood,
in Suffolk County. They said he had once worked at several
fast-food restaurants in New York City, including the Wendy's where
the massacre occurred.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, detectives in Queens said they had taken
into custody a second man, Craig Godineaux, 30. Little was known
about him, but the authorities said he had a record of at least two
previous robberies.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what led the authorities to the
suspects, but the case against them appeared to be strong.
Detectives said Taylor and Godineaux made statements implicating
each other in the crimes. Each acknowledged that they had robbed
the Wendy's restaurant, but Taylor said that Godineaux had shot the
employees and Godineaux said that Taylor had done the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Taylor had a .380 caliber pistol _ the same
caliber as the gun used in the shootings _ in a belt pack when he
was seized. The weapon was turned over to the Police Department
laboratory for ballistics tests to determine if it was the gun used
in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   After arresting Taylor, investigators began searching his
mother's house and said they hoped to find other evidence,
including cash stolen from Wendy's and a videotape that had
apparently been taken by the assailants from the restaurant's
surveillance camera at the time of the killings. The videotape may
have caught the assailants in action.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the investigators said they had found Taylor's palm
print on a box in the blood-spattered refrigerator, and they said
he had been identified by a witness as one of two men who had
emerged from the Wendy's, on Main Street in Flushing, about 11:45
p.m. Wednesday, minutes after the killings.
</P>
<P>
   About $2,000 was taken from an office in the basement, officials
said, and the shootings _ which stunned the city and even some
law-enforcement officials with their brutality _ were apparently
carried out to eliminate witnesses to the robbery, some of whom
might have recognized one of the assailants.
</P>
<P>
   Charges were not immediately filed in the killings, and police
said it was unclear whether one or two men had fired the shots in
what appeared to be an inside job, with the assailants aware of the
Wendy's operations and layout and the manager's name, which they
invoked in a ruse to get in at closing time.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Taylor, a short, stout man, was being held Friday night on an
outstanding warrant from last year, in which he jumped bail in a
robbery case. He was said to have worked at several New York
fast-food outlets in recent years, including a McDonald's in
Manhattan that he was arrested for burglarizing in 1996, and as
recently as last fall at the Wendy's in Flushing.
</P>
<P>
   The swift arrests came as more than 100 detectives worked around
the clock in pursuit of numerous leads in a case that had drawn
expressions of shock from city officials, prosecutors, police
officials, employees of fast-food outlets and ordinary New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy's and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, in addition to announcing
rewards totaling $60,000 for information leading to the arrest and
conviction of the assailants, said that a relief fund had been
established to aid the families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people crowded the sidewalk outside the scene of the
massacre Friday as a makeshift memorial of flowers, lighted candles
and written prayers grew against the wall of the restaurant.
Passersby stopped to pray and some spoke of their sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad,'' Rinkel Bhasin, 23, said after slipping behind a
police barricade to add her bouquet of white daisies to the
memorial. She said she had often patronized the Wendy's.
</P>
<P>
   One of the two survivors, Jaquione Johnson, 18, who lives with
an aunt in Jamaica, Queens, underwent six hours of surgery Friday
for his head wound and remained in critical condition in an
intensive care unit of the New York Hospital Medical Center of
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The second survivor, Patrick Castro, 22 _ who had been shot
through both cheeks, played dead until the assailants departed,
then wriggled free of the duct tape bindings and summoned help with
a call to 911 _ was released from the same hospital late Thursday
and was under police protection.
</P>
<P>
   Five families, meantime, were making arrangements for funerals.
Those killed were Anita C. Smith, 22, of South Jamaica; Ramon
Nazario, 44, of Flushing; Jeremy Mele, 18, of Neptune, N.J.; Ali
Ibadat, 40, of Ridgewood, Queens, and Jean Dumel Auguste, 27, the
Wendy's night manager, who lived in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   While little was known of Godineaux Friday night, Taylor was
described by acquaintances as the father of two sons and a
daughter, who had lived with his children in an apartment in Lefrak
City, in Elmhurst, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very secretive guy,'' said George Gross, an
across-the-hall neighbor who said he also did Taylor's tax returns
over the past decade. ``He never opened up to anybody.'' He said
Taylor often dressed in a suit and tie, even when he worked in
fast-food outlets or as a maintenance man for a Caldor's store.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials said that in 1996 Taylor had worked as
an assistant manager at two McDonald's restaurants in Manhattan,
one at 341 Fifth Ave., and the other at 22 E. 42nd St. On June 26,
1996, the officials said, Taylor and a second man were discovered
in an attempted burglary at the Fifth Avenue place at 6 a.m., by
several employees just arriving for work.
</P>
<P>
   The two men fled, but Taylor was recognized, and police arrested
him a day later at the 42nd Street McDonald's. On July 12, he
pleaded guilty to third degree robbery. While prosecutors requested
a six-month jail term, Taylor, as a first offender, was sentenced
to five years of probation.
</P>
<P>
   Former co-workers at the Fifth Avenue restaurant said Taylor was
involved in several scams, including stealing receipts and placing
ghost workers on the payroll and taking their pay for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said that Taylor robbed or tried to
rob at least five fast-food restaurants in Queens last year, all
within an eight-day period in June.

COLOMBIAN DRIVER IS FAST TO TOSS TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
  By LIZ ROBBINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Juan Montoya was like that smart-aleck student in
the classroom with the smirk on his face one recent night,
listening to veteran reporters regale him with tales of past
Indianapolis 500 races.
</P>
<P>
   Being a first-timer here, Montoya, a 24-year-old from Colombia,
seemed at times intrigued, at other times bored and bemused. He
traded his own stories, peppering them with his signature devilish
grin and language to match.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya said he knew about the race from his fellow Colombian
Roberto Guerrero, a 15-time starter. But Indy does not awe Montoya,
nor does his irreverence concern him.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Americans, this place is heaven,'' Montoya said of the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Then he rolled his eyes, adding, ``There's too much tradition
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Montoya dismisses tradition as quickly as he does competition.
For him, the Brickyard is just a track he has yet to conquer. Told
to prepare for the sight of 400,000 roaring fans in Sunday's race,
Montoya said he was excited. ``A victory in the 500 is pretty
important,'' he said. ``I know I can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He proved that last season as a rookie driving in the
Championship Auto Racing Teams series when he won a record seven
races and seven poles en route to the title, racing for Chip
Ganassi.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a feud dividing open-wheel racing, though, Montoya
was not at Indy last year, aside from taking a tour bus around the
track. CART teams have not raced in the Indy 500 since the
speedway's president, Tony George, formed his own Indy Racing
League in 1996 and made Indy its cornerstone. In the previous
years, CART scheduled opposing races on Memorial Day weekend.
Though the impasse continues, Ganassi became the first CART team to
cross the phantom picket line here, seizing the opportunity when
CART originally kept this weekend open.
</P>
<P>
   Ganassi, whose team has won the last four CART titles, used his
crowns to bulldoze his sponsors with the news that he was going to
return here after a five-year absence. They were enthusiastic, as
were his drivers, Montoya and the 1996 CART winner, Jimmy Vasser.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to do the Indy 500; I've missed it,'' said
Vasser, making his fifth Indy start. ``Winning this would certainly
rank right at the top with winning the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Having Vasser and Montoya at Indy has re-energized, if not
validated, the quality of the field that has been hurt from the
split the past five years. ``I'm glad to see Chip and his guys
here,'' owner A.J. Foyt said. ``Now people can't say the best
aren't here anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be significant enough if Ganassi were only in Indy. But
on Saturday, his two drivers will also be in Nazareth, Pa., running
the 225-mile CART race rescheduled from April 23 because of snow.
Montoya is on the pole at Nazareth, and is starting second at Indy,
beat out by the defending I.R.L. champion, Greg Ray, by a tenth of
a second.
</P>
<P>
   To pull off the double, Ganassi flew his drivers on his Lear jet
into Nazareth Friday night, rented an equipment van, a DC-9 charter
plane for the pit crew and sponsors and had four race cars with two
different setups to accommodate each series' rules. The venture
reportedly cost him from $1.7 million to $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always sit there and figure out a way to do it; that's
what racers are all about,'' Ganassi said.
</P>
<P>
   Rain is possible for both events, and Nazareth's rain date is
Monday, the same as Indy's. Ganassi said he would worry about that
later.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya seemed unfazed by the commute. ``I'll come back and get
something to eat, get a good sleep,'' he said. ``I'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   He is attempting to become the first Indy rookie since 1966 to
win here, a challenge because, not counting Vasser, he knows little
about the 31 other drivers. ``It's a bit of a disadvantage, but you
still have to be aggressive,'' Montoya said.
</P>
<P>
   The IRL drivers know that that is his reputation. Two-time Indy
champion Al Unser Jr., who signed with IRL in order to return here,
had a warning for Montoya this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important is the Indianapolis 500 is the father, mother
and granddad of all races,'' Unser said. ``He's aggressive, but
he'd better respect Indianapolis. Indianapolis will hit you hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Montoya has shown in practice, at least, that he can dominate,
even if he hates that his required IRL engine has less power than
the one for CART. Within two days, Montoya was the fastest in
practice, and on Thursday, the last day of practice, he also
recorded the top speed.
</P>
<P>
   At 218.257 mph, Montoya could not admire the view. &QL;

EDITORIAL: DOUBLE-DECKER MENACE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, May 27:
</P>
<P>
   Randolph Walker, a 71-year-old actor, had the right of way on
Monday afternoon when a large red New York Apple Tours bus ran him
over at a corner crosswalk.
</P>
<P>
   The bus driver did not have a proper license. The bus was not
supposed to be turning onto a side street. The tour company that
owns the bus has been issued 1,800 summonses for traffic
violations, many for reckless driving. The buses, imported from
Britain, have had trouble meeting national safety and environmental
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Given this appalling record, the question is why it has taken
the death of an innocent person to finally persuade New York City
to ask an administrative law judge for an immediate suspension of
the company's license.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood activists in the areas near Broadway and Times
Square have been protesting these oversized vehicles since they
first appeared almost eight years ago. The main complaints have
been that the buses pollute the air when they are idling, then
threaten life and limb when they hurtle down side streets.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents suspect the city has ignored their complaints
because it is more interested in promoting tourism. They have a
point, especially when the same city administration has cracked
down on drunken drivers, motorists blocking traffic, speeding taxis
and wayward pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   Walker's death should have given this problem more urgency, but
an administrative law judge for the Department of Consumer Affairs
delayed even a temporary suspension of the company's license Friday
until after the Memorial Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, protesters have been trying to scare bewildered
tourists away from the Apple Tour bus loading areas, and city and
state officials are dickering about who has authority to suspend
quickly any operation with this many bad marks against it.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility that should be examined is revoking the
Department of Transportation license that allows buses to pick up
and discharge passengers. That license can be revoked for chronic
violation of traffic rules, which is certainly the case here. State
agencies that control licensing, insurance and emissions standards
should also be working to make certain vehicles are not operated in
an unsafe manner.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, these big red machines should not be out there on the
city streets. Though they delight sightseers who ride them, they
menace those on the ground.

METS WALK TO 5-2 VICTORY OVER CARDINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Despite a few standout individual performances, the
New York Mets have been a mediocre offensive team. Coming into
Friday night's game against the St. Louis Cardinals, they ranked
12th out of 16 National League clubs in runs scored and batting
average, 11th in homers and 10th in hits.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets know how to walk, just as they did last year. They
ranked second in the league in walks, and they drew nine Friday
night. The Mets strolled away with a 5-2 victory, the fourth in a
row for the starter Mike Hampton, who also contributed with his
bat, as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton (6-4) went eight innings, allowing two runs on nine hits
and two walks, lowering his earned-run average to 3.99. He also had
two singles and a sacrifice fly, improving his batting average to
.296.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied, 2-2, in the seventh inning, Cardinals
reliever Mark Thompson walked Derek Bell, Edgardo Alfonzo and Mike
Piazza with two outs. That brought up Robin Ventura, who singled to
right off left-hander Mike Mohler, scoring two runs. Ventura is now
batting .364 in his career with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   That was the second Mets rally aided by three two-out walks.
With two outs in the first, Alfonzo doubled off the wall in
left-center. Cardinals starter Pat Hentgen threw 12 balls and a
strike to the next three hitters _ Piazza, Ventura and Todd Zeile _
and the walks forced in Alfonzo with the game's first run. But
Benny Agbayani struck out looking, leaving the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Four batters into the Cardinals' first, the bases were loaded
again in similar fashion. Edgar Renteria doubled down the
left-field line, and consecutive walks by Hampton loaded the bases.
It was a good time for Hampton to be wild _ he walked the most
dangerous Cardinals, Jim Edmonds and Mark McGwire _ but it brought
up Eric Davis, who had six hits in 10 career at-bats off Hampton
coming into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's ability to induce ground balls makes him less
concerned about walks, and he showed why against Davis. Davis
grounded to shortstop Rey Ordonez, who started an inning-ending
double play.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals loaded the bases again in the second inning, on
three two-out singles, but again Hampton escaped trouble, getting
Edgar Renteria to strike out on a checked swing.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets (26-22) were having little luck against Hentgen _
besides a single Hampton chopped over the infield in the second _
but they manufactured a run in an unusual way in the fourth.
Agbayani grounded a single to right to lead off the inning, then
stole second when Hentgen threw Ordonez a curveball.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton was on deck, and his average was more than .100 better
than Ordonez's. So instead of having Ordonez swing away, Manager
Bobby Valentine called for a sacrifice bunt, which Ordonez
executed. Hampton then came up and delivered the sacrifice fly to
left, giving the Mets a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals (28-19) got a run back on a ground out in the
fourth, then tied the score in the fifth when Jim Edmonds led off
with a mammoth home run to right center, his 16th of a blistering
season that recently earned him a six-year contract extension worth
nearly $10 million a season.
</P>
<P>
   Joe McEwing made his first appearance at Busch Stadium since the
Cardinals traded him in spring training. He was sought before the
game by round after round of Cardinals employees, greeting each
warmly. A sign above the last row of seats read, ``We Miss U Joe,''
and the bidding started at $75 for an autographed McEwing photo at
a Cardinals auction.
</P>
<P>
   McEwing received a prolonged ovation as he came to bat to lead
off the game. The crowd's cheering droned out his name as it was
announced, and many fans stood in recognition of his strong '99
season, when he impressed fans and teammates with his hustle.
</P>
<P>
   McEwing's attitude has endeared himself to the Mets. ``His
approach is refreshing in that he's always into it,'' Valentine
said. ``He seems to be always enjoying it.'' But McEwing has not
hit much as a Met. He went 3 for 4 with a home run last Sunday, but
just 4 for 29 in all other games before Friday night.

3 MEXICAN CANDIDATES CLASH IN HIGH-STAKES DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The three leading presidential candidates clashed
in a harsh nationally televised debate Friday night that all three
acknowledged was crucial to their chances in the July 2 balloting.
</P>
<P>
   The encounter came after a week of unusual on-camera
confrontations between the candidates as they struggled to decide
whether to hold the debate at all. By midweek, when they finally
agreed on the debate Friday night, it had become the focal point of
the race and had proved that television was wielding new power in
the quickly changing and highly competitive campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes were highest for Vicente Fox Quesada, the strongest
opposition candidate, who faced off for 90 minutes with Francisco
Labastida Ochoa, the ruling party candidate, and Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas Solorzano, a leftist contender who has been running far
behind the other two. Earlier this week Fox dismayed voters with a
show of pique aired on live television during a meeting with his
rivals, knocking momentum from his own campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of his campaign feared that if Fox failed to repair
his image in the debate, he could never recover the lead he held
briefly earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Fox opened by attempting to explain the intransigence he
demonstrated before the videocameras on Tuesday, when he tried to
force the other two candidates to hold the debate that same night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people thought I was a little stubborn,'' Fox said.
``Even my mother said that. But it takes character and firmness to
put an end to 70 years of corruption and poverty,'' he said,
referring to the seven decades that Labastida's Institutional
Revolutionary Party has held presidential power.
</P>
<P>
   Fox came on with a battery of positive proposals to support
small business, create equal opportunities for women and improve
education. He tried to stay away from the blunt, cowboy-style
insults to Labastida that marked a first debate on April 25, which
included all six presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida sought to stay away from negative attacks and stressed
that he represents ``change with certainty, no going back, no leaps
into the void.''
</P>
<P>
   A surprisingly aggressive tack was taken by Cardenas, who is
running for president for the third time. Cardenas kept swinging at
both of his rivals throughout the debate, although he targeted his
most sustained criticism at Labastida and the PRI government.
</P>
<P>
   He accused Labastida and President Ernesto Zedillo of managing
the economy ``only to seek personal profit.'' He came down hard
against an $80 billion bank bailout that he said was the product of
a corrupt alliance between Fox's National Action Party and the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   After Cardenas and Labastida allied against Fox earlier in the
week to agree to hold the debate on Friday night, many Mexicans had
the impression that the two were somehow allied. Cardenas went out
of his way to dispel that notion.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll commissioned by The Dallas Morning News that was
published Friday, Labastida and Fox are tied at 33 percent and
Cardenas has 19 points, a nine-point surge over where he stood as
recently as two weeks ago.

TRIPLETS _ Doctors deliver triplets too early, resulting in more
health problems for babies and higher hospital bills, according to
a new report by the Valley's premier multiple-births specialist.
Mothers of triplets are pleading with doctors to deliver them at 30
or 31 weeks because they are getting so large and are in such
discomfort, Dr. John Elliott told the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists this week. Story will move in the
``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
HOUSING _ Builders around Arizona are still building apartments
that are not accessible for the disabled despite requirements that
have been around for a decade, Attorney General Janet Napolitano
said Friday. Napolitano has slapped 21 new or nearly new apartment
and condominium complexes around the state with ``administrative
charges'' for such problems as ramps that are too steep for
wheelchairs to climb or doorways too narrow to pass through. Story
will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SYMINGTON _ A one-time union pension funds attorney testified
Friday that the unions considered backing out of a $10 million loan
for Fife Symngton, but gave it to the former Arizona governor
anyway because Symington's financial statement showed he was flush.
