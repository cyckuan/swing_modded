<P>
   But there were plenty of other successes. The summer will set a
record with as many as a dozen movies topping $100 million,
obliterating the previous mark of nine in each of the past three
summers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really interesting that we saw 10 different films at No.
1 in 10 weeks because it showed an extremely competitive market,''
Dergarabedian said. ``We're seeing huge competition in holdover
films and that shows the audience is expanding. It's not a finite
pie; the slices are a little bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of pie, ``American Pie'' would have been the summer's
biggest surprise if not for ``Blair Witch.'' Made for a
bargain-basement $11 million with no stars, the R-rated comedy was
the most successful at aiming for a specific audience - teen-age
boys - and will propel raunchy projects for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Disney also scored surprisingly well with ``Tarzan'' with a
much-admired marketing campaign that broadened the audience
considerably beyond children and into the teen-age crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Hollywood hit a home run this summer with teen-agers'
apparently insatiable desire for horror films.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sony bombed in late May with ``The Thirteenth Floor,''
the audience remained primed in mid-July when ``Lake Placid,'' with
no major stars, took in a better-than-expected $10 million on its
opening weekend. ``The Haunting,'' ``Deep Blue Sea,'' ``Sixth
Sense'' and ``Blair Witch'' dominated the box office for the next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Except for horror films, studios managed to avoid direct
confrontations for the most part. ``I think studios did a pretty
good job of spacing out the films,'' Devlin said, noting that the
two Julia Roberts films - ``Notting Hill'' and ``Runaway Bride'' -
opened with more than two months between them.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a perfect summer by any means. Warner Bros., after
reviving itself during the winter and spring, began to stumble
again with underperformers in ``Wild Wild West,'' ``Eyes Wide
Shut'' and ``Iron Giant.'' ``Eyes,'' Stanley Kubrick's final film,
was particularly disappointing for many moviegoers who often left
the theater feeling a combination of anger and boredom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's movies like `Eyes Wide Shut' that make people stop going
to the movies,'' said Rick Manly, an Altadena resident and frequent
moviegoer.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, many trackers believe the tone for the summer was set
12 days before ``Phantom Menace'' opened when ``The Mummy''
debuted. For exhibitors, it was a godsend to have another hot film
to play during the ``Phantom Menace'' frenzy and answered their
most frequent complaint to Hollywood - give us your best movies all
year, not just around summer and Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   `` `The `Mummy' was such a nice surprise,'' said Devlin. ``It
was perfect popcorn entertainment and set the tone for a lot of
sort of review-proof movies.''

SUMMER BOX OFFICE FIGURES WILL EASILY SURPASS LAST YEAR'S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hollywood studios, wielding a finely tuned
hype-and-buzz machine, have confounded the skeptics this summer
with an astounding string of successes at the nation's box office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big surprise has been how well the overall business held
up every single weekend,'' said Drew Devlin, president of Clark
Film Buying in Bozeman, Mont. ``I'm a firm believer in the notion
that going to the movies is a habit and once you get people going
to good movies, they keep on going.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood will easily smash last summer's Memorial Day-Labor Day
record of $2.58 billion by at least 20 percent, or better than $500
million. That's not just because of a certain movie about Jedi
Knights and lightsabers; it reflects the industry's ability to walk
the fine line of - on the one hand - delivering mass-entertainment
films that - on the other - somehow offer something that's never
been seen before.
</P>
<P>
   The summer season's real power emerged after ``Star Wars:
Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace'' had been open for three weeks,
when ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' opened with a
stunning $54 million weekend total.
</P>
<P>
   That triggered a run that has made Hollywood history - 10
different films have led the box office for 10 consecutive weeks,
including this weekend's expected winner, ``Bowfinger.'' The
previous record had been seven consecutive weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The diversity of films shows the studios have spread out their
best films well with a lot of doubles and triples,'' Devlin said.
``All in all, the exhibitors have been pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantom Menace'' was a huge help to its rivals, analysts
contend, as moviegoers ignored critical carping over Jar Jar Binks
and the inevitable comparison with the original ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like `Titanic' lifted the rest of the box office,
`Phantom Menace' did the same thing,'' said Robert Bucksbaum,
president of the Reel Source forecasting service.
</P>
<P>
   ``When `Phantom Menace' sold out in the first weeks, people went
to see other films,'' he added. ``A good film gets everyone in the
mood to go to the movies and enables other films to be hits.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just the No. 1 films that have driven this summer's
box office. The season will probably be best remembered for a
bizarre film about three novice moviemakers disappearing into the
Maryland wilderness in search of a 200-year-old witch. At a time
when the average film costs over $50 million to produce, ``The
Blair Witch Project'' was done for less than one-thousandth of
that.
</P>
<P>
   Though it never finished first, ``Blair Witch'' ignited
midsummer moviegoing as it crossed over from the art-house circuit
to shopping-mall multiplexes. It also redefined how to create the
pre-opening sizzle among the most lucrative moviegoing sector -
teen-agers and young adults - by offering up a completely unique
film that somehow had the feel of ``this really happened.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even three weeks ago, people would have laughed at the idea of
`Blair Witch' grossing over $100 million,'' Bucksbaum said. ``It's
going to lead to a huge wave of change. Just like `Titanic'
convinced people that they could spend $200 million and still be
successful, studio executives are going to be looking for this kind
of movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The marketing for ``Blair Witch'' - consisting of a disturbing
trailer and an Internet site that offered clues and background on
the fictional 1994 incident - cost Artisan Entertainment less than
$10 million. The studio has been taking out advertisements in Daily
Variety bragging not about its gross - which should be around $110
million by the end of this weekend - but the number of hits at
www.blairwitch.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to the success of `Blair Witch' is its cleverness,''
said Joseph Butt Jr., an analyst with Forrester Research. ``It
worked brilliantly because it used the Internet effectively as a
multichannel marketing campaign. It demonstrated that it can be a
very effective medium and filled in a lot of story.''

RATTLERS GO DOWN IN FLAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It took a half for the smoke to clear Saturday at
Pepsi Arena. By then, the Rattlers' season was in ashes.
</P>
<P>
   With Eddie Brown showing why he's got the nickname
``Touchdown,'' and haunted by so many past semifinal failures, the
Albany Firebirds rolled into the ArenaBowl for the first time with
a 73-47 rout before 10,043 fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything went their way,'' defensive specialist Cedric
Walker said. ``We couldn't put a foot in front of them to slow them
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Overzealous pyrotechnics weren't needed to fire up the Firebirds
(13-3) with enough pre-game fireworks to light up (cough, cough)
the New York night. Albany had been here enough, losing four
semifinal games in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   The game was delayed five minutes for some of the smoke to
dissipate so the Rattlers could find the ball when it was kicked
off the net. The half was played in a haze, which, it seemed, was
where the Rattlers' heads were throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never put any pressure on them, and, when you don't put any
pressure on them, they can pretty much do whatever they want,''
said quarterback Sherdrick Bonner, who made his first appearance of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he spent the night tossing and turning. After
Saturday, he'll be in defensive specialist Cecil Doggette's
nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who had a 41-game touchdown streak snapped in last week's
first-round victory over Grand Rapids, scored four touchdowns,
setting an Arena Football League playoff record with 239 receiving
yards. He caught 13 passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so riled up, I had so much adrenaline, I just couldn't
sleep,'' Brown said. ``But that's not unusual before a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially a game as big as this.
</P>
<P>
   In defense of Doggette, he played the game with a sore left
hamstring that caused him to miss the last three regular-season
games. He aggravated it in practice early in the week and was held
out until Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it was more physical or mental, wondering in
the back of my mind if I was going to pull it again,'' Doggette
said.
</P>
<P>
   The only chance the Rattlers had was to put pressure on
quarterback Mike Pawlawski, and that didn't happen enough.
Pawlawski knows every step Brown is going to make. He also was
eager to meet up with these guys after missing a meeting here in
May, in which backup Jeff Loots riddled the Rattlers in a 59-54
victory, as Pawlawski spent the game in a hospital with a bleeding
ulcer.
</P>
<P>
   Pawlawski passed for 303 yards, completing 22 of 32. He was not
intercepted. The Firebirds didn't fumble either.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner, who rejoined the Rattlers on Tuesday after getting cut
by the Atlanta Falcons on Monday, said, ``This was more
disappointing than what happened to me earlier in the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonner nearly matched Pawlawski's yardage (298) and had six
touchdowns passes, but he was picked off once and lost two snaps.
</P>
<P>
   Add Van Johnson's 56-yard kickoff return, the Firebirds scored
28 points after Rattlers turnovers and a special-teams breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Danny White used a different math, calculating what would
have happened if the Rattlers had scored instead of turned the ball
over: ``That's 42 points, right there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to overcome that, unless you're playing a team that
is making mistakes and giving it back to you, and they never did,''
White said. ``They weren't very good hosts.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Firebirds scored on every possession, being held out
of the end zone only twice, as Don Silvestri kicked field goals of
42 and 23 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to hand it to Albany,'' White said. ``They
played a perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pawlawski and Brown have such a great rapport.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said if he had to carry the Firebirds on his shoulders,
he'd do it. But all he was looking to do, he said, was not bust an
assignment and do the ``little'' things to help get them to a place
they've never been.
</P>
<P>
   Albany will stay home to play the eighth-seeded Orlando
Predators next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (11-5), playing musical quarterbacks in the last month,
lost three of its last four games, but, for the first time in four
games, scored more than 35 points.
</P>
<P>
   Despite six touchdown passes from Bonner, who had only three
days to reacquaint himself with his former team and the 50-yard
game, this was a collective loss.
</P>
<P>
   Defense, special teams, and the offense broke down too many
times to beat an average team. Against the league's highest-scoring
offense, it was no contest. &QL;

CO-LEADER HAS OFTEN FELT LEFT OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, ILL. - The young man who is tied for the lead at the
PGA Championship is a minority. Growing up, he often felt
self-conscious, different from most other kids. All his life he has
experienced the sting of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Question is, can he beat Tiger Woods?
</P>
<P>
   His name is Mike Weir.
</P>
<P>
   Mike is left-handed.
</P>
<P>
   We live in a right-handed world. Every day the 12 percent or so
of people who were born left-handed face inconveniences and
challenges the rest of us don't.
</P>
<P>
   Left-handers must shake hands using their right hands. Since we
write from left to right, a left-handed person risks getting ink
stains on his hand. Using scissors can be a hardship. For a
left-handed child, most school desks are unusable.
</P>
<P>
   Know the French word for left? It's ``gauche,'' which also means
clumsy or socially inept. When you receive a left-handed
compliment, how does it make you feel?
</P>
<P>
   Left-handers happily point out that if the right side of the
brain controls the left side of the body, then only left-handed
people are in their right minds.
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo da Vinci was a lefty. So was Aristotle. Picasso.
Michelangelo. Beethoven. Einstein. Babe Ruth. So is Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But how many accomplished left-handed golfers can you name _
other than Phil Mickelson? Bob Charles is the only lefty ever to
win a major championship.
</P>
<P>
   So good luck to Mike Weir. I'm pulling for him. Today _ two days
after International Left-Handers Day _ the 5-foot-9, 150-pound
Canadian, who has never won a PGA Tour event, lost his tour card
last year, and is ranked 103rd in the world, has the opportunity to
win the last of golf's four majors.
</P>
<P>
   All he has to do is beat Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   In a head-to-head duel.
</P>
<P>
   With the crowd cheering wildly for the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't that be a story.
</P>
<P>
   Weir's daunting task brings to mind the scene in the movie
``Dumb and'' ``Dumber'' where Jim Carrey asks a beautiful young
woman what the chances are of her becoming romantically interested
in him. One in a hundred? Be honest.
</P>
<P>
   ``One in a ``million'','' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you're telling me,'' Carrey's thick-headed character says
excitedly, ``there's a ``chance''!''
</P>
<P>
   The odds, of course, heavily favor Tiger Woods Inc. Woods won
the last seven tournaments in which he held the lead going into the
final round. While he only shares the lead with Weir, the general
feeling is that Woods should win his first major since his
record-setting victory at the 1997 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is on his game. He sounds confident. The other day he was
asked if the length of the Medinah Country Club course (7,401
yards) is a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not for me,'' Woods said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Weir understands and accepts his role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind being the underdog,'' he said, not that he has a
choice. The 29-year-old was paired with Woods in the final round of
the recent Western Open. Woods' victory was cause for celebration
in the Chicago area, where Woods is only slightly less popular than
Ernie Banks.
</P>
<P>
   Weir is viewed as something of a curiosity. Canada hasn't
produced many great golfers. The fact that he hits the ball from
the ``wrong'' side is seen by many (mostly right-handers) as
another reason to bet against him.
</P>
<P>
   It can be difficult being left-handed. When Weir was 13, he
wrote a letter to Jack Nicklaus. The boy wanted to know, if he
decided to pursue golf, whether he should switch to right-handed.
To Weir's surprise, Nicklaus wrote him back. He told the boy not to
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the greatest player of all times told me to stick to it,''
Weir said, smiling, ``I was going to stick to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now here he is with a chance to do something no southpaw has
done since Charles won the British Open in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you told me at the beginning of the year I was going to be
in this situation, I would say there was no way,'' Weir said with
refreshing candor.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've been gaining confidence. Gaining momentum. I don't
have anything to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, except the PGA Championship. &QL;

TIGER LEADS YOUNG LIONS AT MEDINAH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BY JOHN DAVIS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ The 81st PGA Championship has been thrown to the
young lions. Make that three lions and one Tiger, who knows how to
pounce when the scent of victory is in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, who has won seven straight tournaments when leading
after three rounds, moved into a tie for the lead with Mike Weir on
Friday at Medinah Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, 23, and Weir, 29, were at 11-under 205, 2 shots ahead of
19-year-old Sergio Garcia and 26-year-old Stewart Cink. That
foursome, which averages just over 24 years old, moved to the front
Saturday when the likes of 45-year-old Jay Haas and 54-year-old
Hale Irwin failed to keep pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players these days are getting very good, very fast,'' Cink
said in explaining the youth movement. ``Guys are learning how to
play earlier, they're playing more, they're stronger and they have
better equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at his young age, Woods has the edge in experience among
the leaders, especially when it comes to winning PGA Tour events.
He has 14 victories, with four this year, including one major _ the
1997 Masters. The other three have one victory combined, by Cink in
the 1997 Greater Hartford Open.
</P>
<P>
   When he breezed to that Masters win in record-shattering
fashion, it seemed to many that Woods would be in the hunt for
every major event for years to come, but that hasn't happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came out, I won in '97 by 12 shots and everyone
thought you can do that every time you tee it up,'' he said.
``Well, golf's not really like that. It's very difficult to win
major championships. You've got to have some lucky breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That week, everything went my way, and I understand that
people are basing their expectation level on that week. Whether
that's realistic or not, I don't know. But it is very difficult to
win major championships, and to win them the way I did and win them
frequently. Just to win one is an accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Just being here is an accomplishment for Weir, who will be
paired with Woods today.
</P>
<P>
   He's trying to become the first Canadian and the only
left-hander besides Bob Charles to win a major. That, and playing
with Woods, might seem like too much pressure to handle, but Weir
doesn't think so after the road he's traveled to play on the tour.
</P>
<P>
   After college, he tried qualifying school for five years,
playing the Australian Tour when he failed, then finally earned his
tour card last year, but didn't earn enough to keep it. He went
back to tour school this year and nearly shot himself out of the
qualifying tournament with a 75 in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember many times that I was missing cuts on the
Australian Tour,'' he said. ``Then you're by yourself, you don't
have any money and your're out there practicing until you can't see
a shot 5 feet in front of you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are things I'll always have in my memory bank. Those are
the tough times and if anything contributes to my determination now
it's because I know how hard it was to get here.''
</P>
<P>
   That determination has paid off as Weir has earned nearly
$600,000 this season and three times has been paired in the final
group of a PGA event.
</P>
<P>
   One of those was with Woods, July 4 at the Motorola Western Open
in nearby Lemont, Ill. He also was in the final pairing with David
Duval in the BellSouth Classic in April and with Tommy Tolles and
Barry Cheesman in the Touchstone Energy Tucson Open.
</P>
<P>
   While he failed to win any of them, Weir has improved each time,
shooting 73 in Tucson, 72 in the BellSouth and 70 in the Western in
his final rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind being the underdog,'' he said. ``Tiger's the best
player in the world and I didn't even have my card a few months
ago, but I'm making strides in my game. If you had told me at the
beginning of this year I was going to be here, I would have said,
`No way.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Weir got here by shooting a round of 69 Saturday, highlighted by
an eagle at the par-5 14th hole, where he hit a pitch shot from 35
yards away over a bunker and into the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Woods shot 68, carding five birdies and one bogey, including a
chip-in from 50 feet on the par-4 sixth hole. Cink and Garcia also
shot 68 on a day when Medinah No. 3 played much tougher than it had
the first two days because of swirling winds.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, who is considered the European version of Woods, had
four birdies during his bogey-free round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about playing (today) with Tiger,'' the young
Spaniard said. ``I was doing my best but I couldn't catch him. It
was almost impossible. It looked like if I made a birdie, he went
behind me and made one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he keeps playing like he did today, maybe we have to look
for second place, but I'm going to do my best to try to catch
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Haas, the second-round leader, slumped to a 75, putting him 5
shots off the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Joining him at 6-under 210 were Nick Price, Jim Furyk and Skip
Kendall. Furyk, the University of Arizona product, played the first
five holes in 4 under par, with an eagle at the par-4 fourth hole.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, the Senior Tour player from Paradise Valley who started
the day four shots behind Haas, failed to keep pace, carding seven
bogeys in a round of 68 to fall 12 strokes behind. &QL;

MERCURY HAS PAYBACK IN MIND FOR STING'S LAUGHTER IN ROMP

<P>
   PHOENIX - The Mercury and Charlotte Sting arrived at Sky Harbor
Airport at the same time on Saturday, coming from different
locations and going in different directions.
</P>
<P>
   When their paths intersect for a game at 7 tonight, the slight
difference in their records is not reflected in the standings. The
Sting (15-14) has all but clinched a third consecutive WNBA playoff
berth, while the Mercury (13-15), playing in the vastly superior
Western Conference, has no chance of continuing its playoff string
with four games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But there are reasons for Phoenix to still play hard: the chance
for fourth place in the West and a winning record, possibly better
than that of all but one team in the East; to extend to franchise
record nine-game win streak at America West Arena; and perhaps most
of all for payback, which it owes Charlotte in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   Including a pair of preseason games this season, the Sting has
five straight decisions over the Mercury. And it won so easily on
June 24, 88-72, after leading by as much as 23 points, that it took
to making fun of its slow-footed opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most embarrassing thing was they were laughing at us,''
forward Jennifer Gillom said at the time. ``That's the second time
that's happened. It's a matter of pride now.''
</P>
<P>
   And Phoenix was only 2-4 after losing that game. It sank all the
way to 3-10 before beginning a recovery that diminishes even what
Charlotte has accomplished since firing Coach/General Manager
Marynell Meadors on July 11 and promoting assistant Dan Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Since July 12, the Sting (5-7 under Meadors) is 10-7 under
Hughes, an assistant men's then women's coach at the University of
Toledo from 1991-97, while the Mercury is 10-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing (difference) has been the rebounding,''
Hughes said. ``The team has taken a lot of the effort and focus
that they wanted to improve with and put it into rebounding. It's
really impacted our defensive play.''
</P>
<P>
   But in its past five games, four of them losses to West teams,
Charlotte has been outrebounded by a combined 172-120.
</P>
<P>
   The Sting is coming off a 78-64 loss at Sacramento on Friday
that leaves it still one win shy of the playoffs. It also fell
Monday to Utah, 67-65, which defeated the Mercury, 67-64, on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's old, but we're not just playing for ourselves,
we're playing for Phoenix now and pride,'' said Mercury point guard
Michele Timms. ``And it would be nice to finish the season with a
few wins against teams that are going to be in the finals
(playoffs).
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be nice to sit back and say we had a bit of a bad patch
at the start that really hurt us, but we beat those teams at the
end of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix also plays West playoff qualifiers Sacramento and
Houston in a Tuesday-Wednesday back-to-back before closing the
season against Utah on Friday. &QL;

LATE-INNING LOSS SPOILS GOOD DEEDS FOR RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Juan Gonzalez was back in the lineup and going deep,
Ivan Rodriguez recorded his historic 20th stolen base and Rafael
Palmeiro reached 30 home runs and 100 runs batted in for the fifth
consecutive season.
</P>
<P>
   But through the thick gloom of the Rangers postgame clubhouse,
nobody was interested in talking about individual accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask me tomorrow,'' Rodriguez said after becoming the first
major-league catcher to hit 20 homers and steal 20 bases in a
season. ``Not tonight; 20-20 is better when we win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers didn't win last night. Instead they saw two-out
ninth-inning home runs by Palmeiro and Todd Zeile go to waste when
the White Sox rallied in the bottom of the inning for a
sloppy-but-exciting, 8-7, victory at Comiskey Park.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile should have been one of the heroes after his game-tying
home run. Instead, he was among the most frustrated afterward.
Zeile slipped while trying to field a ninth-inning bunt, a pivotal
play in leading to the White Sox's game-winning run.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly one of those days that will test the old
fortitude,'' Zeile said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to win ballgames,'' said Gonzalez, who had a two-run
home run and a run-scoring double in his first game back since
straining his left hamstring on Tuesday. ``I felt all right, but
the thing is to win the ballgame. Oakland is playing great.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, after their fourth consecutive loss, need to pay a
little more attention to the Oakland Athletics. The second-place
Athletics defeated the Toronto Blue Jays, 13-5, yesterday and trail
the Rangers by 41/2 games in the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two weeks, ten days ago we were the best thing since sliced
bread,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ``We will be again. All those
things were once going in our favor, and they will again. You watch
the worm; it will turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to have it turn, you have to catch the ball and make good
pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers didn't last night when it counted most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frustrating,'' losing pitcher Jeff Zimmerman (9-2) said.
``Nothing else describes it. We haven't been playing good baseball.
We're losing games we should be winning, and it's got to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers thought they had it stopped. They led 5-2 into the
sixth, but the White Sox rallied for four runs that inning against
starter Mike Morgan and reliever Tim Crabtree. The Rangers then
erased the White Sox's 7-5 lead with two out in the ninth when
Palmeiro and Zeile hit back-to-back home runs off White Sox closer
Bob Howry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our chances of winning right there were great,''
Palmeiro said. ``We just needed to get back in and hit, but we
didn't get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Ray Durham led off the ninth with a single. Mike Caruso
followed with a sacrifice bunt up the third base line, but Zeile
slipped as he went to field it and kicked the ball into foul
territory. Durham raced to third on the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went to field it ... thick grass, and it's damp that time
of night,'' Zeile said. ``I went to stop, and my body would, but my
feet wouldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Thomas was walked intentionally to load the bases, and the
Rangers brought Mark McLemore in from right field as a fifth
infielder. But it didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman did get Magglio Ordonez on a short pop to right, but
Paul Konerko hit his fly ball a little deeper, and Roberto Kelly
had no shot at getting the speedy Durham at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only positive about this game is we had life in the ninth
inning,'' Palmeiro said. ``That and having Juan back in the lineup.
You can see what happens when he plays. Everything else you can
throw out.''

HALL TO JOIN PAN PACIFIC TEAM  
 EARNS BERTH WITH DRAMATIC FREESTYLE WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Five months ago, Gary Hall Jr. thought he might quit.
Today, there are probably some rivals who wish that he had.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, of Phoenix Swim Club, re-established himself as a major
threat for medals at the 2000 Olympics with a dramatic victory in
the 50-meter freestyle at the national championships at Minneapolis
five days ago.
</P>
<P>
   With his comeback win, Hall earned an invitation to compete for
the U.S. team in Sydney at the Pan Pacific Championships, which is
considered a major steppingstone to the 2000 Olymic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, a silver and gold medalist at the 1996 Olympics, plans to
travel on Tuesday to Sydney where he will join the U.S. team, which
departed Friday. The team, also includes Misty Hyman, a Phoenix
native who is about begin her junior year at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Pursley of U.S. Swimming said Hall was given permission
to arrive late because he needed to regain weight and adjust levels
of insulin he has been taking since he was diagnosed with diabetes
in March.
</P>
<P>
   Hall was suffering from the flu five days before the nationals
last week when the 24-year sprinter won the 50 at 22.13, fifth
fastest in history. The performance would have tied him with
Alexander Popov for the 1996 gold medalist Atlanta, where he went
22.26.
</P>
<P>
   It also has put him within striking distance of the world record
of 21.81, which was set by Tom Jager in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to really expect,'' Hall said after his
victory in Minneapolis. ``There's just been so much I've had to
overcome. It's been so long since I've raced that it was like a new
sensation for me. I could tell that I hadn't done it in such a long
time. I was really nervous, and I'm not usually that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall has fought the International Olympic Committee over a
three-month suspension it handed down for a positive marijuana
test. He also has had repeated battles with the bureaucracy that
runs U.S. swimming.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pan Pacs, he also is eligible to swim the 100-meter
freestyle and legs on the 4x100 medley and 4x100 freestyle relays,
according to Pursley, the national team director and one of the
officials who has often been at odds with the Phoenix swimmer.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Klete Keller of Phoenix Swim Club and Brophy Prep won the
5,000 meter title last week in Minnesota and qualified for the Pan
Pacs.
</P>
<P>
   His younger sister, Kalyn, won a Bronze medal in the 200
Butterfly for the U.S. this summer at the Pan Am Games in Canada. &QL;

TIGER TIED FOR LEAD AT PGA (For use by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ If it's crunch time in suburban Chicago, Tiger
Woods and Mike Weir must be in control of the leader board.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in a month, they are.
</P>
<P>
   The final pairing in today's closing round of the PGA
Championship at Medinah Country Club is identical to the one that
tromped across the crosstown fairways at Cog Hill Golf &AMP; Country
Club to decide the Western Open on July 4. That day, Woods
prevailed over Weir by three shots.
</P>
<P>
   PGA pursuers indicated they would be surprised if a similar
scenario does not unfold at Medinah, where Woods and Weir will
begin the final round tied, at 11-under par. Stewart Cink and
Sergio Garcia remain two strokes back, at 9-under, but no one else
is closer than five shots.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, for one, sounded ready to concede the Wanamaker Trophy
to Woods at the end of the third round.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Tiger keeps playing like he played \Ryesterday\S, maybe we
have to look for the second place,'' Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, added Fred Couples, Woods is once again in the driver's
seat in the Windy City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be tough for anyone else in the field to beat him,
regardless of who he's paired with,'' Couples said. ``Tiger's just
a better player. He's the best player in the world right now.
There's more pressure on Weir than Tiger, because \RWeir\S will
have to play his absolute best to beat him. Tiger doesn't have to
do that to win.''
</P>
<P>
   If Woods isn't at the top of his game, he's showing Medinah
galleries a reasonable facsimile. Woods breezed through a
five-birdie, one-bogey 68 yesterday, matching the lowest score of
the third round. He had a 50-foot chip-in for one birdie and
tap-ins for two others. In backing a second-round 67 with a
third-round 68, Woods has posted the two lowest scores in his past
19 rounds at major championships on consecutive days at Medinah.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt primed to pick up his second major
championship, Woods said: ``I am ready, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Weir, a Canadian who was the medalist at the 1998 PGA Tour
qualifying tournament, understands the challenge he faces today. He
is just glad he will begin the final round on even footing, rather
than with a four-shot deficit, as he did at the Western Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes it a little different scenario. Still, I am
obviously the underdog,'' said Weir, who picked up three strokes on
the final five holes by chipping in for eagle at No. 14 and
draining a 20-foot birdie putt at No. 17. ``I realize the crowds
are going to be pulling for him hard, but I can't pay attention to
all that stuff. I don't think this is Tiger's tournament to lose.
Anybody could have a hot day and win.''
</P>
<P>
   If the frontrunners stumble, two-time PGA champ Nick Price and
Jim Furyk headline a four-player group at 6-under, five strokes off
the pace. Brandt Jobe, a Southlake resident who competes on the
Japanese Tour, sits in ninth place, at 4-under, after yesterday's
69.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth resident Mark Brooks, the 1996 PGA champ, recorded a
hole-in-one during a round of 70 and moved into 14th place, at
3-under for the tournament. Brooks has not finished better than
38th (1999 Masters) at any major since his victory at the 1996 PGA.
</P>
<P>
   At eight strokes off the pace, Brooks said he's a long shot to
win but is glad to be making noise again at a major championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing fine. I just want to keep it going for another
round,'' Brooks said. ``I don't have any expectations for
\Rtoday\S. I can't control what the other guys shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, however, finds himself in control of his destiny after 54
holes at a major championship for the first time since the 1997
Masters. There, he won by a record-setting 12 shots. He's won the
past seven tournaments where he has held a 54-hole lead.
</P>
<P>
   He knows that others view him as the man to beat this afternoon
at Medinah.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult to win one major championship,'' Woods
said. ``I need to take care of business before I can start worrying
about kicking in the door and winning my second. But I do feel
comfortable in this position. I enjoy being in a position where
everybody's trying to beat me. That usually brings out my best.
Hopefully, that will be good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, Woods will leave the Windy City with his first Wanamaker
Trophy. Not to mention a 2-0 lead in final-round duels with Mike
Weir. nn

BUSH SETS HIS CAMPAIGN'S SIGHTS ON IOWA CAUCUSES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMES, Iowa _ Republican presidential front-runner George W. Bush
failed to net any bass while fishing Saturday morning, but he
landed a big one at night with a victory at the Iowa Republican
Party presidential straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know that I know this is just the beginning.
I've got a lot of work to do,'' Bush told a pompom-waving crowd of
about 250 supporters in a circus-style tent after the vote. ``But
this victory today in Iowa put me on the road to winning the
nomination of the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said pundits contended he had little to gain and much to
lose two months ago when he announced that he would participate in
the straw poll despite a late start campaigning in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to you, we gained a lot,'' Bush said. ``We have more
than accomplished what we set out to do. We jump-started our
grass-roots organization for the main event, the Iowa caucuses.''
</P>
<P>
   The caucuses next January are the first major test of the
presidential candidates in a contest that actually begins the
process of selecting delegates to the national nominating
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Bush finished first in the straw poll balloting at about 31
percent, followed by Steve Forbes at 21 percent. Elizabeth Dole was
third with 14 percent. They were the only candidates to finish in
double-digits.
</P>
<P>
   After speaking to his supporters, Bush told the Houston
Chronicle he does not believe that his nomination is now
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all ... You can never take anything for granted in the
political process,'' Bush said. ``I've got to get my organization
in place in other states. This is just the beginning in Iowa.``
</P>
<P>
   Bush congratulated his opponents, but also said some might want
to ``reassess'' whether their campaigns are still competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had entered the straw poll confidently, saying he was
``laying the groundwork'' for the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   The straw poll ``is an interesting test of our organization.
Where we're strong, we'll bolster our strengths. Where we find
weakness in our organization, we'll change,'' Bush said hours
before the votes were in.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign had set a spending limit of $750,000 on the
straw poll for exhibit space, phone banks, direct mail,
entertainment, tickets to vote at the event and buses to bring
supporters from across Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're judicious in our budget, run no TV ads,'' Bush said.
``Our organization worked late into the night to get our votes
turned out.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bush's victory, a poll released Saturday indicated there
is still softness to Bush's strength in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 400 Iowa Republicans found Bush leading his next
closest opponent by 17 percentage points. But the poll by The
Polling Co. of Washington, D.C., also found 55 percent said they do
not know where Bush stands on issues important to them, and 45
percent were unable to name any of Bush's accomplishments as Texas
governor.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth of those polled said the first words that came to mind
when they heard Bush's name were ``his father'' or ``his family
background.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush started his public events Saturday with a bass fishing
demonstration with professional Johnny Morris at a small lake owned
by the Izaak Walton League, a hunting and fishing conservation
organization. Bush, flipping a yellow-tailed spinner, came off a
pier fishless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't trying to catch fish, and it worked,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the straw poll audience in the Hilton Coliseum
on the campus of Iowa State University, Bush promised that as
president he would push for tax cuts and improve schools. He said
he also will end an era of negative campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country is hungry for a new style of campaign: positive,
hopeful and optimistic,'' Bush said, ``a campaign that appeals to
our better angels, not our darker impulses.''
</P>
<P>
   Long lines of Bush supporters waited at the Texas governor's
tent for barbecue. Tracy Bird and Emilio Navaira provided
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, more than 350 motorcyclists led by U.S. Sen. Ben
Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., and Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson
roared onto the straw poll grounds as Bikers for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush briefly posed for photographers on a motorcycle after
telling the motorcyclists: ``We're all Republicans here because we
believe in individual freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, appearing on CNN's ``Evans, Novak Hunt &AMP; Shields'' show,
defended the National Rifle Association, from which his father
resigned in 1995 after the group's director called federal officers
``jack-booted thugs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't view them as a great demon,'' Bush said of the NRA,
noting, however, that he is not a member. ``If I agree with them, I
will do so. If I don't agree with them, I will be bold enough to
say so.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he favors instant background checks for gun
purchases, but he said he believes it is more important to enforce
the nation's gun laws than to pass new laws restricting gun
ownership.

STOTTLEMYRE EAGER FOR RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL CORO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Sure, Todd Stottlemyre wanted the sleepless nights of
worrying about his career, the guilt of not giving the return on a
four-year, $32 million contract and the shoulder pain to end.
</P>
<P>
   But when Stottlemyre was throwing poorly Saturday before his
last rehabilitation start in Tucson, he turned to pitching
coordinator Gil Patterson and said, ``I gotta get it to another
level. I can't take these 9:30 (a.m.) games anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   His next notch produced a seven-inning Rookie League complete
game, yielding six hits and one run with no walks and 10 strikeouts
on 81 pitches. Stoked about the longest outing of his comeback, he
sped up Interstate 10 to even beat some teammates to the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   After a three-month battle to be part of Arizona's pennant
chase, Stottlemyre will start Friday at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   He elected to pass on the common option of surgery to repair his
mostly torn rotator cuff in May and said he had players and coaches
asking, ``Are you crazy? How are you going to pitch without
surgery?''
</P>
<P>
   Just fine, so far, with a new grip suggested by pitching coach
Mark Connor to ease the shoulder strain and put the sink back in
his sinker.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has felt progressively better since that discouraging
first day of throwing six weeks ago. Team physician David Zeman
already had told him he was ``a miracle'' at that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had made up my mind I'd pitch again this year,'' Stottlemyre
said. ``This is the neatest group of guys I've ever been around my
whole career and I wanted to be a part of it. To get back and pitch
for this club again meant everything to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre spent five weeks lifting weights without picking up
a ball before two simulated starts and three Rookie League outings.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling as though he is entering a new season, Stottlemyre said
he will change his work habits between starts to strengthen his
legs for a new tighter motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought my stuff was normal,'' he said of Saturday's
victory. ``The big thing was getting up and down seven times and
not having problems getting loose each inning. ``It's hard for me
to believe that my MRIs look as bad as they do and I feel as good
as I do. I'll take each start as another new gift.'' &QL; 
Kim throws again &QL; 
To close the doubleheader Stottlemyre started, Byung-Hyun Kim made
his first game appearance of his neck strain rehabilitation with
two shutout innings. Kim will throw this week for one of Arizona's
minor league affiliates. &QL; 
Lee in the outfield &QL; 
Manager Buck Showalter said slumping first baseman Travis Lee's
recent outfield practice was mainly to give the team flexibility
rather than call up a player in light of Steve Finley (back) and
Tony Womack (leg) missing recent games with injuries. &QL;

STAR'S PROFANE TIRADE DESERVED DISCIPLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apparently not happy that their thunder in Southern California
was being taken away by the Anaheim Angels, the Los Angeles Dodgers
reclaimed their status as the preimminent baseball franchise in the
Los Angeles area last week.
</P>
<P>
   But just like their brethren in Orange County, the Dodgers
gathered attention for all the wrong reasons. Right fielder  &UR; Raul
Mondesi's profanity-filled tirade against Manager  &UR; Davey Johnson
and General Manager  &UR; Kevin Malone has left the Dodgers in a serious
spin-control mode.
</P>
<P>
   But is it a battle that can be won? Mondesi laced into his two
immediate superiors in a way that would have anyone in the real
world tossed out on his backside within seconds. This being the
world of professional sports, though, the Dodgers, to date, have
done nothing to seriously discipline Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, knowing full well whom he was talking to, told Dodgers
beat writers in Montreal last week that he was no longer willing to
play for ``(expletive) Davey and (expletive) Malone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of all this,'' said Mondesi, 28. ``I told my agent
to get me the (expletive) out of here as soon as possible. I can't
take this anymore. I've had to deal with this all year. I told them
to trade me because I don't want to (expletive) be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Expletive) Davey and (expletive) Malone, they try to put all
of our problems on me. They're trying to say that all this
(expletive) is my fault. That's the way they feel, fine. Just get
me out of here. (Expletive) Davey. (Expletive) Malone. (Expletive)
both of them.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, a suspension for conduct detrimental to the
organization would have been warranted and most likely received in
a positive manner from frustrated Dodgers fans, who believe the new
Fox administration is taking everything the Dodgers have stood for
and turning it upside down.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost impossible to believe the  &UR; Peter O'Malley-owned
Dodgers would have allowed such comments to be passed along without
serious consequences. It would be foolish for the Dodgers to make a
snap judgement and simply trade Mondesi (although that would not be
a simple process considering he has $20 million owed over the final
two years of his four-year, $36 million contract, which also
includes a pair of club-owned options in 2002 and 2003 worth $12
million each).
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, the 1994 National League Rookie of the Year and the
first Brooklyn or Los Angeles Dodger ever to hit 30 home runs and
steal 30 bases in the same season, is an immensely talented player
who is capable of becoming a Most Valuable Player at any time.
</P>
<P>
   He possesses all five tools that scouts so tirelessly search for
in players. Mondesi may feel singled out for the Dodgers' abysmal
season, but that's simply not the case. This is a club that has
suffered a total collapse and is showing what little character it
has within its ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers divulged last week that Mondesi has privately been
fined regularly this season. It's obvious that shielding Mondesi
from criticism has not worked so far. Maybe it's time to take this
mess more public and make a stand, one O'Malley certainly would
have taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't acceptable, and we're taking the appropriate steps
internally,'' said Malone, a good man of strong convictions who
must have become sick upon learning of the outburst. ``We're going
to handle the situation as we feel is best, but we're going to keep
that within the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as far as what we're going to do long term, I'm not going
to comment on that. We're going to keep all of our options open and
we're going to continue to support Raul and help him in any way we
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, a native of the Domini can Republic, will never be a
vocal leader and that's OK. He cannot, though, become what he
showed last week, a childish boor ready to pack it in just because
things aren't going his way.
</P>
<P>
   He's better than that and he knows it. At the very least, he
should know it. He's not a child anymore and should be held
accountable for his actions. &QL; 
Trivial question &QL; 
Third baseman  &UR; Wade Boggs took the mound for Tampa Bay last week
during a 17-1 drubbing at the hands of the Baltimore Orioles. It
was only the second time in major league history that a player with
3,000 hits pitched for his club. Can you name the other? &QL; 
Another disgruntled soul &QL; 
 &UR; Frank Thomas, the identity of the Chicago White Sox, is another
player unhappy with his role and ballclub. Breaking the
smile-everyday-image he has maintained all season, Thomas let it be
known that he simply does not want to play first base again, a
point that seemed to be driven home after he botched a play that
led to a five-run outburst by Oakland last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I booted it, that's why I'm a designated hitter,'' he told
White Sox writers in an expletive-filled tirade. ``I'm not a first
baseman.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day brought no reversal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a DH all last year, and I'm a DH this year,'' he said.
``I've had my time in the field. I know the position I should be
playing, and that's DH. I feel good DH'ing, more comfortable. I've
got to hit. I've got to adjust to that role.''
</P>
<P>
   Most amazing is that Thomas recently turned 31. He's young and
extremely athletic (he also played football in college at Auburn)
and, at one time, was an adequate first baseman. When folks argue
about the designated hitter, this is the worst-case scenario for
those in favor of watching the greats (such as a  &UR; Harold Baines or
a  &UR; Paul Molitor) still playing into their 40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Frank is that he convinces himself that he
can't play somewhere or do something, so he doesn't,'' Manager
 &UR; Jerry Manuel said. ``He takes a strong asset and makes it an
enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are on Manuel's side. Thomas is hitting .345 as a
first baseman with eight home runs and a .553 slugging percentage
compared with .287 with seven home runs and a .450 slugging
percentage as a DH.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Manuel seems to be unwilling to change his
thinking. ``He'll be back out there,'' he said. &QL; 
Opposite end of the spectrum &QL; 
Then there's Cincinnati first baseman  &UR; Sean Casey, as solid and
grounded a human being as there is in the game today. Though Casey
has seen his average drop from .371 at the All-Star break to .346
entering the weekend series, his priorities remain on being an
upstanding citizen first and foremost.
</P>
<P>
   Casey recently befriended a Dayton man about his age who
regularly attends Reds games. The two struck up a friendship and
the man,  &UR; Shane
 &UR; Whiteman, began walking Casey to his car after home games.
</P>
<P>
   Whiteman seemed sad one day last week, and when Casey asked if
anything was wrong, Whiteman told him of his father's sudden death
from a heart attack and how the family could not afford a funeral
or a burial. Casey said, ``I'll pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whiteman refused to accept Casey's offer. But Casey agreed to
appear at a Dayton autograph show last Thursday with all proceeds
going to the father's funeral. Now that's giving back to the
community. &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL; 
In a 1925 game, while playing in his next-to-last season for the
Detroit Tigers,  &UR; Ty Cobb pitched one perfect inning in a similar
mop-up situation. Cobb also pitched four relief innings in 1918 for
the Tigers, allowing two runs on six hits. He was still more than
500 hits shy of reaching 3,000 at that time. &QL; 
Includes information from other media sources. Pedro Gomez can be
reached at (602) 444-2364 or at pedro.gomez(at)pni.com via e-mail. &QL; 
THE HIT LIST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The AL Comedy Central Division is alive and well: Cleveland may
have gone 13-13 before its weekend series, but in the same span the
Indians managed to widen their division lead from 13{ to 17{ games.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Suddenly Suppan: Kansas City starter  &UR; Jeff Suppan, who couldn't
cut it during his time with the Diamondbacks, is finding the
American League much more to his liking. Suppan pitched his second
straight complete game last week and was 7-6 with a 3.74 ERA before
his Saturday start.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Steve Renko.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Leaving an impression (literally): New York Yankees boss
 &UR; George Steinbrenner sent former Yankees third baseman  &UR; Wade Boggs
an original  &UR; LeRoy Neiman painting of  &UR; Joe DiMaggio after Boggs'
3,000th hit. The painting was signed by Neiman and DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Timing is everything: Boggs took the occasion of his 3,000th
hit to make a public pitch to the Devil Rays to pick up his 2000
option. Since Boggs is set to receive somewhere in the $750,000
range, it seems likely Tampa Bay will pick up the option. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Florida's  &UR; Alex Fernandez, still feeling the ill effects of a
surgically repaired shoulder, is about to give way to Boston's
 &UR; Pedro
 &UR; Martinez as baseball's winningest pitcher yet to reach his 30th
birthday. Fernandez is 102-82. Martinez is 101-49 after getting his
17th win of the season Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite blowing his last two save opportunities, Boston
knuckleballer  &UR; Tim Wakefield has been successful in converting 14
of 17 save situations entering the weekend since taking over for
injured closer  &UR; Tom Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta starter  &UR; John Smoltz, unable to throw breaking balls
because of elbow discomfort, is experimenting with a three-quarters
delivery curveball of sorts that had Houston's hitters confounded
last week.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego pitcher  &UR; Brian Boehringer doesn't use a bat with his
own name on it. He also doesn't use a teammate's bat. Boehringer
uses a  &UR; Jackie Robinson model, one he bought at a garage sale
several years ago. It even has the thick handle that many bats from
that era had.
</P>
<P>
   Texas did everything it could during the off-season to trade
away pitcher  &UR; Esteban Loaiza. Now it seems like Loaiza, who is 3-0
with a 3.81 ERA in his five starts since the All-Star break, would
be in the Rangers' rotation if the playoffs began today.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado believed it had received minor league outfielder
 &UR; Thomas Johnson along with  &UR; Brian McRae and  &UR; Rigo Beltran from the
Mets two weeks ago when the Rockies sent  &UR; Darryl Hamilton and
 &UR; Chuck
 &UR; McElroy to New York. It turns out Johnson has decided to retire, a
decision he was contemplating before the trade.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Eddie Murray will take a serious step toward becoming a major
league manager when he takes over the managerial duties of the
Scottsdale Scorpions in the Arizona Fall League this year. Murray,
Baltimore's hitting coach, badly wants to manage and is taking the
same route  &UR; Dusty Baker took seven years ago. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Texas has any inkling of trading  &UR; Juan Gonzalez, count
Detroit as a very interested party. The Tigers made an inquiry into
Gonzalez's availability last month and are open to the idea of
trading away whatever it takes to secure the two-time MVP, who is
eligible for free agency after next year.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati GM  &UR; Jim Bowden is suddenly talking about wanting to
re-sign left fielder  &UR; Greg Vaughn to a contract extension. ``He is
great in the clubhouse and is a positive influence on our young
players,'' Bowden said. ``We wouldn't be where we are without
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay returns to play at Tropicana Field next Friday.
Designated hitter  &UR; Jose Canseco, out since the middle of July after
back surgery, expects to be back in the Devil Rays lineup for the
game against Kansas City. Tampa Bay entered Saturday's game 9-20
since Canseco went down.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal Manager  &UR; Felipe Alou is seriously kicking around the
idea of moving  &UR; Wilton Guerrero from second base to outfield over
the winter. The Expos are seeking a winter ball spot for Guerrero
and may put him in the outfield for all or most of September. Alou
envisions Guerrero taking on a roll similar to that of  &UR; Tony
Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   No one has said anything publicly, but Detroit Manager  &UR; Larry
Parrish last week said he would understand if he weren't asked to
return. The Tigers, who have the worst record in the majors, might
be interested in Atlanta hitting coach  &UR; Don Baylor or  &UR; Phil Garner,
fired by Milwaukee last week.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look now, but it appears the Montreal Expos will probably
remain in Quebec, at least for the 2000 season. Major league
officials are intent to keep their 28-year stretch of no franchise
moves intact, and the Expos appear close to possibly securing a
downtown stadium proposal. It's all iffy, though. &QL; 
THE RANKINGS &QL; 
 &UR; TOP OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. NY YankeesFinished a 6-1 trip to Seattle and Oakland, places the
Yanks usually have trouble.  &QL; 
2. ClevelandCould have five players on its rosterwith 25 home runs
each.  &QL; 
3. AtlantaDon't ever count the Braves out of anything. They still
have gobs of talent.  &QL; 
4. NY MetsEntered the weekend 43-18 since the coaches bloodletting,
er, firings.  &QL; 
5. TexasToronto taking three out of four showed how vulnerable
Rangers are to LH batters.  &QL; 
6. HoustonHad their hats handed to them by a still-impressive
Atlanta club.  &QL; 
7. CincinnatiJust when it seems the Reds are ready to fade, they
jump back in.  &QL; 
8. ArizonaIf you're a D-Backs pitcher, take the body armor out to
the mound.  &QL; 
9. BostonWith rookie  &UR; Brian Daubach doing damage, Sox believe they
are one to beat. &UR; BOTTOM OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
30. DetroitDon't look now, but the worst record in the game is
here.  &QL; 
29. AnaheimEntered the weekend series 5-21 since the All-Star Game.
 &QL; 
28. MontrealThat faint heartbeat is another Expos stadium proposal
on the horizon.  &QL; 
27. Tampa BayIf  &UR; Jose Canseco returns, there may be reason to watch
this club again.  &QL; 
26. FloridaRose up and showed the Giants they are not to be taken
lightly.  &QL; 
25. Kansas CityYuck! The bullpen is up to 25 blown saves, and
counting.  &QL; 
24. ColoradoAnother  &UR; Clemente ( &UR; Roberto's nephew  &UR; Edgard) is
getting a shot in CF.  &QL; 
23. Chicago CubsThings are only going to get worse on the north
side these days.  &QL; 
22. BaltimoreWith nothing to play for, O's fans look for
 &UR; Cal &UR; Ripken  &UR; Jr.'s return. ON THE RISE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Oakland Athletics: They're no longer the East Bay's running
joke. Clubs take the A's seriously these days and for legitimate
reasons. Oakland has run off the best home record (41-19) in all of
baseball. With just a $22 million payroll, the A's are making a
serious run at the American League wild-card spot. While they have
the worst average in the AL, A's hitters have already hit more home
runs than last year's total of 149. The pitching, even with the
dumping of moody
 &UR; Kenny Rogers, has been very good. The addition of  &UR; Kevin Appier and
 &UR; Jason Isringhausen, a potential closer, can only help. &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; San Francisco Giants: Meanwhile, on the other side of the San
Francisco Bay, things have not looked very good since the All-Star
Game. The Giants, who led at the break, fell 7{ games back as the
weekend series began. Closer  &UR; Robb Nen, one of the most dominating
at his position for years, was 0-4 with three blown saves and a
6.55 ERA since the break entering this weekend's series. ``Ever
heard the saying, `buzzard's luck?' ''  &UR; Ellis Burks asked. ``That's
how our luck is going right now. It's buzzard's luck.'' &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; John Palmer, the Seattle Mariners director of Safeco Field
planning and development, has been doing some serious spinning,
trying to get Mariners hitters to accept the lesser home
run-friendly park the club moved into last month. Palmer went this
far in explaining the recent complaining: ``I think it's probably a
recessive gene. But I think how superstitious baseball players are,
how they talk themselves into a mind-set, if they just can relax
and let it go (they'd be better off).'' &QL; 
OUT OF LEFT FIELD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He's no secret anymore. Pittsburgh rookie second baseman
 &UR; Warren Morris is showing all the makings of being the real thing.
Acquired from Texas last season in exchange for  &UR; Esteban Loaiza,
Morris has made the most of his change of scenery. His .306 average
and .379 on-base percentage lead all National League rookies. He
also ranks in the top five among NL rookies in nearly every
offensive category. In short, the Pirates feel like they made a
steal in prying Morris, a minor leaguer at the time, away from the
Rangers last season. &QL;

FLOWERS GROWS INTO LEADERSHIP  
 DEFENSIVE END DRIVEN BY DESIRE TO COMPETE, WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP TONTOZONA _ Competitive? You want competitive?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're walking down the hallway, he'll bump you so he can
have the most space,'' said Arizona State safety Willie Daniel of
his roommate, Erik Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Competitive?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ever hear me say, `It's just a game,' I'm either
talking to a kid, or I'm lying,'' the defensive end said.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's his Earl Anthony-like tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I saw this dude bowl a 300 game and I thought, `I can
do that,' '' Flowers said. ``Next thing I know, I'm buying a ball,
bag and shoes, and I'm bowling every day.''
</P>
<P>
   It is war when he plays video games. Defensive tackle Junior
Ioane's recent string of victories over Flowers in a boxing game
called ``Knockout King'' still eats at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know how bad I hate to lose,'' he said. ``When
Junior was beating me, it made me upset. I'd tell him I don't care
as he'd walk by me saying, `I got the belt. I got the belt.' But I
hated it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing I can take laid-back.''
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for ASU, which has turned to Flowers to be its
defensive leader. The promise he showed in 1998, and his commitment
in the off-season, made him a natural choice.
</P>
<P>
   Leadership was not one of the Sun Devils' strengths last season.
Flowers is not a scream-on-the-field type _ linebacker Eric Fields
has that mastered _ but he's a leader by example, from his work
ethic to his passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like the throwback of a gym rat,'' defensive line coach
Kevin Wolthausen said. ``He's in the offices all the time. He's
early for meetings. He always wants to talk football.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not one of those guys that's good at something and does
it because he's good at it. He's passionate. Sometimes's he'll come
in, sit down, not say a word and just hang out. Then he'll watch
some tape and start talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Flowers was a good player last season, and the Sun Devils
believe he can become a great one. After taking time to adjust to
ASU's system, the junior-college transfer showed significant
progress, finishing with 33 total tackles and three sacks.
</P>
<P>
   He has become someone the Sun Devils like to hold up as a
representative of their program. He is charismatic and
civic-minded, and was one of the seniors at the forefront of a
project to help refurbish a center for the homeless in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   He is diligent in his off-season training, a product of his fear
of failure and of a lesson he learned when he was 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was cutting the grass and did a terrible job. It was still
about an inch high,'' he said. ``My grandfather made me cut it
again, and after he spanked me, he sat me down and said, `There's
no point in doing something at all if you don't do it right the
first time.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kind of said, `All right, all right,' but it really set
in. After that, almost everything I did, especially in football,
I'd do it until I got it right.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few places the message didn't set in was high school.
He began skipping classes as a junior in Texas and eventually
stopped going. The subsequent 0.0 grade-point average impacted him
academically in such a way that only two small junior colleges
would take him despite a standout senior season on the football
field.
</P>
<P>
   It was to the benefit of Trinity Valley Community College in San
Antonio, which is where he was when ASU found him. His and Ioane's
potential have made it easier for some to swallow the team's
decision to bring in 14 junior-college players this season.
</P>
<P>
   There are no more signs of his lack of focus, on or off the
football field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's easy to deal with,'' equipment manager Mark Zimmer said,
``but he definitely knows what he wants. He wants things a certain
way.''
</P>
<P>
   His friends say he is equal parts intense and fun-loving.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a 21-year-old kid,'' Daniel said. ``He's playful and has
so much energy. He's smiling all the time, loves to wrestle and
tries to beat us up.''
</P>
<P>
   ````Tries,'''' said safety Al Williams, another roommate, who
practices martial arts. ``We have to work him, beat him up now and
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Flowers, ``Al provokes me. I'm like a dog minding my own
business and he comes and takes away my bone.''
</P>
<P>
   He's often looking for a video-game or bowling partner. He and
fullback Jake Each recently took on tight end Todd Heap and
linebacker Mason Unck at a local bowling alley.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were talking noise, they had never seen me play,''
Flowers said. ``We beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   His energy level is always turned on high and, unlike many of
his teammates, he won't nap between Tontozona two-a-days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I'd have to restart,'' he said. ``I can't restart.''
</P>
<P>
   Flowers hopes all his energy will help him record more sacks
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting to the quarterback is like eating peach cobbler every
Sunday,'' Flowers said. ``It's not going to always happen, but when
it does, you just want to _ ``grrrr'' _ bite into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Flowers is one dose of confidence away from being a great
player. Wolthausen has seen his growth in just one season.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times a guy wants to do the right thing, but he's
unsure and hesitant,'' Wolthausen said. ``That's the thing that
really kept Erik last year from making big plays. He'd have an
opportunity but he'd think, `Is that what I'm supposed to do?'
</P>
<P>
   ``From knowledge and experience comes the ability to see and
react without really having to think about it. And that's been the
whole development of his game: having the confidence in his ability
and his reactions so he doesn't have to think.''
</P>
<P>
   Flowers feels more confident about himself and his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 10th week of last season, we were making formation
calls and guys were still messing up,'' Flowers said. ``Here we are
the third day (of camp) and everyone's coming together. Granted,
there's still some mistakes, but everyone seems ready for the
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Challenge? That's Flowers' kind of team. &QL;

WADE TAKES STEP FORWARD  
 THRIVES ON SWITCH TO RECEIVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOUGLAS, Ariz.- In one of those textbook-like scouting reports,
Bobby Wade's first step probably has been dissected in painstaking
detail.
</P>
<P>
   But forget tiny fractions of time on an electronic stopwatch.
Wade already is beating a clock that usually defines and limits
freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   Wade has taken his first step.
</P>
<P>
   The highly recruited prospect from Desert Vista High School
asked Arizona coaches to move him from running back to receiver on
the day the Wildcats opened camp at Cochise College.
</P>
<P>
   Wade got his wish.
</P>
<P>
   One step and nine days later, he's several steps ahead of even
the most optimistic expectations Arizona had for this 18-year-old.
He's been running consistently with the first and second teams as a
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going better than I thought,'' said Wade, the 1998
Arizona Player of the Year, who still is listed as a tailback on
the Wildcats' roster. ``I didn't anticipate playing in camp as much
as I have so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as repetitions and time, it more than I expected. But
I'm still learning. I just hope to contribute and maybe make the
traveling squad.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has guaranteed Wade a seat on the plane for Arizona's
opener Aug. 28 at Penn State in a game between two teams ranked
among the nation's top five. But, at this point, it would be a
surprise if he's not on board.
</P>
<P>
   Even Arizona coach Dick Tomey, who is always cautious about
first-year college students, is talking as though he will include
Wade as often as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to play,'' said Tomey, whose club was No. 4
Saturday in the Associated Press' preseason poll. ``So far, he's
been working between the first and second groups. He wanted to see
if he could contribute at wide receiver, and so far, he's shown he
can be effective in that role.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an electrifying kind of athlete. Of all our freshmen, he
appears to have a real chance this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade's potential emergence as a sudden factor in Arizona's
promising season is a mix of good and bad news.
</P>
<P>
   First, the bad. There's some uncertainty about Arizona's
receiving corps. Dennis Northcutt is No. 1, but he has been
troubled by a slightly knee sprain. Brad Brennan is listed at No.
2, but he has been sidelined through much of camp with a hamstring
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona already had been searching for a third receiver because
of Jeremy McDaniel's departure.
</P>
<P>
   Before camp opened, Marvin Brown, a 5-foot-11 transfer from
Chabot Junior College (Hayward, Calif.), was considered a
possibility. At times, Brown's diving, sideline catches have
displayed skills that might make him a competent option for
quarterbacks Keith Smith and Ortege Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   But the range of possibilities grew by a big step when Wade took
the initiative and asked for the switch.
</P>
<P>
   With his request, there's good news. Although still untested,
Wade has shown a lot of versatility. Why let his evident talent go
untapped in a season full of the highest hopes?
</P>
<P>
   Wade was recruited as a running back, but barring injury,
there's little chance of him getting much time at a position that
belong to last year's Pacific-10 Conference rushing champion, Trung
Canidate, the senior from Central High. The backup to Canidate
figures to be the highly-touted Leo Mills, a redshirt freshman who
is recovering from a separated shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Wade saw an opportunity. So did the Arizona coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played that kind of position before,'' said Wade, 5-11,
180 pounds, who will attend his first college class later this
month. ``It's something I'm comfortable with.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona already is planning to use him on kickoff and punt
returns along with Northcutt. Both can catch and run. It's easy to
imagine the two combining on effective reverses, just as McDaniel
and Northcutt often did last year.
</P>
<P>
   Wade's potential was summed up in one sequence Saturday in a
scrimmage. On a sweep, it looked as though he might slip in the
backfield. But, in an acrobatic 360-degree twist, he regained his
balance and was gone for a big gain.
</P>
<P>
   It was two for one.
</P>
<P>
   Two first steps in one run.

BASS FISHING BEST AT NIGHT OR DAWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Fishing for bass in Arizona's desert lakes has fallen
into a consistent pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The best fishing is at night when temperatures drop, or early in
the morning and late evening when the bass still are active.
</P>
<P>
   It's just too hot during the day. Last week, when temperatures
remained cooler than normal, and the humidity dropped, was an
exception.
</P>
<P>
   I knew the humidity dropped because I could use my evaporative
cooler again and not sweat all day.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kile, a bass pro who lives in Tonto Basin, said the pattern
should remain until late September.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nights should cool off a lot,'' he said Saturday. ``The
shad will move nearer the surface, and fishing patterns will
change.''
</P>
<P>
   The top-water bite in early morning and late evening has been
best on lures such as the Zara Puppy or Spook. Soft jerk baits,
such as the Slug-Go, also have been good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here (at Roosevelt Lake), the buzzbait has become really
effective,'' Kile said. It should be at other lakes, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Night and day fishing should be best, he said, on red and purple
Westy Worms in the daytime and black ones with a yellow streak at
night. Carolina-rigged lizards in a watermelon color also are good.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Roosevelt, the right depth is 10 to 15 feet in the Salt
River arm and 15 to 25 feet in the Tonto Creek arm,'' Kile said.
``The Salt River arm has muddier water. That's why you have to fish
shallower.''
</P>
<P>
   Kile said the same patterns also should apply at other desert
lakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll probably have to fish even deeper at really clear lakes
such at Pleasant,'' Kile said. ``At more turbid lakes, like San
Carlos and Alamo, the bass should be shallower.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of September, bass should be hitting shad on the
surface all day. The shad should be shallow enough that bass can
herd them to the surface and slash them.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of top-water fishing, one of the best pieces of gear
you can carry is a pair of binoculars. At first light, when the
bass start boiling on the surface as they chase shad, binoculars
allow the angler to see those boils from a long distance.
</P>
<P>
   If fish are boiling in an area, they're likely to keep boiling
periodically. Get near the boils and shut off the outboard so you
won't spook them. Wait until they begin slashing the surface and
cast to those boils. Even if they're not boiling, the bass are
there. Just keep casting.
</P>
<P>
   Waning San Carlos Lake, which was at 4 percent of capacity, is
beginning to get needed help from monsoon rains in the White
Mountains. Runoffs from the Alpine area into the Gila River and
some from New Mexico have caused the lake to rise to 5 percent of
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   As of late last week, flow into the lake from the Gila was at
2,700 cubic feet per second, a vast improvement over the dribble it
was getting.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt, at only 31 percent of capacity, is still by far the
largest inland lake in the state at 10,631 surface acres. Pleasant,
which is at 70 percent of capacity, is the second largest with
7,886 surface acres. Alamo is third with 3,252 surface acres.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Church, who owns Bartlett Lake Marina, believes that there
are more suitable ways to judge a lake than listing its percentage
of capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are constantly being asked what is the percentage of
Bartlett Lake,'' he wrote. ``In our opinion, this question does not
really give them the answer they're looking for. In fact, it can be
somewhat misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't realize that when Bartlett is at 39 percent
(of capacity), it still covers nearly 1,500 (surface) acres. As you
know, this is several hundred acres larger than Saguaro and Canyon
(lakes, which are at at 1,184 and 724 acres, respectively, and
about 90 percent full).
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that if the surface acres were provided in the paper
rather than the percentage, it would give the recreation users a
more accurate understanding of the size of all the lakes.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an important suggestion. What do you anglers think about
it? Let me know. &QL;

   One world, two fates.
</P>
<P>
   Of children who die before their fifth birthday, 98 percent are
in the developing world. Of people who are HIV positive, some 95
percent are in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   Of the millions who die prematurely of tuberculosis, malaria,
measles, tetanus and whooping cough, all but a few thousand live in
the poor world. Indeed, tuberculosis alone kills more people each
year than lung cancer, the most prevalent cancer and the terror of
the West.
</P>
<P>
   The gap is widening between rich and poor countries, especially
between the very richest and the very poorest. Although that has
happened for a century or more, the continued early deaths of the
poor and their children are a reproach to us all.
</P>
<P>
   What is to be done to save those millions of young lives?
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that there is some new thinking about ways to
respond to this challenge. Aid agencies and drug companies are
talking to each other in more constructive ways than they once did.
</P>
<P>
   For donor countries, this is not mere altruism: as international
travel grows, rich-world governments acquire a direct interest in
halting diseases such as tuberculosis, which may otherwise infect
their own citizens.
</P>
<P>
   But affordable drugs are only part of the cure.
Developing-country governments can do more to improve the health of
their people than simply getting hold of western money and
ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the new thinking lies in the application of economics to
what has too often been a purely emotional pitch for aid. Since it
published an influential report on health in 1993, the World Bank
has consistently advanced the argument that unhealthy countries are
condemned to slow growth.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that ill health reinforces poverty is less familiar
than the view that poverty causes ill health, but equally true.
</P>
<P>
   However, one of the main virtues of the World Bank's argument is
that it allows multinational aid donors to talk straight to
developing-country finance ministers, who typically have more clout
in the allocation of resources than do their colleagues in the
health ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Now, economists are tackling _ or struggling with _ another
aspect of the health of the poor: their lack of access to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economist, has drawn attention to the
scale of the problem: poor countries cannot afford expensive
medicines, and drug companies naturally tend to focus their
research on finding cures for the ills of the rich rather than the
afflictions of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Americans and Europeans rarely suffer from schistosomiasis,
which afflicts 200 million people worldwide, or lymphatic
filariasis, which makes life miserable for another 120 million. So
the market is said to be too small to attract research.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days when Jonas Salk refused to patent polio
vaccine, saying that to do so would be ``like patenting the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   When a drug company spends millions to develop a vaccine, it
wants an economic return. The machinery that might guarantee such a
return is now taking shape.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank, the World Health Organization and other
do-gooding bodies have formed alliances with the pharmaceutical
industry to promote research on affordable drugs for neglected
tropical ailments. Legislation under consideration in the American
Congress and to be proposed by the European Commission would also
give a helping hand.
</P>
<P>
   All this talk still needs to be backed by money, though. Others
need to emulate Bill Gates's medical philanthropy. Important though
such initiatives are, they are not enough to heal the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable fall in mortality rates in Europe and North
America a century ago owed little to drugs and almost everything to
improved nutrition and better public health arrangements: reliable
water supplies, safe drains, regular garbage collection.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one in six of the world's people lack safe drinking water;
most of the giant cities of Africa and Asia have no sewerage
system; and garbage collection is so disorganized that between a
third and half of their garbage lies uncollected.
</P>
<P>
   The main answers lie in making local government more efficient
and more accountable. Another is money _ although appropriate
technology can cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   It is quicker to help the poor by ensuring that the water
sellers on whom they rely have access to safe water than by
struggling to install expensive piped supplies to the home; and
wiser to arrange for septic tanks to be emptied promptly than to
build waterborne sewerage systems.
</P>
<P>
   With some of the diseases that kill the poor, the surest answer
is to change habits.
</P>
<P>
   No single change would save more lives than if people routinely
washed their hands before touching food. They need, too, to filter
what they drink, to feed babies hygienically, to use mosquito nets,
to avoid drunken driving _ and to practice safe sex.
</P>
<P>
   One success story is sex education in Senegal: along with condom
distribution and prompt treatment of other sexually transmitted
diseases, this has helped to keep HIV infection rates in Dakar
below 2 percent, compared with 20 percent in Kenya's Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Spreading such messages needs government enthusiasm. But
education ministers may not think it their job to teach personal
hygiene, while politicians may prefer building hospitals to
preaching the virtues of hand-washing.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, good health care also entails reorganizing national
systems so that they concentrate on primary care for the poor,
rather than five-star clinics for those, like the president and his
cronies, who ought to pay for their own care.
</P>
<P>
   Even drug-buying could be done more effectively. Poor-country
governments need to make existing cheap medicines, such as oral
rehydration salts and childhood vaccines, more available.
</P>
<P>
   They also need to care better for those drugs they get: all too
often part of the consignment ends up on the black market or
spoiled by bad storage. Foreign aid for malarial drugs in Kenya was
recently withdrawn by donors exasperated by corruption, inertia and
political chicanery.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the rub. As Professor Sachs says, getting good
government is not the whole answer. But of all the ills that kill
the poor, none is as lethal as bad government. &QL;

   Bill Gates quaffs Diet Coke like James Bond sips dry martinis.
But Microsoft, the world's most valuable company, and Coca-Cola,
the most valuable global consumer brand, have more in common than
the planet's most valuable bladder.
</P>
<P>
   Both have fallen foul of a new wave of antitrust activism. A
verdict is awaited in the lengthy court battle between Microsoft
and America's Department of Justice (and various states).
</P>
<P>
   As for Coca-Cola, antitrust objections in Europe, Australia and
Mexico recently prompted the Atlanta-based fizz-maker to scale down
by half its acquisition of assorted brands from Cadbury-Schweppes.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, the European Commission has said it is
investigating Coca-Cola and the firms that bottle and distribute
its brands, for allegedly abusing a dominant position in Germany,
Denmark and Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Now, an unpublished report by Italy's competition authority
concludes that Coca-Cola has committed a ``grave violation'' of
antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, both Microsoft and Coca-Cola protest their innocence.
Windows is the operating system used in most of the world's
personal computers. Coca-Cola's various brands (the ``real thing,''
plus Fanta, Sprite and a few others) account for 51 percent of
global carbonated soft-drink sales.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the two firms claim to operate in fiercely competitive
markets. Microsoft says it faces intense competition from other
operating systems (actual and potential), older versions of Windows
already in use, and piracy. It has less than 10 percent of world
software revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Coca-Cola says it has a paltry 2 percent share of the
liquids poured down people's throats. That puts it well behind
rivals such as water, tea and fruit juice.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, both Microsoft and Coca-Cola grew into big,
profitable corporations largely because they were better at
competing than their rivals were. That sort of competition brings
welcome energy and innovation.
</P>
<P>
   But how should the two firms behave towards competitors now that
they are successful? The answer, it turns out, involves more art
than science.
</P>
<P>
   Reasonable economists can usually disagree on the proper way to
define the relevant market in which to assess the degree of power
exercised by a firm.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, to prove market power usually requires evidence that
it would be hard for a more efficient rival to capture market
share; and evidence, too, that the incumbent has the ability to
raise prices significantly _ say by 5 percent _ and keep them there
for a longish period of time, say a year.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's and Coca-Cola's broad definition of their markets is
clearly self-serving, but cannot be dismissed out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   In Pepsi, Coca-Cola faces a big, aggressive competitor.
Microsoft operates in a rapidly changing business, where past
innovation has undermined apparently dominant firms. Even so,
analysis presented in the Microsoft trial, and to the Italian
investigation of Coca-Cola, suggest that both do enjoy a degree of
market power.
</P>
<P>
   Because the evidence is finely balanced, the authorities are
right to focus on the most egregious aspects of the way the two
firms treat their rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wants to stop Coca-Cola battling Pepsi. The Department of
Justice has not tried to stop Microsoft pitting its Internet
Explorer browser against Netscape's Navigator. It merely wants
Microsoft to include Netscape Navigator alongside Explorer on its
Windows system.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates has compared this to ``telling Coca-Cola to include
three cans of Pepsi in every six-pack.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, to do that would be absurd. However, the analogy is
misleading. A better parallel would be a requirement that consumers
be given ready access to Pepsi as well as to Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Is that so absurd? Strikingly, in most of the countries in which
Coca-Cola and its bottlers are under investigation, it is accused
of trying to stop retailers (and wholesalers) making Pepsi
available.
</P>
<P>
   It is allegedly doing this through a mixture of financial
incentives and bullying _ possible because in these countries Coke
has a much higher market share than it does in America where Coke
and Pepsi are fairly evenly matched.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Microsoft nor Coca-Cola has offered any compelling
economic arguments for depriving consumers of the chance to choose
easily between their product and its main rival. That is why, on
balance, both deserve to lose. After all, the burden of proof in
such cases should lie on those who wish to be allowed to deprive
consumers of reasonable choices.
</P>
<P>
   If the Microsoft and Coke cases establish that as a principle,
celebrate by cracking open the fizzy stuff. And no, that need not
mean Diet Coke &QL;

Rockets seek relief from discomforts of offseason
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JONATHAN FEIGEN
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Winter was nice. Not too cool, not too hot. Scottie Pippen used
to laugh about the temperature in Chicago as he reveled in his
Houston honeymoon and the endless kindness and appreciation showed
by his new franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets were magazine cover darlings then, having romanced
and won the biggest-name free agent. They were instant contenders
for another NBA championship. The lockout was over, and every seat
was again filled. NBA players were moving to Houston suburbs like
New Yorkers retiring to Florida. Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich was
anointed the U.S. Olympics coach. The Rockets were hot again.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's just hot. The championship hopes were replaced by a
second consecutive first-round flameout. And summer has brought a
merciless run of bad news as unrelenting as the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Rockets' season ended four games into the postseason,
the franchise was rocked from a backlash of trade talks involving
center Hakeem Olajuwon. Tomjanovich later checked himself into a
hospital suffering from exhaustion and forced himself to skip his
summer USA Basketball coaching duties.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime assistant coach Bill Berry recently defected to the
Chicago Bulls, and Robert Barr, the team's 42-year-old senior
executive vice president of basketball affairs, retired, citing the
demands of his job or perhaps the length of his job title. And
Pippen, just a few months removed from exchanging vows with the
Rockets, has asked to go back to his ex.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever temptation there might be to assume a crack in the
team's foundation, Rockets officials insist none exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a coincidence of timing,'' said Carroll Dawson, Rockets
vice president of basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Added Tomjanovich: ``It's part of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a sports team, it's not like a normal business,''
Rockets owner Leslie Alexander said of the summer tumult. ``It's
very volatile. We've been very serene here compared to other teams,
except we've done big things. We brought Clyde (Drexler) in. We
brought Charles (Barkley) in. We brought Scottie in. But aside from
that, this has been a relatively serene business. But sports teams
change. Businesses might have the same 12 people for five, eight,
10 years. This business, every year you have new players. It's just
a different sort of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the summer developments do or do not indicate, Rockets
officials face other pressing matters that are likely _ in some
cases certain _ to have long-range impact on the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander is in the middle of negotiations for a new arena,
talks that he described as vital and ``not close.'' But even after
reaching an agreement with the Harris County-Houston Sports
Authority on an arena plan, there is still a referendum to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson is working to retool a roster with no salary-cap space
and little room to maneuver player salaries.
</P>
<P>
   And Tomjanovich is looking to adjust his offense to fit a team
with young, athletic talent in the backcourt, an aging frontcourt
and a superstar brought in to bridge the two suddenly seeking a
return to his past.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander is confident something will be worked out on the arena
front. He often has described a new arena as vital to the success
of the franchise, citing the revenue streams other new arenas bring
as ways to help keep up with player salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Pending the result of other referendum votes, if the Rockets do
not have a new arena by the time their Compaq Center lease ends in
2003, only they and the Orlando Magic will not play in either a new
or redesigned arena or have one on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people in this city want the Rockets to succeed and be
competitive and want the city to grow and be strong, and all those
things would happen with the new arena in town,'' Alexander said.
``It would be a great place to be. A lot of people in this town
have never been to one of the great new arenas in this country. Our
arena is like a high school gym compared to the great arenas. They
want the best, and that's what they would get with the new arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, it's no new taxes. It's not like we're coming to them
with a sales tax. They would get a great new place and great
experience. Why wouldn't they do that? But we have to make a deal
first, and we're not even close to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander said the team's recent obstacles would not affect the
momentum for a referendum. But he said Pippen's interest in
leaving, even if limited to rejoining former coach Phil Jackson, is
disappointing. Alexander was instrumental in acquiring Pippen and
said Pippen's request of a trade to the Lakers ``hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's upsetting,'' Alexander said. ``But Scottie is a
professional. He always keeps himself in great shape. If Scottie is
with the team _ and that is a big `if' _ he will be ready and will
play to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts. We made a commitment to him. I thought he made a
commitment to us. I'd like him to keep his end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alexander insists the team is not due for an overhaul, and
he believes in retooling while remaining competitive. The Rockets
were 31-19 last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always try to do what we think is the best thing to do to
win championships,'' Alexander said. ``That's our goal here. If
that time comes (to rebuild), if we think that is what should
happen, we'll do that. But right now, we don't feel that time has
come. And maybe we can stay on top and rebuild at the same time, be
a playoff team and a contender and rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've rebuilt the backcourt with young players. We have young
players on this team. We love our first-round pick, Kenny Thomas.
We have Othella (Harrington, going into his fourth season) in the
frontcourt. This team is aging, but it's not completely old. I
don't think we're at a crossroads.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pippen and Barkley have been public in their belief the
Rockets need help to contend. Many of the Western Conference
playoff teams have made moves; the Rockets have yet to sign a free
agent, and their options are dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been working,'' Tomjanovich said. ``I know it doesn't
fit anyone else's timetable. Everybody's timetable would be, `Let's
get it done now.' It doesn't always work that way in the world.
Sometimes you sign a free agent on the opening day of training
camp. It takes two to tango.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets' dance card is close to full. The addition of
Pippen's contract pushed the Rockets way over the salary cap,
leaving them with only the salary-cap exceptions of $2 million and
$1 million.
</P>
<P>
   With Olajuwon and Pippen occupying more than $29 million of the
$34 million salary cap, the Rockets' other signed players all make
roughly $2 million or less, severely limiting the Rockets' options
in trade talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still trying,'' Dawson said. ``We still have our two
exceptions. As long as there is someone out there you think would
have a chance to help your team and might accept one of those two
exceptions, you keep looking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not impossible to make deals. It's more difficult. If
you're over the cap, there's a limited number of things you can do.
I said last year, after this deal (to sign Pippen), we're over the
cap. We have two exceptions. There's the draft and in certain
instances, we can make trades. But the free agents would be coming
in on exceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent developments have not made anything easier. Rockets
officials insist they indicate nothing about the franchise or its
future, and that the developments are isolated in every way but
their timing. But that is enough to have made it a long, hot summer
with camp seven weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a very unusual year,'' Alexander said. ``The
Hakeem (trade) reaction. Rudy had physical problems. But we always
want to have a team people care about, not just another pro
basketball team, but something in their hearts they love, that
gives them great enjoyment and they associate with. This is their
team. They like how it's run, who we're involved with and they feel
proud they can support. The only thing I don't want to have happen
is for that to change, and I don't think it has because of this.''

   AMES, IOWA _ Bikers are becoming a tradition. On Aug. 14, a
leather-clad cavalcade of motorcyclists will roar up to the Iowa
State University basketball court, headed by the governor of
Wisconsin and Ben Nighthorse Campbell, a Republican senator from
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   They are Bikers for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a line of female bikers accompanied the car and the
presidential ambitions of an unknown Illinois businessman, Morry
Taylor. Now there is even an eco-friendly, homespun version of the
event, arranged by one of America's most persistent presidential
campaigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try for 200 bicyclists,'' Lamar Alexander told
the New Yorker. The caravan is going to start ``with bagels and
coffee at the Mamie Eisenhower birthplace in Boone.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the first (un)real event of America's endless
presidential campaign, the Republican straw poll in Ames, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The local campaign director of another candidate, Steve Forbes,
calls it ``Disneyland in Iowa'' (he means that as praise).
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the ten Republican hopefuls will pitch their tents
around the basketball arena and offer free barbecue, gospel
singers, movie stars, corn-on-the-cob and T-shirts in the hope of
attracting votes from registered Iowans.
</P>
<P>
   This is no government-approved election. No delegate will be
chosen, no assembly influenced. It is an opinion poll combined with
a fund-raising event for the state's Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Voters must pay $25 for the privilege of casting their ballots,
or may get the money from candidates' campaign chests.
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter two hoots? Not to Senator John McCain of Arizona,
the one hopeful to boycott the event. This enthusiast for
campaign-finance reform calls the poll a ``scam.''
</P>
<P>
   You do not have to be a Republican to vote for that party's
candidate. It was once not necessary even to be from Iowa. Some
polls were won by the expensive expedient of flying or busing in
electors from other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time we are not putting up with double voting,'' says
Kayne Robinson, the chairman of the Iowa Republicans, ``or with
people from out of state coming here to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the history of the event has been, to put it politely,
mixed. It has, for example, been a lousy predictor of voting
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's father won the poll in 1979, shortly before
Ronald Reagan became president. In the year Bush senior himself
became president, Pat Robertson, a televangelist, won the straw
poll. Last time, Phil Gramm of Texas tied with the candidate
eventually defeated for the presidency, Bob Dole. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 425) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is because Iowa, in common with every other state,
is a most atypical place.
</P>
<P>
   In myth, it is the heartland of America, a place of honest,
hard-to-fool farmers where (to quote a book on its political
culture) ``those who pursue public service are expected to serve
honestly and in the public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is 95 percent white (against 72 percent for the national
average). Voter turnout is unusually high. And the large number of
farmers means that candidates are judged on policies _ such as
support for ethanol subsidies _ that no one else cares much about. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE AT 525) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At best, the poll is one of those second- or third-order
indicators, like the acceleration rate of inflation _ a rate of
change in a rate of change.
</P>
<P>
   Formally, it is an opinion poll designed to show candidates'
strength before a vote next year in which Iowans will choose the
man or woman they want to be their party's presidential candidate.
It is therefore a poll about a vote for a party conference before
the presidential election itself: a vote about a vote about a vote
about a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this multiple reflexivity is part of what makes the poll
significant now. An event so far removed from any real ballot
nicely sums up the state of a campaign which, with 15 months to go,
lies beyond the horizon of most voters.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the poll's other function, as a fund-raiser, reflects
a stage of a campaign in which money is vital.
</P>
<P>
   Aptly, the term ``straw poll'' derives, according to William
Safire, a journalist and lexicographer, from the 17th-century
English author, John Selden, who wrote: ``Take a straw and throw it
up into the air...More solid things do not show the complexion of
the times so well.''
</P>
<P>
   So Ames still matters at least one hoot, if not the whole owl.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the candidates (except McCain) care about it very
much. Bush has spent around $1 million on the poll (including
$43,000 for the parking lot nearest the voting arena). Forbes has
spent a reputed $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   And the press will flock around, turning the poll into a grand
television event, raging before an indifferent public.
</P>
<P>
   The poll ``shouldn't be significant, but it has become so,''
says Hugh Winebrenner of Drake University, the author of the study
on Iowa politics referred to above.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the candidates and for the media this is the first real
indicator of a candidate's ability to bring out supporters. It's
clearly a contrived event, but has taken on a life of its own.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, quite a lot of people will show up: Robinson expects
10,000-35,000 to cast their votes. That is the size of a national
convention (and would garner $250,000-875,000 for his party).
</P>
<P>
   ``The straw poll is...the biggest political event in America
this year,'' says Forbes's Iowa campaign director, Steve Grubbs.
</P>
<P>
   It may just be a poll in an atypical state, but it is still an
unusually large one, ten or more times larger than the 1,000 people
canvassed for an ordinary opinion poll. ``It's the only real ballot
test this year of any kind,'' says Grubbs.
</P>
<P>
   Third, it is likely to winnow the field. ``I think the grim
reaper's going to be waiting right outside the field house for a
number of candidates,'' says Pat Buchanan, a fire-eating
protectionist who has been admiring the Reform Party (though he
denies thoughts of defecting).
</P>
<P>
   At least three hopefuls may have to pull out if they do poorly
in Iowa: Alexander, Dan Quayle, the former vice-president, and
possibly Elizabeth Dole, whose womanly gloss is fading.
</P>
<P>
   They are the people who should have appeal in the state. If they
do not do well there, they cannot do well anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, those left in the chase could pose more of a
challenge to the front-runner, George W. Bush. And that could prove
the true significance of the event. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,100. SECOND TRIM FOLLOWS TO 1,325) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The poll itself is unlikely to be the first real test of Bush.
The Texan is expected to win handsomely (indeed, it will be a
disaster for him and the Republicans if he does not do well). But
it could be the prelude to such a test.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is coasting towards a coronation. Even his enemies are
mostly being polite about him. That is helping in one way: he can
run the sort of centrist campaign needed to win a country-wide
election. But it contains a danger.
</P>
<P>
   Because he has not yet been tested nationally, there is a risk
that Republicans will crown him as their contender next year only
to discover too late that he cannot withstand the rigors of a
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the makings of the dirty war are discernible. The
leader of the Democrats in the Senate, Tom Daschle of South Dakota,
has become the first national politician to call for more scrutiny
of Bush's colorful past.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has so far refused to dignify questions like ``When
did you stop taking cocaine?'' with an answer. But this calm
silence may be hard to maintain in the heat of a long election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The real question about Iowa, therefore, is whether it will
provide Bush with a challenge. A crushing victory will not do that.
A strong showing by a few of his opponents _ or merely one _ just
might. &QL;

   AMES, IOWA _ Bikers are becoming a tradition. On Aug. 14, a
leather-clad cavalcade of motorcyclists will roar up to the Iowa
State University basketball court, headed by the governor of
Wisconsin and Ben Nighthorse Campbell, a Republican senator from
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   They are Bikers for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a line of female bikers accompanied the car and the
presidential ambitions of an unknown Illinois businessman, Morry
Taylor. Now there is even an eco-friendly, homespun version of the
event, arranged by one of America's most persistent presidential
campaigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try for 200 bicyclists,'' Lamar Alexander told
the New Yorker. The caravan is going to start ``with bagels and
coffee at the Mamie Eisenhower birthplace in Boone.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the first (un)real event of America's endless
presidential campaign, the Republican straw poll in Ames, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The local campaign director of another candidate, Steve Forbes,
calls it ``Disneyland in Iowa'' (he means that as praise).
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the ten Republican hopefuls will pitch their tents
around the basketball arena and offer free barbecue, gospel
singers, movie stars, corn-on-the-cob and T-shirts in the hope of
attracting votes from registered Iowans.
</P>
<P>
   This is no government-approved election. No delegate will be
chosen, no assembly influenced. It is an opinion poll combined with

<TEXT>
<P>
   Few things are more subject to historical revisionism than
cultural change. Everybody likes to celebrate torches being passed,
though only when he is part of the generation that is doing the
receiving.
</P>
<P>
   It is an item of faith for Hollywood's ruling caste of
baby-boomers that a glorious revolution took place in the 1970s. It
was a time when Jack had more hair, Clint rode tall and Warren's
fingertips were the things that Woody most wanted to be.
</P>
<P>
   A brash young group of directors with names like Coppola,
Scorsese and Lucas reinvigorated Tinseltown.
</P>
<P>
   Truthful historians might record a few protests from the
preceding generation about a sudden increase in violence (the
horse's head in the bed; that rather unpleasant taxi driver). But
that was simply the noise of an old scene which did not ``get it''
quietly disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   Now it seems that a similar ``youthquake'' is under way in
America's dominant medium.
</P>
<P>
   A trend which began with movies like ``Scream'' and ``I Know
What You Did Last Summer,'' and television shows such as ``Buffy
the Vampire Slayer,'' now seems unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   While Stanley Kubrick's final oeuvre, ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' was
crawling its way to $60 million at the box office, teen flicks made
for a fraction of the cost have sprinted past that number.
</P>
<P>
   The old guard at Warner Bros. has resigned; middle-aged TV
actors are being shown the door to make way for twenty-somethings
or teenagers. Rather than slyly adding years to their age on their
CVs to bestow gravitas, screenwriters now subtract a decade to
appear young.
</P>
<P>
   And now America has ``The Blair Witch Project,'' a horror
mockumentary made for $35,000, which has captured the all-important
``13-25 demographic,'' soared to the top of the box office, made
the covers of Time and Newsweek _ and could end up being the most
profitable film ever produced (in terms of return on capital).
</P>
<P>
   ``Blair Witch'' (which, alas, has nothing to do with Britain's
prime minister) is mostly shot with a handheld camera and rose to
fame via Internet chat rooms. It is the brainchild of a couple of
young directors who boast about their contempt for all that ``movie
s--- (crap).''
</P>
<P>
   If American parents wince when they hear that phrase, it will be
because it seems symptomatic not only of youth culture but of youth
in general.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Blair Witch haunts the eponymous movie, the homes of
baby-boomers are now possessed by an equally pathological figure _
``our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   When politicians talk about ``our kids,'' they either mean a
lonely alienated boy bent over a computer screen, or a teenage girl
who begins each sentence with ``like'' and is planning her first
cosmetic operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kids,'' goes the conventional wisdom, are the reason why
``American Pie,'' a film where the title became a temporary love
interest, was a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Our kids recorded that racist, sexist rap over our old Joni
Mitchell tape. Our kids vote less and smoke more than their
predecessors; they are worse at maths than Czech kids.
</P>
<P>
   And, as every documentary about ``our kids'' reminds you, they
were the killers in the classroom in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Is this fair? Worrying about children is nothing new. But the
current bout of hysteria seems particularly open to correction. The
problems begin with definition.
</P>
<P>
   When people talk about ``kids'' they now seem to mean anybody
between toddlers and early middle age; and, by infantilizing
teenagers, adults make their behavior even worse than it sometimes
is.
</P>
<P>
   As Jonathan Rauch recently argued in the National Journal, the
fuss about ``children killing children'' in the wake of Littleton
was absurd: the two killers were 18 and 17.
</P>
<P>
   Put it another way: the older ``child,'' Eric Harris, was old
enough to drive a car, vote, join the Army and (in most states) get
married _ though not old enough to buy a drink.
</P>
<P>
   Some consistent distinction needs to be made, not just in the
law but also in political debate, between genuine children and
young adults.
</P>
<P>
   Next, it is not clear from the statistics that our kids, however
you define them, are indeed getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the latest figures show that adolescent sex is
decreasing. Many of the worthiest nonpolitical groups report a
surge in young membership. And in culture at least there is the
suspicion that they are getting a bad rap.
</P>
<P>
   As James Wolcott argues in the current issue of Vanity Fair, the
present bout of virgin-seducing and slasher movies seems to be the
work of an older group of producers who have made teens this year's
``designated sinners, camera fodder for jaded appetites and
projected desires.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, he points out, something distinctly odd about Brett
Easton Ellis, the author of ``American Psycho,'' one of the most
gratuitously violent novels ever, complaining about ``teens running
roughshod over this country _ murdering, raping, gambling away the
nation's future _ and we have the bills for counselling and prison
to prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, from some angles the argument that American youth is
less responsible than its self-obsessed and self-indulgent boomer
parents seems downright laughable.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has gone on about the problems with ``our kids'' more
than the Clintons; yet their daughter Chelsea is by some way the
most dignified member of their family.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, the creation that most people bring up in the
context of kids, has so far proved for the most part a miracle of
youthful inventiveness. Even ``Blair Witch'' is not just another
slasher movie, but something recognizably different from its
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one gory moment in the whole film, which uses
psychology rather than special effects to terrify you. True, the
dialogue is a little lame: ``This is so not cool'' is hardly
Shakespearian. On the other hand, ``Goodfellas'' is not exactly
Proust.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the longer you look at ``our kids,'' the more you can
trace back the problems and any possible solutions to the
baby-boomers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, America's schools are worse than they should be, but that
is because the boomers have refused to reform them (witness the
resistance even now to the idea of mild experimentation with
vouchers).
</P>
<P>
   Yes, children do not vote, but that is because the boomers have
turned politics into a moneyed husk.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they do shoot each other, but that is because the boomers,
once so moralistic about nonviolence, have allowed gun ownership to
soar.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than worrying about ``our kids,'' the real horror movie
still seems to be ``Mom and Dad.'' &QL;

<P>
   Few things are more subject to historical revisionism than
cultural change. Everybody likes to celebrate torches being passed,
though only when he is part of the generation that is doing the
receiving.
</P>
<P>
   It is an item of faith for Hollywood's ruling caste of
baby-boomers that a glorious revolution took place in the 1970s. It
was a time when Jack had more hair, Clint rode tall and Warren's
fingertips were the things that Woody most wanted to be.
</P>
<P>
   A brash young group of directors with names like Coppola,
Scorsese and Lucas reinvigorated Tinseltown.
</P>
<P>
   Truthful historians might record a few protests from the
preceding generation about a sudden increase in violence (the
horse's head in the bed; that rather unpleasant taxi driver). But
that was simply the noise of an old scene which did not ``get it''
quietly disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   Now it seems that a similar ``youthquake'' is under way in
America's dominant medium.
</P>
<P>
   A trend which began with movies like ``Scream'' and ``I Know
What You Did Last Summer,'' and television shows such as ``Buffy
the Vampire Slayer,'' now seems unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   While Stanley Kubrick's final oeuvre, ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' was
crawling its way to $60 million at the box office, teen flicks made
for a fraction of the cost have sprinted past that number.
</P>
<P>
   The old guard at Warner Bros. has resigned; middle-aged TV
actors are being shown the door to make way for twenty-somethings
or teenagers. Rather than slyly adding years to their age on their
CVs to bestow gravitas, screenwriters now subtract a decade to
appear young.
</P>
<P>
   And now America has ``The Blair Witch Project,'' a horror
mockumentary made for $35,000, which has captured the all-important
``13-25 demographic,'' soared to the top of the box office, made
the covers of Time and Newsweek _ and could end up being the most
profitable film ever produced (in terms of return on capital).
</P>
<P>
   ``Blair Witch'' (which, alas, has nothing to do with Britain's
prime minister) is mostly shot with a handheld camera and rose to
fame via Internet chat rooms. It is the brainchild of a couple of
young directors who boast about their contempt for all that ``movie
s--- (crap).''
</P>
<P>
   If American parents wince when they hear that phrase, it will be
because it seems symptomatic not only of youth culture but of youth
in general.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Blair Witch haunts the eponymous movie, the homes of
baby-boomers are now possessed by an equally pathological figure _
``our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   When politicians talk about ``our kids,'' they either mean a
lonely alienated boy bent over a computer screen, or a teenage girl
who begins each sentence with ``like'' and is planning her first
cosmetic operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kids,'' goes the conventional wisdom, are the reason why
``American Pie,'' a film where the title became a temporary love
interest, was a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Our kids recorded that racist, sexist rap over our old Joni
Mitchell tape. Our kids vote less and smoke more than their
predecessors; they are worse at maths than Czech kids.
</P>
<P>
   And, as every documentary about ``our kids'' reminds you, they
were the killers in the classroom in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Is this fair? Worrying about children is nothing new. But the
current bout of hysteria seems particularly open to correction. The
problems begin with definition.
</P>
<P>
   When people talk about ``kids'' they now seem to mean anybody
between toddlers and early middle age; and, by infantilizing
teenagers, adults make their behavior even worse than it sometimes
is.
</P>
<P>
   As Jonathan Rauch recently argued in the National Journal, the
fuss about ``children killing children'' in the wake of Littleton
was absurd: the two killers were 18 and 17.
</P>
<P>
   Put it another way: the older ``child,'' Eric Harris, was old
enough to drive a car, vote, join the Army and (in most states) get
married _ though not old enough to buy a drink.
</P>
<P>
   Some consistent distinction needs to be made, not just in the
law but also in political debate, between genuine children and
young adults.
</P>
<P>
   Next, it is not clear from the statistics that our kids, however
you define them, are indeed getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the latest figures show that adolescent sex is
decreasing. Many of the worthiest nonpolitical groups report a
surge in young membership. And in culture at least there is the
suspicion that they are getting a bad rap.
</P>
<P>
   As James Wolcott argues in the current issue of Vanity Fair, the
present bout of virgin-seducing and slasher movies seems to be the
work of an older group of producers who have made teens this year's
``designated sinners, camera fodder for jaded appetites and
projected desires.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, he points out, something distinctly odd about Brett
Easton Ellis, the author of ``American Psycho,'' one of the most
gratuitously violent novels ever, complaining about ``teens running
roughshod over this country _ murdering, raping, gambling away the
nation's future _ and we have the bills for counselling and prison
to prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, from some angles the argument that American youth is
less responsible than its self-obsessed and self-indulgent boomer
parents seems downright laughable.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has gone on about the problems with ``our kids'' more
than the Clintons; yet their daughter Chelsea is by some way the
most dignified member of their family.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, the creation that most people bring up in the
context of kids, has so far proved for the most part a miracle of
youthful inventiveness. Even ``Blair Witch'' is not just another
slasher movie, but something recognizably different from its
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one gory moment in the whole film, which uses
psychology rather than special effects to terrify you. True, the

<P>
   CHICAGO _ A boomlet is going on in America's cities.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Brookings Institution and the Fannie Mae
Foundation examined 26 cities and found something that would have
been inconceivable a decade ago: every one of them expects its
downtown population to grow by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Houston projects that its central-city population will
quadruple; even Philadelphia, which has lost 600,000 people since
1950, foresees a 13 percent growth by 2010. Chicago expects a
whopping 32 percent jump.
</P>
<P>
   The data tell only part of the story. The survey asked about
projected population growth in and around the central business
districts. Most American cities still have deeply blighted pockets
and many are losing population overall.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of job growth is still in the suburbs, as Bruce Katz,
director of the Brookings Institution Center on Urban and
Metropolitan Policy, points out.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the most desirable parts of many American cities are
thriving, and therein lies one recipe for dealing with urban
sprawl: keep people in cities and entice suburban residents to move
back.
</P>
<P>
   Why are more Americans abandoning their love affair with
far-flung suburbs and shopping malls?
</P>
<P>
   Demographics is one reason. Young professionals are marrying and
having children later, allowing them to live in the city longer
before buying a minivan and moving out.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, ``empty nesters,'' couples who no longer have
children living at home, are rediscovering the appeal of urban
life. Indeed, the very excesses of the suburbs _ big houses on big
plots _ make them less attractive for older couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who don't want to mow yards,'' says Paul
Helmke, mayor of Fort Wayne, Ind., and former head of the country's
Conference of Mayors.
</P>
<P>
   Urban living also has a new lustre because crime has plummeted.
``People will not expose themselves to danger,'' says John
Norquist, mayor of Milwaukee and author of ``The Wealth of
Cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee has not had a single homicide downtown in seven years.
The ten largest American cities have seen an average drop in
violent crime of 34 percent since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Brown, a perennial Californian politician, once called
America's incarceration binge ``a strategy to control the surplus
population in a capitalist system that is breaking down.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has been elected mayor of Oakland and is trying to
turn the city around, he has a different view. He told the Wall
Street Journal recently that more criminals must go to jail and
stay there.
</P>
<P>
   The labor market has also changed the urban-suburban dynamic.
Companies fled to the suburbs on the assumption that an endless
supply of white-collar workers would find their way to the office,
wherever it happened to be.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, urban planners pronounced that technology would
render the density of cities obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Both those assumptions have proved wrong, particularly in the
high-tech industry. Silicon Valley is proof that there is an
advantage to being close to customers, suppliers and other firms in
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   As for workers, the young programmers and executives who make up
the information-technology sector prefer an urban lifestyle that is
only a skateboard-ride away from the office.
</P>
<P>
   Ubid, an on-line auction company, has announced plans to move
its headquarters from a suburb outside Chicago back into the city
to ``attract the right kind of talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers everywhere have made it clear that they are tired of
sitting in traffic on their way to offices that are nowhere near
public transport.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, cities have rediscovered their comparative advantage:
they are the natural hub of culture, the arts, good dining, sports
and entertainment. Successful downtowns are ``24-hour cities,''
says Katz. ``These are fun places to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, developers who have made a fortune building subdivisions
on farmland now smell a profit in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee has built 2,000 new housing units downtown in the past
three years. Mayor Norquist tells the story (admiringly) of a
developer who bought a downtown warehouse for $1 million, turned it
into 40 apartments, and sold all of them for $500,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago issued more than 25,000 residential and commercial
building permits in 1998, up from 10,000 in 1993. The price of
existing houses in Lincoln Park, one of the city's best
neighborhoods, has climbed 26 percent in two years.
</P>
<P>
   This is sustainable, market-driven development, says Katz. But
in many cases, he points out, the government made the first

<P>
   CHICAGO _ A boomlet is going on in America's cities.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Brookings Institution and the Fannie Mae
Foundation examined 26 cities and found something that would have
been inconceivable a decade ago: every one of them expects its
downtown population to grow by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Houston projects that its central-city population will
quadruple; even Philadelphia, which has lost 600,000 people since
1950, foresees a 13 percent growth by 2010. Chicago expects a
whopping 32 percent jump.
</P>
<P>
   The data tell only part of the story. The survey asked about
projected population growth in and around the central business
districts. Most American cities still have deeply blighted pockets
and many are losing population overall.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of job growth is still in the suburbs, as Bruce Katz,
director of the Brookings Institution Center on Urban and
Metropolitan Policy, points out.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the most desirable parts of many American cities are
thriving, and therein lies one recipe for dealing with urban
sprawl: keep people in cities and entice suburban residents to move
back.
</P>
<P>
   Why are more Americans abandoning their love affair with
far-flung suburbs and shopping malls?
</P>
<P>
   Demographics is one reason. Young professionals are marrying and
having children later, allowing them to live in the city longer
before buying a minivan and moving out.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, ``empty nesters,'' couples who no longer have
children living at home, are rediscovering the appeal of urban
life. Indeed, the very excesses of the suburbs _ big houses on big
plots _ make them less attractive for older couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who don't want to mow yards,'' says Paul
Helmke, mayor of Fort Wayne, Ind., and former head of the country's
Conference of Mayors.
</P>
<P>
   Urban living also has a new lustre because crime has plummeted.
``People will not expose themselves to danger,'' says John
Norquist, mayor of Milwaukee and author of ``The Wealth of
Cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee has not had a single homicide downtown in seven years.
The ten largest American cities have seen an average drop in
violent crime of 34 percent since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Brown, a perennial Californian politician, once called
America's incarceration binge ``a strategy to control the surplus
population in a capitalist system that is breaking down.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has been elected mayor of Oakland and is trying to
turn the city around, he has a different view. He told the Wall
Street Journal recently that more criminals must go to jail and
stay there.
</P>
<P>
   The labor market has also changed the urban-suburban dynamic.
Companies fled to the suburbs on the assumption that an endless
supply of white-collar workers would find their way to the office,
wherever it happened to be.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, urban planners pronounced that technology would
render the density of cities obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Both those assumptions have proved wrong, particularly in the
high-tech industry. Silicon Valley is proof that there is an
advantage to being close to customers, suppliers and other firms in
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   As for workers, the young programmers and executives who make up
the information-technology sector prefer an urban lifestyle that is
only a skateboard-ride away from the office.
</P>
<P>
   Ubid, an on-line auction company, has announced plans to move
its headquarters from a suburb outside Chicago back into the city
to ``attract the right kind of talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers everywhere have made it clear that they are tired of
sitting in traffic on their way to offices that are nowhere near
public transport.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, cities have rediscovered their comparative advantage:
they are the natural hub of culture, the arts, good dining, sports
and entertainment. Successful downtowns are ``24-hour cities,''
says Katz. ``These are fun places to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, developers who have made a fortune building subdivisions
on farmland now smell a profit in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee has built 2,000 new housing units downtown in the past
three years. Mayor Norquist tells the story (admiringly) of a
developer who bought a downtown warehouse for $1 million, turned it
into 40 apartments, and sold all of them for $500,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago issued more than 25,000 residential and commercial
building permits in 1998, up from 10,000 in 1993. The price of
existing houses in Lincoln Park, one of the city's best
neighborhoods, has climbed 26 percent in two years.
</P>
<P>
   This is sustainable, market-driven development, says Katz. But
in many cases, he points out, the government made the first
investments that later attracted private capital.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee spent $9 million to build a riverside walk that had
been designed in 1904 by a famous urban architect but never
constructed; the project spawned $50 million in private
development.
</P>
<P>
   Brookings has promulgated a list of ``10 steps towards a living
downtown.'' Most of the suggestions are common sense: save historic
buildings, protect open space, make housing a priority, put things
such as athletic stadiums and museums downtown.
</P>
<P>
   But what about families with children? Cities have the potential
to be child-friendly, says Norquist. They are designed around
blocks with pavements; they can support museums, libraries, parks.
</P>
<P>
   But schools matter more than any of that. Milwaukee has a
path-breaking school-choice program, but only poorer residents can
take part. Norquist would like to see those income caps lifted
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   A number of mayors, including Richard Daley in Chicago and
Dennis Archer in Detroit, have wrested control over their schools
away from independent school boards in the hope that reforms will
keep middle-class residents from leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these systems have made impressive gains, but better is
not necessarily good enough for keen parents.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Park High School, one of the best public high schools in
Chicago, offers 13 advanced placement courses (classes that allow
bright students to work towards college credit). New Trier, a

<P>
   KATHMANDU _ The recruitment of Gurkhas by the British army has
long provided a tough but lucrative job for some people in the
hills of Nepal with unproductive land and no other source of
employment.
</P>
<P>
   Harka Gurung, a former government minister in Nepal, recalls
that his father could educate four of his children on his pension
of 75 rupees (less than Pounds1 these days) that he received for
his 21 years of service in the British army. His father retired in
1926.
</P>
<P>
   There are many like Gurung who could not have attended school,
let along entered the professions, without their father's pension.
But what seemed a fair deal in the old days may not seem so fair
now.
</P>
<P>
   The service of Gurkhas in the British army dates back to 1817.
Their bravery in numerous battles has brought fame to themselves
and to Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   When the British left the Indian subcontinent in 1947, they
continued to employ Gurkhas. Britain created a special status for
them in its army, which protected them from being regarded as
mercenaries, a sensitive matter for Gurkhas.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, a number of retired Gurkhas sought to draw
attention to the fact that Gurkha pay had fallen behind that of
other soldiers in the British army. But in the days of Nepal's
absolute monarchy nothing was done to further their claims. Those
who protested were often jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the establishment of multi-party democracy in Nepal in
1990, the campaign has been revived. At its head are two groups,
the Nepal Ex-Servicemen's Association and the more radical Gurkha
Ex-Servicemen's Organization (GESO).
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has had some success. In 1997, the British
government raised the Gurkhas' pay to that of other soldiers. But
their pension remains far lower than a British soldier's.
</P>
<P>
   GESO wants Gurkhas who have served in the British army to get
pension rights equal to other British soldiers. It also seeks
employment opportunities for Gurkhas' children in Britain, and for
Gurkha ex-soldiers to be allowed to work there.
</P>
<P>
   The British say that the formula used for working out the Gurkha
pension was laid down in the treaty it signed with Nepal and India
in 1947, which was based on Indian army rates. That treaty is still
in existence, and Britain seems disinclined to update it.
</P>
<P>
   The British also observe that living costs in Nepal are low
compared with those in Britain and other rich countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``But things are different now,'' says Harka Gurung. The 1947
agreement was drawn in haste, he believes, and was only temporary
in nature. The agreement should be scrapped or renegotiated, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   The death in June of two Gurkha officers who were defusing bombs
in Kosovo, the first NATO casualties of its peacekeeping operation,
has added strength to their campaign for better pensions.
</P>
<P>
   The widow of one of the officers has been much interviewed by
British newspapers. It has been pointed out that, had her husband
been a British soldier, she would have received a lump sum of more
than Pounds64,000 ($103,000) and an annual pension of about
Pounds15,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Nepali widow has received Pounds19,000 and a pension of
Pounds940, which under present rules will be reduced after five
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Gurkhas blame the Nepali government even more than the
British for not pressing their claim. But government in Nepal has
been in a wobbly state for years.
</P>
<P>
   Both the ruling Congress party and members of the opposition
have in fact spoken in support of the Gurkhas' case. Backing the
Gurkhas, who are well regarded in Nepal, wins votes. But perhaps
their voices have not carried weight in London.
</P>
<P>
   Militant-minded Gurkhas point out that there are some 30,000
former Gurkha soldiers in Nepal. What would happen if they took up
arms against the government, as have the Maoist guerrillas who have
fought in the border country for years?
</P>
<P>
   A more rational suggestion being canvassed by former Gurkhas is
that they should bypass their own government, and file a legal
claim for better pensions against the British government in London.
</P>
<P>
   The Gurkhas, however, first plan to parade and thunder through
the streets of Kathmandu in September, hoping to catch the
attention of the world.
</P>
<P>
   They are organizing an international conference in Kathmandu
starting on Sept. 18, which they say will highlight their unfair
treatment by the British government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be the biggest ever gathering of the Gurkhas,'' says
GESO's president, Padam Bahadur Gurung, who is under attack in his
movement for its lack of success. &QL;

WILLIAMS BACKS UP TALK, BEATS HINGIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ All week, Serena Williams seemed bent
on hyperbole. First, she said if she played more tournaments, she'd
be No. 1 in the world. Then, she boasted that she didn't care who
her opponents were, even if the list included Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   Those exaggerations didn't look off base Saturday night.
Williams beat Martina Hingis 6-3, 7-5 in 1 hour, 9 minutes in the
Acura Classic semifinals at Manhattan Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Williams never lost serve and broke Hingis twice. She looked on
top of her game against the No. 1 player in the world. She had 38
winners to Hingis' eight. Williams was asked if anyone could have
beaten her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anyone,'' she said. ``Nope. Nope.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams will face Julie Halard-Decugis in the final.
Halard-Decugis upset top seed Lindsay Davenport 6-3, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   In the second set, Williams broke Hingis' serve to take a 6-5
lead. Hingis placed balls well, repeatedly making the No. 6 seed
sprint across court. But Hingis finally hit wide on match point.
What could Hingis have done to get a winner?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few people who could get the ball by me,''
Williams said. ``You should ask them what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first set, Williams broke Hingis in the fourth game with
a winner down the line. Hingis had two break points in the seventh
game. But Williams delivered two of her seven aces to ward off
Hingis, who despite the loss, said Serena's older sister, Venus, is
the more consistent player.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't play like this every day, otherwise she'd be the
better one,'' Hingis said. ``Serena was all pumped up in this
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis beat Venus Williams, ranked fourth in the world, last
week in the finals of the TIG Classic in San Diego. Serena
Williams, ranked 11th, got revenge for the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never beat both of them in a row,'' Hingis said. ``It's
always that I'd lose to the other the next time. It's funny.''
</P>
<P>
   What really might have helped Williams was not playing singles
since the French Open. Her legs and demeanor appeared rejuvenated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost impossible for a player to win two straight, or
three in a row,'' said Hingis. ``There are always other players who
are there that are fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 17, showed more poise than when she lost in the
quarterfinals of the Acura Classic the past two years. Williams,
who is 2-3 against Hingis, did have 22 unforced errors, but her
winners made up for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A younger Serena would have lost her serve in the final game,
lost control and maybe even thrown her racket,'' Williams said.
``I've eradicated that Serena and she's out of here.''

PEE WEE REESE DIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Pee Wee Reese, captain of the Brooklyn Dodgers'
fabled ``Boys of Summer,'' never played with Don Sutton. But when
the Hall of Fame right-hander was to have his number retired at
Dodger Stadium last August, Reese was the first person he asked to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   To Sutton and several generations of fans, Reese embodied the
tradition of the National League's most storied franchise, a Hall
of Fame shortstop who died Saturday in Louisville, Ky. at the age
of 81 _ one year to the day after he came to honor Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a cornerstone of this organization and to everyone who
ever put on the Dodger uniform,'' Sutton said. ``There are a lot of
us who will be forgotten as the years pass, but there are three
names that will always be remembered: Sandy Koufax, Jackie Robinson
and Pee Wee Reese.''
</P>
<P>
   Born Harold Henry Reese, he played just one season in Los
Angeles, ending (in 1958) an 18-year career that included nine
All-Star games, seven pennants and Brooklyn's only World Series
title in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   But Reese left a lasting memory in 1959 when he wheeled Roy
Campanella to home plate in front of 93,103 emotional fans at the
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years later, Reese's respect and appreciation for his old
teammates was remembered throughout the game. He was hailed as a
champion during baseball's difficult integration in the late 1940s,
when he put aside Southern stereotypes and befriended rookie
second-baseman Jackie Robinson as he was breaking baseball's color
barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Reese set an example for acceptance by putting his arm around
Robinson during a game that was getting ugly at Cincinnati's
Crosley Field, a quiet gesture that resonated throughout the league
and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Don Newcombe, who later won a Cy Young Award, remembered that
Reese's compassion was equal to his competitive fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad, sad day,'' said Newcombe, now a member of the
Dodgers community relations department. ``I miss him as much as I
miss Jackie Robinson or Roy Campanella, because he was such a good
and sincere man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pee Wee was one of the guys on the Dodgers who we, I mean the
black guys, could look to for leadership. Jackie would tell us who
the nice guys were and who wasn't. And Pee Wee was surely one of
the nice guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Reese, inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1984, was busy after
his baseball career, working for Louisville Slugger and
broadcasting with CBS, NBC and the Cincinnati Reds. He was a
frequent visitor to the Dodgers spring training camp in Vero Beach,
Fla., including the 40th anniversary celebration in 1995 of
Brooklyn's only championship.
</P>
<P>
   Reese had battled illness in recent years, overcoming prostate
and lung cancer. During his bout with lung cancer in 1977 he
underwent radiation treatment after doctors removed a malignant
tumor. He also was recovering from a broken hip at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a difficult time for all of us,'' Newcombe said. ``But
Pee Wee was in a lot of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Reese is survived by his wife since 1942, Dorothy, and son Mark.
</P>
<P>
   Flags at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles were flown at half-staff
for Saturday night's game against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Although Robinson, Campanella and Don Drysdale are gone, there
are a number of players from that 1955 team who are alive: Koufax,
Newcombe, pitchers Carl Erskine, Clem Labine Billy Loes, Joe Black,
Ed Roebuck and Johnny Podres; infielder Don Zimmer, center fielder
Duke Snider and an unknown left-hander named Tom Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the captain and he'll always be the captain,'' said
Lasorda, who went on to manage the Dodgers for 20 years and reach
the Hall of Fame. ``He was a great leader. We loved him very, very
much. Pee Wee was a Hall of Famer as a ballplayer, but more
importantly he was a Hall of Famer as a person. There isn't anyone
who played for the Dodgers who didn't love Pee Wee Reese.''
</P>
<P>
   Reese's short stature (5-foot-10, 160 pounds) and
self-deprecating nature belied his fierce competitiveness. But a
man who served a three-year stint in the Navy during World War II
became a perfect symbol for the Brooklyn Dodgers, who despite seven
trips to the World Series, were always viewed as underdogs to the
crosstown New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Six times they lost to the Yankees, which resulted in the
rallying cry, ``Wait Till Next Year.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers were an immensely talented team that included
six future Hall of Famers, nine if you count manager Walter Alston
and broadcasters Vin Scully and Red Barber. But Reese, who came up
in 1940, was the unqualified leader, guiding the Dodgers to the
pennant in 1941, their first since 1920.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first met him, I was so much in awe,'' Scully said.
``He was the heart and soul of the `Boys of Summer.' If a players
needed to be consoled, Pee Wee would console him. If a player
needed to be kicked in the fanny, Pee Wee would do that, too. If a
player really needed a friend, Pee Wee was there for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Reese was the National League's premier shortstop, playing in
New York, the center of the baseball universe that also had the
Yankees' Phil Rizzuto and the Giants' Alvin Dark.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the Dodgers leadoff hitter, leading the league in
walks (104) in 1947, runs scored (132) in 1949 and stolen bases
(30) in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Reese compiled a .269 lifetime batting average and is first
among Dodgers in walks (1,210) and runs (1,338).
</P>
<P>
   He was at his best in the World Series. In 1955, the Dodgers
went to a seventh game against the mighty Yankees and Reese
provided the spark. Reese fielded a ground ball for the final out
of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We began to think we could never beat the Yankees,'' Newcombe
said. ``Then on that day in the clubhouse, Pee Wee said. `It looks
like we can beat these guys and show them that we can do it. Today
is the day we can do it.' ''

HUNDLEY TO SWITCH HIS SWITCH-HITTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Todd Hundley batted left-handed against
Atlanta left-hander Bruce Chen in the fifth inning Saturday night,
it marked the beginning of an experiment to move the switch-hitting
catcher to the left side only.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley bounced into a force play on a check swing against Chen.
But for the final seven weeks of the season he is expected to bat
lefty against left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, who will probably be rested tonight against Braves
left-hander Tom Glavine, discussed the experiment with manager
Davey Johnson during a meeting Thursday and received Johnson's
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley has been hampered by soreness in his right wrist, which
was surgically repaired several years ago. It has affected his
swing and his numbers from the right side. He entered Saturday's
game with just four hits in 40 at-bats from the right side. All 17
of his home runs have come from the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it and I don't see a problem,'' Johnson said.
``It is something I want him to think about, but I don't think he
needs to make a decision until spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley has been monitoring the progress of San Francisco first
baseman J.T. Snow, who has played well this season after abandoning
switch-hitting.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Johnson managed Roberto Alomar in Baltimore when
the Orioles switch-hitting second baseman batted strictly from the
right side due to an injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of an injury, I understand,'' Johnson said.
``Robbie did not have a problem with it. But I hope Todd does not
give up the idea of switch-hitting altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Young out: Johnson gave second baseman Eric Young Saturday
night off after Young played Friday for the first time in 18 games.
Young, sidelined by a variety of leg and ankle problems, reported
no discomfort Saturday, but the manager thought it best to ease him
back into action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him in the whirlpool and he said he was fine,'' Johnson
said. ``But I'm sure he was a little stiff. I mean, he hadn't
played in almost three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, who has been derailed by injuries the past two seasons,
reached base three times in Friday's 7-3 loss to Atlanta. He also
stole his 35th base.

DODGERS SHUT DOWN ATLANTA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the absence of any real playoff possibility,
Kevin Brown vs. John Smoltz in front of a sellout crowd Saturday
night at Dodger Stadium was a great consolation gift.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that a three-run homer by Todd Hollandswoth and 53,533
fans who wanted to cheer more than boo Raul Mondesi, and the Los
Angeles Dodgers' 8-1 victory over the Atlanta Braves was a solid
effort from a team that was expected to do this from opening day.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was masterful, winning his fifth consecutive game by
limiting the Braves to four hits in seven scoreless innings. He
outpitched Smoltz, the former Cy Young Award winner, who was forced
to leave the game in the sixth inning with a sore right groin.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (14-6) sailed through the middle innings, retiring 13 of
final 14 batters he faced before giving way to Alan Mills to begin
the eighth inning. The Braves scored their only run in the ninth
when Andruw Jones opened with his 23rd home run, off left-hander
Pedro Borbon.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was rewarded with an exciting effort by the Dodgers
offense. They ignited the club's sixth victory in eight games.
During the seventh inning, Mondesi and Todd Hundley pulled a double
steal and Mondesi later scored. For a moment the crowd did not boo
Mondesi, who has come under fire since blasting management last
Wednesday in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the mood was festive. The Dodgers' 11th sellout of the
season was sparked by a lunch-box giveaway. It didn't hurt that the
Dodgers were facing the league's top team. The Dodgers, who are now
in third place in the National League West, 13 games behind
Arizona, knocked Atlanta back into a tie for first with the New
York Mets in the East.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers took a 3-0 lead into the sixth inning after scoring
two in the fourth against Smoltz. Eric Karros, who is white hot
with runners in scoring position (9 for 13 in the last 11 games),
opened the inning with a double to right center, his 34th of the
season. Karros moved to third on a single by Hundley and scored on
a fielder's choice by Adrian Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, who hit his 13th homer in Friday's loss, then stole his
13th base. He scored on a single by second baseman Greg Counsell,
playing after manager Davey Johnson decided to rest Eric Young, who
just came off the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers added a run in the fifth when Hollandsworth, playing
center in place of Devon White, reached on a fielder's choice, took
third on the second of three hits by Gary Sheffield and scored on a
single by Karros.
</P>
<P>
   The RBI was Karros's 83rd of the season. His career high is 111
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   When Mondesi followed with a single, Smoltz walked off with
mound. He first injured his groin pitching to Counsell in the
fourth inning, when Braves manager Bobby Cox brought his trainer to
the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz, who has been on the disabled list twice this season with
elbow problems, is listed as day to day.
</P>
<P>
   He was long gone by time Hollandsworth came to the plate in the
eighth with Mark Grudzielanek and Jose Vizcaino aboard. The pitcher
was the Braves' highly touted left-hander Bruce Chen, whom the
Dodgers sought in trade talks during July.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth doesn't usually face left-handers, but he launched
a 1-1 pitch into the right field stands for his seventh home run. &UR;  &QL;

 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a secret war. At least 500 Anglo-American air strikes
against Iraq this year. More than a hundred dead. Well over a
thousand sorties. And yet scarcely a headline.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we have become immune to NATO bombing in Yugoslavia.
Allied jets bombed Iraq again over the past fortnight. Eight dead
on July 29, nine dead the following day, according to the Iraqis.
And yet each British or American raid produces little more than a
paragraph in the western press. There is no political debate in
Washington, no questions in the House of Commons in London.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing Iraq has become routine, an ``acceptable'' war. In the
first five weeks of this year, there were 70 air strikes against
Iraq, inflicting more damage than the pre-Christmas ``Desert Fox''
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Americans and British received new rules of
engagement _ to attack Iraqi military installations even if they
were not directly threatening the RAF or the U.S. Air Force _ the
bombings went on unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   Yet eight months later, President Saddam Hussein's vicious
regime appears to be as impregnable as ever.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubting the facts of the air strikes. On Feb. 1,
U.S. and British aircraft attacked an Iraqi missile site and two
``communications sites'' at Al-Amarah and Talil.
</P>
<P>
   On March 1, American jets _ in one of the heaviest raids on Iraq
in two months _ dropped more than thirty 2,000-lb. and 500-lb.
laser-guided bombs on ``communication sites, radio relay sites and
anti-aircraft artillery sites'' near Mosul ``in response to radar
threats.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi oil pipelines were bombed, provoking condemnation from the
U.N.'s ``oil-for-food'' program director in Baghdad, Benon Sevan.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Iraq claimed that bombs had been dropped on a
farm near Basra. By March 14, Allied spokesmen were reporting ``an
unspecified number of bombs'' dropped on ``Iraqi radar posing a
threat to coalition aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   While NATO was bombing Yugoslavia, Iraq experienced a brief lull
in bombing. By April 5 _ at the height of the bombardment on
Yugoslavia, the raids on Iraq had recommenced.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman announced that an American F-16CG aircraft,
a U.S. Navy F/A-18 Hornet and an RAF Tornado had attacked
surface-to-air missiles sites 110 miles south of Baghdad while
other planes had bombed ``communication sites'' near al-Salman and
Nukayeb.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks later, Iraq said two people were killed when
planes bombed surface-to-air sites south of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The Anglo-American offensive has infuriated both the Russians
and the French _ again with little reporting or public reaction.
</P>
<P>
   The French were deeply troubled when an American AGM-130 missile
exploded in a Basra housing complex in February, killing 17 people
and wounding almost 100, according to the United Nations. Six women
and 10 children were among the dead.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman said _ in words that would become familiar
during the NATO bombardment of Yugoslavia two months later _ that
``we are not targeting civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on Feb. 4, when the Americans claimed that British and U.S.
aircraft had destroyed 40 missile batteries, not a single
dissenting voice was heard in Congress or the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
   On May 8, Iraq said that three people had been killed when 18
bombs were dropped on Iraqi ``civilian and military (sic)
targets.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 12, Iraq said 12 people had been killed in civilian areas
of Mosul after U.S. and British aircraft had fired air-to-ground
missiles at farmers' tents around the ancient city of Ninevah. By
the end of the month, the Americans were recording attacks on
``Iraqi air defenses near Mosul.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware that Saddam Hussein was an even more brutal man than
Serbia's president-cum-ethnic-cleanser Slobodan Milosevic, it was
inevitable that the U.S. government would use the same mantra to
excuse civilian casualties in Iraq as it had in Yugoslavia, where
all ``collateral damage'' was blamed upon Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, on July 19, James Rubin, the State Department
spokesman, said that ``every effort is taken to avoid any
casualties to civilians... Ultimate responsibility for these events
(sic), however, lies with Saddam Hussein.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other disturbing parallels with the NATO bombardment
of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO said it was bombing the Serbs because they were
``ethnically cleansing'' hundreds of thousands of Albanians from
Kosovo _ most of whom were still in their homes when the NATO
bombardment began _ so U.S. and British spokesmen at the Turkish
base at Incirclik, from which many of the fighter-bombers are
taking off, say that they are trying to protect the Iraqi Shiites
and Kurds from Saddam Hussein's wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Yet statements from the Iraqi opposition make it clear that
dozens of Iraqi opponents of Saddam Hussein are being tortured and
summarily executed in the areas which British and American jets are
daily overflying.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have meanwhile resorted to the usual economy with
the truth _ as have the Iraqis. According to Rear Admiral Craig
Quigley on Aug. 5, only 108 attacks had been made against Iraqi
targets this year.
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant General Shaheen Yassin, the commander of Iraqi
anti-aircraft defenses, said that U.S. and British planes had
carried out 10,977 sorties.
</P>
<P>
   The catch, of course, is that each raid recorded by Quigley
could constitute at least a dozen separate air strikes. And
``sorties'' include transport, refuelling and surveillance aircraft
on a single mission.
</P>
<P>
   Figures calculated for the past eight months suggest that
British and American aircraft have individually undertaken more
than 500 bombing missions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   It is also worth recalling that two prominent British defense
magazines _
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft Illustrated and Jets _ concluded that even the ``Desert
Fox'' bombardment of last December had no effect on Saddam
Hussein's hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft Illustrated said that 25 percent of the attacks missed
their targets and that ``all but one of the Weapons of Mass
Destruction (the supposed target of coalition jets) escaped severe
damage'' in an operation which ``achieved little more than
face-saving.''
</P>
<P>
   So what are we doing bombing Iraq? &QL;

   MEDINAH, Ill. _ Had they told him a few days ago that he would
be 6 under par through three rounds of this PGA Championship, Jay
Haas would have been very happy.
</P>
<P>
   So here he is, 6 under through 54 holes and Haas is anything but
happy. Quite the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed I didn't do better,'' said Haas. ``I had a
lot of chances, but my irons weren't very good. I just hit some bad
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first two days of this tournament, Haas quietly went
about his job, a tough task given the commotion that was going on
around him all week. But Haas is used to the background; he has
never screamed for the spotlight, never been flashy, and never hit
it a mile. All he has done is effectively put up a 22-year career
that includes nine wins and some serious runs at the Masters and
this championship.
</P>
<P>
   And with six birdies in an opening round of 68, and six more for
a 67 Friday, Haas was the surprise leader by one shot at 9 under
through 36 holes. A surprise to observers _ and to himself. ``I
haven't really been playing that well,'' he said. ``So it was nice
to get into this position.''
</P>
<P>
   At 45, Haas knows how to calm the nerves, so no worries as he
went off in the last group with lefthander Mike Weir. Surely, the
veteran would handle the moving day experience better than an
unproven youngster from Canada. Guess again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very cool. Hit a lot of nice shots and putted very
well,'' said Haas of his playing partner who would post a 69 to get
to 11 under, which will keep him in the final group Sunday _ this
time with Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Haas? He'll play a few groups in front, because his round of 75
dropped him to 6-under. It was a round without a birdie. It was
also a round that showed bad signs early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a great drive on the first hole and only had a 9-iron
left,'' said Haas, ``and I left it 40 feet short and right.'' He
settled for par on a hole he had birdied the first two days.
</P>
<P>
   Haas hit a bad shot on the par-3 second, and though he got it
up-and-down, it is hard to get deeper into red numbers when you are
scrambling for par. Particularly when those chasing you are making
birdies, like Weir did at the second to pull into a tie.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the last time all day Haas would have a piece of the
top spot. He made another bad approach to the par-4 third, made
bogey, and was one behind. At the sixth, he drove it perfectly and
thought he'd have a good chance to knock it close. ``But it landed
in a divot and I was lucky to gouge a 9-iron out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   When he made the turn in 39, Haas had fallen to 6 under. Tiger
Woods, playing ahead of Haas, was 10 under, Wier was at 9, Stewart
Cink and Jim Furyk were both at 7.
</P>
<P>
   Though he came home with nine straight pars, that isn't going to
gain you anything _ unless you're at a US Open or perhaps crazy
enough to return to Carnoustie. No, an even-par 36 knocked Haas
even further off the lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was 6:15 and Haas virtually had the whole right side of the
practice area to himself, with only Sweden's Gabriel Hjerstedt in
close view. Haas took some swings, then put on his coach's hat. His
son by the same name took his turn and began drilling shots into
the picture-perfect blue skies. Jay Haas Jr. is caddieing for his
father and in a few days he'll be heading to Augusta State College.
</P>
<P>
   As Team Haas hit balls, at the far end of the range, Woods was
about to end his practice session. So at the urging of fans, Woods
started his now-famous routine _ bouncing a ball off the face of
his wedge, keeping it going as he moved the club between his legs,
then back around. The fans loved it, but when Woods tried to finish
by whacking the ball down the range, he fanned.
</P>
<P>
   Loud groans, so Woods did it again. This time he succeeded, and
the fans roared.
</P>
<P>
   Woods moved rapidly from the range, as if he right then and
there wanted to tee it up in search of what very well could be his
second major title in his 12th chance as a pro.
</P>
<P>
   Haas barely noticed. He had a few more swings to make. He was
now five shots off the lead in his 67th start in a major
championship. Most likely it will end the same as the previous 66 _
without a win _ but it will be played the same way, too. With a
determined effort.

OH, CANADA! THERE'S A SURPRISE ATOP LEADERBOARD 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ We'll give them Larry Walker, but what is this
nonsense about a Canadian tying Tiger Woods for the third-round
lead in the PGA Championship?
</P>
<P>
   Golf, Canada. Canada, Golf. Does this have any kind of a ring?
</P>
<P>
   Sure it does. Kind of like, Baseball, Afghanistan. Afghanistan,
Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving Larry Walker out of this, what does a good Canadian lad
do? He skates. He skates, he shoots, and, hopefully, he scores! Or
maybe he makes a skate save. He can play golf in his spare time. We
all know every NHL player worth his dentures loves golf. That
doesn't mean he's very good at it.
</P>
<P>
   This one is.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Mike Weir identifies himself as a hockey player. ``I
played some left wing as a kid,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Weir. Mike Who? Even the Canadians don't know from Mike
Weir, but he has shot 68-68-69_205 in the first three rounds of the
PGA and that's the same score as Tiger Woods. It's also two shots
better than Sergio Garcia's 207 (also Stewart Cink, who can
certainly play but needs to see a judge about a new name).
</P>
<P>
   The differences between the co-leaders far transcend the obvious
ones, like skin tone, place of birth, and bank accounts. Mike Weir
is lefthanded; how about that? Mike Weir was never on television
swinging a golf club at age 2. Mike Weir did not enter the PGA Tour
as an anointed prince, complete with endorsement deals. Mike Weir
came into the luxurious PGA the hard way, via Australia and the
dreaded Qualifying School.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger was raised to be a champion. Mike Weir was just another
sports-hungry kid in Sarnia, Ontario. He did not grow up
worshipping George Knudson or Al Balding, the only two Canadian
golfers anyone can name. He is from the same home town as Dino
Ciccarelli, Tony McKegney, Pat Verbeek, and all those damnable
Hunter Brothers (Dale, mostly). Lotta high sticks, there.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 10 or so the family moved across the street from the
Huron Oaks Country Club, and that's where young Michael was
introduced to golf. He wrote Jack Nicklaus a letter when he was 13
asking the great man if he should convert to playing righthanded.
Amazingly, Nicklaus wrote back, telling him to stay right where he
was, so to speak. So that was cleared up. Mike Weir could think
about becoming the next Bob Charles (this was pre-Phil Mickelson).
But so what? This was Canada, remember? The golf season is what,
two hours long?
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's a throwaway line. ``The season starts in late March.
It's still damp until then,'' reports Weir.
</P>
<P>
   He got good enough to earn a golf scholarship to BYU, although
it's not like he was Mr. Big, or anything. He turned pro in 1992
and got onto the Canadian Tour in 1993, but, no offense, no one
makes any money on the Canadian Tour. The goal is to get on the PGA
Tour.
</P>
<P>
   His travels took him to Australia, and that wasn't what you call
a euphoric experience, either. ``I was in Australia, missing cut
after cut, with no money,'' he recalls. ``I remember battling out
there on the range, until it was so dark you couldn't see 5 feet in
front of you. I always keep those thoughts in the memory bank.''
</P>
<P>
   And, oh, that Draconian Q-School. He failed to get out of it the
first four tries. The fifth time, he started out with what he
called a ``good 75,'' after which he settled down and shot 27 under
par in the next five rounds to win medal honors. Hallelujah! Free
at last! And PGA-certified, too.
</P>
<P>
   Golfers often undergo dramatic technical transformations, and
Mike Weir is no exception. You think you know what you're doing
even when you really don't. Weir's epiphany came when he found
himself on a practice range one day in 1995 next to Nick Price,
then master of all he surveyed in the golfing world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball was coming off his club like little bullets, and I
thought, `There is no way I can do that with my swing,' '' says
Weir. ``I had to reconstruct everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to 1999. He missed the cut three of the first five
times out, but then got into a little groove. He was fifth at the
BellSouth Classic and played really well at the Motorola Western,
where he found himself paired with Himself in the final round.
Tiger already had a four-shot lead, so winning wasn't much of an
option. But Weir shot a respectable 70 and walked off with a
second-place finish and $270,000 paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   You probably missed that. Most Americans and Canadians did. The
first time most people heard of Mike Weir was Thursday, when he
shot that opening-round 68. Well, OK, a lot of unknowns and
quasi-knowns score well on Thursday. Most of them are home by
Saturday. Not Mike Weir. He has been abusing Medinah, and now a
whole lot of people will be tuning in Sunday to see Tiger battle
Sergio and asking themselves, ``Where did this little (5 feet 9
inches) lefty come from, and why is he saying `aboot?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm the underdog,'' he says. ``Tiger's the best player
in the world, and I'm a guy who once had no tour card.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and let's not forget Sergio, who, truth be told, definitely
forgot about him when he had the microphone. ``He's 19,'' says
Weir. ``Amazing. When I was 19, I couldn't even beat my buddies on
the BYU team, let alone the best players in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Suppose Weir wins. Will those madcap Canadians riot in the
streets? ``That's a good question,'' he says. ``They may get
excited. Or no one might care at all. I just hope I get to find
out, one way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   A lefthanded Canadian refugee from the Q-School might win a
major. I've told you before and I'll tell you again. I'll take
truth, plus the points, over fiction any time.

MAGGERT'S ON CUP CUSP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ It is a most painful walk that golfers make,
those steps from the 18th green to the scorer's trailer after 18
holes that did not go particularly well.
</P>
<P>
   With reporters waiting, it becomes a bare-footed walk on
white-hot coals.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, each of them stopped, void of excuses. Graciousness is
still present and accounted for out here.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Maggert was perhaps the most disappointed, though there is
still reason to believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd give my eye teeth to play,'' he said late Friday of his
desire for a Ryder Cup berth, ``but it is out of my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't when he arrived at Medinah, however, for he was 10th
in the Ryder Cup standings and could have secured his spot with a
good performance. Maggert failed. He shot 73-76 and missed the cut
at 5 over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm mentally worn out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he remains 10th in the standings, several of those behind
him _ most notably Tom Lehman at No. 11 _ could push him out of
automatic-pick territory. No, he said with a smile, he wouldn't be
doing any voodoo as he watches the weekend action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish Tom Lehman all the best. I'd like to see him play
well.''
</P>
<P>
   There was irony to the proceedings, said Maggert, recalling that
in both 1995 and 1997 he played his way onto the team with red-hot
PGA Championship finishes at Riviera and Winged Foot, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's my turn to get bounced out,'' he said. ``I can't
control that, though. I'm not going to go home and root against
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he embraces optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I finish 11th, I think I'm a strong contender (for a
captain's pick),'' he said. ``Certainly, I think my game fits The
Country Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Stricker and John Huston did not hold out such hope. They
entered this PGA Championship 12th and 13th in the standings and
knew it was simple: Play your way on. Both came up woefully short,
a fact so disheartening they talked of a season that is virtually
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ryder Cup was very important, no doubt I wanted to be on
that team,'' said Stricker, who shot 72-76 to miss the cut. It
included a back-nine 40 in the second round that had him shaking
his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I double-bogeyed 15, bogeyed 16, and bogeyed 17, it was
hard to play 18. I don't expect to be picked. I wouldn't want to be
a part of the team the way I've been hitting it the last couple of
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Stricker said he would go home and spend time putting the
disappointment behind him. No plans for any more tournaments, at
least not yet, said Stricker, and certainly no way he'll wait for
an invitation to the Sept. 24-26 matches in Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Huston is another who doesn't expect any phone calls from US
captain Ben Crenshaw. His PGA Championship came to an end with a
second-day 80, an ugly effort lowlighted by a triple-bogey 6 at the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just playing horribly,'' said Huston. ``Mentally, I need some
time off. I'll play in Akron (the NEC Invitational, a World Golf
Championship event), then maybe not again this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The push for a Ryder Cup spot, said Huston, had worn him down at
a time when his game was struggling.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Janzen was another who had Ryder Cup hopes when he arrived
at Medinah, though admittedly his chance was more of a long shot.
He may be a two-time US Open champion and two-time Ryder Cup
member, but Janzen was 23d in the standings and probably needed to
win this event.
</P>
<P>
   He never came close, shooting 73-75 to miss the cut.
</P>
<P>
   Was he, too, disappointed? Just as he had been in 1995 when
captain Lanny Wadkins bypassed him with one of his two captain's
picks?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to catch a plane,'' said Janzen, waving off
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   We'll take that as yes, he's disappointed.

<P>
   MASHANTUCKET PEQUOT RESERVATION _ There was a rare occurence in
a boxing ring Saturday &UR;  &LR; night at the Grand Pequot Ballroom at
Foxwoods Casino: Two guys who really knew how to fight were
actually fighting each other.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 rounds, World Boxing Council lightweight champion Stevie
Johnston and challenger Angel Manfredy put on a clinic on the manly
art of self-defense. This was no wild-eyed brawl, no lopsided
mismatch, no battle of clinches. This was boxing the way it used to
be, two technically proficient fighters working at close quarters
most of the night, slipping, feinting, landing some hard punches
and avoiding a lot more of them.
</P>
<P>
   It was a night when no one had to look to find the other because
it would have been difficult to slip a fax between them as they
fired away, each pressing the other and refusing to have their
wills broken even after one (Manfredy) had broken his right hand
and the other (Johnston) injured his left and bled from a cut that
needed many stitches to close.
</P>
<P>
   That neither carried the megatonnage to take out the other was
of little importance. This was boxing the way it's supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Johnston retained his title by unanimous decision as
judges Terry Smith and Tom Kaczmarek saw him a 116-112 winner,
while Bob Logist scored it 118-111 for the champion. The Globe card
also had Johnston winning, 116-112.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth round was typical as the two battled at close
quarters with Johnston strafing Manfredy from off the ropes with
some crushing right hands and Manfredy answering whenever his chin
wasn't being bombed. At the end of the round, you thought Johnston
had the edge but it wouldn't take the Lincoln-Douglas debates to
argue the other way.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's only upset came earlier when Arturo Gatti didn't
have to go to a plasma center after his comeback win over
overmatched Reyes Munoz.
</P>
<P>
   The oft-lanced former junior lightweight champion made a quick
comeback after three straight losses when he stopped the factory
worker from Erie, Pa., at the end of the first round, dropping him
with a right behind the head and a short following left.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz got up staggering as referee Eddie Cotton approached but
before he could touch Munoz the fighter stumbled away, slumping
into the ropes and then turning from Cotton and bending over like a
man feeling sick to his stomach.
</P>
<P>
   When he continued to reel around blindly, Cotton stopped the
fight after finally lassoing him as the bell sounded to end the
opening round. Several minutes later, Munoz was flat on his back on
a stretcher and taken from the ring wearing a neck brace and an
oxygen mask as his mother and wife both stood crying and in shock
at ringside.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dr. Anthony Alessi said it was a precautionary measure
and later said Munoz was stable, it was a hard end to a hard road
Munoz had been walking throughout his boxing career. Munoz came
into this bout having trained two hours a day while not missing a
single one of his $12-an-hour shifts at an Erie factory that makes
concrete barriers, a disadvantage nearly as serious as the clear
talent difference between himself and the hard-punching Gatti.
</P>
<P>
   Despite 25 prize fights, Munoz had never had the opportunity to
be a professional fighter in the true sense and he quickly paid for
it Saturday &UR;  &LR; night. Although he fights for money, Munoz (21-4)
never made enough for a living, as Gatti (30-4, 25 KOs) had done
all his career.
</P>
<P>
   The $20,000 he earned Saturday &UR;  &LR; night didn't come easily either
during the fight or before it. It meant so much to his family that
his wife thanked HBO executive Lou DiBella for having given her
husband the opportunity. Just getting here on time cost Munoz three
vacation days.
</P>
<P>
   The vacation clearly stopped not long after he entered the ring.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-champion, who was coming off an eight-month layoff and
three straight losses that had thrown his boxing future into doubt,
watched silently as Munoz was loaded on the stretcher and sent to
Backus Hospital in Norwich. When he was gone, a man who had often
left boxing rings bloody and battered could only say, ``I didn't
really know what this kid had. It was my comeback fight after three
losses but Munoz's condition puts a damper on everything. I'm very
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   So was a family to whom $20,000 seemed like a lot less money
when Reyes Munoz was leaving the arena than when he came into it.

A FEW SURPRISES FOR SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The loudest sound in the Seattle clubhouse came from a
single air conditioning vent. Only the persistent rattle saved the
room from absolute silence. But despite the best efforts of the
noisy machinery, a mustiness enveloped the area where players
quickly dressed and tersely commented on Saturday's events.
</P>
<P>
   When just a handful of players and coaches remained, a video of
the Mariners' 13-2 loss to the Red Sox was replayed on a television
in the corner. The visitors cued the tape to the top of the fifth
inning. Lefthanded pitcher Rheal Cormier readied himself on the
mound for one final out. Then, the camera cut to a grinning Pedro
Martinez in the bullpen. The Red Sox ace turned temporary reliever
chewed his gum and blew pink bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the action on the field, Cormier delivered his
final pitch and Seattle catcher Tom Lampkin singled to right. Butch
Huskey fielded the ball and threw home, attempting to prevent David
Bell from scoring. The plate umpire called the Mariner out. Manager
Lou Piniella and third base coach Steve Smith earned ejections for
arguing the play. From all angles on the tape, Bell appeared safe.
</P>
<P>
   In 30 seconds of muted video, Seattle's disappointing afternoon
played out a second time. Between the controversial call at the
plate that robbed the visitors of a second run in the fifth and the
smiling bullpen visage of a tardy Martinez, the Mariners had a
catalog of bizarre distractions to choose from. But none of the
game's oddities could take the focus of a second loss at Fenway
that dropped Seattle farther out of the playoff picture in the
West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little surprised,'' said Alex Rodriquez about seeing
Martinez in a relief role, ``but he wants to get his work in. It
doesn't mean anything. The game was out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox held a 7-1 lead when the ace relieved Cormier. And
Rodriguez's home run in the sixth and double in the eighth did
little to improve matters.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle pitcher Jeff Fassero, who played with Martinez in
Montreal, chatted with the scheduled starter over the bullpen wall.
The two former teammates touched briefly on Martinez's late
arrival. The Boston pitcher did not elaborate on his tardiness,
adding only that because he was late manager Jimy Williams decided
not to start him. Instead, Martinez and Fassero talked about old
times with the Expos.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's their business, not ours,'' said Fassero, when asked
about Martinez's lack of punctuality.
</P>
<P>
   The only player on the Seattle side investing any significance
in a relief appearance by the Dominican was Edgar Martinez. The
Mariners' designated hitter collected his 1,500th career hit with a
single in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro is one of the best pitchers in baseball,'' said Edgar
Martinez. ``It means more when you can get it off of somebody like
him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the corner of the clubhouse opposite the video machinery,
Bell sat and calmly tried to explain the controversial play.
Piniella was not available for comment. The second baseman said he
didn't feel a tag, but could not tell how much the swipe by Boston
catcher Jason Varitek missed his left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game can be kind of unpredictable at times,'' said Bell.
``But the bottom line is that we lost and that's all we're thinking
about right now. (Pedro and the controvesial call) are the kind of
things that you have to kind of deal with and be ready to handle.''

<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ It was the week pro golf turned into major
league baseball. Or was it the NBA? No matter. It became everything
you detest about professional sports. Instead of Dave Pelz
infomercials, The Golf Channel probably went in search of Judge
Wapner or Jerry Springer.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen holes worth of thoughts, observations, and wonderment:
</P>
<P>
   1) Phil Mickelson demanded to know, ``Who negotiated that
deal?'' when advised that The Country Club was being paid millions
to host the Ryder Cup. To which he should have been told: ``None of
your business. Now put down the briefcase, take off the Rolex, and
pick up your clubs. Go find the range and work on that swing so it
holds up when the pressure is on.''
</P>
<P>
   2) David Duval told us that he never used the word ``boycott.''
What he said was: ``It would take players not playing'' to change
things. Funny, sounds like the definition of boycott.
</P>
<P>
   3) Duval said he perhaps should not have called the Ryder Cup
``an exhibition,'' a term that enraged captain Ben Crenshaw. ``How
can David say that,'' said Crenshaw, ``when he hasn't even played
in one?'' But Duval only recanted halfway. ``But it seems like a
large corporate outing, doesn't it?'' he said. Sure it does. Just
like every other sporting event that goes on in this country.
Wonder if Duval had a problem with that corporate outing at TPC
Sawgrass in March? Or was the $900,000 check enough of a pacifier?
</P>
<P>
   4) We were told time and again ``everyone was on the same
page.'' To his credit, Duval told us he did not want to receive any
compensation in any form. Next in the press room, Tiger Woods said,
``I would like to see us receive whatever the amount is, whether it
is $200,000, $300,000, $400,000, $500,000 . . . whatever it is. And
I think we should be able to keep the money and do whatever we see
fit. For me, personally, I would donate all of it to charity. But I
think it's up to the other person's discretion of what they want to
do with it.'' Maybe they are on the same page. But it sounds like
they are reading different books.
</P>
<P>
   5) Nick Faldo, probably the most confused golfer on the planet,
stood on the putting green in front of Medinah Country Club's
massive clubhouse, wearing a sly grin as two dozen reporters chased
after players who had just left a closed-door meeting. ``And they
wonder why they can't win this team event,'' is what the look on
his face said.
</P>
<P>
   6) Duval was asked if this was all about having money given to
him so that he could dish it to charity and receive a big tax
break. Stunned, Duval shook his head. ``Man, I'm just a golfer,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   7) Let me understand: The PGA of America (a nonprofit
organization) opens its books, shows where it funnels money from
the Ryder Cup, and the players say there is no problem with where
it goes. It's just that a few private-jet golfers would like
control, a voice, some accountability.
</P>
<P>
   8) Which makes me wonder: When Larry Rinker, Danny Edwards, and
a few of the second- and third-tier players wanted the PGA Tour (a
for-huge-profit organization) to open its books and explain a few
financial matters, all they were talking about was having control,
a voice, some accountability. The private-jet golfers screamed,
``No way. All is well.''
</P>
<P>
   9) Mark O'Meara claimed Crenshaw had not singled him out. Yes he
did, O'Meara was told. No he didn't, said O'Meara. Yes he did,
O'Meara was told. Finally, O'Meara realized that Crenshaw had, in
fact, named him. He walked away muttering, ``I still can't believe
he singled me out.'' Mark, have you been living on the moon
recently?
</P>
<P>
   10) Mark James: ``We're not going into the Ryder Cup for money.
Never have been. Even in Europe the guys who are making the team
are making 350,000-400,000 pounds prize money. And you want a bit
more for playing in the Ryder Cup? When half the Tour would
actually pay to play in it? We're losing touch with reality, some
people, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   11) Crenshaw: ``I'm personally disappointed in a couple of
people in that meeting. I mean that. And they know who they are.
And whether some players like it or not, there are some people who
came before them that mean a hell of a lot to this game. And it
burns the hell out of me to listen to some of their viewpoints.'' A
round of applause, please.
</P>
<P>
   12) What did Jay Haas think of Crenshaw's statements? ``It's
about time,'' said Haas.
</P>
<P>
   13) Sitting in the audience listening to Crenshaw speak was club
pro Bruce Zabriski. He got so fired up that he told some reporters
he was ready to run through walls for the captain. If you ever saw
Zabriski, you would have no doubt that he could run through a wall.
</P>
<P>
   14) Remember Woods vs. Duval Aug. 2? Made-for-TV excitement? How
about another one, say Woods-O'Meara vs. Duval-Mickelson? Let's say
they schedule it for Sept. 25, a Saturday night. It conflicts with
the Ryder Cup, so it is perfect. They get an exhibition that
shouldn't be taken seriously, and they get the all-important
dollar. Crenshaw gets to pick Tom Lehman, Fred Couples, Corey
Pavin, Paul Azinger, Hale Irwin, and Zabriski to round out his
12-man team. The US wins, 17-11. Woods-O'Meara vs. Duval-Mickelson
pulls in a 6.2 rating. Everybody is happy.
</P>
<P>
   15) The PGA of America is not totally without blame. It knew
about this mess. Tom Kite has been quoted as saying he warned the
organization after the 1997 debacle in Valderrama that the issue
had to be addressed. The PGA of America let it go too far.
</P>
<P>
   16) Davis Love. His passion for the game is genuine. He
rightfully felt the issue should have been settled behind closed
doors. It wasn't, not because of the media, but because
self-centered players like Woods and Duval sadly have aligned
themselves with the ultimate boor, O'Meara, instead of a class act
such as Love.
</P>
<P>
   17) In all of this mess, hardly any mention was made of the club
pros. They are the heart and soul of the organization and I would
be willing to bet that nearly every PGA Tour pro owes something to
a club pro somewhere down the line. With all the talk of spreading
out the proceeds, not enough people have said that the club pros
deserve a bigger piece of the pie. They do.
</P>
<P>
   18) Somehow, we managed to have all this chaos without John Daly
in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The two best stories of 1999 in golf? Give me Jerry Higginbottom
and Colin Cann. They were the well-respected caddies for O'Meara
and Annika Sorenstam, respectively, until those relationships came
to an end. Surely, their many friends felt for them, since toting
bags for such high-profile and successful golfers is rewarding and
from all accounts, neither Higginbottom nor Cann was guilty of
anything other than being in a high-risk trade. But before anyone
could feel too sorry for them, Higginbottom and Cann landed quite
nicely _ the former with Sergio Garcia, the latter with Grace Park.
Garcia, you know about. Park, you soon will, for it says here she
will be the dominating LPGA Tour player starting in 2000. Park,
last summer's US Women's Amateur champion, turned pro after the US
Women's Open in early June, and is proof positive that sometimes
father does know best. Her father, an extremely wealthy and
influential businessman in Korea, insisted on a long-term
investment, not a short-term fling of sponsor's exemptions to LPGA
Tour events. Thus, Park has toiled far from the spotlight, playing
the hard-to-find Futures Tour. With four wins in eight starts, she
is the leading money-winner, a status that would be rewarded with
her Tour card for next year. No qualifying school for this young
lady, whose power, finesse, and composure will take the sport by
storm next year . . . So how did a kid from Madison, Wis., end up
at the University of Hartford? It was the only college where he
would be able to play golf and hockey, said Jerry Kelly. Then, he
said, ``They dropped hockey when I got there. I was awfully
disappointed, but in retrospect it was the best thing that ever
happened to me.'' Kelly is in his fourth year on the PGA Tour and
made the cut in the PGA Championship after getting in as first
alternate. Last year, Kelly withdrew from the championship to be
with his wife on the birth of their son, Cooper. Two of Kelly's
best friends are NHLers from his hometown _ Kevin Dean, now with
the Atlanta Thrashers, and Barry Richter . . . Ironic twist to this
pay-for-play nonsense: The PGA of America announced that it has
gotten involved with an important renovation project at Clearview
Golf Club in East Canton, Ohio. It is the first and only golf
course in the US designed, built, and managed by an
African-American, William J. Powell. His daughter, Renee, a former
LPGA Tour player, is the head pro and son Lawrence is the course
superintendent. Architects Michael Hurdzan and Pete Dye have been
enlisted by the PGA of America to help with renovations, which
should be completed by next spring.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a short but very sweet PGA Championship experience for
Mike Baker, the club pro out of Bangor, Maine. ``For the first
eight holes I felt like I belonged out here,'' said Baker, who went
to the second stage of Tour qualifying last year and may give it
another shot this fall, ``but then I played the last 10 like a
dunce.'' He shot 36-44 for an opening 80, and followed it up with a
75 to post an 11-over total. ``I gave the folks back home something
to get excited about early,'' said Baker. Still, the trip was
everything Baker had thought it would be. ``Actually more so,'' he
said. ``It was kind of neat signing autographs, even though nobody
knew who I was. I wasn't that nervous on my first drive. I was more
nervous when I got it under par.'' Baker's caddie was Tom Caron,
who works for the Bangor Daily News. If possible, he had a more
enjoyable trip than Baker, though this was a ``one-time job.''
Caron filed daily accounts for his newspaper and said lugging a
pro's golf bag is a heavier burden than he had imagined. ``But he
would have to have paid to have the club provide a caddie,'' said
Caron, laughing. ``I was doing it for free. I saved him big
bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What has been a tough stretch of golf took a good turn at a most
opportune time for James Driscoll of Chestnut Hill. The
senior-to-be at the University of Virginia won the prestigious
North-South Amateur at Pinehurst No. 2 Friday, thrashing John Pitt,
9 and 7, in the 36-hole final.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad way to head to Pebble Beach, where Driscoll will begin
play in the US Amateur Sunday. The two-time Massachusetts Amateur
champion was coming off a disappointing collegiate career, as well
as an earlier-than-expected exit from the State Am at Kittansett.
</P>
<P>
   At Pinehurst Friday, Driscoll made just three birdies, but the
key to his victory was a bushel of pars. In fact, he told Golfweek,
``I was lucky that I caught a lot of good players on their off
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Pitt, Driscoll stormed to a 5-up lead through 10 holes,
and did not relinquish honors at the tee until the 16th. Pitt won
holes 15-17 to reduce Driscoll's lead to 3 up, much to delight of
the hometown fans (Pitt hails from Wilmington, N.C.).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little worried at the end of the morning round,'' said
Driscoll. ``He had the momentum from his gallery and I told myself
to forget the morning round, to treat the afternoon as a separate
match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to win the afternoon match.''
</P>
<P>
   He followed his game plan to the letter, jumping out quickly to
get back up by five holes and cruising to the impressive win.

HARD FEELINGS FOR WILLIAMS TO MOP UP 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ These should be glory days at Fenway Park. The Sox are
rolling, Brian Daubach (5 for 5 Saturday, 11 RBIs in two days) is
suddenly a direct descendant of Walt Dropo and Fred Lynn, every
game is a sellout, and Boston again leads the wild-card bakeoff.
</P>
<P>
   So why was there old-timey turmoil at Fenway Saturday? Why did
$75 million ace Pedro Martinez rip into manager Jimy Williams after
getting credit for his 17th win with four innings of mop-up duty?
</P>
<P>
   Because Williams spanked Martinez for being too late to prepare
for his start. Williams opted for the immortal Bryce Florie, then
summoned Pedro for garbage-time punishment with the Sox leading,
7-1, in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who said he was late because he was at home working
with a personal therapist, was furious with his manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on time to start,'' said the ace. ``I excused myself
with my teammates, but Jimy didn't let me do it . . . Jimy wanted
to be stubborn. I told him that there's no reason to do that. It
could have stayed in the clubhouse, but instead he had to make a
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated, Martinez added, ``He didn't have any reason to
embarrass me out there. If I'm a bad influence on the team, they'd
better get me out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams's door was closed after Pedro delivered his postgame
blast. But before the ace was interviewed, the manager said, ``He
was late. We had to make a decision and start another pitcher. He
wasn't here yet. I didn't know where he was. He got here after the
decision was made to start another pitcher. You don't just come in
and throw your clothes on and run out to the bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   The club rule is that starting pitchers must be at the park one
hour before game time. According to Williams, Martinez was still
absent about a half-hour before the game. Martinez admitted being
late, but insisted he was prepared to start. After engaging in a
heated exchange with Williams, he went out to the bullpen. By that
time Florie, who had yet to start throwing, was stretching in the
outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess Jimy doesn't trust my way of being out there every
five days,'' said Martinez. ``He knows I told him the truth. I
guess you're better off lying. If I had told him a family member
passed away, it probably would have been OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager would not make any comment on disciplinary action,
saying, ``We keep everything in-house.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what Martinez claimed the manager did not do.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, we're still wondering why in the name of Denny
Galehouse Williams would bring Martinez out of the bullpen to start
the sixth inning of a game the Sox were leading, 7-1 _ a game
Boston went on to win, 13-2? Williams would appear to have
forfeited one of Pedro's starts in the name of principle.
</P>
<P>
   How is this good for the team? It was a maneuver of Daddy Butch
Hobson dimensions. With Saturday's game in hand and Pedro still on
ice, would it not have made sense to pitch the ace Sunday, then
bring him back on Friday? Mark Portugal gets bumped. Big deal.
</P>
<P>
   When this question was put to Joe Kerrigan, the pitching coach
said nothing except, ``You're asking the wrong guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We brought him in because we needed another reliever,'' said
Williams. ``I'm trying to win a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Punishment?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, just trying to help the team win a game,'' said the
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Why not pitch Pedro Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   ``A moot point. You can answer that yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Why bring him into a game that's over?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you look at baseball different than I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Guess so. Virtual Rheal Cormier (who relieved Florie and pitched
to one batter) could have stayed in the game. Rich Garces and Mark
Guthrie were available. And if the Sox can't trust their
(admittedly depleted) bullpen with a 7-1 lead in the sixth, what
chance do they have in the race anyway?
</P>
<P>
   The bizarro day got off to a funny start for members of Red Sox
Nation who came to see Pedro and got Florie. It was the baseball
equivalent of buying your ticket to see Dustin Hoffman in ``Death
of a Salesman,'' then watching the curtain go up and looking at
Matt LeBlanc as Willy Loman.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox fans lined up for standing room early Saturday. They
poured into Fenway toting K-cards and Dominican flags. Nobody
thought to bring the state flag of South Carolina, the home of
Florie.
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to be one of those World Cup-Comes-To-Fenway
Saturday afternoon specials. But Pedro was late for work and the
Sox opted for the immortal Florie as a stand-in starter.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro is hardly the first Sox starter to have trouble getting to
the park on time. When Oil Can Boyd worked here, Sox management was
in constant crisis, waiting around the clubhouse wondering if the
Can would show _ much like Boston Garden rock fans of the 1970s,
hoping the Rolling Stones would get out of a Rhode Island jail in
time to start a concert before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Florie's 4 2/3-inning stint was impressive, but a far cry from
the best in Sox history. Most of you no doubt remember Ernie
Shore's effort against the Washington Senators in 1917. In the
first game of a doubleheader, Babe Ruth walked leadoff hitter Ray
Morgan, then got tossed after beefing with umpire Brick Owen.
Without any warmup, Shore came on and retired 26 consecutive
batters after Morgan was caught stealing.
</P>
<P>
   Cormier came in to get the last out in the fifth Saturday, and
could have been awarded the easy victory, but official scorer
Charles Scoggins opted to give the win to the $75 million mop-up
man.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez surrendered a solo homer to Alex Rodriguez, but not
much more. The first K-Card went up when he picked up his 200th
strikeout (Jay Buhner) of the season. He finished with six
punchouts in four three-hit innings as the game lurched toward its
inevitable conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Then he blasted his manager.

PA'S BELLA FASTER THAN `EDDIE' 
</HEADLINE>
 DERBY-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   REVERE, Mass. _ The 65th running of the Wonderland Derby was
billed as a one-dog race, but, in truth, there were two top
greyhounds in the event, and 5-1 ($12.80 to win) second choice Pa's
Bella beat 2-5 favorite NR's Fast Eddie out of the box Saturday
night and was never headed as she romped to a 6-length victory.
</P>
<P>
   Based at Raynham Park, Pa's Bella was the second point-getter in
qualifying for the Derby, winning three straight before running
fourth in her final prelim. But NR's Fast Eddie had won all four
and run a blazing fast 37.92, second fastest in history for the
2,045 feet of the Revere Course. As a result, NR's Fast Eddie got
all the publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Pa's Bella, a 29-month-old daughter of P's Rasing Cain-Pacific
Episode, broke from No. 8 and simply was quicker to the turn than
NR's Fast Eddie, who started from No. 1. NR's Fast Eddie chased
bravely but to no avail, and Pa's Bella earned the $60,000 winner's
share for owner George Benjamin, who owns Benjamin's restaurant in
Taunton. The final time was 38.15, the third fastest in stakes
history, over a track turned wet by heavy rains that began about an
hour before post time of the Derby. TM's Show Buzz was along in
time to be third at 10-1 from box No. 2, another 4 1/2 lengths
behind, while Melleray was fourth, 2 more lengths in arrears, at
14-1 from box No. 3. The 8-1-2-3 superfecta returned $670.20.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she sprinted at Raynham, she had a great run,'' said
Benjamin, who has 80 dogs in his kennel at Raynham. ``The 8 hole is
her best hole in sprints. Once she gets running room, she's tough
to beat. She has some punch at the end. We tried her three times
going long at Raynham. The first time she took the lead and got
caught late, then she won the next two. She took to this track, as
you could see. I knew she had the right hole, it was just a matter
of the break.''
</P>
<P>
   Pa's Bella has a record of 37-20-6-4-5 at Raynham, and she
zipped through the first three qualifiers at Wonderland with clear
sailing. However, in the last prelim, she came up against NR's Fast
Eddie and could do no better than fourth, which accounted, in part,
for the disparity in the odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got trapped inside and never got a chance to run in that
final qualifier,'' said trainer Glenn Atkinson. ``NR's Fast Eddie
had never been contested. I wanted to see what would happen if he
was challenged for the lead. Whichever dog went to the front was
going to win because, even though it rained, the track stayed fast.
NR's Fast Eddie is a nice greyhound and I wouldn't want to have to
run against him 10 times in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Being from Taunton, Benjamin grew up around dog racing there,
when the Taunton track was open, and at Raynham, which eventually
added Taunton's dates. ``I always enjoyed dog racing,'' he said.
``I love the sport. I tied in with Glenn 15 years ago and we've had
our good times and our bad times. We had a dog, Dicky Valle, who
won the Greyhound Race of Champions. It's no longer run, but it had
a purse of $200,000, and we got $100,000 for that. This one is
sweet, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Pa's Bella has two full sisters, Pa's She Cat and Pa's Reale,
who are almost as good, although they don't have the strong finish
she has, and are more suited to a sprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pa's Bella is great in the kennel,'' said Atkinson. ``She's
happy-go-lucky. She's a great dog, with a great personality. Her
two sisters are very good, but she's the best of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Next for Pa's Bella will be the American Derby at Lincoln Sept.
11.

WOODS FINDS COMPANY IN WEIR 
</HEADLINE>
 CHAMPIONSHIP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ The 81st PGA Championship was turning into a
gala event, Tiger's Tournament, when Mike Weir insisted on crashing
the party.
</P>
<P>
   Golf's celestial majesty, Tiger Woods, was three strokes up on
the field at one point Saturday, poised to give the least
prestigious of the four major championships _ and the last of the
century _ elevated cachet by his mere presence atop the
leaderboard.
</P>
<P>
   He's there, all right, but he's not alone. Weir, the finest
29-year-old, 5-foot-9-inch, 155-pound lefthanded shotmaker in all
of Sarnia, Ontario, caught Woods with a stirring finish that
included an eagle on the 14th hole, a birdie on the 17th, and an
8-foot par save on the 18th. Woods wound up with a 68, Weir a 69,
and both stand at 11-under-par 205, two strokes ahead of teen dream
Sergio Garcia (68) and Stewart Cink (68) entering the final round.
</P>
<P>
   So here they go again. Last month at the Western Open in nearby
Lemont, Woods and Weir formed the final pairing, as they will
Sunday, and they finished the fourth round the way they started it
_ with Woods in front. It was his fourth victory of the year, yet
the prevailing sentiment as he steadily climbed to the summit here
seemed to be: What took so long?
</P>
<P>
   Only where Woods is concerned could a showing like this be
considered sinfully overdue.
</P>
<P>
   After his Masters masterpiece two years ago, he was expected to
ring up more major titles as incessantly as the cash register that
charts his astronomical endorsements. Instead, he has endured a
horrid slump, winning a mere eight tournaments around the world _
nine if you count his Showdown at Sherwood prime-time payday
against David Duval at the start of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive, you say? Not according to the standards of the
insatiable public that first took notice of this prodigy when he
displayed his skills for ``The Mike Douglas Show'' TV audience at
age 2, watched him devour the amateur ranks with assorted junior
trophies and three straight US titles, then formed a hallelujah
chorus when he established his domain over the pro game with his
Augusta assault at age 21.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, by their greedy reckoning, it's been one long yawn.
Woods's best finish in a major was third place in the 1998 British
Open, and while he said two days ago, ``You're not going to win
every time, and I've proven that,'' his disciples aren't buying it.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's on the threshold of obliging them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel more comfortable from the standpoint of the fact
that I've been there a few times now,'' said Woods, who has won
seven straight times when leading after three rounds. ``I've played
major championships at a high level where I've been in contention.
And it does make you feel more at ease, the fact that you've been
there. I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   That's for sure. His second breakthrough seemed a foregone
conclusion as he took an apparent stranglehold on this tournament
until late in the third round. Starting the day two strokes behind
leader Jay Haas _ who played like the 45-year-old he is and
disappeared with a 75_210 _ and one in back of Weir, Woods sliced
through the winds that plagued the 7,401-yard Medinah Country Club
course, notching birdies on the fifth, sixth, and seventh as he got
to 10 under. That earned him a tie for the lead with Weir, who
birdied 4 and 5. Woods built the margin to two strokes with a
birdie on the par-4 12th and retained it as both he and Weir
bogeyed 13.
</P>
<P>
   Woods seemed to seize control for good when he birdied the par-5
14th for a three-shot bulge. And then along came Weir.
</P>
<P>
   He is at the opposite end of the pecking order from Woods, a
netherworld figure who failed seven times in the PGA Tour
Qualifying School and hasn't won since finally gaining his card
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My realistic expectations were to get into contention in some
tournaments this year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday he could have been a southpaw Arnold Palmer with
the charge he unleashed after seemingly dropping out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   Playing a group behind, he one-upped Woods on the 14th when he
chipped from 25 yards through some trees and over a bunker for a 3
that turned the leader's advantage into a one-shot deal.
</P>
<P>
   While Woods parred in _ making a beautiful save on the 16th when
he escaped some trees with a swing on which he looked like a
carnival contortionist _ Weir wouldn't wilt.
</P>
<P>
   Just the opposite. He regained a piece of the lead when he hit a
4-iron to the right edge on the par-3 17th, then canned a 20-foot
putt. And he kept it after his second shot found the bunker on the
par-4 18th.
</P>
<P>
   He knows his place, but he isn't daunted by a return match with
the planet's most celebrated golfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind being the underdog,'' said Weir. ``I'm moving
along nicely, making strides in my game. I don't have anything to
lose tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, the 19-year-old first-round leader, and 1997 Greater
Hartford Open winner Cink are viable contenders. After that,
there's a substantial drop-off to the next grouping _ Haas,
two-time PGA champ Nick Price (69), Jim Furyk (69), and Skip
Kendall (71) _ all five shots back.
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, this is a two-man duel. And that's a stunner for
those who thought they were witnessing a one-man show.

MARTINEZ MISSES START BUT WINS IN RELIEF 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-MARINERS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ This time, to borrow his favorite expression, Pedro
Martinez wasn't in the house. At least not early enough to satisfy
manager Jimy Williams, who bounced the Red Sox ace from his
scheduled start Saturday when he was a late arrival to Fenway Park
and didn't phone in his regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was late . . . I didn't know where he was,'' Williams said
of his pitcher who failed to show up within the designated time
before his start. ``I had to make a decision, and tell another
pitcher to pitch. You need time to prepare. You don't just throw on
your clothes and go out there.''
</P>
<P>
   But timing, apparently, isn't everything, even on a day in which
Martinez said he was 10 to 15 minutes late because he stayed home
to be worked on by his personal therapist, but was prepared to take
his turn, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's anger at being scratched in favor of the previously
anonymous Bryce Florie was as apparent after the game as it was
during a heated dugout exchange beforehand with the Sox manager
(``If I'm a bad influence on this team, then maybe they should just
get rid of me''). But it had absolutely no bearing on the outcome,
a 13-2 beating of Seattle in which the Sox collected 19 hits, five
by rookie Brian Daubach, who also had six RBIs in a season that is
becoming more Joe Hardyish by the day, and the winning pitcher was
none other than Martinez, the reluctant reliever who was pouting in
the pen until summoned to turn out the lights, and went home with
his 17th win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't have mattered if another starter had been late,''
Williams said. ``I would have made the same decision. I had to get
another pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a grind. We've got to stay together. I think we are.
Now let's move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Florie, who was booed by the sellout crowd of 33,253 when he was
announced as the starting pitcher, gave up just a run on four hits
but was lifted one out before he pitched the five innings required
of a starting pitcher to be credited with a win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not disappointed,'' said Florie, the trading-deadline
acquisition from Detroit who had been used sparingly since joining
the Sox but was pressed into service because he was the freshest
arm available, according to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is all about wins,'' Florie said. ``With 46 games
left, we've got to get wins. I did my job. If I'd gotten another
win, that would have knocked me up to three. I don't think I'm
going to knock anybody out with three wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Florie, who hadn't started a game since June 6 with Detroit,
said he didn't find out until around 3:25, 40 minutes before the
scheduled start, that he'd be getting first call. ``They called me
into the office,'' he said, referring to Williams and pitching
coach Joe Kerrigan. ``I said, `All right.' I didn't ask any
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew. You're in the locker room. You can see who's here and
who's not here. Joe walked by and said, `Florie, in about five
minutes.' I looked around, Pedro wasn't here. Maybe they were going
to bump him, maybe he was tied up in traffic. I didn't know. They
called me, and told me I was starting.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as he scrambled to the outfield to stretch and play catch,
Florie wasn't sure that would remain the plan when he saw Martinez,
glove and jacket in hand, striding toward the bullpen 25 minutes
before the scheduled first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he looked, I thought he was starting,'' Florie said.
``He walked out, and I waited to see what would happen, but Joe
reassured me I was still pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   He pitched until David Bell's wall-scraping double scored Raul
Ibanez with two out in the fifth, and Williams summoned lefthander
Rheal Cormier. Cormier gave up a hit to the only batter he faced,
Tom Lampkin, but plate umpire Durwood Merrill decided that Bell was
out at the plate on Butch Huskey's throw from right field, even
though it appeared Bell eluded catcher Jason Varitek's tag.
</P>
<P>
   That led to a classic meltdown by Seattle manager Lou Piniella,
ejected for the third time this season: cap hurled to the turf,
dirt kicked at the plate, gestures bordering on burlesque as he
showed Merrill by how much he thought the umpire missed the call.
Third-base coach Steve Smith also was ejected by umpire Rocky Roe
as he spun away from Roe in an attempt to get to Merrill.
</P>
<P>
   Varitek's view of the play? ``Ask Durwood,'' he said with his
best poker face. ``The umpire called him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Martinez, who began the sixth with a 7-1 lead and vultured
a win, giving up three hits, including Alex Rodriguez's 30th home
run, while striking out six in four innings. Official scorer
Charles Scoggins, exercising his discretion, awarded the win to
Martinez, his first as a reliever since Sept. 6, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Punishment? No, that's not the way I look at it,'' said
Williams, who refused to say whether he had fined Martinez, though
you can be certain he went home with a lighter wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he apologized to his teammates before the game,
but still was adamant that he was prepared to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess Jimy doesn't trust my way to get out there every five
days,'' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   And to think the afternoon began as Sox Family Day, with the
wives and children of the players frolicking on the field before
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team's going to move forward,'' John Valentin said.
``Regardless of what happened. In any type of situation, we're
still a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Darren Lewis expressed a similar sentiment. ``He knows better,''
Lewis said. ``He knows as a professional that you have to show up
on time and be ready to play. He knows better than anybody. I'm
sure he feels bad about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not disappointed, because it didn't have anything to
do with me. Somebody else stepped in there and picked us up for
four or five innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Pedro. I have a tremendous amount of respect for him,
as a player and a person.''
</P>
<P>
   That adage about rules being made to be broken, especially if
you can get away with it, still applies, old hand Bret Saberhagen
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the bottom line,'' he said, ``is this team has a set of
rules in place and if you don't abide by them you're going to get
punished.''

and spiritual hunger of contemporary Westerners, too. It is ironic,

most startling to hear from a religious leader: That is, religion

 &HT;    Dalai Lama begins 11-day visit to Indiana
 &HT;    By Kathy Whyde Jesse
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Donna Denman was raised a Presbyterian, but four
times a week she sits cross-legged on the floor of the Dharma
Center in Yellow Springs, chanting and meditating and focused on a
statue of the Buddha.
</P>
<P>
   Denman, 65, retired director of the Greene County Housing
Authority, has practiced Zen Buddhism for the past 11 years. ``My
life goal has always been to serve others,'' she says, then laughs,
because she knows how Pollyanna-ish that sounds. ``I had a desire
to be unselfish, but no way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the major themes in Buddhism is our interdependence.
What we think affects how we act, which affects other people.
</P>
<P>
   ``In practicing Buddhism, the self begins to disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Transcendence from selfish concerns: By its very nature,
Buddhism seems incompatible with America's consumer society, fueled
by manufactured needs from tanning salons to sports utility
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But like the grains of sand in a mandala, particles of Buddhism
have sifted through to American popular culture: meditation and
yoga, the Beatles and Richard Gere.
</P>
<P>
   Five hundred years older than Christianity, conceived in India
and exported throughout most of Asia, Buddhism increasingly appeals
to the intellectual curiosity and spiritual hunger of contemporary
Westerners, too.
</P>
<P>
   It is ironic, then, that the Dalai Lama comes to Indiana this
week, not so much as an ambassador for Buddhism, but to deliver a
message that is most startling to hear from a religious leader:
That is, religion doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, Ethics for the New Millennium, the spiritual
and political leader of Tibet writes that ``... I have come to the
conclusion that whether or not a person is a religious believer or
not does not matter much. Far more important is that they be a good
human being.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama, speaks today at Market Square Arena in
Indianapolis on the subject of ``Transforming the Millennium.'' He
then travels to Bloomington, home of his older brother, a retired
Indiana University professor. At Bloomington's Tibetan Cultural
Center, the Dalai Lama will lead the eight-day ``Kalachakra
Initiation for World Peace,'' considered the most sacred of
Buddhist rituals.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony of teachings, prayers, meditations, dances and the
making and dismantling of a mandala _ a colored sand diagram used
as a meditational aid _ will be translated from Tibetan into
English and other languages. About 4,000 people are expected to
attend, paying $50 a day for a seat in the white, air-conditioned
tent.
</P>
<P>
   The public is invited, although there are posted prohibitions:
``While you are on the premises, observe the rules for lay
Buddhists living in pure conduct: i.e. no killing, stealing, lying,
sex, drugs or alcohol. Please respect the environment. Do not
litter.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his 11-day visit to Indiana, the Dalai Lama is
expected to hit hard on the theme of inter-religious harmony and
the need to forge a universally accepted code of ethical conduct _
work that has traditionally been done within the boundaries of the
world's religions, but doesn't necessarily have to begin there.
</P>
<P>
   How to do so? It's not an original idea, he writes in his book,
``but ordinary common sense ... we take as our starting point the
observation that we all desire happiness and not to suffer ... each
individual has a right to pursue happiness and avoid suffering ...
one of the things which determines whether an act is ethical or not
is its effect on anothers' ... experience or expectation of
happiness. An act that harms or does violence to this is
potentially an unethical act.''
</P>
<P>
   This 14th Dalai Lama, said to be reincarnated from his
predecessor in order to serve the people, has charmed much of the
world with his compassion, wit and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very dignified, quiet and humble,'' says Yuan Tsing, a
retired professor of Asian history at Wright State University, who
met the Dalai Lama in Bloomington about 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Of average build, wearing glasses and speaking English with a
heavy accent, the Dalai Lama repeatedly describes himself as a
``simple monk _ no more and no less.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1960, when the Communist Chinese invaded Tibet, the Dalai
Lama has carried out his duties from exile in India. His efforts to
seek autonomy for Tibet without the use of violence earned him the
1989 Nobel Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Among Buddhists, the Dalai Lama has as much respect as the pope
does among Catholics, Pryor says. But the Dalai Lama doesn't have
the organizational power. Buddhism isn't hierarchical; part of its
appeal to the estimated 2 to 5 million Americans who call
themselves Buddhists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very psychologically focused tradition, which fits well
with contemporary thought,'' says Robert Pryor, who teaches
``Buddhism in America'' at Antioch University. ``It resonates so
well with how Americans are feeling today, when you look at all the
phenomenal change in modern life. (Buddhism's) fundamental
challenge is accepting change and dealing with it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 60 paying members of the Dharma Center in Yellow
Springs, a nonprofit corporation created to provide information and
access to all forms of Buddhism: Zen, Tibetan, Vipassana and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Although Buddha was an historical figure, Buddhism doesn't
recognize a prime mover or creator, Pryor says. The focus is on
``the present, not how we got here. You just figure out how to live
your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans have found that they can appropriate bits and pieces
of Buddhism while still holding on to their other religious
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   That practicality is one of its attractions for Leisa Schaim, a
22-year-old Antioch student. Although she still feels connected to
her Jewish heritage, Judaism for her ``is centered so much on
prayers that somone else wrote. It is not personally connected to
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddhism seems to me a more concrete way of learning how to
live well and deal with life's circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many Americans, she came to Buddhism through the practice
of meditation, something she felt she needed to deal with the
stress in her life. Now, she says, she's leaning toward Buddhism
because ``I like the silence. That helps me more than parables.''
</P>
<P>
   She'll attend one day of the Kalachakra this week with a few
other Antioch students. Does she believe that a room full of people
chanting, praying and meditating can help bring about world peace?
She smiles. ``I don't know. I'm such a skeptic.'' She's taking her
time as she becomes comfortable with Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   And from skepticism, faith may flower.

 &HT;    Don't blame Big Bird for PBS list scandal
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stop picking on Big Bird! He's a toddler, for crying out loud,
as are all the Muppets on ``Sesame Street.'' They're too young to
vote, and they don't belong to political parties.
</P>
<P>
   The latest fracas surrounds the report last month that some PBS
stations have sold their donor lists to the Democratic Party. This
prompted an immediate attack from U.S. Rep. W.J. Tauzin, R-La.,
chairman of the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shakes the foundation of public broadcasting and
undermines the integrity of PBS,'' Tauzin said in a recent Los
Angeles Times article.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not really. As a matter of fact, it has nothing to do with
the integrity of PBS. It's a bogus controversy that will be used
against PBS when Congress reconvenes in the fall to mull the next
year's fundingbudget.
</P>
<P>
   First, a quick look at the facts. In mid-July, Tauzin's
subcommittee was told that several PBS stations, including WGBH in
Boston and WNET in New York, had passed their donor lists to the
Democratic National Committee. An investigation was called for that
found that about 25 to 30 of PBS's 349 stations (not Austin's KLRU)
had done the same thing, but two important mitigating factors were
not immediately revealed.
</P>
<P>
   All of the stations in question were using third-party list
brokers, as many nonprofit organizations do, and weren't even aware
that their lists were being shared or rented. Perhaps the most
important factor, however, is the non-political nature of the
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is ill-advised but bi-partisan behavior,'' PBS president
Ervin S. Duggan told TV critics in Pasadena, Calif.,said in
California recently. ``No station should do anything that would
call into question its independence or impartiality, but this was
not about politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The first revelation concerned list-sharing with the Democratic
Committee, but it was later learned that the Dole '96 campaign, the
conservative think-tank Heritage Foundation and other Republican
organizations were involved, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any attempt to make this seem like a one-party affair would be
a distortion of reality,'' Duggan said. ``List brokers and
fund-raisers in public TV have been quite indifferent to political
connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, public television's sometimes desperate search for
money, prompted by the ever-dwindling federal support, has nothing
to do with programming. Fund-raising departments at PBS and major
producing stations like WGBH and WNET, according to Duggan, are
separate from production and editorial operation.
</P>
<P>
   Citing shows like Armistad Maupin's ``Tales of the City,'' a
popular miniseries that included gay characters, critics have long
harped at PBS's supposedly left-leaning, liberal bias.
</P>
<P>
   But these critics fail to mention that former Reagan and Bush
(the elder) speechwriter Peggy Noonan has a PBS show, as does
conservative talk host John McLaughlin. ``Great Performances'' and
``Masterpiece Theatre'' have no political agenda; nor does ``Nova''
or ``Rumpole of the Bailey.'' Is David Attenborough a Democrat or a
Republican? Nobody knows.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that the actions of the stations' list
brokers were ill-advised, but the scandal shouldn't cast a
permanent pall over PBS.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the scandal broke, PBS told its stations that the
practice must stop. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which
oversees federal money for public TV stations, said no funds will
be given to any station unless they certify they are not exchanging
or renting their donor lists. Furthermore, sStations also were told
they must put in place privacy policies that assure donors there
will be no unauthorized use of their names.
</P>
<P>
   Some people argue that PBS should wean itself of
federalgovernment support. PBS has made great strides in producing
revenue beyond the occasional corporate grants from big oil
companies. Last year, for example, it raked in almost $85 million
in sales of videos and catalog merchandise, and next year it will
enter the audio recording industry.
</P>
<P>
   But now is not the time to end federal funding, which only
accounts for a meager 14 percent of the overall PBS budget anyway.
Right now, PBS stations are struggling with the huge expense of
readying themselves for digital transmission. To do that, they need
federal support.
</P>
<P>
   Will the donor list flap cause damage to public perception and
government support?
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin's subcommittee undoubtedly will raise questions, but
Duggan, PBS's gallant crusader and eternal optimist, doesn't think
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we put this issue in perspective and understand the
arm's length nature of list broker relationships, if we reform and
ban this practice, and if we make it clear that this does not touch
the editorial or production operations of our stations, we will
maintain the trust and esteem that is so important to us,'' Duggan
said. ``There is no need to punish by restricting the funding of
this national educational and cultural institution.''

`THE EXPERIMENT': A WORLD OF UNCANNY COINCIDENCES AND DEAD RINGERS
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Neil Gordon is the New Fiction Forum editor at The Boston
Review and author, most recently, of ``The Gun Runner's Daughter,''
a novel; publication notes at end.)

 By NEIL GORDON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The opening pages of John Darnton's second thriller are a
catalog of the impossible, incredible and entirely inexplicable. As
the plot develops, it's propelled by a series of ever more blatant
coincidences. If the suspense genre demands the illusion of an
inevitable unfolding of events toward a revelation that, no matter
how implausible, is impossible to disbelieve, ``The Experiment''
violates every tenet of the form.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it is wholly engaging, for Darnton has found a world
where fiction pales before the unbelievable truth.
</P>
<P>
   Jude Harley, a 30-year-old reporter for a New York tabloid and
part-time novelist, is assigned to cover a brutal murder. Although
the victim has been disfigured, DNA tests identify him as a New
York state judge. But Jude discovers that the judge is alive and
well. Further testing proves that the victim was, although
genetically identical to the judge, five years younger. What can it
mean?
</P>
<P>
   Jude is not allowed to find out: With suspicious alacrity and
outrageously convenient timing, his editor has transferred him to
write an article on identical twins who were separated at birth.
The research leads him to Dr. Elizabeth Tierney, Tizzie, a twins
researcher at the Rockefeller Institute with whom Jude quickly
falls in love.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on a remote island off the coast of Georgia, a colony
of young adults is being reared in a laboratory setting, and two
mavericks, Skyler and Julia, have begun to suspect that all is not
well in their little utopia. When Julia is killed and eviscerated,
as several others on the island have been, Skyler is forced to
escape the island for the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Unschooled, unused to the world, he is shunted back and forth
among the homeless until he happens to pick up a copy of USA Today
and sees a photograph of a New York novelist who looks exactly like
him, although somewhat older. The novelist? Jude Harley. Nor is
that all, for when Skyler arrives in New York to confront his
doppelganger, he finds that Tizzie is identical to his childhood
love from the laboratory, Julia.
</P>
<P>
   This run of coincidence is astonishing, but even more so is its
explanation. For this is a novel set in a world of artificially
created identical twins and, as Tizzie tells Jude during the course
of his research, the uncanny and mysterious coincidences that haunt
the lives of twins separated at birth are well documented. Such
twins are found not only to share genetic traits but to have
identical accidents and life experiences as well: They marry
similar partners, favor the same brands of toothpaste and share the
same politics.
</P>
<P>
   Darnton is at his best when synthesizing and dramatizing
extensive research, as in his best-selling first novel,
``Neanderthal.'' This has its dangers: When journalists turn to
fiction, the first hurdle is that of abandoning the reporter's
reliance on fact in favor of the authenticity of the imagination.
But Darnton, the cultural news editor of The New York Times, neatly
slips out of his research and into a densely imagined universe,
telling his story with abandon and infectious pleasure, so that the
mysteries of his tale are far more pressing than the enigmas of his
research.
</P>
<P>
   How are Jude and Skyler, identical to each other but separated
by a few years in age, related? Or Tizzie and Julia? How are they
all connected to the bizarre and brutal series of murders that
surround them? Who are the laboratory ``orderlies'' (three violent,
massive and identical psychopaths) who are pursuing them? And why
will the FBI not help? To answer any of these questions is to give
away twists and turns that Jude, Skyler and Tizzie must navigate
until the horror of the experiment that rules their lives is
revealed.
</P>
<P>
   When a thriller succeeds as a novel rather than as merely a
diversion, it is invariably due to the author's skills of
characterization more than the ingenuity of the plotting. ``The
Experiment'' succeeds only so far as its characters engage us. In
the first part of the book, Jude, with his wry reflections on
newspaper reporters and _ particularly funny _ on newspaper
editors, is, if not the equal of Philip Marlowe or Tom Ripley,
certainly as compelling as Robert B. Parker's Spenser or Patricia
Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta. He's complex and original enough even to
draw us into the absorbing question of high vs. low art, which
cannot fail to occur to the reader when a Pulitzer Prize- and
George Polk Award-winning journalist (Darnton has won both) sets
out to write a mass-market thriller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not that kind of a writer,'' Jude explains to a reader who
has criticized his grammar. ``What kind are you?'' she asks, to
which he replies: ``A people's writer. Nongrammatical. Idiomatic.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the story reaches its end, pure plot tends occasionally
to overshadow the characters. Jude and his comrades become slightly
generic: Jude loses his cynical humor, Tizzie gives no sense
whatsoever of being a doctor. Other disturbing problems detract
from the book's momentum: props (a cellular telephone, a notebook
computer) appear conveniently out of nowhere; and a much too long
and winding pursuit brings us to a much too predictable close.
</P>
<P>
   These are, however, small faults of performance rather than the
more damning literary failures of misplaced ambition or integrity.
This is a book that, at its best, seems to aim for the American
ideal of Dashiell Hammett and Patricia Highsmith, maverick writers
who saw in commercial fiction the chance to tell both meaningful
and accessible stories. It demonstrates that to make a thriller a
work of complex fiction does not mean, as Jude seems to imply,
filling it with grammatical niceties or literary prose. It means
infusing the form with as much meaning _ moral, political,
emotional _ as the characters have depth to experience and the
author has the heart to explore.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For unwary users of a government satellite system that guides
ships and airplanes, keeps cellular networks humming and helps
surveyors lay out property lines, next weekend could be marred by a
disorienting flashback.
</P>
<P>
   The global positioning system, or GPS, blends signals from
satellites to pinpoint the location of a radio receiver _ and
anyone or anything holding it _ to within 50 yards or so. Where
support from ground stations is added, the question of ``Where am
I?'' can be answered within inches. The satellite signals also
answer the question ``What time is it?'' down to tiny fractions of
a second.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the system's dazzling effectiveness depends in
part on a bare-bones calendar that boils passing time down to the
weeks since Jan. 6, 1980 _ currently 1,023 _ plus seconds. Sticking
to such basics allows the satellites to communicate quickly, but
the system is about to run out of the allotted digital space for
such timekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   The limit will become apparent all over the world 13 seconds
before 7 p.m. EDT on Saturday. Like a car's odometer reaching
100,000 miles, the system's week count will revert to zero instead
of moving to 1024.
</P>
<P>
   There are ``some unknowns and uncertainties'' about what happens
next, warned John Lovell, director of quality for Trimble
Navigation Ltd., a leading manufacturer of global positioning
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Some confused receivers will stop working. Others will generate
bad data or display 1980 dates. Still others, peering at the spots
in the skies where the satellites were in January 1980, will spend
hours trying to lock on to the signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Users should not rely on GPS where there is a risk to life,
critical data or property,'' Lovell said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that for the 24 satellites broadcasting the signals
and for the Defense Department ground stations that control the
system, the rollover will be a nonevent, like the hands on a watch
sweeping past 12. They also expect smooth sailing for well over 90
percent of the estimated 8 million global positioning radio
receivers in government and civilian hands.
</P>
<P>
   But some receivers, especially older models, read Week 0 as that
long ago week in early 1980 when the calendar started ticking. No
one knows how many receiver owners with defective equipment have
ignored or missed warnings to prepare for the rollover. Lovell and
others believe tens of thousands of malfunctions are quite
possible, perhaps more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to know what will happen with a device is to
check with the manufacturer,'' said Lt. Lee Putnam, spokesman for
the U.S. Coast Guard Navigational Center in Arlington, Va. ``You
have to have the serial number as well as the model since some
models were modified to become compliant during production.''
</P>
<P>
   Some manufacturers are charging customers for upgrades, a
practice that plaintiffs' lawyers are gearing up to challenge, said
Salvatore Graziano, a lawyer with the class-action firm of Milberg,
Weiss Bershad Hynes &AMP; Lerach in New York. Milberg and others have
filed similar lawsuits against software companies that have
required customers to pay for Year 2000 upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   The government has warned in general terms that the global
positioning rollover poses ``serious hazards.'' In some of the
worst scenarios envisioned privately by officials, boaters foolish
enough to rely solely on recreational GPS navigation in foggy
conditions could run aground. Businesses like cellular networks
that rely on GPS signals to synchronize electronic equipment or
banks that use them to time-stamp transactions could be disrupted
if faulty equipment has not been upgraded or backed up with other
high-precision clocks.
</P>
<P>
   But experts say the potential global positioning rollover
problems are much more limited than the Year 2000 challenge, are
easier to isolate and, perhaps most important, generally simple to
overcome. Gartner Group, an information technology consulting firm
in Stamford, Conn., concluded that 40 percent of the faulty
equipment manufactured before 1996 could be fixed by simply turning
it off and then starting it up again after the rollover.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that most of the industry's growth has come in the past
five years as demand surged for consumer applications like
electronic mapping systems for cars. The government's published
system specifications began explicitly noting the rollover date as
early as 1993 and the vast majority of equipment made since then
took it into account.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there were probably products shipped as late as this year
that are at risk since they may have incorporated older
programming,'' warned Lovell.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, airplanes, ships and other major users of global
positioning navigation systems are designed with other aids like
radar. They can function safely even if the global positioning
system fails completely. And businesses with major applications
have reportedly been aggressively testing their systems.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We've been deluged with requests for testing help,'' said
Charles Fay, vice president of worldwide sales for Global
Simulation Systems Inc. of Fort Worth, Texas, the leading
manufacturer of equipment that simulates the GPS satellite network.
</P>
<P>
   In most companies, the same information technology departments
leading the Year 2000 repair effort are also dealing with the
satellite rollover. Defense Department agencies gearing up for any
unanticipated problems during the rollover are using the weekend as
a dry run for the contingency plans for dealing with computer
disruptions over the New Year weekend, according to Col. James
Armor, director of the joint armed forces office in Los Angeles
that oversees the system.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the satellite transition turns out to be smooth,
government officials are cautioning against reading too much into a
smooth transaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``People shouldn't get a false sense of security about the Year
2000 if there are no major rollover problems,'' said John Gribben,
spokesman for the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion.
``They are two separate issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that many people are treating them that way. The council
itself is providing rollover information on its information hot
line (888 USA-4Y2K) and Trimble Navigation, based in Sunnyvale,
Calif., calls the rollover a ``dress rehearsal for the Year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   In part because public fears about the behavior of
high-technology systems have been heightened by publicity about
Y2K, as the Year 2000 computer problem is known, equipment
manufacturers have prepared for a flood of rollover inquiries with
briefings for dealers and customer support centers on alert.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Hunter, vice president and general manager of Magellan
Systems of Santa Clara, Calif., a subsidiary of Orbital Sciences
Corp. that is among the leading makers of hand-held GPS receivers
popular with boaters and hikers, said, ``We won't go home Friday
night assuming everything is going to be OK.''

BOOK SALES GREW 4 PERCENT LAST YEAR, STUDY SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After struggling through a drought in the mid-1990s, when
readers bought fewer copies of consumer books, the publishing
industry posted gains of more than 4 percent last year and is
poised for more modest increases despite the rapid emergence of
online booksellers.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual snapshot of the word trade, the Book Industry
Study Group issued cautious sales projections for the glamour side
of trade publishing, which produces novels and nonfiction, and a
more radiant view of the future for college textbooks and business
titles.
</P>
<P>
   The unit sales of adult trade books are projected to grow more
than 2 percent annually through the year 2003 _ an indication that
online sales are not expected to increase the market for popular
books.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see the total market expanding in any dramatic shape
for five years,'' said Albert Greco, an associate professor of
business at Fordham University who helped prepare the projections.
``If you say 10 years, it might be even more modest. I think people
are reading less, and I just don't see that we're going to turn the
corner and become a nation of readers.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the sales of adult hard-cover and trade paperback books
_ the top moneymakers for trade publishers _ rose by more than 4
percent from a year earlier, to 497 million copies. It was the
second year of growth in unit sales after a two-period ending in
1996 when consumers cut back on their purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Children's books also made gains, emerging from a 1997 slump to
sell more than 364 million copies in 1998, a gain of 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The study does not include figures for 1999, but several top
publishers say they are experiencing a surge in sales that
encompasses not only popular fare like ``Hannibal'' by Thomas
Harris or the ``Harry Potter'' children's series by J.K. Rowling
but also histories like John Keegan's ``The First World War.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a strong market since last summer _ all publishing
divisions, all formats, all categories,'' said Peter Olson, the
chief executive of Random House, the Bertelsmann AG unit that is
the largest trade publisher in the United States. Olson gave credit
for some of the strength to online retailers that now account for
roughly 4 to 5 percent of the company's sales.
</P>
<P>
   Olson said that the company's worldwide sales of $1.6 billion
for the fiscal year that ended in June had exceeded expectations.
The North American side of the company _ in the United States and
Canada _ accounted for about 80 percent of all sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the attention that Amazon.com and
Barnesandnoble.com have generated has increased interest in books
in general, and that has led to buying not just online, but in
stores,'' Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   Using consumer diaries of book purchases, an earlier industry
study this year found that Americans bought fewer copies of books
in the same period last year. But the trade organization speculates
that the discrepancy may be because that study did not include
acquisitions made by libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Though the industry study does not predict an expansion of the
market because of online sales, its current sales figures indicate
that electronic publishing and bookselling are reshaping the market
in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the unit sales of books about science and
technology declined from a peak of 80 million copies in 1995,
falling 8 percent to 74 million copies last year. And those drops
are expected to continue, the result of a shift to electronic
publishing _ that is, distribution of books by disk, CD-ROM or over
the Internet _ by technical publishers like Bertelsmann's Springer
Verlag unit in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, Springer has transformed ``Prokaryotes,''
a four-volume $2,000 set of books about bacteria, into an
electronic version that will sell for less than half that price.
Ruediger Gebauer, Springer's chief executive, said that no one was
sure yet whether electronic publishing would expand the market. But
he expected that the electronic versions would make such books
accessible to many more people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The libraries, in theory, keep information to everybody,'' he
said. ``But in reality it's only the people who go to the library.
Online publishing opens it up to virtually everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Book Industry Study Group report also suggests that the
Internet and online book sales may figure in the continuing
fall-off in mail-order purchases, which has dropped 26 percent from
a high of 105 million copies in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet does not affect all categories. Religious
books, for instance, are not sold in high volumes by electronic
booksellers, but sales in that category continue to improve,
increasing almost 16 percent, to 170 million copies since 1993. And
those numbers do not include sales figures from thriving
fundamentalist Christian publishers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got an aging population, and I think as people go on in
life they turn to more spiritual matters,'' said Eric Major,
director of the Doubleday religious division for Random House.
``Oddly enough, we've seen a surge in books about the lives of
saints or books about people's religious experiences. The great
thing about this area of religion publishing is that it now
includes business books, parenting books, dieting books and
relationships books.''
</P>
<P>
   The sales of textbooks for college and elementary students also
continue to grow. At the university level sales grew more than 19
percent, to 176 million copies, between 1993 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But those trends have not necessarily raised sales by the 80 or
so university presses in the United States. The sales of university
books grew by almost 4 percent to 18.5 million copies from a year
earlier. And the report projects only modest increases for the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an indication of a mature market,'' said Peter Givler,
executive director of the Association of American University
Presses, a trade organization. ``I think that it is very much a
market in turmoil. The sales for university presses have been flat
for a couple of years, and the presses are looking for new sources
of revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   Some university presses are starting to experiment by publishing
electronic journals, he said, but to date it is unclear to the
members whether online bookselling and electronic publishing will
be a boon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online bookselling has had this extraordinary growth,'' Givler
said, ``but nobody knows how that is going to play out. It seems
that everybody thinks this is a logical way to purchase books and
there ought to be some way to work it out, but we haven't found a
way to do it.''

THE REBIRTH OF VERSE: NATIONAL POETRY SLAM CELEBRATES 10TH YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Ill., Calif., Texas, N.C., Ore. Mass., N.M., Ark., N.D.)  (nk) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ They tore the trophy in half. When teams of exhorting,
exuberantly defiant performance poets from San Jose and San
Francisco finished the 10th annual National Poetry Slam in a tie
(ahead of the other finalists, from New York City and Oakland,
Calif.) on Saturday night, they sealed the contest more like
compassionate artists than cutthroat competitors and split the
title, ripping the trophy, a stack of books with a boxing glove
glued on top.
</P>
<P>
   Mad dancing ensued onstage. And pandemonium _ more pandemonium _
reigned at the mammoth Chicago Theater here, among the nearly 3,000
spectators who had spent the evening screaming and hooting (``You
go, girl!'' ``Change the judges!'') and bellowing in support of
their favorite poems and poets.
</P>
<P>
   The poets had declaimed their identity: ``My name is Big Poppa
E, and I am a Wussy Boy!'' declared a poet from the winning San
Francisco team. They had declaimed their spiritual angst. ``God is
a blooz man!'' declared Regie Gibson, from Chicago who, defending
his individual title, barely lost out to a poet from New York,
Roger Bonair-Agard. They had declaimed their love of poems. ``I've
decided I don't want to be a poet who just writes for the slam
anymore,'' began Staceyann Chin, another New Yorker, who concluded:
``I want to write real poems ... that are so honest they slam.''
And most of all perhaps they declaimed their birthright: to be
heard. Ariana Waynes, a poet from San Francisco declared:
</P>
<P>
   would you have me forget
</P>
<P>
   that the blessed first amendment of these united
</P>
<P>
   states that I can raise my voice to shake the world
</P>
<P>
   or at least the termite-infested foundation
</P>
<P>
   of this atrocious, ferocious
</P>
<P>
   land that I love
</P>
<P>
   but have never been exactly proud of.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else it all meant, it is evident that slam poetry has
come of age. For its 10th year the national slam returned to the
city where slamming was born. And the four-day event (preliminary
rounds were sprinkled over half a dozen bars and cabarets) was
raucous and well attended throughout, replete with the celebratory
atmosphere of a circus.
</P>
<P>
   As poetry in general has surged in popularity in the United
States, this offshoot from the traditions of the art has emerged as
a way for passionate people _ mostly, but not entirely, young and
representing a wide ethnic and racial range _ to air their voices
and for an evidently eager audience to hear and embrace them. A
weird and lively amalgam of performance art, hip-hop concert and,
with its randomly selected judges holding up numerical score cards
from the audience, Olympic figure skating, it's a form that is
still disdained by many.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists find it dull that so much of slam poetry
revolves around personal narrative or indignant protest, and they
revile the ideas that the quality of a poem is quantifiable and
that the enterprise of art-making distinguishes between winners and
losers.
</P>
<P>
   But as slammers are fond of responding, ``They don't like what
they can't do,'' and in any case, slamming is a bona fide cultural
force. It is a grass-roots movement, truly national, that since a
Chicago poet named Marc Smith held the first competitions in a bar
called Get Me High in 1984 has grown to encompass regular events in
more than 100 places in dozens of cities around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon has created a subculture with the feel of a
counterculture, complete with shrines (places like the Green Mill
Tavern here, where Smith has held Sunday night slams since 1986;
and the Nuyorican Poets Cafe in the East Village in Manhattan) and
icons, the most legendary being Patricia Smith, who is better known
in more mainstream circles as the Boston Globe columnist dismissed
a year ago after admitting to fictionalizing some columns.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1991 I saw Patricia Smith perform and it changed my life,''
said Danny Solis, 40, who, representing Albuquerque, N.M., was
competing in his seventh national slam. ``She showed me that poetry
could be something that lifts an audience to another place, like
jazz or salsa or dance.''
</P>
<P>
   The first national slam, in 1990, pitted teams from Chicago and
San Francisco against each other in one-on-one battle (Chicago, the
visiting team, won). This year's event included 200 poets
representing 48 teams from 45 cities, including three from New
York, two from Chicago and single teams from places like Chico,
Calif., Hot Springs, Ark., and Fargo, N.D., where the individual
poets earned the right to be here by winning competitions at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scoring is just a way of giving people credit for what
they do,'' said Kristen Garaas, 24, an eighth-grade English teacher
on the Fargo team. ``I feel like what we're competing for is space,
the opportunity to speak, just the way every poet does when they
try to find a publisher.''
</P>
<P>
   The format is this: Each bout has four rounds, and each member
of each four-poet team performs a poem of three minutes or less.
Singing is allowed; props are not. Five judges from the audiences,
whose standards are known only to themselves, rate the poems from
0.0 to 10.0. The highest and lowest scores are discarded, and the
sum of the middle three is the individual score; the sum of the
individual scores is the team score.
</P>
<P>
   Judges seem to be influenced by the crowd, which tends not to
appreciate low scores. This is both pertinent and not. Although no
one really doubts that the competitive aspects of slamming add a
nutty, crowd-revving element that helps draw spectators, it's also
undeniable that the connection between the poets and their
audiences is palpable, and at the heart of the experience for both.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first one we saw, we were totally awestruck,'' said
Margaret Barber, a Scrabble tournament organizer from Kearny, N.J.,
who, with her companion, Vince Anzalone from Brooklyn, has traveled
to every national slam over the last eight years. She added: ``We
heard Indians from North Dakota, we heard blacks from the inner
city, we heard every ethnic group you could imagine. There was
something different every three minutes, and everyone was so good
it was better than a Broadway show. I was never so awake in my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The rise of slam poetry has both shared in and pushed along a
general explosion in the interest of poetry nationwide,
determinable by a number of measures. The Academy of American
Poets, a 65-year-old organization in Manhattan devoted to promoting
the art of poetry, has had a fivefold increase in membership (to
10,000 from 2,000) since 1994. Bill Wadsworth, the academy's
executive director, said that when the group began sponsoring
poetry readings in the 1960s, the number of places where readings
were regularly held in New York City could be counted on one hand.
Today, he said, in New York City alone there are 170 places at
which to find poets and podiums.
</P>
<P>
   According to Poets House, a poetry library in Manhattan that
sponsors an annual exhibition of poetry books published in the
United States, there were 989 books of poetry _ individual
collections, anthologies and chapbooks _ published by 466 different
publishers last year, up from 570 titles in 1993. Barnes &AMP; Noble,
the nation's largest book retailer, which stocks 7,500 poetry
titles, says it has seen sales of poetry books rise by 30 percent
in the last three years. And City Lights Booksellers in San
Francisco, whose stock of 3,500 to 4,000 titles makes it perhaps
the most avid independent retailer of poetry, says it has had a 60
percent increase in poetry sales in the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just from watching who comes into the store, there is a real
emergence of a younger audience for poetry we haven't seen
before,'' said Paul Yamazaki, the buyer for City Lights.
</P>
<P>
   A number of factors are responsible for the trend, including the
rise of rap music, the boom in stand-up comedy and the
proliferation of stage monologuists, all of which have made the
spoken word an entertainment medium. Booksellers cite the emergence
of pop culture figures like the young singer Jewel, who have
published their verse; the establishment, four years ago, by the
Academy of American Poets of National Poetry Month, which, with its
annual attendant publicity has caused poetry sales to spike each
April in bookstores around the country; and the efforts of the poet
laureate Robert Pinsky, notably his Favorite Poem Project, an audio
and video archive of a cross-section of Americans reading their
favorite poems.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has expanded the popular notion of what poetry is
and as a result has brought a wider public to a form long
associated with intimidating erudition.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happened to poetry in the last 20 years is that it has
become so vast and with so many people practicing it that poetry
itself has become a category like dance, which includes ballet and
break dancing and so forth,'' said Eliot Weinberger, an essayist
and translator. ``So people who practice poetry for the page have
trouble with slam poetry, which is really an oral art, influenced
by performance art and rock and all that. But for them to say slam
is not poetry is like a ballet dancer saying break dancing is not
dance.''
</P>
<P>
   The reading (the melding of the poem and the performance) is at
the center of poetry's current popularity. Debra Williams, the
director of corporate communications for Barnes &AMP; Noble, attributes
the rise in poetry sales to the readings now frequently held in
many stores. And Wadsworth of the academy concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to connect the popularity of readings to people reading
books of poetry, but it's the performance aspect that's
responsible'' for much of the surge in the interest in poetry, he
said. ``And the poetry slam, where the performance is far more
important than the text, is the ultimate expression of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Many slam poets would take issue with Wadsworth's qualifying
clause, but there is no question that in slamming, the stage is at
least as important as the page. One frequently heard tenet of slam
poetry is that the better poems tend to get the better marks;
another, often invoked by the mischievous Marc Smith, who is now
president for life of the loosely organized National Slam Poetry
Association, is that the best poet always loses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started doing it to get an audience for myself,'' said
Smith, 49, who has published one book, ``Crowdpleaser'' (Collage
Press, 1997), and who made the decision, after the second national
slam in Chicago, to hold it in other cities to facilitate the
spread of the form. It has since been held in, among other places,
Cambridge, Mass., Portland, Ore., Asheville, N.C., and Austin,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt he had invented a new art form, Smith called
his invention ``a new form of show.'' He is proud of it, though he
has worries. ``I don't like the stand-up comedy style of poet, I
don't like all the `my pain' poems, and I don't like all the banal
pop culture references,'' he said. ``I started this to get away
from the TV, and now we have poems about TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly he worries that its roots are being usurped, that it's
becoming commercial. ``The revolution is becoming an institution,''
he said. Throughout the slam, various poets could be found peddling
homemade CD's. Among them, the team from the Nuyorican Poets Cafe
was actively promoting slam poetry as a profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's already possible for a slam poet to make a decent
living,'' said Faraji Salim, 24, a Nuyorican team member who said
he read several nights a week in New York City, New Jersey and
Washington, and sells his CD's afterward. ``You can move a lot of
units a night. What we're working on is how to make a six-figure
living without compromising the art.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, they haven't entirely lost the revolutionary spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing you do for yourself; slamming is for the people who
hear you,'' said another Nuyorican poet, Lamar Anthony Hill.
``Writing poetry is painful. Slamming is fun.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   America Online is the undisputed king of Internet service
providers, having added 5.1 million members in the last year alone,
for a total of more than 17 million subscribers. But its growth
rate masks a remarkable trend: The company's share of the Internet
access market is no longer growing as it once was; it may in fact
be declining.
</P>
<P>
   The market for Internet service providers, or ISPs, rather than
consolidating around America Online, Microsoft and telephone
companies like AT&AMP;T as many industry observers had predicted,
remains a diverse industry with wide-open possibilities for
competitors, including mom-and-pop operations.
</P>
<P>
   America Online's monthly subscription plan, meanwhile, is now
just one of many business models for Internet access, and new
models seem to pop up weekly. Free access, often supported by
advertising, has taken root in Europe and is spreading to the
United States. And hardware manufacturers are teaming up with ISPs
to offer a range of discounted plans.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that America Online remains the leader of the
pack. The nearest competitors, Worldnet from AT&AMP;T and MSN from
Microsoft, have fewer than 2 million members each. But research
firms generally agree that America Online's market share is not
growing the way it has in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of the wide-open nature of the Internet access market
is the beleaguered state of MSN. Its membership numbers are flat
and Microsoft admits that it is losing market share, although it
declined to release exact numbers. The company plans to beef up its
marketing budget and make a run at big growth later this summer,
said William Diefenbach, group product manager for MSN Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   The persistent _ and, in some circles, unexpected _ growth of
small local ISPs continues to make for a complex market.
</P>
<P>
   Boardwatch Magazine, a widely circulated trade journal, reports
that its directory of ISPs in Canada, the United States and the
Caribbean grew 36 percent between last October and July, to 6,511
from 4,800. Greg Tally, editor of the directory, said the increase
was partly the result of existing service providers' registering
with the directory for the first time, but he added that many were
new.
</P>
<P>
   ``There still are plenty of up-and-coming ISPs,'' he said.
``It's still exploding.''
</P>
<P>
   Most service providers are relatively small, serving several
hundred dial-up customers, Tally said. Boardwatch reports that of
the ISPs in its directory today, fully 5,895 offer local access
numbers in fewer than 25 area codes, whereas only 616 are available
in more than 25 area codes, meaning they are accessible to users on
a regional or national basis.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers may be misleading, because some small service
providers primarily serve local businesses rather than dial-up
customers like the average Web surfer. But both Tally and MSN's
Diefenbach said the small ISPs remained a powerful force in the
dial-up market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen, in aggregate, the smaller and local and regional
ISPs gaining share,'' Diefenbach said.
</P>
<P>
   Access Internet Communications Inc., a small service provider
with several thousand customers in Cupertino, Calif., says it has
seen its dial-up subscriber base grow by 25 percent a year. James
Thomatos, the company's vice president of sales and marketing, said
the demand for access was so great that there were plenty of new
customers to be shared among ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   But he said small service providers were also attracting
customers because they offered more personalized service than the
big services. ``When you call here, someone answers the phone,'' he
said. ``Have you ever tried to do business with the phone company?
It's not the easiest thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating the market are efforts to offer free
Internet access, a concept already popular in Europe and making its
first major wave in the United States with a company called Netzero
Inc. In the last six months, Netzero, based in West Lake Village,
Calif., has grown faster than any other service provider in the
country, with the exception of America Online. Last October it had
100,000 subscribers. It now claims 1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We add one every 13 seconds,'' said Mark Goldston, the
company's chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Netzero plans to make money by showing targeted advertisements
in a box that is always present on its subscribers' screens.
Netzero filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July
14 for an initial public offering of stock, which is likely to take
place before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Alta Vista, a search engine and portal owned by Compaq Computer,
last Thursday began offering free, ad-supported Internet service.
The company will use the service to drive traffic to its Web sites,
increasing advertising income. Even Microsoft has recently talked
about offering cheap or free access, but it has not disclosed solid
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts, some of whom have expressed skepticism about
the idea of free access in the past, say the idea's time may have
come. ``The price is going toward zero,'' said Drew Ianni, an
analyst for Jupiter Communications, a New York-based market
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of businesses are offering free computers as an
enticement to sign subscribers up for Internet service, but this
model is unproven. In a variation on this theme, Microworkz.com
Corp. is selling a computer for $299 with a year of free Internet
access included. After its partnership with Earthlink Network Inc.
fell apart amid an exchange of lawsuits earlier this month,
Microworkz teamed up with AT&AMP;T to provide the Internet-access part
of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Ianni says that consolidation is imminent and that AT&AMP;T, America
Online or MSN will begin to snap up large ISPs like Earthlink and
Mindspring Enterprises Inc. ``We're in the lull before a firestorm
of acquisitions,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Market research firms cannot agree on whether the market share
of industry leaders is dipping, rising slightly or holding steady.
One firm, Cahners In-Stat Group, reported this month that America
Online's market share dipped over the last year to 21.5 percent
from 24.3 percent. It estimated the total number of Internet
accounts in the United States at 66 million.
</P>
<P>
   IDC, another market research firm, estimates that America
Online's market share has dropped to 39.3 percent from 42.1 percent
in the last year, and that MSN dropped to 4 percent from 5.9
percent. It puts the size of the Internet access market at just 37
million accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Schuler, president of America Online's interactive
services group, said its ``market share has been steady.'' He
argued that it was a testimony to the online service's strength
that no other major ISP had broken out of the pack to claim even a
strong second place.
</P>
<P>
   Schuler added that America Online, which charges $22 a month for
unlimited access, does not feel threatened by the free services. He
said he did not believe they could attract enough advertising to
make the business profitable. ``It's not a business model,'' he
said.

BRITISH AIR THREATENS SUIT AGAINST RIVALS AND PLANS CUTBACKS 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British Airways PLC confirmed Sunday that it was
considering bringing lawsuits against several of its European
competitors over incentives to travel agents and that it would cut
some jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the airline, Europe's largest, was fined 4.4 million
pounds, or about $7 million, by the European Commission for abusing
its dominant market position by paying higher commissions to travel
agents in return for promoting British Airways over other airlines.
Many of the carrier's rivals have similar programs, and British
Airways said it had been singled out unfairly and planned to go
after its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very seriously considering lawsuits,'' a spokeswoman,
Louise Evans, said, confirming a report in The Sunday Times of
London.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways maintains that it wants to level the playing
field now that it is prohibited from offering incentive programs to
travel agents. If the airline proceeds with the lawsuits, it would
sue big European carriers like KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Lufthansa,
Air France and Alitalia in their home countries.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, British Airways said it would eliminate jobs as it
tries to lower costs by $360 million. The company confirmed reports
in The Sunday Times and The Observer that it will lay off workers,
but declined to specify how many.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, British Airways reported its worst fiscal quarter in
seven years as profits fell 84 percent. It cited discount fares and
a decline in the number of first- and business-class passengers.
The company said it would reduce capacity by 12 percent to lower
costs and move from using larger planes to smaller ones to improve
the percentage of seats filled on flights.

ADVERTISING COLUMN: OGILVY MAKING FOUNDER'S SIGNATURE ITS BRAND
NAME
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A division of Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide in New York
is seeking to raise its profile by doing the same for its parent.
</P>
<P>
   The division is the Brand Integration Group, which works on
assignments in areas like design, corporate identity and packaging
for clients including American Express, IBM, Mattel and Sears,
Roebuck. Such tasks are becoming increasingly important as
marketers look for campaigns that offer significant elements beyond
the trappings of traditional advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just about commercials anymore,'' said Brian Collins,
senior partner and creative director for design and brand identity
at the division. ``Everything the agency does must be part of every
place where the consumer comes into contact with the brand, moving
away from being an advertising agency to being a branding
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Tuesday, the Brand Integration Group is introducing
the results of a project undertaken for the agency: the remaking of
the corporate identity of Ogilvy &AMP; Mather. The signature of the
founder, David Ogilvy, is becoming the signature of the agency as
the Ogilvy name, in his own handwriting, is adopted as its logo.
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy &AMP; Mather executives are also asking that the agency be
referred to colloquially as Ogilvy, a moniker that is already in
use along with the initials O&AMP;M The formal, official name will
continue to be Ogilvy &AMP; Mather.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about `brand stewardship' and we don't have it,'' said
Rick Boyko, co-president at the Ogilvy New York office and chief
creative officer at Ogilvy North America. Boyko's reference was to
the philosophy the agency espouses, centered on a comprehensive
approach to selling brands to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inherent in this is the idea of going back to who we are,'' he
added, ``having an identity that sparks a rejuvenation of David and
everything that goes with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, during a commemoration of the 50th anniversary of
Ogilvy &AMP; Mather, ``we came back to much of what David said and
wrote,'' Boyko said. ``There's a sort of reassessment when you're
50, a `Who am I? What have I done?'''
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion was that ``there's a great equity here,'' he
added, ``from David's driving force, his great legacy. So let's
bring it to the forefront.''
</P>
<P>
   David Ogilvy, who founded Ogilvy &AMP; Mather in 1948, died on July
21 at 88. It is coincidental that the project, in development for
more than a year, is getting under way so soon after David Ogilvy's
death.
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy &AMP; Mather, now owned by WPP Group PLC, is the second giant
agency to tinker recently with its informal name. D'Arcy Masius
Benton &AMP; Bowles Communications in New York, the flagship of
MacManus Group, is asking to be called D'Arcy rather than DMB&AMP;B
Another big agency has actually changed its name: DDB Worldwide in
New York, part of Omnicom Group, which had been known as DDB
Needham.
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy &AMP; Mather's decision to go by only the Ogilvy name ``is
great,'' said Richard B. Fizdale, chairman and chief executive at
the Leo Burnett Co. in Chicago, another huge agency that venerates
its founder through an elaborate corporate identity program.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett paid homage to David Ogilvy last week with an
advertisement in the trade publications Advertising Age and Adweek.
The first line of the ad, which was the brainchild of a Burnett art
director, Frank Scotti, read ``David Ogilvy 1911- ,'' implying he
was still alive. Under that was the sentence ``Great brands live
forever'' and the Burnett logo, the signature of Leo Burnett, who
was for many years a friendly competitor of David Ogilvy's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've embraced the truth about the brand known as Ogilvy:
humor, uniqueness, boldness, individuality,'' said Judd Harner,
senior partner and managing director for brand strategy and client
services at the Brand Integration Group. The new logo will appear
on everything from stationery to visitors' passes to business
cards, he added.
</P>
<P>
   That echoes the work the Brand Integration Group has produced
for paying clients like Jaguar, the luxury car line owned by the
Ford Motor Co. A brand identity program carrying the theme ``A
Jaguar is a copy of nothing'' extends from brochures for consumers
to posters for dealer showroom walls to trade show exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   There are even pocket-sized cards issued to all Jaguar
employees, describing what is said to compose ``the Jaguar
essence.'' Printed on the cards are words like ``elegant,''
``sensuous,'' ``original,'' ``refined'' and ``power.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm. Or are those the words to be listed on the pocket-sized
cards that will someday be issued to all Ogilvy employees
describing ``the David Ogilvy essence''?

THE REBIRTH OF VERSE: NATIONAL POETRY SLAM CELEBRATES 10TH YEAR

<P>
   CHICAGO _ They tore the trophy in half. When teams of exhorting,
exuberantly defiant performance poets from San Jose and San
Francisco finished the 10th annual National Poetry Slam in a tie
(ahead of the other finalists, from New York City and Oakland,
Calif.) on Saturday night, they sealed the contest more like
compassionate artists than cutthroat competitors and split the
title, ripping the trophy, a stack of books with a boxing glove
glued on top.
</P>
<P>
   Mad dancing ensued onstage. And pandemonium _ more pandemonium _
reigned at the mammoth Chicago Theater here, among the nearly 3,000
spectators who had spent the evening screaming and hooting (``You
go, girl!'' ``Change the judges!'') and bellowing in support of
their favorite poems and poets.
</P>
<P>
   The poets had declaimed their identity: ``My name is Big Poppa
E, and I am a Wussy Boy!'' declared a poet from the winning San
Francisco team. They had declaimed their spiritual angst. ``God is
a blooz man!'' declared Regie Gibson, from Chicago who, defending
his individual title, barely lost out to a poet from New York,
Roger Bonair-Agard. They had declaimed their love of poems. ``I've
decided I don't want to be a poet who just writes for the slam
anymore,'' began Staceyann Chin, another New Yorker, who concluded:
``I want to write real poems ... that are so honest they slam.''
And most of all perhaps they declaimed their birthright: to be
heard. Ariana Waynes, a poet from San Francisco declared:
</P>
<P>
   would you have me forget
</P>
<P>
   that the blessed first amendment of these united
</P>
<P>
   states that I can raise my voice to shake the world
</P>
<P>
   or at least the termite-infested foundation
</P>
<P>
   of this atrocious, ferocious
</P>
<P>
   land that I love
</P>
<P>
   but have never been exactly proud of.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else it all meant, it is evident that slam poetry has
come of age. For its 10th year the national slam returned to the
city where slamming was born. And the four-day event (preliminary
rounds were sprinkled over half a dozen bars and cabarets) was
raucous and well attended throughout, replete with the celebratory
atmosphere of a circus.
</P>
<P>
   As poetry in general has surged in popularity in the United
States, this offshoot from the traditions of the art has emerged as
a way for passionate people _ mostly, but not entirely, young and
representing a wide ethnic and racial range _ to air their voices
and for an evidently eager audience to hear and embrace them. A
weird and lively amalgam of performance art, hip-hop concert and,
with its randomly selected judges holding up numerical score cards
from the audience, Olympic figure skating, it's a form that is
still disdained by many.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists find it dull that so much of slam poetry
revolves around personal narrative or indignant protest, and they
revile the ideas that the quality of a poem is quantifiable and
that the enterprise of art-making distinguishes between winners and
losers.
</P>
<P>
   But as slammers are fond of responding, ``They don't like what
they can't do,'' and in any case, slamming is a bona fide cultural
force. It is a grass-roots movement, truly national, that since a
Chicago poet named Marc Smith held the first competitions in a bar
called Get Me High in 1984 has grown to encompass regular events in
more than 100 places in dozens of cities around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon has created a subculture with the feel of a
counterculture, complete with shrines (places like the Green Mill
Tavern here, where Smith has held Sunday night slams since 1986;
and the Nuyorican Poets Cafe in the East Village in Manhattan) and
icons, the most legendary being Patricia Smith, who is better known
in more mainstream circles as the Boston Globe columnist dismissed
a year ago after admitting to fictionalizing some columns.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1991 I saw Patricia Smith perform and it changed my life,''
said Danny Solis, 40, who, representing Albuquerque, N.M., was
competing in his seventh national slam. ``She showed me that poetry
could be something that lifts an audience to another place, like
jazz or salsa or dance.''

   The first national slam, in 1990, pitted teams from Chicago and
San Francisco against each other in one-on-one battle (Chicago, the
visiting team, won). This year's event included 200 poets
representing 48 teams from 45 cities, including three from New
York, two from Chicago and single teams from places like Chico,
Calif., Hot Springs, Ark., and Fargo, N.D., where the individual
poets earned the right to be here by winning competitions at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scoring is just a way of giving people credit for what
they do,'' said Kristen Garaas, 24, an eighth-grade English teacher
on the Fargo team. ``I feel like what we're competing for is space,
the opportunity to speak, just the way every poet does when they
try to find a publisher.''
</P>
<P>
   The format is this: Each bout has four rounds, and each member
of each four-poet team performs a poem of three minutes or less.
Singing is allowed; props are not. Five judges from the audiences,
whose standards are known only to themselves, rate the poems from
0.0 to 10.0. The highest and lowest scores are discarded, and the
sum of the middle three is the individual score; the sum of the
individual scores is the team score.
</P>
<P>
   Judges seem to be influenced by the crowd, which tends not to
appreciate low scores. This is both pertinent and not. Although no
one really doubts that the competitive aspects of slamming add a
nutty, crowd-revving element that helps draw spectators, it's also
undeniable that the connection between the poets and their
audiences is palpable, and at the heart of the experience for both.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first one we saw, we were totally awestruck,'' said
Margaret Barber, a Scrabble tournament organizer from Kearny, N.J.,
who, with her companion, Vince Anzalone from Brooklyn, has traveled
to every national slam over the last eight years. She added: ``We
heard Indians from North Dakota, we heard blacks from the inner
city, we heard every ethnic group you could imagine. There was
something different every three minutes, and everyone was so good
it was better than a Broadway show. I was never so awake in my
life.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The rise of slam poetry has both shared in and pushed along a
general explosion in the interest of poetry nationwide,
determinable by a number of measures. The Academy of American
Poets, a 65-year-old organization in Manhattan devoted to promoting
the art of poetry, has had a fivefold increase in membership (to
10,000 from 2,000) since 1994. Bill Wadsworth, the academy's
executive director, said that when the group began sponsoring
poetry readings in the 1960s, the number of places where readings
were regularly held in New York City could be counted on one hand.
Today, he said, in New York City alone there are 170 places at
which to find poets and podiums.
</P>
<P>
   According to Poets House, a poetry library in Manhattan that
sponsors an annual exhibition of poetry books published in the
United States, there were 989 books of poetry _ individual
collections, anthologies and chapbooks _ published by 466 different
publishers last year, up from 570 titles in 1993. Barnes &AMP; Noble,
the nation's largest book retailer, which stocks 7,500 poetry
titles, says it has seen sales of poetry books rise by 30 percent
in the last three years. And City Lights Booksellers in San
Francisco, whose stock of 3,500 to 4,000 titles makes it perhaps
the most avid independent retailer of poetry, says it has had a 60
percent increase in poetry sales in the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just from watching who comes into the store, there is a real
emergence of a younger audience for poetry we haven't seen
before,'' said Paul Yamazaki, the buyer for City Lights.
</P>
<P>
   A number of factors are responsible for the trend, including the
rise of rap music, the boom in stand-up comedy and the
proliferation of stage monologuists, all of which have made the
spoken word an entertainment medium. Booksellers cite the emergence
of pop culture figures like the young singer Jewel, who have
published their verse; the establishment, four years ago, by the
Academy of American Poets of National Poetry Month, which, with its
annual attendant publicity has caused poetry sales to spike each
April in bookstores around the country; and the efforts of the poet
laureate Robert Pinsky, notably his Favorite Poem Project, an audio
and video archive of a cross-section of Americans reading their
favorite poems.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has expanded the popular notion of what poetry is
and as a result has brought a wider public to a form long
associated with intimidating erudition.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happened to poetry in the last 20 years is that it has
become so vast and with so many people practicing it that poetry
itself has become a category like dance, which includes ballet and
break dancing and so forth,'' said Eliot Weinberger, an essayist
and translator. ``So people who practice poetry for the page have
trouble with slam poetry, which is really an oral art, influenced
by performance art and rock and all that. But for them to say slam
is not poetry is like a ballet dancer saying break dancing is not
dance.''
</P>
<P>
   The reading (the melding of the poem and the performance) is at
the center of poetry's current popularity. Debra Williams, the
director of corporate communications for Barnes &AMP; Noble, attributes
the rise in poetry sales to the readings now frequently held in
many stores. And Wadsworth of the academy concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to connect the popularity of readings to people reading
books of poetry, but it's the performance aspect that's
responsible'' for much of the surge in the interest in poetry, he
said. ``And the poetry slam, where the performance is far more
important than the text, is the ultimate expression of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Many slam poets would take issue with Wadsworth's qualifying
clause, but there is no question that in slamming, the stage is at
least as important as the page. One frequently heard tenet of slam
poetry is that the better poems tend to get the better marks;
another, often invoked by the mischievous Marc Smith, who is now
president for life of the loosely organized National Slam Poetry
Association, is that the best poet always loses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started doing it to get an audience for myself,'' said
Smith, 49, who has published one book, ``Crowdpleaser'' (Collage
Press, 1997), and who made the decision, after the second national
slam in Chicago, to hold it in other cities to facilitate the
spread of the form. It has since been held in, among other places,
Cambridge, Mass., Portland, Ore., Asheville, N.C., and Austin,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt he had invented a new art form, Smith called
his invention ``a new form of show.'' He is proud of it, though he
has worries. ``I don't like the stand-up comedy style of poet, I
don't like all the `my pain' poems, and I don't like all the banal
pop culture references,'' he said. ``I started this to get away
from the TV, and now we have poems about TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly he worries that its roots are being usurped, that it's
becoming commercial. ``The revolution is becoming an institution,''
he said. Throughout the slam, various poets could be found peddling
homemade CD's. Among them, the team from the Nuyorican Poets Cafe
was actively promoting slam poetry as a profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's already possible for a slam poet to make a decent
living,'' said Faraji Salim, 24, a Nuyorican team member who said
he read several nights a week in New York City, New Jersey and
Washington, and sells his CD's afterward. ``You can move a lot of
units a night. What we're working on is how to make a six-figure
living without compromising the art.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, they haven't entirely lost the revolutionary spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing you do for yourself; slamming is for the people who
hear you,'' said another Nuyorican poet, Lamar Anthony Hill.
``Writing poetry is painful. Slamming is fun.''

INTERNATIONAL SLEUTHING ADDS INSIGHT ABOUT BACH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (mk) 
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The story of the long search for the musical estate of Johann
Sebastian Bach's second son, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, is straight
out of a bad Cold War novel. The estate, discovered by scholars
this summer in a Ukrainian archive, included hundreds of
unpublished scores by J.S. Bach's sons and forebears and had been
feared lost or destroyed. In fact, it has been in Ukraine ever
since the Red army took it from Germany as a trophy after World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   The search began in the 1970s when Dr. Christoph Wolff, a music
professor at Harvard University who was writing the Bach family
entry for The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, was
tipped off by a librarian in East Berlin that C.P.E. Bach's estate
was stashed somewhere in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   When he tried to learn more, he encountered two decades of
denial. He enlisted the help of Patricia Kennedy Grimsted, a
specialist in Soviet trophy archives and an associate of the
Ukrainian Research Institute at Harvard. But she too was
stonewalled.
</P>
<P>
   It was only this year that the case began to crack. In
researching her forthcoming book about war spoils, ``Trophies of
War and Empire,'' Dr. Grimsted stumbled upon a German translation
of a 1957 report by the Soviet Ministry of Culture that mentioned
some 5,100 musical manuscripts in a conservatory in Kiev. But when
the conservatory officials were questioned about the document, they
said they knew nothing about it.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Dr. Grimsted's colleague, Hennadii Boriak, the
deputy director of Ukrainian archeography and sources studies at
the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, stepped in. He found a librarian
who remembered seeing a report about a music collection being moved
in 1973 to the Central State Archive-Museum of Literature and Art
in Kiev. Archive officials confirmed that they had a collection of
some sort, but offered no further information.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, when Boriak finally got to see the collection, no
one knew what it contained. Wolff asked him after his visit, ``Does
it contain the Bach family name?''
</P>
<P>
   He responded, ``Yes, quite a few.''
</P>
<P>
   That was not the end of the maze. In June, Dr. Grimsted and
Wolff arrived in Kiev to appraise the collection and met with a
string of delays. Their first day there was a holiday. On the
second day the archive was being renovated. On the third day the
archive's director showed the scholars an inventory of the archive,
but not the collection itself.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the director, who Ms. Grimsted recalled was ``worried
that we were going to write that the material was in disrepair,''
pulled down a box. It contained about six bound manuscripts and
bore the stamp of the Berlin Sing-Akademie, the choral society that
had inherited C.P.E Bach's estate. The scholars knew they had hit
pay dirt. They had three days to examine the loot.
</P>
<P>
   About a tenth of the collection contained Bach family
manuscripts. There were a few scores by J.S. Bach. (Most of his
manuscripts have been in the state library in Berlin since 1854.)
But the bulk of the Bach booty was a collection of unpublished
manuscripts by J.S. Bach's two eldest sons, C.P.E. and Wilhelm
Friedemann, as well as music by his ancestors, making up the ``Old
Bach Archive'' that dates to a 17th-century polychoral composition
by his great grandfather, Johann Bach. There were also compositions
by Georg Telemann and other composers, as well as the originals of
Goethe's letters to the composer Carl Friedrich Zelter.
</P>
<P>
   How did this collection wind up where no one, apparently, knew
what it was? In 1943, when the bombing of Berlin began, the Berlin
Sing-Akademie collection was taken for safekeeping to a castle in
Silesia, now part of Poland. In the spring of 1945, when Soviet
trophy brigades began combing the area, a tank driver from Kiev
discovered the archive. The KGB arranged to have the material taken
to a music conservatory in Kiev, and there it stayed until 1973,
when it was moved to the state archive.
</P>
<P>
   The manuscripts, Wolff said, hold important clues about J.S.
Bach's relationship to his ancestors and sons. The music shows that
the sons were ``overwhelmed'' by their father's mastery, Wolff
noted. ``Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach wrote 20 Passions, and in many
he integrated whole movements from his father's works,'' he said,
but added that C.P.E. Bach was also bending the Passion genre.
</P>
<P>
   J.S. Bach worked side by side with his sons, Wolff said. ``He
would pick up some of the modern ideas they tried out first, a
melodic phrase that would reflect the gallant manner of the younger
generation, and he would react to it and say, `I can do it
better.'''
</P>
<P>
   Based on music the sons composed in the 1730s and '40s, Wolff
said, it is clear they were trained to be individuals, not clones
of their father. For example, Wilhelm Friedemann is less whimsical
and more difficult than C.P.E.
</P>
<P>
   What about J.S. Bach's relationship to his ancestors? He was the
family historian, Wolff said. Beginning in 1735, when his oldest
sons left home and started their careers, Bach, then 50, realized
that the family's musical tradition would continue and that he
should record its history. In keeping with the Age of
Enlightenment, when family histories became popular, J.S. Bach drew
a family tree complete with commentaries on everyone who was
musical. He singled out his uncle Johann Christoph Bach as a great
expressive composer.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not mean much, Wolff said, unless one knows what
Bach meant by ``expressive.'' Now one can make sense of Bach's
commentaries because he not only rated his ancestors, but he copied
their scores, and the copies are also part of the archive. The
music of Bach's uncles J.C. Bach and Johann Michael Bach is
virtuosic and far more demanding than that of their contemporaries
Johann Pachelbel and Dietrich Buxtehude, Wolff said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ukrainian authorities have orally agreed to let the Harvard
music department and the Ukrainian Research Institute put the
collection on microfilm, Wolff said, and he hopes to compile a
rough manuscript of the collection's music within a year so that
research can go on while the fate of the originals is decided.
</P>
<P>
   That may take a while. A few weeks ago, Dr. Grimsted said, the
Russians confirmed that they would return no war trophies to
Germany. But the Ukrainians, who are eager to forge connections
with Western Europe, seem willing to consider returning their war
spoils in exchange for the return of the few Ukrainian works left
in Germany, Wolff said. ``They have done it before,'' he said,
``and they may do it again.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruce Springsteen was 45 minutes late when he arrived at
rehearsal at the Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford,
N.J., on Thursday afternoon. He was limping, his hand was bandaged,
and he was clearly exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   In several hours, he would be performing the last of his
record-setting 15 sold-out concerts at the arena. In the last five
months he had already logged two public rehearsals in Asbury Park,
a 36-show European tour and 14 performances at this arena. One
would think he wouldn't have to rehearse anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But Springsteen, who has never shown a sense of entitlement to
his rock throne and always felt a strong accountability to his fans
_ particularly those from New Jersey, the state that he and his
songs are so strongly connected to _ wanted to make that 15th night
a little more special than those before it.
</P>
<P>
   After all, some fans had been to every show: like the luckier
characters in Springsteen's songs, they deserved a reward for their
faith and perseverance. So he rehearsed two songs the band hadn't
played yet on the entire tour: ``Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)'' and
``Jersey Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   On almost every night prior, Springsteen had ended the show with
a new, unreleased song, ``Land of Hope and Dreams.'' It was a very
appropriate and telling conclusion to the show, a happy ending of
sorts to the preceding tales of characters trying to navigate their
way through a morally, financially and emotionally uncertain world,
weighing their dreams against their reality and trying to decide
which path to follow.
</P>
<P>
   The new song ultimately gave its main characters what they
wanted, death and vindication, changing the passenger list in the
Woody Guthrie song ``This Train Is Bound for Glory'' (which only
takes ``the righteous and the holy'') to be all-inclusive (for
saints and sinners, whores and gamblers). On ``this train, dreams
will not be thwarted,'' Springsteen sang with the E Street Band.
``This train, faith will be rewarded.''
</P>
<P>
   But after ending ``Land of Hope and Dreams'' on Thursday, he
delivered a short farewell speech flattering the audience and then
put a hand to his chin and mused: ``Let me see, how can I say
thanks? Maybe just once ...'' Then he trailed off.
</P>
<P>
   Most fans knew what would come next: They had been asking for it
night after night, holding up signs pleading, ``Can Rosie come out
and play?'' only, at some shows, to be sternly told by Springsteen
that he had no intention of performing the concert classic they
were asking for.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday night he had every intention of playing it,
changing the lyric about ``the swamps of Jersey'' to ``the great
state of New Jersey.'' And when he sang the line he wrote in 1973,
``Someday we'll look back on this, and it will all seem funny,'' he
responded to his younger self, ``It is funny.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been too contrived to open on first night of the
series with ``Jersey Girl,'' a Tom Waits song. But it began
Thursday's show. In addition, during ``Hungry Heart'' Springsteen
was joined onstage by a very different native son of New Jersey,
Jon Bon Jovi (who in his days as John Bongiovi sneaked into this
very arena to see the Boss), along with guitarist Richie Sambora
and singer Melissa Etheridge.
</P>
<P>
   Though Springsteen set the record for the longest stretch of
shows at the arena with these 15 concerts, the 330,000 tickets that
were snapped up were not the most he has sold in New Jersey during
an engagement. (His six-night stand at Giants Stadium in 1985
packed in more people.) But the popularity of these performances
comes at an interesting time. In 1985 he was at the height of his
``Born in the U.S.A.''-era popularity; today, less than a month
away from his 50th birthday, most of his recent releases have been
archival.
</P>
<P>
   The complicated, morally uncertain picture that Springsteen
painted of the working class has been replaced on the pop charts by
the angry certainty of proud white-trash rebels without a cause
like Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit, whose sense of pop history stops at
early hip-hop and '70s rock. In their songs, which offer few
possibilities of redemption, the time bombs ticking in the hearts
of Springsteen's down-and-out characters are always exploding.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Springsteen's concert popularity endures because, besides
always having put on a great live show, he fills a rock-and-roll
need that no younger pop act is serving successfully. (He will most
likely return to the arena for a New Year's Eve show, though it has
not yet been announced.)
</P>
<P>
   He evokes a period of pre-psychedelic rock-and-roll that seems
to be fading from the collective pop memory. And he speaks for the
increasingly invisible backbone of America: the blue-collar
laborers, the people caught in the struggle of every day, the poor
huddled masses whose individuality he insists on (and personifies
as ``The Ghost of Tom Joad''). It is a segment of the population
that has been slowly losing its voice in popular culture in these
years of prosperous baby-boomer spending, romanticized teen-age
entertainment and Internet optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen is also necessary because he still believes in
rock-and-roll. In a mock-preacher voice each night, he offered the
audience paradise in this life through ``the ministry of
rock-and-roll.'' An early convert, he was quite literally saved by
the music when the guitar gave meaning and direction to the life of
an awkward small-town loser ostracized by his parents, his peers
and the nuns who taught at his school.
</P>
<P>
   He captured that moment with the bittersweet fondness of
hindsight at several concerts with an unreleased confessional folk
song named after the town he grew up in, ``Freehold.'' But the
rock-and-roll sermon reached its feverish peak each night when the
house lights came on during ``Born to Run.''
</P>
<P>
   Audience members, religiously rising to their feet, didn't just
remember the song, they didn't just sing it: they felt it.
``Someday girl I don't know when/ We're going to get to that place/
Where we really want to go.'' The importance of Springsteen's music
is in those four words of aspiration and ambivalence that speak to
us all, ``I don't know when.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen's 15th show at the Continental Arena was a marked
contrast from his first concert there a month earlier. On opening
night, with television cameras rolling, moguls and critics from
across the country in attendance and a lot of anticipatory hype for
the beginning of his first American tour in more than 10 years with
the E Street Band, he was somewhat stiff and visibly nervous,
though he still delivered a strong set. But as the dates
progressed, he and the band became looser, more playful, more
comfortable and more familial. One night, they celebrated the
birthday of Patti Scialfa, his wife and back-up singer and
guitarist; another night, guitarist Steve Van Zandt even brought
his cocker spaniel onstage.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's final show, Springsteen and the band walked onto
the stage as if it were their living room. More than most previous
nights, he spoke between songs, ran around, pumped his fist in the
air, interacted with the crowd and jumped on the piano (although
the shows were still shorter and less talkative and energetic than
in his younger days with the band). He also stretched out on
electric guitar, playing at least three solos, most notably during
``Prove It All Night.''
</P>
<P>
   He was more himself: serious and passionate but also goofily
self-conscious. The drummer Max Weinberg played with more precision
and ease than at any of the previous shows I'd seen, and Nils
Lofgren gave ``Youngstown'' one of its best slow-burning
guitar-solo codas.
</P>
<P>
   From night to night the structure of Springsteen's set appeared
to be the same, with a handful of gaps for new songs to be
inserted. As time progressed, material from his first two albums
(before the studio, songwriting and sales success of ``Born to
Run'') slowly crept its way into the set list.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the only stage of Springsteen's career that
wasn't represented throughout the engagement was his 1987 ``Tunnel
of Love'' album, recorded as his first marriage was dissolving.
</P>
<P>
   A reflection of the optimism that the E Street Band and his
current marriage seem to bring out of him was that instead of
performing those songs grappling with problems of domesticity and
co-dependence, he played love songs like ``Two Hearts'' and ``If I
Should Fall Behind'' (his 1992 sequel to Ben E. King's ``Stand By
Me'').
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that in 1999 _ with a $14 million home in Beverly
Hills, a place in the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame and almost a
quarter of a century of success behind him _ Springsteen is far
from the embodiment of those he sings about.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time he has gotten more than he wanted only to
discover that a dream fulfilled is no longer a dream; it is a new
and heavier weight. And in his long engagement at the Continental
Arena, he carried that weight admirably.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Rain will be scarce in much of the nation as sinking air in a
ridge of high pressure from the southern Plains to the Northeast
states suppresses clouds and showers. Very hot conditions will
persist in the southern Plains while most of the northern states
have seasonable warmth.
</P>
<P>
   After a cool dawn in interior sections, ample sunshine will
boost temperatures near or above seasonal levels in most of the
Northeast states. A few puffy clouds will form near the
Appalachians during the afternoon. Humidity will be comfortable in
most areas, but sultry air will linger along southern parts of the
Middle Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast will have plenty of sunshine, but a few isolated
thunderstorms will develop near the Gulf of Mexico and the Georgia
and South Carolina coastlines. Humidity will begin to rise across
the Tennessee Valley as a wind flow from the south increases.
</P>
<P>
   A narrow band of thunderstorms will develop from the central
Plains to the western Great Lakes as a weakening cool front lifts
humid air. Otherwise, ample sunshine will prevail from the central
Plains to the southern Great Lakes. In the wake of the front, less
humid air will surge across the Dakotas into Minnesota on breezes
from the northwest.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, a few afternoon thunderstorms will develop over the
central and southern Rockies. Otherwise, sunny and very warm
conditions will prevail. A warming trend will begin in the
Northwest, although cool air and low clouds will linger near the
Washington coast.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: HAWAIIAN HURRICANES
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Hawaiians were keeping a wary eye on two storms
swirling within 1000 miles of the island chain. A tropical
depression was weakening 700 miles south of Kauai. Meanwhile,
Hurricane Dora was moving west 500 miles southeast of Hilo. Strong
hurricanes are infrequent visitors to Hawaii, although Hurricane
Iniki slammed into Kauai in 1992. The ocean near the islands is
several degrees cooler than the 80-to-90-degree water where
hurricanes form. Deprived of energy from the warmth of the eastern
Pacific, hurricanes usually weaken as they approach Hawaii.

COMPUTING POWER PUTS VIDEO GAMES IN TELEVISION'S LEAGUE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURNABY, British Columbia _ Liam Neeson, meet Eddie Pope.
</P>
<P>
   Pope, a player for Major League Soccer's D.C. United team, may
not be as well known as Neeson. But both men are stars in
blockbuster high-technology features that have each earned well
over $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   In Pope's case, though, the feature is not a big summer film
like ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' but a
best-selling video game: FIFA Soccer, currently the most popular
title from Electronic Arts Inc., the world's largest maker of video
games. Pope spent a day here in the company's new $3.2-million
motion-capture studio in early August, going through his moves for
the next version of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to technologies like motion capture, video games
are expanding beyond their male teen-age stronghold into an
increasingly mainstream form of entertainment. In fact, the
$6.3-billion North American computer and video game industry is
closing in on Hollywood box-office revenues, which reached $6.95
billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entertainment is the 6,000-pound gorilla in the American
home,'' said Nicholas Donatiello, president of Odyssey, a San
Francisco market research firm. ``Motion capture is important
because it adds more interesting experiences that will broaden the
reach of the game industry.''
</P>
<P>
   To improve the reality in virtual reality, producers of popular
video games _ whether sports titles like FIFA Soccer and
Activision's Jack Nicklaus game or fantasy shooter games like Eidos
Interactive's Tomb Raider series _ have turned to human actors like
Pope. Last year, for example, Westwood Studios used motion capture
sequences from more than 100 actors for its video-game version of
the movie ``Blade Runner,'' including many of the film's original
cast members.
</P>
<P>
   And among the game makers, access to increasing computing power
for both video games and PC's is touching off a new race toward
realism. In this latest version of FIFA Soccer, for instance, the
producers were able to increase the video speed to 26 frames a
second for the Sony Playstation from 21. In comparison,
conventional television runs at 30 frames a second, while most
movies are shown at 24 frames a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the point where the visual resolution of our products
will soon surpass television,'' said Don Mattrick, a software game
pioneer who is now head of the Electronic Arts production studios.
``That will take our products into mainstream culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Electronic Arts, which uses motion capture for more than a dozen
sports titles and many of its other games, is seen as the leader in
this field _ in aesthetics as well as in technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to put motion capture in a larger context,'' said
Steve Eshkenazi, a veteran video game analyst who is now a partner
at Walden Media and Information, a technology and media investment
fund in San Francisco. ``Electronic Arts understands that it won't
replace great game play, but they have developed the ability to
create digital actors to enhance the game brands they have
created.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Electronic Arts is a Silicon Valley company, with
headquarters in San Mateo, Calif., its production studio is in this
suburb of Vancouver, British Columbia, which is also home to a
thriving film industry. It was here, in the early 1980s, that
Mattrick founded Distinctive Software, one of the first PC game
companies, which was acquired by Electronic Arts in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Because much of the company's production talent was already
based here, Electronic Arts built its new studio in Burnaby last
year rather than ask its programmers and artists to move to San
Mateo. Already, the company says, the Burnaby studio is the most
productive and profitable of the dozen development studios the
company has scattered among five countries.
</P>
<P>
   Capturing the raw material of FIFA Soccer resembles shooting a
scene for an action film. Garbed in a black body suit dotted with
silver reflective spheres the size of table tennis balls, Pope
looks like an alien. On a 40-square-foot patch of real grass that
has been laid in the studio for the day's shoot, he goes through
his moves, performing headers and deeks (soccer jargon for feints
or fakes). Strobe lights pulse 240 times a second as 10 specially
designed high-resolution cameras break Pope's fluid moves into
digital snapshots.
</P>
<P>
   While he kicks soccer balls into a net, two programmers watch
through the large window separating the studio from their control
room as Pope's motion data stream into a row of Silicon Graphics
work stations and other machines.
</P>
<P>
   On one monitor a small cluster of lights moves like a balletic
constellation of stars, tracking the player's movements as an
assistant tosses him a ball. Pope performs a slashing header, then
falls and rolls on a cushioned mat. Next, imagining a winning goal
scored, he springs up and bounds away in a celebratory run, arms
spread like an airplane, as if ready to hug an unseen teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, the work station has translated this
sequence into movements depicted by a three-dimensional stick
figure that repeats the header, roll and victory dance _ the
kinetic architectural framework on which computer graphics artists
will build a video animation mimicking Pope's athleticism.
</P>
<P>
   All this comes from no more than 20 points of light on the
screen, which have extracted the essence of his motion and given
the stick figure dance a remarkably lifelike fluidity. The digital
motion-capture files will now become the raw material for game
designers whose job it is to extend the illusion by enhancing the
skeletal renderings with flesh, clothing and facial expressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your eye is remarkably sensitive to motion,'' said David
Pierce, a special effects engineer who manages the studio. ``It
creates a powerful illusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Although motion capture technology was invented in the 1970s, it
was not until the early '90s that the processing power of video
game consoles began making it worth the cost and effort of
recording human movements for games. Current consoles from Sony,
Nintendo and Sega use 32-bit processors, and all three companies
have faster 64-bit consoles in the wings.
</P>
<P>
   The Electronic Arts FIFA team is eagerly awaiting this next
generation of machines, like the Sony Playstation II, which will be
introduced in Japan later this year. On that machine, the number of
polygons _ elements in the basic wire mesh used to create
three-dimensional human figures available to programmers _ will
exceed 10,000 for an individual figure, compared with 250 polygons
a player on current consoles. With that level of resolution,
programmers would be able to depict movement in a soccer player's
hair as he or she runs.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the current generation of game consoles,
Electronic Arts programmers are finding new ways to enhance the
illusory effects. FIFA 2000, to be released in November, relies
heavily on Pope's on-field movements, for example, but it also
exploits the more subliminal component of sound in an effort to
make game players feel that they are actually in a stadium watching
a game in progress.
</P>
<P>
   By the time it is ready for release this fall, the new version
will use the recorded words of 27 different announcers in nine
languages speaking 85,000 scripted words. Different disks will be
sold in different countries.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The three programmers responsible for sound and music are
seeking a leap in realism by using only complete prerecorded
phrases; in the past, the game's announcers have sounded robotic as
certain phrases are patched together from a library of words.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the game will add predictive speech by the announcers
_ phrases like ``waiting in the middle cross'' that anticipate the
action _ as well as sentences indicating an awareness of earlier
developments in the game. The number of goals a player has already
scored, for example, might prompt the programmed announcer to say,
``Ah! He's made his hat trick!'' when the player scores a third
one.
</P>
<P>
   The sound designers have also programmed in more crowd chants
and various spectator sounds that will be more responsive to the
game in progress. As Kerry Whalen, one of the FIFA producers,
observed, ``If you just scored your 19th goal against Lichtenstein,
the crowd isn't going to be very excited.''

MEDIA COLUMN: NEWSPAPER DEAL IN SAN FRANCISCO REVIVES DEBATE ABOUT
REGULATION
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember the 1970s? When sideburns, bell-bottoms and government
regulation were in fashion? When 62 million copies of the country's
1,748 daily newspapers circulated every day? When Congress, saying
it wanted to insure a diversity of editorial viewpoints, passed a
law making it easier for some financially troubled newspapers to
stay afloat?
</P>
<P>
   The Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970 fits the media world of
1999 about as well as a pair of 1970 bell-bottoms fits its original
owner. And recently many of the original rationales for the law
were stood on their heads by the proposed $660-million sale of The
San Francisco Chronicle to the Hearst Corp., owner of its
archrival, The San Francisco Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's joint operating agreement was one of 25 or more
that came and went over the years, first without federal sanction
(the prototype agreement was signed in Albuquerque, N.M., in 1933)
and, after 1970, with the government's provisional blessing.
</P>
<P>
   The structures varied, but the basic principle was the same.
Competing newspapers would share certain costs _ like printing and
distribution _ and split certain revenues, like advertising and
circulation dollars. Newsrooms and editorial pages remained
separate, ideally providing diverse viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of the San Francisco agreement leaves 12 joint
operating agreements from York, Pa., to Honolulu. Agreements, and
newspapers, have died in places like St. Louis. For some years,
many of those who study the industry _on Wall Street and in
universities _ have asked out loud if the agreements served their
stated purpose of insuring multiple editorial voices. Longtime
opponents, like Bruce B. Brugmann, the publisher of a weekly
newspaper, The San Francisco Bay Guardian, argue that the JOA's, as
they are known in the business, never insured anything but
publishers' profits. Brugmann called the Chronicle sale the
``assassination of a newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   But Donna Patterson, a deputy assistant attorney general in the
Justice Department's antitrust division, tends to think the 1970
law did some service. ``I guess historically it's been a success,''
she said, ``because it's preserved voices longer than they would
otherwise have been preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst officials refused to comment. But another publisher,
Dennis Hetzel of The York Daily Record (circulation 43,000 every
morning), which is in a joint operating agreement with the York
Dispatch (circulation 40,000 every afternoon and 93,000 on Sunday),
said the newspapers' nine-year-old joint operating agreement freed
him to invest more in the newsroom, which competes fiercely with
the newsroom of The Dispatch. ``Both newspapers are better,''
thanks to the business cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Brugmann, argue that the agreements make tame,
hand-fed creatures out of businesses that had been aggressive
business competitors. ``The publishers just don't want to
compete,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Did the law lengthen the life of some troubled newspapers? ``No
one can say for sure,'' said Stephen Barnett, a law professor at
the University of California at Berkeley. But JOAs, he said, ``have
clearly had the effect of crippling the weaker paper.'' When the
agreements end, those weaker papers tend to end with them.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Lacy, a professor of journalism at Michigan State
University, sees today's situation as the outcome of economic
forces, not misguided regulation. ``The inevitable is happening,''
he said. ``The forces that create the one-paper town were not
overcome by the Newspaper Preservation Act.'' Instead, he said, the
act just prolonged the dying of the weaker newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, the end of the joint operating agreement is
widely expected to leave the town with one daily. Who will to buy
an afternoon newspaper with a circulation one-quarter that of its
morning rival, without having the printing and distribution
capacity, or being willing to spend millions to develop it?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Veronis, Suhler &AMP; Associates, a New York investment
bank, will find a buyer for The Examiner _ maybe a small local
publisher. If it does, there will be no joint operating agreement
to shelter the new owner from the rigors of competition, as The
Chronicle and The Examiner have been sheltered since 1965. (Their
joint operating agreement was established before Congress shielded
most such arrangements from antitrust action.)
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the San Francisco agreement also made it likely
that, once The Chronicle's owners decided to sell, Hearst _ the
company with the most incentive to eliminate one newspaper _ would
be the most likely buyer. It had the right of first refusal,
according to one person who has seen the agreement, and its $660
million bid came four days before other companies' bids were
formally due, pre-empting potential rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors aiding Hearst had nothing to do with well-meaning
economic regulation. As a privately held company, Hearst has no
stockholders to answer to, while most other potential bidders did.
And Wall Street, in recent years, has frowned on newspaper
companies that make expensive acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   But in the world of 1999, does the loss of a newspaper matter as
much as it did in 1970, when the scores of cable channels and
hundreds of Web sites did not exist?
</P>
<P>
   The new media landscape and the growing competition for
advertising dollars, make it harder for a weak newspaper to
survive, and make its survival less urgent, Lacy believes. ``I'm
not sure I'd call the Newspaper Preservation Act a failure,'' he
said. ``Just a non-success. People back then did not realize that
this would not make a difference in the long run.''

DIGITAL COMMERCE: TOO MANY HANGERS-ON CREATES BUMPY RIDE FOR
INTERNET STOCKS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the market for technology stocks continues its lurching
slide, some of us with memories that predate Internet Time are
thinking about infinite loops.
</P>
<P>
   An infinite loop, for those not versed in software lingo, is a
type of computer program that runs the same instructions
continuously until it is either stopped or interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   The infinite loop also seems an appropriate metaphor for the
loaves-and-fishes, endless multiplication of Internet
``businesses'' and the inevitable indigestion; consolidations and
bankruptcies and shakeouts and layoffs have become the expected and
ritual machinations of the technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   The instruction set for this industry's infinite loop _ a kind
of Full Employment Act for everyone from entrepreneurs and
investors to the news media _ goes like this:
</P>
<P>
   Some kid in a dorm room (previous incarnation: some guy in a
garage) invents _ or appropriates or whatever _ some technology or
designs a new gadget or, nowadays, patents some new software-driven
``method of doing business.''
</P>
<P>
   The newly minted ``visionary'' asserts he has found the
equivalent of the Holy Grail _ if not in terms of the actual
technology or concept, at least in terms of his ability to induce
religious ecstasy in investors.
</P>
<P>
   He gets his first round of venture financing. He hires a public
relations firm, which trots him around to the market researchers,
the monthlies (i.e., business and trade magazines) and eventually
to the national business press to peddle the story of this latest
vision.
</P>
<P>
   The pundits go wild. Venture capitalists start financing
imitators' wannabe business plans with abandon. Wall Street bestows
upon them enormous valuations based on ``potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Visionary and wannabes alike take their companies to the public
market. The venture capitalists and founders sell off a pile of
stock as soon as possible. The folks they sell it to lose their
shirts when the stock begins hemorrhaging, as it almost inevitably
does.
</P>
<P>
   The news media started a backlash to the mania, which they were
complicit in creating.
</P>
<P>
   Then the next-generation visionary comes along and starts the
cycle again.
</P>
<P>
   And there you have it. Infinite loopiness. Sound familiar? After
the last couple of weeks of stock shock, it should. What is
happening today is a manifestation of infinite loopiness, plain and
simple.
</P>
<P>
   This particular loop _ oversell, overkill, regroup, do it again
_ has been running since the first visionary had to talk his way
into the hearts and minds of investors who knew a lot more about
money than they knew about technology.
</P>
<P>
   Remember artificial intelligence? Pen computing? Both were the
Next Big Thing _ hot investment targets that became big losers _ in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   How about CD-ROM's? In 1984 (and every year for more than 10
years after), they were destined to save the educational system and
revolutionize entertainment. Ditto for interactive television in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   And now it's E-commerce and the Internet and the Web. Obviously
the commercial Internet has been exponentially more successful than
artificial intelligence or CD-ROM's, but with the exception of a
few remarkable companies, products and services that have actually
changed the world, it has followed the same general course.
</P>
<P>
   And now the stocks are sliding and panic is spreading throughout
the sector.
</P>
<P>
   And whom do we have to thank? The omnipresent carpetbaggers we
know today as the dot-coms. The me-too companies _ and the venture
firms and investment banks who finance them and take them public.
They don't even pretend to be the next Netscape or Yahoo or Amazon,
most of them. They are just slip-streaming.
</P>
<P>
   E-tailing. E-trading. E-dating. E-pets. E-drugs. Streaming
media. Broadband applications, also known as dot-coms on steroids.
Cable modems. Interactive TV redux.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the carpetbaggers stick around long enough to ship a
product (if there even is one). Sometimes they don't.
</P>
<P>
   But in a few months or a year, when the company hasn't turned
profitable on a dime, they either sell it off or fold up their
tents and go home with whatever golden parachutes they have managed
to finagle for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving, of course, a pile of investors on the sidewalk with
empty pockets and bad attitudes about technology stocks. And
because today's investors are still so naive about technology
investing, the crash of the carpetbaggers paints the entire
industry with the broad brush of uncertainty and hucksterism.
</P>
<P>
   This has been true in every infinite loop of the volatile
technology industry. But the broad reach of the Internet, which
puts the industry's health at the itchy trigger finger of anyone
with a computer, a modem and an online trading account, magnifies
the effect of every shaky company and stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   As one prominent venture capitalist, Ann Winblad of Hummer
Winblad Venture Partners, says: ``We have to be so careful about
every single investment we make. One bad move, and all the rest of
them follow us down the rat hole.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all venture capitalists or investment bankers are so
circumspect or behave so responsibly. One prominent technology
executive who prefers to remain anonymous compares the venture pack
to narcotics dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have every incentive to keep shoveling new companies and
new shares out there as fast as the investors will buy them up, and
they have no incentive to try to talk investors down,'' the
executive said. ``I think they're mostly in the mode of raking in
the bucks as fast as possible while the getting is good and
assuming that it won't last forever.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, until the next time.

PATENTS: CALCULATING THE VALUE OF DERIVATIVES; FANS FOR THE FEET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Idaho)  (lb) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board,
estimated earlier this year that the financial derivatives market
was worth some $80 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   But exactly how do you go about calculating the worth of
financial derivatives _ securities whose value is derived from an
underlying asset, like a stock, bond or currency? If Goldman, Sachs
is thinking about buying a basket of 30-year mortgages, for
example, how can it grasp the slippery value of such a complicated
asset?
</P>
<P>
   One way is to use a statistical technique known as Monte Carlo,
which was devised in the late 1940s by hydrogen-bomb designers at
Los Alamos, N.M., who realized they could not solve nuclear-fusion
equations by conventional means. Monte Carlo is a broad idea that
has since been applied in many different ways in many different
fields, from physics to finance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Irwin Vanderhoof, a professor of finance at New York
University, suspected that another technique _ sometimes referred
to as quasi-Monte Carlo _ might give speedier, more accurate
results when the value of financial derivatives and other complex
securities is calculated.
</P>
<P>
   It was a suspicion that was not shared by others. ``Nobody
believed in the early '90s that this could be superior to Monte
Carlo,'' said Joseph Traub, a professor of computer science at
Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderhoof arranged for Goldman, Sachs to give Traub a difficult
problem _ figuring the value of a collateralized mortgage
obligation, which is essentially a collection of 30-year mortgages
whose worth is difficult to fix because of varying interest rates
and unpredictable prepayments.
</P>
<P>
   Spassimir Paskov, then one of Traub's graduate students, valued
the mortgages using both Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   ``To our amazement, we found that quasi-Monte Carlo consistently
beat Monte Carlo by a factor of 10 to 1,000,'' Traub said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Traub, Vanderhoof and Paskov will receive a patent
for their use of this numerical technique for assessing the value
of complex securities like derivatives.
</P>
<P>
   So what is the difference between regular Monte Carlo and
quasi-Monte Carlo? To understand, imagine trying to estimate the
average depth of a pond.
</P>
<P>
   With Monte Carlo, one would take measurements of the pond's
depth at random points. If the points are plotted on an aerial
drawing of the pond, some areas will be pocked with points while
other areas will be bare.
</P>
<P>
   With quasi-Monte Carlo, depth measurements are taken at points
that have been selected deterministically _ that is, with a
formula. If the points are plotted on an aerial picture of the
pond, they will be scattered in an even, patterned fashion, with no
bare spots or clusters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In quasi-Monte Carlo, the points are chosen uniformly with as
few points as possible such that the average of the measured depth
is close to the true average depth,'' Traub said.
</P>
<P>
   Why does quasi-Monte Carlo work faster and more accurately than
the regular Monte Carlo? It could have to do with the fact that
when cash flows are figured, near-term variables carry much more
weight than variables in the distant future. ``Clearly there is
something special about finance problems,'' Traub said.
</P>
<P>
   Paskov, who is now an associate director in risk management for
the investment arm of Barclays Bank, built a software system that
uses the quasi-Monte Carlo to value derivatives and other complex
securities. The software, called Finder, is being licensed by
Columbia University to investment houses and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Traub, Vanderhoof and Paskov will receive patent 5,940,810.
</P>
<P>
   Inventor Puts a Fan Underfoot
</P>
<P>
   Norman Landry, an inventor in Boise, Idaho, is cooling his heels
_ literally. Last month he patented a ``shoe sole with
liquid-powered ventilating fans.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom of Landry's shoe has a tiny turbine sandwiched
between two antifreeze-filled compartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foot movement as the user walks or runs will put pressure on
the liquid and make it flow, typically from back to front, and then
to back again, the movement of which will cause the turbine to
turn,'' Landry's patent states.
</P>
<P>
   The turbine, in turn, powers miniature fans, which force air
through channels either into holes in the bottom of the shoe or
upward onto the wearer's ankles.
</P>
<P>
   Landry received patent 5,918,381.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the World Wide Web at www.uspto.gov or
may be ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the
Patent and Trademark Office, Washington DC 20231.

E-COMMERCE REPORT: CONVENTIONAL RETAILERS USE WEB TO IMPROVE
SERVICE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Traditional retailers have spent the last two years watching the
Internet play havoc with their businesses. To divine the secrets of
the new medium, they have been forced to study their virtual
counterparts for clues on how to compete in this radically
different arena. Many have sought the counsel of Internet
consultants, while others have felt compelled to wade through
stacks of dot-com and E-business books _ bought, no doubt, at
Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Now that some of the faster readers have finished studying, they
seem poised to turn the tables on their Internet brethren.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers of the so-called bricks-and-mortar variety are
plotting their revenge not simply by creating Web sites of their
own, but by integrating their Internet operations into their
physical stores. Executives say that by mingling the virtual and
physical retail environments, they can better serve customers in
both. There is, of course, a newly minted buzz phrase associated
with this trend _ ``clicks and mortar'' _ but those in the industry
say the transformation has been brewing for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been dealing with a lot of companies almost paralyzed
with fear about the Internet,'' said Melissa Bane, an E-commerce
analyst with the Yankee Group, an Internet consulting firm. ``Some
of the smarter ones are starting to realize that it's their game to
lose. They already have the customers, and now they can use the
Internet in their stores as a tool to expand their share of
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Activmedia Inc., an Internet research firm, 54
percent of companies with online and off-line sales operations now
report substantial two-way interaction between the two divisions.
Analysts and executives say most of that interaction focuses on
such things as marketing campaigns, but the strategy is starting to
move beyond simply printing the address of the company's Web site
on its receipts and shopping bags.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Recreational Equipment Inc., an outdoor goods
retailer, has placed Internet kiosks in 52 of its 53 stores and has
integrated Web access into its cash registers, said Matt Hyde, vice
president for online sales. The kiosks allow shoppers to look up
detailed information on every product that Recreational Equipment
carries, regardless of whether that particular item is available in
the store. Blocking software bars users from going to sites other
than the retailer's (www.rei.com) and its outlet site
(www.rei-outlet.com). Meanwhile, cashiers can look up items on line
through the Web-enabled registers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a quantum leap in terms of customer service,'' Hyde
said. ``Say I'm in our Wisconsin store, and I'm looking for a haul
bag for a rock-climbing trip to Yosemite. I'm not going to find
that in that store. Before, I'd stand in line at customer service,
a rep would look it up, and I'd have to know exactly what I wanted
for them to be able to help me because chances are they wouldn't be
familiar with haul bags. Now, I can look that up with or without a
salesperson, I can see pictures with all the product info, and I
can buy it at the checkout counter and have it delivered.''
</P>
<P>
   Anecdotal evidence suggests that Recreational Equipment was the
first major retailer to put kiosks into its stores, starting in
Seattle, in 1996. Such kiosks are quickly becoming standard fare,
however. Companies like Sears, Gap, Compaq Computer and Borders
Books, among others, have begun major efforts to give customers a
virtual shopping option even as they browse the aisles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure that 10 years from now, every major retail company
will have an Internet-enabled device in the store,'' said Rick
Vanzura, president of Borders Online, who began the bookseller's
campaign to install Internet kiosks in each of the company's 270
superstores.
</P>
<P>
   Vanzura, who recently left Borders to join a start-up company,
said the Internet effort would cost Borders ``in the eight
figures,'' given the technology infrastructure it requires. In the
coming months, he said, the store kiosks will allow customers to
order not only any of the 700,000 titles in the Borders warehouses,
but also out-of-print books, which will be printed and shipped to
the customer's home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly an expensive proposition,'' Vanzura said. ``But
I'm confident we'll see a return on that investment _ and it won't
take decades.''
</P>
<P>
   David S. Pottruck, co-chief executive of Charles Schwab, said
the cost of integrating his company's Internet strategy with its
off-line strategy had gone far beyond the price of Internet kiosks.
Pottruck, who said he coined the phrase clicks and mortar in a
recent speech, noted that when the company merged its on- and
off-line divisions last year and lowered the charge for off-line
clients from roughly $65 a trade to $30 (to match the online fee),
it cost the company between $125 million and $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he said, Schwab had to integrate online trading
kiosks more fully into its 300 offices, train its advisers to serve
customers both on line and off and bolster the company's customer
service systems.
</P>
<P>
   But the move has clearly paid off, he said, given the company's
leading position in the online trading category and its customer
growth this year. And more changes will be in order, as customers
become technically savvier, he predicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't need people to provide some of what's needed today,
but it will open the door for people to provide new services that
we don't have today,'' Pottruck said. ``You might click on an icon
on your computer and have someone appear immediately to help you.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the realm of finance, he said, ``traditional stores
will need to use the Internet to create a richer shopping
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Supermarkets will have to provide a range of experiences _
cooking tips, recipes you can get at a kiosk _ instead of simply
being places to pick up merchandise,'' he said. ``Those days are
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bane, of the Yankee Group, said that once companies
integrated the Internet into their point-of-sale systems, cashiers
could conceivably access a customer's previous buying history
during checkout and suggest other items to buy. Or, once shoppers
returned home, they might find a coupon in their e-mail from a
store they recently visited. The store's knowledge of the
customer's on- and off-line purchasing history is potent marketing
material, she said, adding, ``They can leverage the technology
investments they've already made.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gap, for one, has no immediate plans for such a
comprehensive integration of its on- and off-line stores, Rebecca
Weill, a company spokeswoman, said. But the company has created
``Web lounges'' at eight of its flagship stores, featuring black
leather couches, chairs and computers framed with brushed metal
casings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're always crowded,'' Ms. Weill said of the lounges.
``Sometimes people even buy items from the kiosk instead of going
through the store for them.''

<P>
   CANNES, France _ If anybody ought to know how the Hotel
Martinez, the most luxurious palace on the palm-shaded beach
promenade in Cannes, got its name, it is Phillip Kenny.
</P>
<P>
   Emmanuel Martinez, the Italian immigrant and bon vivant who
opened the hotel in 1929, was his grandfather, a hotelier as
renowned in his day as the hotel, which was soon taking in people
like the Duke of Windsor as guests.
</P>
<P>
   But after World War II, Martinez was accused of collaboration
with the Italian and German occupiers of this part of the French
Riviera, and he lost the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was later cleared of consorting with the enemy,
confusion about whether he had sold the hotel to a black marketeer
led the French government to seize it in 1944 and keep it until
1982. Then it was sold to the Taittinger family's Concorde Hotel
Group, which had been managing it, for 55 million francs, about $10
million in today's money.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez never saw a penny of that; he had died in Italy in
1973. But his name still stands, in huge illuminated letters
emblazoned over the seventh floor of his hotel. Now Kenny, a
54-year-old film producer who lives in Barcelona, Spain, is suing
for about half a million dollars' worth of compensation from the
French state for himself and a handful of other surviving Martinez
heirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to clear my grandfather's name,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of dollars' worth of property seized during the war is
still the subject of public debate in France, but mostly it was
property or money taken from French Jews before they were sent to
Nazi camps by French collaborationist authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Martinez story is about the other side of the history of the
occupation, the people accused of collaborating with the Nazis, and
it has almost as many touches of cynicism and irony as
``Casablanca.'' Kenny says he is ready to write the book if
somebody else will make the movie.
</P>
<P>
   But the only collaborator in the story, as Kenny tells it, was
Michel Skolnikoff, a shadowy immigrant from Russia known as the
``emperor of the black market'' in France during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny's own father was a Canadian who worked as an Allied
intelligence agent in Cannes, where he fell in love with a child
Martinez had fathered by one of his employees while he was managing
a hotel in Nice in 1923.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Martinez had this child, Micheline, adopted by his
lifelong mistress, Emma Digard. Kenny's father married Micheline
Digard in Cannes in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   But the war plunged Martinez into financial ruin, and, according
to his grandson, he was forced to turn to the shadowy Skolnikoff
for a large loan, surrendering shares in the hotel as security. In
1944, when the Allies began moving in, Skolnikoff, anxious to get
out of the Riviera ahead of them, insisted on having the loan
repaid and returned the shares _ all but a few, that is, which he
left in a safe deposit box in Monaco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was solely on the basis of the few shares found in the safe
deposit box that the hotel was seized,'' Kenny said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Italian and later German occupation authorities had
been using the 435-room Hotel Martinez as their headquarters, Kenny
said, Martinez was also denounced as a collaborator. Though
Resistance leaders and a few Jews he had helped protect from the
Nazis would later help him clear his name after the war, Martinez
fled to Italy for his own safety.
</P>
<P>
   A Committee for Confiscation of Illicit Profits, declaring that
the Hotel Martinez had apparently been under Skolnikoff's control,
had the hotel seized as security for a large criminal fine of 39
million francs, then worth about $8 million. A tribunal found
Martinez guilty, in absentia, of collaboration with the enemy and
sentenced him to 20 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Skolnikoff fled to Spain and died in 1945 during an attempt by
French agents to kidnap him and bring him back to France for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's reputation was rehabilitated by a court in Lyons that
acquitted him on the collaboration charge in 1949, but he could not
prove the hotel had not belonged to Skolnikoff when it was seized,
and went back to Italy empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Down through the decades, various would-be heirs tried to claim
ownership, without success, and the French administration kept
running the hotel, saying it was applying the income toward
interest on the fine.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, after Martinez died, the state began putting money
into the hotel to fix it up, finally selling it at auction to the
Concorde Group in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Kenny said, he and his lawyers got a court in
Aix-en-Provence to evaluate the hotel's worth at 140 million
francs, the equivalent of $23 million now, twice what the Domains
Service, a branch of the Finance Ministry, had sold it for.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Kenny said, Jacques Foccart, then one of
President Jacques Chirac's advisers, observed that the hotel had
been sold ``under hardly orthodox conditions'' and told the service
he hoped justice could eventually be done.
</P>
<P>
   Next year Kenny's mother, a nephew of Martinez and Martinez's
former company in Cannes expect a ruling from an appeals court in
Paris on their claims for $500,000 in damages for the failure of
the Domains Service to obey an earlier court order to provide
accounts for the 37 years it owned the hotel. In the next few
months, Kenny said, they also plan to bring a separate suit to get
the original seizure invalidated.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Cannes still whisper about how Martinez lost his
hotel because he collaborated during the war,'' Kenny said. ``Even
though he was rehabilitated, he still never got his honor back. You
never really win with the French bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Concorde Hotels proudly tells visitors that Martinez, ``after
running several establishments in London, Monte Carlo and Paris,
decided to build a Cannes palace'' in the 1920s, and Concorde keeps
his name in lights over the hotel. But a spokesman, Hubert David,
said the controversy was ``a delicate matter'' about which he could
not comment.

BARAK DIFFUSES, FOR NOW, CONTROVERSY OVER SABBATH TRANSPORT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Sunday defused
a crisis with a key Orthodox party that had threatened to leave his
governing coalition because a huge turbine part was transported on
the Sabbath, in contravention of religious law.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, negotiators for Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat held another meeting, this time in the Gaza Strip.
And there were growing signs that the two sides were slowing
bridging their gap on their latest land-for-security accord. Talks
are expected to last another week or so before an Arafat-Barak
meeting can conclude the arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   On the religious crisis, Barak told the four ministers in his
government from the Shas Party that he would set up a committee to
study alternatives to Sabbath transport. The ministers said that
satisfied them for now, although if no alternative is found, they
will ask their party's Council of Sages to study the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Five more such turbine parts have yet to make the trip, and the
next one is scheduled to be carried out in a month.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-hour, 50-mile transport of the 250-ton turbine part took
place from Friday night to Saturday morning despite protests from
Shas ministers and other religious leaders. Barak said such
transport of major parts had long taken place over the Sabbath,
when fewer people are on the roads than on a weekday, because at
any other time, the roads would be tied up in major traffic jams
that could threaten public safety.
</P>
<P>
   Shas controls 17 seats in Barak's 75-member governing coalition,
guaranteeing him a majority in the 120-seat parliament. If Shas had
used this as an occasion to leave the government, as its leaders
had threatened, Barak would have been left without a majority.
</P>
<P>
   Political experts pointed out that Barak would probably have
persuaded other parties not now in his government to join, thus
regaining his governing majority. That appeared to be one reason
Shas chose not to carry out its threat now.
</P>
<P>
   Secular Israelis cheered the turbine part as it made its way
down from outside Tel Aviv to an electrical plant in the coastal
city of Ashkelon. The flatbed truck took up the entire road and was
accompanied by scores of policemen.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers devoted pages of triumphant coverage to the move
Sunday and presented it as a victory of ordinary Israelis over a
powerful group that often holds the rest of the country in its
political grip.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a victory of common sense,'' said Nahum Barnea, a
news commentator in the mass-selling newspaper Yediot Ahronot.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, the first government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
fell when religious coalition partners walked out after officials
permitted F-15 jet fighters to be delivered to the country after
the start of the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   On the talks with the Palestinians over the Wye River memorandum
signed in October, aides to Barak said they were encouraged that
common ground was being found between the two sides. The
Palestinians have been insisting that the original timetable for
withdrawals be respected, while Barak has asked the Palestinians to
accept a delay in the last withdrawal in exchange for other
concessions.
</P>
<P>
   One unidentified Palestinian leader was quoted by the Reuters
news service Sunday as saying the Palestinians may accept a slight
delay ``if it comes within a package deal that insures
implementation of the Wye agreements.''

CHERYL MILLS LOOKS FORWARD TO LIFE AFTER IMPEACHMENT

 By ROBIN TONER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Cheryl Mills acknowledges that it was hard to turn
down the White House counsel's job, and not simply because she is a
34-year-old African-American woman whose appointment would be a
first for both race and gender.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a matter of loyalty. She joined the Clinton
transition team in 1992, moved to the White House in 1993 as
associate counsel to the president and hung on through seven stormy
years, capped by her powerful defense of the president in his
Senate impeachment trial this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very hard,'' she says a few days after her decision was
announced and the administration renewed their search for a
replacement for the departed Charles F.C. Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   What did the president say when she told him she would not
accept the job? She sighs, heavily. ``I can't,'' she says, shaking
her head. ``But it made me sad.''
</P>
<P>
   It is time to move on, Ms. Mills says. Time to give someone
else, she adds with a hard little smile, ``the joy that I've had
for so many years.''
</P>
<P>
   There is the air of the returning veteran about the young
lawyer, of someone battle-hardened and proud of it. The screen
saver on her computer reads, ``It's the lioness that hunts ...'' A
small sign above her desk declares, ``Don't Go There.'' The walls
are dominated by huge posters of Michael Jordan, at his most
formidable.
</P>
<P>
   Has she put the impeachment battle behind her? If she ended up
at a dinner party with Rep. Henry Hyde, the conservative Illinois
Republican who managed the case against the president, could she
make small talk?
</P>
<P>
   She grimaces and looks up at the ceiling, all the careful
lawyer-speak eluding her for a moment. Then it clicks in. ``I think
that the House managers were obviously committed to their vision
and view of the president's conduct,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that what I've always tried to do is be committed to
not just thoughts about conduct but more the Constitution and what
it would provide, and what our framers would hope we would do in a
moment like this,'' she explains, ``as well as trying to help
people appreciate how difficult the situation was and the choices
people make on a very human level.''
</P>
<P>
   She starts to laugh, and adds, ``And I think that at a dinner
party, assuming we weren't talking about the impeachment, we'd all
be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many departures at the Clinton White House these days,
so many that The Washington Post recently ranked the food at the
going-away parties; the presence of shrimp on the menu was
considered the surest indicator of status. It is probably safe to
say that Cheryl Mills will get shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   She is a classic overachiever, who says she knew by fifth-grade
that she wanted to be a lawyer. ``I know, very bizarre,'' she says.
One of two children in a military family _ her father was a
lieutenant colonel in the Army who retired after 27 years _ Ms.
Mills grew up in Germany, Belgium and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have incredibly positive associations with the military,''
she says. Military communities abroad were ``almost like a little
bit of an experimental environment, in which people really related
well to each other without regard to race, but related to each
other based on nationality,'' she adds. ``In that sense, I grew up
thinking of the world as being, or at least having the capacity to
be, incredibly fair and balanced if given the right environment and
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   She graduated from the University of Virginia, where she made
Phi Beta Kappa, and from Stanford Law School, where she was elected
to the Law Review. After a brief stint at Hogan &AMP; Hartson, a
Washington law firm, she joined the Clinton transition team and
moved to Little Rock, Ark., where she lived in the same apartment
complex as the president's secretary, Betty Currie, and Carol
Browner, now commissioner of the Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   For seven years Ms. Mills was at the epicenter of the Clinton
scandals and acquired a reputation as extremely tough, extremely
loyal and a leading figure in the give-no-ground camp in the White
House. A fair appraisal? ``I think tough is fair,'' she says. As
for giving no ground, she adds, she merely wanted to make sure that
what information was released was accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Lanny Davis, who was brought in to help deal with the scandals,
later wrote about the tension between the ``press-political''
operation that he was a part of and the legal side of the White
House. ``In the early days she and I often clashed, sometimes
strenuously, usually over the same issue,'' he wrote of Ms. Mills
in ``Truth to Tell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would want to push out information when the press wanted
it,'' Davis wrote, ``and she would insist on accuracy and
completeness, with what I sometimes felt was an excessive concern
for legal risks.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Davis spoke fondly of his old sparring partner,
saying that as much as they argued, Ms. Mills was the one who
called and checked up on him when he was hospitalized with a bad
stomach.
</P>
<P>
   For all her years in the White House, Ms. Mills' big public
moment came only in January, when she delivered her impassioned
defense of the president, not only against charges of obstruction
of justice, but also against the notion that his conduct betrayed a
profound insensitivity to civil rights for blacks and women. She
dismissed that notion with great disdain. ``I'm not worried about
civil rights, because this president's record on civil rights, on
women's rights, on all of our rights is unimpeachable,'' she
declared.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mills says she got hundreds of letters afterward, and even
before the speech got a lot of support inside the White House,
particularly from blacks. ``The day before I went, everyone, but in
particular African-Americans, came by and said, `We know you're
going to do a good job; we know you're going to do us proud.'''
</P>
<P>
   Her parents were in the Senate gallery that day, and by the end
they were crying. ``In my family, that's a rare occurrence,'' Ms.
Mills says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mills, who was named deputy counsel in 1997, will be the
acting White House counsel until a permanent one is found. She is
vague about her plans, saying only that she is considering ``a
number of different things in the private sector'' and is not
confining herself to law.
</P>
<P>
   The standard explanation for burned-out 30-somethings leaving
high-level jobs in Washington is the desire to ``have a life,'' but
Ms. Mills dislikes that characterization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually think, as unusual as it might sound,'' she says,
``that working in the White House is an extraordinary life.''

<P>
   UNIONVILLE, Mo. _ With hog manure fouling streams in the rolling
countryside of northern Missouri, the giant pork producer Premium
Standard Farms agreed early this month to pay $25 million to settle
a suit accusing it of violating the state's Clean Water Act.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with the hog company, which processes 2 million
pigs a year in six Missouri counties, is the largest environmental
settlement with any hog-producing operation in the United States
and illustrates the tightening restrictions facing the big
producers.
</P>
<P>
   With pigs now being raised in virtual factories, the settlement
by Premium Standard Farms of the suit brought by Missouri Attorney
General Jay Nixon comes as states are starting to monitor livestock
production as they would a smokestack industry.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Kansas, the State Health Department announced
this month that it was requiring farms with more than 10,000
animals to line their waste pits with plastic, a measure designed
to keep manure out of groundwater and prevent it from contaminating
drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Several states have declared moratoriums on expansion of giant
hog farms. Dozens of counties around the nation have passed
measures designed to limit or exclude big hog farms. Nebraska has
kept the hog factories out by banning all corporate farming.
</P>
<P>
   There are few issues as contentious in the American countryside
as the corporate hog industry, in which the manure of thousands of
pigs is concentrated in lagoons and then sprayed over fields. The
process can create a terrible odor for miles around. And when
spills occur, the manure seeps into streams and kills fish. Premium
Standard was accused of several spills, including one near here,
that killed fish and threatened groundwater.
</P>
<P>
   While most attention on big hog operations has focused on the
offensive odor, water pollution caused by the manure poses the
biggest threat, environmentalists say. The Sierra Club has labeled
big hog operations as one of the most serious threats to the
nation's environment. The giant hog farms have degraded some 35,000
miles of rivers and streams in 22 states, said Ed Hopkins, a
spokesman for the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hog operations are still classified as agricultural,'' Hopkins
said, ``but they have turned into industrial sites.''
</P>
<P>
   When Premium Standard Farms sprayed animal waste on fields, it
was technically doing the same thing farmers have always done, but
in much larger amounts. In small amounts, in the style of family
farmers, the manure served as fertilizer for crops. The
concentrated manure from the hog factories, on the other hand, is
much too strong for crop fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement with the state, Premium Standard Farms must
treat the waste before it is spread on the land, to guard against
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Many politicians in Missouri and other states have labeled the
big hog producers, like Premium Standard, as threats to the
environment as well as the rural economy. The big hog producers,
meanwhile, say environmental rules are being used as a weapon to
keep out an emerging industry that does not fit with the rural
tradition of the family farm.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Drabenstott, a vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank
in Kansas City and an expert on the rural economy, said the hog
industry had largely chosen to expand in the West, including the
Oklahoma Panhandle and Utah, which is new territory for growing
hogs. As scrutiny of hog operations intensified, Drabenstott said,
the differences in regulations between states became smaller.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is going to go where it feels welcome,''
Drabenstott said. ``These days, the discussion is not so much
whether we go to Iowa or Missouri _ it's do we stay in the United
States or do we go to Mexico?''
</P>
<P>
   Big hog producers have started raising some pigs in the western
provinces of Canada and are said to be considering doing the same
in Mexico, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tougher regulations come at a time when hog prices have ranged
from poor to catastrophic. The low prices have driven many smaller
farmers out of business and have hurt the big producers, too.
Prices for hogs at meat processors, now about 36 cents a pound,
have rebounded considerably from a low of less than 10 cents a
pound last December.
</P>
<P>
   The rising prices have been fueled, in large part, by
expectations that the economy is improving in Asia, a major
importer of American pork. But even at 35 or 40 cents a pound, most
farmers are barely breaking even, Drabenstott said.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Arnott, a spokesman for Premium Standard Farms, said the
state had been justified in ``holding us accountable'' on water
pollution. But Arnott said the debate over large-scale hog
production in the American countryside was often driven by emotion
and nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott said that the increases in technology, along with the
global nature of markets, had forever changed the face of
agriculture. But he said the big-scale hog producers were helping
people survive in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``What everybody is interested in is a quality rural way of
life,'' he said. ``It isn't the same as the old style of
agriculture. But there are a whole lot of people in Northern
Missouri who now are able to live in the country, send their kids
to a rural school and enjoy the neighborly quality of life,''
because of the 2,400 jobs created by the hog producer.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Siemer, a 27-year-old barber, had left his depressed
hometown of nearby Princeton nearly a decade ago, but as economic
conditions improved vastly in the region, he was able to return
home and go into business. His father, who had gone broke in
farming, now drives a truck for Premium Standard Farms.
</P>
<P>
   To the younger Siemer, who goes by the name Ace, a little odor
of hog manure is worth the benefit of jobs. He said the water
pollution was being exaggerated for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a ghost town not long ago,'' Siemer said. ``Now I
look out my door and I see a restaurant, an insurance agency, a gas
station.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the view of Terry Spence, a 52-year-old cattle farmer and
a sharp critic of the big hog factory, the countryside is being
sold down the river. He said the state did not win nearly a large
enough settlement from Premium Standard Farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have grandchildren, and I don't like them to be outside when
this odor gets so bad,'' Spence said. ``This is not the typical
farm smell. Animals have always roamed the land. But when you
compound it like that, it's terrible. It isn't farming. Call it
something else.''

and spiritual hunger of contemporary Westerners, too. It is ironic,
then, that the Dalai Lama comes to Indiana this week, not so much
as an ambassador for Buddhism, but to deliver a message that is
most startling to hear from a religious leader: That is, religion
doesn't matter. (Dayton Daily News). 31. WITH PHOTOS. MOVED.

   IOWA-POLLL (Ames, Iowa) _ Flush with a victory in the Republican
straw poll here, Texas Gov. George W. Bush looked ahead Sunday to
next year's primary season and the race for his party's
presidential nomination. But the non-binding poll designed to raise
funds for the state Republican Party in Iowa may have proved fatal
for at least one candidate. Lamar Alexander called his sixth-place
finish ``a disappointment'' and said he would decide within the
next few days whether to continue his second run for the White
House. By GARY MARTIN.

`THEY'VE GOT DEATH BOUND UP': WITHOUT DEATH, THE NEIGHBORHOOD
DIES 
</HEADLINE>
 (Production notes at end of review) 
(ms) 
 By D.J.R. BRUCKNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Temptations from heaven are as perilous as those from
hell, a clever peasant discovers in ``Tiene la Muerte Atada''
(``They've Got Death Bound Up''). This is the wittiest, most
lyrical and colorful free summer show the Puerto Rican Traveling
Theater and Pregones Theater have ever presented in their annual
series. This year it is running in parks in all five boroughs of
the city and at several New Jersey sites, through Aug. 29.
</P>
<P>
   This operatic comedy has a distinctly Uruguayan spirit. The
playwright, Hugo Bardallo, spices a medieval folk tale with
dialogue so funny and subtle that he packs into one hour more humor
and irony than would seem possible. He is an honored master of
murga, a Mardi Gras theatrical genre involving commedia dell'arte,
song, dance, music based on Latin American and African rhythms
thrummed out on drums and cymbals, and high-pitched choruses that
seem to be sung, with hilarious effect, directly through the nose.
</P>
<P>
   For this production the composer Pablo Zinger has written
melodies based on these traditions as well as on the waltz, tango
and samba, including a few solos that have to compete with waves of
laughter they extort from the audience. And the director, Nelson
Landrieu, a well-known New York actor who, like Bardallo and
Zinger, is a native of Uruguay, whips all this into a choreographed
musical storm that one wants more of _ even if it ends, as it did
the night I saw it, with a roll of thunder from above echoing the
last drum beats. (I would sit through a shower for more of this any
evening.)
</P>
<P>
   In the story, Christ and St. Peter (Francisco Martinez and Bill
Blechingberg) visit the peasant Gonzalez (Pietro Gonzalez), the
most honest man alive, and offer to grant three wishes. He is
cunning enough to ask that he can cancel out anyone else's actions
whenever he wants, that he will get a warning when death is coming
and that he will always win at gambling.
</P>
<P>
   When a luridly seductive Death (Alicia Kaplan) does approach,
bearing her official God-approved snuffer's license, he tricks her
into a crap game. She loses, and he ties her up. Nature is
instantly upended. With no one dying and Gonzalez able to prevent
every mischief, civil order and the economy collapse and the whole
countryside is up in arms against him, beginning with his greedy
sister (Ana Campos). Neighbors summon the cigar-puffing local witch
(Gladys Perez), who appears to have inconvenient extra feet, to hex
him, but she concludes he's possessed by the devil against whom she
is helpless.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Gonzalez proves obstinately impervious to seduction by
a rural Lolita. In a fine bit of slapstick with a useless nose, a
would-be suicide draws a crowd of would-be helpers, all impotent
while Death is bound. A wimpy choir of whiny angels ducks and
cowers, scandalized by the breezy way Christ talks to the Creator
He calls ``Papa.'' Finally, Satan (Juan Villarreal) dances in and,
having failed to free Death on his own, joins St. Peter in a
wonderfully ridiculous duet that persuades Gonzalez to untie the
great equalizer and promise God to live out his earthly life by
earthly rules and to keep his nose out of the Divine dispensation.
</P>
<P>
   Three musicians (Norby Di Bella, Fernando Freire and Wilson
Melgares) are part of the action more often than part of the
background. The seven actors each take several roles, changing
masks and costumes so swiftly onstage that you often wonder where
some of the characters came from. Everyone can dance, beautifully
or clumsily as called for, and everyone sings well (or, in the case
of Gonzalez, rasps as clear as a cracked bell). The fun is
infectious, and the performance is a tickling sendup of the
tradition of Latin American theater, which has an innate tendency
toward the grandeur of opera. If you don't understand Spanish, sit
next to someone who does; the action is always transparent, but you
will miss half the merriment if you do not catch at least some of
the sharp lines and lyrics.

   Privada Inc. of San Jose, Calif., is betting that when typical
consumers become aware of how exposed they are to invasions of
privacy on the Internet, they will part with $5 a month for a cloak
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on a user's computer setup and Internet service
provider, a single visit to a Web site, for instance, can often
reveal the Internet address assigned to the visitor's computer, the
visitor's e-mail address, the browser and operating system being
used, and what plug-ins or Active-X controls have been installed.
It can give away even more information if the user has not removed
the unique serial numbers embedded in Microsoft's Windows 98
operating system and Intel's Pentium III microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder that a recent Harris poll for Business Week found
that fears of losing privacy were the top reason people decided not
to go online and that among those who do, only three out of 10 give
valid information when asked to register at a site.
</P>
<P>
   Privada plans to unveil a new service Monday, called Web
Incognito, that lets users make all of their Internet activities _
e-mail, online chats, Web browsing and even purchases _ completely
anonymous. The service works by encrypting the data flowing out of
a subscriber's computer and redirecting it to the Privada service
after it leaves the Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   Web Incognito masks the data's origins and sends it on to its
intended destination. Responses, like those from Web sites or
e-mail recipients, flow back to Privada, which passes them back to
the subscriber. The service, which can be switched on and off, also
stores the subscriber's ``cookies,'' files that identify the user
to Web sites, so it does not interfere with standard Web surfing.
</P>
<P>
   Web Incognito differs from other anonymity software in two
important ways. It covers all Internet activity, not just Web
browsing or e-mail, for instance. And the identity it protects can
be shared with police officers who have appropriate warrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our service is for protecting the privacy of consumers, not
for hiding criminals or criminal activities,'' said Barbara
Bellissimo, Privada's chief executive. While she said the company
expected to take some heat from privacy rights groups, she added,
``We felt it would be irresponsible not to give law enforcement
agencies the information if they have valid warrants.''
</P>
<P>
   The free software and information about the subscription service
are available at http://www.privada.net/.

   Speaking Up Early on Copyright Infringement
</P>
<P>
   It sounded like saber rattling when a consortium of television
networks and programming companies decided last week to issue a
public threat against the makers of personal video recorders _
devices that some believe will revolutionize the way people watch
television. But the reaction was neither fear nor anger _ and
certainly not one of quaking in corporate boots.
</P>
<P>
   A little nod and a smile were more like it.
</P>
<P>
   That was because the consortium making the threats is made up
mostly of companies already in business with one of the two
entities being threatened.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is copyright infringement, and the consortium wants
mainly to establish that any new company getting into the business
of marketing the recorders, known as PVRs, must agree to enter into
licensing agreements with program suppliers before it re-uses the
material for its own purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies, ReplayTV and Tivo Inc., are already marketing
PVRs, digital devices that make it much easier for home viewers to
create their own programming lineups and potentially to eliminate
commercials. Both companies have actively courted deals with the
big program suppliers. Tivo has already sold minority interests to
four of the companies involved in the consortium: Walt Disney, CBS,
News Corp. and Discovery Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Bert Carp, a Washington-based lawyer who represents the
consortium, the Advanced Television Copyright Coalition, and Turner
Broadcasting, whose parent, Time Warner, is in the consortium, said
the purpose of last week's action, reported first in The Wall
Street Journal, was not to file suit against the two PVR companies,
though such a threat was specified in its press release.
</P>
<P>
   What the consortium is doing, he said, is putting on the record
its expectation that PVR companies must adhere to existing
copyright laws. The consortium is concerned about what happened to
Hollywood studios in the 1970s when they sought to stop Sony Corp.
from selling videocassette recorders.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 against the studios, in part because
the studios were late in asserting their rights, waiting until long
after the machines were in wide use.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wait until you're actually hurt,'' Carp said, ``you
might be making a big mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that other companies are expected to enter the PVR
market, and that some of them might not be as ready to become the
partners of the program suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to choke off the technology,'' Carp said.
``We've just learned that in some cases you need to speak up early
to protect your position.''

   Digital Clock Could Disrupt Global Positioning Devices
</P>
<P>
   For unwary users of the global positioning system _ the
government satellite system that guides ships and airplanes, keeps
cellular networks humming and helps surveyors lay out property
lines _ next weekend could be marred by a disorienting flashback.
</P>
<P>
   The system's effectiveness depends in part on a calendar that
boils the passage of time down to the weeks since Jan. 6, 1980,
plus seconds. Sticking to such basics allows the satellites to
communicate quickly, but the system will run out of digital space
for such timekeeping on Saturday. Some confused receivers will stop
working, and others could generate bad data or display 1980 dates.

operations into their stores. Executives say that by mingling the
virtual and physical environments, they can better serve customers
in both.

HUGE FRENCH BANK MERGER AT AN IMPASSE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ After a grueling five-month takeover battle
among three of France's biggest banks, the results of shareholder
votes released on Saturday suggested that all parties had lost and
that efforts to build up a new French national champion in the form
of the world's largest bank had reached a stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   French regulators said that the would-be acquirer, Banque
Nationale de Paris, had persuaded a solid majority of the
shareholders at one of its takeover targets, Paribas, to sell it
their shares in a cash-and-stock offer worth about $20 billion. But
it fell well short in the second part of the plan, winning only
31.5 percent of the votes for its $19-billion bid to acquire the
other target, Societe Generale.
</P>
<P>
   That constitutes a setback for all three. First, it blocks
Banque Nationale de Paris from creating the world's largest bank,
and it deprives it of the prize it wanted most _ Societe Generale.
</P>
<P>
   But the votes seem to have represented an even greater defeat
for executives at Paribas and Societe Generale, who first announced
a friendly, two-way merger _ a deal that would have excluded Banque
Nationale de Paris. That plan is almost certainly dead.
</P>
<P>
   French regulators must now decide whether to let Banque
Nationale de Paris in fact acquire the minority stake in Societe
Generale. If their answer is yes, Banque Nationale would be the
biggest shareholder in its rival and could press it into a
three-way deal after all.
</P>
<P>
   But most analysts regard this outcome as unlikely and think that
both plans have been stalemated.
</P>
<P>
   Over the longer term, the protracted struggle is likely to leave
permanent changes in French and even European banking. Never before
had France experienced a hostile takeover on a scale of the one
tried by Banque Nationale de Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The battle also fueled anxieties of France's bankers and
political leaders about losing ground to foreign financial
institutions. That has been a particular concern of Finance
Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the fight is not over yet. If French regulators, led
by the president of the Bank of France, decide this week to let
Banque Nationale de Paris take the 31 percent minority stake in
Societe Generale, Banque Nationale would have an effective veto
over major decisions at Societe Generale and enormous leverage to
continue merger negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement, Banque Nationale de Paris greeted the
outcome of the votes with ``very great satisfaction'' and argued
that it had won ``effective control'' of Societe Generale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing that no other shareholder has, either alone or in
conjunction with someone else, 10 percent of the capital, such a
stake gives effective control of Societe Generale,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   But most analysts predicted Sunday that the regulators would not
agree, in part because they did not like the idea of a controlling
minority and because Banque Nationale de Paris had received far
less than majority support from shareholders. ``My sense is that
the percentage is low enough that they will turn it down,'' said
John Leonard of Salomon Smith Barney in London.
</P>
<P>
   Societe Generale executives have argued that ``effective
control'' requires a majority of shareholder votes and are expected
to insist that French regulators force Banque Nationale de Paris to
withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   The shareholder vote came in an extraordinary battle that is
expected to have reverberations in France for years to come. The
struggle highlighted the growing anxieties among the French bankers
and political leaders about their ability to keep pace with foreign
competition, particularly from the likes of Deutsche Bank of
Germany and UBS AG in Switzerland, which are growing through
mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   It began on Feb. 1, when Societe Generale announced an agreement
to take over Paribas in a stock deal worth about $16 billion at the
time. Though executives at all three big banking companies had
periodically discussed mergers over the previous year, the deal
surprised both French financiers and government leaders.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Banque Nationale de Paris fired back with a
hostile-takeover offer totaling $37 billion for both banks. Societe
Generale and Paribas quickly denounced the bids, and the fight was
on.
</P>
<P>
   The battle pitted members of France's business elite against
each other. The French insurance conglomerate AXA, headed by Claude
Bebear, owned stakes in both Banque Nationale de Paris and Paribas.
When Paribas and Societe Generale announced their original plan for
a merger in February, Bebear said the deal made little sense, and
he threw his support to Banque Nationale when it made its bid in
March.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the argument, Societe Generale marshaled
support from a core group of institutional shareholders, including
AGF, the French insurer owned by Allianz AG of Germany, and CGU PLC
of Britain, an insurance carrier. Late in July, CGU raised its
stake in Societe Generale to 6.9 percent from 3.1 percent and said
it hoped the move would block Banque Nationale's bid.
</P>
<P>
   French politicians strongly favored a merger of some kind and
tried to hammer out a compromise. Jean-Claude Trichet, the
president of France's central bank, pressed the three institutions
into face-to-face negotiations late in June. But after a week, the
talks collapsed and each side continued to promote its own plan.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the divergent outcome of the two shareholder votes
could end up being the worst of all worlds. Paribas is
overwhelmingly an investment bank with businesses in specialized
areas like mortgage financing. It has little in the way of a retail
banking network.
</P>
<P>
   Banque Nationale de Paris has a large retail network, which it
would like to pare down because France has far more competing bank
branches than it needs at the moment. Acquiring Societe Generale
would make it easier to consolidate branches, but acquiring Paribas
would do nothing on that front.

 &HT;    GOP contenders hope Forbes' liberal spending hurts Bush
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINTERSET, Iowa - The single most important money man in the
battle for the Republican presidential nomination is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Because Malcolm S. Forbes left a large fortune _ as much as $1
billion _ when he died in 1990, son Steve can spend a small fortune
on his re-run for the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The money makes Forbes the only contender with the financial
ammunition to do something about Gov. George W. Bush's big, early
lead in the polls. It is a fact of fiscal life driving decisions
being made by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   It also means the other candidates who survived Saturday's Iowa
straw poll win by Bush are, in effect, running on the money left by
Forbes' dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime Godzilla and King Kong get into a fight, it's always
interesting for bystanders to watch,'' said Ari Fleischer,
spokesman for Elizabeth Dole, who ran third behind Bush and Forbes
in the non-binding straw poll. ``Sometimes they knock each other
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole and other GOP contenders are counting on conservative
Forbes' liberal spending to reel Bush in. It's an effort Forbes is
well down the path on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is what is the big difference between me and a
certain governor from Texas,'' Forbes said, repeating a query from
a man who listened to him speak in Winterset. ``It's a good
question.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, in his low-key staccato, Forbes moved in for the kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the great mysteries,'' he said, referring to
Bush's positions on major issues. ``Maybe they should do something
on `Discovery.' Where are his positions? You see those puzzles,
`Where's Waldo?' where you try to find Waldo. Maybe you can try
where is his tax plan. Where is the Social Security plan? See if
you can find it. Maybe you have a whole new industry. There's my
entrepreneurial mind going again.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a joke, of sorts. You can tell Forbes is poking fun when
the crooked smile crawls across his generally emotion-free face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put out real principles and policies and I think the
American people are going to demand that,'' he said. ``And those
who don't do it will be able to continue the pursuits they have in
other areas of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a campaign-trail mantra Forbes toted through Iowa last week
in his high-tech bus. And, thanks to the inherited money, Bush is
going to be hearing it for many, many months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, we think it will emerge as a Bush-Forbes race,''
said Forbes adviser Greg Mueller. ``The earlier the better for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes fortune already has dictated decisions for Bush, who
decided early on it was important to raise enough money to be able
to skip federal matching dollars and the spending limits they
bring. Forbes avoided the limits in 1996 by spending $37.5 million
of his own money for a late-starting campaign that had its moments
but eventually lost to Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has succeeded in avoiding the spending limits by collecting
more than $36 million in donations and eschewing the federal money.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Forbes raised $9.5 million, about $6.6 million
of it from his own pocket. He also spent $8.3 million, leaving him
with $1.2 million on hand, compared to Bush's $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the Forbes cash-on-hand figure is misleading. His cash on
hand is limited only by his sizeable personal wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you,'' said Forbes campaign manager Bill Dal Col,
``we will help the governor spend every penny he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes redefined
</P>
<P>
   Like a debutante eager for a second chance at debuting, Forbes
is spending time and money this year to re-tool a first impression.
In 1996 he mounted a television air war based on his flat-tax idea.
Those elements are high priority again this year. But Forbes also
is working to persuade social conservatives he is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   A promise to push for a constitutional amendment banning
abortion is part of the Forbes stump speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize many Americans do not yet share that goal,'' he
said in Winterset. ``But you do not abandon that goal, put it on
the shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a soft dig at Bush, one offered in firmer terms in a radio
ad in which Forbes promises to appoint federal judges who oppose
abortion rights, a promise Bush has declined to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the politicians who are running for president won't
even tell you what kind of judges they will appoint,'' he says on
the ad.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Forbes' family fortune, Bush can count on enduring
more of these kinds of ads. Dole got to listen to them in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't run negative ads,'' Dal Col said. ``We run
comparative ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush remembers those ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1996 (Forbes) spent a lot of his own personal money to try
to tear down other candidates,'' Bush said. ``I think there is
going to be a huge backlash in the year 2000 if that were to
happen. But we'll be ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The counter-attack could come along the lines offered by
Michigan Gov. John Engler, a top Bush campaign lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what Steve Forbes would do. He has no record. He
is a complete cipher when it comes to what he would do,'' said
Engler.
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes is ready with a high-dollar campaign to show that it
is clear what Bush will do, and it will not be in the best
interests of the masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Washington lobbyists, all the special interests are
rallying around him,'' said Forbes. ``He is clearly the
establishment candidate. That's why the party leadership has
rallied around him and the party money has rallied around him. It
is a contest ultimately between the status quo establishment, where
at most you just make little trimmings around the edges, versus
real, substantive change from an independent outside not beholden
to the lobbyists and special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   On the road
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' effort at repositioning is finding some success. At a
Des Moines, speech, Pam Glazebrook sat down front with 13-year-son
Willie, a home-schooled child sporting an ``Abortion is Mean''
T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Glazebrook liked Forbes in 1996, but was not convinced then that
he was as fervently against abortion rights as she is. She is now a
true believer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in gray areas,'' she said of Bush's refusal to
promise to appoint judges and a running mate who share his
anti-abortion rights stance. ``The fact is that (Bush) won't get
behind us with actions. He is willing to support it but he is not
willing to stand up for it.''
</P>
<P>
   A few tables back, pharmacist Dave Shafman wore his political
feelings on his shirt: ``Christian, American, Heterosexual,
Pro-gun, Conservative. Any questions?''
</P>
<P>
   Shafman is on board with Forbes and down on Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not campaigning,'' he said of the Texas governor. ``He
is just collecting money and not saying anything. If he ends up
being the nominee I will support him, but he is not my first choice
by any stretch of the imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   On the stump, Forbes offers a monotone that sounds like it could
be leading to a homework assignment. Though not devoid of a catchy
line or two (he pitches his call for an end to estate taxes by
proposing ``no taxation without respiration''), Forbes is not
central casting's choice for a late-20th century American political
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I didn't break the screen,'' he told a Des Moines woman
who said she had seen him on TV.
</P>
<P>
   But he is patching together a following that crosses social
class. At his speeches, he's a millionaire preaching a
working-class message. On board his campaign buses, wealthy
businessmen pass the time between stops by comparing notes on their
multi-million-dollar enterprises and private airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm driven by his message,'' said Herman Cain of Omaha,
chairman of Godfather's Pizza. ``And I'm driven by his dedication
and commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Cain met with Bush at the governor's Austin
office. Cain came away more convinced than ever that Forbes is his
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met with him just to get acquainted with him and find out
some of his views on some of the issues Steve is talking about,''
said Cain. ``Let's say that I like Steve Forbes much better.''

COMMENTARY: A `LUCKY COUNTRY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ Of all societies, South Africa cannot be
separated from its past. Not long ago it was a country where people
were tortured and murdered because of their politics. A country
where, because of their race, husbands were systematically
separated from their wives. A country where a small minority,
defined by race, held all economic and political power.
</P>
<P>
   Given that history, it is something of a miracle that South
Africa today is a normal country with social and economic problems.
The problems are large, but they can be debated in freedom. Tyranny
is only a memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a very lucky country,'' Kaizer Nyatsumba, editor of The
Daily News in Durban, wrote in a column the other day. ``We have a
functional and fully stable democracy. ... We have a free press,
opposition parties are free to speak their minds on just about
everything, and we have many outspoken organs of civil society.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked Nyatsumba what had led him to write that column. ``You
hear people express concerns about the country,'' he said. ``It's
forgotten that things could have been much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course it is quite natural for people to think about current
conditions rather than the horrors of the past. They have to live
in the present. And they have to deal with some hard realities.
</P>
<P>
   Education is one of the gravest challenges. The apartheid
government relentlessly denied black children decent schooling. The
legacy of that is too many young people unequipped to deal with the
demands of a modern economy. A new minister of education, Kader
Asmal, has impressed people with his commitment to raise standards.
``He's the best thing to happen to our education in 350 years,'' a
black professional said to me.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment stands at about 30 percent. The hope of lowering
that socially devastating figure rests on economic growth. The
economy has been hit by the falling gold price and repercussions
from the Asian crisis, but inflation has been checked and business
seems reasonably confident.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is a menacing phenomenon. South Africa has the
fastest-growing epidemic in the world, with 1,500 new cases a day.
</P>
<P>
   Crime is a universal concern. One grim story shows the depth of
feeling about it. In Alexandra, a poor black area of Johannesburg,
a man was arrested and charged with multiple rapes. A magistrate
set bail at the equivalent of $1,000. Alexandra residents
contributed about $4 each, a large sum for them, so he could be
bailed _ and murdered. It happened.
</P>
<P>
   But if the problems are profound, so have been South Africa's
achievements in the last 10 years. It has just had its second
democratic, nonracial election _ in peace and with no charges of
corruption in the process. How many countries could make that claim
after so revolutionary a political change?
</P>
<P>
   In the run-up to the 1994 election, there were massacres in
black townships and on trains carrying black commuters. Violence
between supporters of the African National Congress and the Inkatha
Freedom Party left thousands dead in this province, KwaZulu/Natal.
``There was the very real possibility of a civil war in this
country,'' Kaizer Nyatsumba said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though there is still occasional political violence in
KwaZulu/Natal, Inkatha and the ANC govern in coalition in the
province. And Inkatha is included in the ANC-dominated national
government.
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of the world, this is a country that functions
highly successfully. The telephones work, expressways connect
cities and suburbs, the indicia of a modern society are all around.
</P>
<P>
   But for visitors who knew the old South Africa, there is
something more important. People of different races mix where they
never could: on beaches, in airline cabin crews, everywhere. And
despite the brutal racism of the old regime, there is a sense of
good will in day-to-day human relations.
</P>
<P>
   It hardly needs to be said that, economically, the gulf between
white and black remains enormous. This is a country of suburbs
reminiscent of Beverly Hills _ and of shantytowns.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges are daunting. But the oppressive weight of a
police state _ something that could be felt almost physically in
the old days _ is entirely gone. It is a land of possibility.
</P>

   BUSH GOES BACK HOME AFTER IOWA WIN WHILE (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMES, Iowa _ Flush with a victory in the Republican straw poll
here, Texas Gov. George W. Bush looked ahead Sunday to next year's
primary season and the race for his party's presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But the non-binding poll designed raise funds for the state
Republican Party in Iowa has led at least one candidate, Lamar
Alexander, to reconsider the race. Alexander called his sixth-place
finish ``a disappointment'' and said he would decide within the
next few days whether to continue his second run for the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a powerful force in this country to elect George W.
Bush,'' Alexander said Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next day or two I'll be thinking about that,''
Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has raised a record $37 million for his presidential
campaign, shattered straw poll records when he received 7,418
votes, more than three times the number of votes logged by any
previous winner in the event's 20-year history. He then flew back
to Texas, where he was scheduled relax with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he took a big step toward earning the Republican
nomination,'' Karen Hughes, Bush's campaign spokesman, told a news
conference here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides sought to put the best spin on their win with 31
percent of the vote and to fend off criticism from Republican
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   But billionaire magazine publisher Steve Forbes was quick to
point out that more than two-thirds of the voters at the straw poll
cast their ballots for candidates other than Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no coronation,'' said Forbes, who portrayed
himself as ``the conservative alternative'' to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has led a chorus of candidates who have complained about
what they say is the favoritism shown Bush by the party leadership
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who spent some $2 million to challenge the Texas
governor here, placed second with 4,921 votes.
</P>
<P>
   He attacked Bush for failing to outline a presidential agenda.
``Money plus no message equals mush,'' is one of Forbes' rhetorical
themes.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Mueller, his spokesman, said Forbes' proposals to shore up
Social Security and to improve the healthcare system and schools,
have helped him generate support needed to challenge Bush for the
party's presidential nod.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's front-runner status has made him the target of attacks
from other candidates who remain bunched at the bottom of most
public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the acknowledged front-runner,'' Michigan Gov. John
Engler said of Bush. ``He has everybody shooting at him.'' Engler
supports Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, a former president of the Family Research Council,
questioned Bush's commitment to conservative issues and causes.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer placed fourth behind Elizabeth Dole, the former American
Red Cross president, but ahead of TV commentator Pat Buchanan,
radio personality Alan Keyes and former Vice President Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom were Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., a military hero who called the Iowa straw poll ``a
scam'' because campaigns purchase tickets for those attending and
voting. McCain skipped the event.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle was pummeled in the straw poll, placing eighth. The poor
showing could doom his campaign but he vowed to press on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to New Hampshire,'' Quayle said after he spoke to
those attending the straw poll at Hilton Coliseum at Iowa State
University.
</P>
<P>
   A record 23,000 people participated in the one-day event,
according to state GOP officials.
</P>
<P>
   Although the non-binding straw poll is designed to raise funds
for the party, the hype escalated this year when Bush boasted that
he would win it and win it big.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent roughly $850,000, including the cost of more than
10,000 tickets for potential voters, who were bused to the event
and offered barbecue and entertained with country and western and
Tejano musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes spent more than $1 million on television advertising. He
also spent nearly that much on transportation, T-shirts, an
air-conditioned tent and entertainment for his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, the Texas governor's chief political strategist, said
the Bush campaign recruited hundreds of volunteers to generate a
turnout that ``would give us a convincing win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had everybody's fire aimed at us and a million dollars in
advertising aimed at us, and we still came out on top,'' Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we didn't even start campaigning here until June 12, 1999.
Some of these other candidates have been here since June 12,
1909,'' he quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Rove said the effort was designed to ``jump-start the
organization'' as it heads toward the Iowa caucuses, which kicks
off the party primary season sixth months from now.

who Macy's says can't take the cash, posed free.

   _Upon hearing that Brown wouldn't be able to get the .com domain

registered many Brown-related .com names _  &UR; Bob Cullinan &LR;  offered

</P>
<P>
   San Franciscans argued over a giant foot statue?  &UR; David Harris &LR; 
forwards a story about Recife, Brazil, where plans for a
30-foot-tall penis-shaped tower with a light on top were greeted
with such acrimony that the mayor threatened to kill a newspaper's
art critic and gossip columnist.
</P>
<P>
   The statue was designed by  &UR; Francisco Brennand &LR; , a ceramicist
known for works hinting at sex. He said, however, that the tower
was supposed to be a beacon to outer space.
</P>
<P>
   After images were shown on TV, &LR;  and the public complained, a
city committee asked the artist to alter his design. He quit on
August 4, smashing another work in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Then the newspaper's gossip columnist and art critic wrote that
the committee's request was due to pressure from the mayor's wife,
who didn't like the work. This so raged the mayor that he went to
the newspaper to confront the writers, in the course of which he
opened his jacket to flash the gun he was carrying.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian Press Association met in Rio to register
disapproval of the threat to freedom of the press. After which,
said Reuters, the city council gave Brennand permission to complete
the work as originally designed.

be given to a favorite charity of each, with one exception: Brown,
who Macy's says can't take the cash, posed free.

   _Upon hearing that Brown wouldn't be able to get the .com domain

registered many Brown-related .com names _  &UR; Bob Cullinan &LR;  offered
him free the use of williebrown.to or a whole range of names in the

   &UR; GIANT BEACON BECKONS CRITICISM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   San Franciscans argued over a giant foot statue?  &UR; David Harris &LR; 
forwards a story about Recife, Brazil, where plans for a
30-foot-tall penis-shaped tower with a light on top were greeted
with such acrimony that the mayor threatened to kill a newspaper's
art critic and gossip columnist.
</P>
<P>
   The statue was designed by  &UR; Francisco Brennand &LR; , a ceramicist
known for works hinting at sex. He said, however, that the tower
was supposed to be a beacon to outer space.
</P>
<P>
   After images were shown on TV, &LR;  and the public complained, a
city committee asked the artist to alter his design. He quit on
August 4, smashing another work in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Then the newspaper's gossip columnist and art critic wrote that
the committee's request was due to pressure from the mayor's wife,
who didn't like the work. This so raged the mayor that he went to
the newspaper to confront the writers, in the course of which he
opened his jacket to flash the gun he was carrying.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian Press Association met in Rio to register
disapproval of the threat to freedom of the press. After which,
said Reuters, the city council gave Brennand permission to complete
the work as originally designed.

of the  &UR; Julia Roberts &LR; - &UR; Susan Sarandon &LR;  movie ``Step Mom,'' which
she said was ``one of the most sexist, anti-female movies I've ever
seen. The husband actually gets his ex-wife to give him her
blessing to marry a younger woman. She gets death. He gets a sexy
young woman and no guilt. Susan tried to call it a woman's movie. I
don't think so.''

TONI MORRISON'S NEW BOOK PUZZLES ADULTS  
 THE NEW YORKER GOES LONG AGAIN  
 PARALLEL LANGUAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The imaginary characters in Toni Morrison's first book for
children live in a pretty brown box, decorated with beanbag chairs
and stocked with pepperoni pizza and Bubble Yum.
</P>
<P>
   But the reason Patty and Mickey and Liza Sue inhabit a cozy
carton in ``The Big Box'' is not pretty: They are ``kids who can't
handle their freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an edgy message for a children's book that some young
readers embrace while adults initially considered it ``weird'' and
``depressing'' in focus- group research conducted in June by the
book's publisher, Hyperion, at a school in Port Washington, N.Y.,
on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morrison, winner of the 1993 Nobel Prize for literature and
author of ``Paradise'' and ``Beloved,'' said in a statement to the
publisher that she had written ``a subversive story of adults not
listening to children.''
</P>
<P>
   Her book, which is scheduled for publication in September,
explores the limited world of children who are placed in a big
brown box by doting adults unnerved by their actions. There is
Patty, who talked too much and sang in class, or Mickey, who erred
by sitting on a Honda. The adults return for weekly visits with
presents of ``Barbie and Pepsi and a Princess Phone'' or an
aquarium of plastic fish and a picture of blue sky.
</P>
<P>
   The book is inspired by the experiences of Ms. Morrison's son,
Slade. When he was 9 in the 1960s, Ms. Morrison said, he was hurt
by a teacher's remark that he ``couldn't handle his own freedom.''
Ms. Morrison collected his comments and organized them into a
rhyme, but she had a hard time convincing the adults in publishing
that parents would buy a book describing the plight of children
trapped in an environment where things are more important than
love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told that it was unsalable,'' Ms. Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Disney's Hyperion acquired the book for its new
imprint, Jump at the Sun, which publishes children's literature
exploring African-American culture. It is convinced that Ms.
Morrison's themes will find an audience as it did with a focus
group of fifth-grade students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids really understand what it is to be in a big box,
whether it's their parents punishing them or overscheduling them,''
said Andrea Davis Pinkney, executive editor of Jump at the Sun.
``The parents took it more at face value, but came to realize that
they were doing what Ms. Morrison described in her book: that
adults frequently confine and squelch their children.''

<P>
   Microsoft at Length in The New Yorker
</P>
<P>
   The Aug. 16 issue of The New Yorker magazine harked back to an
earlier time: the pre-Tina Brown days of the 23,000-word article,
when the magazine was prone to 50,000-word stories about arcane
subjects like zinc mining or the history of corn.
</P>
<P>
   The investigative piece about the antitrust lawsuit against
Microsoft Corp., ``Hard Core,'' by Ken Auletta, was the longest by
far published under David Remnick, the editor who took over from
Ms. Brown last July.
</P>
<P>
   The subject lent itself to a lengthy treatment: arcane antitrust
issues, Byzantine cyberspace maneuvers, the plot's tempestuous
central character, Bill Gates. Indeed, Auletta portrayed Gates, the
chairman of Microsoft, more as an angry adolescent than the
billionaire defendant in one of the century's most important
lawsuits _ a characterization Auletta later put forth in television
and radio interviews as well as in his opus in The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Auletta began to report the story under Ms. Brown in May 1998,
when the Justice Department filed its antitrust suit, but it
expanded under Remnick, who suggested that he devote a full year to
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Remnick said last week that he had not intended to evoke The New
Yorker of old.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be the longest piece I have run, but it is by no means
an aberration in terms of effort spent, or time, or ambition,''
Remnick said. ``There will be more of this kind of reporting, and
it is expensive. It is expensive in terms of the reporter's time
and resources. And what's great about this piece is that it marries
storytelling and reporting and goes for almost an entire issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Auletta said that Remnick read through the piece, which was
originally 68,000 words, seven or eight times. It was published at
23,000 words.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was involved early on in the process,'' Auletta said. ``He
said, `Let's wait and do it right.''' Meanwhile, Auletta _ who
suggested that the trial had irreparably harmed Microsoft's image _
said he had not yet heard from Gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not heard a word,'' he said. ``Total silence. Then
again, I'm not really surprised.''

   Journal Article on Nixon Conjures Deja Vu
</P>
<P>
   A California radiologist, Charles Pfaff, was reading The Wall
Street Journal's editorial page last Monday when he felt a sense of
deja vu. The article he was reading, ``The Day Nixon Said
Goodbye,'' by the former president's confidante, Monica Crowley,
seemed familiar.
</P>
<P>
   He was right. The article paralleled a 1988 piece in Commentary:
``In Praise of Richard Nixon'' by Paul Johnson. Some parts were
repeated almost verbatim.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal said in an editor's note Friday that there were
``striking similarities.'' It added, ``Had we known of the
parallels, we would not have published the article.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson wrote of the Nixon administration, ``There was none of
the personal corruption which had marked the rule of Lyndon
Johnson, let alone the gross immoralities and security risks of
John F. Kennedy's White House.'' Ms. Crowley wrote, ``There was
none of the personal corruption that had marked the rule of Lyndon
Johnson or the base immoralities and outrageous security risks of
the Kennedy and Clinton White Houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also wrote, ``In thus rehabilitating himself, Nixon
displayed courage, endurance, persistence, patience, skill and _
there is no other word for it _ magnanimity. The greatness of his
heart is something his enemies never dreamed he possessed, and it
helps explain their misunderstanding of his nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Crowley wrote: ``Throughout his self-rehabilitation, Nixon
displayed courage, endurance, patience and skill. But perhaps most
importantly, he showed great magnanimity, a quality that his
enemies never counted on and that helps explain why they so
misunderstood his nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone on Friday afternoon, Ms. Crowley, the
author of ``Nixon Off the Record'' (Random House, 1996) and ``Nixon
in Winter'' (Random House, 1998), agreed that ``there are clear
similarities in the language. I have wracked my brain, and I can
honestly tell you that I have not read'' Johnson's article.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not, nor would I ever, use material from a source
without citing it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her point ``that Nixon always put the country first at critical
junctures'' had, she said, ``been out there a long time.''

JAPANESE WAR VETERANS SUPPORT NATION IN STRENGTHENING MILITARY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The young would-be soldiers in spotless uniforms hoisted
vintage rifles and marched smartly in the scalding heat Sunday.
Occasionally, a few veterans of World War II would join them at the
head of their formations, withered and bleary-eyed but still bolt
erect.
</P>
<P>
   Loudspeakers blared out everything from prayers of peace to
right-wing calls to arms on this day of commemoration of the end of
that war.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of the the former combatants who gathered at the
Yasukuni Shrine, the Shinto monument to Japan's war dead, Sunday
was simply a day for honoring lost comrades, catching up with old
friends and reminiscing.
</P>
<P>
   Driven in part by the perceived growing threat of a missile
attack from North Korea, from the rising sense of insecurity in
East Asia, and from a general weariness with war guilt 54 years
after World War II ended, Japan has broken out of its reticence
about the country's military past, just as it has begun pushing to
build up its feeble defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week the government won ratification of bills that
make the country's rising sun flag and its national anthem, a hymn
to the emperor, the legal symbols of the nation for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The government has also said that it will soon seek changes in
the country's so-called peace constitution to let Japan cooperate
more fully with the United States in regional military operations,
and to organize its own ``collective self-defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say the Japanese air force must be given the authority to
strike back in case of attack by North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   But for the dwindling remainders of an older generation _ men in
their 70s or older who were the last Japanese to fight a war _ all
of these ideas are, if anything, way overdue, although many
disapproved of the way younger Japanese men paraded about in
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, their view of the world is a bittersweet mixture
of yearning for the power that Japan once enjoyed and both pride
and resignation over the station this country has attained.
</P>
<P>
   Eight government ministers attended the ceremony at the Yasukuni
shrine Sunday, and Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and Emperor Akihito
went to a ceremony elsewhere, where they made routine anniversary
statements of regret.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to do away once and for all with a lingering national
shame over Japan's militarist past, Hiromu Nonaka, the most senior
aide to Obuchi, recently proposed that the country's worst war
criminals somehow be dissociated from the more than two million
ordinary soldiers with whom they were enshrined here. That would
allow government ministers to come here without embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has to assume responsibility for the last war,''
Nonaka said recently, explaining his controversial proposal. ``We
want to have the Class A war criminals take the responsibility and
have them enshrined somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the veterans here Sunday, almost to a man, any discussion
of the past involves an evasion of history's harder facts and yet a
grudging acceptance of the way things have turned out in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is a Class A or a Class B criminal,'' asked Taro Yamada,
a 77-year-old pilot whose unit was training to fly kamikaze attacks
when the war ended? ``We certainly didn't decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonaka is a cheater for playing around with such issues.
Government officials should not be worrying about the feelings of
other countries. They should simply come to the shrine to pay their
respects like everyone else does.''
</P>
<P>
   Like scores of other war veterans on this blistering day, Jiro
Takeda, a former Imperial Army engineer, took refuge in the cool
shade of the shrine's cherry trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who do you think the Class A criminals sacrificed themselves
for,'' he asked, as cicadas cried piercingly and white pigeons
flocked on the ground nearby? ``For the country, of course,'' he
quickly volunteered.''
</P>
<P>
   Through conversations like these, a view emerges of a generation
of men who, naturally enough, love their country deeply, but who
have only rarely managed to look history in the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last war was fought to make things better,'' said Kanjio
Suzuki, a 67-year-old who was training for combat as a young
teen-ager when the fighting ended. ``They say that we attacked, but
the truth is that we were forced into war. If you look at Taiwan or
South Korea, they have become good countries because of our good
administration. We educated those people.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost no one in this crowd seemed prepared to acknowledge that
Japan is still widely loathed by many Asians for a militaristic
past marked by war atrocities, sexual slavery and economic
exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of our efforts, Indonesia, Burma, and Malaysia
were liberated,'' said Takashi Matsui, a 71-year-old pilot who saw
action in those countries. ``If not for us, they would still be
colonized.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, another man, a bemedaled 80-year-old who wore the
uniform of a sergeant but declined to give his name, said: ``The
idea was to prosper together with the other Asian nations. It was
natural for us to take a leadership role, even if our military
sometimes went too far.''
</P>
<P>
   If few of these grizzled veterans could find fault with their
country's past, many seemed deeply ambivalent about Japan today.
For men like these who fought with extraordinary tenacity against
the United States in the briefly brilliant _ and then disastrous _
campaign known to the Japanese as the Pacific War, it is still hard
to swallow Japan's very much junior partnership with the United
States in today's world.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, for even the bitterest among them, the famous
capacity for compromise among the Japanese seems to have reconciled
them to the nearly irreconcilable.
</P>
<P>
   One after another, these men said that if they hated relying on
the United States for Japan's defense, they recognized the
prosperity this relationship had brought their country and believed
that in today's world there is little choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope is that Japan can take charge of its own affairs one
day and not just be the kind of place that catches the flu when
America sneezes,'' said a 71-year-old naval veteran who would give
his name only as Nouguchi. ``Most of all I'd like to see Japan take
up its own defenses. But with all of the constraints binding us
today, that just seems impossible.''

<P>
   UNIONVILLE, Mo. _ With hog manure fouling streams in the rolling
countryside of northern Missouri, the giant pork producer Premium
Standard Farms agreed early this month to pay $25 million to settle
a suit accusing it of violating the state's Clean Water Act.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with the hog company, which processes 2 million
pigs a year in six Missouri counties, is the largest environmental
settlement with any hog-producing operation in the United States
and illustrates the tightening restrictions facing the big
producers.
</P>
<P>
   With pigs now being raised in virtual factories, the settlement
by Premium Standard Farms of the suit brought by Missouri Attorney
General Jay Nixon comes as states are starting to monitor livestock
production as they would a smokestack industry.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Kansas, the State Health Department announced
this month that it was requiring farms with more than 10,000
animals to line their waste pits with plastic, a measure designed
to keep manure out of groundwater and prevent it from contaminating
drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Several states have declared moratoriums on expansion of giant
hog farms. Dozens of counties around the nation have passed
measures designed to limit or exclude big hog farms. Nebraska has
kept the hog factories out by banning all corporate farming.
</P>
<P>
   There are few issues as contentious in the American countryside
as the corporate hog industry, in which the manure of thousands of
pigs is concentrated in lagoons and then sprayed over fields. The
process can create a terrible odor for miles around. And when
spills occur, the manure seeps into streams and kills fish. Premium
Standard was accused of several spills, including one near here,
that killed fish and threatened groundwater.
</P>
<P>
   While most attention on big hog operations has focused on the
offensive odor, water pollution caused by the manure poses the
biggest threat, environmentalists say. The Sierra Club has labeled
big hog operations as one of the most serious threats to the
nation's environment. The giant hog farms have degraded some 35,000
miles of rivers and streams in 22 states, said Ed Hopkins, a
spokesman for the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hog operations are still classified as agricultural,'' Hopkins
said, ``but they have turned into industrial sites.''
</P>
<P>
   When Premium Standard Farms sprayed animal waste on fields, it
was technically doing the same thing farmers have always done, but
in much larger amounts. In small amounts, in the style of family
farmers, the manure served as fertilizer for crops. The
concentrated manure from the hog factories, on the other hand, is
much too strong for crop fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement with the state, Premium Standard Farms must
treat the waste before it is spread on the land, to guard against
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Many politicians in Missouri and other states have labeled the
big hog producers, like Premium Standard, as threats to the
environment as well as the rural economy. The big hog producers,
meanwhile, say environmental rules are being used as a weapon to
keep out an emerging industry that does not fit with the rural
tradition of the family farm.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Drabenstott, a vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank
in Kansas City and an expert on the rural economy, said the hog
industry had largely chosen to expand in the West, including the
Oklahoma Panhandle and Utah, which is new territory for growing
hogs. As scrutiny of hog operations intensified, Drabenstott said,
the differences in regulations between states became smaller.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is going to go where it feels welcome,''
Drabenstott said. ``These days, the discussion is not so much
whether we go to Iowa or Missouri _ it's do we stay in the United
States or do we go to Mexico?''
</P>
<P>
   Big hog producers have started raising some pigs in the western
provinces of Canada and are said to be considering doing the same
in Mexico, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tougher regulations come at a time when hog prices have ranged
from poor to catastrophic. The low prices have driven many smaller
farmers out of business and have hurt the big producers, too.
Prices for hogs at meat processors, now about 36 cents a pound,
have rebounded considerably from a low of less than 10 cents a
pound last December.
</P>
<P>
   The rising prices have been fueled, in large part, by
expectations that the economy is improving in Asia, a major
importer of American pork. But even at 35 or 40 cents a pound, most
farmers are barely breaking even, Drabenstott said.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Arnott, a spokesman for Premium Standard Farms, said the
state had been justified in ``holding us accountable'' on water
pollution. But Arnott said the debate over large-scale hog
production in the American countryside was often driven by emotion
and nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott said that the increases in technology, along with the
global nature of markets, had forever changed the face of
agriculture. But he said the big-scale hog producers were helping
people survive in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``What everybody is interested in is a quality rural way of
life,'' he said. ``It isn't the same as the old style of
agriculture. But there are a whole lot of people in Northern
Missouri who now are able to live in the country, send their kids
to a rural school and enjoy the neighborly quality of life,''
because of the 2,400 jobs created by the hog producer.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Siemer, a 27-year-old barber, had left his depressed
hometown of nearby Princeton nearly a decade ago, but as economic
conditions improved vastly in the region, he was able to return
home and go into business. His father, who had gone broke in
farming, now drives a truck for Premium Standard Farms.
</P>
<P>
   To the younger Siemer, who goes by the name Ace, a little odor
of hog manure is worth the benefit of jobs. He said the water
pollution was being exaggerated for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a ghost town not long ago,'' Siemer said. ``Now I
look out my door and I see a restaurant, an insurance agency, a gas
station.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the view of Terry Spence, a 52-year-old cattle farmer and
a sharp critic of the big hog factory, the countryside is being
sold down the river. He said the state did not win nearly a large
enough settlement from Premium Standard Farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have grandchildren, and I don't like them to be outside when
this odor gets so bad,'' Spence said. ``This is not the typical
farm smell. Animals have always roamed the land. But when you
compound it like that, it's terrible. It isn't farming. Call it
something else.''

RUSSIAN PEACEKEEPERS ARE UNEASY IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALISHEVO, Yugoslavia _ As a Russian armored personnel carrier
rumbles slowly through an Albanian village, the children on the
street shout and make mocking V-signs at them, for the Albanians'
victory over the Serbs, Russia's fellow Slavs. The soldiers look
down at them, their faces blank.
</P>
<P>
   Russian peacekeepers in Kosovo, part of the NATO-led
peacekeeping force here, are having an unhappy time. Even in the
rolling hills and woods of central Kosovo, where life is quiet and
security is good, the Russians are being made to feel
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   The personnel carrier pulls into a clearing to relieve a unit of
paratroopers manning a checkpoint, who look tired after a sleepless
shift. Several times during the night, prowlers had walked into
trip wires, sending off the warning flares that the Russians had
placed around the camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not sleep all night,'' said Senior Lt. Gennady
Kharitonov, of the 106th Paratrooper Division. The paratroopers had
spotted at least one man running off in the night, and the next
morning they surprised another. They found a blanket where he had
been lying in the woods and observing their post.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could be a sniper, or a scout _ we don't know what,''
Kharitonov said. Another post in their area had been fired upon,
although it appeared to be just a warning shot, he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other peacekeeping unit, the Russians have become
a target of the local Albanians, in whose name they are keeping the
peace. A Russian soldier was shot in the shoulder on Thursday by a
sniper while on guard duty in Robotovo, in eastern Kosovo. The men
in Malishevo have had no casualties yet but are already feeling the
local hostility.
</P>
<P>
   The area they have been allotted in central Kosovo is easy in
one respect: It is populated only by ethnic Albanians, so there is
no continuing ethnic strife, as there is elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But Malishevo and the surrounding wooded hills were a center of
activity of the guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army. It
remains a stronghold of guerrilla support, and the local commander
maintains an office in the police station in the center of the
village.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla army appears to run the show here, and its members
are refusing to cooperate with the Russian troops at all. According
to the local guerrilla commander, Habib Paqariz, Russian
mercenaries fought alongside Serbian forces in the area and were
involved in atrocities. Even if the Russian paratroopers had
nothing to do with that, he said, they were of the same nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians are here against our wishes, and we will continue
to be against that, but in a peaceful way,'' said a guerrilla
commander in Malishevo, who gave his name only as Mustafa.
</P>
<P>
   So they are ostracizing the Russians. Based in a camp between
the hospital and the school on the southern edge of the village,
the Russian troops are treated almost like outcasts. The local
commanders refuse to meet with them, and even the hospital refused
their assistance, says Lt. Col. Nikolai Greshchnikov, the Russian
liaison officer in Malishevo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children shout `Russia kaput!' and more when we drive
through the nearby village,'' Kharitonov said. ``We know it is
because the adults say it at home, and they hear it and repeat
it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Russians know the stories about the mercenaries, and some
say it is true that a unit calling themselves the Czar's Wolves,
probably veterans from the Chechen war, were in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Step by step we are showing them that we are not Russian
mercenaries but people, and representatives of KFOR,'' Greshchnikov
said, using the acronym for the peacekeeping force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians are treading carefully around local sensitivities.
They are on their best behavior. In the street a soldier tips his
cap at an old man.
</P>
<P>
   The local Albanians, although unhappy about the presence of
Russian troops, find little concrete to complain about.
</P>
<P>
   ``They beg cigarettes off us,'' complained Zulzim Javoli, a
local trader who drives a Mercedes. ``And they wanted to swap some
diesel for cigarettes.'' Yet Javoli and a cousin conceded that they
brought a truck of produce through the region every day without
problems.
</P>
<P>
   And even the Kosovo Liberation Army finds little to complain
about. The Russians took some chairs and tables from the local
school, says Mustafa, the commander. And they drive too fast, he
adds.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, despite a healthy suspicion of the guerrillas, are
giving them an easy ride. Like other troops with NATO, they know
that the fighters are failing to hand in weapons and disarm, as
they are supposed to, yet the Russians are not conducting
aggressive searches. They have confiscated some weapons and
arrested a couple of highway robbers in the last weeks, but little
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go into houses and seize weapons, we would have a big
problem here, and it would not solve the problem of disarmament,''
Greshchnikov says.
</P>
<P>
   Kharitonov adds, ``Nothing is simple here.''

GOLD-MEDAL HURDLER COMPETES DURING TREATMENTS AFTER MASTECTOMY 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a summer of improbable sporting comebacks, Lance Armstrong,
the cancer patient turned Tour de France winner, now has company.
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Lyudmila Engquist, the Russian turned Swede who won
the gold medal in the 100-meter hurdles in the 1996 Olympic Games
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Like Armstrong, Engquist has had to overcome cancer to compete.
But unlike Armstrong, whose triumph came three years after his
cancer was diagnosed, Engquist did not wait until her chemotherapy
had ended to resume racing _ and excel at it.
</P>
<P>
   She discovered a lump in her right breast in late March and had
a mastectomy on April 21, which happened to be her 35th birthday.
She began chemotherapy treatment in May.
</P>
<P>
   After the fourth of her six scheduled chemotherapy sessions, she
returned to the track for a meet in Stockholm on July 30. With her
doctors' approval, she has postponed the next session until two
days after the world championships, which will begin Saturday in
Seville, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people believe that cancer is the end, but that is not
what I believe anymore,'' Engquist said earlier this month in a
hotel lobby in Monte Carlo, Monaco, several hours before running in
the Golden League meet there.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I have done and what I am doing, I understand it's
special. In the world, a lot of people have cancer and a lot of
people have big problems handling it mentally. People don't know
what to do or how to react. If I can help them with this by going
out and doing my sport, then I'm happy to speak out about what has
happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In Stockholm, the crowd was thoroughly aware of her
circumstances. Her illness and treatment have generated intense
publicity in Sweden, and as she walked into the Olympic stadium to
compete in her first race in more than a year, there was a standing
ovation that was more a standing roar and tears from many fans and,
soon, from Engquist, too. When her name was announced as she stood
behind the starting blocks, her fellow hurdlers applauded and
Engquist began crying again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily, I stopped crying when it came time to run,'' she
said. ``But I lost concentration. For the first time in my life, I
just ran. I didn't think about technique or anything. I just ran.''
</P>
<P>
   She would have been happy just to finish, but she ended up
winning in a time of 12.68 seconds, only 18-hundredths off her best
performance in 1996. When she crossed the finish line, she leaped
into the arms of her husband and manager, Johan, and they shared a
long embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, Stockholm was more emotional than my gold medal in
Atlanta,'' she said. ``I don't think anyone has seen something like
that in an athletics meet. It was just beyond belief.''
</P>
<P>
   Marion Jones, the American sprint star, said, ``I've read that
I'm supposed to be the superwoman, but I think Lyudmila is far more
deserving of the title.''
</P>
<P>
   Engquist ran an even better time last Wednesday at the
Weltklasse meet in Zurich, finishing in 12.66 seconds to take
second place behind Olga Shishigina of Kazakstan (12.55).
</P>
<P>
   Among those in the stands in Stockholm was Dr. Arne Ljungqvist,
the Swedish physician who is a vice president of the International
Amateur Athletic Federation and head of the cancer foundation in
Sweden. Ljungqvist, a longtime friend, was the first person the
Engquists called in a panic after her biopsy results showed
malignancy in late March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed when I saw her running,'' Ljungqvist said. ``That
she won was a total surprise to me and to my colleagues. It was a
great moment, interesting from both a sports and a medical point of
view, because I think it shows that if you are fortunate, a disease
like this and the necessary treatment may not be incompatible with
leading a very active life.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that the feats of Engquist and Armstrong were
exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``One has to be careful here to make sure that people who cannot
cope so well with their situation should not feel inferior,'' he
said. ``Her physical strength, like Armstrong's physical strength,
were beneficial to them. The stronger you are, the more resistant
you will be to any type of trauma. Highly trained sportsmen are
certainly in better position to cope, but her recovery and comeback
is sensational. I would never have dreamed of her being back on the
top international level this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither would the Engquists when they prepared for chemotherapy
this spring. If all went well with her treatment, their goal was
next year and the Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning, my personal doctor was joking that maybe
it's possible to make some competition in September after the
chemotherapy, but it was like joking,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the joke would soon be on the prognosis. Already, the day
after her mastectomy, Engquist had raised eyebrows among the nurses
by doing squats beside her bed.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Do you need some medication? Do you have pain? You must have
pain,''' Engquist said, cheerfully mimicking the nurses. ``I kept
telling them that I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Johan Engquist said: ``When she had the operation, the therapist
and doctor said, `You are welcomed back in six weeks, and then
we'll have a session together with other women, and you will learn
how to lift your arm.' And we just looked at each other and
smiled.''
</P>
<P>
   Engquist said she was using small weights after five days and
was doing clean-and-jerk exercises with weights exceeding 120
pounds after one month. She now wears a prosthetic breast on and
off the track and has continued training throughout chemotherapy,
although her husband said that on the advice of doctors, they had
cut her training to half its customary level to lessen the risk of
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early days of this type of chemotherapy, the normal
cells were difficult to protect,'' Ljungqvist said. ``The drugs
which killed the cancer cells also killed the others and could make
you feel bad physically and mentally. But as time has gone on, we
have learned how to perfect the system. And Engquist's success
sends an interesting message to other people in the same situation
that you can lead a fairly normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Engquist said she began seriously considering competing again in
June.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, it was like perhaps some small competitions, but I
don't like small competitions,'' she said. ``I like big crowds, big
stadiums. It's horrible to just train and train without any
payoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's success had been a source of some comfort to her.
``I don't know much about cycling, but after I started to think
about competing this year, there was a lot in the Swedish
newspapers about Armstrong,'' she said. ``Our situations are not
the same. From what I understand, he started to compete two years
after chemotherapy. I started to compete while it's going on. But
our sports are different, too, and I don't think if I would be a
cyclist, it would be possible to do what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Engquist has landed on her feet in
the wake of considerable adversity. Born and raised in the Soviet
Union and a mother at 18, she won the world hurdles championship in
1991, but in February 1993, after testing positive for steroids,
she was banned from the sport for four years.
</P>
<P>
   She maintained that her estranged husband at the time, Nikolai
Narozhilenko, had planted the steroids in a protein powder
supplement. Narozhilenko admitted as much in a Russian court, where
the ban was lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The International Amateur Athletic Federation, citing its
exceptional circumstances rule, reinstated her in December 1995.
After receiving Swedish citizenship on June 25, 1996, in the wake
of her marriage to Johan Engquist, she became the first Swedish
woman to win an Olympic gold medal in track and field the next
month, by an eyelash in the 110-meter hurdles. Natasha, her
16-year-old daughter from her first marriage, is now a promising
sprinter for Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I've said too often now, maybe this up and down makes my
life a little bit more interesting, a bit different because you
have something to react to and overcome,'' Engquist said. ``I like
to fight. It's my nature, my way of being. It stimulates me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Engquist already refers to her cancer in the past
tense, she acknowledged she had yet to win this fight. ``It's day
by day, hurdle by hurdle,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Engquist will make no predictions for Seville. Her goal is to
reach the final or ``maybe, maybe, maybe'' even win a medal.
</P>
<P>
   In Monaco two weeks ago, in a race featuring the world's top two
hurdlers, Shishigina and Glory Alozie of Nigeria, she had to settle
for fourth place in 12.67 seconds. She did not get the chance to
stand on the podium, but she did not leave Monaco without a prize.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the race, some Swedish fans hurled a bouquet
of flowers onto the track. And as midnight approached and Engquist
answered the last of so many questions from her adopted nation's
news corps in a corridor inside the stadium, she was still
clutching the flowers and the message they came with: ``For us, you
are the best.'' &QL;

SHORT NEWS ITEMS FROM THE WORLD OF ADVERTISING 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AGENCY EXECUTIVE SUES HIS EMPLOYERS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michael E. Kassan, president for North American operations at
Western Initiative Media Worldwide in Los Angeles, part of the
Interpublic Group of Cos., has sued Western and Interpublic for
breach of contract and defamation of character, asking for damages
totaling $63.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kassan charged that Interpublic was ``orchestrating a scheme''
to either force him to resign or invent a reason to dismiss him and
to ``ruin his reputation'' with actions that included disseminating
statements that he ``was on an extended leave of absence from
Western because of his role in financial misconduct.'' He is
seeking $50 million in damages through arbitration with the
American Arbitration Association and $13.5 million in a lawsuit
filed in Federal District Court in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Trade publications reported in July that Kassan, who joined
Western in 1994, had suddenly taken a monthlong leave of absence.
Subsequent articles described Interpublic's conducting a financial
audit or internal investigation at Western. But Western later
issued a statement that the leave had ``no connection whatsoever''
to work by Kassan or Western on behalf of clients.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of a news release about the contentions in Kassan's
lawsuits, issued on his behalf, raised eyebrows. It was sent to
reporters late on Friday afternoon _ and many agency executives are
typically absent from their offices on summer Fridays. So it was
not surprising that several telephone calls to executives at
Western and Interpublic in Los Angeles and New York were not
returned. That meant their responses to the charges would appear in
articles after the charges were reported.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE MARKETERS SELECT AGENCIES
</P>
<P>
   Several ``dot com'' advertisers have named agencies to handle
their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Living.com in Austin, Texas, a Web-based home products retailer,
selected two divisions of the Leo Burnett Co. in Chicago as the
first agencies to handle its account, with billings that were
estimated by the trade publication Adweek at $25 million. Burnett
USA will handle branding duties and Starcom Worldwide will handle
media duties. The decision came after a review that had been
narrowed to the Burnett divisions and two other finalists:
McCann-Erickson Southwest in Dallas and Houston, part of the
McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising unit of the Interpublic Group
of Cos., and Richards Group in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   AFB Multimedia Inc. in New York named Bozell Kamstra in New
York, part of the Bozell Worldwide unit of True North
Communications, as the first agency to handle the account of
AFBnews.com, a news service devoted to crime, courtroom proceedings
and penology. Billings were estimated at $20 million. The decision
came after a review that had been narrowed to Bozell and two
unidentified finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Storerunner.com in San Diego awarded its branding and marketing
account to three Omnicom Group units, DDB Worldwide in New York,
Interbrand and Porter Novelli. Spending was estimated at $15
million for the rest of the year. The decision came after a
two-week review that had been narrowed to the Omnicom agencies and
undisclosed finalists. The CBS Corp. bought 50 percent of
Storerunner.com in April for $100 million worth of commercial time
on CBS television, radio and online properties over six years.
</P>
<P>
   And Furniture.com in Framingham, Mass., named Bartle Bogle
Hegarty U.S. in New York, the American unit of Bartle Bogle
Hegarty, to handle branding campaigns for the online furniture
retailer. Billings were estimated at more than $5 million. The
decision came after a two-month review; the other participants were
not identified. Bartle Bogle will work with agencies that already
work for Furniture.com, which include Neil Faber Media Inc. in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   FINALISTS NAMED FOR INTERNET WORK
</P>
<P>
   Three Internet-related companies in New York have narrowed
reviews on accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Newspage.com named four finalists in a review for its first
branding account, with billings estimated at $10 million to $15
million. They are Chadwick Communications in New York; TFA/Leo
Burnett Technology Group in Boston, part of the Leo Burnett Co.,
and Grey Advertising in New York. In addition, Pro Media Inc. in
Natick, Mass., will compete with those agencies for the off-line
media buying and promotion duties.
</P>
<P>
   Real Media Inc., an Internet marketing company, named four
finalists in a review for its trade account, with billings
estimated at $2 million to $3 million. Real Media and M&AMP;C Saatchi
in New York, which had been hired in September, parted ways over
what were described as creative differences.
</P>
<P>
   The finalists, all based in New York, are: DeVito/Verdi, Hanft
Byrne Raboy &AMP; Partners, Mezzina/Brown and Stein Rogan &AMP; Partners. A
decision is expected by the end of August. Lot 21 in San Francisco
remains the Real Media interactive agency.
</P>
<P>
   And Gfn.com, the Gay Financial Network Inc., which operates a
Web site aimed at gay men and lesbians, named three finalists in a
review to find the first agency to handle its account, with
billings estimated at almost $2 million. Matthew L. Papa, associate
marketing manager at Gfn.com in New York, identified the finalists,
all in New York, as: Interactive8, Mad Dogs and Englishmen and
Prime Access. A decision is expected in a month, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ACCOUNTS
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co.'s European operations, London, to
Leagas Delaney, London, to handle creative duties for its account,
which had been at McCann-Erickson London, part of McCann-Erickson
Worldwide Advertising, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Cos.
Billings were estimated at $20 million. McCann-Erickson London
continues handling media duties. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo Wellcome, Research Triangle Park, N.C., to Robert A.
Becker Inc. Euro RSCG, New York, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide
unit of Havas Advertising, to handle the account of the drug
company's Serevent Inhalation Aerosol, an asthma treatment.
Capitalized billings were estimated at $7.2 million. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bcandid, Boulder, Colo., to Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS, New York, part
of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Cos., as the
first agency to handle creative duties for the account of the
developer of Internet group-discussion software. Billings were
estimated at $5 million to $10 million. D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP;
Bowles, Los Angeles, part of MacManus Group, handles media duties. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PEOPLE
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey L. Johnson was named to the new post of president for
the Florida operations of West Wayne Inc., Atlanta, responsible for
offices in Miami and Tampa. He had most recently been a consultant;
he previously worked for agencies like Wells BDDP, New York. &QL;
</P>
<P>

Imaging, Concord, Mass., and New York, functioning as chief
operating officer. He had been chief operating officer at Arnold
Communications, Boston, part of Snyder Communications. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michael Oxman was named to the new post of business development
director at Euro RSCG Tatham, Chicago, part of the Euro RSCG

`HISTORY OF SEX' IS LIGHTHEARTED WITHOUT BEING FLIPPANT OR VULGAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you read this column you won't go blind. Really and truly.
</P>
<P>
   But it is about sex, so those who don't like reading about sex,
talking about sex or learning about sex may want to wander
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   For those who stayed, welcome to Sex 101, courtesy of The
History Channel. Yes, indeed. The History Channel, home of ``Great
Ships'' and ``Tales of the Gun,'' finally goes beyond the merely
metaphorical with a five-part series this week called ``The History
of Sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone thinking ``why The History Channel?'' right about now
should consider this: At the end of Monday's first episode, airing
at 7 and again at 11, narrator Peter Coyote says soberly, ``Without
sex there would be no history.''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it, folks: the perfect justification for a
programming decision. And since this is a History Channel project,
Monday night's installment features a clip of the Japanese attack
on Pearl Harbor. No kidding. And for real history-of-sex buffs,
there's also footage from World War I, with shots of some awfully
big guns.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, even on a channel where war footage isn't so much
symbolic as it is compulsory, the battle scenes are intended to
illustrate the point that American soldiers were exposed to
different cultures and views on sexuality when they went overseas.
The clips are outnumbered, probably a thousand to one, by still
images of erotic art over the five-night run.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't ``Real Sex'' on HBO. Despite the erotica _ the
series is rated TV-14 _ and Monday night's heavy dose of Hugh
Hefner and Helen Gurley Brown, ``The History of Sex'' is not about
titillation, even if the real reason for its existence is to
attract a younger audience than the one customarily drawn to The
History Channel. Scholarly in approach and wide in scope, ``The
History of Sex'' is a laudable attempt to open eyes and minds to
widely disparate takes on human sexuality since the first utterance
of ``not tonight, honey, I have a headache.'' At its best, though,
it is a broad survey of sexual mores and practices through the
ages. Viewers should not expect a probing examination of sex and
its impact on the single planet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in one-hour doses over five August nights, ``The History
of Sex'' is a painless and moderately entertaining way to learn
that, in ancient Mesopotamia, buoyancy could be the deciding factor
in cases of adultery. Couples suspected of doing the deed were
often tied up and thrown in a river. If they floated, they were
innocent; if they drowned, they were guilty. And they probably
didn't do it again.
</P>
<P>
   In other societies, however, there was no stigma attached to
adultery or homosexuality or polygamy, and ``The History of Sex''
deserves praise for issuing no moral pronouncements. For instance,
its reference to one of the first pornographic films in this
country, circa 1915, passes no judgment aside from an allusion to
its randy title (``A Free Ride'') and its creators (a director
identified as A. Wise Guy and a cinematographer named Will B.
Hard).
</P>
<P>
   The series begins Monday night with an installment titled ``The
20th Century,'' hence the appearance of Hefner, Brown and Dr. Ruth
Westheimer to discuss the ``sexual revolution'' and how movies and
the back seats of automobiles contributed to the carnal education
of American society. Tuesday w night, ``From Don Juan to Queen
Victoria'' looks at extremes of sexual behavior, ranging from the
Puritans to the Marquis de Sade, and subsequent installments survey
``The Middle Ages,'' ``The Eastern World'' and _ my favorite _
``Ancient Civilizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Lighthearted without being flippant, ``The History of Sex''
bounces from topic to topic like an ancient Chinese husband from
concubine to concubine. (The Confucian book of rites required him
to have sex with each at least once every five days until the
concubines reached the age of 50.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The History of Sex'' would be more enjoyable, or at least less
distracting, if it weren't so obviously an American production hung
up on how explicit it should dare to be. Though there's plenty of
graphic sexual imagery, the viewer is shortchanged many, many times
by prudish editing that crops an image and thus undermines the, uh,
thrust of a particular passage in the script.
</P>
<P>
   Seems odd that a channel so accustomed to showing the ravages of
war can't bring itself to go all the way when it comes to matters
of the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   History of Sex. Five-part series airing at 7 and 11 Monday
through Friday on The History Channel. Parental guideline rating:
TV-14.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+

SCIENTIST'S JOB CHANGE SEEN AS THREAT TO OBJECTIVITY OF STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A scientist directing a key study on genetically
engineered crops at the prestigious National Academy of Sciences
left last month for a job with the biotechnology industry, angering
environmental scientists who fear that the final report will be
biased toward the industry's points of view.
</P>
<P>
   E. William Colglazier, the executive officer of the academy,
said the scientist, Dr. Michael Phillips, violated the
organization's ethical rules, which require staff members to report
any conflicts they might have with industries affected by the
academy's studies.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips did not tell academy officials until a few days before
he left that he had been hired by the Biotechnology Industry
Organization, a trade association in Washington that represents
more than 800 biotech companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no knowledge until he left that he was taking a job
with the Biotechnology Industry Organization,'' Colglazier said.
``If we had known, we would have not had him work on that
committee.'' But he also said the undisclosed conflict had not
biased the study.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Biotechnology Industry Organization said
that neither Phillips nor the association wished to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy is another setback for the closely watched
study, which is expected to have a profound impact on how
regulators decide to oversee the hundreds of new organisms that the
biotechnology industry is creating. Soon after the panel of
scientists was formed in March, some environmentalists said it
contained too many experts with direct ties to the biotechnology
industry, so the composition of the committee was altered to better
reflect the environmentalists' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the academy, which is the leading dispenser of
scientific advice to the federal government, will be one of the
first comprehensive efforts to examine the risks and benefits of
the relatively new development of genetically modified crops. The
panel is focusing on plants that have been engineered to produce
their own pesticides, and whether federal regulators are properly
monitoring the new plants.
</P>
<P>
   The biotech industry maintains that the products are safe for
the environment and for the humans who consume them, but there is
not enough data to verify that claim.
</P>
<P>
   Colglazier said he did not believe Phillip's undisclosed
conflict had biased the study. Members of the scientific panel are
reviewing a draft of the report, he said, adding, ``The committee
members are free to make whatever changes they want.''
</P>
<P>
   The study is expected to be completed this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips told panel members on July 6 that he was leaving, but
he did not say where he would be working, said Dr. Rebecca
Goldburg, a scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund who is on
the biotech panel.
</P>
<P>
   On July 20, the Biotechnology Industry Organization, based in
Washington, touted its hiring of Phillips in a press release. The
association said Phillips would have a ``key role in representing
the agbiotech industry on domestic policy and international trade
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Goldburg and other environmental scientists said they
believe Phillips had been discussing a job offer with the
association while he was directing the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Phillips had a serious conflict of interest,'' Dr.
Goldburg said, adding that she was concerned that the integrity of
the panel's report would be tainted.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists on the panel are investigating a form of the
biotech crops that have been genetically altered to produce their
own pesticides. The most popular of these is a corn plant that
contains a toxin in its tissues that kills corn borer pests.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, American farmers planted millions of acres of this
pesticide-producing corn. Some environmentalists have warned that
the new crops could kill insects that are not pests. Some of those
fears were verified recently in a laboratory experiment when
researchers found that monarch butterflies died when they ate
pollen from the modified corn.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency requires biotech companies
to perform certain studies to determine what effects their products
will have on the environment. While some scientists say that
federal regulators are not doing enough to protect the environment,
others say the regulatory burden is too great.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, who was director of the Board on Agriculture and
Natural Resources at the academy, helped to find outside experts to
sit on the panel. He also participated in all of the panel's
meetings, Dr. Goldburg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always had this revolving door between government and
the biotech industry,'' Dr. Goldburg said, ``but now we have a
revolving door between the industry and the academy. Given that the
academy is supposed to play a dispassionate role in the making of
public policy, I think this is very unfortunate.''

   HATE-GROUP-STRATEGY _ Over the last few years, hate groups in
this country have changed their strategy. Instead of being
organized in identifiable groups, they have fragmented, experts on
terrorism say, with leaders providing the philosophical fodder and
individuals _ called Lone Wolves _ or pairs, doing the killing. The
idea, some experts say, is leaderless resistance and it often makes
it difficult for law enforcement to stop acts of terrorism. By Jo

<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAGH, Northern Ireland _ A year ago Sunday, shortly after 3
o'clock on a sunny afternoon in this quiet market town in the
Sperrin Mountains, Donna Marie Keyes, her fiance and his
21-month-old niece were shopping for a pair of fancy little shoes
in a store named McElroy's on Market Street, when a policeman
rushed in and told them of a terrorist bomb threat.
</P>
<P>
   They should move down Market Street, away from the courthouse,
he told Ms. Keyes, Gary McGillion and little Breda, who needed
shoes to dress as a flower girl at their wedding a week later.
</P>
<P>
   But the bombers, a splinter group of the Irish Republican Army,
had given police a misleading warning, resulting in hundreds of
shoppers being herded toward, instead of away from, the maroon
Vauxhall Cavalier that held 500 pounds of explosives.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Keyes, McGillion and Breda came within a few feet of the
car, the bomb exploded. A shop sign fell on Breda, who was in a
stroller, and killed her; Ms. Keyes and McGillion were sliced by
flying metal and burned over most of their bodies. The explosion
killed 29 people and wounded another 400 _ the deadliest single
bomb attack in 29 years of sectarian warfare in this British
province.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Omagh is a town of lingering grief and trauma.
Many of the injured and their relatives still refuse to come
downtown, fearing another bomb, not wanting to remember images of
the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, several thousand people in this town of about
25,000 did return to Market Street, as the city marked the first
anniversary of the bombing with Catholic and Protestant prayers and
hymns in front of the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel a lot of sadness and sorrow,'' said Ms. Keyes, now 23,
who married McGillion in March. She spent six weeks in a coma and
has a long scar on her forehead. ``But we are lucky,'' she said.
``We have the gift of life. Our hearts are with Breda.''
</P>
<P>
   McGillion, 25, a mechanic and an amateur heavyweight boxer
before his arms and legs were sliced by metal shards, and who still
has a piece of steel in his right ear, said he is unable to go to
his job fixing tractors and earth diggers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My boxing days are now over,'' he added. He is a coach with
the Omagh boys' boxing club, which is traveling overseas for a
tournament in Yonkers, N.Y., in November.
</P>
<P>
   A director of the club, Joe Byrne, who is also a mainstream
Catholic member of the Northern Ireland Assembly in Belfast, said
Sunday morning: ``As I drove around the town there was a mood of
reflection and sadness. People are subdued today. I went to buy the
newspapers. No one else was in the shop. Normally it would be
crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming majority of republican guerrillas, like the
Real IRA, which acknowledged that it planted the bomb, are Roman
Catholics. So are Ms. Keyes and McGillion; so was Breda; so are 65
percent of the people who live here. Thirty-five percent are
Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   Police say privately that, after a year of investigation and the
questioning of 4,000 people, it is unlikely that the bombers will
ever be caught.
</P>
<P>
   The Real IRA is one of the Catholic paramilitary groups that
opposes the 1998 peace agreement that is supposed to end the
violence. The Catholic dissidents see the agreement as a sellout to
Protestants because it does not provide for a union of British
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, to the south.
</P>
<P>
   In the months after the blast, people were encouraged by visits
from President Clinton and Prime Ministers Tony Blair of Britain
and Bertie Ahern of Ireland and many other politicians. Thousands
of people from all over Ireland came here to do their Christmas
shopping and pray for the residents.
</P>
<P>
   Many people thought that maybe the bomb attack at Omagh would be
the last major atrocity of the sectarian fighting, that it would so
horrify ordinary people and political leaders that a permanent
peace would soon follow, with a resolution of disputes between
Catholics and Protestants at the Northern Ireland Assembly in
Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   But that has not happened. Sporadic paramilitary violence
continues in the province. On Saturday, Catholics protesting
Protestant parades in Londonderry, north of here, threw gasoline
bombs at police and seriously damaged several stores and banks.
</P>
<P>
   As the new violence adds to the tally of those scarred by this
conflict, the people of Omagh are themselves still wounded, still
suffering, physically and psychologically. Scores have been unable
to return to work, still traumatized by what happened to them and
their loved ones. The Bridge, a government-financed trauma center,
says 250 people are still being counseled.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a sense of sadness and painful anticipation of
this weekend,'' said the trauma center's director, Michael Duffy,
of Sunday's commemoration. ``All the emotions and the memories are
so vividly resurrected. People have not dealt with their nightmares
and their flashbacks. They still see all the carnage, suffering and
distress of that day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Their sense of security is affected,'' Duffy said, adding that
scores of the injured victims and their families could not bear
coming downtown to Market Street, on Sunday or any day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a foreshortened sense of the future,'' he said.
``Many are afraid there will be another bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Some, Duffy said, have been helped by the center's 20
psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers, who have studied
American analyses of the trauma of Vietnam war veterans. The
patients are also reminded of their own plight when they learn of
the series of fatal shooting incidents in the United States.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most of the survivors of the Omagh attack, Duffy added,
acknowledge that the news coverage of the bombing and its aftermath
had helped bring in about $10 million in aid. As the anniversary
approached, they gave many interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Two teen-age girls were shown several times on television, one
learning to swim in a pool with one normal leg and the thigh-stump
of the other. Another was shown wearing a plastic mask protecting
her face wounds, still healing. Both have decided to give no more
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media will move on to the next tragedy,'' Duffy said,
without rancor. ``And we have to deal with this ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Business has suffered on Market Street, where 10 stores and
shops, including McElroy's, destroyed by the blast are being
renovated with government money. Patrick Bogues, owner of a jewelry
shop, noted without smiling that his family had moved the business
from Belfast after it had been bombed by German planes in World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   The Christmas shopping by out-of-towners, he said, ``gave the
town economy a tremendous fillip'' but the momentum could not be
sustained. ``Now people come out of curiosity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of wedding rings were down, he noted, adding, ``But maybe
that's because a lot of people want to be married in the new
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Police say that they are working hard on the investigation. They
say they have arrested and released about 60 people after
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   The only person charged is Colm Murphy, a pub owner in Dundalk,
across the border in County Louth. He was charged in the Dublin
Special Criminal Court with conspiring to carry out an explosion.
But no trial date has been set and he is free on bail and is not
suspected as one of the actual bombers.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, police say it is unlikely they will ever catch the
bombers. Despite the widespread condemnation of the attack, there
has been no help from informers. ``All they have to do is pick up a
phone and tell us that they know something,'' said one officer.
``But they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   At the ceremony Sunday, people waited silently, watching the
courthouse clock as it approached 3:10, the time of the blast. Some
wept. Parents clutched their small children, a few of whom laughed
and shouted, heedless. As the clock reached its mark, a bagpiper
played a mournful song, easily audible at the spot on Market Street
where baby Breda went for new shoes.

 &HT;    Bush leaves shattered dreams in his wake
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMES, Iowa - The candidate who got here last came in first and
left a Sunday death watch over the presidential dreams of some of
the also-rans.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, who didn't declare his candidacy until June
12 and spent only nine days campaigning here, won the Iowa GOP
straw poll Saturday and now waits to see if the field will narrow.
</P>
<P>
   Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander headed home Sunday to
``reconsider my candidacy'' after running sixth and picking up only
6 percent of the straw vote that drew 24,000 participants.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Vice President Dan Quayle, who launched a verbal assault on
Bush at the straw poll, ran eighth, collecting only 3.9 percent.
Quayle played the happy warrior Sunday, heading to campaign stops
in New Hampshire and downplaying his down-ballot finish in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Third-time candidate Pat Buchanan, who ran fifth with 7.3
percent of the straw vote, indicated his days as a Republican may
be numbered.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, who spent more time campaigning here than any of the
GOP contenders, set up Iowa as a do-or-die effort for himself. He
had the backing of former four-term Gov. Terry Branstad and a
statewide organization.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday he sounded like a candidate planning an exit strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a powerful force in this country to nominate George W.
Bush,'' he said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' ``And there is a
powerful force out there, too, I think we saw last night, to have a
contest. But I'm not sure I did well enough last night to be a part
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander said he has been unable to penetrate media perception
that Bush is ``the inevitable nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can't find a way to overcome that in the country and the
media it doesn't make much sense for me to go ahead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And while some candidates claim Bush does not have the
experience to be president, Alexander noted this curiosity of the
straw-poll results:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little unnerving to stop and think about the fact that
of the first five finishers in the straw poll they have five total
years of experience in elective office. And George Bush has all of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the straw poll results, Quayle, already campaigning in
New Hampshire, said nothing happened in Iowa to deter his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go on,'' he said on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' adding
that, like Bush, he got into the Iowa straw poll race later than
most. ``We are very well positioned now to do very well and
hopefully win the (Iowa) caucuses. That's when the votes really
start.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, also speaking on ``Face the Nation,'' said he remains
intent on winning the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe I'm the one candidate who disagrees most
profoundly and most extensively with Governor Bush,'' he said. ``I
think we are going to emerge as the conservative challenger to
Bush. It hasn't happened yet.''
</P>
<P>
   During the straw poll, Bush urged Buchanan not to leave the GOP.
Buchanan said he could make no promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going right now down this road,'' he said of seeking the
Republican nomination. ``If the Republican Party moves off in a new
direction, it moves off. I don't know exactly where I'm going to be
in August of 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain, who did not participate, said Sunday
the event was ``a meaningless, kind of senseless thing.'' He also
said he might not compete in the Iowa caucuses that kick off the
delegate hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to fight on ground that is most favorable to
you,'' he said.

STUDY SHOWS SOME DONATED DRUGS WERE OUTDATED AND USELESS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By REED ABELSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Public health officials have long suspected that many drugs
donated to aid groups to be sent overseas do not meet local medical
needs or are likely to expire before they can be used. A new study
by the Harvard School of Public Health concludes that concerns over
the quality of donated drugs are well founded.
</P>
<P>
   The study, to be released Monday, is the first to look closely
at drug donations from the United States _ a byzantine process that
is rarely made public by drug manufacturers or relief agencies. The
study focused on two major American relief agencies, which
cooperated on the condition that they not be identified, and used
field studies in three countries, Armenia, Haiti and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Most drugs donated and sent over the two to three years of the
study _ between 1994 and 1997 _ were considered useful and helped
those in need. And the study cited many examples of how the
donations improved the quality of life in various countries.
</P>
<P>
   But a significant amount of donations _ anywhere from 10 percent
to 42 percent, looking at the figures from the two agencies in each
of the three countries _ were not listed by the recipient country
or the World Health Organization as high-priority drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that, looking at worldwide data from the
aid agencies, about 30 percent of the drugs had a year or less
until expiration, and 6 percent had less than 100 days.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, local health facilities in Haiti, for example,
reported that they received many drugs that did not meet their
needs and many that had expired.
</P>
<P>
   World Health Organization guidelines say drugs should be given
at least a year before the expiration date because of the time it
takes to distribute them, and most drugs have a much longer shelf
life. Expired drugs can lose their effectiveness, and many relief
workers feel that donated drugs should meet the same standards as
those used at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are problems and issues at all levels,'' said Michael R.
Reich, a professor of international health policy at Harvard who
conducted the study.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that relief organizations, drug companies,
charities, local governments and the hospitals and clinics all
share responsibility for making sure that donations are handled in
a way that will determine whether the drugs meet local medical
needs, and all bear some responsibility for the large amount of
waste.
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers concerned about the problem say that as long as
pharmaceutical companies can expect valuable tax breaks and a way
to rid themselves of excess inventory when they donate goods, the
stream of unwanted donations is likely to continue. Charities, too,
benefit by handling these gifts, since they can be used to magnify
the size of their programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the study did not address American tax law but focused
instead on actions the relief agencies and companies could take.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Reich said, the study may paint too bright a
picture for having relied on the cooperation of charities whose
data and practices may have been better than average. ``There is a
real need for all these organizations to think hard about their
practices,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The study was sponsored by the Partnership for Quality Medical
Donations, a group formed by drug companies and relief agencies to
try to improve their donations. Reich emphasized that the study was
conducted independently and not reviewed by the sponsors before
being sent to press for publication Monday in the Bulletin of the
World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Reich's work ``suggests there is a good deal that is useful
about these donations, but that there is a lot of work to be
done,'' said Jim Russo, the executive director of the partnership.
``Now we know where we stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its analysis, the study also provided fresh anecdotal
evidence about shipments of unwanted drugs _ drugs that did not
meet the specific needs of the country or were likely to expire
before they could be used.
</P>
<P>
   In Haiti, for example, individuals who hand-carried medicine
into the country in response to local requests were seen as a
better source of needed drugs than the American relief agencies,
which deal in bulk. Those agencies were viewed as having ``a
container ready to go'' and eager to send the drugs whether or not
they addressed the specific needs of the local hospital or clinic,
according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the nine health facilities surveyed reported that half of
the drugs reaching them had already expired.
</P>
<P>
   And in Armenia, despite the government's strong role in
screening donations, many health facilities were given large
supplies of combination remedies that contained both a painkiller
and a decongestant. Combination drugs are less useful because
patients might not need both. ``Unpacked boxes of the product were
observed, stacked on floors and on top of shelves up to the
ceilings,'' the study noted.
</P>
<P>
   The study was not conducted during periods of particular crisis
in each of the three countries, when the quality of donations might
worsen, Reich said. The reports of relief workers in Albania and
Macedonia earlier this year suggested that much of the aid
streaming into the region during the Kosovo crisis was
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Although Albania itself could supply only about a fifth of the
drugs and medical supplies needed by its hospitals, according to
the World Health Organization, many of the drugs that arrived had
expired or were unfamiliar to local health professionals.
</P>
<P>
   The cost to local hospitals or clinics of inappropriate or
unusable drugs is significant. Not only is safe disposal expensive
because of various local regulations, but in some countries
recipients must also pay to transport the drugs or pay fees to the
government based on the value of the donations. If the donations
are no good, that is money that could have been spent on more
useful drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In surveying various companies and relief agencies, the Harvard
group found a wide range of drug-donation policies. Reich called
for more uniform standards among both donor companies and the aid
agencies and more discussion of whether donations are appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone agrees that there is a need for better definitions of
best practices,'' he said. The World Health Organization's
guidelines on what drugs should be donated have helped raise
overall awareness, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership, which is currently composed of seven drug
companies and six charities, plans to meet this fall with the World
Health Organization to try to improve the process of drug
donations, Russo said.

STUDY DISPELS SOME OF THE MYTHS ABOUT HIRING OLDER WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The thing many older workers fear most is being discounted
because of their age, especially when they go to look for new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Although employers insist they don't discriminate, many older
workers would say otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   So which is reality?
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Sabin Forte, the business outreach coordinator for
Bates Technical College in Tacoma, Wash., recently published
results of research looking at employer attitudes toward both older
and younger workers.
</P>
<P>
   The results, published in the March volume of the Journal of
Employment Counseling, are surprising.
</P>
<P>
   In her work with displaced workers, Forte frequently heard older
job seekers complain that no one wanted to interview them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to say to them, other than, `Hang in
there,''' she said. So she and Christine Hansvick, associate
professor of psychology at Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma,
decided to find out how older workers _ those over age 50 _ were
regarded by potential employers.
</P>
<P>
   The assumption among older workers, backed in part by research
by others, was that younger workers were generally viewed more
favorably than older ones, she said. ``We wanted to test that
hypothesis.''
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing myths were that older workers weren't as quick to
learn, their energy was lower, and they didn't have the computer
skills to keep up with their younger counterparts, she said. ``The
big perception is that they aren't as up to date.''
</P>
<P>
   Forte and Hansvick surveyed more than 300 employers in the
Pacific Northwest, asking them to rate workers under age 49 and
those over age 50 on a range of attributes. The attributes were
attendance, work ethic, stamina, productivity, academic skills,
computer skills, ability to learn new skills quickly, flexibility
and openness to change, ability to get along with co-workers,
willingness to take direction, supervisory skills and appropriate
salary expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The results only partially supported the premise that older
workers are viewed less favorably, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Older workers actually scored better than their younger
colleagues in six of the attributes. They were judged more
favorably on academic skill levels, attendance, ability to get
along with co-workers, work ethics, salary expectations and
supervisory skills.
</P>
<P>
   Younger workers were judged more favorably on computer skills,
ability to learn quickly, energy and flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Employers also indicated they perceived no differences when it
came to willingness to take directions, or productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Job seekers can use that information to help them prepare for
interviews, Forte said. It can help them address the issues that
are likely to be lurking in the back of an interviewer's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a twofold strategy,'' she said. ``You need to capitalize
on the positive attributes, and assuage fears about the
negatives.''
</P>
<P>
   If computer skills are important to the job, for example, the
older worker should state up front that his computer skills are up
to date (assuming they are), rather than assume the interviewer
will know that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless they're told otherwise, (a potential employer) may
assume an older worker's skills aren't as current,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Older workers should also pay special attention to first
impressions, she said. Having an outdated haircut and clothes can
reinforce the stereotype that an older worker is resistant to
change.
</P>
<P>
   It's especially important that older workers go into an
interview armed with examples or anecdotes to reinforce any
positive bias the interviewer already has toward older hires. And
they should be prepared to show how they might compensate for
perceived weaknesses, such as having less stamina or less facility
at learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is we do learn a little differently as we get
older, but we also have more experience,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And a willingness to learn goes a long way toward compensating
for some slowing in the grasp of new concepts.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is as the population ages and older workers
increase as a percentage of the labor force, more employers will be
faced with hiring older workers.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is people are working for a longer span of time. The
workplace is changing at an unprecedented rate.
</P>
<P>
   No one has the luxury of kicking back and saying they know it
all.
</P>
<P>
   That goes for all workers _ young and old.

 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a profession whose leaders are known for their
devotion to the works of military strategists like Carl von
Clausewitz and Sun Tsu, the officers of the U.S. Army and the
Marine Corps have quietly chosen a romantic war novel as the truest
mirror of their lives and ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once an Eagle,'' by Anton Myrer, has worked its way over a
generation into the mindset and lexicon of the American military,
flourishing as a cult classic even as it withered out of print and
vanished from most bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
says it is the only book he has ever read twice. The Army War
College in Carlisle, Pa., recently brought the book back into print
because military schools wanted it for courses in ethics and
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   When it was first published in 1968, the epic story of an Army
officer as honorable as Robin Hood pitted against a fellow officer
as self-serving as Prince John became an improbable best seller
during the upheaval of those times, its 800 pages tracing the story
of the U.S. Army from World War I to the early years of Vietnam.
The book eventually sold millions of copies.
</P>
<P>
   For the military, it was not just a book but a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   The protagonist, Sam Damon, is a soldier's soldier, a
hard-fighting commander filled with concern for his troops who wins
battle after battle in both world wars but is eventually killed on
a mission trying to persuade the powers-that-be that the U.S.
military should not get involved in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   His antagonist, Courtney Massengale, triumphs over Sam Damon by
manipulating the political system in Washington and making all the
right career moves, even though he disdains the rank-and-file and
sends his soldiers into certain death in his first command in World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly the story you would expect to move the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really got a cult following in the Army because Sam Damon
is the officer you hope you will be and Courtney Massengale is the
officer you hope you don't work for,'' said Col. Jerry Morelock, a
recently retired history professor at the Command and General Staff
College at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., where Army officers are trained
for higher command.
</P>
<P>
   The book is on the Marine Corps commandants' reading list _
making it required reading for all Marines. The U.S. Army War
College holds an annual leadership seminar that uses the book. For
West Point cadets, who are assigned the book in classes and
seminars, reading ``Once an Eagle'' has become a rite of passage,
much like discovering ``Catcher in the Rye'' as a teen-ager.
Favorite passages are quoted routinely, especially Sam Damon's
dying words: ``Joey, if it comes to a choice between being a good
soldier and a good human being _ try to be a good human being ...''
</P>
<P>
   And the names of Sam Damon and Courtney Massengale have entered
the language of the U.S. military as code words for the good
officer who thinks first of the troops and the other one who thinks
only of personal gain.
</P>
<P>
   When Shelton wants to exclude a candidate from a promotion, all
he has to do is tell the board of review: ``This is another
Courtney Massengale.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a household name and I've used it to say we shouldn't
have an individual like that in the ranks _ someone who is
motivated for all the wrong reasons, someone you don't want leading
the troops,'' Shelton said.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Damon, on the other hand, is a cult hero whose name has been
painted by soldiers on their tanks and whose career and life,
including the strain of constant moves and marital strife, are
viewed as a mirror of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been without a copy since college,'' said Col.
Gregg Fontenot, who was a battalion commander in Operation Desert
Storm in the Middle East, served in the Bosnia peacekeeping
operation and retired this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several times I've decided what to do after figuring out what
Sam would do,'' Fontenot said. ``At mid-career at the staff college
at Fort Leavenworth, I agonized whether to go on for a second year
of studies. It wasn't stylish in the Army then. But Sam studied
military history at night and I wanted to be like Sam. So I
stayed.''
</P>
<P>
   The novel had special appeal during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ``The novel arrived just when soldiers needed it,'' wrote Gen.
Sidney Berry, the former superintendent of the U.S. Military
Academy at West Point, who was one of those junior officers in
Vietnam. ``Many soldiers felt cast-off and unappreciated, sorry for
themselves, ashamed of wearing the uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it rose to become No. 1 on The New York Times list of
paperback best sellers in 1976 just as the Army was undergoing an
agonizing self-examination after the fall of Saigon, eventually
selling more than 3 million copies. And as the captains and
colonels of Vietnam became generals in the 1980s and 1990s the
novel became their touchstone. In 1976 it was made into a
television miniseries of the same name starring Sam Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   But the book went out of print over the next 20 years, forcing
places like the West Point Academy bookstore to order $50 editions
from reprint companies and to scrounge for copies at second-hand
bookstores. The book was reprinted in the mid-1990s, and is
available in bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book is something very special for cadets,'' said Ellen
Mohrman, who buys books at the West Point store. ``It's the type of
book officers give to students they are mentoring, it's that
important a book.''
</P>
<P>
   The book's author, Myrer, died in 1996 at age 73. He also wrote
the novels ``The Last Convertible'' and ``The Big War.'' Myrer said
his combat service in World War II had the greatest impact on his
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enlisted imbued with a rather flamboyant concept of this
country's destiny as the leader of a free world and the necessity
of the use of armed force,'' he wrote. ``I emerged a corporal three
years later in a state of great turmoil, at the core of which was
an angry awareness of war as the most vicious and fraudulent
self-deception man had ever devised.'' Some of those antiwar
feelings are reflected in ``Once an Eagle.''
</P>
<P>
   In his introduction to the newest edition, Gen. John Vessey Jr.,
who is retired and a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
writes that the book ranks with ``The Red Badge of Courage'' and
``All Quiet on the Western Front'' as a ``consummate antiwar
novel.''
</P>
<P>
   The book's continuing popularity is also based on a nostalgia
for simpler days with obvious heroes and villains, when the armed
forces were more completely separate from the civilian world and
when ``duty, honor and country'' really was the soldier's calling.

PLEASANT TEMPER KEEPS WALDEN'S STREAK GOING
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ A crucial week for fillies dawned at
Saratoga Race Course Sunday, with Magicalmysterycat primed for
Monday's Adirondack for 2-year-olds and Silverbulletday counting
down to her next appearance Saturday in the Alabama Stakes. And the
week got off to a rousing start when Pleasant Temper won the
Ballston Spa Handicap and sent Elliott Walden back to the winner's
circle as Saratoga's hottest trainer of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Walden had been spending time in the winner's circle lately
greeting such stars as Victory Gallop and Ecton Park, and he made
another visit Sunday to greet Jerry Bailey and Pleasant Temper
after they led all the way and won by nearly three lengths. It was
the second consecutive success for the 5-year-old daughter of Storm
Cat and the fifth in her last seven starts, and she clearly outran
the favored Anguilla, who finished fourth in a field of five.
</P>
<P>
   ``This mare is difficult to train,'' Walden said. ``She's very
high-strung, typical of a Storm Cat. She's settled with age. I
talked with Jerry this morning, and we decided that no plan was the
best plan. Jerry did a great job of nursing her along.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Day, who rode Anguilla, said he was trying to conserve his
mare's energy for the homestretch, but added, ``When I pulled the
trigger and called on her to run, I got no response.''
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant Temper, who is owned by Mark Stanley, ran the mile and
one-sixteenth in 1:41 4/5, finished 2} lengths in front of Cuanto
Es and paid $5.60 for a $2 bet to win as the second choice to
Anguilla. &QL; 
Giveaway Inspires Record
</P>
<P>
   The giveaway mania reached record levels Sunday at old Saratoga.
Nobody knows how many people actually attended the races, but the
turnstiles clicked 66,194 times for a track record, beating the
previous mark of 61,190 recorded on Aug. 9 last year.
</P>
<P>
   They gave away free T-shirts that day. This time they gave away
drinking steins, and many customers cheerfully paid the $2
grandstand admission or the $4 clubhouse fee two or three times in
order to go back through the turnstiles and receive free mugs.
</P>
<P>
   The track had stockpiled 50,000 steins in anticipation of the
public's response, but it still outran expectations. Even while
long lines were waiting outside the gates, public address
announcements were warning that the house had run out of mugs. But
the turnstiles kept clicking.
</P>
<P>
   STORY MAY END HERE; OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS
</P>
<P>
   ONE DOWN, TWO TO GO
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's $150,000 Adirondack, which is run at six and a half
furlongs and is the middle race in Saratoga's series of three for
juvenile fillies, Magicalmysterycat will try to repeat her winning
performance July 28 in the Schuylerville. The filly, trained by
D.Wayne Lukas, is the undefeated daughter of Storm Cat who was
purchased last year for $1.1 million. Her next goal if she wins
Monday: a sweep of Saratoga's filly honors in the Spinaway on Sept.
3.
</P>
<P>
   But her life may be complicated by the arrival of Miss
Wineshine, a Texas-bred filly in Bob Baffert's barn and a
stablemate of the undefeated West Coast star Chilukki.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to get Miss Wineshine away from Chilukki,'' Baffert
said. ``She's big, she looks like Winning Colors and she's a pretty
awesome filly. And, in my opinion, she's not that far behind
Chilukki at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   A NEW WAGERING FORCE
</P>
<P>
   The 47th annual Round Table conference of the Jockey Club (no
relation to the racing champion of the same name) turned into the
second annual report on the state of the business by the National
Thoroughbred Racing Association, which predictably reported that it
had been doing an excellent job during its 16 months as the
industry's unifying marketing force.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Smith, the commissioner of the NTRA, emphasized the
significance of the Television Games Network, a 24-hour channel
devoted to racing designed to reach a young new audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not an overstatement to say that interactive account
wagering, led by TVG, has an excellent chance of becoming the new
decade's equivalent of simulcasting,'' Smith said, ``both in
producing new distribution for our product and in leading to new
growth in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Boylan, president of TV Guide, in a report titled
``Racing's New Frontier,'' said that the goal of the new channel
was ``to entertain the masses.'' But he emphasized that its success
``depends on states' accepting account wagering.''

GIANTS' DEFENSE IS BUOYED BY PROGRESS OF OFFENSE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The Giants in recent seasons have avoided a
potentially destructive situation: becoming divided, two teams
within one. Offense over here. Defense over there. The Giants'
offense, basically, has stunk. The Giants' defense has been the
team's backbone.
</P>
<P>
   Through the adversity, amazingly, the two meshed. And remained
one.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not hide the frustration. The body language of the
Giants' defensive players and sometimes, simply, their language,
revealed their ire. Occasionally they were critical of their
nonproductive teammates. Frequently it was evident that the defense
believed hope was lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had games where our defense was on the field for 100
plays; man, that's two games in one,'' Jessie Armstead, the Giants'
All-Pro linebacker, said Sunday. ``Any coach who tries to say you
can win that way is lying and he knows he's lying. We'd get
interceptions or some kind of turnover and then the offense would
go one, two, three plays and then we're back on the field again.
We'd start to ask the offense, `Can you get one first down?'
</P>
<P>
   ``We're lucky it didn't spill over and get real nasty. The
attitude on offense has been that they get punched and then they
shut it down. Now it looks like we can punch 'em back.''
</P>
<P>
   Or even offer the first lick.
</P>
<P>
   That is the promise of the Giants' 36-21 defeat of Minnesota on
Friday night. As the Giants continued training camp at SUNY-Albany
Sunday and prepared for this Saturday's home matchup against
Jacksonville, there was a genuine feeling of relief and unity among
them. And great hope that this Giants offense is finally ready to
carry its share of the load.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe even lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that our defense has earned our bacon a
lot of the time,'' the fifth-year offensive tackle Scott Gragg
said. ``I came from an offense in college at Montana where it was
normal for us to score 50 points. That's exciting for the fans and
the players. We want more of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota game was only preseason, but the 36 points scored
by the Giants were more than they had scored in any of their last
52 regular-season games. Kent Graham's touchdown passes of 37 and
53 yards, his 145 passing yards, no interceptions and flawless
leadership were the staples. The rookie running back Sean Bennett
gained 35 yards rushing and 65 more receiving, including a 53-yard
catch and run on a screen pass for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   A quick 17-0 lead over the talented Vikings. A 20-point first
half. Seventeen first downs and 364 yards of offense, with an
average gain of 6.3 yards a play. The backup quarterback Kerry
Collins threw for 127 yards and a touchdown with no interceptions.
All merry Giants signs. And consider this: 8 of 13 Giants drives
concluded in Vikings territory.
</P>
<P>
   The starters played for only one quarter. And it was only one
preseason game. But it was such a change that there was an air of
confidence among the offensive players and excitement among the
defensive players Sunday. There are more offensive weapons,
including a calm, experienced and decisive quarterback in Graham,
more size and speed at receiver, especially in Amani Toomer as a
starter, and more solid play in the running game.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times in the past we haven't scored points, kept the
game close or held our own,'' Toomer said. ``But we got off to a
good start against Minnesota. And sometimes in practice we get
going and our defense can't stop us. They get frustrated now. They
realize we're getting better. Kent makes the difference. He changes
the whole makeup of the offense. He has confidence and he sees the
whole field and gives everyone opportunities to make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillippi Sparks, a Giants cornerback, was surprised at the
new-look offense. He said the Giants' receivers impressed him most
with their concentration, speed and communication with the
quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been very hard for our defense being out there for so
many plays,'' Sparks said. ``But what I'm seeing now from our
offense is unbelievable. It's wonderful. Now you can really start
to play defense aggressively. You get enough rest in games on
defense now to be fresher and more productive. It makes our team
whole.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, championship teams feature equal contributions from
offense, defense and special teams. In reality, one component often
becomes a team's chief identity. All three, however, must function
at least adequately.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are truly a family, a close team,'' Gragg said. ``We bite
and scratch during training camp, but we'll leave here very close
and with a better offense. That's what we need, the whole team, to
do anything special.'' &QL;

IOWA VOTE EXPOSES WILD CARD FOR BUSH JUGGERNAUT: STEVE FORBES 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMES, Iowa _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush did not merely want to
place first in the straw poll here on Saturday of Republican
presidential contenders. He wanted, as one of his advisers put it
Sunday, ``to absolutely smash everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why even members of the governor's high command were
personally, and frantically, prodding people to cast their ballots
in the final minutes of voting.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was decisive but hardly a rout. Bush won with 31
percent, and his aides boasted that he amassed 7,418 of the 23,685
votes cast, three times more than any victor in the event's
two-decade history. But his two closest competitors _ Steve Forbes,
who drew 21 percent, and Elizabeth Dole, with 14 percent _ also
turned out more people than any past winner. And seven of the 10
participants voted for someone other than the governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The voting here at Iowa State University did not alter the basic
story line of the Republican presidential race: Bush is still the
towering front-runner. Yet while Bush entered the competition here
only two months ago, the results underscored that his course to the
nomination may be turbulent. And they suggested that he will face
forceful, and perhaps damaging, challenges in the crucial
nominating caucuses here in six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are candidates who will be strong and competitive in
January and February,'' Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's advisers were most unsettled about Forbes, the
multimillionaire magazine publisher who has lavished his fortune on
the presidential race and dispensed far more money into the straw
poll than Bush.
</P>
<P>
   There was never any doubt that Forbes' wealth would give him the
opportunity to spar with Bush throughout the primaries. That, in
fact, is what drove Bush to join Forbes in rejecting federal
matching funds so he is not encumbered by spending limits. But
Forbes demonstrated on Saturday that he knows how to convert his
money into an organization that is adroit at turning people out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely wanted to do better,'' said a Bush adviser who
spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``But there was one thing we
couldn't control: How many votes Mr. Forbes could buy.'' The
adviser went on, ``We have a wild card in this race: Steve Forbes.
The danger is, he could come in and carpet bomb and force us to
spend five, six or seven million dollars just to win the Iowa
caucuses.''
</P>
<P>
   While the straw poll was designed as fund-raising scheme for the
state Republican Party, and the candidates' paid the $25 entry fee
for participants, it was also an organizational test that will
affect the candidates' fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Because Gary Bauer, the former head of the Family Research
Council, finished fourth place, ahead of conservative commentator
Pat Buchanan, Bauer is portraying himself as the standard bearer of
religious conservatives. Buchanan has hinted that he might consider
bolting the Republicans to try for the nomination of the Reform
Party.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the straw poll, Buchanan said that Bush was so far
ahead in the polls that the governor's campaign felt the ``need to
blow them all out and end it right here.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush fell short of that goal, the outcome does significantly
diminish the fortunes of former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and
former Vice President Dan Quayle. Alexander, who had devoted more
time to campaigning in Iowa than any other candidate, is expected
to suspend his campaign, perhaps as soon as Monday. He ranked sixth
place, with 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a powerful force in this country to nominate George W.
Bush,'' Alexander said Sunday on the NBC News program ``Meet the
Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, already stumping in New Hampshire on Sunday, insisted he
would soldier on, despite being humiliated with an eighth place
finish of 3.9 percent, behind Alan Keyes, a radio host.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, who entered the presidential contest
last month, placed ninth, followed by Sen. John McCain of Arizona,
who did not campaign here and scoffed at the straw poll as ``a sham
and a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the outcome was not as convincing as other, earlier
gauges of his success: a war chest that is 10 times that of his
nearest competitors and polls showing him swamping his rivals. And
in his first side-by-side performance with his rivals in the hall
here on Saturday, Bush did not electrify the crowd _ certainly not
enough to convince people to abandon other contenders in droves.
</P>
<P>
   The hope in the Bush camp is that Republicans will ultimately
stick with him because he looks like a winner and appears to have
the strongest chance to defeat the Democrats in a general election.
He enjoys deep institutional support of money and endorsements and
there is no obvious alternative. Bush's supporters are buoyed by
the fact that the second-, third-, fourth- and fifth-place
finishers have never been elected to public office.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Gov. John Engler, who was here on behalf of Bush, said
of Forbes' inheritance: ``His fund-raising is easy. All he has to
do is have a meeting of the brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   But, turning serious, he adding, ``He's dangerous because he has
money. He's less dangerous because he has no electoral record.''
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes made the case that his showing on Saturday proves
that he is electable. ``Money plus no message equals mush,'' he
said. ``Voters want real substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, the former president of the American Red Cross, benefited
from drawing women and young people to the events, what she called
``an invisible army.'' But Bush's advisers insisted that they
preferred that Dole placed third rather than, say, Bauer. They
expressed concern that if a favorite of religious conservatives was
catapulted to the top tier _ as happened with Buchanan in the New
Hampshire primary in 1996 _ that candidate could prove nettlesome
for months.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign that is probably eyeing Dole the closest is
McCain's. His advisers said Dole could complicate their plan to
emerge as a logical alternative to Bush because she competes for
some of the same support. Making her pitch Sunday, Dole noted that
she spent far less here than the first- and second-place finishers.
</P>
<P>
   The hope among her followers, and the other candidates, is that
Forbes' wealth will alienate voters. As Forbes addressed the hall
Saturday night, several strategists for other candidates looked on
with delight. He had financed a costly balloon drop when he reached
the lectern. But rival camps immediately began popping the
balloons. The noise drowned out most of Forbes' speech.

 &HT;    'Heaven's golden streets don't entice me half as much as a stand

   ATLANTA _ A friend for whom I did a slight favor said lightly,
``When you die, you're going to heaven.'' It gave me a bad couple
of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Dying is all right if you must, but heaven? I'm not sure about
that, either getting there or liking it.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be secure in your devotion to heaven! She thought I had
blasphemed. I tried to throw her off by singing a few bars from
that old spiritual, ``Evvabody talk about heaven ain't going
there.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no use pursuing the matter. Most of us who went to
Sunday school as children were probably reared with a mental
picture of pearly gates and golden streets, and no self-respecting
ad person nowadays would put that picture in a resort magazine.
</P>
<P>
   What do we want a perfect place to look like? It sounds bizarre
in view of all the troubles we've been having lately, but I happen
to like this world, the one we live in, the one we abuse, the one
we probably don't deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven's golden streets don't entice me half as much as a stand
of pretty trees. Do they have fall color in heaven? Will the sweet
gums there be gold and rose and violet in autumn? Does heaven have
mountain laurel and rhododendron in June? How about mountains and
rushing little creeks and springs of great drinking water?
</P>
<P>
   Since you think of heaven as being ``up yonder,'' what about the
sky? Is it so close to the sky, you can't get a perspective on the
silvery clouds piled against a blue heaven? I like almost any sky
mood, blue or gray or buttermilk-spattered. It's wonderful to watch
the change as you drive home from work in the late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   That's another thing. Do you work in heaven? I happen to like it
very much, but nothing I read or heard in my childhood mentioned
that there's a daily paper in heaven. Could it be that all of us
saints don't get the news?
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of saints, I worry about them. I have known a few
saintly people, and they weren't half as much fun as some who had
slipped from sainthood. A little spice, a little malice ... Is that
allowed? Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   I recently read a book about the Roosevelt women, most of whom
were descended from Georgia's Mittie Bulloch of Roswell. Mittie was
almost too good to be true, except out of sympathy for her
Confederate kinsmen, she sneaked blankets from her Yankee husband's
family and smuggled them south. Some of her descendants were good,
as witness Eleanor Roosevelt, who was so caught up in doing for
other people she missed sitting around feeling virtuous. Then there
was Alice Roosevelt Longworth, who was probably assigned to the
gossip mill if she made it into heaven. There are many stories
about her, but one I hadn't heard was that when her grown-up
brother fell down the long staircase in her house, she sat still
and observed, ``I never liked him anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta people I like a lot may not be headed for heaven, but
when the bank teller tells you to have a good Christmas, I think
she means it. Also the kid in the supermarket and the cashier at
the gas station. She doesn't speak English (do they in heaven?),
but she is cheerful and good-humored, and when she says, ``Mucho
merry to you,'' I feel warm and looked after.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't worried about the white sand and the blue water of the
Gulf of Mexico, but they're on my list of things to ask St. Peter
about if I ever get as far as the pearly gate. Train whistles and
boat whistles and dogs and cats and mockingbirds and rainy nights
and snow ... I must ask my friend and if she doesn't have the
inside word, she should be more careful about consigning some of us
to that exalted place.

 &HT;    CELESTINE SIBLEY: An appreciation
 &HT;    (EDS: IN TWO TAKES. Take one of 2. MOVING TO (a) General news
and (l) Lifestyle categories.)
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Celestine Sibley, the prodigious chronicler of a
half-century of Southern life, is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley captured the rhythm and flavor and language of the region
in more than 10,000 newspaper columns for The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, countless news stories written on deadline,
and more than 20 books.
</P>
<P>
   Before becoming known as a columnist, Sibley was a masterful
court, crime and political reporter, covering some of the area's
most lurid murder trials and the equally colorful events under the
gold dome of the Georgia Legislature. But she will be best
remembered for her column on the front of the Journal-Constitution
Features section, rich with folksy wit and universal truth.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998 she suffered heart trouble and underwent an
angioplasty. Four days later she doggedly returned to work and
reported the adventure in her typical low-key style: ``So one
night,'' she wrote, ``lacking anything more exciting to do, I had a
heart attack.'' In July 1999, when her doctor informed her that it
was unsafe for her to continue driving her car, she wrote: ``He
smiled gently and said something about it being a hard decision.
And I moved sneakily toward the window, wondering if one little
push would do it. One little lift of a rod, one little push and I'd
be a free woman again.''
</P>
<P>
   During the last few weeks, Sibley, ailing and on pain
medication, got in the car with family members at the wheel and
made a visit to the important places in her life. They drove to
Alford, Fla., where her mother, the redoubtable Muv, lived most of
her adult life. They also stopped at Holley Fla., where Sibley was
born, to pay her respects at her grandfather's grave. And she came
to rest at Dog Island, Fla., near Apalachicola, a largely
undeveloped island where for years she retreated in summers and
winters alone or with members of her extended clan at a cottage
built by her second husband, Jack Strong.
</P>
<P>
   Never willing to take herself too seriously, Sibley made for
good company at the breakfast table during her 55 years as a
columnist.
</P>
<P>
   Like Sibley herself, the columns were deceptive in their plain
attire. She dealt in the homely and homespun. She wrote about
washing and starching curtains, digging in the garden, enjoying
spring rain and summer vegetables. These topics she related without
artifice, but with an abiding love of language and a natural
raconteur's ability to spin a yarn.
</P>
<P>
   Her sharing of the small and large moments of her life at her
log cabin home, Sweet Apple, made for an intimate relationship with
her readers, who were forever mailing her packets of seeds,
cuttings from favorite plants, cakes and poems, books and music,
and letters of undying affection.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you'd go on a book signing with her it was excruciating,
because everybody had a scrapbook full of stuff that they knew she
wanted to see, and she did want to see it,'' said Atlanta mystery
writer Kathy Hogan Trocheck, a personal friend. ``And they'd all
have groceries they'd want to give her. Something about her made
people want to smoke a ham.''
</P>
<P>
   An older Atlanta reader will recall a Sibley of a different
sort, a cop shop reporter who reveled in a good juicy homicide. As
her fictional alter ego, Katharine Kincaid, the newswriting
protagonist of her first novel, ``The Malignant Heart,'' summed it
up, ``Murder is my favorite assignment.''
</P>
<P>
   She viewed the capital trial as the modern-day counterpart to
Shakespeare's theater, and she was skilled at sketching its cast of
characters. Covering the 1948 trial that would become the potboiler
``Murder in Coweta County,'' Sibley located the seemingly prescient
fortune-teller, Mayhayley Lancaster, who would lend those
proceedings their supernatural air.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was absolutely the best court reporter I ever saw,'' said
former Constitution editor Bill Shipp. ``She knew how to bring a
trial to life like nobody I've ever seen before or since.''
</P>
<P>
   She was also a workhorse, said Shipp. ``You'd send her on an
assignment, she'd give you 800 or 1,000 words on the trial, she'd
give you a sidebar on the principal lawyers, then she'd sit down
and write a column.''
</P>
<P>
   Said friend and fellow sage of Southern food John Egerton,
``That woman could write a column while I was trying to figure out
how to set the margins on my typewriter.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of her writing career, Sibley also pursued a more
exhausting job, single-handedly rearing and supporting three
children. She had unreliable help from her alcoholic first husband,
Jim Little, whom she loved dearly but who proved an unfit spouse.
He died at age 45.
</P>
<P>
   With financial help from Little often nonexistent, Sibley took
to freelancing true confession stories for pulpy magazines,
ghost-writing autobiographical tales (with titles such as ``I Sold
My Baby for $300'') about the ne'er-do-wells she met on the beat.
</P>
<P>
   Though such contributions embarrassed her full-time employer
(her editors at the Constitution, where she hired on in 1941,
eventually offered to raise her undersized salary as an inducement
to end her low-rent freelancing) Sibley refrained from exploiting
her subjects. Not even the young woman who sold her own baby was
treated poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley, as agreed, traveled to the girl's mountain home, and
read the story out loud to the girl and her wrinkled mother. She
needed their approval before she could market it to the penny
dreadfuls. While she read the somewhat purple prose, the girl began
to weep, and the mother threw her own apron over her head in shame.
Sibley soldiered on. When at last she finished, the older woman
heaved a great sigh and exclaimed, ``I do swear that's might near
the prettiest story I ever heard tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Sibley was also adept at coaxing quotes from career politicians,
which she proved while covering the Legislature from 1958 until
1978. She helped push the legislators toward much humane
legislation, said former U.S. Rep. James Mackay of Decatur. ``She
was one of the key people that said the jailhouse is not where the
drunk can recover,'' he said. ``She is credited by the Legislature
for almost singlehandedly causing the Georgia Clinic to be created.
Because of the pain she's had in her own family, she is keen to
other people's pain.''
</P>
<P>
   While at the Capitol, Sibley was often sought for counsel by
legislators, who, in 1978, passed a resolution praising her for her
coverage and just this month announced that the press gallery in
the Capitol House chamber will be named in her honor. Her friend
Dorothy Nix, an executive with the Garden Club of Georgia, once
brought a battalion of ladies to the Capitol to lobby for a law to
control billboards. Her colleagues were unimpressed with the
state's political leaders, however. ``They just wanted to catch a
glimpse of Celestine Sibley,'' said Nix. ``To me, Celestine Sibley
is the first lady of Georgia no matter who's in the Governor's
Mansion.''
</P>
<P>
   Sibley was one of the newspaper's employees closest to Ralph
McGill, the late editor, publisher and Pulitzer Prize-winning
columnist of the Constitution. He doted on her. ``If there is a
queen of our news shop, it is Sister Sibley,'' he once wrote. ``She
can put words down in a manner to excite envy among the rest of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   In later years, when McGill's desk was somehow shifted to the
Constitution's basement, Sibley rescued the rolltop and had it
placed in her office.
</P>
<P>
   Celestine Broxson Colley was born May 23, 1914, in , Holley,
Fla., near Pensacola. Her father was Henry Colley, her mother
Evelyn Barber of Alford, Fla. Though their union was not a happy
one, Barber and Colley were never legally divorced. Evelyn Barber,
who would later become famous in her daughter's column as ``Muv,''
laughed off suggestions that she was committing bigamy when she
subsequently married Wesley Reeder Sibley, a lumberman in Creola,
Ala., 18 miles north of Mobile. Sibley (who was known as Pap or
Bob) adopted the 7-year-old Celestine as his own.
</P>
<P>
   The young girl grew up among Mobile County's fishermen,
shrimpers and oystermen whom she recalled as ``self-reliant,
independent, masters of the art of make-do.''
</P>
<P>
   But they were people of the Gulf; she was not. ``We were close
in map miles but eons away in time, temperament and mores from the
salt water and even the aristocratic civilization of old Mobile,''
she wrote. ``We were piney woods people who drew our living from
the woods instead of the water.''
</P>
<P>
   At countywide Murphy High in Mobile, Sibley became editor of the
school paper. The Mobile Press-Register called asking whether any
students wanted to work on weekends. She assigned herself, and at
15 began her newspaper career. Her first story was an interview
with a legislator who had introduced a bill to make illegal the
possession and sale of marijuana. She graduated from Murphy High in
1933, and later attended Spring Hill College in Mobile.
</P>
<P>
   She worked as a full-time reporter for the Press-Register in
1933-36, and for the nearby Pensacola News-Journal from 1936 to
1941.

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (continued)
</P>
<P>
   Sibley married Little, a Press-Register copy editor, and they
took jobs in Atlanta, she with the Constitution, he with the
Associated Press. Little bounced from job to job, in Mobile,
Pensacola, Atlanta, Jacksonville, Atlanta again, Orlando, Atlanta
again, St. Petersburg and Columbus. He stayed in hotels, leaving
Sibley and their children here to live on her newspaper salary and
freelance income from magazine articles and books.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley's life never lacked for melodrama, and occasional real
tragedy. Two of her grandchildren died in infancy, one from SIDS,
the other from a fall. The sadness she knew, and her background of
poverty, gave her a heightened concern for ordinary people that,
more than anything else, made her one of the newspaper's most
popular writers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, she helped convince the state Board of Pardons and
Paroles to free convicted killer Floyd Woodward. A onetime con man
wanted in connection with a 1920 slaying, Woodward had gone
straight for years, living in California under an assumed name,
before he was extradited to Georgia and convicted in 1943. At a
hearing, witnesses testified that Woodward had acted in
self-defense. He was freed and Sibley put him on a plane to
California.
</P>
<P>
   Another of her familiar column subjects was Francis Brunton. He
was a hobo who lived under the Spring Street viaduct and rode
through downtown Atlanta on a bicycle, wearing a globe around his
neck and carrying an encyclopedia. Sibley let him use her office as
a mailing address.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley collected such characters, and her columns were peopled
with a Dickensian gallery of eccentrics and castoffs. Readers will
remember:
</P>
<P>
   _ Miss Anna May Smith, whose house was pulled down by kudzu and
who the police picked up on some minor charge. They reported to
Sibley that they discovered $10,000 sewed into her clothing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mrs. Arizona Bell, who sold papers downtown and had once
ridden in Buffalo Bill's circus. Sibley, in her own subversive way,
chose Mrs. Bell as a partner to accompany her to the Metropolitan
Opera.
</P>
<P>
   _ Miss Peavey, who loved well, but not wisely. Sibley described
one of her elderly suitors as having ``not a tooth in his head, but
the light of love in his eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Ted Hagler and Ronald Rolland, aka Ted and Shorty. Panhandlers
and longtime fixtures of the Marietta Street scene, Ted and Shorty
are among the contemporary street people who also populated the
column. ``She's just the sweetest person you could ever hope to
meet,'' said Hagler, 51.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley was loved by readers for profiling the nonfamous in her
columns, but she knew and wrote about the famous as well. In the
early 1950s, the merged Journal-Constitution sent her on annual
trips to Hollywood to write puff pieces, in her words, promoting
upcoming movies. She earned $100 apiece for the articles, which
were published in the Sunday magazine.
</P>
<P>
   On the set of ``Don't Bother to Knock'' in 1952, Sibley asked
Marilyn Monroe, ``How does it feel to be an international
cheesecake success?''
</P>
<P>
   Monroe replied: ``I just believe in doing the best you can with
what you have.''
</P>
<P>
   She never conferred celebrity on herself, however. When she was
covering the 1976 presidential campaign alongside a visiting
reporter with the University of Georgia's student newspaper, the
Red and Black, she insisted that both journalists be given equal
access. ``I talked to everyone in the Carter family because I was
with her,'' said Patricia Templeton, that student reporter, a
longtime friend, and now an Episcopalian minister, who will preside
at Sibley's funeral service.
</P>
<P>
   Years after her first husband died, she again found love, with
Jack Strong, a real estate broker and former reporter for the
Constitution, who was about 12 years her junior. For more than 40
years, they kept company with each other and finally married in
1987. In November of 1988, at age 59, he died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her heroic productivity, Sibley led a vigorous private
life, full of the enthusiasms that she shared with her readers and
many that she did not, in particular her fondness for gossip. ``She
remembered everything, especially grievances,'' quipped her
long-time editor at Harper and Row, now HarperCollins, Lawrence
Ashmead.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the columns don't reveal about her is that she was a very
intelligent, somewhat cynical, salty-talking reporter,'' said her
friend Robert Steed, a partner in the prestigious law firm King and
Spalding, and a onetime-writer of humorous newspaper columns for
The Atlanta Journal. ``She had another sharper side to her. That
was the fun side, that's why these newspaper people and reprobate
lawyers wanted to be in her company.''
</P>
<P>
   She often used her column to offer tribute to friends and other
notable Georgians who had passed away. Said columnist Jim Minter,
former editor of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution,``I'd hoped she'd
live long enough to write a column about me when I die; she could
make some pretty (lousy) people look pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Sibley would sometimes reprint letters from her readers that
questioned her ability, her taste and intelligence. She would
usually answer these with modest restraint. Occasionally her
forbearance might sag. An Americus woman wrote to berate her for
being ``leftist'' on women's rights, and for not appreciating Elvis
Presley, Anita Bryant or the television show ``Dallas.'' Answered
Sibley, ``Ah, what a lot of twaddle!''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Emerson, former Newsweek bureau chief and a friend, cited
Sibley as ``the best columnist the Atlanta newspapers have ever
had, better than Bill Arp, better than Lewis Grizzard, better than
Ralph McGill. She also knew more about the informal history of
Atlanta than any other living person, including Franklin Garrett.''
</P>
<P>
   She loved the religious drama ``Heaven Bound,'' performed yearly
at Christmas by the Big Bethel AME Church, and was such a steadfast
champion that she was awarded a pair of paper wings by the
congregation in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   She bragged on those wings more than any of the scores of awards
that she received in her career. Those awards included two honorary
doctorates, a commendation from the Legislature as ``state
treasure'' and even a piece of Ga. 140 renamed the Celestine Sibley
Highway, where she was once involved in a brush-up with a red
pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley was only the second woman to receive The Lifetime
Achievement Award from the National Society of Newspaper
Columnists, which they presented to her in June of this year ``with
envy.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Sibley received the Shining Light Award from the
Atlanta Gas Light Co., a distinction that she shared with her
mentor, Ralph McGill. The gas company installs a permanent gas
flame in honor of the recipients, and like McGill's, her lamp burns
outside the newspaper offices on Marietta Street. ``I like mine
even better than McGill's, don't you?'' she asked the charmed
audience. In her acceptance speech she joked about drafty old Sweet
Apple, saying ``I'm getting this award because I have the most
energy-inefficient house in Fulton County.''
</P>
<P>
   On that occasion, members of Big Bethel's choir sang her
favorite hymn, ``Steal Away,'' a song about freedom, eternity and
the hand of God. More than two dozen members of the
African-American church made the antiseptic newspaper conference
room ring with the old spiritual. The song felt like a fresh gust
from a rain-soaked breeze, or a news bulletin from a better place,
the kind of news that Sibley brought to her readers day after day.
Hard-nosed reporters and editors rocked back on their heels, and
Sibley beamed, her eyes shining with tears:
</P>
<P>
   My Lord calls me
</P>
<P>
   He calls me by the thunder
</P>
<P>
   The trumpet sounds within my soul
</P>
<P>
   I ain't got long to stay here.
</P>
<P>
   Steal away, steal away
</P>
<P>
   Steal away to Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Steal away, steal away home
</P>
<P>
   I ain't got long to stay here.

 &HT;    CELESTINE SIBLEY: An appreciation
 &HT;    (EDS: IN TWO TAKES. Take one of 2. MOVING TO (a) General news
and (l) Lifestyle categories.)
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Celestine Sibley, the prodigious chronicler of a
half-century of Southern life, is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley captured the rhythm and flavor and language of the region
in more than 10,000 newspaper columns for The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, countless news stories written on deadline,
and more than 20 books.
</P>
<P>
   Before becoming known as a columnist, Sibley was a masterful
court, crime and political reporter, covering some of the area's
most lurid murder trials and the equally colorful events under the
gold dome of the Georgia Legislature. But she will be best
remembered for her column on the front of the Journal-Constitution
Features section, rich with folksy wit and universal truth.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998 she suffered heart trouble and underwent an
angioplasty. Four days later she doggedly returned to work and
reported the adventure in her typical low-key style: ``So one
night,'' she wrote, ``lacking anything more exciting to do, I had a
heart attack.'' In July 1999, when her doctor informed her that it
was unsafe for her to continue driving her car, she wrote: ``He
smiled gently and said something about it being a hard decision.
And I moved sneakily toward the window, wondering if one little
push would do it. One little lift of a rod, one little push and I'd
be a free woman again.''
</P>
<P>
   During the last few weeks, Sibley, ailing and on pain
medication, got in the car with family members at the wheel and
made a visit to the important places in her life. They drove to
Alford, Fla., where her mother, the redoubtable Muv, lived most of
her adult life. They also stopped at Holley Fla., where Sibley was
born, to pay her respects at her grandfather's grave. And she came
to rest at Dog Island, Fla., near Apalachicola, a largely
undeveloped island where for years she retreated in summers and
winters alone or with members of her extended clan at a cottage
built by her second husband, Jack Strong.
</P>
<P>
   Never willing to take herself too seriously, Sibley made for
good company at the breakfast table during her 55 years as a
columnist.
</P>
<P>
   Like Sibley herself, the columns were deceptive in their plain
attire. She dealt in the homely and homespun. She wrote about
washing and starching curtains, digging in the garden, enjoying
spring rain and summer vegetables. These topics she related without
artifice, but with an abiding love of language and a natural
raconteur's ability to spin a yarn.
</P>
<P>
   Her sharing of the small and large moments of her life at her
log cabin home, Sweet Apple, made for an intimate relationship with
her readers, who were forever mailing her packets of seeds,
cuttings from favorite plants, cakes and poems, books and music,
and letters of undying affection.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you'd go on a book signing with her it was excruciating,
because everybody had a scrapbook full of stuff that they knew she
wanted to see, and she did want to see it,'' said Atlanta mystery
writer Kathy Hogan Trocheck, a personal friend. ``And they'd all
have groceries they'd want to give her. Something about her made
people want to smoke a ham.''
</P>
<P>
   An older Atlanta reader will recall a Sibley of a different
sort, a cop shop reporter who reveled in a good juicy homicide. As
her fictional alter ego, Katharine Kincaid, the newswriting
protagonist of her first novel, ``The Malignant Heart,'' summed it
up, ``Murder is my favorite assignment.''
</P>
<P>
   She viewed the capital trial as the modern-day counterpart to
Shakespeare's theater, and she was skilled at sketching its cast of
characters. Covering the 1948 trial that would become the potboiler
``Murder in Coweta County,'' Sibley located the seemingly prescient
fortune-teller, Mayhayley Lancaster, who would lend those
proceedings their supernatural air.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was absolutely the best court reporter I ever saw,'' said
former Constitution editor Bill Shipp. ``She knew how to bring a
trial to life like nobody I've ever seen before or since.''
</P>
<P>
   She was also a workhorse, said Shipp. ``You'd send her on an
assignment, she'd give you 800 or 1,000 words on the trial, she'd
give you a sidebar on the principal lawyers, then she'd sit down
and write a column.''
</P>
<P>
   Said friend and fellow sage of Southern food John Egerton,
``That woman could write a column while I was trying to figure out
how to set the margins on my typewriter.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of her writing career, Sibley also pursued a more
exhausting job, single-handedly rearing and supporting three
children. She had unreliable help from her alcoholic first husband,
Jim Little, whom she loved dearly but who proved an unfit spouse.
He died at age 45.
</P>
<P>
   With financial help from Little often nonexistent, Sibley took
to freelancing true confession stories for pulpy magazines,
ghost-writing autobiographical tales (with titles such as ``I Sold
My Baby for $300'') about the ne'er-do-wells she met on the beat.
</P>
<P>
   Though such contributions embarrassed her full-time employer
(her editors at the Constitution, where she hired on in 1941,
eventually offered to raise her undersized salary as an inducement
to end her low-rent freelancing) Sibley refrained from exploiting
her subjects. Not even the young woman who sold her own baby was
treated poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley, as agreed, traveled to the girl's mountain home, and
read the story out loud to the girl and her wrinkled mother. She
needed their approval before she could market it to the penny
dreadfuls. While she read the somewhat purple prose, the girl began
to weep, and the mother threw her own apron over her head in shame.
Sibley soldiered on. When at last she finished, the older woman
heaved a great sigh and exclaimed, ``I do swear that's might near
the prettiest story I ever heard tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Sibley was also adept at coaxing quotes from career politicians,
which she proved while covering the Legislature from 1958 until
1978. She helped push the legislators toward much humane
legislation, said former U.S. Rep. James Mackay of Decatur. ``She
was one of the key people that said the jailhouse is not where the
drunk can recover,'' he said. ``She is credited by the Legislature
for almost singlehandedly causing the Georgia Clinic to be created.
Because of the pain she's had in her own family, she is keen to
other people's pain.''
</P>
<P>
   While at the Capitol, Sibley was often sought for counsel by
legislators, who, in 1978, passed a resolution praising her for her
coverage and just this month announced that the press gallery in
the Capitol House chamber will be named in her honor. Her friend
Dorothy Nix, an executive with the Garden Club of Georgia, once
brought a battalion of ladies to the Capitol to lobby for a law to
control billboards. Her colleagues were unimpressed with the
state's political leaders, however. ``They just wanted to catch a
glimpse of Celestine Sibley,'' said Nix. ``To me, Celestine Sibley
is the first lady of Georgia no matter who's in the Governor's
Mansion.''
</P>
<P>
   Sibley was one of the newspaper's employees closest to Ralph
McGill, the late editor, publisher and Pulitzer Prize-winning
columnist of the Constitution. He doted on her. ``If there is a
queen of our news shop, it is Sister Sibley,'' he once wrote. ``She
can put words down in a manner to excite envy among the rest of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   In later years, when McGill's desk was somehow shifted to the
Constitution's basement, Sibley rescued the rolltop and had it
placed in her office.
</P>
<P>
   Celestine Broxson Colley was born May 23, 1914, in , Holley,
Fla., near Pensacola. Her father was Henry Colley, her mother
Evelyn Barber of Alford, Fla. Though their union was not a happy
one, Barber and Colley were never legally divorced. Evelyn Barber,
who would later become famous in her daughter's column as ``Muv,''
laughed off suggestions that she was committing bigamy when she
subsequently married Wesley Reeder Sibley, a lumberman in Creola,
Ala., 18 miles north of Mobile. Sibley (who was known as Pap or
Bob) adopted the 7-year-old Celestine as his own.
</P>
<P>
   The young girl grew up among Mobile County's fishermen,
shrimpers and oystermen whom she recalled as ``self-reliant,
independent, masters of the art of make-do.''
</P>
<P>
   But they were people of the Gulf; she was not. ``We were close
in map miles but eons away in time, temperament and mores from the
salt water and even the aristocratic civilization of old Mobile,''
she wrote. ``We were piney woods people who drew our living from
the woods instead of the water.''
</P>
<P>
   At countywide Murphy High in Mobile, Sibley became editor of the
school paper. The Mobile Press-Register called asking whether any
students wanted to work on weekends. She assigned herself, and at
15 began her newspaper career. Her first story was an interview
with a legislator who had introduced a bill to make illegal the
possession and sale of marijuana. She graduated from Murphy High in
1933, and later attended Spring Hill College in Mobile.
</P>
<P>
   She worked as a full-time reporter for the Press-Register in
1933-36, and for the nearby Pensacola News-Journal from 1936 to
1941.

<P>
   (continued)
</P>
<P>
   Sibley married Little, a Press-Register copy editor, and they
took jobs in Atlanta, she with the Constitution, he with the
Associated Press. Little bounced from job to job, in Mobile,
Pensacola, Atlanta, Jacksonville, Atlanta again, Orlando, Atlanta
again, St. Petersburg and Columbus. He stayed in hotels, leaving
Sibley and their children here to live on her newspaper salary and
freelance income from magazine articles and books.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley's life never lacked for melodrama, and occasional real
tragedy. Two of her grandchildren died in infancy, one from SIDS,
the other from a fall. The sadness she knew, and her background of
poverty, gave her a heightened concern for ordinary people that,
more than anything else, made her one of the newspaper's most
popular writers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, she helped convince the state Board of Pardons and
Paroles to free convicted killer Floyd Woodward. A onetime con man
wanted in connection with a 1920 slaying, Woodward had gone
straight for years, living in California under an assumed name,
before he was extradited to Georgia and convicted in 1943. At a
hearing, witnesses testified that Woodward had acted in
self-defense. He was freed and Sibley put him on a plane to
California.
</P>
<P>
   Another of her familiar column subjects was Francis Brunton. He
was a hobo who lived under the Spring Street viaduct and rode
through downtown Atlanta on a bicycle, wearing a globe around his
neck and carrying an encyclopedia. Sibley let him use her office as
a mailing address.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley collected such characters, and her columns were peopled
with a Dickensian gallery of eccentrics and castoffs. Readers will
remember:
</P>
<P>
   _ Miss Anna May Smith, whose house was pulled down by kudzu and
who the police picked up on some minor charge. They reported to
Sibley that they discovered $10,000 sewed into her clothing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mrs. Arizona Bell, who sold papers downtown and had once
ridden in Buffalo Bill's circus. Sibley, in her own subversive way,
chose Mrs. Bell as a partner to accompany her to the Metropolitan
Opera.
</P>
<P>
   _ Miss Peavey, who loved well, but not wisely. Sibley described
one of her elderly suitors as having ``not a tooth in his head, but
the light of love in his eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Ted Hagler and Ronald Rolland, aka Ted and Shorty. Panhandlers
and longtime fixtures of the Marietta Street scene, Ted and Shorty
are among the contemporary street people who also populated the
column. ``She's just the sweetest person you could ever hope to
meet,'' said Hagler, 51.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley was loved by readers for profiling the nonfamous in her
columns, but she knew and wrote about the famous as well. In the
early 1950s, the merged Journal-Constitution sent her on annual
trips to Hollywood to write puff pieces, in her words, promoting
upcoming movies. She earned $100 apiece for the articles, which
were published in the Sunday magazine.
</P>
<P>
   On the set of ``Don't Bother to Knock'' in 1952, Sibley asked
Marilyn Monroe, ``How does it feel to be an international
cheesecake success?''
</P>
<P>
   Monroe replied: ``I just believe in doing the best you can with
what you have.''
</P>
<P>
   She never conferred celebrity on herself, however. When she was
covering the 1976 presidential campaign alongside a visiting
reporter with the University of Georgia's student newspaper, the
Red and Black, she insisted that both journalists be given equal
access. ``I talked to everyone in the Carter family because I was
with her,'' said Patricia Templeton, that student reporter, a
longtime friend, and now an Episcopalian minister, who will preside
at Sibley's funeral service.
</P>
<P>
   Years after her first husband died, she again found love, with
Jack Strong, a real estate broker and former reporter for the
Constitution, who was about 12 years her junior. For more than 40
years, they kept company with each other and finally married in
1987. In November of 1988, at age 59, he died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her heroic productivity, Sibley led a vigorous private
life, full of the enthusiasms that she shared with her readers and
many that she did not, in particular her fondness for gossip. ``She
remembered everything, especially grievances,'' quipped her
long-time editor at Harper and Row, now HarperCollins, Lawrence
Ashmead.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the columns don't reveal about her is that she was a very
intelligent, somewhat cynical, salty-talking reporter,'' said her
friend Robert Steed, a partner in the prestigious law firm King and
Spalding, and a onetime-writer of humorous newspaper columns for
The Atlanta Journal. ``She had another sharper side to her. That
was the fun side, that's why these newspaper people and reprobate
lawyers wanted to be in her company.''
</P>
<P>
   She often used her column to offer tribute to friends and other
notable Georgians who had passed away. Said columnist Jim Minter,
former editor of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution,``I'd hoped she'd
live long enough to write a column about me when I die; she could
make some pretty (lousy) people look pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Sibley would sometimes reprint letters from her readers that
questioned her ability, her taste and intelligence. She would
usually answer these with modest restraint. Occasionally her
forbearance might sag. An Americus woman wrote to berate her for
being ``leftist'' on women's rights, and for not appreciating Elvis
Presley, Anita Bryant or the television show ``Dallas.'' Answered
Sibley, ``Ah, what a lot of twaddle!''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Emerson, former Newsweek bureau chief and a friend, cited
Sibley as ``the best columnist the Atlanta newspapers have ever
had, better than Bill Arp, better than Lewis Grizzard, better than
Ralph McGill. She also knew more about the informal history of
Atlanta than any other living person, including Franklin Garrett.''
</P>
<P>
   She loved the religious drama ``Heaven Bound,'' performed yearly

doctorates, a commendation from the Legislature as ``state
treasure'' and even a piece of Ga. 140 renamed the Celestine Sibley
Highway, where she was once involved in a brush-up with a red
pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley was only the second woman to receive The Lifetime

DISCIPLES OF HATE GROUPS ARE OFTEN `LONE WOLVES' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JO THOMAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, law-enforcement officials
began struggling with a big unanswered question: Were domestic
terrorist attacks by white supremacists, both actual and thwarted,
isolated events or the work of a cohesive underground movement?
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state investigators, including undercover agents,
have painstakingly searched the evidence in a growing list of
bombings, shootings and robberies. But they maintain there is no
evidence of an organized effort among the disparate assortment of
violent right-wing groups and individuals scattered across the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, top-level law-enforcement officials and experts on
terrorism say, what has emerged is a new style of ``leaderless
resistance'' _ long urged by white supremacist leaders _ of very
small cells, pairs or individuals, called lone wolves, acting
independently. Hate groups, often using the Internet, provide the
philosophical framework. Individuals with few or no tangible
connections to these groups do the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Buford O. Furrow Jr., the angry, unemployed white supremacist
who the police say scouted several Jewish institutions before
shooting five people in a Los Angeles Jewish community center last
week, may be the latest example.
</P>
<P>
   The police are not yet saying whether Furrow fancied himself a
lone wolf, part of something larger, or whether, as some suggest,
he was just a deeply disturbed loner susceptible to the influences
of the violent right. But the actions he has admitted to have
focused attention on what law-enforcement officials say is a new
and particularly dangerous tactic of supremacists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've moved into the era of the solo act,'' said Mike
Reynolds, an analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center, a private
nonprofit group based in Montgomery, Ala., that tracks the
activities of hate groups around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The notion being preached in pamphlets, on telephone lines and
on white supremacist Web sites is that of the romantic, heroic
loner who fights his own private war, committing violent acts
against the government, Jews and racial minorities. A warrior
working alone, supremacist leaders say, cannot be betrayed or
infiltrated by the FBI, a fate that has befallen some hate groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good hunting, lone wolves,'' said a telephone message put out
on Aug. 3 by Tom Metzger, the leader of White Aryan Resistance, or
WAR, a white supremacist group based in California.
</P>
<P>
   Metzger was deploring the demise of Proposition 187, a
California referendum barring illegal immigrants from receiving
government services. A federal court found much of the proposition
unconstitutional, and last month Gov. Gray Davis agreed to drop an
appeal of that ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Metzger, in his phone message, said: ``Today, California ceased
to exist as an Aryan-dominated state. WAR releases all associates
from any constraints, real or imagined, in confronting the problem
in any way you see fit.'' He then called for a second civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, of the law center, was among the first to take note
when three white supremacists who had bombed a bank, a newspaper
and an abortion clinic in Spokane, Wash., in 1996 called themselves
Phineas Priests.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that men who feel they are called by God should commit
independent acts of terrorism, in the manner of Phineas, an Old
Testament priest who slew an interreligious couple, was put forward
by Richard Kelly Hoskins, a former member of the American Nazi
Party, in a 1990 book, ``Vigilantes of Christendom.'' But Hoskins
broached the idea in an earlier book, ``War Cycles/Peace Cycles,''
an anti-Semitic treatise found in the van abandoned in Los Angeles
by Furrow.
</P>
<P>
   When Furrow was arrested, he told the FBI he wanted the
shootings at the community center to be ``a wake-up call to America
to kill Jews,'' officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorism experts point out that advances in technology, in
particular the Internet, have fueled the activities of loners,
making it easy for them to communicate and giving them access to
extremist philosophers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts them all in the loop,'' said Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean
and founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which monitors 2,100
hate sites on the Web. ``They feel linked up. They're not alone. It
makes them part of a greater thing. It's their ticket to the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jenkins, an adviser on issues of crime and terrorism to
the president of Rand Corp., a nonpartisan think tank, said an
important consequence of the new technology was the disappearance
of hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of groups modeled after the military, like the Red
Brigades, the ultra-left-wing organization responsible for dozens
of terrorist attacks in the 1970s and '80s, including the
assassination of former Prime Minister Aldo Moro of Italy, ``we've
moved into a realm where we are obliged to speak of universes of
like-minded fanatics,'' Jenkins said, ``from which emerge small
galaxies of conspirators, or in some cases, simply individuals who
mentally incorporate the belief systems, whether it's racism or
anti-Semitism or religious fanaticism, of the broader universe, but
are not receiving orders in any formal sense of the term.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger has increased, Jenkins said, ``because they are
virtually impossible to identify in advance.''

<P>
</P>
<P>
   The worst terrorist act on American soil, the bombing of the
federal building in Oklahoma City, which killed 168 people, was
committed by two people, according to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Found among the belongings of Terry Nichols, who was convicted
in that bombing along with Timothy McVeigh, was a well-thumbed copy
of ``Hunter,'' a novel by William Pierce, the head of the neo-Nazi
National Alliance, who also wrote ``The Turner Diaries,'' which
prosecutors said was a virtual blueprint for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hunter'' dramatized the idea of the solitary white warrior and
was dedicated to Joseph Paul Franklin, a serial killer who shot
interracial couples and also shot and wounded the civil rights
leader Vernon Jordan and the publisher of ``Hustler'' magazine,
Larry Flynt. Franklin, who has admitted to or is suspected in 17
murders, is on death row. His first known attack was the bombing of
a synagogue in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of terrorists operating alone or in pairs became a
major concern to law enforcement after the bombing in Oklahoma
City, particularly in cases in which the attackers had ready access
to weapons or explosives and could operate far outside the
mainstream, without jobs, home addresses, telephone numbers or
credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the FBI and other law-enforcement officials geared
to identifying and thwarting criminal organizations, like the
Mafia, have had far less ability to investigate political groups or
their leaders, whose speeches and writings, while inflammatory, are
constitutionally protected.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way to track these people without a massive
invasion of privacy,'' said Paul Bresson, an FBI spokesman in
Washington. He added, ``Neither the American public nor the FBI
wants that.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal guidelines adopted in the aftermath of abuses committed
in the civil rights and antiwar era bar the FBI from spying on hate
groups or infiltrating them unless they have grounds to suspect
that a group plans to commit a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Within these guidelines, federal agencies have used undercover
agents to thwart a number of attacks planned since the Oklahoma
bombing, offering evidence of how much easier it is to investigate
a group, as opposed to keeping track of individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Arrests have been made in groups of from three to 12 members on
charges of planning to blow up government and other buildings.
Undercover work stopped a plot to bomb the FBI's national
fingerprint records center in West Virginia and another plan, in
1997, to attack an open house at Fort Hood on the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   But recent hate crimes and acts of terror, the experts say,
demonstrate the difficulty of intercepting a lone terrorist and the
devastation that can be wreaked by one or two people.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Matthew Williams, 31, and his brother James Tyler
Williams, 29, arrested in connection with the July 1 shotgun
killings of a gay couple near Redding, Calif., are also suspects,
the police say, in fires that caused nearly $1 million in damage to
three synagogues in Sacramento on June 18.
</P>
<P>
   Another supremacist, Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, 21, who went on a
shooting attack against blacks, Asians and Jews in Illinois and
Indiana over the Fourth of July weekend, killed two people and
injured nine before killing himself.
</P>
<P>
   Another loner, Eric Robert Rudolph, a fugitive who disappeared
into the Carolina woods, is charged with four bombings that left
two people dead, including a police officer, and 124 injured. These
attacks included the bombing at Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta
in 1996, the bombings of an Atlanta abortion clinic and of a
nightclub with a gay clientele in 1997, and the bombing of an
abortion clinic in Birmingham, Ala., last year.
</P>
<P>
   Extensive files from the Internet about Rudolph were found among
the possessions of David Copeland, an engineer who was charged with
three nail-bomb attacks on ethnic minorities and homosexuals in
London in April. Three people were killed and more than 100 were
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Berlet, the president of Political Research Associates, a
company based in Somerville, Mass., that tracks extremist groups,
said the approaching millennium has focused ``a confluence of
demonization, scapegoating and conspiracy theories. For people with
an ideology that is apocalyptic, the struggle between good and evil
is approaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Hate groups in the United States, Berlet said, are grounded in a
narrative in which ``hardy white male middle-class people are being
squeezed by secret elites above who manipulate their lives, while
down below are lazy, shiftless parasites that are picking their
pockets. They feel squeezed from above and below.''
</P>
<P>
   Furrow was for a time associated with the Church of Jesus Christ
Christian/Aryan Nations. The group espouses the Christian Identity
theology, which teaches that people of color were created before
Adam and are, therefore, like beasts of the field, and that Jews
are the product of a union between Eve and Satan.
</P>
<P>
   The language of Christian Identity ``not only demeans minorities
and Jews,'' said Gail Gans, director of the Civil Rights
Information Center of the Anti-Defamation League, ``it sets them up
as targets. When you've erased someone's humanity, it makes them
easier to shoot.''

 &HT;    TOM BAXTER'S COLUMN: Past Iowa straw polls led to straw hopes
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMES, Iowa _ Any discussion of the winners and losers in
Saturday's much ballyhooed Iowa straw poll should begin with a
backward glance at some of those who polled well in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm tied Bob Dole in the 1995 contest and went
swiftly nowhere. In 1987, Pat Robertson soundly beat George Bush
the elder, inspiring hopes that were never realized.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Texas Gov. George W. Bush might not take much
consolation in his first-place finish Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's 31 percent showing, although it was the highest
percentage any candidate has ever received in the poll, couldn't
match the exaggerated expectations created by his prodigious
fund-raising performance.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush was the big winner of the day. He spent less than
magazine publisher Steve Forbes, campaigned only a few days in
Iowa, didn't advertise on television and finished solidly at the
head of the pack. Second-guessers might wonder if he could have
invested a little more and finished off his rivals early, but that
would have been hard to do with the turnout at Ames _ nearly twice
that of four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's supporters were an unobtrusive lot. Both inside and
outside the arena where the event was held, Forbes' supporters were
more in evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes ``spent to win and came in second,'' Bush's spokesTexan,
Karen Hughes, said after the results were announced. For his money,
however, Forbes did well enough to claim success at the end of the
day and push on with his campaign. His strategic priority now is
likely to be winnowing down the field so this becomes a race
between him and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise of the day, simply because so much of the smart
money expected her to fall short, was former Red Cross leader
Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether her third-place finish will be
enough to revive her lagging fund-raising effort, but she
demonstrated her potential to get younger women voters more
involved in the process. She seems much more likely now to go the
distance into next year's primaries.
</P>
<P>
   As Dole was expected to underachieve by many who had watched her
on the stump, Gary Bauer, a leading social conservative activist,
was viewed as the candidate who could pull off a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer did not finish third, as some thought he might, but he
accomplished what was most important to his campaign by finishing
ahead of his rival on the right, Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer had his best fund-raising week of the year leading into
the poll, and he also shows every indication of carrying on into
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan fell way short of his 1995 third-place finish, but he
runs the kind of survivalist campaign that will allow him to take a
setback. The big question is whether he'll reconsider his decision
to continue campaigning as a Republican or jump ship.
</P>
<P>
   About former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and former Vice
President Dan Quayle, who finished sixth and eighth, respectively,
there probably aren't any big questions left. The nominating
process for this election is big money and brutally fast, and it
appears to have left both these contenders behind at the starting
gate.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative talk radio host Alan Keyes and Sen. Orrin Hatch of
Utah didn't have big enough expectations to be much affected by
their showing, and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who at least has
established himself as the true nonconformist in this race, bagged
it altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of big money, save a space in the winners column for
the Iowa GOP, which grossed more than $600,000 for this one-day
event, in addition to putting on quite a show. Now, on to the
Alabama straw poll.

JETS SHOWING WEAKNESS AT QUARTERBACK, BEHIND TESTAVERDE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On what promises to be an even more imaginative and explosive
offense than last year, the Jets may have a weak link: quarterback.
Then again, it may simply be a theoretical problem.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback? Vinny Testaverde looked as good against the Green
Bay Packers in Saturday night's preseason opener as he did in his
best performances of last year's Pro Bowl campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the question still remains _ who is his backup? Although
Testaverde has not missed a game because of injury since 1994, most
quarterbacks are not so lucky. In fact, each of the four teams that
competed in the conference championship games last season lost a
starting quarterback to injury at some point in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Testaverde had nine consecutive completions (his
last pass was dropped) in leading the Jets to a field goal and
touchdown against the Packers before sitting down with the rest of
the first-string offense. He completed 11 of 13 passes for an
imposing 147 yards, including a 26-yard masterpiece to Eric Green
that the tight end caught with one hand in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Then Ray Lucas took over at quarterback, and in nine drives
could put only two field goals on the board against mostly the
Packers' second team as Green Bay won, 27-16, at Lambeau Field.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Lucas sounded crushed, as if he knew he had
blown his chance as the club's No. 2 quarterback with his erratic
performance. He completed fewer than half his attempts (14 of 32)
for 143 yards. Predictably, he was the Jets' leading rusher with 42
yards on 5 carries. His rushing skills are outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott Zolak plays Friday night against the Eagles,'' Lucas
said in assessing his status, ``and then Vinny will get most of the
work the final two games to get ready for the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Zolak is the former Patriots' backup who came to the Jets as a
free agent.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets seemed to have ended last season with a competent
backup quarterback in Glenn Foley. He had started the season as the
first-string quarterback, but then got injured and had played
inconsistently and Testaverde wound up having what he describes as
``my magical season.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, though, reiterated Sunday why Foley no longer is a
Jet: ``I had to trade him _ I can't afford two guys at these
prices. All the teams are doing that.'' Thus, when Foley refused to
renegotiate the multimillion dollar contract he had signed as a
starter, he was traded to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Parcells always was worried about how fragile Foley
was physically, and in the second game of the season, Foley
severely bruised his ribs.
</P>
<P>
   By trading Foley, however, what the Jets may have lost in a
known backup they gained in other areas, in part by having the
money to acquire Green and several other high-priced free agents.
It has been a trade-off that, so far, has worked in the Jets'
favor.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas did not have the luxury of a first-string line and
first-string receivers for most of his appearance, but neither will
Zolak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem you have when you have so many young guys going in
late in the first half is that there's too many things that can go
wrong,'' Parcells said. ``It makes it more difficult to evaluate
the players as individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he will not make it easier for Zolak because, Parcells
said: ``I just can't do that. There are so many players and I have
to look at them. I don't have the luxury to blend these guys. I
can't afford not to play these guys as a group.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Lucas, Parcells said: ``I thought he was a little jumpy
in the pocket, but the protection wasn't good enough for him to
hold the way we want. I think there has to be more consistency
there. I don't really view this player at this position as an
experienced player, but I think he needs to show he has to be more
consistent.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells also, however, cited good performances by four of his
draft picks: guard Randy Thomas, defensive tackle Jason Wiltz,
tackle Ryan Young and linebacker J.J. Syvrud.
</P>
<P>
   The coach was not that happy with his first-team defense, which
yielded a touchdown on the Packers' opening drive.
</P>
<P>
   But the quarterback search continues and it is between two
players, for now. Punter Tom Tupa, Parcells said, will not be
competing for the backup role. For all anyone knows, the backup
might end up being a player who isn't currently a Jet.

TWINS TURN BACK YANKS AS FANS LOOK FORWARD TO STRAWBERRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ricky Ledee heard voices Sunday at Yankee Stadium,
during the Yankees' 5-3 loss to Minnesota. Ledee tried ignoring the
voices, but they persisted, making an eerie sound familiar to Ledee
and just about every other New York baseball fan.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl, the voices called to Ledee, from the stands. Darryl.
</P>
<P>
   Slugger Darryl Strawberry is expected to join the Yankees soon _
maybe within 10 days, maybe two weeks, maybe after Sept. 1 _ and
create a dilemma for the manager Joe Torre, who has seen Ledee
slowly develop into a confident contributor in the last six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees didn't have enough contributions Sunday, all the way
around. They didn't have enough scoring chances against Minnesota's
Brad Radke, the right-hander who scattered nine hits over 7 2/3
innings. The Yankees didn't have enough efficiency from Hideki
Irabu, who had difficulty finishing off hitters with two strikes
and lost a decision for the first time since May 25.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins jumped ahead, 5-1, against Irabu _ five of their nine
hits came with two strikes _ and in the next three innings, the
Yankees threatened. Scott Brosius struck out with runners at second
and third and two out in the seventh, missing one of Radke's
changeups, and the Yankees didn't score in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees did score a run in the next inning and had the
potential tying run at the plate in Chili Davis, who came into the
at-bat ranked first in the majors when hitting the first pitch,
with a .508 batting average. Eddie Guardado, the Minnesota
reliever, threw a first-pitch fastball, Davis blasted it, and the
56,180 fans who packed Yankee Stadium on a Beanie Baby day roared.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis' fly died on the warning track, in center field. Then,
in the ninth, the Yankees pieced together another run and had first
and second and two out, before Paul O'Neill hit into a game-ending
fielder's choice. The Yankees are 71-45, still far ahead of Toronto
and Boston in the American League East and seemingly destined for
the playoffs. ``I like the way we're playing right now,'' said
Torre, speaking generally.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' standing will provide Torre with a margin for error
as he integrates Strawberry into his roster before the postseason
begins. George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, has
demonstrated a personal interest in Strawberry's comeback, so the
question is not whether Strawberry will rejoin the Yankees; it is
when. ``George is driving this train,'' one member of the
organization said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Sunday's game, Strawberry, suspended and then
reinstated following his no contest plea on possession of cocaine
and solicitation charges, is batting .263 with no home runs and
three RBIs in 11 games, numbers that are hardly inspiring. By all
accounts, however, he is swinging the bat well, and moving in the
outfield and bases far better than anyone expected.
</P>
<P>
   Word in the Yankees' organization is that there have been games
when Strawberry's intensity has waned _ particularly in a game
played in Toledo recently _ but Torre shrugged that off Sunday.
Strawberry wants to be in the big leagues, Torre said, and once
Strawberry rejoins the big leagues, he'll be fine.
</P>
<P>
   And then Torre will figure out how to get Strawberry enough
playing time to keep his swing honed, and simultaneously, to
maintain Ledee's performance and confidence. Chili Davis is the
Yankees' full-time designated hitter _ although Jim Leyritz may
play against some lefties _ so Strawberry will get much of his
playing time in left field, probably at Ledee's expense.
</P>
<P>
   Including his single and two walks Sunday, Ledee is batting .364
since being called up June 26, including eight hits in 16 at-bats
(.500) with runners in scoring position. ``He's been playing well,
playing good defense, swinging the bat well,'' said Derek Jeter,
the Yankees' shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Said Jorge Posada, the Yankees' catcher: ``He's getting some
playing time and that helps. He knows when there is a right-hander
on the mound, he's going to play.''
</P>
<P>
   That won't necessarily be the case, of course, once Strawberry
arrives. Ledee will get a share of the playing time, and there
likely will be some games when Strawberry starts, gets two or three
or four plate appearances, before giving way to Ledee or Chad
Curtis in the late innings.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee knows this. He hears the voices. ``It doesn't concern
me,'' said Ledee. ``They love Darryl here, and we love him, too.
Darryl's talked to me about a lot of things, because he's had a lot
of scars, and I really appreciated it. I'm going to keep doing my
job. Whatever happens, it's not my decision. I can't help it. If it
happens, it happens.''

MCLAREN-MERCEDES TEAM FIRST AND SECOND IN HUNGARIAN GRAND PRIX
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BRAD SPURGEON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST, Hungary _ The McLaren-Mercedes team did exactly what
it had to do Sunday to pull itself out of a two-race slump and keep
its world title hopes alive, as its two cars came in first and
second at the Hungarian Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
   Mika Hakkinen led from start to finish in a largely uneventful
but textbook-perfect race, covering the 77 laps around the
3.973-kilometer (2.4-mile) track in 1 hour 46 minutes 23.536
seconds, for an average speed of 172.524 kilometers per hour (107
miles per hour).
</P>
<P>
   His teammate David Coulthard was 9.7 seconds behind, followed by
Eddie Irvine 27.2 seconds back in a Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a while,'' said Hakkinen, who had not won a race
since the Canadian Grand Prix in June. ``When I was driving, I was
thinking this is the time if something will go wrong, it will go
wrong. Everything went perfectly. There was no problem with the
car.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Hakkinen's 13th career victory, his fourth this season,
and his first in Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   Hakkinen, with 54 points, is now 2 points behind the first-place
Irvine in the championship standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was struggling with the rear of the car and struggling with
the front of the car,'' said Irvine, who won the previous two
races. ``We were just hanging on by the skin of our teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a disappointment,'' he said. ``The last two weekends were
good weekends and this one was a bad weekend. Maybe the next
weekend will be a good one and I will be smiling again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hakkinen, 30, a Finn, started from the pole position before a
sellout crowd under hot and cloudy skies and with strong winds.
</P>
<P>
   He got off to a good start, while Irvine had to battle with
Giancarlo Fisichella in a Benetton to maintain second place as the
Italian drew up beside him down the straight after starting in
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Irvine got through Turn 1 in front, but by the end of the first
lap Hakkinen was 1.3 seconds ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Hakkinen built his lead steadily to 9.2 seconds after the first
17 laps, when he started to encounter the first of the
back-markers.
</P>
<P>
   But he never had a problem overtaking anyone and the outcome of
the race was decided mostly on the superiority of the McLaren car.
It enabled the team to work with less pressure during the two pit
stops, during which they out-performed Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
   Irvine was 17.2 seconds behind Hakkinen and Coulthard was
following close behind Irvine on Lap 40. By the end of Lap 44,
Coulthard was up to 1.3 seconds from the Irishman and closing in on
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to stay as close as possible in order to put the
pressure on him so he could make a mistake,'' Coulthard said.
</P>
<P>
   Coulthard's wish came true after a simultaneous pit stop between
the two teams, which was perhaps the high point of the race, on Lap
58. Whoever worked faster would come out first.
</P>
<P>
   But when both teams performed in 6 seconds, it was Irvine who
maintained the lead, since his pit-stop area is farther down the
pit lane than Coulthard's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pushed like hell for the first half of the lap,'' Irvine
said. ``And while I was pushing hard, I lost the rear into corner
five and just slid wide and came back on.''
</P>
<P>
   Coulthard took second place and never let go. It was the first
McLaren first- and second-place finish since the Spanish Grand Prix
in May.

 &HT;    EDITOR'S NOTE: Sibley's first column appeared in The Atlanta

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There you stand in the hall, backed up out of
traffic's way against the uncompromising contours of a radiator,
your eyes fixed on a swinging green door, your nose breathing in
the sweetish, sickening fumes of ether.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly there is a piercing scream back of the green door and
you clutch the sleeve of a nurse who is rustling by, and cry
accusingly: ``Why is he screaming? I thought it didn't hurt! I
thought they put him to sleep!''
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't time to talk, but her eyes above the white gauze mask
are sympathetic. ``He's all right,'' she says. ``They always cry
out when they are going to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   You subside against the radiator again and try to think of
mothers who have sons on battlefronts, torn and bleeding with maybe
no real hospital near and no white-coated doctors and nurses and
anesthetists to make things easier for them. You think maybe you're
thirsty and you walk to the water cooler and then back to the room.
Twenty-seven steps it is. Maybe if you take 'em slow, and smile,
and speak to people on the way, that'll use up another minute and
leave only about 17 or 18 _ unless there are complications ...
</P>
<P>
   The thought sends you scurrying back to your post against the
radiator. Complications. Your hands are cold and damp. Your shoes
squeak loudly when you move. A woman doctor passes, stethoscope
swinging from her neck, and smiles at you, imperturbably cheerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard, waiting,'' she says, and striving for a calm,
unconcerned expression, your eye lights on the comic book he left
in your safekeeping. A precious, new, unread comic book, presented
by a neighbor who pointed out that it was something new in comics,
all about Robin Hood and therefore wholesome and educational.
</P>
<P>
   You turn a few pages and there in blood-red and eerie, midnight
blue is a poor cringing creature begging: ``No, No! Not the
branding iron!'' You shudder, and turn on, and there's the intrepid
Robin Hood crouched on his hands and knees with these words coming
balloonlike out of his mouth: ``But you were not invited to buffet
me. I'll break you in twain.''
</P>
<P>
   That'll take some translating into modern Superman-ese, you
fear, and you put the comic book on the radiator and return your
attention to the swinging green door. It creaked a second ago.
Maybe they're coming out. You study the door fixedly for
interminable seconds, but it was a false alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall in the sun parlor a man is saying, ``Which way is
town from here? You mean that was all of town we saw last night
coming here? Why, I drove through it without any trouble at all.
Atlanta must not be much bigger than Albany.''
</P>
<P>
   You smile at the note of pleased civic pride and go gulp down
some water. Twenty-seven steps there and back ... twenty or thirty
minutes it'd take, they said. Twenty or 30 minutes .. No, No! Not
the branding iron! Complications .. How big is Albany? Not a
serious operation .. 17, 16, 15 steps.
</P>
<P>
   This time the door is opening and you take the remaining steps
in two bounds. Yes, they are bringing him out _ a colored attendant
and a white gowned nurse lugging his limp, 5-year-old body between
them. Behind them you get a glimpse of the forest of sinister
gleaming instruments you sent your child into, alone and
unprotected. A nurse is wheeling a scary-looking machine away and
saying something over her shoulder to another nurse. You strain to
hear the words and as the door swings shut, you catch them: ``Two
pairs of nylons, my dear.''
</P>
<P>
   You scurry after your child, but are met at the door with polite
but firm resistance. He's all right _ but you'd better stay out of
the room a while. Go sit in the sun parlor. I'll call you.
</P>
<P>
   You remember the book your red-headed neighbor around the corner
brought you as you left for the hospital and you disconsolately
pick it up. Ben Ames Williams' new ``Leave Her to Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about a bad woman,'' the donor remarked with gentle
malice. ``It ought to cheer you up.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it doesn't look cheerful, but you tackle it manfully until
after the first couple of paragraphs you find your gaze keeps
wandering from the printed page and off down the hall. You put the
book aside and study a woman in a gray silk dress who is leaning
against the radiator down there across from the operating room. She
keeps staring at the door and then you realize she is the woman who
came up on the elevator with you. Had a little boy by the hand _
cute but not as husky looking as yours. You pick up the book and
start walking toward her, balancing yourself carefully to keep your
shoes from squeaking.
</P>
<P>
   You smile cheerfully and say heartily: ``Hard waiting, isn't
it?''
</P>
<P>
   She gives you a distracted look and nods dumbly. You search your
mind for more comforting conversation, but just then the door to
your child's room opens and the nurse is beckoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's awake and asking for his mommy,'' she says. ``And we
haven't been sick a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Who hasn't been sick, you feel like retorting grimly, as you
gallop down the hall, but you remember to smile at that poor,
harassed creature back there by the radiator and to say gaily over
the squeak of your shoes:
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry! It's a very simple operation. They have thousands
of them every summer _ in fact, July is really Tonsillectomy Time
in Georgia!''
</P>
<P>
   You don't know if she appreciated it or not, but you figure that
was a pretty neat alliteration you flung at that woman. All the
same, you decide as you observe our child's weak smile and ease
your shoes off under his bed, you can both be glad you were just
waiting for your son to have tonsils out. Think how much worse
it'll be 15 or 20 years from now when your daughters have babies.

   This time the door is opening and you take the remaining steps
in two bounds. Yes, they are bringing him out _ a colored attendant
and a white gowned nurse lugging his limp, 5-year-old body between
them. Behind them you get a glimpse of the forest of sinister
gleaming instruments you sent your child into, alone and
unprotected. A nurse is wheeling a scary-looking machine away and
saying something over her shoulder to another nurse. You strain to
hear the words and as the door swings shut, you catch them: ``Two
pairs of nylons, my dear.''
</P>
<P>
   You scurry after your child, but are met at the door with polite
but firm resistance. He's all right _ but you'd better stay out of
the room a while. Go sit in the sun parlor. I'll call you.
</P>
<P>
   You remember the book your red-headed neighbor around the corner
brought you as you left for the hospital and you disconsolately
pick it up. Ben Ames Williams' new ``Leave Her to Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about a bad woman,'' the donor remarked with gentle
malice. ``It ought to cheer you up.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it doesn't look cheerful, but you tackle it manfully until
after the first couple of paragraphs you find your gaze keeps
wandering from the printed page and off down the hall. You put the
book aside and study a woman in a gray silk dress who is leaning
against the radiator down there across from the operating room. She
keeps staring at the door and then you realize she is the woman who
came up on the elevator with you. Had a little boy by the hand _
cute but not as husky looking as yours. You pick up the book and
start walking toward her, balancing yourself carefully to keep your
shoes from squeaking.
</P>
<P>
   You smile cheerfully and say heartily: ``Hard waiting, isn't
it?''
</P>
<P>
   She gives you a distracted look and nods dumbly. You search your
mind for more comforting conversation, but just then the door to
your child's room opens and the nurse is beckoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's awake and asking for his mommy,'' she says. ``And we
haven't been sick a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Who hasn't been sick, you feel like retorting grimly, as you
gallop down the hall, but you remember to smile at that poor,
harassed creature back there by the radiator and to say gaily over
the squeak of your shoes:
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry! It's a very simple operation. They have thousands
of them every summer _ in fact, July is really Tonsillectomy Time
in Georgia!''
</P>
<P>
   You don't know if she appreciated it or not, but you figure that
was a pretty neat alliteration you flung at that woman. All the
same, you decide as you observe our child's weak smile and ease
your shoes off under his bed, you can both be glad you were just
waiting for your son to have tonsils out. Think how much worse
it'll be 15 or 20 years from now when your daughters have babies.

   NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. _ President Clinton, his wife, his daughter
and his mother-in-law piled into the family Air Force C-20 Sunday
morning and went house-hunting in Westchester County, where they
made five stops and paused to schmooze with some of their
prospective neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton prepares to leave public life and Hillary Rodham
Clinton gears up for an effort to join it, the family swept through
the wealthy New York City suburbs with about as much casualness as
one can muster when accompanied by a black sedan, two sport-utility
vehicles, three police cruisers and four mini-vans.
</P>
<P>
   They even stopped for (most) stop signs.
</P>
<P>
   Two aides trundled off the plane with heavy coolers, apparently
packed to ensure that the Clintons could concentrate on the task at
hand instead of having to search for a drive-through. And they were
pretty diligent: The first family had planned to stay for less than
four hours, but wound up riding around for more than six.
</P>
<P>
   They announced no decision. Aides have said the president and
Mrs. Clinton definitely plan to move to Westchester, although they
may rent instead of buying. The couple were accompanied by Chelsea
and Mrs. Clinton's mother, Dorothy Rodham, for a trip that was
labeled ``private time'' by the White House, but which was taken at
government expense.
</P>
<P>
   Before the White House, the Clintons had been living in the
Governor's Mansion in Arkansas, and have no home to return to when
he leaves office in 2001. And if Mrs. Clinton is to run for senate
next year, she must establish a residence in New York by election
day.
</P>
<P>
   At one stop, according to witnesses, Clinton wandered out the
kitchen door to kibbitz with friends of the homeowner.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in Manhattan or the Hamptons, where such an exercise
might be greeted with pointed indifference, crowds waited for hours
outside two of the houses, and several curious people made U-turns
to see what the commotion was about. While many people complained
about the intrusion, they still stood and gawked.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest throng gathered outside a four-story house that is
swathed in pale-pink stucco and shaded by a weeping-willow tree,
with a marble foyer and a pool out back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill's in there checking the kitchen, maybe flushing a toilet,
looking for leaks,'' said Steven M. Green, 55, a hand surgeon who
lives a block away.
</P>
<P>
   A baby shower across the street broke up as the revelers spilled
outside, where they were greeted by Secret Service agents wielding
magnetic wands. The honoree, Suzanne Stauffer, 35, said gamely,
``This was supposed to be a surprise shower, and I'm sure
surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   The excursion took the Clintons down winding roads loaded with
country clubs and tree-shrouded estates with fountains in front.
Even though the houses were mostly seven-figure offerings on
private roads or behind iron gates, several homeowners said they
believed the first family would improve property values if they
moved in.
</P>
<P>
   The first family finished the day in Edgemont, at a $1.7 million
hilltop house on a corkscrew of a major street known to locals as
``Suicide Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   A local resident, Jon Cramer, 44, said he doubted that Mrs.
Clinton would prevail if she decides to run for the Senate, where
she most likely would face New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she'll move in, lose the election, move out and leave
the imprimatur on the neighborhood,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Mitchell, who lives two blocks from the Edgemont house,
was one of many who said they believed the hoopla would die down in
a hurry. ``We have a number of celebrities around here _ I'm
constantly bumping into David Hartman,'' she said. ``After a
fashion, it would become everyday.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Plenty of people fretted about the traffic, but Anna Dekker, 47,
said, ``I don't think I'm going to run into them in C-Town,''
referring to a local grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Glassman, 27, a computer consultant who lives near the
Edgemont house and was wearing a T-shirt from the Black Dog on
Martha's Vineyard _ where the Clintons have vacationed _ said he
saw political overtones to the search. ``They want to look like
they're doing what the average Joe would do,'' he said. ``It is
kind of cool.''
</P>
<P>
   The first stop was in the village of Rye Brook, where the
Clintons disappeared down a long drive at a house labeled
``Brokenwood.'' A house with a swing set is next door, modest
split-levels across the street. A woman in a black Mercedes station
wagon rolled down her window and asked what was up. When reporters
and aides hesitated briefly, she said with irritation, ``I live
right here. What's going on?'' No one said a word, but suddenly a
light dawned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't tell me,'' she said, looking stricken. ``President
Clinton! Come on! Oh, come on.'' She zoomed away.
</P>
<P>
   Next up was Pound Ridge, which was remote enough to make
cellular-phone use problematic for the Clintons' entourage. Their
third stop was at a home in Mamaroneck, but reporters were
prevented from seeing the house.
</P>
<P>
   After that, they headed for New Rochelle. William O'Shaughnessy,
a local broadcast executive, said the interior of the house they
saw is heavy on velvet and velour. ``In Arkansas, this is a
mansion,'' he said. ``Here, it's a substantial manor house.''
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor, Myrna Root, who has been inside many times,
described the architectural style as ``Mediterranean, with a hint
of Tudor.''
</P>
<P>
   An owner of the house, Vic Vuksanaj, said the Clintons ``liked
everything they saw. They haven't decided anything yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the traffic jam, Phil Papa, 33, said, ``This is a
reality check about what would happen if you had a former president
in your neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   But the objections seemed to melt when, in their only contact
with the public Sunday, the president and Mrs. Clinton came outside
and signed autographs for neighbors, who had been corralled behind
a candy-striped rope. Clinton wore a yellow Oxford shirt, a blue
blazer, brown slacks and brown shoes, while Mrs. Clinton had on a
dark suit. Mrs. Clinton accepted a kiss from a man in the crowd who
said she would be a great senator.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea Clinton had ducked into the silver Suburban with five
antennas that was ferrying the family. The crowd cheered for her
and, as if answering a curtain call, she emerged and grinned as she
shook hands. Clinton patted his daughter on the back, and rubbed
his wife's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Burrell, 38, said she would love to have Mrs. Clinton as
a neighbor. ``She seems very normal,'' Ms. Burrell said as the
motorcade fired its engines. ``Very normal.''

NATO PEACEKEEPERS PLAN SYSTEM TO CONTROL MEDIA IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-RDP) 
(mk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ The United States and its allies
charged with peacekeeping in Kosovo are establishing a system to
control the news media in the province that would write a code of
conduct for journalists, monitor their compliance with it and
establish enforcement mechanisms to punish those who violate its
rules.
</P>
<P>
   A draft plan of operation for Kosovo's Department of Media
Affairs, which already has been established, was drawn up earlier
this month by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, calling for a staff of 50 people.
</P>
<P>
   It has been circulating on a restricted basis to member
countries, who have been asked to nominate suitable personnel. A
copy was provided to The New York Times by someone disturbed by the
contents. International news media groups also have heard about it
and already have expressed criticism.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Western official involved with the plan, who spoke on
the telephone from Kosovo, said it was based on a similar program
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The proposed ``Media Regulatory Commission''
and ``Media Monitoring Division'' are not intended to intimidate or
to censor the local news media but to support and tutor them in the
ways of a Western free press, he said, until they can operate on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is not to censor anyone,'' he said. ``The idea is to
bring people up to Western standards, so you need to present
Western standards to observe. And it will all be done in
consultation.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, the department is charged with
preventing ``the abuse of the media, especially radio and
television, so it can't be used to urge people to go out in the
streets and create riots.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Montenegro and Serbia, which together make up Yugoslavia,
Clinton administration officials are actively engaged in supporting
politicians and news media outlets opposed to the continued rule of
the elected Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic. In Serbia they
are helping the opposition to organize large street demonstrations
intended to press Milosevic to resign.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is
charged by the United Nations, which is in overall control of
Kosovo, with the ``democratization'' of the province, including
running free and fair elections. News media development is a
crucial part of the organization's task, the officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Media Affairs Department, situated in Pristina, the
province's capital, is most urgently charged with allocating
frequencies and issuing broadcasting licenses for Kosovo. Various
businessmen, publishers and potential politicians are already
drawing up plans for new television and radio ventures for the
province.
</P>
<P>
   The department proposes to create a Media Regulatory Commission,
in part based on America's Federal Regulatory Commission, which
governs the airwaves. But the commission would also write (in vague
consultation with Kosovo journalists) and administer a
``broadcasting code of practice'' and ``a temporary press code''
for print journalists, and then ``monitor compliance and establish
enforcement mechanisms,'' the plan says.
</P>
<P>
   As in Bosnia, the commission would have the right to censor
material, to fine stations or to order certain journalists or
stations off the air.
</P>
<P>
   A ``media monitoring division'' would follow the content of
local journalism, report on compliance with the codes of conduct
and ``track the treatment of journalists to insure freedom of
expression and movement as well as responsible behavior by
journalists.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for the appointment by the United Nations of an
``international appellate body,'' to which local news media could
appeal decisions or rulings by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   There would also be an ``independent media council'' of local
journalists and civic leaders, also appointed by the United
Nations, to ``advise'' the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The department also plans to name new management for Radio
Television Pristina, the former Yugoslav state television and radio
outlet in Kosovo, and to turn it into ``a public-service
broadcaster,'' with programming in Albanian and Serbo-Croatian.
When it was run from Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, it also used
to broadcast in Turkish.
</P>
<P>
   ``This arrangement,'' the draft plan says, ``will also assist''
the U.N. mission in Kosovo ``in its urgent need to communicate
directly with the population on matters vital to civil
administration.'' Eventually, the station, along with the Media
Regulatory Commission and all its powers, would be handed over ``to
duly constituted Kosovar authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the plan, the Media Department will also take
responsibility for coordinating international donors to the news
media, including private or nongovernmental agencies, while making
recommendations of media outlets worth sponsoring. It would also
work to develop a nonpartisan news agency for the province and to
establish a journalism school.
</P>
<P>
   Media watchdog groups are critical of the plan. Marilyn Greene,
the executive director of the World Press Freedom Committee, a
group largely financed by American publishers and the Newspaper
Guild, said: ``The infringement of press freedom is obvious.
Unfortunately, the lessons of Bosnia _how not to operate a
reconstruction program _ were apparently not learned.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bosnia was an extremely difficult case, said the Committee's
European representative, Ronald Koven. ``But hard cases make bad
laws,'' and journalists are bound to feel pressure ``to adopt
certain kinds of codes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a kind of colonialist mentality,'' Koven said.
``Foreigners are going to impose their standards and codes of
conduct on independent media journalists in Kosovo in a situation
where before the war there was a perfectly adequate independent
Albanian-language press that knew what it was all about.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited a forthcoming study of foreign media management in
Bosnia by professor Monroe Price of Cardozo Law School, Yeshiva
University, who wrote, ``The time to intervene or control
propaganda is when brutality is imminent,'' not to protect the
political environment afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line between information intervention and censorship
becomes blurred,'' Price wrote. ``One of the great dangers of
international action to restrict free speech is that it provides
apparent democratic justification for any nation to use its police
power to close down media outlets.''

WELFARE CARDS GIVE BANKS SOME CONTROL OF POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: A longer version of this story will be sent by 9 p.m. ET.) 
(lb) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A few months ago, seemingly with good intentions, the
state of New York gave a new electronic banking card to Margarita
O., an 18-year-old from Mexico and the mother of a baby boy. It is
an unusual debit card. On the front is a picture of her smiling
shyly. The familiar black magnetic stripe on the back gives her
access not to a checking account but to $448 a month in government
food credits and cash.
</P>
<P>
   The card held much promise. She would have the same access
everyone else had to all those automatic teller machines. No more
waiting in lines at check-cashing stores. No more demeaning food
stamps. And just a short walk from her rented room in East Harlem
waited Banco Popular, a cheery neighborhood bank with two gleaming
ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, her card is useless at Banco Popular. In fact, it
has not been accepted at most ATMs in East Harlem and throughout
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Out of frustration, Margarita O., who asked that her last name
not be used, because she is an illegal immigrant, simply walks up
the street to the same check-cashing store where she used to get
her benefits free.
</P>
<P>
   Only now she pays up to $2.35 for each withdrawal _ $1.50 to the
store and 85 cents to Citigroup, the financial conglomerate hired
by the state to distribute welfare benefits through ATM cards. That
money, she has come to realize, is being deducted from the welfare
benefits of her son, who was born in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand,'' she said, ``why they are taking away
money from my child.''
</P>
<P>
   She is enduring the unintended consequences of a sweeping
transformation in the way the nation's poorest citizens receive
cash and food credits from the government. In the last few years,
39 states and the District of Columbia have hired corporations to
distribute welfare benefits through the nation's vast web of ATMs
and grocery-store debit machines.
</P>
<P>
   The states hoped to reduce fraud, save money and draw poor
people into the financial mainstream. They wanted to encourage
better money habits and to provide convenience and simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   But the emerging system has pitted profits against service in a
way that has created new vulnerabilities for millions of welfare
recipients across the country.
</P>
<P>
   They are assessed ATM fees that regular customers do not have to
pay _ fees that are deducted from their welfare benefits. The
number of free withdrawals is severely limited, sometimes to two a
month. Balance inquiries at ATMs are forbidden in many states,
including New York. By the thousands, welfare recipients have
learned at the cash register that their cards often do not work
across state lines.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding over most of this system is Citigroup, the parent of
Citibank and the nation's largest financial-services company. About
12 million Americans in 29 states, including New York, now get
welfare with Citigroup ATM cards. At the end of 1998, Citigroup was
distributing $640 million in welfare benefits each month.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup's dominance is growing. As welfare rolls shrink,
competitors have backed off because there is far less money to be
made. This has strengthened Citigroup's position as it pursues new
contracts and, once it wins contracts, in deciding how welfare
money is delivered.
</P>
<P>
   New York vividly illustrates how the states, by handing off the
cumbersome and politically sensitive task of providing aid to the
poor, have given broad new control over welfare policy to private
corporations, primarily Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   For months, as Citigroup has struggled for profits in the
welfare business, the company did not provide hundreds of thousands
of New York City welfare recipients with access to 23,000 ATMs in
the NYCE network and 40,000 ATMs in the MAC network, the two
largest in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, which will be paid about $80 million by the state
over the next four years to distribute benefits, blocked access by
refusing to pay the full fee charged by other banks for each
transaction. Payment of the full fee would have allowed poor people
to use the same range of ATMs as Citigroup's regular customers.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews over several weeks, Citigroup officials defended
their decision, saying New York City's poor had adequate access to
cash. State welfare officials, while expressing disappointment,
said their contract with the bank gave them little power to tell
Citigroup what to do. ``I really don't have any authority at all to
direct them one way or another,'' said Brian Wing, the state's
commissioner of temporary and disability assistance.
</P>
<P>
   And yet this situation is just as Wing and other welfare
officials planned it. Despite warnings from one state justice who
reviewed the contract, state officials willingly embraced an
ambiguous contract that gave Citigroup a free hand to decide how
New York's poor get access to their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, Citigroup's control was again on display.
After being informed that this article was imminent, Citigroup
officials abruptly announced that starting next month they would
allow access to the NYCE network, though not the MAC network.
</P>
<P>
   They also said they would install 25 ATMs in poor neighborhoods
and embark on an educational program. The measures will cost
Citigroup nearly $2 million this year, the officials said. ``We
succeed when the program succeeds,'' said Brian Claire, senior
director for welfare ATM cards at Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   Claire said Citigroup delivers welfare at a saving to taxpayers,
and with greater convenience. ``We have a great track record,'' he
said. Likewise, he dismissed concerns that Citigroup exerts undue
control over the welfare system, saying, ``The states will dictate
what services they require.''

   DIABETES (Seattle) _ Kathleen Kuechenmeister was only 8 years
old when she learned she had diabetes. Now, nearly four decades
later, diabetes is slowly eroding her health. It's destroyed her
kidneys, clouded her eyesight, and damaged nerves throughout her
extremities, making it difficult to walk. But Kuechenmeister, and
266,000 others like her in Washington, have new hope for a cure for
Type 1 diabetes, a debilitating, chronic illness that kills one
American every three minutes. This fall, a consortium of Seattle
institutions plans to resurrect an old idea _ transplanting islet
cells from a donor pancreas into diabetic patients to free them
from a lifetime of insulin injections.

and went to police to try to press charges. Police said they'd
refer the case to prosecutors the next day. They never did. Weeks
later, McGuffey approached Shelley in her car as she drove up to

allows Shelley's mother to sue the city of Anacortes, Wash., for

REYNOLDS METALS REJECTS ALCOA'S $5.8 BILLION BID AS INADEQUATE 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a special meeting Sunday, the board of the Reynolds Metals
Co. said a $5.8 billion half-cash, half-stock takeover offer by
Alcoa Inc. was inadequate and that Reynolds should explore all
alternatives, including putting itself up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was the first time that Reynolds, which has been
under pressure from shareholder groups to sell itself, had said it
would consider that move.
</P>
<P>
   The statement did not mention a letter the company, based in
Richmond, received Thursday from McCook Metals, which is owned by
the Chicago investment firm Michigan Avenue Partners, saying that
it wanted to buy the company.
</P>
<P>
   But Reynolds would have had a hard time responding to that
letter because McCook, which is led by Michael W. Lynch, who is
also head of Michigan Avenue, did not specify a price. It said only
that McCook would pay more than Alcoa, which has bid $65 a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view this as an astute move by the board to remain
independent of Alcoa,'' Lynch said in a telephone interview Sunday,
though he did not clarify McCook's sources of financing. But he
said McCook had financing in place in the event of a successful
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   It was also unclear how McCook would run Reynolds should the
company come up with a winning bid. Despite investors' objections,
the current Reynolds management is said to want to remain in place.
A person close to McCook, however, said the company was more likely
to offer those managers big severance packages instead of retaining
them.
</P>
<P>
   A person close to Alcoa, which is based in Pittsburgh, said that
there was nothing in the Reynolds statement ``that surprises me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was hard for Reynolds, which is being advised by Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co., to avoid putting itself up for sale. Shareholders
unhappy with management met in New York last month to discuss their
dissatisfaction with the company. They complained that Jeremiah
Sheehan, the Reynolds chairman and chief executive, was not
actively seeking a buyer.
</P>
<P>
   McCook has sought to become a significant presence in aluminum
since it bought a fabricating plant in McCook, Ill., in 1997.
Earlier this year, it acquired an aluminum rolling mill in
Scottsboro, Ala., but lost out in the bidding for some smelting
operations of the Columbia Falls Aluminum Co. in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Grubman, a partner in Highfields Capital Management,
which owns 4.3 million shares, or 6.7 percent, of Reynolds, said
that if the Reynolds board wanted to sell the company, it should
name a special committee to handle an auction.
</P>
<P>
   As an investor, Grubman said, he was still somewhat skeptical of
management's intentions because in March the company rejected an
earlier bid from Alcoa without disclosing it. ``A special committee
such as that would have one real task: to sell the company,''
Grubman said.
</P>
<P>
   There was some chance a third bidder might surface. There have
been rumors that Rechiney SA of France, Alusuisse Lonza Group AG of
Switzerland and Alcan Aluminium of Canada, which are in a three-way
merger, might make an offer.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, shares of Reynolds rose $3, to $69.375, while those
of Alcoa fell $1.25, to $66.50.

GATTI AND JOHNSTON SAVOR THEIR VICTORIES, PAINFULLY 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arturo Gatti made a successful comeback and Stevie Johnston
retained his World Boxing Council lightweight title at the Foxwoods
Resort Casino in Connecticut on Saturday night. Both accomplished
their goals, but it cost them.
</P>
<P>
   Gatti was too distraught to enjoy his victory _ a first-round
technical knockout of Reyes Munoz _ because Munoz (21-4) was taken
from the ring on a stretcher and spent the night in a Norwich
hospital with a concussion. Gatti (30-4) did not come out of his
dressing room for the post-fight news conference at the casino,
which is in Mashantucket.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston (28-1) scored a unanimous 12-round decision over Angel
Manfredy but wound up in the hospital as well, having a cut over
his eye stitched up and undergoing head X-rays, which showed no
broken bones. Manfredy (28-4-1) also went to the hospital, to have
X-rays of his hand. They were negative, but his ego took a
bruising, as he had predicted he would walk away with Johnston's
title.
</P>
<P>
   Gatti's previous three fights _ all losses _ had been bloody
battles. Manfredy stopped him on cuts in the seventh round two
years ago and Gatti lost two decisions in toe-to-toe skirmishes
with Ivan Robinson last year. The Munoz fight was to be a respite
from the ring rigors Gatti had been encountering.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz, who has spent his days making concrete barriers in an
Erie, Pa., factory and his nights training for bouts, seemed to
have a credible record. But it didn't take long to discover he was
completely overmatched against Gatti, who was once the junior
lightweight champion of the International Boxing Federation and was
moving up two weight classes to junior welterweight.
</P>
<P>
   Lou DiBella, HBO/TVKO's senior vice president for programming,
agreed to the bout for HBO's ``Boxing After Dark'' series. ``Did
the kid have a shot against Gatti?'' DiBella asked. ``No. But you
couldn't tell that from looking at the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in the first round, Gatti caught Munoz with a right to the
back of his head after Munoz tried to duck a punch. As Munoz fell
backward, Gatti caught him near the temple with a left hand. Munoz
fell to the canvas, but wobbled to his feet. His eyes were rolling
as Referee Ed Cotton waved off the fight. Munoz staggered across
the ring to his corner and was placed on his stool. A few seconds
later, Dr. Anthony Alessi, the ringside neurologist, called for a
stretcher. Munoz's mother and wife, also at ringside, wept as he
was removed.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Schwartz, the chief ringside physician, said Munoz
was alert and responsive when taken from the ring. A paramedic said
that on the ride to the hospital, Munoz nearly lost consciousness.
He was listed in stable condition at the hospital and given a CAT
scan that was normal. Arthur Henick, a spokesman for Foxwoods, said
Sunday that Munoz's condition had been upgraded to good and that he
was expected to be released from the hospital later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston put on a masterly display of boxing against Manfredy,
who had moved up from junior lightweight (130 pounds) to
lightweight (135 pounds) to challenge for another world title.
Johnston and Manfredy were more evenly matched than Gatti and
Munoz, but Johnston proved that he was slightly quicker by beating
Manfredy to the punch more often. Johnston's left-handed style also
troubled Manfredy. He never seemed to figure it out and it didn't
work in the best interest of his style, which is to attack the
body.
</P>
<P>
   Although he lost, Manfredy, 24, didn't lose much standing in
boxing. He remains one of the top lightweight contenders after
losses to two of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the sport,
Johnston and Floyd Mayweather Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still a lot of good fights for him,'' DiBella said.
``You fight a fighter the level of Johnston and lose, it doesn't
end your career.''

FUGITIVE, HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT, ELUDED INTERNATIONAL DRAGNET

 (ATTN: Conn.)  (A longer version of this story will move by 9 p.m. ET.) 
(rk) 
(The following article is based on reporting by Katherine E.
Finkelstein, Joseph Kahn and John Tagliabue and was written by

<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last three months, Martin R. Frankel, a sometimes clumsy
fugitive who fled the United States with cases of computers and an
entourage of traveling companions, has managed to evade an
international manhunt by some of the world's most sophisticated law
enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel, who federal investigators suspect of stealing as much
as $350 million from U.S. insurance companies, spent the first
weeks of summer hiding in plain sight in Rome, strolling along the
Villa Borghese park on brilliant afternoons and sipping espresso in
open-air cafes.
</P>
<P>
   His was not a low-profile exile. According to associates and one
of the women who was with him, he risked exposure by repeatedly
phoning friends in the United States and by relying for help on
people known to have had associations with him in the past. Six
weeks after arriving in Rome, he arranged for another young female
friend to fly from America to join him.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a 177-nation Interpol alert, Frankel has lived openly in
Italy and has visited Spain and possibly France, juggling aliases
and bank accounts faster than courts can seize his money.
</P>
<P>
   He is believed to have left Rome in early July, and American
authorities acknowledge that the trail has gone cold. For now, the
financier's hastily arranged but oddly successful flight appears to
be an instance in which the cooperation among the world's national
police forces is more impressive in theory than it is in practice.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the American pursuit of Frankel complained that
European authorities have not helped matters. In Italy, the FBI,
which at one time in early July felt it had a fix on Frankel's
location, waited days to get an arrest warrant issued by local
magistrates. Frankel had moved on. Italian law enforcement
officials declined to comment on the Frankel case.
</P>
<P>
   But while he has kept a step ahead of police, Frankel seems to
have found life on the lam a source of constant complaints. Mona
Kim, an American confidante of Frankel who traveled with him to
Italy, and others who followed his trail, relate a tale of a
spoiled, fearful man with no evident talent for international
intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   The reedy, bespectacled 44-year-old, who often secluded himself
in his Greenwich, Conn., home, spoke no Italian, and could not call
a taxi on his own. A notoriously fussy eater, he told traveling
companions he could not abide pasta and sent them around Rome for
Chinese take-out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was terrified that everybody was going to hurt him,'' Ms.
Kim said. ``He needed a lot of comforting and nurturing. He really
just hated the place so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Prone to pitiful mistakes, worthy of ``The Pink Panther's''
Inspector Clouseau, Frankel relied more on good luck than careful
planning to keep him out of trouble. On at least one occasion, he
stumbled into a situation that might have led to his arrest but
bluffed his way to safety. He also almost fell into a trap set by a
British tabloid which may have come close to capturing Frankel on
its own.
</P>
<P>
   National police forces have historically had a difficult time
collaborating on international cases that involve complex financial
dealings. But Frankel's success in avoiding capture in Italy, a
nation with which the United States has an extradition treaty and a
history of cooperation on drug and Mafia cases, is noteworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities still hope that Frankel might use up his money, make
more mistakes, even turn himself in. But it is also possible that
he will join a long list of fugitive financiers who have
embarrassed the police with their maneuvers abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Vesco, accused of looting $225 million from an investment
fund in 1973, escaped an indictment in the United States for years
before running into new troubles in Cuba. Marc Rich, wanted in the
United States for evading nearly $50 million in taxes, lives openly
in Switzerland, where tax crimes are not grounds for extradition.

   ATLANTA _ One thing about being deprived of the right to drive
yourself wherever you want to go in your own car is that the
sympathy of the nation is with you. Friends have called me from
faraway Chattanooga, Memphis and that lovely spot Louisville. They
know what terrible thing is happening to you and they sympathize.
It's not as if your house burned down or your teenage granddaughter
ran off with a gangster. It's not even as if the little children in
the family discovered head lice in their bonny locks or your trusty
watchdog started biting the neighbors. But it's bad.
</P>
<P>
   A person should have her own car. She should drive whenever or
wherever she pleases. And no one should tell her nay. But there are
naysayers all over the place and they will come and sit by your
bedside and say things like, ``'Tine, you wouldn't want to run over
a child, now would you?'' Have I ever run over a child? Of course
not.
</P>
<P>
   The annoying thing is that you keep yearning for the old days
when you and your car were inseparable buddies. The first car I
ever had was a lovesome thing that shimmied when we drove it down
Dauphin Street in Mobile. My buddies and I would pile in it and set
out for a little adventure and we'd get about even with Zoghby's
merchandise and it would start shimmying like some intoxicated
dancer. We would all pile out, take hold of fenders and doors and
shake the chassis like our lives depended on it. It invariably
brought the tin lizzie out of whatever held it in clutch and we
would proceed with dignity toward the waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that was early in my driving experience. I started at
age 14 _ no driver's license in those days _ and I would go until I
got scared of the heavy Mobile traffic or my friends got scared and
ordered me to pull over and park. Heavy Mobile traffic in those
days amounted to about a car or two moving lazily through the
oak-shaded streets at the rate of one every ten minutes.
</P>
<P>
   We knew people who had fancier, faster cars and zipped out
Government Street at high speed. For ourselves we edged over to the
curb on Springhill Avenue and parked by the big St. Joseph's
church, ate our lunch and spent our nickle for a Milky Way and then
looked for something exciting to do. Looking back I am indebted to
that little old car for some of the richest experiences of my life.
</P>
<P>
   If it hadn't been for having wheels of my own and the right to
drive them I never would have spent the day in a Dauphin Street
bawdy house, courtesy of my friend whose aunt ran the
establishment. I don't exactly recommend it as wholesome high
school recreation but still it was interesting. We became friends
with a couple of ``the girls,'' rather attractive young women who
taught us how to pluck our eyebrows and lent us movie magazines.
And after they had received a gentleman caller they ordered up
barbecue for everybody . On the whole, an interesting day.
</P>
<P>
   But the best days my little car provided were at Bates Field,
Mobile's airport. You could park at the edge of the muddy, unpaved
field and watch those glamorous, barn-storming birdmen all day
long. Toward the end of the day, feeling sorry for us penniless
aviation fans, they sometimes offered us free rides over Mobile
bay.
</P>
<P>
   Who else but the owner and driver of a shimmying Ford had it so
lucky? You see, you've just about got to have a car and the right
to drive it.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, my father felt the same about wheels for the kid. I
drove to town to high school and once I hit a pine tree, doing
something serious to the steering gear. He and our mechanic, Percy,
drove a mule wagon over to Creola and hauled my car home, working
on it all night so I could drive it to town the next day. Some
families understand about the great spiritual bond that exists
between people and cars. Some don't. But I think there must be ways
of learning them.
</P>
<P>
   If I can hold out against family and doctors and other benighted
souls like that I 'll check in with you later.

 &HT;    Back porch soothes when sleep won't come
 &HT;    EDITOR'S NOTE: Celestine Sibley's last published column appeared

   ATLANTA _ There'll come a night when you can't sleep. It has to
do with doctors and pills and trips to the drugstore, and you pull
up the cover and turn on all the lights in your room, and stack up
books you may or may not want to read. But you can't sleep.
</P>
<P>
   On such a night it's wonderful if you have a screened-in back
porch.
</P>
<P>
   Bats and things bam against the screens. Cats stick their paws
into whatever cracks they can find and make insistent pleas to get
inside.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't let them. You pull up a chair, turn a cushion
hoping to reverse the wet side so it won't ruin your last dry
nightgown, and you wonder what it was you used to think about when
nights were made for sleeping and you didn't dwell at all on
illness and medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Food used to be the antidote for sleepless nights. I tried that
the other night. My young kinswoman Faith had arrived with a Key
lime pie, which we stuck so far back in the refrigerator that we
forgot about it.
</P>
<P>
   Key lime, I thought, beach pie. They make it down at Julia Mae's
near our house on Dog Island. It's not as good as the coconut, but
it's good, and at midnight, who's choosy? The trouble is that you
stumble a bit fishing it out of the refrigerator, and Key lime has
a tendency to slither, but sooner or later you and it are anchored
in the swing and the creaking of the swing chains seems to soothe.
</P>
<P>
   You think over the books that await you upstairs, but _ like the
pie _ they are not as seductive as you thought. Tiresome murders,
even a history or two that ordinarily would appeal, but nothing
hair-raising, or even cover raising.
</P>
<P>
   On such a night when the weather turns cool, it's good to have
that extra piece of cover handy. Old quilts are intended for such a
night. When they are old and faded and almost weightless, you pull
them up and remember the women who made them and the families they
``kivvered'' with them.
</P>
<P>
   You might even, if you have a sudden and unprecedented burst of
energy, pick up a needle and thread and mend a raveling hem or
replace a ragged patch. But better to sit in the dark and listen to
the night noises, the whippoorwill down in the woods, the crickets
by the corn crib, the settling and stirring of the rain-soaked
earth.
</P>
<P>
   You wonder why you can't sleep. It's not a normal weakness. It's
the kind of thing that happens when your life seems out of kilter.
Family has gathered. Beds are all filled. Table is set for
breakfast. It doesn't seem normal or reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   You try to think of mundane necessities. Are there enough clean
towels to go around? Instead, you ask yourself what the doctor
meant when he said ...? Why did the druggist think the high cost of
pills had eased off a bit? He said ....
</P>
<P>
   What do you care what they said? It's time to totter up the
stairs and get back into bed. It's time not to care if towels run
out or some of the family simply hates eggs for breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Presently, there are headlights cruising over the tops of the
trees by the driveway. The youngest grandson has come home. In a
little while, another will be heard from _ time to start to town
for a workaday job. My dog yawns. The cats take a final swipe at
the unopening screen door. The Key lime pie has slipped and fallen
somewhere between the wing cushions.
</P>
<P>
   There always have been nights when you couldn't sleep. My mother
once told me, as we sat on the porch on Penn Avenue one rainy
night, that we couldn't get out of anything by dying. ``The women
in our family live forever,'' she remarked dismally.
</P>
<P>
   We do, and come to think of it, that's not such a bad outlook.
Bed and books and a spare quilt suddenly seem mighty attractive.

   ATLANTA _ There'll come a night when you can't sleep. It has to
do with doctors and pills and trips to the drugstore, and you pull
up the cover and turn on all the lights in your room, and stack up
books you may or may not want to read. But you can't sleep.
</P>
<P>
   On such a night it's wonderful if you have a screened-in back
porch.
</P>
<P>
   Bats and things bam against the screens. Cats stick their paws
into whatever cracks they can find and make insistent pleas to get
inside.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't let them. You pull up a chair, turn a cushion
hoping to reverse the wet side so it won't ruin your last dry
nightgown, and you wonder what it was you used to think about when
nights were made for sleeping and you didn't dwell at all on
illness and medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Food used to be the antidote for sleepless nights. I tried that
the other night. My young kinswoman Faith had arrived with a Key
lime pie, which we stuck so far back in the refrigerator that we
forgot about it.
</P>
<P>
   Key lime, I thought, beach pie. They make it down at Julia Mae's
near our house on Dog Island. It's not as good as the coconut, but
it's good, and at midnight, who's choosy? The trouble is that you
stumble a bit fishing it out of the refrigerator, and Key lime has

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some called themselves spiritual amateurs, confessing
that their knowledge of his teachings was not particularly deep.
Others were devotees, steeped in the practices of Tibetan Buddhism
and, in some cases, sharing the Dalai Lama's exile from his home
country.
</P>
<P>
   Worshipful or merely curious or somewhere in between, they
gathered by the tens of thousands in Central Park's East Meadow
Sunday for the simplest of reasons: to hear the spiritual leader of
Tibet give a free public lecture on the basics of leading a life of
kindness and happiness.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, which the police estimated at 40,000, was as diverse
as the city itself. But interviews with some of the attendees
suggested a common search.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had some really rough times the past few years,'' Diana
Popescu, a 31-year-old stylist, said. ``I needed to hear what he
had to say about altruism, compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Chien, 20, said had come Sunday hoping that she would
find guidance from the Dalai Lama about her future. She wants to go
into finance, she said, ``but spiritually I'm not sure that will
help people.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said that she is Chinese, and had learned about China's
treatment of Tibet only when she came to live in the United States
nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wish I could do something for Tibet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Thupten Dadak was one of many Tibetans in the crowd, with many
of the women in colorful traditional dress. Dadak had flown in from
Minnesota, where he sells collectible dolls, to be rejuvenated and
refocused in the presence of his revered spiritual leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come to purify my negativities,'' he said. By hearing the
teaching, again, ``I will try my best again to be good.''
</P>
<P>
   After being introduced by the actor Richard Gere, the Dalai Lama
spoke for well over an hour, his image broadcast on a large screen
for those unable to see the stage.
</P>
<P>
   He focused on how to train the mind to achieve inner peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life, when I look back, has not been easy,'' he said,
referring to his years in exile and China's repression of Tibet.
``One thing I learned,'' he said, ``was that compassion, a sense of
caring, thinking about other's welfare, that sort of mental
attitude brings me inner peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as he practiced his mental transformation, he said, every
human being has equal potential to do so _ maybe more. And then he
took the crowd through eight prayers to train the mind. ``I have
nothing to offer you, miracle things _ nothing,'' he said, by way
of saying it would not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   He stressed a few central themes, lacing them with jokes and
personal anecdotes: Problems would not be solved by material
things. Anger is destructive. The way to inner peace is
nonviolence, which he said was not just the absence of violence,
but ``the manifestation of compassion.'' But, he said, nonviolence
does not mean that ``we remain indifferent about problems _ we must
fully engage.''
</P>
<P>
   He stressed the increasing interconnectedness of all human
beings in a global world, so that ``the destruction of your
neighbor is actually the destruction of yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked about the great wealth in America, and the great
poverty, and said that the capitalist system should be used to make
money _ and the socialist system to help the poor benefit from the
profits.
</P>
<P>
   He encouraged society to embrace those _ whether criminals or
persons with AIDS _ that it had cast out.
</P>
<P>
   He said inner spiritual development was not necessarily linked
to religious faith and he encouraged the crowd to weave the
practice into their own religious traditions. Mark Nason, a
40-year-old engineering manager, was doing just that: he had just
come from Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral. The Dalai Lama, he said,
is ``closest thing to Gandhi here on earth,'' and so it seemed
perfectly natural for a practicing Irish Catholic to trek uptown to
see perhaps the world's most famous Buddhist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real New York experience,'' Nason said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama occasionally used a translator _ ``As I am
getting older, my English is also getting older,'' he said. Still,
some in the audience said they could not understand everything he
said. Others, at the back of the crowd, said they could not hear
him clearly.
</P>
<P>
   Dorota Wnuk, 44, an interior designer from Manhattan, complained
that his talk was geared too much to those who know too little. ``I
wasn't very happy with the speech,'' she said. ``I would expect
less introductory matter, something more in depth.''
</P>
<P>
   But more people at the park seemed to take away something of
what they had come in search of, and they praised the Dalai Lama
for being down-to-earth, for not elevating himself above those he
addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Saltzman, 50, a computer-system designer, said she did not
hear everything he had to say; she was watching two children. But,
she said, ``It made me think about not getting so caught up in
who's right and who's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   If, she added, ``I can remember that by tomorrow.''

<P>
   NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. _ President Clinton, his wife, his daughter
and his mother-in-law piled into the family Air Force C-20 Sunday
morning and went house-hunting in Westchester County, where they
made five stops and paused to schmooze with some of their
prospective neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton prepares to leave public life and Hillary Rodham
Clinton gears up for an effort to join it, the family swept through
the wealthy New York City suburbs with about as much casualness as
one can muster when accompanied by a black sedan, two sport-utility
vehicles, three police cruisers and four mini-vans.
</P>
<P>
   They even stopped for (most) stop signs.
</P>
<P>
   Two aides trundled off the plane with heavy coolers, apparently
packed to ensure that the Clintons could concentrate on the task at
hand instead of having to search for a drive-through. And they were
pretty diligent: The first family had planned to stay for less than
four hours, but wound up riding around for more than six.
</P>
<P>
   They announced no decision. Aides have said the president and
Mrs. Clinton definitely plan to move to Westchester, although they
may rent instead of buying. The couple were accompanied by Chelsea
and Mrs. Clinton's mother, Dorothy Rodham, for a trip that was
labeled ``private time'' by the White House, but which was taken at
government expense.
</P>
<P>
   Before the White House, the Clintons had been living in the
Governor's Mansion in Arkansas, and have no home to return to when
he leaves office in 2001. And if Mrs. Clinton is to run for senate
next year, she must establish a residence in New York by election
day.
</P>
<P>
   At one stop, according to witnesses, Clinton wandered out the
kitchen door to kibbitz with friends of the homeowner.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in Manhattan or the Hamptons, where such an exercise
might be greeted with pointed indifference, crowds waited for hours
outside two of the houses, and several curious people made U-turns
to see what the commotion was about. While many people complained
about the intrusion, they still stood and gawked.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest throng gathered outside a four-story house that is
swathed in pale-pink stucco and shaded by a weeping-willow tree,
with a marble foyer and a pool out back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill's in there checking the kitchen, maybe flushing a toilet,
looking for leaks,'' said Steven M. Green, 55, a hand surgeon who
lives a block away.
</P>
<P>
   A baby shower across the street broke up as the revelers spilled
outside, where they were greeted by Secret Service agents wielding
magnetic wands. The honoree, Suzanne Stauffer, 35, said gamely,
``This was supposed to be a surprise shower, and I'm sure
surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   The excursion took the Clintons down winding roads loaded with
country clubs and tree-shrouded estates with fountains in front.
Even though the houses were mostly seven-figure offerings on
private roads or behind iron gates, several homeowners said they
believed the first family would improve property values if they
moved in.
</P>
<P>
   The first family finished the day in Edgemont, at a $1.7 million
hilltop house on a corkscrew of a major street known to locals as
``Suicide Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   A local resident, Jon Cramer, 44, said he doubted that Mrs.
Clinton would prevail if she decides to run for the Senate, where
she most likely would face New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she'll move in, lose the election, move out and leave
the imprimatur on the neighborhood,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Mitchell, who lives two blocks from the Edgemont house,
was one of many who said they believed the hoopla would die down in
a hurry. ``We have a number of celebrities around here _ I'm
constantly bumping into David Hartman,'' she said. ``After a
fashion, it would become everyday.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Plenty of people fretted about the traffic, but Anna Dekker, 47,
said, ``I don't think I'm going to run into them in C-Town,''
referring to a local grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Glassman, 27, a computer consultant who lives near the
Edgemont house and was wearing a T-shirt from the Black Dog on
Martha's Vineyard _ where the Clintons have vacationed _ said he
saw political overtones to the search. ``They want to look like
they're doing what the average Joe would do,'' he said. ``It is
kind of cool.''
</P>
<P>
   The first stop was in the village of Rye Brook, where the
Clintons disappeared down a long drive at a house labeled
``Brokenwood.'' A house with a swing set is next door, modest
split-levels across the street. A woman in a black Mercedes station
wagon rolled down her window and asked what was up. When reporters
and aides hesitated briefly, she said with irritation, ``I live
right here. What's going on?'' No one said a word, but suddenly a
light dawned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't tell me,'' she said, looking stricken. ``President
Clinton! Come on! Oh, come on.'' She zoomed away.
</P>
<P>
   Next up was Pound Ridge, which was remote enough to make
cellular-phone use problematic for the Clintons' entourage. Their
third stop was at a home in Mamaroneck, but reporters were
prevented from seeing the house.
</P>
<P>
   After that, they headed for New Rochelle. William O'Shaughnessy,
a local broadcast executive, said the interior of the house they
saw is heavy on velvet and velour. ``In Arkansas, this is a
mansion,'' he said. ``Here, it's a substantial manor house.''
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor, Myrna Root, who has been inside many times,
described the architectural style as ``Mediterranean, with a hint
of Tudor.''
</P>
<P>
   An owner of the house, Vic Vuksanaj, said the Clintons ``liked
everything they saw. They haven't decided anything yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the traffic jam, Phil Papa, 33, said, ``This is a
reality check about what would happen if you had a former president
in your neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   But the objections seemed to melt when, in their only contact
with the public Sunday, the president and Mrs. Clinton came outside
and signed autographs for neighbors, who had been corralled behind
a candy-striped rope. Clinton wore a yellow Oxford shirt, a blue
blazer, brown slacks and brown shoes, while Mrs. Clinton had on a
dark suit. Mrs. Clinton accepted a kiss from a man in the crowd who
said she would be a great senator.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea Clinton had ducked into the silver Suburban with five
antennas that was ferrying the family. The crowd cheered for her
and, as if answering a curtain call, she emerged and grinned as she
shook hands. Clinton patted his daughter on the back, and rubbed
his wife's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Burrell, 38, said she would love to have Mrs. Clinton as
a neighbor. ``She seems very normal,'' Ms. Burrell said as the
motorcade fired its engines. ``Very normal.''

 &HT;    Enough about Kathie Lee . . . Regis looks like a million bucks
 &HT;    TV PREVIEW
 &HT;    ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?''
 &HT;    Starts at 8:30 tonight on ABC. Airs every night, except Aug. 23,
for two weeks ending Aug. 29. To be a contestant, call
1-900-933-9391.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Regis Philbin, considered by many the better half of ABC's
popular morning shmoozefest ``Live With Regis and Kathie Lee,'' is
confident that Americans will watch his new, two-week prime-time
game show for one simple reason: They love money.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the hit British show with the same name, ``Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire?'' has a classic format: Reasonably smart people
answer multiple choice questions on different topics. The more
questions they answer correctly, the more money they make, leading
up to the $1 million jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of twists: Contestants can consult the studio
audience or make a phone call to a friend if they get stuck on a
question.
</P>
<P>
   We spoke to Philbin about the show ... and a few other things:
</P>
<P>
   Q.Why are you doing this show now?
</P>
<P>
   A: For a long time people have been approaching me about
reviving old shows like ``What's My Line,'' but I didn't want to do
an old show. Then along comes this thing with high technology and a
million-dollar payoff, and it was something new.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Will this be better than dealing with Kathie Lee every
morning?
</P>
<P>
   A: This will be a little easier than dealing with Kathie Lee,
because she's so unpredictable. I'll miss doing the ad libs with
her, though.
</P>
<P>
   Q:The British have a reputation for bad teeth. What about your
contestants?
</P>
<P>
   A: noticed that too when I went over there to see the show. I
don't know. ... whoever comes in the door can sit there and go for
the million bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Q:The British set looks like the Starship Enterprise. Will you
have the same set?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, we will. But I feel like I'm blasting off to the moon on
that set. I don't know if we need all those lights and stuff. It's
futuristic as hell, but you get used to it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you just doing this for the cash?
</P>
<P>
   A: I wish I owned a piece of the show, but I'm just a working
stiff.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How would you do if you were a contestant?
</P>
<P>
   A: You don't have to be a physics professor to score big on this
show. The British contestants were just plain folks, and some of
them came in their overalls. But I took the preliminary test and I
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is doing this show just a subtle way of telling Kathie Lee
``it's over''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Enough with Kathie Lee already! (Laughing.) We're going to be
on for at least two more years. I consider myself a lucky guy,
because no matter what happens with this new show, I'll still be
able to go on every morning and talk about whatever I want to for
20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You look pretty fit. How much do you bench?
</P>
<P>
   A: Thank you. I do about 180 pounds about 10 times, and I weigh
158 pounds. Pretty good, huh?

ANALYSIS: DOUBT CAST ON RUSSIAN CLAIMS IN DAGESTAN FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Trying to reassure an anxious nation that it was not
being drawn into a Chechnya-like quagmire, Russian commanders
insisted Sunday that Islamic militants dug into remote mountain
strongholds in the southern republic of Dagestan were already on
the verge of defeat.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of fighting, commanders said Russian warplanes,
helicopters and artillery had begun to decimate the rebels. Now,
they insisted, Russian troops were ferreting out the die-hards to
destroy Shamil Basayev, the Chechen commander of the insurgents,
and his band of rebels once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about a total liquidation of the militants,''
Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, the chief of the Russian general staff,
boldly declared.
</P>
<P>
   But some of Russia's most knowledegable military specialists are
skeptical that a victory can be delivered within the two weeks the
commanders have promised _ if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Dagestan, they say, may not be another Chechnya _ a bloody
two-year war that killed tens of thousands, humiliated the
once-proud Russian military and led to the de facto independence of
that republic.
</P>
<P>
   But it does present similar traps, they warn, like being lured
into a heavy-handed and widening military campaign that risks
alienating the local population. Even in this early stage, the
conflict has become an unwelcome challenge to a Russian military
left demoralized by the Chechen war and which sought to restore
some of its lost luster this summer by racing to Kosovo ahead of
NATO peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian military has learned nothing from Chechnya and is
totally unprepared for this war,'' said Pavel Felgenhauer, a
military analyst with the newspaper Segodnya. ``It can't be done
with airpower alone and the troops are not good enough to take the
ground. Shamil Basayev still has the initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Chechnya, there are several important political factors
in the Russians' favor this time. The local authorities in
Dagestan, as well as a multitude of ethnic groups, are so far
backing the campaign against the militants, who say they want to
set up a new Islamic state. Nor do the rebels have the support of
the Chechen government in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of sheer firepower, the rebels are heavily outgunned
and have not been able to infiltrate Dagestan's major towns and
cities, a telling development for those who recall how the Chechen
rebels turned Grozny into an urban killing zone for Russian armored
columns.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians of all stripes in Moscow also seem to back the
military campaign, including sharp critics of the Chechen war like
Grigory Yavlinsky, the leader of the Yabloko party.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is radically different from what occurred in Chechnya,''
Yavlinsky said Sunday. ``That was a war by separatists who had 95
percent of the population behind them. This is aggression by
Islamic extremists against Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   But the insurgents do have some things going for them. They know
the mountain terrain and are familiar with Russian air and ground
tactics from the Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
   They are also counting on confusion among the hodge-podge of
paratroop, Interior Ministry and police units that constitutes the
Russian force in Dagestan _ a problem that bedeviled the Russian
military during the Chechen conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Russian commanders insist they have streamlined their command
structure in Dagestan and have vowed to produce a victory within
the next two weeks. If so, they have accomplished a miraculous
transformation.
</P>
<P>
   Just before he was ousted as prime minister on Aug. 9, Sergei
Stepashin complained that no one was really in charge of the
situation in Dagestan because Russian commanders were reluctant to
put their reputations on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who remember 1994 and 1995 are afraid to take
responsibility,'' Stepashin said, referring to the disastrous
Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
   Lodged between the oil-rich Caspian Sea and the mountains of the
North Caucuses, Dagestan has only about 2 million people, drawn
from more than 30 ethnic groups. While Russia's economic crisis has
weakened Moscow's authority there, the Dagestan authorities want to
remain part of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting began when Basayev and Khattab, a Jordanian-born
militant who joined up with the Chechen leader during the Chechen
war, led hundreds of Islamic militants across the border and
proclaimed that they would establish a new Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows for sure how many fighters are involved, but the
Russian Interior Ministry has estimated that there are 1,200
militants.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military has declined to say how many troops it has
in Dagestan, but experts estimate they number several thousand,
several hundred of which are directly involved in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   While Russian commanders insist they have enough combat-hardened
troops, several thousand of Russia's best paratroopers are not
available for the fight. They are on peacekeeping missions in
Bosnia-Herzogovina and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Russian officials say that 14 Russian soldiers and more
than 200 guerrillas have been killed in the fighting in Dagestan.
The rebels deny they have suffered such heavy losses and say they
have killed far more Russian troops, including three Russian
prisoners who were allegedly shot when they tried to escape.
</P>
<P>
   This is a conflict, however, that involves politics as much as
body counts. If the Russians level Dagestan villages and
settlements in their hunt for the rebels, they risk turning the
local population against them.
</P>
<P>
   Large-scale bombing raids or even a ground assault against rebel
bases in Chechnya might deprive the militants of their havens near
Dagestan. But they could also incite more Chechens to join the
militants. In fact, some analysts think Basayev's strategy is to
lure the Russians to do precisely that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you escalate you are giving the enemy an advantage,'' said
Dimitri Trenin, a former lieutenant colonel in the Russian military
and the deputy director of the Moscow office of the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of mounting an all-out offensive, Trenin said, the
Russian military should try to contain the rebels in Dagestan by
conducting a diplomatic effort to cut off their foreign sources of
financial support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Military force alone will not yield the results Russia is
looking for,'' he said. ``There is no quick-fix policy.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is not how the Russian military is talking. On Sunday,
Col. Gen. Anatoly Kornukov, the commander of the Russian air force,
told the Russian news agency Interfax that the Islamic militants
would soon be defeated by a punishing offensive involving the
``full-scale'' use of airpower.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the bravado on both sides, the conflict still
appears to be in the early stages. Responding to the incursion by
the militants, the Russian military has poured troops into Botlikh,
a town near the Chechen border which is surrounded by
rebel-infested hills. And for several days Russian troops have been
fighting to take the high ground.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Russian Interior Ministry in Dagestan
asserted that the Russians had killed another 21 rebels on Sunday
and that only four of the 32 villages in the Botlikh region were
now controlled by the militants.
</P>
<P>
   Dagestani authorities, for their part, announced Sunday that
Dagestani villagers had foiled a column of 60 militants led by
Basayev's brother by carrying out a daring ambush that involved
rolling boulders onto the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels said they would respond to the Russian attacks with a
new offensive. And even the Russians conceded that the militants
were continuing to send reinforcements from Chechen territory.
</P>
<P>
   As the fighting intensified, Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov
warned the Russians not to carry out attacks against targets in
Chechnya and decreed a monthlong state of emergency, which calls
for a 10 p.m. curfew and the moblization of veterans of the Chechen
war.
</P>
<P>
   Russian planes struck a rebel base on Friday near the Chechen
town of Kenkhi, located near the border with Dagastan. But the
Russians have not announced any bombing attacks against Chechen
targets since then.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have also insisted that they are not planning a
land invasion of Chechnya despite Gen. Kvashnin's vow to wipe out
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the swirl of allegations and countercharges, it has not
always been clear how Russian forces have been used. Last week, two
Soviet-made warplanes zoomed over Georgia, which borders Chechnya,
and dropped Soviet-made cluster bombs.
</P>
<P>
   After initially denying that any air attack took place, Russian
authorities conceded that there had been a bombing raid but stopped
short of acknowledging that Russian aircraft were involved. And
Russia's air force chief made no mention of the incident on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am absolutely satisfied with the Air Force's operation
against the militants,'' he said.

CALL TO THE BULLPEN BRINGS A MANAGER: LYLE ENJOYS RETURN TO
BASEBALL 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By ANDREW R. TRIPALDI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 16 seasons in the major leagues, three World Series
championships and the Cy Young Award, the former Yankee pitcher
Sparky Lyle thought he had accomplished about everything in
professional baseball.
</P>
<P>
   But one aspect of the game had eluded him since he retired after
the 1982 season with 238 saves; Lyle had never managed a team at
any level. Although he was not actively pursuing a managerial
position, Lyle, 54, wanted to keep his options open and was willing
to listen if a good opportunity presented itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Atlantic League, an independent baseball
alliance, was formed in 1997. One of the six teams was based in
Somerset County, N.J., reasonably close to Lyle's home in Dubois,
Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Kalafer, a co-owner of the Somerset franchise, was
looking for a manager and asked several people in baseball for
references. One of the people Kalafer approached was the
Philadelphia Phillies' third base coach, John Vukovich, a good
friend of Lyle's.
</P>
<P>
   ``John gave him my name,'' Lyle said. Kalafer got in touch with
Lyle, they talked and Kalafer offered him the job. ``I thought it
was a great opportunity,'' Lyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Because Lyle had not participated in any form of organized
baseball since 1982 (he said he spent most of his time playing
golf), he had to brush up on game strategy and the rule book.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle knew that the players he was managing were either trying to
get back to the major leagues after several unproductive seasons,
had suffered a serious injury and were working their way back, or
simply did not possess the talent to reach the next level.
</P>
<P>
   During the Atlantic League's inaugural season in 1998, the
Patriots went 19-31 in the first half and 21-29 in the second half
and finished a combined 40-60, 24 games behind the team with the
best overall record, Bridgeport. That season was a learning
experience both for the players and for Lyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easier to manage at this level than at Class A because
these guys have experience,'' Lyle said. ``For example, in the low
minors you would have to deal with young kids coming directly from
high school and college. They would first have to be acclimated to
the rigors of professional baseball. These guys already have
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Somerset's players are pitchers Dwayne Henry, who has a
14-15 record in 11 major league seasons, mostly with Texas; John
Briscoe, who appeared in 100 games and compiled a 5-5 record and
two saves for the Oakland Athletics over six seasons, and Ricardo
Jordan, who went 1-2 with the Mets in 1997 and is 5-4 over all in
the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Somerset struggled to a 24-36 record in the first half of this
season, which was expanded from 100 games over all to 120. But in
the second half, the Patriots have bounced back, posting a
league-best record of 20-11.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots do not know a lot about Lyle's playing days because
many of them were very young or, in some cases, not even born when
he was in his prime. Lyle does not mind that; he prefers to be
known as the Somerset manager rather than the former Yankee
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle said he was not actively looking for another job, but that
does not mean he would not consider an offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone wants to talk to me about a job at the major league
level, I would be very happy to listen because I think I am
qualified,'' Lyle said. ``But that is not why I took the Somerset
job. I am very happy managing Somerset.''  &QL;

SKIP THE SERMON AND PASS THE SALT: A LITTLE WORKS JUST FINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Visitors to Washington state's Hurricane Ridge in August will
often notice there are more than cars parked in the visitors' lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, isn't that cute,'' a vacationer from Pismo Beach will
exclaim. ``The mama, papa and baby deer are all coming down to see
the tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   Take a second look. The deer are not much interested in the
pudgy people in checkered shorts. They are licking the asphalt.
More specifically, the deer are trying to suck up the antifreeze
spilled from overheated radiators.
</P>
<P>
   Parking lots located at the apex of mountain roads or passes
seem to be appeasing the same primal lust as salt licks.
</P>
<P>
   So far, I haven't been spotted on hands and knees in the parking
lot at Stevens (CQ) Pass, except possibly for the occasional game
of craps.
</P>
<P>
   But, like the mama, papa and baby deer, I lust for salt.
</P>
<P>
   Anchovies, chipped beef, green olives, smoked salmon, salted
peanuts, dill pickles and prosciutto ham all occupy prominent
places on my shopping lists.
</P>
<P>
   Don't give me that scornful glance. Some people are salt
sensitive and must eliminate or reduce the seasoning to avoid high
blood pressure. But studies have indicated this describes only
about 10 percent of the population. And no evidence I have seen
suggests that excess salt will raise the blood pressure of the
other 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   I usually cook with my right hand gripping a wooden spoon. My
left arm is often twisted behind my back by my wife, Alice, who
gives it a painful jerk whenever I try to put excess salt in
recipes we test for this column.
</P>
<P>
   That's reasonable. After all, there is a salt cellar on every
table for individual partialities.
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, there may not be a salt cellar on every
table. There are a couple of restaurants I have visited where salt
and pepper shakers have been banished from sight and reach.
Apparently, they are as objectionable to the chef and servers as
second-day socks substituting for napkins.
</P>
<P>
   This practice is nothing more than pretentious preaching on the
part of people who should know better.
</P>
<P>
   What the chef is telling his customers is, ``You don't know
what's good. I know what's good. Shut up and eat your food.''
</P>
<P>
   This is perhaps the proper attitude for somebody running a penal
colony. It should not be adopted by those who hope to survive in
the restaurant industry. The customer is still ``always right,''
even if he or she sprinkles some salt on the Pasta Puttanesca.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, you probably won't need any salt with this dish
because it contains a can of anchovies. And, after all, you always
cook your pasta in salted water, don't you?
</P>
<P>
   Pasta Puttanesca
</P>
<P>
   4 cloves garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 can (about 10 fillets) anchovies
</P>
<P>
   2 cups chopped tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons capers, drained
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon marjoram
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt, pepper if needed
</P>
<P>
   Red pepper flakes to taste
</P>
<P>
   14-ounce can chopped black olives
</P>
<P>
   In a blender combine the garlic, anchovy fillets, tomatoes,
capers, marjoram, red pepper flakes and olive oil. Blend, then add
more oil from the anchovy can if you want a stronger taste. When
pureed, pour into a pan, add the olives and simmer 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   This should be enough sauce for four portions of tubed pasta
like penne.
</P>
<P>
   Anchovies are also essential in this goop that I like to spread
on triangles of Boboli pizza crust before shoving them briefly
under a broiler.
</P>
<P>
   Red Pepper Spread
</P>
<P>
   17-ounce jar roasted red peppers, drained
</P>
<P>
   3 ounces chopped black olives
</P>
<P>
   4 anchovy fillets
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   One and one-half teaspoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   Salt, pepper
</P>
<P>
   Dice the peppers and anchovy fillets. Mix with the olives,
parsley, olive oil and lemon juice. Add salt and pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Did you ever stop and consider that the great Northwest might
still be a wilderness if Lewis and Clark had not assigned three
members of their party to a task that confronted them near what is
now Seaside, Ore.? They kept the fire burning under five pots of
sea water 24 hours a day between Jan. 2 and Feb. 20, 1806. These
efforts produced the four bushels of salt the explorers felt they
needed to make the return trip back to Thomas Jefferson's front
door.
</P>
<P>
   If it wasn't for salt, Washington and Oregon would still be
listed as ``uncharted territories'' on world maps.
</P>
<P>
   Tell that to your waiter and his big-shot chef.

AUTHOR OF COMPUTER SURVEILLANCE PLAN TRIES TO EASE FEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress has blocked money for a planned system to
safeguard government computers, a prominent Republican has
denounced the system as ``Orwellian'' and some civil libertarians
are calling it a potential threat.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan's author, a senior National Security Council
official, says those are only temporary setbacks to a critically
needed system that will be built if President Clinton wants it.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed system, called Fidnet, is intended to protect
government computers from hackers, whether they be precocious
teen-agers or potential terrorists, administration officials say.
It represents ``the first attempt by any nation to develop a plan
to defend its cyberspace,'' a draft plan by the security council
says. The White House is seeking $1.5 billion in new spending for
the program.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fidnet has been in the works for more than a year, many
in Congress learned about it on July 28, when The New York Times
published details of the draft proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction was swift. Two days later, the House Appropriations
Committee deleted $2 million in start-up money requested by the FBI
to develop the system.
</P>
<P>
   Then the House majority leader, Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas,
denounced Fidnet, saying it raised ``the Orwellian possibility that
unscrupulous government bureaucrats could one day use such a system
to read our personal e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   But the principal author of the plan, Richard Clarke, the
National Security Council's counterterrorism czar, said Congress
would assuredly finance the system once lawmakers understood it and
Clinton gave it the go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president approves Fidnet, there'll be funding for
it,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke, whose formal title is National Coordinator for Security,
Infrastructure Protection and Counterterrorism, has been warning
for years about the threat of an ``electronic Pearl Harbor'' in the
form of an attack on government computers. He said that a
cyberspace assault would be ``as bad as being attacked by bombs,''
and that ``an attack on American cyberspace is an attack on the
United States'' that should trigger a military response.
</P>
<P>
   These fears led last year to a new initiative, called
Presidential Decision Directive 63. Fidnet is one of the first
major computer-security programs to grow out of the directive. It
would cover civilian agencies, like the State Department and the
IRS, and would be modeled on and linked to an existing Pentagon
security system. Ultimately, the plan calls for private companies
to create security links to the government's systems.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke acknowledged that no one in Congress had been briefed on
Fidnet, which has not yet been given a go-ahead by President
Clinton, and that the draft plan had raised questions among civil
libertarians who say it has a potential power to monitor innocent
citizens. But he said Congress and the system's critics had the
wrong idea about the planned surveillance network.
</P>
<P>
   The critics among the civil libertarians question the FBI's role
in the computer monitoring scheme. The bureau already has a
centralized security operation called the National Infrastructure
Protection Center, based in its headquarters, that has received
technical support from the National Security Agency, the
intelligence service that eavesdrops on the rest of the world, and
from the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported that the Fidnet system, too, would
be overseen by the FBI. Clarke's draft plan calls for the National
Infrastructure Protection Center to play a role in analyzing and
responding to any signs of intrusion. But Clarke said in the
interview that while some funds requested for Fidnet were earmarked
for the Justice Department and the bureau, the system ``would not
be run by the FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, it would be established by the General
Services Administration, an independent agency better known for
furnishing government offices than for law enforcement. ``It would
not be monitoring privately owned and operated systems, only
government computers,'' Clarke said. ``And it would not violate
people's privacy rights.''
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that failing to brief Congress was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Because Congress already has a system to detect unauthorized
intrusions into its information systems, it should realize that
``all that Fidnet would be would be the same kind of thing for
sensitive government computers,'' Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has concerns about Justice being the funding source
to pay for intrusion detection mechanisms,'' he said. ``That's a
legitimate concern. When they get the briefing they'll see there's
a requirement to have something like Fidnet.''

   LOS ANGELES _ As the year 2000 approaches, here's a look at some
of the interesting anniversaries that will occur this week in Los
Angeles sports history:

 &HT;    Gators welcome underdog status
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ When Steve Spurrier arrived as head coach in
1990, Florida had never won an SEC championship. By the end of the
1996 season, the Gators had five conference titles plus a national
title. As a result, Florida fans and players began to think of the
SEC championship as a given, the natural birthright that comes with
just being a Gator.
</P>
<P>
   No more. For the past two years Florida has been on the outside
looking in while Tennessee won a pair of SEC championships. Last
season, the Volunteers added insult to injury by also winning the
national title. This year, Tennessee is a near-unanimous pick to
win its third straight SEC title.
</P>
<P>
   While Tennessee has been drawing almost universal praise,
Florida's program made the headlines recently for a less-positive
reason when it was revealed that four players from the 1998 team
had accepted money from an agent, a violation of NCAA rules.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the past two years have been a humbling experience
for the Gators, who once seemed destined to rule the SEC as long as
Spurrier was calling the shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has brought us back to reality, that's for sure,'' said
linebacker Keith Kelsey. ``We now know this thing isn't given to
you. You have to work for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach agrees. Spurrier agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody knows that the last two years we haven't
achieved what we're capable of,'' said Spurrier, set to begin his
10th season at Florida. ``And this year we're not going to be
favorites like we have in the past. But maybe that will be good for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier stops short of saying that his last two teams had
become complacent about winning. After all, both won 10 games,
finished in the Top 10 and played in a New Year's Day bowl.
Florida's only losses last season were to Tennessee (20-17, OT) and
Florida State (23-12), the two teams that played in the Fiesta Bowl
for the national championship. Those games were on the road and the
Gators had opportunities to win both. Florida was good, just not
good enough.
</P>
<P>
   But Spurrier does concede that somewhere along the way, Florida
lost its edge after the 1996 national championship season. There is
a strong feeling in Gainesville that the 1998 defense underachieved
for a group so talented. Ultimately, it could be that the defense
was too talented to stay hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm almost convinced that when a player achieves a lot in
college, they are almost ready to go ahead and move on to the pros
or wherever they want to go,'' said Spurrier. ``The defense played
well, but we just didn't dominate the way we thought we would.''
</P>
<P>
   So Spurrier is not particularly concerned that nine members from
that defense are gone and a 10th, defensive back Rod Graddy, was
kicked off the team last week for violating team rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have excellent players here, they just haven't had a chance
to play much,'' he said. ``I think we're going to surprise some
people with the way our defense plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The offense will be explosive. Quarterback Doug Johnson, who
spent the summer in Gainesville working out instead of playing pro
baseball, is expected to have a huge year. Still, Florida will
enter the 1999 season in an unaccustomed position _ that of
underdog. Spurrier, for one, seems to like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a group of players who are a little closer than the
last few years,'' said Spurrier. ``I think our fans are going to
enjoy watching them.''

WELFARE CARDS GIVE BANKS SOME CONTROL OF POLICY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A few months ago, seemingly with good intentions, the
state of New York gave a new electronic banking card to Margarita
O., an 18-year-old from Mexico and the mother of a baby boy. It is
an unusual debit card. On the front is a picture of her smiling
shyly. The familiar black magnetic stripe on the back gives her
access not to a checking account but to $448 a month in government
food credits and cash.
</P>
<P>
   The card held much promise. She would have the same access
everyone else had to all those automatic teller machines. No more
waiting in lines at check-cashing stores. No more demeaning food
stamps. And just a short walk from her rented room in East Harlem
waited Banco Popular, a cheery neighborhood bank with two gleaming
ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, her card is useless at Banco Popular. In fact, it
has not been accepted at most ATMs in East Harlem and throughout
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Out of frustration, Margarita O., who asked that her last name
not be used, because she is an illegal immigrant, simply walks up
the street to the same check-cashing store where she used to get
her benefits free.
</P>
<P>
   Only now she pays up to $2.35 for each withdrawal _ $1.50 to the
store and 85 cents to Citigroup, the financial conglomerate hired
by the state to distribute welfare benefits through ATM cards. That
money, she has come to realize, is being deducted from the welfare
benefits of her son, who was born in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand,'' she said, ``why they are taking away
money from my child.''
</P>
<P>
   She is enduring the unintended consequences of a sweeping
transformation in the way the nation's poorest citizens receive
cash and food credits from the government. In the last few years,
39 states and the District of Columbia have hired corporations to
distribute welfare benefits through the nation's vast web of ATMs
and grocery-store debit machines.
</P>
<P>
   The states hoped to reduce fraud, save money and draw poor
people into the financial mainstream. They wanted to encourage
better money habits and to provide convenience and simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   But the emerging system has pitted profits against service in a
way that has created new vulnerabilities for millions of welfare
recipients across the country.
</P>
<P>
   They are assessed ATM fees that regular customers do not have to
pay _ fees that are deducted from their welfare benefits. The
number of free withdrawals is severely limited, sometimes to two a
month. Balance inquiries at ATMs are forbidden in many states,
including New York. By the thousands, welfare recipients have
learned at the cash register that their cards often do not work
across state lines.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding over most of this system is Citigroup, the parent of
Citibank and the nation's largest financial-services company. About
12 million Americans in 29 states, including New York, now get
welfare with Citigroup ATM cards. At the end of 1998, Citigroup was
distributing $640 million in welfare benefits each month.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup's dominance is growing. As welfare rolls shrink,
competitors have backed off because there is far less money to be
made. This has strengthened Citigroup's position as it pursues new
contracts and, once it wins contracts, in deciding how welfare
money is delivered.
</P>
<P>
   New York vividly illustrates how the states, by handing off the
cumbersome and politically sensitive task of providing aid to the
poor, have given broad new control over welfare policy to private
corporations, primarily Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   For months, as Citigroup has struggled for profits in the
welfare business, the company did not provide hundreds of thousands
of New York City welfare recipients with access to 23,000 ATMs in
the NYCE network and 40,000 ATMs in the MAC network, the two
largest in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, which will be paid about $80 million by the state
over the next four years to distribute benefits, blocked access by
refusing to pay the full fee charged by other banks for each
transaction. Payment of the full fee would have allowed poor people
to use the same range of ATMs as Citigroup's regular customers.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews over several weeks, Citigroup officials defended
their decision, saying New York City's poor had adequate access to
cash. State welfare officials, while expressing disappointment,
said their contract with the bank gave them little power to tell
Citigroup what to do. ``I really don't have any authority at all to
direct them one way or another,'' said Brian Wing, the state's
commissioner of temporary and disability assistance.
</P>
<P>
   And yet this situation is just as Wing and other welfare
officials planned it. Despite warnings from one state justice who
reviewed the contract, state officials willingly embraced an
ambiguous contract that gave Citigroup a free hand to decide how
New York's poor get access to their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, Citigroup's control was again on display.
After being informed that this article was imminent, Citigroup
officials abruptly announced that starting next month they would
allow access to the NYCE network, though not the MAC network.
</P>
<P>
   They also said they would install 25 ATMs in poor neighborhoods
and embark on an educational program. The measures will cost
Citigroup nearly $2 million this year, the officials said. ``We
succeed when the program succeeds,'' said Brian Claire, senior
director for welfare ATM cards at Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   Claire said Citigroup delivers welfare at a saving to taxpayers,
and with greater convenience. ``We have a great track record,'' he
said. Likewise, he dismissed concerns that Citigroup exerts undue
control over the welfare system, saying, ``The states will dictate
what services they require.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the changes announced Friday, the bank's welfare
customers will still have access to fewer ATMs than regular
customers and they will continue to pay special fees.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And around the country, Citigroup faces mounting criticism.
Benjamin Cayetano, the governor of Hawaii, recently complained in a
letter to Citigroup that its policies have resulted in higher costs
for his state's welfare population.
</P>
<P>
   In Pennsylvania, a food merchants' association blamed Citigroup
for costly system crashes, and one state senator, citing mass
confusion and reduced access to benefits in poor neighborhoods,
demanded a return to paper food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   While Citigroup is subject to a variety of reporting
requirements and oversight, an association of state auditors has
called for more rigorous reviews of Citigroup and other
corporations entrusted with billions of welfare dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more assurance that the companies handling these
transactions are handling them properly,'' said Kathryn
Schwerdtfeger, special assistant to the Texas state auditor.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials, including some who helped create the
system, have become increasingly uneasy with Citigroup's influence
over the nation's welfare system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really concerned about this,'' said Shirley Watkins, who
oversees the nation's food-stamp program as the Department of
Agriculture's undersecretary for food and nutrition. ``If there's a
monopoly on a program like this, it puts us in real jeopardy. There
is no competition. And where there is no competition, people charge
you what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup's growth has implications beyond welfare. The Treasury
Department is pushing hard to use electronic banking for all
federal government payments: Social Security checks, veterans'
checks, tax refunds. While Citigroup has yet to make money
distributing welfare, it is now positioned to become the conduit
for hundreds of billions of dollars in other government payments.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to questions about Citigroup, there are other
difficulties with the new welfare ATM cards. Federal welfare
officials once projected $250 million a year in administrative
savings. No longer. Officials once projected billions in savings
from reduced fraud. No such savings have been shown.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials once predicted that welfare recipients would
get unlimited access to the country's ATMs ``at little or no
cost.'' Instead, for the first time, the nation's poor are paying
millions of dollars in ATM fees and surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   The Promise
</P>
<P>
   Paperless Payments for Greater Efficiency
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind welfare ATM cards was to ``ride the rails'' of
electronic banking and end all the sorting and mailing that go with
distributing mountains of food stamps and welfare checks.
</P>
<P>
   For taxpayers and budget cutters, there was the prospect of
efficiency and cost saving. The new system, championed by Vice
President Al Gore beginning in the early 1990s, was given a clunky
bureaucratic name _ electronic benefits transfer, or EBT. The banks
cast it as a way to help the needy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important benefit,'' Citigroup officials told
regulators, ``is that EBT allows low-income individuals a point of
entry into the mainstream of electronic banking.''
</P>
<P>
   There was money to be made, too. With federal and state
governments paying out about $100 billion a year in public
assistance, companies would earn sizable fees for handling the
transactions, and generate new ATM surcharges and new customers.
</P>
<P>
   While other banks showed interest in welfare ATM cards,
including First Union, Nationsbank and Chase Manhattan, Fleet, none
went after the business more aggressively than Citigroup. Still,
Citigroup's selection by New York in 1996 was controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup was the low bidder, but evaluators ranked the company
third for its ability to handle the technical demands of the job.
Getting food and money to poor people is a complex undertaking. It
requires sophisticated software capable of tracking hundreds of
thousands of people. A telephone line offering help must be
staffed, debit cards issued, recipients trained, equipment
installed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, after challenges from Citigroup competitors, a state
judge threw out the New York contract, noting that Citigroup had
been rated inadequate in ``two of the most important technical
criteria'' _ ensuring enough access to cash and recruiting retail
stores to participate.
</P>
<P>
   But appellate courts overturned the ruling on technical grounds,
and this year the first welfare ATM cards were mailed, first to
Staten Island and then to Manhattan and the Bronx. By November, the
cards will be in Brooklyn and Queens, and the rest of the state
will get them soon after.
</P>
<P>
   Under its contract, Citigroup must demonstrate in each ZIP code
that access to cash under the new ATM system is at least as good as
it was under the old system, in which welfare recipients could go
to any one of hundreds of check-cashing stores, show identification
and get their food stamps and cash. They paid nothing.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Citigroup boasted that it had improved access more
than 1,000 percent in New York City. The claim was misleading.
</P>
<P>
   When neighborhood wealth is taken into account, Citigroup
records show that ATM access increased for poor people who live in
wealthy areas, but decreased in the poorest neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In the three Manhattan ZIP codes with the highest median family
incomes, a total of 461 welfare households may choose from 43 free
ATM locations.
</P>
<P>
   In the three ZIP codes with the lowest incomes, all in Harlem,
14,027 welfare households have access to six free ATM locations.
Under the old system, those families could pick from 15
check-cashing stores where they could get their benefits free.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, though, when Citigroup makes the NYCE network
available to New York City welfare recipients, access to ATMs will
more than triple.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Reality
</P>
<P>
   Malfunctioning Cards and Scarce Machines
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning in the Bronx, hundreds of welfare
recipients, mostly women and children, crowded into a stifling city
welfare center near Crotona Park. Most were there because of their
new welfare ATM cards.
</P>
<P>
   Hermenegil Nunez, a mother of three, said she had spent five
maddening days trying to use her card. The welfare workers said the
numbers on the card were wrong, she said. Twice she was sent to
Manhattan to get replacement cards. Those did not work either. Now
her eyes are filled with anxiety. ``I don't have anything,'' she
said. ``My sister, thank God she made me a little shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   In the lobby, a welfare worker stood by a model of an ATM,
telling a small crowd how the cards work. Paul Hayes, a welfare
recipient, interrupted. ``I've tried four places and it kept saying
the same thing: `Try again, try again,''' he said. The welfare
worker said the magnetic strip on Hayes' card appeared to have been
damaged. A common problem, the worker explained. ``But I only used
it for the first time yesterday,'' Hayes protested.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest complaint at the center is that no one knows which
stores or banks will take them. No one knows what the fees are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Convenient my foot!'' Gail Saunders, another welfare
recipient, said bitterly.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Citigroup has avoided doing for New York welfare
recipients what it has done all along for 117,000 welfare
recipients in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Vermont:
provide access to NYCE, the dominant ATM network in New York state
and a ready-made vehicle for distributing money for the poor. In
New York City alone, there are 3,200 ATMs connected to the NYCE
network.
</P>
<P>
   It boiled down to a dispute over 13 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is an arcane ATM transaction charge that banks pay
to one another. Under NYCE rules, a bank must pay 38 cents when one
of its customers withdraws money from another bank's ATM. Until
Friday, Citigroup said it would pay only 25 cents for withdrawals
by New York welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   That kept Margarita O. from using her neighborhood Banco
Popular, which is part of NYCE.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup's policy prompted its banking rivals to charge that
the company is using its control over the flow of welfare money to
steer customers away from their ATMs. They have also accused
Citigroup of trying to increase its profits at their expense.
Citigroup saved an estimated $130,000 a month by prohibiting access
to NYCE.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citicorp Services Inc. is sacrificing EBT recipient access in
exchange for increasing the profitability of its contract with the
state of New York,'' Denis O'Leary, executive vice president of
Chase Manhattan Bank, wrote in June to state welfare officials.
</P>
<P>
   Before changing their policy on Friday, Citigroup officials
portrayed their competitors' unwillingness to accept the lower fee
as a failure to fulfill their obligation to help the needy. On
Friday, Citigroup officials said they relented to further enhance
service to welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The poor in New York have been stymied by another important link
in Citigroup's system of delivering welfare. To augment their ATM
network, Citigroup officials said they have arranged for hundreds
of grocery stores to allow cash withdrawals by welfare recipients _
just like regular bank customers.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup lists nearly 400 ``cash back'' stores in Manhattan
alone. But on a recent evening in East Harlem, managers in a dozen
small grocery stores on the list all said the same thing: Yes, they
accept welfare ATM cards as payment for food. No, they do not allow
cash withdrawals. They explained that they start the business day
with $100 and would be drained of cash if they allowed withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Immigration Coalition, an advocacy group, surveyed
84 stores in Harlem _ all on the Citigroup lists. Forty-four said
they did not allow cash withdrawals. Of the rest, most charged a
fee or imposed other limits. (Late last week, Citigroup officials
commissioned their own survey of 44 grocery stores in Manhattan and
the Bronx _ with opposite results. Every single store, they said,
agreed to allow cash withdrawals.)
</P>
<P>
   In the confusion, welfare recipients have been returning to
check-cashing stores, which now charge fees for withdrawals using
ATM cards. Citigroup benefits when welfare recipients use its cards
at check-cashing stores, because it does not pay to check-cashing
stores or groceries the fees it must pay to other banks.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Citigroup's system has shifted some costs to
welfare recipients themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, nearly two-thirds of all welfare ATM withdrawals in
the city were made not at free ATMs but at small grocery stores or
check-cashing stores or machines that charged recipients a fee,
state records show. Those fees totaled $275,709.
</P>
<P>
   Wing, the state's top welfare official, acknowledged that
welfare ATM cards shift some costs of welfare to the recipients
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a voluntary shift,'' he said, because welfare
recipients can avoid all fees by finding a free, participating ATM
and limiting withdrawals to four a month. (For each additional
withdrawal, Citigroup charges recipients 85 cents.)
</P>
<P>
   Finding the right ATM can be tough for those unable to log onto
the state Web site that lists the free ATMs. As a test, Liz
Krueger, associate director of the Community Food Resource Center
in Manhattan, said she recently called the Citigroup telephone help
line to find the nearest free ATM. No such information available,
she said the operator told her. Ms. Krueger tried nine more times
over several days. The response never varied.
</P>
<P>
   The help line itself is one barometer of the confusion. In July,
the help line logged 680,342 telephone calls _ many from people
trying to find out how much they had left to spend. (With the
approval of state officials, Citigroup officials decided to
prohibit balance inquiries at ATMs by welfare recipients because of
the expense.)
</P>
<P>
   The phones of local politicians have been ringing, too. Virginia
Fields, the Manhattan borough president, and Fernando Ferrer, the
Bronx borough president, have appealed for better access and
education.
</P>
<P>
   Wing, asked a few weeks ago for his overall assessment of how
the welfare ATM cards are working in New York City, replied, ``It's
going exceedingly well.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Future
</P>
<P>
   Profit Outlook Dims as Welfare Rolls Shrink
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the shortcomings of welfare ATM cards, few people want
to go back to paper. The future is electronic, government officials
say. They acknowledge the confusion, but blame much of it on the
inevitable pain of transforming a complicated system. As problems
are ironed out, they contend, poor people will come to appreciate
the cards. Surveys in some states have shown just that.
</P>
<P>
   Some shortcomings persist. Under federal law, regular ATM
customers are liable for a maximum of only $50 in losses if their
cards are stolen. Those protections do not apply to welfare
recipients. Meanwhile, many of the heady predictions of the early
1990s have not come true. Hopes are fading that the electronic
system will reduce administrative costs by much, if at all. One
early estimate projected $1 billion in savings over five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will probably be cost-neutral,'' acknowledged Ms. Watkins,
the Agriculture Department undersecretary.
</P>
<P>
   As for cutting welfare fraud, one federal study concluded, ``EBT
alone has not effectively deterred fraud in the delivery of
food-stamp benefits.'' Welfare ATM cards have no effect on the
largest source of fraud _ payments to people who misrepresent their
financial circumstances. Billions are lost this way.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, from 1991 to 1997, welfare ATM records enabled the
Agriculture Department to prosecute 234 fraud cases involving a
grand total of $27 million.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic system has fallen short for another constituency
_ Citigroup and the other companies that jumped into the business.
The problem lies in two numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, 28 million Americans were on food stamps. Today,
the number is 18 million. The trouble is that it is a volume
business. So in New York, where Citigroup is paid $1.47 a month for
every household on cash assistance, its revenue diminishes with
each family that leaves welfare. A few years ago, Citigroup
expected to generate $145 million in revenues over the life of the
contract in New York. Now that hundreds of thousands of people have
left New York's welfare rolls, revenue might not exceed $80
million.
</P>
<P>
   Claire declined to reveal Citigroup's earnings from welfare ATM
cards. He said the company had built only a ``very modest profit''
into its bid proposals. ``To date, our EBT business has yet to
realize an operating profit,'' he said. E-Citi, the Citigroup unit
responsible for welfare benefit transfers and other
electronic-banking projects, lost $142 million in 1998 and another
$80 million in the first half of 1999, company reports show.
</P>
<P>
   Deluxe Government Services, a Milwaukee-based company that holds
welfare ATM contracts in eight states, set aside $36.4 million last
year to cover anticipated losses. A third company, Transactive
Corp. of Texas, is pulling out of the business. ``Not profitable,''
a spokesman explained tersely.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, armed with patience and deep pockets, seems intent on
expanding its electronic-welfare business. Last year it agreed to
buy Transactive for $11.5 million, a move that caught the interest
of the Justice Department's antitrust lawyers. The department
measures market dominance with something called the
Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. A score of 1,800 means that the market
is ``highly concentrated.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice lawyers scored Citigroup at 4,225. (Late Friday, a
Citigroup spokesman produced an expert on antitrust law to
challenge the relevance of this score.)
</P>
<P>
   Warning that Citigroup would raise prices and cut services if it
were allowed to buy its ``only substantial competitor,'' the
Justice Department filed a lawsuit to stop the takeover. Though
Citigroup backed off, and the lawsuit was withdrawn, it was not
much of a victory for the department. Transactive is still pulling
out, and Citigroup is negotiating new contracts with several
states.
</P>
<P>
   As state after state switches to electronic welfare, the poor
increasingly find themselves voiceless. Many of the rules governing
the welfare ATM cards are set by an obscure organization called the
EBT Council. An arm of the National Automated Clearing House
Association, a financial trade group in Virginia, the council
includes 57 representatives of major banks, ATM networks, grocery
chains and states.
</P>
<P>
   It does not have a single member from a welfare advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not blocking them from joining _ if they pay the
membership fee,'' a spokeswoman for the EBT Council said.
</P>
<P>
   The fee is $6,000 a year. Plus a $3,000 initiation charge.

CAN DE LA HOYA KEEP HIS DISTANCE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; Robert Alcazar, Oscar De La Hoya's trainer, is only the
slightest bit worried about his fighter's date with Felix Trinidad
on Sept. 18. He boldly predicts it's going to be an easy fight.
</P>
<P>
   His lone concern? Keeping reasonably tight reins on a fine boxer
whose instincts are to brawl.
</P>
<P>
   In his most recent bouts _ particularly those against Julio
Cesar Chavez and Ike Quartey _ De La Hoya has moved at times from
careful boxer-puncher to reckless warrior, at least in part to
please Mexican fans who demand action.
</P>
<P>
   He's won each time _ but at considerable risk.
</P>
<P>
   Alcazar is begging De La Hoya to keep his distance against Felix
Trinidad, a more dangerous puncher than either Chavez or Quartey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest thing right now is to control Oscar, to keep him
from going toe-to-toe the way he did in his last three fights,''
Alcazar said at De La Hoya's Big Bear training camp recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``He fought like that for a reason. He wanted to prove to
himself that he can stay with big punchers. &UR;  &LR; . &UR;  &LR; . &UR;  &LR; . That's the
kind of fighter he is. !ital!Unfortunately, that's the kind of
fighter he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Is De La Hoya getting the message? It seems so, but it's
difficult to tell.
</P>
<P>
   At least 20 television reporters and cameramen were lined up
waiting their turn to interview him on media day in Big Bear.
</P>
<P>
   The well-spoken fighter dutifully and graciously hopped from one
to the next and fielded the same question from almost every one of
them: ``How are you going to fight this guy?''
</P>
<P>
   His answer wasn't always the same, which is typical of De La
Hoya: He'll say whatever he feels like saying in an apparent effort
to keep everyone _ including his opponent _ guessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could say one thing today and another tomorrow,'' he said
with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he seems to understand that his best chance of beating
his most competent foe is to keep his distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past few fights have made me realize that I have . &UR;  &LR; . &UR;  &LR; .
to listen to my corner,'' he said. ``I would sometimes think that
(Alcazar) is wrong and I'm right and I'm going to duke it out
toe-to-toe. I've definitely learned my lesson. I don't have to go
out there and fight. Let's just box and win the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``. &UR;  &LR; . &UR;  &LR; . &UR;  &LR;  I'm coming out cut up, bruised up. That kind of
convinced me. And I feel more vulnerable when I fight toe-to-toe. I
can make it much easier on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Easy fight? Alcazar believes he knows how the fight is
going to go.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad is going to attack De La Hoya from the opening bell
and, as with Rafael Ruelas in 1995, will be cut down as a result.
It will be as if he'll walk willingly into a meat grinder.
</P>
<P>
   Most significant, Alcazar has been very critical of Trinidad's
footwork, which he said leaves him off-balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be his biggest mistake,'' Alcazar said of
Trinidad's aggressiveness. ``. &UR;  &LR; . &UR;  &LR; . &UR;  &LR;  We all know that Trinidad
has the reputation of being cold the first three, four rounds. He
gets knocked down in almost every, single (important) fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is he's not going to get up when Oscar hits
him.''
</P>
<P>
   And what if Trinidad !ital!doesn't come right at De La Hoya?
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened against Quartey, who was expected to attack
but waited much of the fight for De La Hoya to make the first move.
De La Hoya was unable to adjust and took the fight only when he
became aggressive in the final rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wrong,'' Alcazar said. ``Just in case, we'll be ready
this time. You learn from fight to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``. &UR;  &LR; . &UR;  &LR; . &UR;  &LR;  I don't think it will happen because (Trinidad)
doesn't have the talent to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Steward bashing: De La Hoya and Alcazar were brutally
critical of Emanuel Steward, De La Hoya's onetime trainer who has
said he believes Trinidad will win because De La Hoya has too many
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   First De La Hoya: ``He just wants to come into camp and train
me. He wants me to think, `Emanuel Steward is right. I need him so
I can be ready for this fight. He's the one criticizing me and he's
the one who knows how to train me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the case. I respected the man a lot. I'm very
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Alcazar: ``My feeling is that Emanuel is jealous. He missed
his payday, a payday he earns not with the job he does but with the
politics he uses to sneak into camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand that kind of person having a big name in
the sport of boxing. I mean, when I see that person working the gym
I say, `What? This the big name in boxing? This is the greatest
trainer? My God.' &UR;  &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable that fighter and trainer would be upset
about Steward's comments. However, the fact that Alcazar, a
relative newcomer to the sport, would criticize one of the game's
top figures is a bit ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Add Alcazar: No trainer receives more criticism than
Alcazar, a former fighter who finds himself in his position largely
because he happened to work the same job as De La Hoya's father
when the champion was an amateur.
</P>
<P>
   He has trained no one but De La Hoya and isn't considered
particularly knowledgeable.
</P>
<P>
   His reaction? He must be doing something right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results speak for themselves,'' he said. ``We've been
working together for 10 years already. I've been in his corner at
least 180 times, almost 200 times, and we've never lost a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very proud about my job, about my fighter. The record
shows no other trainer, no other manager in boxing history has
captured (an Olympic) gold medal and five world titles like I
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Then this question begs to be answered: Why have De La Hoya and
his other handlers brought in one experienced trainer after another
to work with the fighter?
</P>
<P>
   Simple: They don't have complete faith in Alcazar. At the
moment, veteran Gil Clancy supplements Alcazar's work.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bob Arum, De La Hoya's promoter, defends Alcazar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the criticism early on was justified because he wasn't
that experienced,'' he said. ``Now, he has !ital!become
experienced, he's learned from the other trainers. Now he's
competent, a very good trainer.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, one reason De La Hoya keeps Alcazar around is he
believes the trainer truly cares about him. In a business rife with
sharks, that's important.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Rabbit punches: Longtime strawweight champion Ricardo
Lopez, one of the best pound-for-pound fighters, will move up in
weight to challenge IBF junior flyweight champ Will Grigsby on Oct.
2.
</P>
<P>
   In the co-feature, Julio Cesar Chavez, 37, will face veteran
Willy Wise in a 10-round junior welterweight bout.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez rebounded from his second loss to De La Hoya by stopping
journeyman Verdell Smith in April.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson was scheduled to make his return to boxing on Oct. 2.
However, that date has been moved back for lack of an
opponent. &UR;  &LR; . &UR;  &LR; . &UR;  &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Unbeaten heavyweight Lawrence Clay-Bey, a member of the 1996
U.S. Olympic team, returns to boxing to face Dale Crowe on Aug. 28
in Las Vegas after a 16-month layoff.
</P>
<P>
   Clay-Bey hasn't fought since April of 1998 because of a broken
hand that required surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The fight is on the undercard of the David Reid-Keith Mullings
matchup.

 &HT;    Gordon rolls to 5 in row on road
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATKINS GLEN, N.Y. _ Maybe they ought to remove Winston Cup
races from these funky road courses, as stock car purists suggest;
no one but Jeff Gordon can win them, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon won his fifth straight road course race Sunday at Watkins
Glen International and his third in a row at this ancient track.
</P>
<P>
   He led four times for 55 of the 90 laps in the Frontier at the
Glen, including the last 20. He beat the surprising Ron Fellows,
driving a Chevrolet owned by Cup driver Joe Nemechek, by .763
seconds to win $119,860.
</P>
<P>
   Pole-sitter Rusty Wallace was a distant third and points leader
Dale Jarrett finished fourth. Jarrett holds a 300-point lead over
Mark Martin, the last NASCAR driver other than Gordon to win a road
race (Sears Point in June 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett is 482 points ahead of the fifth-place Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   But he was way behind him Sunday at the Glen. Gordon, starting
from the No. 3 spot, was practically flawless over the 220.5 miles.
He led laps 2-20, 32-33, 45-55 and the decisive final 20.
</P>
<P>
   Giving up track position to Wallace a third of the way into the
race was no big problem to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was based on common sense,'' Gordon said, explaining that
another car had dropped oil on the track at the time. ``You see
something shiny and wet on the race track, it's not worth it. Rusty
was pushing me really hard at that time and it just wasn't worth it
for me to push that hard when I see fluid on the track, all the way
around for two laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there was going to be a caution. I just didn't know
when. He was willing to take that chance so I said, `hey, go
ahead.' My car was really good. I didn't want to give up the lead,
but I said it just wasn't worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a bit more effort to hold off Fellows, who has much
experience on this track in the Trans-Am series. A caution with
five laps to go, when Johnny Benson slammed a wall, bunched things
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to get a good restart,'' Gordon said. ``In some
areas, Ron was better than I was. Coming off the _ I don't know,
you've got me confused with the turns here. Some are saying 7, some
are saying 11. I count seven, so I would call that (turn) 5, the
carousel up there. He was stronger than I was off that turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew if he got close to me in that area, he could make a
pass. If he made a pass on me, it was going to be very tough for me
to get back by him, even though my overall lap times were a little
bit faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Fellows seemed willing to accept the compliments but
he felt second-place was bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure tomorrow I'll feel better with second place,'' said
Fellows, who led laps 56-58. ``I wanted to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But he admitted in the last frantic laps he was awestruck just
being behind Gordon and headed for the checkered flag. ``I was
thinking `how can I get around him,' '' Fellows said, ``and I was
also thinking, `man, this is pretty unbelievable. Me, running
behind Jeff Gordon.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The only other time I thought about (who I was racing) was
early, when I passed Dale Earnhardt. I thought that was pretty
cool. He may have been weaving just to let me go, but I gave a wave
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   He was willing to admit that finishing second in a Winston Cup
race was his biggest racing accomplishment. ``I hope it's my
biggest payday,'' Fellows said. It probably is: second place paid
$67,270.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's the absolute best Cup driver on road courses,
Gordon can appreciate where he's come from.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not hard for me to go back just three or four years ago
when a good race for me was if I stayed on the race track and
didn't miss a shift,'' Gordon said. ``Or I should say didn't miss
five shifts.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory continued a hit-and-miss season for Gordon. It was
his fifth win of the season, his 14th top 10 finish in 21 races and
moves him into 12th place on the all-time winner's list with 47. He
leads Cup drivers this year in wins, road wins and money earned
($4,289,101). But because five DNFs will probably cost him the
championship, many see it as an off year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the perception of other people, not us,'' Gordon said.
``We know that every season isn't going to be a season like we had
last year. At the end of the year, if we're not the champion, we're
going to feel like we didn't accomplish our goals. At the same
time, it's hard to took at this season so far and say it's been a
disaster. It just hasn't been as good as last year.''

<P>
   For the last three months, Martin R. Frankel, a sometimes clumsy
fugitive who fled the United States with cases of computers and an
entourage of traveling companions, has managed to evade an
international manhunt by some of the world's most sophisticated law
enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel, who federal investigators suspect of stealing as much
as $350 million from U.S. insurance companies, spent the first
weeks of summer hiding in plain sight in Rome, strolling along the
Villa Borghese park on brilliant afternoons and sipping espresso in
open-air cafes.
</P>
<P>
   His was not a low-profile exile. According to associates and one
of the women who was with him, he risked exposure by repeatedly
phoning friends in the United States and by relying for help on
people known to have had associations with him in the past. Six
weeks after arriving in Rome, he arranged for another young female
friend to fly from America to join him.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a 177-nation Interpol alert, Frankel has lived openly in
Italy and has visited Spain and possibly France, juggling aliases
and bank accounts faster than courts can seize his money. He is
believed to have left Rome in early July, and American authorities
acknowledge that the trail has gone cold. For now, the financier's
hastily arranged but oddly successful flight appears to be an
instance in which the cooperation among the world's national police
forces is more impressive in theory than it is in practice.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the American pursuit of Frankel complained that
European authorities have not helped matters. In Italy, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, which at one time in early July felt it
had a fix on Frankel's location, waited days to get an arrest
warrant issued by local magistrates. Frankel had moved on. Italian
law enforcement officials declined to comment on the Frankel case.
</P>
<P>
   But while he has kept a step ahead of police, Frankel seems to
have found life on the lam a source of constant complaints. Mona
Kim, an American confidante of Frankel who traveled with him to
Italy, and others who followed his trail, relate a tale of a
spoiled, fearful man with no evident talent for international
intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   The reedy, bespectacled 44-year-old, who often secluded himself
in his Greenwich, Conn., home, spoke no Italian, and could not call
a taxi on his own. A notoriously fussy eater, he told traveling
companions he could not abide pasta and sent them around Rome for
Chinese take-out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was terrified that everybody was going to hurt him,'' Ms.
Kim said. ``He needed a lot of comforting and nurturing. He really
just hated the place so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Prone to pitiful mistakes, worthy of ``The Pink Panther's''
Inspector Clouseau, Frankel relied more on good luck than careful
planning to keep him out of trouble. On at least one occasion, he
stumbled into a situation that might have led to his arrest but
bluffed his way to safety. He also almost fell into a trap set by a
British tabloid which may have come close to capturing Frankel on
its own.
</P>
<P>
   National police forces have historically had a difficult time
collaborating on international cases that involve complex financial
dealings. But Frankel's success in avoiding capture in Italy, a
nation with which the United States has an extradition treaty and a
history of cooperation on drug and Mafia cases, is noteworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities still hope that Frankel might use up his money, make
more mistakes, even turn himself in. But it is also possible that
he will join a long list of fugitive financiers who have
embarrassed the police with their maneuvers abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Vesco, accused of looting $225 million from an investment
fund in 1973, escaped an indictment in the United States for years
before running into new troubles in Cuba. Marc Rich, wanted in the
United States for evading nearly $50 million in taxes, lives openly
in Switzerland, where tax crimes are not grounds for extradition.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years of living luxuriously in the back country of
Greenwich, spending what federal prosecutors say were insurance
company assets that he was supposed to be investing, Frankel began
to talk in April about fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   During a trip to Jackson, Miss., he had failed to fend off
Mississippi state regulators who had grown suspicious about his
operation. Angst ridden, he told friends he was debating whether to
fight the regulators or flee, possibly going abroad long enough to
``let the smoke clear,'' as Ms. Kim remembers it.
</P>
<P>
   Around this time, Frankel ordered $10 million in diamonds.
Workers in his home office say they began shredding mountains of
documents at his request. Then, on the morning of May 4, Frankel,
appearing for work in his usual uniform of baggy Levis jeans and a
white Oxford shirt, told Ms. Kim and Jackie Ju, two office workers
he considered close friends, that he would leave later that day. He
asked them to come with him, and they agreed.
</P>
<P>
   After staying with Frankel in Italy for almost two months, Ms.
Kim returned in late June to the United States, where she has
cooperated with law enforcement authorities. Ms. Ju also returned
from Italy in June, but she could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of me couldn't believe that he was going, because I think
that a few days before he was still talking about staying and maybe
fighting it,'' recalled Ms. Kim, a slim, laconic 34-year-old who
shares Frankel's passion for astrology.

A YOUTH LEAGUE'S TICKET TO THE INTERNET

<P>
   LOS ANGELES_ Northridge resident and longtime youth-sports coach
Don Rann isn't sure why a free Web site he supports called
SportsCombine.com _ a vehicle to help youth leagues, athletic
directors, coaches and league administrators make their jobs easier
and more fun _ hasn't been embraced in this part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back East, it's big, but here it's been a tough sell,''
admitted Rann, the site's California state coordinator. ``Maybe
because it takes some extra volunteer work. But there's a terrific
opportunity out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Based in Fairfax, Va., the site provides teams with a place to
build their own Web pages, maintain and update stats, post
schedules and network with other leagues and coaches. And because
it allows leagues to accept advertising, it can be a cutting-edge
source of generating more fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Rann, a retiree coaching a midget-division Pop Warner team in
Chatsworth, can be contacted via e-mail at yourstatsaol.com.
</P>
<P>
   __ The Youth Sports Network site (ysn.com), another source for
helping with sign-ups for PONY baseball (www.pony.org) and Pop
Warner football leagues, will produce Saturday's noon telecast of
the PONY World Series from its headquarters in Washington, Pa.,
that is shown on Fox Sports Net. The tournament for 13- and
14-year-olds, which began Aug. 6, can also be followed at the site.

 UNDATED: passion for astrology. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The decision to depart was abrupt _ only about $2 million of the
$10 million in diamonds had arrived by that time _ but Frankel
determined that it was an astrologically auspicious day for travel.
</P>
<P>
   He did not travel light. People present at his home that day
said it took until mid-afternoon to stuff two Tahoe sport utility
vehicles and a BMW sedan with more than a dozen pieces of luggage,
including personal computers, which Frankel decided to take with
him.
</P>
<P>
   Problems cropped up immediately. The private jet that a local
aviation company was supposed to to send pick him up at Westchester
County Airport, north of New York City, never showed up. Frankel
and Ms. Kim worked the phones to arrange a replacement. When it
arrived, Frankel spent several hours haggling with the pilots over
a flight plan, eventually settling on a stop in Spain on the way to
Rome's Ciampino Airport.
</P>
<P>
   During the flight, Frankel appeared nervous, Ms. Kim said,
chatting with the pilots in the cockpit while his two female
companions watched videos in the main cabin. The moment they landed
in Spain to refuel, Frankel hopped out to make phone calls from the
airport phone. When he returned, his face was ghostly. The diamonds
he had hoped would pay for his life in exile were missing.
</P>
<P>
   While he was over the Atlantic, several members of Frankel's
staff had clashed over who would take possession of the gems, which
were delivered by private jet to Teterboro Airport in New Jersey
from Los Angeles. There are differing accounts of what happened to
about $8 million in diamonds, with several people recounting car
chases and accusing one of Frankel's own security officers of
theft, a charge the security officer's lawyer denies. The diamonds'
whereabouts remain unclear.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that just two days after he took off from
Westchester, the FBI entered the case and investigators quickly
learned from Frankel's driver that he had left the country.
Interpol was alerted, and the hunt was on.
</P>
<P>
   But it took federal authorities several weeks to assemble enough
evidence to obtain from an American judge the sealed arrest warrant
that would allow them to seek Frankel's apprehension and
extradition from a foreign country. And though several of Frankel's
workers said they knew of his plans to go to Italy, there is no
indication that the FBI began tracking him there until late June.
</P>
<P>
   Rome was not an obvious choice for a fugitive. Notes that
Frankel left behind in Greenwich suggested that he had researched
places where the United States has trouble extraditing people,
including Brazil and Israel. Italy is not among them.
</P>
<P>
   But Frankel had one thing in Italy that he may not have had
elsewhere: friends. Fausto Fausti, a retired Italian air force
officer and aviation consultant, and his son Alfredo, a law
student, had played a shadowy role in Frankel's insurance dealings,
including efforts to persuade Catholic charities in Italy to
participate in his purchases of American insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship appears to have involved money. American
authorities have tracked wire transfers from accounts controlled by
Frankel to Fausti, including one made shortly before Frankel's
departure from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment Frankel arrived in Rome, the Faustis were host,
tour guide and booking agent, finding the fugitives places to live
and helping them when they got into trouble, said Ms. Kim and other
associates. The Faustis did not return repeated phone calls. Their
New York lawyer, Paul A. Goldberger, also failed to respond to a
reporter's queries.
</P>
<P>
   The first stop in Rome was an apartment the Faustis arranged for
Frankel in a working-class neighborhood, not far from the Hotel
Dover. But lodging became an immediate and nagging concern for
Frankel, who had lived in a nearly $4 million home on four acres in
one of American's toniest suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   When he inspected his new quarters, with its sparse furniture
and miniscule kitchen, he pronounced it ``a dump.'' There was no
telephone or television. And when the Faustis were not around, no
one in the party spoke Italian. All three struggled to memorize
enough Italian phrases to be able to tell a cab driver where they
lived. Frankel also complained about calculating prices in lire,
the Italian currency, a scrip famous for its lofty denominations.
</P>
<P>
   In his first weeks on the run, Frankel appeared to have few
worries that the Italians or Americans would track him down. Though
they did little touring, Frankel and his entourage did not hide.
Because they had no phone at the apartment, Frankel bought stacks
of phone cards and wandered the city in search of public phones.
Often, Ms. Kim and Ms. Ju sat languidly for hours in outdoor cafes
while Frankel called business associates around the world.
</P>
<P>
   They had easy access to cash. Ms. Kim said she opened an account
in her own name at the Banca Popolare di Brescia in the nearby
Piazza Giuseppe Verdi. In one trans-Atlantic phone call in late
May, Frankel arranged for his diamond dealer to deposit a $450,000
sales-tax refund in that account, which Ms. Kim then drew on for
living expenses.

UNDATED: living expenses.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the weeks passed, with still no signs of media attention or
heat from law enforcement, Frankel felt secure enough to find
plusher accommodations. Scouring English-language guide books, he
found a small hotel in an upscale district near the elegant Villa
Borghese park and museum. Frankel rented a suite, and promptly
demanded hard-back chairs to replace the ultra-modern benches in
the room, which he found uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel choice seemed risky from the start. Ms. Kim noticed
that it was near the embassy district and not far from the
well-guarded Israeli mission. ``It had surveillance up the
ying-yang,'' Ms. Kim recalled. Sure enough, at midnight on May 25,
their sense of security was shattered by a knock on the door.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kim, sitting in the living room with Ms. Ju while Frankel
slept, opened the door. The hotel owner demanded to see their
passports, said Ms. Kim. He said that the Israeli Embassy had
contacted the local police chief, who in turn had contacted him.
The problem was that the Frankel party, using an assumed name, had
checked in to the hotel without presenting their passports, a
breach of protocol and security. (Officials in the Israel Embassy
said they recalled no such incident.)
</P>
<P>
   Near panic ensued. Leaving the manager in the hall, Ms. Kim woke
up Frankel. He ordered her not to show the passports. Ms. Kim
returned to the door with an improvised story: that because she
could not figure out how to work the safe in the room, she had
placed their passports in the safe deposit box of a nearby bank and
could not retrieve them until the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, Frankel burst out of his bedroom and yelled at the
owner: ``Do you have any idea what time it is? I paid good money
for this villa. You have no right to come here at this hour.'' He
told the owner to return at 10 a.m. to see their passports.
</P>
<P>
   The ruse worked. Stammering apologies, the embarrassed owner
invited them to lunch the next day. He even spent 20 minutes
showing them how to work the safe. At dawn, with the help of a
bellhop, they loaded their suitcases into several cabs and escaped
to the Faustis, who arranged a new place of refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Home for the next five weeks was a pale green apartment building
on Via Asmara in Trieste, an upper middle-class section of Rome.
Here, in an apartment owned by a person Ms. Kim describes as a
Fausti friend, Frankel had more of the comforts of home. But
Frankel was growing fearful for his safety.
</P>
<P>
   At a neighborhood cafe that offered access to the Internet,
Frankel began scanning Web sites to keep up on the news. In early
June, his once buoyant optimism that he could fade anonymously into
well-heeled exile ended when he saw the first wire-service
references to an FBI investigation into his business.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, newspapers were carrying detailed accounts of an
international insurance fraud. One article about him in the Toledo
Blade, his Toledo, Ohio, hometown newspaper, caused him particular
anguish.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking of family members who would read the article, Frankel
curled up on the apartment sofa. ``My poor mother,'' he lamented.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel's use of aliases and his practice of scattering his
assets prevented the police from locking up all his bank accounts
even by mid-August. But by the end of May, the FBI began to win
court seizure orders on some of his accounts. And he began to get
nervous.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of the Faustis, he converted some cash into gold,
said one person involved in Frankel's dealings. It was not a
brilliant tactic for a man on the run: The gold bars were too heavy
to move, forcing him to summon help when he needed to change his
address.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-June, Frankel also began to explore safer options for
exile. He sought advice from a Rome-based lawyer, Pierre Fortin.
Fortin did not return phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel also took a trip to Milan, where he consulted with an
extradition expert, people familiar with his travels said. He even
met a friend of the son of Moammar Gadhafi, the Libyan leader, to
ask for protection from that historically anti-American government,
though no deal was reached.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his fears, he kept an open line to his friends. Ms. Ju
began to tire of life on the run in mid-June and insisted on
returning home. Frankel, afraid of being alone, began phoning other
friends back in the United States. At least three former employees
of Frankel received calls from him during this period. It's not
known whether the FBI was monitoring their telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel found at least one new recruit: Cynthia Allison, a
former staff member, flew to Italy to join him, several people
said. On June 26, after Ms. Allison's arrival, Ms. Kim also
returned home. One person close to the investigation said Frankel
gave her a $20,000 parting gift, though Ms. Kim's lawyer, Keith
Rubenstein, declined to comment on that matter. Ms. Allison is
believed to be with Frankel to this day.
</P>
<P>
   The closest Frankel has come to capture in his time abroad might
have been a sting operation. But it was arranged by a British
tabloid, The Express, not by the police.
</P>
<P>
   In early July, The Express solicited the help of Thomas J.
Corbally, an elderly American business consultant and private
detective who was instrumental in Frankel's dealings. Corbally, who
in June and July was living in a luxury hotel in London and putting
off an FBI demand for an interview, has said that he is a friend of
Fausti.
</P>
<P>
   The Express reported that through London intermediaries it made
contact with Frankel, agreeing to lease him a private jet that
would fly him to northern Cyprus, a country considered a safe haven
for fugitives. Although some details of the newspaper account
appear to be inaccurate, several people involved said they believed
the outlines of it to be true. Corbally and his lawyer declined to
return phone calls in recent weeks. But people close to Corbally
said they believe that he did play a role in the newspaper sting.
</P>
<P>
   Had Frankel boarded the plane as arranged, The Express said that
it would have delivered him to the police. But the plan fell
through. Frankel phoned a day before the scheduled departure to
postpone. His reason: He had studied astrological charts and
divined that the stars were not properly aligned for travel that
day.

 &HT;    NASCAR NOTEBOOK: Dream run ends for rookie Said
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATKINS GLEN, N.Y. _ For nearly half of the race's 90 laps,
Boris Said was playing out a rookie's dream at Watkins Glen
International.
</P>
<P>
   Starting second after a glorious qualifying run in the No. 14
Ford co-owned by Ernie Irvan, Said was proving he belonged up among
the front-runners in the Frontier at the Glen.
</P>
<P>
   He led laps 21-29, only losing track position when he pitted on
lap 31. Then the engine failed on lap 48 and he retired for the
day, placing next-to-last in the 43-car field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my wife's birthday and I wanted to give her a special
present, but, sorry, Karen,'' Said said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot of fun leading, and it was a lot of fun running
with Jeff Gordon,'' he said. ``I know why that guy's fast now. He's
so smooth. He's an awesome driver. It was fun being out there with
those guys.
</P>
<P>
   Said, a regular road-course and occasional truck-series driver,
is the first driver to lead a lap in his first Winston Cup race
since Kenny Irwin did it at Richmond in September 1997. Said was
the 38th different driver to lead a lap this season.
</P>
<P>
   And he finished just behind his boss, Irvan, whose engine also
failed in the No. 36 Pontiac after 60 laps. But the rookie said
he'll be in Michigan next weekend, even if he's not in a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm Ernie's spiritual advisor for the Busch car,'' Said
said. ``So I've got to go out there, light incense and chant and
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   A sorry 600th
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt called his 600th consecutive start ``pretty
sorry'' and said ``it isn't one I want to remember.'' He started
14th in the Frontier at the Glen and finished 20th, but what
happened in between made the day even more forgettable.
</P>
<P>
   On lap 16, he bumped into teammate Mike Skinner and dented both
cars. And on the last lap, he went deep into the last corner to
avoid Darrell Waltrip and ended up against the wall, showering the
track with pieces of the Styrofoam padding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got into the back of Skinner,'' Earnhardt said. ``That ain't
too hard to do here.'' Skinner's explanation was just as sketchy.
``We were just racing real hard and got turned around down there,''
Skinner said. ``I don't know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Just racing
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nemechek and Bill Elliott got into a last-lap accident on
the way to the finish line and Nemechek was not too happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove my car in way too deep (into the last turn) and here
comes Bill Elliott and I knew there was no way he was going to make
it,'' Nemechek said. ``I still had to go around the corner or else
get penalized. When he runs into my back tire, it's kind of stupid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame. We were running eighth and ended up 38th or
something (actually, 30th). I'm still kind of hot right now, but
I'll cool down. We'll be friends again tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's explanation: ``We were just racing. I got inside of
Joe and we got together, hard enough that I had to finish with a
flat left-front tire. We went from ninth to 20th, but that's just
last-lap racing sometimes.''

IOWA VOTE EXPOSES WILD CARD FOR BUSH JUGGERNAUT: STEVE FORBES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to fix last sentence, `seven out of every 10
participants,' sted `seven of the 10.') 
 (nk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMES, Iowa _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush did not merely want to
place first in the straw poll here on Saturday of Republican
presidential contenders. He wanted, as one of his advisers put it
Sunday, ``to absolutely smash everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why even members of the governor's high command were
personally, and frantically, prodding people to cast their ballots
in the final minutes of voting.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was decisive but hardly a rout. Bush won with 31
percent, and his aides boasted that he amassed 7,418 of the 23,685
votes cast, three times more than any victor in the event's
two-decade history. But his two closest competitors _ Steve Forbes,
who drew 21 percent, and Elizabeth Dole, with 14 percent _ also
turned out more people than any past winner. And seven out of every
10 participants voted for someone other than Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The voting here at Iowa State University did not alter the basic
story line of the Republican presidential race: Bush is still the
towering front-runner. Yet while Bush entered the competition here
only two months ago, the results underscored that his course to the
nomination may be turbulent. And they suggested that he will face
forceful, and perhaps damaging, challenges in the crucial
nominating caucuses here in six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are candidates who will be strong and competitive in
January and February,'' Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's advisers were most unsettled by Forbes, the
multimillionaire magazine publisher who has lavished his fortune on
the presidential race and spent far more money on the straw poll
than Bush.
</P>
<P>
   There was never any doubt that Forbes' wealth would give him the
opportunity to spar with Bush throughout the primaries. That, in
fact, is what drove Bush to join Forbes in rejecting federal
matching funds so he is not encumbered by spending limits. But
Forbes demonstrated on Saturday that he knows how to convert his
money into an organization that is adroit at turning people out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely wanted to do better,'' said a Bush adviser who
spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``But there was one thing we
couldn't control: How many votes Mr. Forbes could buy.'' The
adviser went on, ``We have a wild card in this race: Steve Forbes.
The danger is, he could come in and carpet bomb and force us to
spend five, six or seven million dollars just to win the Iowa
caucuses.''
</P>
<P>
   While the straw poll was designed as a fund-raiser for the state
Republican Party, and the candidates' paid the $25 entry fee for
participants, it was also an organizational test that will affect
the candidates' fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Because Gary Bauer, the former head of the Family Research
Council, finished fourth place, ahead of conservative commentator
Pat Buchanan, Bauer is portraying himself as the standard bearer of
religious conservatives. Buchanan has hinted that he might consider
bolting the Republicans to try for the nomination of the Reform
Party.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the straw poll, Buchanan said that Bush was so far
ahead in the polls that the governor's campaign felt the ``need to
blow them all out and end it right here.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush fell short of that goal, the outcome does significantly
diminish the fortunes of former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and
former Vice President Dan Quayle. Alexander, who had devoted more
time to campaigning in Iowa than any other candidate, is expected
to suspend his campaign, perhaps as soon as Monday. He ranked sixth
place, with 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a powerful force in this country to nominate George W.
Bush,'' Alexander said Sunday on the NBC News program ``Meet the
Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, already stumping in New Hampshire on Sunday, insisted he
would soldier on, despite being humiliated with an eighth place
finish of 3.9 percent, behind Alan Keyes, a radio host.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, who entered the presidential contest
last month, placed ninth, followed by Sen. John McCain of Arizona,
who did not campaign here and scoffed at the straw poll as ``a sham
and a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the outcome was not as convincing as other, earlier
gauges of his success: a war chest that is 10 times that of his
nearest competitors and polls showing him swamping his rivals. And
in his first side-by-side performance with his rivals in the hall
here on Saturday, Bush did not electrify the crowd _ certainly not
enough to convince people to abandon other contenders in droves.
</P>
<P>
   The hope in the Bush camp is that Republicans will ultimately
stick with him because he looks like a winner and appears to have
the strongest chance to defeat the Democrats in a general election.
He enjoys deep institutional support of money and endorsements and
there is no obvious alternative. Bush's supporters are buoyed by
the fact that the second-, third-, fourth- and fifth-place
finishers have never been elected to public office.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Gov. John Engler, who was here on behalf of Bush, said
of Forbes' inheritance: ``His fund-raising is easy. All he has to
do is have a meeting of the brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   But, turning serious, he adding, ``He's dangerous because he has
money. He's less dangerous because he has no electoral record.''
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes made the case that his showing on Saturday proves
that he is electable. ``Money plus no message equals mush,'' he
said. ``Voters want real substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, the former president of the American Red Cross, benefited
from drawing women and young people to the events, what she called
``an invisible army.'' But Bush's advisers insisted that they
preferred that Dole placed third rather than, say, Bauer. They
expressed concern that if a favorite of religious conservatives was
catapulted to the top tier _ as happened with Buchanan in the New
Hampshire primary in 1996 _ that candidate could prove nettlesome
for months.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign that is probably eyeing Dole the closest is
McCain's. His advisers said Dole could complicate their plan to
emerge as a logical alternative to Bush because she competes for
some of the same support. Making her pitch Sunday, Dole noted that
she spent far less here than the first- and second-place finishers.
</P>
<P>
   The hope among her followers, and the other candidates, is that
Forbes' wealth will alienate voters. As Forbes addressed the hall
Saturday night, several strategists for other candidates looked on
with delight. He had financed a costly balloon drop when he reached
the lectern. But rival camps immediately began popping the
balloons. The noise drowned out most of Forbes' speech.

 &HT;    Beloved Atlanta Journal-Constitution columnist Celestine Sibley
dies of cancer
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS and SIDEBARS
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Celestine Sibley, whose column ran in The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution for 55 years, died early Sunday morning at her
summer retreat on Dog Island, Fla. She was 85. She had undergone
surgery for breast cancer in 1995 and suffered a heart attack in
1998. She learned that her cancer had returned late last year.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best loved and most prolific writers in the history
of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Sibley captured everyday life
in the changing South in more than 10,000 columns since 1944.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celestine was one of the true giants,'' said Georgia Gov. Roy
Barnes. ``She had one of the biggest hearts of any person that I
ever knew. She knew the secrets on all of us in the General
Assembly, and we were comfortable that she knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Ashmead, Sibley's editor at Harper Collins, said, ``A
light's gone out in Atlanta and Georgia and all over the South,
where people read her and loved her.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Ashmead, ``I'm sort of glad she died on Dog Island, the
place she and Jack (her late husband Jack Strong) loved the most of
all the places they had.''
</P>
<P>
   Born near Pensacola, Fla., Sibley was reared in the turpentine
country north of Mobile, Ala. She came to work at The Atlanta
Constitution in 1941. Though best known for the columns that she
wrote from 1944 until shortly before her death, she was a star
court reporter and also covered politics and the Georgia
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   She almost single-handedly brought up three children while
holding down a full-time job, freelancing magazine articles and
writing 25 books. Her honors and awards were many. In June she
became only the second woman ever to receive the Lifetime
Achievement Award from the National Society of Newspaper
Columnists.
</P>
<P>
   According to her daughter Mary Vance, Sibley was alert when she
died around 5:30 Sunday morning. In her last moments she asked
whether they might return to Sweet Apple one last time, explaining
that, ``There are a couple of things I wanted to do in the
garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Patricia Templeton, associate rector of St Timothy's
Episcopal Church in Signal Mountain, Tennessee, said, ``She
approached her death the way she lived her life: With courage and
grace and stubbornness.'' Templeton is to officiate at a memorial
service for her longtime friend. Plans for that service were to be
announced later today.
</P>
<P>
   Templeton served as an intern at The Atlanta Constitution in
1976, before she turned to the ministry, and still keeps a clipping
of a Sibley column from that summer. In the column, Sibley writes
of a fierce love of newspapering, saying ``I can honestly say that
there has been nothing in my life so painful and saddening that it
wasn't eased a little bit as I walked toward my job in a newspaper
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Martin, editor of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, said
Sunday, ``Those of us who were fortunate to work with her will miss
her laughter, her wisdom and her example. Her column was Celestine
herself _ an oasis, where you could share a quiet moment, recover
your perspective, and leave refreshed, ready to journey on. It's
hard to imagine the paper without her.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Cumming of Carrollton used Sibley's columns when he taught
journalism at West Georgia College, and cherished a friendship that
began in 1957 when he began reporting for Newsweek's Southern
bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always thought of her in heroic terms,'' said Cumming.
``She had all the strength of the Statue of Liberty, only with a
sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Sibley and former governor Zell Miller were friends from the
years when she covered the state legislature and he was a young
lawmaker. ``I always looked upon her as a wise aunt, who would
encourage you with warmth and gentleness,'' said Miller. ``She
taught us how to face our later years: With dignity, with humor,
and occasionally a little bit of irritability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved her very much,'' said Miller, ``and, gosh, I'm going
to miss her, but so will thousands of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include her son, James W. Little V of Alford, Fla.;
two daughters, Susan Sibley Little Bazemore of Des Moines (formerly
of Omaha) and Mary Everitt Little-Vance of Roswell; eight
grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of flowers, the family asks that contributions be sent
to the library of their choice or to Trees Atlanta.

   ``We sang when she got her Atlanta Gas Light `Shining Light
Award' (in 1997) at the newspaper. Afterward, she cornered me and
made me promise that the choir would sing at her funeral. She told
me she wanted us to sing spirituals, especially her favorite,
`Steal Away.' I told her, `Of course we will.' Her response to me
was, `Oh, I believe I'll go home and die tonight!'

   ``It's a sad day for Georgia. She was a great neighbor and a
great friend for over 30 years. If she got busy up there at Sweet
Apple, she just wouldn't bother to answer the phone. When the folks
at the newspaper really needed to talk to her, they'd call the
store and ask if I could go up and tell her. And when I got there,
nine out of ten times, she'd have something for me to do!''

readers. Over the 23 years she signed at our store, I saw readers
bring her homemade jams and jellies and pictures, everything. She
took the time to talk to each and every person in that line, no
matter how long it took. People would stand in line for two or
three hours and not care one bit. ``

   ``When I started collecting her books, I was working at the
First National Bank on Marietta Street, right down from the paper.
Her first book, `The Malignant Heart' had eluded me for years. When
I finally found a copy in 1981, I called her up and asked if she
would sign it for me. I remember her saying, `Sure honey, come on
over.' This was in the days before security and all that. I walked
into her office to find a mound of papers that looked like a
mini-Stone Mountain. I called out her name and this head popped up
from the pile of papers. That's when I saw the piece of marble with
`Bless This Mess' on it. She inscribed my book with `Noel, you are
a wonder! Imagine the trouble and pain you went through trying to
get this one! With grateful appreciation and love, Celestine
Sibley.''

would sign it for me. I remember her saying, `Sure honey, come on
over.' This was in the days before security and all that. I walked
into her office to find a mound of papers that looked like a
mini-Stone Mountain. I called out her name and this head popped up
from the pile of papers. That's when I saw the piece of marble with
`Bless This Mess' on it. She inscribed my book with `Noel, you are

get this one! With grateful appreciation and love, Celestine

FURROW ACQUIRED WEAPONS TO FURTHER HIS HATE AGENDA
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The violent path of Buford O. Furrow Jr., the white supremacist
who wounded five people last week at a Jewish community center in
Los Angeles and killed a letter carrier there, highlights another
aspect of the nation's guns laws: members of hate groups, even
those that espouse attacking others, can legally buy firearms or
become, as Furrow did, a licensed firearms dealer.
</P>
<P>
   It now appears that Furrow, who belonged to the Aryan Nations, a
neo-Nazi group, and was apparently a follower of other hate groups,
legally acquired some, if not many, of the weapons that he carried
in the Los Angeles shootings prior to his arrest last October. At
that time, he pleaded guilty to assault following an attack on a
nurse at a Washington state psychiatric hospital where he had gone
to seek admission, saying that he was having fantasies of
committing a mass killing.
</P>
<P>
   It was only following his release from jail in May that Furrow,
as a convicted felon, was barred from owning firearms, though
Washington state parole officials apparently never checked to see
whether he did. Between 1992 and 1995, the period when Furrow
belonged to the Aryan Nations, he was a federally licensed firearms
dealer, a position that allowed him to buy guns and ammunition from
distributors at a discount. He was subsequently associated with a
number of hate groups.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Roehm, a spokesman with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms, the federal agency that regulates the sale of guns,
said that federal officials did not know how many weapons Furrow
bought when he had a dealer's license. But Roehm said that a
membership in an organization, even those espousing racial
violence, does not prevent a person from legally buying guns or
becoming a dealer. Along with convicted felons, those barred from
gun ownership include illegal aliens, users of illegal drugs, those
convicted of domestic assault and those determined by a court to be
mentally defective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Membership in an organization has never been a crime,'' Roehm
said.
</P>
<P>
   David McGee, the owner of the Loaner, Too, pawnshop in Everett,
a city about 25 miles north of Seattle, said in a telephone
interview that Furrow took out loans on guns he pawned eight times
from April to September 1998. In at least one case, McGee said,
Furrow bought guns into the pawnshop in the morning to get a loan
and then returned later the same day to redeem the loan and get his
guns back. One gun involved in that loan was a Glock 9 mm
semiautomatic pistol that Furrow used to shoot and kill Joseph
Santos Ileto, a letter carrier, because he was a ``nonwhite.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times reported on Saturday that unidentified
federal and state officials had told the newspaper that Furrow had
used a Chinese-made Norinco 9 mm semiautomatic rifle in his attack
on the Jewish community center in Granada Hills. Officials had said
earlier in court papers that the weapon involved was an Uzi.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Chester, an ATF spokesman in Seattle, said in a interview
on Friday that there were ``indications'' that Furrow had acquired
some of the weapons found in the arsenal he brought to Los Angeles
in trades after his release from jail in May.

 Consumer Price Index for July could add to interest-rate jitters  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those jittery about further interest-rate boosts by the Federal
Reserve are likely to have their anxiety heightened by the July
reading of the {Consumer Price Index,} which will be reported
Tuesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The consensus call is for a rise of 0.3 percent in the general
price level as measured by the index. An increase that large would
be even more shocking because the index has remained unchanged for
the past two months. This lull has been used as a talking point by
those lobbying Fed policy-makers in hopes of heading off another
rate increase. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The mitigating factor, if the consensus is accurate, will be
only a modest increase in the core rate, which excludes the
volatile food and energy components from the inflation measure. &QL; 
Tuesday &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The latest numbers on {industrial production} and {plant
capacity in use} are forecast to show a reasonably healthy
manufacturing sector, but certainly not one in danger of creating
inflationary bottlenecks. Most analysts expect factory output to
have expanded 0.3 percent while the amount of productive capacity
in use remained unchanged at 80.3 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - The July rate of {housing starts} is likely to reflect the
industry's modest slowdown, which is generally attributed to rising
mortgage rates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - The Treasury has scheduled {an auction of 52-week bills.} &QL; 
Thursday &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another huge {international trade deficit} is being projected
for June, but it's not expected to surpass May's record $21.3
billion shortfall. Most analysts look for $20.5 billion worth of
red ink. If the experts are on target it would bring the second
quarter's trade deficit to more than $60 billion. Although some
observers will put a negative spin on this development, the
burgeoning shortfalls are due more to U.S. economic health combined
with efforts by U.S. trading partners to revive their ailing
economies. &QL; 
Friday &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The latest {Treasury report} is expected to show a budget
deficit for July, but not enough to jeopardize expectations for a
three-digit budget surplus for fiscal 1999, which ends Sept. 30.
June's $53.6 billion in black ink brought the surplus for the first
three quarters of the fiscal year to $94 billion. The July
shortfall is expected to pare $20 billion to $25 billion from the
accumulated surplus. &QL;

 Clinton to deliver first speech to VFW convention  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Having successfully concluded a conflict with
Yugoslavia, President Clinton comes to Kansas City today to mark
the 100th anniversary of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His first appearance before a full convention of the VFW _ he
spoke to a smaller legislative conference of the group in 1995 _
has been greeted with scattered protests by some veterans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the first chief executive to emerge from the Vietnam
War generation, has been criticized by some as a draft-dodger who
has diminished the office of commander-in-chief. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the VFW administration, as it does with every president
every year, invited Clinton. And officials from the organization
said they expect his speech to be well-attended. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's usually a somewhat bigger audience when the president
is speaking,'' said Bill Smith, the VFW's director of
communications and public affairs. ``We certainly would hope that
he would address veterans health care, long-term nursing care and
national security.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to deliver the speech at 11 a.m. at Bartle
Hall. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 30,000 people are expected to come to Kansas City in the
course of the convention. The organization's members number about
1.9 million, and some 10,000 delegates and members are expected to
attend the convention. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the opening session today, which is closed to the
public but will be aired on C-Span later in the day, typically
draws 5,000 to 8,000 members. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the president has not spoken at previous
VFW conventions because of scheduling conflicts. Presidential
attendance at the largest meeting of the country's second-largest
veterans organization has been sporadic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon, a Navy veteran, attended in 1973. Jimmy Carter, a
Navy veteran, never showed. Ronald Reagan, an Army veteran, spoke
to the VFW convention during his Defense Department buildup in 1983
and 1984. George Bush, a former Navy pilot and VFW member,
addressed the convention four times _ twice as vice president and
twice while president. Vice President Al Gore, a Vietnam Army
veteran and VFW member, came in 1996. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The president thought it was important to recognize the 100th
anniversary of this important organization,'' said Elizabeth Newman
of the White House press office. ``President Clinton feels it's
very important to recognize people who have sacrificed for their
country.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, the president visited Whiteman Air Force
Base to thank the nation's military personnel for their successful
campaign with NATO against Yugoslavia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although he was of draft age during the Vietnam War, Clinton was
never called to service. ``I didn't want to be drafted,'' he said
during his 1992 campaign. ``I tried to get out of it.'' Criticism
of his efforts to avoid the draft nearly derailed his efforts to
become president, but he has denied acting dishonestly to dodge the
draft. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smith said about 150 complaints about Clinton's appearance have
come to VFW offices in Kansas City by telephone, fax and e-mail in
the past month. None, he said, preceded VFW commander-in-chief
Thomas Pouliot's invitation to the president. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Kenny Rogers concert and patriotic VFW rally is scheduled for
5:30 tonight. Sen. John McCain, a presidential candidate who was a
prisoner of war during the Vietnam War, is scheduled to speak to
the veterans on Wednesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The headquarters of the organization have been at Broadway and
34th Street in Kansas City since 1930, but the VFW hasn't brought
its annual convention to Kansas City since 1931. &QL;

during his 1992 campaign. ``I tried to get out of it.'' Criticism
of his efforts to avoid the draft nearly derailed his efforts to
become president, but he has denied acting dishonestly to dodge the
draft. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smith said about 150 complaints about Clinton's appearance have
come to VFW offices in Kansas City by telephone, fax and e-mail in
the past month. None, he said, preceded VFW commander-in-chief
Thomas Pouliot's invitation to the president. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Kenny Rogers concert and patriotic VFW rally is scheduled for
5:30 tonight. Sen. John McCain, a presidential candidate who was a
prisoner of war during the Vietnam War, is scheduled to speak to
the veterans on Wednesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The headquarters of the organization have been at Broadway and
34th Street in Kansas City since 1930, but the VFW hasn't brought
its annual convention to Kansas City since 1931. &QL;

WOODS TAKES SECOND MAJOR TITLE BY STROKE OVER WORLD'S NO. 1
TEEN-AGER 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ The century's last major was one of the best. It
was won by the world's No. 1 player, who was pursued by the world's
No. 1 teen &UR; - &LR; ager _ two electrifying talents combining for a
fantastic finish that could be the first chapter of a great
rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Faltering on the back nine, yet keeping his composure when it
counted the most, Tiger Woods won his second major at the age of
23, prevailing by one stroke over Sergio Garcia of Spain to win the
PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Woods shot an even par 72 Sunday to finish 11-under par for the
tournament (277), one stroke better than Garcia (278), who shot a
71, and almost won his first major at the age of 19. Stewart Cink
and Jay Haas finished tied for third at 8- under par, while Nick
Price faded after a sizzling front nine to finish fifth (7-under
par).
</P>
<P>
   But the battle between Woods and Garcia was riveting until the
final hole, a glimpse of golf's future, as two magnetic
personalities captivated the gallery of 45,000 at Medinah Country
Club, with fans cheered and sighed with every swing in momentum.
</P>
<P>
   It was magnificent theater, as Garcia hit incredible recovery
shots, while Woods went forward with determination, his game face
on, his eye on the ultimate prize. Since winning the 1997 Masters
by a record-setting 12 strokes, Woods has contended in other
majors, but something, or someone, always kept him from winning.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Woods sensed that this was the right time and the right
golf course, and while he was severely tested, he passed in the
end. After his tournament-clinching tap-in at No. 18 fell in the
hole, Woods' knees buckled and he sighed in relief, finally able to
exhale.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia thrilled the gallery, But Woods left with the glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get No. 2 is definitely a relief,'' said Woods, referring
to his second major championship, which brought with it a winner's
check worth $630,000. ``I've been trying. I've given myself
chances. I've come close. Sometimes you just need a little bit of
luck to go your way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played well, but I also had a few lucky breaks go my way.
Sergio played a wonderful round of golf and he needs to be
commended, not only for the way he played, but the way he conducted
himself. He was emotional. He was fiery. He was trying. He never
dogged it. It was wonderful to see.''
</P>
<P>
   For Garcia, it was his biggest coming-out party yet on the world
stage, as he became the youngest runner-up in PGA Championship
history, and almost won a major before anyone had a right to
expect. But for Garcia, this was only a beginning. His second-place
finish clinched his spot on the European Ryder Cup team, and it
also clinched his PGA Tour card for next year, if he decides to
play in the United States instead of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The fans at Medinah fell in love with Garcia, chanting ``Sergio,
Sergio'' on the back nine, and cheering for him more loudly than
they cheered for Woods.
</P>
<P>
   With Garcia, what's not to love? Since turning professional
after being low amateur at the Masters in April, Garcia has already
won the Murphy's Irish Open, while finishing second at Loch Lomond,
and third at the GTE Byron Nelson Classic.
</P>
<P>
   He plays daringly, he connects with the crowd and his golf game
isn't bad either. He ended the day not demoralized, but uplifted,
looking forward to other majors, and to other encounters with
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowds were amazing,'' said Garcia, who will never forget
his first PGA Championship. ``I said when I turned pro that I
wanted to be the No. 1 golfer in the world. So I knew I was going
to be a rival for Tiger. But I said I always wanted to be a rival
being friends, like we did today. Nineteen years old and months
since I turned pro, you can't ask for any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods certainly wouldn't ask for any more, as he saw a
comfortable lead all but disappear on the back nine. He started the
day tied with Mike Weir, a 29-year-old Canadian, who collapsed
Sunday and shot an 80 to finish tied for 10th.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Early on, everything went Woods' way. He played with poise and
precision, making birdies on four of the first seven holes, and
when he left the 11th green after another birdie, he was at
15-under par, five strokes ahead of Garcia, who was one group
ahead, and five strokes ahead of Price, who was two groups ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But faster than you could sense trouble for Woods, it came. He
three &UR; - &LR; putted for bogey at No. 12, and when he arrived at the
difficult par &UR; - &LR; 3, 219-yard No. 12, he arrived at the tee box just
in time to hear the crowd roar as Garcia made an 18-foot putt for
birdie, putting him at 11-under par, only three strokes back.
Garcia looked back at Woods, hoping to send a message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he recognized me,'' said Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum was changing, and maybe Woods felt it. His 6-iron
tee shot at No. 13 sailed over the green and into the deep rough,
leaving him with a difficult downhill chip, and Woods didn't hit a
good one. The ball rolled down the hill, past the pin, and into the
front rough, leaving him with another scary chip. Woods chipped 10
feet past the pin, then missed the putt coming back and settle for
a double-bogey as the crowd groaned. Suddenly, Woods was at
12-under par, holding just a one-stroke lead. The game was on.
</P>
<P>
   And Woods quickly sensed that many in the crowd were pulling for
Garcia. ``I could tell the crowds were changing when some guy
yelled out, `Thousand dollars you don't slice it in the water on
No. 17,''' said Woods. ``They were saying some pretty tough things.
You had to block it out and execute your golf shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia made a costly bogey on No. 15, hitting his tee shot into
the right rough. His next shot was a great one, a low liner with a
7-iron from beneath a tree that he shaped left to right and onto
the back of the green. But Garcia was left with a difficult
downhill chip, then me missed his eight-foot par attempt coming
back and settled for a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   However, Garcia's most memorable shot of the tournament came on
the next hole, when he saved par at No. 16. He hit another tee shot
into the right rough, and the ball nestled six inches from the
trunk of a tree, resting between two roots. From where Garcia
stood, 189 yards from the hole, he couldn't see the flag, but he
had a glimpse of the left side of the green. The safe play would
have been to hit a wedge into the fairway. But Garcia rarely opts
for safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine out of 10 guys on the PGA Tour would have pitched into
the fairway without even thinking,'' said Jerry Higginbotham, who
spent years caddying for Mark O'Meara, before joining Garcia
earlier this year. ``I started to tell him to pitch out, but I've
seen this kid pull off so many things, I figured I'd let him go
ahead. I can't tell you how impossible that shot was. But he did
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia took a 6-iron, closed his eyes on the downswing, but
somehow hit the ball squarely. It sailed toward the left rough,
made a sharp right turn, and flew toward the green. Garcia started
running up the hill like Carl Lewis, racing toward the green to see
if he had executed his miracle shot. He had. The ball rolled onto
the green, about 50 feet from the hole, and the gallery around the
16th green shook the ground. Garcia held his heart and bent over,
then resumed his walk to the green, where he two-parted to save par
and remain two strokes back.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, he was only a stroke behind, after Woods didn't
get up and down from the right bunker. But the tournament was
decided on then next two holes. Garcia had a chance to tie on the
par 3, 206-yard No. 17, but he missed a 15-foot birdie attempt that
broke left right away and never really had a chance. Then Woods
made a tremendous par save at No. 17, when his tee shot went long
into the rough, but he hit a delicate chip shot to eight feet, then
made one of the biggest putts of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Trust your stroke and bury it,''' said Woods.
</P>
<P>
   But Garcia wasn't done, making one last threat to tie at the
par-4 finishing hole, hitting a strong approach shot about 15 feet
below the hole. Garcia glanced back at the scoreboard and saw that
Woods was still only stroke ahead. But the putt that would have
tied rolled right of the hole, as Garcia hung his head.
</P>
<P>
   All Woods needed now at No. 18 was a par, and he got it, hitting
his approach shot to 20 feet, hitting a lag putt one foot short,
then tapping in for victory.
</P>
<P>
   It was Woods' fifth victory this year, his fourth in America,
the 11th PGA Tour victory of his career. He is No. 1 on the tour's
leader money list this year, and he can probably start writing his
Player of the Year award speech.
</P>
<P>
   At age 23, Jack Nicklaus had won three majors on his way to
winning 18. Woods has two, and this one, he will never forget,
because a player four years younger gave him everything he wanted.
Yet, when it was over, Woods was where he wants to be _ sitting on
to of the golf world.

GOP HOPEFULS RETHINK CHANCES AFTER STRAW POLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMES, Iowa _ The Republican presidential race seemed on the
brink of shrinking Sunday, as Lamar Alexander signaled that he was
likely to drop out after a dismal finish in Saturday's Iowa straw
poll and other candidates reconsidered their strategies as the
focus shifts to New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   While Texas Governor George W. Bush and Steve Forbes had been
expected to make their one-two finish in the straw poll in the
first-caucus state, the winner of the expectations game was
Elizabeth Dole, who had been pilloried by the pundits and was
clearly rejuvenated by her solid third-place showing.
</P>
<P>
   The vote ``was a wonderful victory for me,'' Dole said on
NBC-TV's ``Meet The Press'' as she prepared to travel to the
first-primary state of New Hampshire. ``I hope the pundits will
take my candidacy seriously now.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole's showing was also impressive because she spent far less
money than Bush and Forbes and she took the controversial step
earlier in the year of insisting that abortion should not be an
issue in the campaign, an unpopular decision in Iowa but one that
could be better received in other states.
</P>
<P>
   As the GOP candidates streamed out of Iowa Sunday, the campaign
focus is likely to shift now away from the social and agricultural
issues that were in the spotlight there and toward some of the
economic and tax policies that are likely to receive more scrutiny
in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, meanwhile, seemed on the verge of quitting after
receiving just 6 percent of the straw vote despite the hundreds of
days he has spent campaigning in Iowa during the last five years
and over the course of two presidential races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm disappointed,'' Alexander said on ``Meet the
Press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a powerful force in this country to nominate George W.
Bush. Over the next day or two I'll be thinking about that.''
</P>
<P>
   A top Alexander aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
he expected an announcement by the former Tennessee governor Monday
in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Aides had indicated that Alexander would quit if he finished
poorly, especially since it would hurt fund-raising for his
cash-starved campaign. The prospect that Alexander would quit after
a nonbinding straw poll underscored how significant the straw vote
has become, despite complaints from some analysts that the event is
a meaningless exercise in vote-buying. The Forbes campaign spent
more than $1.5 million on the event, followed by Bush's tab of more
than $750,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, by contrast, spent about $200,000 to pull in her 3,410
votes, suggesting she could have done even better if she had the
resources of Bush or Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   With Dole aides touting their ``invisible army'' of supporters,
they hoped to put to rest recent reports that have characterized
her campaign as running on fumes.
</P>
<P>
   The straw poll was a possible disaster for Dan Quayle, the
former vice president. He has insisted he will stay in the race,
but his prospects seemed dim given his lackluster tally of 916
votes, which put him in eighth place, behind radio host Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, however, Quayle was unbowed, telling Fox News that he
would ``absolutely not'' quit the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I am the only one who can put the Reagan coalition
together, the social conservatives, economic conservatives,
national defense conservatives,'' Quayle said.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the candidates who are basing their campaigns on
those issues disagreed. Gary Bauer, a former Reagan domestic
adviser and head of the Family Research Council, said his
fourth-place finish in the poll showed that he was a leading voice
for social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamics of the race could now hinge greatly on Forbes, who
is using his own money to finance a national television ad campaign
that proved effective in Iowa. That is potentially bad news for
Bush, whose hope was to wrap up the nomination early without a
bruising primary battle.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, Forbes conducted intensive research into the
way he is perceived by Iowa voters. The result was disheartening:
Iowans knew him as a rich publisher and had no idea he had a family
life, with five daughters. As a result, Forbes has carefully
marketed his family, with ads that show his daughters saying how
much he cares about them. When Forbes supporters were interviewed
at the straw poll on Saturday, they invariably mentioned Forbes's
daughters and their belief that he is a family man.
</P>
<P>
   This is a far cry from 1996, when Forbes ran a one-note campaign
for the 17 percent flat tax, which would have provided a far
greater benefit to the wealthiest Americans. This time, Forbes
sometimes skims over the flat tax. And, instead of trying to parse
words on abortion, as he did in 1996, he flatly declares himself to
be ``pro-life,'' which helped him immeasurably among many Iowa
Republicans. Forbes also hired a number of former Christian
Coalition officials in an effort to strengthen ties with religious
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa contest also highlighted the way Forbes and Bush are
competing for the role of outsider. Forbes, who has never held
elective office, is running as a businessman fighting against
Washington. Bush runs as a governor who will take on Washington,
but he has the backing of most of the Washington GOP establishment,
making it harder for him to argue that he will change the culture
of the capital. On Sunday, Forbes said Bush was all money and no
message, which the publisher said ``equals mush.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Quayle, who served as a US representative, US senator and
vice president, is trying to run as an outsider. And though Quayle
owes his national prominence to former President Bush, who was
Quayle's running mate in 1988 and 1992, Quayle doesn't hesitate to
attack George W. Bush as an out-of-touch tool of the Washington
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Washington establishment wants to tell you who to vote
for,'' Quayle said in a speech Saturday before the straw vote
results were announced. ``They say that issues don't matter. Let's
send them a message.''
</P>
<P>
   But the message that was sent to Quayle in Iowa appeared to be
that his time in the national spotlight may have passed.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain of Arizona, who didn't participate in what
he called the ``sham'' straw vote, said he looked forward to
campaigning in New Hampshire and another early primary state, South
Carolina.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE PUTT THAT KEPT THE KID AT BAY 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON  
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ The dreaded six-foot putt. Short enough to make,
long enough to miss. And now, on the 17th green, Tiger Woods knew
he had to make it. If he didn't, after having had a five-stroke
lead on the 12th tee, he suddenly would be tied with the
19-year-old Spanish prodigy, Sergio Garcia, going to the final hole
in his struggle to win a second major title, alias the 81st
Professional Golfers' Association Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hit a pretty good chip, but it landed in a dead spot,'' he
would say later of his wedge out of the tangled rough behind the
green on the 206-yard 17th hole. ``I needed to carry it over that
dead spot and it came up short. I kept seeing the putt as on top of
the hole, but I knew this putt didn't break as much as it looked.''
</P>
<P>
   As he surveyed the line, his caddie, Steve Williams, told him,
``Inside left.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Perfect,''' Woods said later. ``I made sure I
stayed steady, made sure the blade released through the ball
because a lot of times on a left-to-right putt, it's easy to block
the ball and I released the blade. I don't remember seeing it start
off because I was keeping my head steady, but I remember seeing it
zeroing in and it fell right in.''
</P>
<P>
   In saving a par 3 there, Tiger Woods had holed the most critical
putt of his career.
</P>
<P>
   When he won the 1997 Masters by 12 strokes, he never had a putt
anywhere near that critical because he never had another golfer
creep into his competitive consciousness that afternoon at Augusta
National as Sergio Garcia did on the back nine Sunday at Medinah
while bursting into the golf world's consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I still had a one-shot lead,'' Woods said later,
``I expected Sergio to birdie 18, you should always expect your
opponent to do that, so I thought I'd need to make a birdie at 18,
too. That's why I hit a 3-wood off the tee, but when I saw he made
a par, I knew I could win with a par.
</P>
<P>
   He did, hitting a wedge into the middle of the green on the
389-yard final hole and two-putting from 20 feet. But making that
dreaded 6-foot putt was the stroke that won the PGA, the stroke
that kept Garcia at bay until at least next year's Masters, if not
next month's Ryder Cup matches.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager from Spain is here to stay. When any golfer, or
any athlete for that matter, is that good that young, it's not an
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Seve Ballesteros was a teen-age genius at golf more than
two decades ago, so is Seve's skinny, smiling protege with the
poise of a longtime pro. The Medinah galleries had adopted him when
he shot a 66 for the first-round lead, and when he drained an
18-foot birdie putt on the 219-yard 13th hole, he turned and looked
back at Woods, only three strokes ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted Tiger to know,'' Garcia would say, ``that I was still
there and to show him that he had to finish well to win. But it
wasn't a bad thing. I did it with good feelings, so I was kind of
telling him, `If you want to win, you have to play well.'''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Woods chopped his way to a double-bogey 5 there.
His lead was now one stroke. He would go two ahead when Garcia
missed an 8-foot par putt at the 15th, but then he would bogey the
452-yard 16th after Garcia had hit the shot of the tournament,
slicing a 6-iron from 189 yards next to a tree onto the green to
produce the roar of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem,'' Garcia explained, ``was on the downswing, I
could hit the first part of the tree. So I was making sure not to
do that, but not to hit it a little to the right because then it
will hit the second part of the tree. On the downswing, I just
closed my eyes, hit the ball and went backwards just in case the
ball hits the tree and hits me.''
</P>
<P>
   When Garcia opened his eyes and saw his ball going to the green,
he sprinted and leaped across the fairway to watch it. And from
there to the 18th green, the galleries cherished him. So did Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sergio needs to be commended,'' Woods would say, ``not only
for the way he played but the way he conducted himself. He was
emotional, yes, but he was fiery. He was trying. He never dogged it
and it was wonderful to see.''
</P>
<P>
   And for the next two decades, the duels between Woods and Garcia
should be wonderful to see.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, the best golfers have always needed rivals to
make them better. Bobby Jones had Walter Hagen and Gene Sarazen.
Ben Hogan had Byron Nelson and Sam Snead. Jack Nicklaus had Arnold
Palmer and Gary Player. Tom Watson had Lee Trevino and Ballesteros.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, David Duval has loomed as Woods' rival and he is. But
Duval, at 27, has yet to duel with Woods in a major while Garcia,
at only 19, already has, but Woods considered Duval one of many
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there's David Duval,'' Woods said, ``but there are
so many good young players in the 20s _ Justin Leonard, Ernie Els,
Phil Mickelson _ and Sergio being in his teens, he's going to be a
wonderful player for a number of years. But you've also got Lee
Westwood and Darren Clarke from overseas. Any given week, pick any
two of those and that could be the rivalry.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sergio Garcia is the new name. And if Tiger Woods had not
made that dreaded 6-footer on the 17th green, the kid from Spain
might be the P.G.A. champion. &QL;

DOLE RE-EMERGES AS STRONG PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDER AFTER STRAW POLL

   DES MOINES, Iowa _ The pundits' old conventional wisdom on
Elizabeth Dole's campaign: a disappointment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new: definitely back in the game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a third-place finish in Saturday's Iowa straw poll, Dole
re-established herself as a top-tier Republican presidential
contender who is prepared to go the distance against front-runner
George W. Bush, the Texas governor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Dole's allowed to say that she's still in this race,'' said
Rich Galen, a former Newt Gingrich ally who is not affiliated with
any candidate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dole garnered 14 percent of the vote, less than half of Bush's
31 percent. The former Labor Secretary and president of the
American Red Cross pointed out, however, that she spent only a
fraction of the money that Bush and second-place finisher Steve
Forbes poured into the race. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And Dole didn't populate her straw poll tent with big-name
entertainers and sports stars as other campaigns did to attract
votes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To Dole, her low-budget performance was a smashing triumph, and
she proclaimed it as such Sunday at a noon rally at her Iowa
campaign headquarters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Did we have a great victory last night?'' she asked a roaring
crowd. ``Fabulous.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dole's re-emergence after weeks of doubt about her fledgling
effort was just one significant development in the straw poll's
wake. Disappointed by his sixth-place finish, former Tennessee Gov.
Lamar Alexander appeared ready to pack it in. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to sit down ... and reconsider my candidacy,''
Alexander said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another candidate suffering the poor-finish blues was former
Vice President Dan Quayle, who came in eighth, with 4 percent. But
he said he wasn't quitting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I'm the only one who can put together the Reagan
coalition,'' he said on CBS' ``Face the Nation.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of Quayle's rivals, religious conservative Gary Bauer, who
finished fourth with 9 percent, can now argue he should be the
right wing's rallying point, analysts said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-place finisher Pat Buchanan was disappointed. He continued
to flirt with the idea of abandoning the GOP to run on the Reform
Party ticket. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Magazine publisher Steve Forbes, meantime, made the case that he
should be the choice of the party's right wing as a result of his
second-place, 21 percent showing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm emerging as the conservative alternative,'' said
Forbes, who spent an estimated $1 million or more on the straw
poll. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush appeared to solidify his front-runner standing. On Sunday,
aides pointed out that Bush entered the race only weeks ago and
despite flush coffers, did not spend any money advertising on radio
or television before Saturday's vote. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We did this the Iowa way,'' meaning that Bush developed a
strong grass-roots network, spokeswoman Karen Hughes said on ``Meet
the Press.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Dole may get the biggest boost of any candidate from the
nonscientific, nonbinding straw poll. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to the event, some reports portrayed Dole
as something of a letdown, disorganized and unprepared to
capitalize on the crush of early attention her candidacy received. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, no assistants were on hand to collect names or
donations in February when Dole attracted more than 2,000 Iowans to
an Ames speech, an eye-popping total for an early campaign event. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And her fund-raising total of just $3.5 million paled in
comparison to Bush's $36.3 million through the end of June. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, however, those disappointments had faded. Asked at
headquarters how she would capitalize on her showing, Dole didn't
hesitate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Just continuing to work hard,'' she told reporters. ``To me,
that's it. You put in the hard work, you build a great team.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As if to demonstrate her commitment, Dole spent painstaking
minutes autographing a pair of T-shirts stretched taut across the
back of a young supporter. She signed posters and at one point, she
took on the task of signing a baseball, which she described as no
easy task. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But she plowed ahead, slowly inscribing each letter of her name
while appearing undaunted by how long she was taking and how many
people still waited to greet her. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a slow writer,'' Dole said, adding to her reputation as a
perfectionist. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dole also fed criticism, as Bush has, that she refuses to take
stands on contentious issues. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the Sunday morning news shows, Dole declined to answer
questions on whether she believed in evolution or the creationist
view of how the world developed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a person of strong faith,'' Dole responded, refusing to
elaborate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She also would not say what steps she would take to stop the
flow of illegal drugs from Mexico. ``I'm going to leave open my
options at this point.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   None of that appeared to matter to her jubilant supporters
Sunday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think everyone sees her as someone to be reckoned
with now,'' said Aimee Sullivan, 24, of Springfield, Ill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Her campaign is re-energized,'' declared Cindy Wycoff of Sioux
City, Iowa, whose daughter works for Dole. But Wycoff acknowledged
that she wasn't sure Dole could get past Bush. ``It'll be hard,''
she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The straw poll demonstrated that Dole could transform curious
onlookers excited about the prospect of the nation's first woman
president into loyal supporters, said Steve Roberts, Dole's
honorary campaign chairman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, 1987 and 1995, the eventual GOP nominee was among the
top three straw poll finishers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the pundits take my candidacy seriously now,'' Dole
said. &QL;

 &HT;    Woods takes PGA
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ Advantage, Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop, The Country Club, Brookline, Mass., for the Ryder Cup
matches in September.
</P>
<P>
   This was only Round One Sunday under an azure sky at Medinah
Country Club. There will be at least a hundred or so more such
confrontations over the next 20 years. By the time Tiger Woods and
Sergio Garcia stop flailing against each other in major golf
championships around the globe, enough hardware and cold cash will
have been distributed to construct a row of Las Vegas casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, the old man of 23, bested the 19-year-old Spaniard Sunday
in the 81st PGA Championship in a final-round drama that evolved
sufficiently to place television executives into near-ecstasy.
David Duval-Woods? Forget it. Short of Arnold and Jack dipping
their tootsies into a Fountain of Youth and re-appearing on the
scene in a flood of polyester, it could get no better than this.
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't really over until Woods gutted in a 8-foot par
putt at the 17th after hitting into the gunch and Garcia's 15-foot
birdie putt at the 18th stayed out of the hole. Winning his second
major championship 28 months after shocking the world at the 1997
Masters, Woods won by a stroke, at 11-under-par 277 on a closing
even-par 72. Garcia, with a 71, finished at 10-under 278.
</P>
<P>
   Three strokes back came Stewart Cink, who started the day two
shots back but could not find any putting success during a 73 and
finished at 8-under 280. Falling four shots short was two-time
champion Nick Price, who crashed with a double-bogey at the 16th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot more pressure here,'' Woods said, comparing the
Masters and his second professional major. ``If I had lost that
nine-shot lead, I probably would have killed myself. . . It's hard
to compare the two (majors) because they're two completely
different situations. One was for the (Masters) record and had more
of a social impact than this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the back nine Sunday, Woods, who started the day
tied Canada's Mike Weir at 11-under, put the excitement back in the
afternoon. Ahead of Garcia by five shots through 11 holes, Woods
suddenly was up by only one. After Garcia birdied the 13th,
igniting a crowd that jumped on him as the favorite, he pumped his
fist and gave a glance back to Woods on the teebox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to know I was still there and to show him that he
had to finish well to win,'' Garcia said. ``It wasn't a bad thing.
I did it with good feelings, not hoping he would make a
triple-bogey of something. I was kind of telling him, `If you want
to win, you have to play well.'''
</P>
<P>
   Woods didn't triple-bogey, but almost. While the Medinah crowd,
loosening up through the Budweiser effect, threw insults toward him
and playing partner Mike Weir, Woods flew over the 13th green with
a 6-iron chipped back long and eventually missed a bogey putt from
eight feet. The lead had been whittled to one stroke.
</P>
<P>
   After Garcia bogeyed the 15th, he parred the 16th with an
off-balance, face-wide-open shot from the base of a large tree that
found the green with a shot right out of Seve Ballesteros'
scrapbook. Woods then bogeyed the 16th, overestimating the wind on
a 186-yard, uphill 8-iron and finding the bunker, and the lead was
back to one again.
</P>
<P>
   At the 17th, Woods basically put an overlapping grip on the
Wanamaker Trophy. After missing the green of the 206-yard par-3 and
finding the high grass, Woods chipped delicately to eight feet,
then firmly struck a left-edge putt and sank it for par. A slow
pump of his fist sensed a job almost done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just inside the left edge,'' Woods said. ``I said,
`Just go ahead and just trust your stroke and bury it.' I said,
`Keep nice and steady and let the blade release,' and it released
perfectly. I looked up and the ball was going in.''
</P>
<P>
   Two putts at the 18th and Woods had his second major -- a fifth
of you count the three U.S. Amateurs. But golf had the making of
the rivalry it so much wishes to follow. In the matador-like
Garcia, who Sunday was running up the fairway to see his ball land
and leaping in the air, Woods has fiery competition that hasn't
been there during TV's attempt to channel Woods against Duval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today Sergio played a wonderful round of golf,'' Woods said.
``He did what he needed to do, and he needs to be commended for not
only the way he played, but the way he conducted himself. He was
emotional, yes, but he was fiery. He was trying. He never dogged
it, and it was wonderful to see.''''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I turned pro, I wanted to be the No. 1 golfer in the
world,'' said Garcia, ``so I knew I would be a rival for Tiger. ..
. I'm a little unhappy I didn't win, but inside of me I feel like I
won. Being 19 years old, you can't ask for anything more.''

ATTORNEY GENERAL TO CHALLENGE $5 BILLION MERGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly on Monday will
formally appeal the approval of two electric and gas utility
mergers totaling nearly $5 billion and affecting 2 million Eastern
Massachusetts customers, contending Governor Paul Cellucci's
administration betrayed consumers' interests in backing the deals.
</P>
<P>
   Under a procedure last used in 1984, officials said Sunday,
Reilly will challenge the state Department of Telecommunications
and Energy's approval of new rate plans supporting the Boston
Edison-Commonwealth Energy merger and the acquisition of Colonial
Gas by the parent company of Boston Gas.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, utility regulators appointed by Cellucci have
been criticized by consumer and business groups for allowing the
utilities to charge customers for hundreds of millions of dollars'
worth of ``acquisition premiums'' being paid to shareholders and
investment bankers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 40 years, for example, the 1.3 million customers
of Edison and ComEnergy will be charged for about $500 million _
and by Reilly's estimates closer to $1 billion _ worth of
merger-related costs. That includes the value of cash and stock
being distributed to the companies' shareholders in excess of what
the companies were worth before they agreed to merge.
</P>
<P>
   In connection with their mergers, Edison and ComEnergy have
agreed to freeze rates for four years. Colonial would cut the
cost-of-gas part of the bill by 2.2 percent immediately, and freeze
the other part of the bill _ the cost of distributing gas _ for 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with all four utilities say that consumers, over time,
will save far more on monthly bills than the acquisition premiums
will cost them, and will also get better service.
</P>
<P>
   But officials Sunday said Reilly thinks current rates are too
high and should be cut, not merely frozen, and consumers should get
stronger guarantees of receiving savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't fault Edison or Boston Gas for doing what they can
for their shareholders, but the DTE is charged with protecting the
ratepayers,'' a person close to Reilly, who asked for anonymity,
said Sunday. ``We don't think they did that in these cases. We
think we are the last hope for protecting ratepayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly will appeal the rate rulings to the DTE and also, Monday
or later this week, to the Supreme Judicial Court, which handles
conflicts between state agencies. The last attorney general to use
this appeal process was Francis X. Bellotti in a 1984 Fitchburg Gas
&AMP; Electric case, Reilly aides said.
</P>
<P>
   DTE chairwoman Janet Gail Besser has defended the agency's
handling of acquisition premiums, saying she is confident that both
combinations will produce, in the long run, lower costs and better
service for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies won't receive the acquisition premium unless
savings from the merger equal or exceed it,'' Besser said, adding
that in the future ``it's a good possibility there will be some
justification for lowering rates.''
</P>
<P>
   L. Carl Gustin, senior vice president of Edison parent BEC
Energy, said state regulators ``recognized, and there was
sufficient evidence to recognize, that the savings will
significantly outweigh the costs over time.''
</P>
<P>
   Edison and ComEnergy officials expect the $4.4 billion merger of
their holding companies into a new company called NStar will close
within a month. Gustin said the 1.3 million Eastern Massachusetts
customers served by the utilities will pay $3.5 billion less on
their bills over the next 40 years than they would if the companies
did not merge.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Edison-ComEnergy combination and the $495 million
acquisition of Colonial Gas by Boston Gas parent Eastern
Enterprises involve holding-company combinations, which are not
subject to state approval. However, the deals do involve, and
regulators last month approved, new rate schedules for Colonial,
ComEnergy, and Edison.
</P>
<P>
   While Reilly challenges the new rate plans, consumers would
continue to pay current rates, and it appears unlikely that
Reilly's action would derail or delay the mergers.
</P>
<P>
   The fight will not affect the planned 5 percent electric rate
reduction mandated to take effect Sept. 1 under last year's
industry restructuring law.
</P>
<P>
   Taking on the utility mergers could help Reilly, a former
Middlesex district attorney who has emphasized his crime-fighter
role, address charges made by his 1998 primary-election foe, former
state senator Lois G. Pines, that Reilly would fall short on the
consumer-protection aspect of his office.
</P>
<P>
   Groups as diverse as Associated Industries of Massachusetts, the
state's biggest business lobby, and the Massachusetts Public
Interest Research Group, a Ralph Nader-established consumer group,
have opposed the Edison-ComEnergy merger and have considered their
own suits to block it.
</P>
<P>
   MassPIRG energy program director Rob Sargent praised Reilly,
saying: ``Somebody needs to send a message to the electric
utilities that they have been getting exactly what they wanted for
too long, and somebody needs to step in and let them know the time
has come for the consumer to take priority. People are getting fed
up with the greed.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the nation, regulators have long struggled with how to
handle utility mergers. Many believe that unless shareholders can
get some benefit, mergers _ even those that ultimately save
consumers money and improve service _ will never be pursued.
</P>
<P>
   Some states, including Kentucky and Maryland, have required that
utility shareholders split savings 50-50 with consumers. Other
states _ including until recently Massachusetts _ have forbidden
merging utilities to charge costs to customers, a stance that
largely thwarted utility combinations.
</P>
<P>
   Gustin said Edison and ComEnergy customers will get far more
than half the savings from meshing the companies, because under the
rate order ``all the net savings are intended to flow to customers
and not be shared with shareholders after the costs are
recovered.''
</P>
<P>
   Besser said Massachusetts law ``doesn't really have a good
mechanism'' for mandating as a precondition that merger savings be
passed on to consumers. But she said, ``We do think customers can
be protected under the procedures we have.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Trying to reassure an anxious nation that it was not
being drawn into a Chechnya-like quagmire, Russian commanders
insisted Sunday that Islamic militants dug into remote mountain
strongholds in the southern republic of Dagestan were already on
the verge of defeat.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of fighting, commanders said Russian warplanes,
helicopters and artillery had begun to decimate the rebels. Now,
they insisted, Russian troops were ferreting out the die-hards to
destroy Shamil Basayev, the Chechen commander of the insurgents,
and his band of rebels once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about a total liquidation of the militants,''
Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, the chief of the Russian general staff,
boldly declared.
</P>
<P>
   But some of Russia's most knowledegable military specialists are
skeptical that a victory can be delivered within the two weeks the
commanders have promised _ if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Dagestan, they say, may not be another Chechnya _ a bloody
two-year war that killed tens of thousands, humiliated the
once-proud Russian military and led to the de facto independence of
that republic.
</P>
<P>
   But it does present similar traps, they warn, like being lured
into a heavy-handed and widening military campaign that risks
alienating the local population. Even in this early stage, the
conflict has become an unwelcome challenge to a Russian military
left demoralized by the Chechen war and which sought to restore
some of its lost luster this summer by racing to Kosovo ahead of
NATO peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian military has learned nothing from Chechnya and is
totally unprepared for this war,'' said Pavel Felgenhauer, a
military analyst with the newspaper Segodnya. ``It can't be done
with airpower alone and the troops are not good enough to take the
ground. Shamil Basayev still has the initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Chechnya, there are several important political factors
in the Russians' favor this time. The local authorities in
Dagestan, as well as a multitude of ethnic groups, are so far
backing the campaign against the militants, who say they want to
set up a new Islamic state. Nor do the rebels have the support of
the Chechen government in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of sheer firepower, the rebels are heavily outgunned
and have not been able to infiltrate Dagestan's major towns and
cities, a telling development for those who recall how the Chechen
rebels turned Grozny into an urban killing zone for Russian armored
columns.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians of all stripes in Moscow also seem to back the
military campaign, including sharp critics of the Chechen war like
Grigory Yavlinsky, the leader of the Yabloko party.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is radically different from what occurred in Chechnya,''
Yavlinsky said Sunday. ``That was a war by separatists who had 95
percent of the population behind them. This is aggression by
Islamic extremists against Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   But the insurgents do have some things going for them. They know
the mountain terrain and are familiar with Russian air and ground
tactics from the Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
   They are also counting on confusion among the hodge-podge of
paratroop, Interior Ministry and police units that constitutes the
Russian force in Dagestan _ a problem that bedeviled the Russian
military during the Chechen conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Russian commanders insist they have streamlined their command
structure in Dagestan and have vowed to produce a victory within
the next two weeks. If so, they have accomplished a miraculous
transformation.
</P>
<P>
   Just before he was ousted as prime minister on Aug. 9, Sergei
Stepashin complained that no one was really in charge of the
situation in Dagestan because Russian commanders were reluctant to
put their reputations on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who remember 1994 and 1995 are afraid to take
responsibility,'' Stepashin said, referring to the disastrous
Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
   Lodged between the oil-rich Caspian Sea and the mountains of the
North Caucuses, Dagestan has only about 2 million people, drawn
from more than 30 ethnic groups. While Russia's economic crisis has
weakened Moscow's authority there, the Dagestan authorities want to
remain part of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting began when Basayev and Khattab, a Jordanian-born
militant who joined up with the Chechen leader during the Chechen
war, led hundreds of Islamic militants across the border and
proclaimed that they would establish a new Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows for sure how many fighters are involved, but the
Russian Interior Ministry has estimated that there are 1,200
militants, one-third of whom have remained in reserve in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military has declined to say how many troops it has
in Dagestan, but experts estimate they number several thousand,
several hundred of which are directly involved in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   While Russian commanders insist they have enough combat-hardened
troops, several thousand of Russia's best paratroopers are not
available for the fight. They are on peacekeeping missions in
Bosnia-Herzogovina and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Russian officials say that 14 Russian soldiers and more
than 200 guerrillas have been killed in the fighting in Dagestan.
The rebels deny they have suffered such heavy losses and say they
have killed far more Russian troops, including three Russian
prisoners who were allegedly shot when they tried to escape.
</P>
<P>
   This is a conflict, however, that involves politics as much as
body counts. If the Russians level Dagestan villages and
settlements in their hunt for the rebels, they risk turning the
local population against them.
</P>
<P>
   Large-scale bombing raids or even a ground assault against rebel
bases in Chechnya might deprive the militants of their havens near
Dagestan. But they could also incite more Chechens to join the
militants. In fact, some analysts think Basayev's strategy is to
lure the Russians to do precisely that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you escalate you are giving the enemy an advantage,'' said
Dimitri Trenin, a former lieutenant colonel in the Russian military
and the deputy director of the Moscow office of the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of mounting an all-out offensive, Trenin said, the
Russian military should try to contain the rebels in Dagestan by
conducting a diplomatic effort to cut off their foreign sources of
financial support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Military force alone will not yield the results Russia is
looking for,'' he said. ``There is no quick-fix policy.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is not how the Russian military is talking. On Sunday,
Col. Gen. Anatoly Kornukov, the commander of the Russian air force,
told the Russian news agency Interfax that the Islamic militants
would soon be defeated by a punishing offensive involving the
``full-scale'' use of airpower.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the bravado on both sides, the conflict still
appears to be in the early stages. Responding to the incursion by
the militants, the Russian military has poured troops into Botlikh,
a town near the Chechen border which is surrounded by
rebel-infested hills. And for several days Russian troops have been
fighting to take the high ground.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Russian Interior Ministry in Dagestan
asserted that the Russians had killed another 21 rebels on Sunday
and that only four of the 32 villages in the Botlikh region were
now controlled by the militants.
</P>
<P>
   Dagestani authorities, for their part, announced Sunday that
Dagestani villagers had foiled a column of 60 militants led by
Basayev's brother by carrying out a daring ambush that involved
rolling boulders onto the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels said they would respond to the Russian attacks with a
new offensive. And even the Russians conceded that the militants
were continuing to send reinforcements from Chechen territory.
</P>
<P>
   As the fighting intensified, Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov
warned the Russians not to carry out attacks against targets in
Chechnya and decreed a monthlong state of emergency, which calls
for a 10 p.m. curfew and the mobilization of veterans of the
Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
   Russian planes struck a rebel base on Friday near the Chechen
town of Kenkhi, located near the border with Dagestan. But the
Russians have not announced any bombing attacks against Chechen
targets since then.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have also insisted that they are not planning a
land invasion of Chechnya despite Gen. Kvashnin's vow to wipe out
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the swirl of allegations and countercharges, it has not
always been clear how Russian forces have been used. Last week, two
Soviet-made warplanes zoomed over Georgia, which borders Chechnya,
and dropped Soviet-made cluster bombs on a Georgian village.
</P>
<P>
   After initially denying that any air attack took place, Russian
authorities conceded that there had been a bombing raid but stopped
short of acknowledging that Russian aircraft were involved. And
Russia's air force chief made no mention of the incident on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am absolutely satisfied with the Air Force's operation
against the militants,'' he said.

Startup Mixes Net Shops, Communities
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Dan Fost
</P>
<P>
   A new service from a small San Francisco software company aims
to add virtual stores to the virtual communities that are sprouting
online.
</P>
<P>
   Snapshop.com, a Web service from the eight-person Haight Street
firm Media in Motion, is being tested on Delphi Forums, where 2
million members talk about everything from Honda motorcycles to
polymer clay in 80,000 active forums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody talks about marrying commerce with community. The
problem is, everything today is pretty intrusive,'' said Jim
Leightheiser director of product management for Delphi Forums in
Cambridge, Mass. Delphi is testing Snapshop and plans to make it
available to all of its forum hosts at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   By intrusive, Leightheiser means irritating ads for minivans or
microwaves that pop up in forums where the topics are macrame or
cable modems. Instead, Snapshop enables a forum's host to control
what is offered in the store.
</P>
<P>
   If someone in, say, a mountain biking forum talks about a great
new tire, the host could offer that tire for sale.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Media In Motion has struck deals with scores of
vendors supplying a range of products to Internet users, and it
plans to add more as quirky new forums come online.
</P>
<P>
   It offers 3 million products from a wide range of companies,
including Black and Decker, Broderbund, Cuisinart, Fisher Price,
Fruit of the Loom, Maytag, Merriam-Webster, Nine West, Rawlings,
Samsonite, Serta Mattress, Timberland, Toshiba and Wrangler. The
main challenge Snapshop needs to overcome is the pitfall of trying
to sell a product to people who are online to talk, not shop.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of SNAPSHOP (1057 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``Good conversation isn't necessarily the same thing as wanting
to go shopping for something,'' said Howard Rheingold of Mill
Valley, the author of ``Virtual Community.''
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Pillitteri, president of Media In Motion, said that if
people ``think the forum is being commercialized, they'll speak
up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's a trusted environment, it makes sense to enable
people to make purchases,'' Pillitteri said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Rich, who is host of a Delphi forum on Honda Shadow
motorcycles, said Snapshop is welcome as long as it's a service to
his group's 5,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you own a motorcycle, you can never stop spending enough
money in things to bolt onto it,'' said Rich, 55, an investment
manager in Dallas. He hopes Snapshop will enable members to band
together and receive group discounts from merchandisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in making any money from this,'' Rich said.
``I want vendors to offer substantial discounts. Snapshop has a way
that I can take whatever commission I'd earn and turn it into
discounts for the members. That's what I plan to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like an online forum can have the feel of a coffee shop
discussion, a recommendation to buy something from someone you've
met online can have the same weight as from a real-life neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this new world of networked retail, there's a lot of
referrals that are going to happen,'' said Bruce Katz, chief
executive of Well Engaged, a Sausalito firm that plans to use
Snapshop in a large online discussion site it now is developing. It
might also offer Snapshop to companies who use Well Engaged
software to create their own online communities, such as E-Trade,
CBS Sportsline and Forbes. Katz also is an investor in Snapshop,
and the largest investor in Delphi.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of SNAPSHOP (1057 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``We're looking at a whole new world of distributed retailing,''
Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   Blaine Mathieu, senior analyst specializing in e-commerce at the
San Jose research firm Dataquest, said Snapshop has a good idea in
bringing the wares of many merchants into one ``universal shopping
basket.'' That way, customers don't have to click once on a book
from one source, and again to buy a fishing pole from another
source.
</P>
<P>
   That should appeal to online communities who don't like sending
their customers off to other sites like Amazon.com or eToys.
</P>
<P>
   Inktomi, a San Mateo firm, provides a similar service to major
sites such as Yahoo, Mathieu said.

Union Bank Plans To Reduce Ranks By 1,400 People
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Sam Zuckerman
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
Union Bank of California, the second-largest bank headquartered in
the Golden State, will disclose a plan today to fire about 1,400
employees _ 15 percent of its work force.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the San Francisco bank said the cutback will affect
virtually all its business units, although some will feel the
effects more than others.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly two-thirds of the job cuts will be in Southern
California, where most Union employees work, while between 100 and
200 positions are likely to be lost in the Bay Area. The job cuts
are part of an 18-month program, dubbed ``Mission Excel,'' to
streamline bank operations and boost pretax profits by $225 million
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Institutional investors who bought Union's stock in a public
offering last year demanded a cost-cutting campaign designed to
bring the bank's staffing and efficiency levels to industry
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The bank, which is 64 percent owned by Japan's Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi, is carrying out the program despite record
revenue and profits. In the three months that ended in June, Union
earned $114.7 million, up 11 percent from the comparable period the
year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize we can do even better,'' said spokesman Stephen
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of California bank jobs have disappeared in the 1990s
as a result of cost-cutting drives and mergers involving longtime
institutions such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something other banks have already done,'' said Joseph
Morford, a San Francisco analyst with the brokerage firm Dain
Rauscher Wessels.
</P>
<P>
   Although Union never offered the lifetime job guarantees that
until recently were normal in Japan, the bank developed a
reputation as a benevolent employer that was slow to eliminate
unnecessary or redundant positions.
</P>
<P>
   The bank, which has $32 billion in assets and 241 branches in
California, took its current form four years ago when Japan's Bank
of Tokyo combined with Mitsubishi Bank and the two merged their
California units, the old Union Bank and Bank of California.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of UNIONBAN (76562 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The two banks avoided the slash-and-burn tactics American banks
usually follow when they merge. Relatively few positions were
eliminated, and those cuts largely took place through attrition.
What changed things was Union's 1998 sale of stock to U.S.
investors, a deal intended to raise cash for the Japanese parent
bank, then struggling amid that country's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure from investors gave the bank's American managers the
ammunition they needed to persuade Chief Executive Officer Takahiro
Moriguchi and wary officials of the parent company to give the
go-ahead for an ambitious cost-cutting and revenue-generating plan.
The bank then promised investors that it would cut its overhead to
about 55 cents for each dollar of revenue it takes in, down from
the current level of more than 60 cents for each dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all part of this greater focus on shareholder value which
they are hoping to translate into a higher stock price,'' Morford
said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $225 million in higher profits the program is trying to
produce, officials said about $135 million will come from shrinking
the workforce and other initiatives to pare costs. An additional
$90 million will come from higher revenue generated mainly by
raising fees charged to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Union will set aside $85 million in the current fiscal quarter
to cover the costs of the program, including $70 million for
severance.
</P>
<P>
   Employees who lose their jobs will receive as much as three
weeks' pay for every year of service with a minimum of four weeks
and a maximum of one year's salary, depending on their rank. The
bank will notify staff members who are losing their jobs by the end
of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and company insiders have warned that a deep
cost-cutting program could jeopardize Union's high level of
personal service, something that has been a competitive advantage
for the bank as Bank of America and Wells Fargo cut back branch
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customer service is something they are going to have to be
very careful about,'' said Morford.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of UNIONBAN (76562 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The bank insists that it is taking pains to preserve high service
levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``By changing the way we do business, we can do things more
efficiently without sacrificing our ability to provide customer
service,'' said Johnson, the bank spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said job cuts are taking place mainly in administrative
and back-office operations, especially those that perform
overlapping functions. For example, private banking service for
wealthy customers, currently a separate operation, will be combined
with a separate program for customers who keep large balances with
the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The bank will close some of its 20 processing and call centers,
but will not identify which ones until later, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Partially offsetting its cost cuts, Union plans to spend more on
Internet operations, telecommunications and branch-level computer
systems. No branches will be closed through the program, but they
will lose one or two staff members each. Johnson said service
levels will not suffer because the bank will move administrative
tasks out of the branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We answer 5.7 million calls a year in the branches,'' Johnson
said. ``We will push people to use our tele-services and computer
services instead.''
</P>
<P>
   To plan Mission Excel, Union hired a consulting firm experienced
with in-bank cost-cutting programs and assigned dozens of top
managers to work on the project full time.

problem is, everything today is pretty intrusive,'' said Jim
Leightheiser director of product management for Delphi Forums in
Cambridge, Mass. Delphi is testing Snapshop and plans to make it
available to all of its forum hosts at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   By intrusive, Leightheiser means irritating ads for minivans or
microwaves that pop up in forums where the topics are macrame or
cable modems. Instead, Snapshop enables a forum's host to control
what is offered in the store.
</P>
<P>
   If someone in, say, a mountain biking forum talks about a great
new tire, the host could offer that tire for sale.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Media In Motion has struck deals with scores of
vendors supplying a range of products to Internet users, and it
plans to add more as quirky new forums come online.
</P>
<P>
   It offers 3 million products from a wide range of companies,
including Black and Decker, Broderbund, Cuisinart, Fisher Price,
Fruit of the Loom, Maytag, Merriam-Webster, Nine West, Rawlings,
Samsonite, Serta Mattress, Timberland, Toshiba and Wrangler. The
main challenge Snapshop needs to overcome is the pitfall of trying
to sell a product to people who are online to talk, not shop.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of SNAPSHOP (1057 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``Good conversation isn't necessarily the same thing as wanting
to go shopping for something,'' said Howard Rheingold of Mill
Valley, the author of ``Virtual Community.''
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Pillitteri, president of Media In Motion, said that if
people ``think the forum is being commercialized, they'll speak
up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's a trusted environment, it makes sense to enable
people to make purchases,'' Pillitteri said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Rich, who is host of a Delphi forum on Honda Shadow
motorcycles, said Snapshop is welcome as long as it's a service to
his group's 5,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you own a motorcycle, you can never stop spending enough
money in things to bolt onto it,'' said Rich, 55, an investment
manager in Dallas. He hopes Snapshop will enable members to band
together and receive group discounts from merchandisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in making any money from this,'' Rich said.
``I want vendors to offer substantial discounts. Snapshop has a way
that I can take whatever commission I'd earn and turn it into
discounts for the members. That's what I plan to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like an online forum can have the feel of a coffee shop
discussion, a recommendation to buy something from someone you've
met online can have the same weight as from a real-life neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this new world of networked retail, there's a lot of
referrals that are going to happen,'' said Bruce Katz, chief
executive of Well Engaged, a Sausalito firm that plans to use
Snapshop in a large online discussion site it now is developing. It
might also offer Snapshop to companies who use Well Engaged
software to create their own online communities, such as E-Trade,
CBS Sportsline and Forbes. Katz also is an investor in Snapshop,
and the largest investor in Delphi.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of SNAPSHOP (1057 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``We're looking at a whole new world of distributed retailing,''
Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   Blaine Mathieu, senior analyst specializing in e-commerce at the
San Jose research firm Dataquest, said Snapshop has a good idea in
bringing the wares of many merchants into one ``universal shopping
basket.'' That way, customers don't have to click once on a book
from one source, and again to buy a fishing pole from another
source.
</P>
<P>
   That should appeal to online communities who don't like sending
their customers off to other sites like Amazon.com or eToys.
</P>
<P>
   Inktomi, a San Mateo firm, provides a similar service to major
sites such as Yahoo, Mathieu said.

Soon, You'll Surf the Web From Your Cell Phone
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Deborah Solomon
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
On September 20, consumers will get their first peek at the next
hot thing in cell phones _ Web access.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS plans to unveil the first mass-market Web phones next
month, allowing users to surf the Net, send and receive e-mail and
trade stocks _ all from the same size handset we now use to make a
cell phone call.
</P>
<P>
   While Sprint is the first to market, a slew of carriers plans to
introduce wireless Web phones over the next year as companies look
for ways to attract more cell phone users. Most of the phones will
allow customers to get e-mail, browse the Web and order products
online.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint has teamed up with Yahoo, which created a wireless Web
portal that allows users to tap into a portion of the World Wide
Web. The Yahoo portal also provides personalized content for cell
phones, so users can get updates on sports scores, news and stocks
sent directly to their handsets.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's wireless Web service works with a minibrowser that
accesses Web content formatted specifically for a cell phone
handset. Because the screens on cell phones are so small, the Web
browsing is limited mainly to text and to sites that have created
specialized ``minibrowser'' pages. The minibrowser technology was
developed by Redwood City's Phone.com.
</P>
<P>
   The forthcoming Palm VII personal organizer uses a similar
approach to Web access. Although few Web pages have adapted their
content for the small format, Sprint said more sites will be
available during the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Customers who spend at least $29.99 a month on Sprint PCS phone
service can add Web access for $9.99 a month. The company has
higher-usage plans with up to 1,200 voice and data minutes for
about $180 per month.
</P>
<P>
   To access the Web, customers with older cell phones will need to
get a new model. All Sprint PCS phones can get text-message updates
from Yahoo, but the Web access is available only on Sprint PCS
models launched in 1999 and beyond. The company is introducing four
new wireless Web phones, including a ``Smartphone'' by NeoPoint of
San Diego. The NeoPoint phone integrates a personal digital
assistant with a phone and Web access. That model _ Sprint PCS
NP1000 _ is expected to sell for about $400 and will be available
in September. The other phones start at $100.
</P>
<P>
   With its latest offering, Sprint also is trying to tap into a
cadre of mobile workers by giving them a way to wirelessly connect
their laptop to the Internet. The company plans to sell kits _
ranging from about $30 to about $200 _ that lets customers plug
their cell phone into a laptop and get wireless Web access.
</P>
<P>
   The phones access the Web at about 14.4 kilobits per second _
about the speed of an older dial-up modem. But Sprint officials
downplayed the speed, saying the convenience of having integrated
phone and Web access makes the product a quick solution for people
on the go.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get off the airplane, go to your gate, log on and
check your e-mail and your corporate intranet from your laptop,''
said Charles Levine, chief sales and marketing officer for Sprint
PCS. Or you can get your e-mail and check whether your next flight
is on time directly from your handset, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who track wireless technology said that while wireless
Web products are likely to mature over the next few years, the
Sprint offering is a significant first move.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important evolutionary step,'' said Andrew
Cole, head of the wireless practice at Renaissance Worldwide, a
consulting firm. ``Unlike some of the technology that has come
before, Sprint has a robust network that's very powerful. And the
company has realized that if you can make it simple and price it
well, you'll have a winning product.''
</P>
<P>
   However, mobile customers should not expect wireless Web phones
to take the place of traditional Internet surfing anytime soon,
Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very suitable for short messages, but clearly, it's
not good for cruising the Internet,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, ``it's a positive first beginning both for
Sprint and consumers.''

Buy Like Buffett Without Berkshire
<TEXT>
<P>
   By HARRY DOMASH
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A lot of us wish that we could invest like Warren Buffet _ and
for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett and his partners acquired control of Berkshire Hathaway,
then a textile company, in 1965. Since then, Buffet transformed
Berkshire into a conglomerate and, in effect, a closed-end mutual
fund, by acquiring a variety of businesses outright and purchasing
stock in other publicly traded companies.
</P>
<P>
   A $10,000 investment in Berkshire in 1965 would be worth about
$49 million today.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, anyone who hears about Buffett's investment success
wants to get in on the action. Berkshire Class A shares are going
for about $63,000, and the newer Class B stock is around $2,000.
Besides representing less ownership, the Class B shares have
limited voting rights.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fantastic track record, some investors don't see
Berkshire shares as a good deal today. They worry that Buffett's
reputation has created tremendous demand for Berkshire stock,
driving the share price to a hefty premium compared with the value
of the holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Others say Berkshire Hathaway itself has become heavily
dependent on the insurance business (about 70 percent of revenues)
and that the near-term outlook for the industry is clouded.
</P>
<P>
   For these investors, it makes more sense just to buy the same
publicly traded stocks Berkshire owns, thereby avoiding the
questions surrounding Berkshire itself.
</P>
<P>
   You could get a handle on Berkshire's holdings by reading its
annual reports and by carefully following the news.
</P>
<P>
   Or you could go online to Today's Value Investor
( &LR; www.tvinvestor.com &LR; ), run by Timothy Vick, a self-described
disciple of Warren Buffett.
</P>
<P>
   Click on Buffett Watch to see TVI's best estimate of Berkshire's
holdings. Berkshire doesn't issue a press release every time it
buys or sells a stock, so the information, gleaned mostly from
annual reports, can be months old.
</P>
<P>
   Because Buffett is a long-term investor, usually holding a stock
for many years, the lack of timeliness isn't a major concern. The
site's primary purpose is selling subscriptions to TVI's
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Berkshire's largest holdings include Coca-Cola, Gillette, Wells
Fargo Bank and Walt Disney. Some say these stocks have had their
day and likely will underperform the market in the future, and
because Buffett rarely sells, he is stuck with these companies.
Others fret that because Buffett avoids medical and technology
companies, he is missing the best future investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   These investors figure that it's better to do what Buffett would
do if he were just starting out today than to copy his existing
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett makes no secret of his stock-selection approach. His
``Chairman's Letter'' accompanies each Berkshire annual report.
Taken together, these letters describe his stock-picking
philosophy. You can download the letters going back to 1977 from
the Berkshire Hathaway site ( &LR; www.berkshirehathaway.com &LR; ).
Buffett's stock-picking style combines elements of both value and
growth investing.
</P>
<P>
   Green Mountain Asset Management Corp.'s Web site ( &LR; www. &LR; 
 &LR; stockresearch.com &LR; ) uses an investment philosophy ``quite similar
to that of Warren Buffett,'' according to information on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Bose, a registered investment adviser with more than
20 years of experience, does the analysis and makes
recommendations. Bose has a list of current recommendations, but
new stocks are added only occasionally. For instance, he added
Pfizer on August 7, but that was only the second addition since
Aug. 18, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Current Buy section includes a summary for each stock.
Clicking on the company name brings up additional analysis. Access
to the site is free.
</P>
<P>
   Another more active site is the Investment Mill
( &LR; www.investmentmill.com &LR; ) run by Gerald Oney, Jeffrey Fry and
Steve Lilley. They're all research analysts, with about 25 years of
combined experience. They are ``long-term, value oriented,'' but
like Buffett, they don't limit themselves to value stocks. They say
they will write ``positive notes about growth or even momentum
stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, they're adding new stocks on an irregular basis.
They've added one company so far in August and three last month,
but prior to that, they hadn't added anything since April.
</P>
<P>
   Their research reports don't have a rigid report format; each
one focuses on factors the analyst views as important for that
company. Sometimes it's the operating statements and balance sheet
items, other times it's an analysis of the company's technology.
The reports are top quality, among the best I've seen on the Web.
The reports are free, but they plan to start charging within the
next two or three months.
</P>
<P>
   You also can search out your own Warren Buffett stocks using the
free search tool available at Market Player
( &LR; www.marketplayer.com &LR; ). Market Player's stock screening tools are
more sophisticated than most found on the Web. Learning to use them
takes some time, but fortunately, Market Player provides sample
screens to get you started.
</P>
<P>
   One of these samples specifically is designed to search out
stocks meeting Buffett's criteria, looking for reasonably priced
companies with stable earnings growth, good profitability ratios
and a strong balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Select Sample Screens on Market Player's home page and then
click on Try It Out, next to Warren Buffett Stable Growth Screen to
run the search. I got a list of 58 companies when I ran it last
week. You can refine the search if you want to take the time to
learn the screening tools.
</P>
<P>
   As with any screening system, you'll get best results by
considering the stock list as investment candidates to be
researched further.

investing style, check out Warren Buffet Links ( &LR; buffett.8m.com &LR; ).

VENTURA BELTS THIRD SLAM AND ROGERS ENDS METS' COMPLETE-GAME FAMINE
AT 139 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When Robin Ventura comes to the plate with the
bases loaded, people are beginning to expect a grand slam. He
fulfilled those expectations Sunday, as he helped power the Mets to
a 12-5 pounding of the San Francisco Giants at 3Com Park with his
third grand slam of the season.
</P>
<P>
   He shared the spotlight with Kenny Rogers (2-0), who gave the
Mets their first complete game of the season after they had gone
139 games _ going back to Al Leiter's complete-game victory last
Sept. 4 _ without one. The major league record is 140, set set by
the Anaheim Angels this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other starters staged a little battle cry and gave him a
pep talk when he came in after the eighth,'' manager Bobby
Valentine said of Rogers. ``Then they came over to me and said he
was going out there. He was kind of cruising. I didn't see any
reason to use anybody else out there and he said he felt fine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an incentive to finish the game but it wasn't my
objective,'' Rogers said. ``When they scored all the runs in the
fifth and sixth, I knew I was going to stay in there until I had to
come out.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I was just saying, `Three more outs. Let's get the
complete game.' There has been so much talk about this. We take
pride in the fact we're a good rotation and that was kind of a
negative number. But you get one, and you don't have to deal with
the questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers gave up 12 hits, struck out eight and walked none. He
pitched three complete games for Oakland before being traded to the
Mets on July 23.
</P>
<P>
   The 13th grand slam of Ventura's major league career tied him
with his former teammate, Harold Baines, for the most grand slams
among active players and moved Ventura into a tie for tenth on the
career list. Lou Gehrig hit 23 grand slams during his Hall of Fame
career, the most by any player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea why I keep hitting them and I don't really care
to think about it,'' said Ventura, who hit grand slams earlier this
season in both games of a doubleheader sweep of the Milwaukee
Brewers, May 20, at Shea Stadium. ``I just think about hitting the
ball and if it goes out great. But I don't think you can think it's
a normal at-bat. You have to pretend it is, though. Because if you
go out thinking you're going to hit a home run in that situation,
you'll probably ground out to second.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura has not done that very often every base full. The
32-year-old third baseman is 7 for 13 (.538) with the three homers
and 21 runs batted in, in his first season with the Mets. For his
career, Ventura is 43 for 122 (.352) with the bases full with the
13 homers and a whopping 143 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's gotten to that point, where you expect
him to hit a grand slam every time,'' said Mike Piazza, who worked
Hernandez for a full-count walk to load the bases for Ventura.
``But he's definitely the guy we want to see up there in that
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   With two outs and the bases loaded in the fifth inning, and the
Mets trailing by 3-2, Ventura drilled a 1-0 fastball from Livan
Hernandez over the right-field fence for his latest grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets (72-47) also received home runs from Mike Piazza and
Edgardo Alfonzo in a 16-hit attack.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it is almost impossible to explain Ventura's uncanny
success.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine gave it a shot, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because he understands the pitcher is in trouble in that
situation,'' Valentine said. ``And from what we've seen, he seeks a
good pitch to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't everybody? Well, no, it turns out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first pitch wasn't and he took it,'' Valentine said.
``Some guys get a little anxious there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, he seems to relax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to make it a normal at-bat,'' Ventura said. ``I try
and block it out and do the same things I always do at the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, that has meant driving in runs in bunches. Ventura
leads the team with 97 RBIs and he is quickly closing in on his
career-best of 105. That was in 1996 with the Chicago White Sox,
when Ventura hit a career-best 34 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's homer was his team leading 27th. And it was more
special than most. Ventura's family and four children were among
the 70-odd guests he had at the park.

Genentech's Stock Coattails May Not Be Big Enough for Biotech to
Ride
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Tom Abate
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Genentech's performance since its return to Wall Street has been
nothing short of remarkable, but industry watchers aren't sure
whether its meteoric rise will be enough to lift the entire biotech
sector.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in the South San Francisco biotech giant began trading at
$97 last month, after Roche Holdings of Switzerland acquired full
control of Genentech, then quickly reissued a 17 percent stake in
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Genentech has rocketed to $167, gaining 72 percent
in a month. Its rise has boosted various biotech stock indexes,
which are heavily weighted to reflect the performance of the
largest firms.
</P>
<P>
   But San Francisco investment banker Steve Burrill said
Genentech's good fortune, and the strong showing of big biotech in
general, hasn't changed the bleak fact that most investors continue
to steer clear of early stage startups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has happened to cause John Q. Public to jump in and
buy early stage biotech,'' Burrill said. ``Investors who've been
around know these are the sorts of companies whose stocks won't
double in the next year, and it might actually halve in value.'' &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Mark Simon, a banker with BancBoston Robertson
Stephens, told BioCentury newsletter he sees signs that
institutional investors and day traders are tiring of tech stocks
and taking a fresh look at biotech.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a Genentech effect, it's hard to measure from the
performance of midsize biotech firms on the ``bellwether list'' of
BioSpace.com, a San Francisco Web site that tracks the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Gilead Sciences of Foster City, Protein Design Labs of Fremont
and Affymetrix of Santa Clara are three bellwethers that have
trended up in recent months. But their movements began before
Genentech's run and can be traced to news developments at all three
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Sangstat Medical Corp., another bellwether in Fremont, has
bounced up and down, driven by patent disputes clouding the future
of its newest drug.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's Chiron Corp. of Emeryville, the Bay Area's
other biotech giant. Its stock began a modest rise coincident with
Genentech's reappearance on Wall Street. But the uptick probably
had more to do with its own positive second-quarter results. Even
so, Chiron shares barely have climbed back to where they began the
year _ hardly evidence that Genentech has begun the tide to lift
all ships.
</P>
<P>
   Still, biotech optimists think that a broad biotech revival
could be near. In addition to Genentech's momentum, pharmaceutical
firms recently have embarked on a spate of acquisitions of small to
midsized biotech firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sort of M&AMP;A activity makes investors start wondering
whether they aren't missing something,'' said Mark Edwards, a
merger adviser with Recombinant Capital in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said the real test of the Genentech effect will come in
the fall and winter, when the biotech industry starts its big round
of conferences. These shows give investment bankers the chance to
introduce new companies to institutional investors who make or
break initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genentech's momentum, and the M&AMP;A activity, are the sort of
things that give the bankers something to talk about,'' Edwards
said.
</P>
<P>
   M&AMP;A COMPLAINTS: San Francisco investor Mark Lampert is irate
over one pending merger.
</P>
<P>
   Merck &AMP; Co., the pharmaceutical giant in New Jersey, recently
proposed to acquire Sibia Neurosciences of San Diego for $87
million. That worked out to $8.50 &UR;  &LR; a share, a 62 percent premium
over Sibia's $5.25 share price when the deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
   But Lampert, whose Biotechnology Value Fund owns about 15
percent of Sibia, thinks that premium doesn't compensate
shareholders for Sibia's most important assets. Sibia has developed
potential remedies for Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and
epilepsy. Lacking cash to put these drugs through costly human
trials, it licensed its inventions to drug companies _ but stands
to collect royalties if the drugs win approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those royalties are either worth nothing or a fortune,'' said
Lampert, who would like any sale to park future revenues in a trust
fund for early shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the Sibia story, a second, as yet unnamed firm has
a bid on the San Diego company. All this attention has helped raise
its price above Merck's $8.50 bid, making some adjustment seem
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   However this saga plays out, it contains a warning for early
investors in biotech startups. After all the fuss, Sibia still is
selling below the $11 it fetched when the firm went public in May
1996 _ the last time the window was wide open for biotech IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   LUCKY GENE? Industry watchers can hardly wait for the results of
several experiments aimed at using genetic therapy to cure
hemophilia. During the past decade, more than 200 experiments have
tried to turn on or off the genes that cause a variety of diseases.
None have succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   That's why all hopes are pinned on Chiron and Avigen, two East
Bay biotech firms which are testing different ``cures'' for this
inherited bleeding disease. A Chronicle article on April 12
outlined why new techniques may yet prove effective for hemophilia,
a relatively simple disease with a single genetic cause.

   In recent weeks, Chiron and Avigen have run neck and neck,
giving a handful of hemophiliacs shots of their different gene
therapies. Charles Engelberg, with Americal Securities in San
Francisco, recently said these experiments soon should reveal
whether either therapy helps blood to clot.
</P>
<P>
   But Stanford researcher Mark Kay, who works with Avigen, said
it's a bit too early for results. Avigen's third patient will only
receive his treatment later this month (hemophiliacs are all men),
and at a dosage so low that he'd be pleasantly surprised if
clotting resulted.
</P>
<P>
   Kay said it likely would be fall or winter, after a second round
of patients get higher doses of the therapy, before the experiments
yield answers. And then it's not a foregone conclusion that the
company immediately would publish data.
</P>
<P>
   So the decade-long wait for a successful gene therapy continues.
A recent article in the online magazine Signals
 &LR; (www.signalsmag.com)  &LR; provides a longer look at the significance
of these trials.

  Red Hat Using Its Head
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Henry Norr
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
How can a business succeed when potential customers can always get
its primary product for free?
</P>
<P>
   That question clearly didn't deter investors in Red Hat Inc.
last week. The Durham, N.C., company's main business is selling the
Linux operating system, which anyone can download at no charge from
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But when Red Hat made its initial public offering last week,
intense demand drove its share price up more than 500 percent in
three days _ from an opening price of $14 to a Friday close of
$85.25.
</P>
<P>
   That adds up to a market capitalization of almost $5.7 billion _
for an outfit that only has 140 employees and recorded sales of
just $10.8 million in the fiscal year that ended February 28.
</P>
<P>
   Is this just a reappearance of the same manic enthusiasm that
drove so many dubious Internet IPOs into the stratosphere earlier
this year? Will Red Hat also plummet back to earth in the coming
weeks? Perhaps. But Wall Street seems to believe that the company's
business plan makes more sense than a casual observer might
realize.
</P>
<P>
   The argument revolves around an ongoing transition in Red Hat's
business model _ from one that depends mainly on software sales to
one based primarily on its Web portal and on its growing service
and support programs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, nearly all of the company's &LR;   &LR; revenues came from
sales of Red Hat Linux, a retail package that includes the Linux
``kernel'' _ the core code that coordinates a computer's operations
_ and more than 400 pieces of related software on CD-ROM discs,
plus a printed manual.
</P>
<P>
   Users could find the same software and thousands of pages of
help files on the Web, or simply copy it _ legally, under the terms
of the ``open source'' license under which Linux is distributed _
from a friend.
</P>
<P>
   A fair number of users, however, evidently are willing to pay
for the convenience of getting all the necessary software on CD-ROM
discs and documentation in printed form. In fact, according to
International Data Corp., sales of Linux last year accounted for
more than 17 percent of new operating-system licenses on machines
used as servers, the muscular computers that power corporate
networks and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Red Hat is only one of about half a dozen companies selling such
packages (known in Linux lingo as ``distributions''), but the
five-year-old North Carolina company is the clear leader. According
to IDC analyst Dan Kusnetzky., it currently accounts for about 44
percent of paid Linux licenses worldwide, compared with a mere 11.5
percent for the runner-up, a German company named Suse.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  With interest in Linux burgeoning, the product alone might be
enough to make Red Hat profitable soon. Last year, it lost only
$130,000 _ practically nothing by the standards of the Internet
age.
</P>
<P>
   And IDC's Kusnetzky believes that there's ample room for the
company to increase sales, particularly by packaging the OS with
other open-source software targeted at particular market segments _
schools, Internet service providers, medical offices and so on.
Just last week, Red Hat announced a release tailored to e-commerce
operations.
</P>
<P>
   But no one really thinks that software sales alone justify Red
Hat's enormous valuation. The key to its future, as it explained in
the prospectus and ``road show'' meetings with analysts and
institutional investors that preceded its IPO, is a plan to parlay
its position in software into several derivative businesses.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is to make its Web site,  &LR; www.redhat.com, &LR;  into a
full-featured portal for Linux developers and users. In March,
according to the prospectus, the site attracted 265,000 unique
visitors. Linux's continuing popularity and the publicity the
company garnered last week undoubtedly mean increasing traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Red Hat aims to turn that into new revenues by selling ads on
its site and negotiating deals that give it a cut when users jump
from the site to make purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The second prong in Red Hat's plan _ one that likely will prove
more important over the long run _ is to beef up its consulting,
training and support programs.
</P>
<P>
   Red Hat already has agreements to provide such services to a
slew of other companies that recently have jumped on the Linux
bandwagon, including such giants as Compaq, Dell and IBM. In June,
Red Hat rolled out a new program under which it will offer on-site
services to corporate customers, provided by more than 350 Linux
experts based at 20 offices across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the company announced a deal under which Global
Knowledge, the world's largest provider of training for
information-technology professionals, will offer Red Hat's training
and certification programs.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, the company unveiled yet another program under
which it will offer training and support for developers creating
Linux-based software for corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   Red Hat won't have this field to itself _ the opportunity is too
lucrative. Last week, for example, IBM's Global Services unit
announced a wide-ranging service program to provide support and
services for businesses using Linux. And other companies with long
experience and established reputations in computing support and
services are sure to follow Big Blue's example.
</P>
<P>
   What Red Hat has going for it is its intimate knowledge of Linux
and the Linux developer community, which even corporate behemoths
like IBM can't match. It also has made its name into the best-known
brand in the emerging Linux market place.
</P>
<P>
   Whether those advantages make it a $5 billion company, only time
will tell.

Portals Are Climbing the Corporate Ladder
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; By Tom Stein
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
The World Wide Web, as most everyone knows, is a complex and often
confounding beast. So along came ``portal'' sites like Yahoo, Lycos
and Excite to act as a one-stop gateway to the billions of pages of
Internet content. In the process, these sites have become their own
little virtual communities where people gathered before leaping
onto the vastness of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many companies need to get their internal Web sites
organized in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few years, employees at large companies have used
internal Web sites, called intranets, to post information about
goings-on within the company. For example, the marketing department
might put up information about new hires while manufacturing would
post hundreds of pages about new production techniques. Literally
every employee could become a Web publisher. The end result was
that relevant information got buried deep within the intranet,
which itself became a wild and untamed beast.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the notion of ``corporate portals'' _ centralized home
pages organized to put all of a company's internal information at
its employees' fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate portals also let employees access data that exists
within a host of other applications on company servers, such as
e-mail, spreadsheets and word-processing documents. What's more,
the portals can link to the outside world. They can pull weather
reports, stock updates and breaking news off the Internet and
deliver it in a personalized manner directly to the employee's
desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Scient Corp., a San Francisco Internet consulting firm, has
spent millions of dollars in the past year building its corporate
portal, called the Scient Zone. To ensure that the investment
doesn't go to waste _ and that employees actually spend time in the
Zone rather than on Yahoo _ the company has added a series of fun
features to its portal.
</P>
<P>
   The home page has a weekly list of employees who are celebrating
a birthday, for instance. The site also features links to
employee-written reviews of local eating spots and watering holes.
There's even an area called, ``Hey, you stole my chair,'' where
people at the fast-growing and furniture-poor company accuse
co-workers of, you guessed it, stealing one another's chairs.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of PORTAL16 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Scient has 10 full-time staff members dedicated to enhancing and
monitoring the Scient Zone. They make sure that whatever content
employees post is easy to find.
</P>
<P>
   Portals can be tailored to meet the needs of a wide range of
workers, from secretaries to chief executives. Salespeople, for
instance, can personalize their portals to include the latest news
and developments about their customers and competitors. A CEO could
choose to see up-to-the minute business data, such as that week's
sales-per-region figures. This data could be garnered externally
from the Web or internally from the company's database and business
software applications.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, corporate portals allow employees to do their
jobs better, according to industry experts. For instance, some
portals sport templates that show new employees how to write a
proposal, conduct an interview with clients or create a PowerPoint
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America is starting to see the light. According to a
recent Gartner Group report, 80 percent of companies on the leading
edge of technology usage will implement a corporate portal by the
year 2000. More than half of the Fortune 300 companies are working
on _ or already have _ a corporate portal. And by 2003, a majority
of all businesses will manage a portal. Major companies such as
Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., Wells Fargo, Boeing and even the U.S. Postal
Service have embraced corporate portal technology.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, most companies build their portals from scratch. But
a host of vendors with names like Plumtree, Glyphica, Viador and
Epicentric are popping up to provide the technology in a single,
off-the-shelf package. They sell software to create the sites as
well as do a lot of the integration work to link together disparate
applications and data. Analysts estimate that there are about 15 to
20 such vendors in existence today, with many more sure to follow.
After all, a report by investment firm Merrill Lynch pegged the
market for portal vendors at $100 million, with projections for
double-digit growth during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Hadley Reynolds, an analyst with the Delphi Group, said more
companies will adopt corporate portals because the technology makes
a lot of sense. The portal is the first place employees go to post
messages and exchange ideas in organized chat rooms, he said,
predicting that eventually all work will be done within the
confines of the portal.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of PORTAL16 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``Today, we work in these highly fragmented and disconnected
software environments where we have to jump from one application to
another and one screen to another just to find a document or
retrieve a single piece of information,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the portal becomes the central repository for all
information and applications, enabling employees to work in one
centralized spot, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But for a corporate portal to be successful, it must be a place
where employees really want to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secret to success for a corporate portal is to have
sophisticated data integration, an intuitive user interface,
engaging content and easy navigation,'' Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   Scient works hard to keep its content engaging. A key part of
the Scient Zone is a link called Office Locator. It basically is a
map of the entire 400-person office. When you click on a particular
desk, you see a picture of the person who sits there, as well as
his or her resume, phone and e-mail information, current projects
and even more personal information such as favorite foods. The
office locator is effective particularly at a startup like Scient,
where new people are joining all the time and employees are eager
to get to know one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people may think we're wasting our time, but it's
essential to integrate this cultural stuff with the more critical
features for actually doing the job,'' said Doug Kalish, who heads
up development efforts for the Scient Zone. ``The Zone has to be
the first place we go for anything and everything. It is the mother
of our business. It's the place where people live all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., the San Francisco brokerage firm, began
building its so-called SchWEB portal two years ago. ``Before that,
it was a grassroots things with people publishing their own Web
content, but that soon became too unwieldy,'' said Bob Lee, a vice
president at Schwab. ``We formalized things with the creation of
the SchWEB,and now it really enhances the way people do their
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the SchWEB features industry news articles, a corporate
white-pages directory, stock updates, the latest information about
Schwab employees and locations, and links to the company's external
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The portal also has self-service features that allow workers to
sign up for the company's 401(k) plan, fill out expense reports,
order office supplies and report a change of address online.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said employees now spend an average of two hours a day
working directly on the SchWEB.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of loyalty, will we soon see companies sell
banner ads across their portals a la Yahoo and other commercial
sites? ``We are starting to get inquiries from companies who are
potentially looking at advertising revenue to offset the cost of
setting up a corporate portal,'' said Oliver Muoto, a co-founder of
portal software vendor Epicentric Inc. in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 3 of PORTAL16 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Doug Kalish, for one, could envision a series of rotating banners
with such corporate messages as ``Click here for an important
announcement from our CEO'' or ``This is the last day to sign up
for the 401(k) plan.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's not so keen on, say, a big, splashy ad from
1-800-Flowers racing the portal. ``I'm not sure our employees would
be real comfortable with that,'' he said.

ESTES ISN'T COUNTING ON RYDER CUP BERTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ Bob Estes stepped to the 16th tee box Sunday
with a berth on the U.S. Ryder Cup team if he could limit himself
to one bogey on the closing holes. Two bogeys later, the University
of Texas product found himself rationalizing the spot that got away
at Medinah Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one was expecting me to make the team, anyway,'' said
Estes, who fired a closing 69 in the PGA Championship and missed
becoming a Ryder Cup rookie by a single stroke. ``I knew where I
stood, in terms of the Ryder Cup. But I don't think it affected the
way I played those holes. Those holes had given me trouble all
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Estes' consecutive bogeys dropped him to 6 under par for the
tournament and into a tie for sixth at the PGA, the final
tournament where players earn points in the 1999 Ryder Cup
standings. If Estes had finished at 7 under, he would have joined
Nick Price in a two-way tie for fifth and leapfrogged Jeff Maggert
for the 10th and final automatic berth on the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Austin resident must wait and see if U.S. captain Ben
Crenshaw, a fellow Longhorn and Austin resident, will select him
today as one of two at-large choices for the team that will compete
Sept. 24-26 in Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Ryder Cup bubble-riders, Estes turned in the most
impressive showing at the PGA. He moved from 15th to 11th in the
final Ryder Cup standings with 611.25 points _ 13.75 fewer than
Maggert, a Texas A&AMP;M product who lives in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Twice this season, Estes has cracked the top 10 in major
championships. In addition to finishing sixth at the PGA, he was
fourth at the Masters. But he has only one career victory (1994
Texas Open) and no experience in international team competition.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Estes said he expects to be bypassed in favor of
two more experienced players who rank below him in the Ryder Cup
standings when Crenshaw announces his at-large picks. Most
speculation has centered around Tom Lehman (No. 12), a two-time
Ryder Cup participant, and Fred Couples (No. 17), a five-time Cup
competitor, as Crenshaw's probable at-large picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I even have a chance,'' Estes said. ``I don't
have the experience of Couples and Lehman.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples, an at-large pick in 1997, openly lobbied for a spot
Sunday after shooting a closing 72.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I be disappointed if I'm not picked? Sure,'' said
Couples, who spoke with Crenshaw after his round. ``I feel like I
hit a lot of good shots this week. What I have going for me is
experience, and sometimes you can't keep relying on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, in the estimation of peers, is a lock. Fort Worth
resident Mark Brooks said Lehman should be ``a slam dunk'' choice
as an at-large pick. But he said he would pick Estes over Couples,
if put in Crenshaw's position.
</P>
<P>
   What will Crenshaw do?
</P>
<P>
   ``One pick is probably fairly obvious, and one will probably
keep me up all night,'' Crenshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, by all accounts, figures to be the obvious choice.
Estes, by his calculations, probably blew his best chance by
hitting consecutive tee shots into the trees at No. 16 and into a
bunker at No. 17. Both set up pivotal bogeys. Neither, said Estes,
will haunt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave it my best shot,'' he said. ``That's all you can do.''

 FAMILY OF 3 KILLED IN PLANE CRASH
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DANIEL VASQUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Signs of trouble came just eight minutes after the small plane
belonging to a Pennsylvania family lifted off Saturday at
Morrisville Airport in Vermont. The aircraft's emergency beacon
went off and the plane was not heard from again.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, authorities confirmed the worst: The family of three,
including an 11-year-old boy, were killed after their Cessna 210
crashed into the Putnam State Forest near the Worcester Mountain
Ridgeline in northern Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Lehman, 43, his wife, Joanne, 48, their son, Nathan, and
pet golden retriever, died in the plane crash about 10 miles from
the Morrisville Airport as the family headed home to Mechanicsburg,
Pa., police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears the plane burst into flames upon impact'' said
Vermont State Police Sergeant Bruce Melendy, in a statement
released Sunday. The Vermont State Police was one of several
agencies that began searching for the family after the Cessna's
emergency beacon went off at 1:08 p.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On their flight, the Lehmans said they intended to land at
Capital City Airport in their hometown. The Lehmans took off just
after 1 p.m. and about five minutes later Dennis Lehman, who was
piloting the craft, radioed a request to climb to 6,000 feet over
Boston, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes later, the plane's beacon went off. A Federal
Aviation Administration official at the Knapp Airport in Berlin,
Vt., tracked the plane's signal for about 10 minutes _ but the
family never made contact again, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Local rescue workers, including firefighters and police,
unsuccessfully searched the highways and roads near Morrisville on
Saturday. Meanwhile, the Civil Air Patrol and Vermont National
Guard searched by plane until midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Then about 1:20 p.m. Sunday searchers using dogs found pieces of
the black, gold and white plane in the Putnam State Forest area.

   ATLANTA _ Celestine Sibley, whose column ran in The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution newspapers for 55 years, died early Sunday
morning at her beachside retreat on Dog Island, Fla. She was 85.
</P>
<P>
   She had undergone surgery for breast cancer in 1995 and suffered
a heart attack in 1998. She learned late last year that her cancer
had returned. This time it spread to her brain and bones.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best-loved and most prolific writers in the history
of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Sibley captured everyday life
in the changing South in more than 10,000 columns since 1944.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celestine was one of the true giants,'' said Georgia Gov. Roy
Barnes. ``She had one of the biggest hearts of any person that I
ever knew. She knew the secrets on all of us in the General
Assembly, and we were comfortable that she knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Ashmead, Sibley's book editor at Harper Collins, said,
``A light's gone out in Atlanta and Georgia and all over the South,
where people read her and loved her.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Ashmead, ``I'm sort of glad she died on Dog Island, the
place she and Jack (her late husband Jack Strong) loved the most of
all the places they had.''
</P>
<P>
   Born near Pensacola, Fla., Sibley was reared in the turpentine
country north of Mobile, Ala. She came to work at The Atlanta
Constitution in 1941. Though best known for the columns she wrote
from 1944 until shortly before her death, she was a star court
reporter and also covered politics and the Georgia Legislature. She
raised three children while holding down a full-time job,
free-lancing magazine articles and writing 25 books.
</P>
<P>
   According to her daughter Mary Vance, Sibley was alert just
before she died around 5:30 Sunday morning. In her last moments she
asked whether they might return to her Sweet Apple cabin in
Roswell, Ga., one last time, explaining that, ``There are a couple
of things I wanted to do in the garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Sibley's wishes were observed, due to a personality that
remained forceful to the end. Sibley underwent chemotherapy after a
mastectomy in 1995. When cancer recurred in 1998, she announced,
``with equanimity and some dignity,'' that she would endure no more
chemotherapy, said her oncologist Dr. Martin York. ``Through it
all, she had this remarkable independence and sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Patricia Templeton, associate rector of St. Timothy's
Episcopal Church in Signal Mountain, Tennessee, said, ``She
approached her death the way she lived her life: With courage and
grace and stubbornness.'' Templeton is to officiate at a memorial
service for her longtime friend. Plans for that service were to be
announced later today.
</P>
<P>
   Templeton served as an intern at The Atlanta Constitution in
1976, before she turned to the ministry, and still keeps a clipping
of a Sibley column from that summer. In the column, Sibley writes
of a fierce love of newspapering, saying, ``I can honestly say that
there has been nothing in my life so painful and saddening that it
wasn't eased a little bit as I walked toward my job in a newspaper
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Martin, editor of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, said
Sunday, ``Those of us who were fortunate to work with her will miss
her laughter, her wisdom and her example. Her column was Celestine
herself _ an oasis, where you could share a quiet moment, recover
your perspective, and leave refreshed, ready to journey on. It's
hard to imagine the paper without her.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Cumming of Carrollton, Ga., used Sibley's columns when he
taught at West Georgia College, and cherished a friendship that
began in 1957 when he was at Newsweek's Southern bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always thought of her in heroic terms,'' Cumming said.
``She had all the strength of the Statue of Liberty, only with a
sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Sibley and former Georgia Gov. Zell Miller were friends from the
years when she covered the Legislature and he was a young lawmaker.
``I always looked upon her as a wise aunt, who would encourage you
with warmth and gentleness,'' Miller said. ``She taught us how to
face our later years: With dignity, with humor, and occasionally a
little bit of irritability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved her very much,'' said Miller, ``and, gosh, I'm going
to miss her, but so will thousands of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include her son, James W. Little V of Alford, Fla.;
two daughters, Susan Sibley Little Bazemore of Des Moines, Iowa
(formerly of Omaha, Neb.), and Mary Everitt Little-Vance of
Roswell; eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of flowers, the family asks that contributions be sent
to the library of their choice or to Trees Atlanta.

SERGIO GARCIA BECOMES A FAN FAVORITE DOWN STRETCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ By finishing first at the PGA Championship,
Tiger Woods regained the No. 1 spot in the world golf rankings. But
he was clearly No. 2 Sunday in the hearts of fans at Medinah
Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Garcia, the Spanish teen-ager who finished as the
runner-up to Woods, received the lion's share of the cheers at
Medinah. Woods, in fact, was jeered on multiple occasions.
</P>
<P>
   At various points, Woods and playing partner Mike Weir were
urged to ``choke'' by onlookers. Woods was encouraged to hit tee
shots into the water at Nos. 13 and 17, a pair of water-lined par-3
holes. As Woods lined up a birdie putt at No. 18, several different
fans hollered ``Three-putt!,'' an occurrence that would have forced
Woods into a playoff with Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the things they said weren't too kind,'' Woods said,
adding that none of the marks were racial slurs. ``Fans obviously
were rooting for Sergio, as well they should. Some of the things
they did to Mike and I, I don't think was fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, on the other hand, said he ``felt like I was an
American'' during the closing holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowds were amazing. I have no words to say what that did
for me,'' said Garcia, 19, who became the obvious rooting favorite
after closing Woods' five-shot lead to one with a birdie at No. 13.
``I almost couldn't hear by the end of the round.'' JOBE MISSES BIG
PAYDAY
</P>
<P>
   A disappointing final round (75) dropped Southlake resident
Brandt Jobe into a tie for 16th place at Medinah, decreasing a
potential six-digit paycheck to $48,600. Jobe, who competes on the
Japanese Tour, seeks to finish in the top 125 on the PGA Tour
season money list so that he can play full time in the United
States next season.
</P>
<P>
   His earnings at Medinah boost Jobe's season total to $168,600,
putting him within striking distance of the $300,000 he estimates
he will need to earn a PGA Tour card for 2000. But Jobe, who
entered the final round in ninth place, had hoped for more at
Medinah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed. I played better than my score would
indicate,'' said Jobe, who took a double-bogey from a plugged lie
at No. 12 and also bogeyed the par-5 14th to backtrack to 1 under
for the tournament. ``When I needed one bounce to happen, it never
happened for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the problem for Jobe will be adding to his earnings figure
after August.
</P>
<P>
   A nonmember of the tour, he has been given sponsor's exemptions
into events the next two weeks (Sprint International, Reno-Tahoe
Open). After that, he is at the mercy of tournament organizers to
play in additional PGA Tour events. That is why a letter will be in
the mail soon to organizers of the Westin Texas Open, played Sept.
23-26 in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell them I'm a local now. Maybe that will help,'' said
Jobe, who moved from Denver to Southlake during the summer. ``The
way I'm going, maybe one more good finish will give me my card.''
PUTTER DESERTS BROOKS
</P>
<P>
   A balky putter kept Fort Worth resident Mark Brooks from making
a final-round charge at the PGA. Brooks, who finished at 1 under,
needed 33 putts Sunday _ five more than his average during the
first three rounds. Brooks closed with a 74 and finished in a tie
for 16th, his best showing at a major since winning the 1996 PGA.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Medinah, Brooks had missed the cut in six of his
past 11 majors, with a best finish of 38th at the 1999 Masters.
Despite the putting problems, he remained upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, I played well. I just couldn't get the speed down,''
said Brooks, who had two three-putts Sunday. ``The greens were a
little faster than they'd been the rest of the week.'' BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Mike Weir, Tiger Woods' playing partner, on problems
experienced during Sunday's closing 80: ``There was nothing with
the gallery or Tiger. It was just me. I just wasn't sharp, all the
way around.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Woods (23 years, 8 months, 16 days) became the fifth-youngest
winner in PGA history. Garcia, 19, is the youngest runner-up in
tournament history. nn

TEXAS LONGHORNS PREPARING FOR POST-RICKY ERA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ While plotting a suitable encore to a season
that produced a Cotton Bowl victory, a Heisman Trophy winner and
thousands of delirious Texas fans, Mack Brown has located a
comforting starting point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' he said. ``By Wednesday, we'd already sold
45,500 season tickets, and that breaks the old record (39,000) by a
bunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just so encouraging. What last year did for us was it
put us back in the national spotlight and allowed us to walk with a
swagger again. What this does is it sends a message that even
though Ricky Williams is gone, people still care about Texas
football.''
</P>
<P>
   They might find certain aspects of it unfamiliar for awhile.
Along with Williams _ who rushed for 2,124 yards and finished his
career as the most prolific runner (6,279 yards) in NCAA Division
I-A history _ graduation removed premier receiver Wane McGarity and
four immense starters in the offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year,'' Brown said, ``We will be more inclined to spread
the field and take what the defense gives us. Ricky allowed us to
be stubborn. This year, we will not be stubborn. Other than that,
not much changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with a few questions, there are two aspects of the offense
about which the coaching staff is certain: (a) Major Applewhite is
the starting quarterback, never mind what you have heard about
incoming freshman Chris Simms, and (b) Williams will be replaced by
junior Hodges Mitchell and redshirt freshman Victor Ike.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the latter situation, offensive coordinator Greg Davis
said he feels comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hodges will be our starter, but Victor is definitely going to
play,'' he said. ``We'll be fine, because they're both very
talented. In fact, Hodges is _ careful how you print this _ better
than Ricky was in some aspects of the receiving game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, the thing with Ricky is, it's probably bigger with the
media than it is with us. He's gone. And the thing about sports is,
when they're gone, that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, who has set a goal of 1,000 yards for himself, said he
feels OK, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't think Ricky will ever be ``gone'','' he said.
``Those are the biggest shoes in the country to fill, but I don't
feel pressure because of it. For me, pressure comes from what I
expect of myself. He's the greatest back I've ever been around, and
I learned some things: The main thing he taught me is, you've got
to run hard at those linebackers, and it's no time to be mincing
steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who in his time has coached Gary Kubiak, Kevin Murray,
Barry Lunney and Rocky Zeier, calls Simms _ national offensive
player of the year in ``USA Today'' _ ``The best freshman
quarterback I've seen in 27 years.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the moment, he isn't as good as Applewhite, who threw for
2,453 yards and 18 touchdowns as a redshirt freshman while guiding
the Longhorns to a 9-3 year capped by a 38-11 victory over
Mississippi State in the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both looking good, but Major has really picked up his
game,'' Davis said. ``Frankly, I like the fact that Chris wants to
be the starter _ and that Major doesn't want him to be the
starter.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the two are getting along well, Applewhite said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself the starter, but he's a teammate, and it's
part of my job to help him if I can and answer any questions he
has,'' Applewhite said. ``So far, most of his questions have been
like, `Where's the nearest drug store?''' nn

AFTER TOURNAMENT, WILLIAMS MAKES IMPORTANT STOP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ Serena Williams has a long-term plan
to be ranked No. 1. Her short-term plan, however, is more simple:
``The first stop will be the jewelry store,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After Williams won the Acura Classic 6-1, 6-4 against Julie
Halard-Decugis, the 17-year-old talked about jewelry. As her
winnings moved to $580,015 this year, fifth highest on the WTA
Tour, she can afford trinkets in Mr. T proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Williams talked about a nearby jewelry store in Manhattan Beach
all week and has her eye on a necklace with many gems, including
garnet, amethyst, topaz and blue topaz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really different design,'' Williams said. ``It goes all
the way around and looks like a bracelet.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who wears a gold necklace and bracelet on the court,
probably won't wear the necklace in a match. But considering her
desire for it, she might be wearing it soon, as a college freshman.
</P>
<P>
   __ Finalists jump: Both Williams and Halard-Decugis will jump in
the WTA Tour rankings to be released today. Williams will move from
11th to ninth; Halard-Decugis from 16th to 11th. Both rankings are
the highest in their respective careers.
</P>
<P>
   Halard-Decugis, 28, said she is playing the best tennis of her
13-year pro career. She returned to the tour in 1998 after a
variety of injuries kept her out for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``During all that time, I did a lot of physical training,''
Halard-Decugis said of the layoff. ``I'm enjoying the tour much
more. I'm having more fun on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Williams drives away:Williams received $80,000 for her
victory, and Halard-Decugis got $40,000 in the $520,000 tournament.
As a bonus, Williams also received a an Acura TL.
</P>
<P>
   __ Attendance booms:The tournament set an attendance record with
53,713 for the week. The finals and semifinals were sold out,
filling the 5,324-seat stadium.
</P>
<P>
   __ TV time travels:The final was broadcast on NBC, after a
one-hour tape delay. The final ceremonies also were broadcast,
which caused an awkward silence. Officials waited for a commercial
break to end without saying a word to the crowd, before presenting
the players with their awards.
</P>
<P>
   __ Neiland/Sanchez-Vicario win:In the anti-climactic doubles
final, Larisa Neiland and Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario beat No. 3 Lisa
Raymond/Rennae Stubbs 6-2, 6-7 (4-7), 6-0. Neiland and
Sanchez-Vicario aren't exactly known for their doubles. They are
ranked 17th and 19th, respectively. Martina Hingis and Natasha
Zvereva are the top-ranked doubles players.

   LAFAYETTE, La. _ Two weeks might seem a long time for seven of
Minus Granger's long-lost cousins to stay with him at his home. But
that does not take into consideration how far they traveled _ from
Canada and France. And it also does not take into consideration how
much catching up they had to do _ almost 400 years' worth.
</P>
<P>
   They call one another cousins, but they have to go back to the
17th century to find a common ancestor: Laurent Granger (pronounced
grahn-JAY), who emigrated in 1657 from Europe to Acadia, an area
that encompassed present-day Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince
Edward Island as well as parts of Quebec and northern Maine. He
married Marie Landry there in 1667, and so began the generational
links to these present-day Grangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Grangers were not the only distant descendants of Acadians
coming together in the Cajun region of southwest Louisiana over the
past two weeks. From July 31 until Sunday, thousands of descendants
from 81 families with names like LeBlanc, Broussard and Thibodeaux
have been convening in towns throughout a 22-parish region of
Louisiana called Acadiana, which is bounded by Lake Charles, the
Atchafalaya Basin and Ville Platte.
</P>
<P>
   They traveled from all over the United States and from Canada
and France to take part in the second Congres Mondial Acadien
(World Acadian Congress), a bilingual cultural celebration designed
to restore some pride and unity to a beleaguered people ripped
apart nearly 250 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The gatherings bring together the descendants of families
expelled in the 1750s by the British government from the land they
called Acadie. The first Congress was held in Canada in 1994 and
drew nearly 225,000 people, including some 3,000 from Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Collete LeGac, 49, traveled here with her husband, Yves, 52,
from Belle-Isle en Mer, France, off the coast of Brittany, where
her mother's Granger ancestors resettled after they were expelled
from Acadia.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. LeGac attended the 1994 congress, where she met Minus
Granger, 75, her Cajun host, and her five fellow house guests, all
of whom are from Canada. Speaking French, with Granger and the
Canadians translating, Ms. LeGac pointed out that every major
region where Acadians now live _ Louisiana, Canada and France _ was
represented at Granger's dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shows that even though our ancestors suffered being
dispersed to distant places, we will always be able to find
ourselves again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Acadians began immigrating to the New World from France in
the early 1600s. But Britain took control of the region from France
in the early 1700s and, viewing the Acadians as a threat during the
French and Indian War, dispersed them through its American colonies
starting in 1755. Men were separated from their families. Many
Acadians, young and old, died at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Ms. LeGac's ancestors, were sent to England and held
as prisoners, eventually escaping to France. A few managed to stay
behind in present-day Canada, where they hid in remote regions.
</P>
<P>
   Those who ended up in the 13 colonies felt unwelcome, and many
eventually traveled to western Louisiana, where some of the
deportees who had escaped to France joined them in the late 1700s.
They soon established a new Acadian settlement here, which evolved
into Cajun culture as it is known today. The word ``Cajun'' is an
English variation of ``Acadian.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still family,'' Minus Granger said, motioning toward
his guests, ``after so many years of being separated.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Next to him, Michel Granger, 54, a teacher from Calgary,
Alberta, spoke about the troubles faced by his ancestors who stayed
in Canada and often felt the need to hide their heritage. ``For a
long time, if you were an Acadian in Canada, you were a
nonperson,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cajuns in Louisiana also faced persecution. Minus Granger
and others said they were punished for not speaking English in
school.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of this year's Congres Mondial Acadien was the
network of 56 family reunions in community centers, American Legion
halls and coliseums throughout Acadiana. Each reunion drew anywhere
from a few hundred to nearly 2,000 participants.
</P>
<P>
   Many who had traveled here from France and Canada were
especially impressed by the music, dancing and food. But an equally
popular feature was the genealogical areas set up at each reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Family members manned computer databases and tables of official
family records to help their namesake cousins find their own
particular lineage. Many had first learned about the reunions from
Internet genealogical searches. Displays of family photographs and
intricately detailed family trees filled walls and tables.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case at the joint Babineaux-Granger reunion, held
at the civic center in Rayne, west of Lafayette, where more than
800 people showed up. Like Minus Granger and his house guests, they
were all descended from Laurent Granger, whose daughter Marie
Marguerite married the first Babineaux to migrate to Acadia.
</P>
<P>
   Among Laurent's notable Cajun descendants is Louisiana's current
lieutenant governor, Kathleen Babineaux Blanco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can fully realize the impact of that time
when our ancestors were expelled from the shores of Canada,'' Ms.
Blanco said in a speech. ``But they endured. And when you think
about it, our grandmothers and grandfathers had to be really tough
people to be able to make it. They survived and obviously thrived,
no matter where they were. So that is our heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Granger cousins all seemed to have arrived at a sense of
wonder during their visit, impressed by how many people have
connected with one another and formed family bonds through their
ties to distant relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The English wished to erase Acadian life from the world,''
said another of Minus Granger's house guests, Pierre Granger, 60, a
cardiologist from Quebec. ``But I am actually grateful to them in a
way. Because instead of erasing it, they multiplied it. And now
instead of one homeland, we have many.''

2 PLAYERS REMAIN TO BE NAMED TO U.S. RYDER CUP TEAM
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ The top 10 players on the U.S. Ryder Cup team
are set, leaving Ben Crenshaw to announce his two captains picks on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw will almost surely name Tom Lehman, who finished 12th
in the points race, with one of the two captain's pick. The second
pick will be more difficult, although Fred Couples, a Ryder Cup
veteran who finished 17th in the points race, is probably the
favorite. Bob Estes, Steve Stricker, Steve Pate, John Huston, and
Chris Perry will also receive consideration.
</P>
<P>
   he 10 players who clinched spots through Sunday's PGA
Championship are Tiger Woods., David Duval, Payne Stewart, Davis
Love 3rd, Mark O'Meara, Hal Sutton, Justin Leonard, Jim Furyk, Phil
Mickelson, and Jeff Maggert.
</P>
<P>
   Couples was hoping for the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never told anyone I didn't want to be on the team,'' said
Couples. ``That's something everyone wants to make. I'm sure
everyone is hoping for a call.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his chances to be chosen, Pate said, ``Very
unlikely, but not out of the question. ``I haven't talked to Ben.
It's not my place. But I would love it. It's the first chance I've
had to do this in eight years, and who knows how often your chances
come along. I'm sure I'm being considered, but so are a lot of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   DUVAL SLIPS FROM TOP RANKING
</P>
<P>
   David Duval lost his No. 1 world ranking to Tiger Woods
following Sunday's outcome, and Duval will have to wait another
year to win his first major championship after finishing tied for
10th place, 3-under par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play as well as I would have liked,'' said Duval. ``I
hit the ball pretty well. I putted poorly and failed to get the
ball in the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   SINGH DISAPPOINTED
</P>
<P>
   Vijay Singh, the defending PGA Champion, was never in
contention, and he finished at 5-over par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed,'' said Singh. ``I thought I was going
to play a little better. The one consolation is that I got to play
the weekend. The way I started off Thursday, I thought I was going
to struggle to make the cut. I'm disappointed that I didn't contend
for the title.''
</P>
<P>
   DOUBLE-BOGEY COSTS PRICE
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price got to within three strokes of Tiger Woods, but a
costly double-bogey at No. 16 forced him to settle for fifth place
at 7-under par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was going to have to have a mistake free round to
have a chance,'' said Price. ``I just made too many bogeys this
week, to many mistakes. My game is in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 42, Price has remained one of the game's most consistent
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing for the older guys is the question of
whether or not you have the desire,'' said Price. ``It's hard to
look at the suitcase every week. I'm trying not to play too much so
that I don't lose my desire.''
</P>
<P>
   GARCIA MAKES THE RYDER TEAM
</P>
<P>
   Mark James, the European Ryder Cup captain, doesn't have to
worry about picking Sergio Garcia now that he has made the team on
his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is obviously a huge talent,'' said James of Garcia.
``The way he has played over in the States is incredible. To play
these tournaments at his age so maturely is quite unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   The big question for James, who must decide on his two captain's
picks on Aug. 24, is whether to select Nick Faldo, who has
struggled for the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nick knows that to be considered, he has to show some form,''
said James. ``I would love to have form from Faldo, from Ian
Woosnam, and from Seve Ballesteros. If they're not going to be
there, they're not going to be there. There comes a time when
everyone has to move over, and if it's that year, so be it.''

IRABU LOSES CONTROL OF HIS SPLITTER
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hideki Irabu raised his hand to imitate how he held
the ball, jutting the heel of his palm forward a bit, spreading his
fingers just so, struggling Sunday to explain the ephemeral feeling
he was supposed to have when he throws his splitter.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu spent his start against the Minnesota Twins in search of
that feeling, abandoning the routine of throwing a little of
everything when warming up between innings, instead throwing
splitter after splitter trying to find his range. The splitter
requires a lighter touch, and when Irabu's is working, he throws it
in the low to mid-80s. Sunday, he was higher up on the radar gun
and Irabu allowed five runs on nine hits in 6 1/3 innings in the
5-3 loss to the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   It was Irabu's first loss since May 25, a span during which he
recorded eight victories in 13 starts. But of more concern was
Irabu's loss of control of one of his favored pitches. Until last
week, Irabu had been, after David Cone, the most consistent starter
the Yankees have had in a season in which Roger Clemens has
curiously been un-Clemenslike. But Joe Torre said Irabu had not had
the splitter for the last few starts _ including his last one, when
he was bombed by Oakland, leaving after just four innings in which
he gave up eight hits and six runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is something to worry about, it's the feeling,''
Irabu said. ``That's what I need to worry about. I have confidence
in it. It's a matter of feeling, how you feel when you throw it.
It's the meaning and intent with which you throw it.''
</P>
<P>
   Irabu's search for meaning was fruitless Sunday. With the
splitter staying up in the zone, he had trouble putting batters
away. Of the nine hits he surrendered, five of them came when he
had two strikes.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, with the score tied, 1-1, Irabu gave up a
leadoff double to Ron Coomer. Corey Koskie's groundout moved Coomer
to third and Terry Steinbach, with an 0-2 count and the infield
pulled in, hit a squibber under a diving Tino Martinez to give the
Twins a 2-1 lead. The next hitter, Denny Hocking was also in the
hole, 0-2, before hitting a single. Both hits came off splitters.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh inning, with two on and one out, Marty Cordova
hit an 0-2 fastball into left-center that scored two runs and sent
Irabu to the shower. Irabu got ahead in the count by starting his
fastball low and trying to go up in the zone. It worked twice. But
on what he hoped would be the third strike, the ball hung over the
middle of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no command, and it wasn't breaking,'' Torre said of the
splitter. ``He was leaving it up in the strike zone. The last two
or three starts it's been that way. He was able to get ahead in the
count today _ that was the frustrating part of it. He made too many
mistakes with the two-strike pitch. Those are the ones that
shouldn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Irabu seemed unfazed afterward, perhaps because he has rebounded
from a disastrous spring training in which he was the target of an
insult from George Steinbrenner to have a surprisingly strong
season.
</P>
<P>
   But Irabu did not pitch in the post-season last year because,
after getting off to a good start _ he went 9-3, with a 2.86 ERA in
his first 17 starts of 1998 _ he faltered in his last 11, going 4-6
with a 5.91 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   This season, he was 9-3 with a 4.07 ERA before Sunday's game and
has now been hit hard in his last two starts. Irabu admitted Sunday
he had hoped to protect his no-loss streak but there was little
regret and certainly no panic in his voice. There was only
befuddlement and a commitment to continue with the things that had
helped him start the streak in the first place. The playoffs, he
said, he would worry about late in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than being satisfied, I want to be consistent,'' Irabu
said. ``I want to keep working on my conditioning. I have about 10
more starts left and I just have to do well in those starts. I have
some things I need to work on and solve in the next 10 starts.
Until I work on those things, I can't worry about anything else.''

LOAIZA DISPLAYS ACE FORM, LEADS RANGERS PAST WHITE SOX
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Esteban Loaiza is technically the Rangers' fifth
starter. Sunday, he did a fine impression of a staff ace.
</P>
<P>
   Riding to the rescue of his reeling teammates, Loaiza put a stop
to the Rangers' four-game losing streak with eight scoreless
innings and beat the Chicago White Sox, 10-0, at Comiskey Park.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza threw 126 pitches, which kept manager Johnny Oates from
sending him out for the ninth inning and getting his second career
shutout. But Dan Kolb held the White Sox scoreless in the ninth to
give the Rangers their fifth shutout this season.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Loaiza's performance allowed the Rangers to
maintain their 41/2 game lead in the American League West because
the Oakland Athletics completed a three-game sweep of the Toronto
Blue Jays with a 9-5 victory at SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers open a four-game series against the Cleveland
Indians tonight and weren't too thrilled about the possibility of
taking a five-game losing streak to Jacobs Field. Loaiza helped the
Rangers avoid that, not to mention 16 hits from the offense,
including two home runs from both Rusty Greer and Ivan Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important for us to come out and play well today,''
Greer said. ``We haven't been playing bad baseball but we haven't
played winning baseball, either. Cleveland is a tough place to
play, so we needed to come out of here with a win. But it all
starts with pitching, and Esteban pitched a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory also left Loaiza 5-0 with a 2.97 earned-run average
in his past six games, including five starts. After being banished
to the bullpen and missing much of the first half with a broken
hand, Loaiza is finally pitching the way the Rangers expected when
they acquired him July 17 last year for second baseman Warren
Morris and pitcher Todd Van Poppel.
</P>
<P>
   With Morris competing for National League rookie of the year,
the trade was starting to look like a Pirates swindle until this
latest surge by Loaiza.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consistency he's giving us, that's what you want,'' Oates
said. ``I'd much rather have consistently average than a no-hitter
one game and getting knocked out the next. That gets you 50
percent, and 50 percent is not going to win you anything. He's
given us a chance to win five games.''
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza was not only good Sunday, but he was smart and tough. But
perhaps a near-brush with death will do that. His day almost ended
prematurely in the first inning when Frank Thomas ripped a line
drive straight back at Loaiza's skull. But Loaiza, with an
impressive survival instincts, got his glove up and made the catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucky I caught it, or I'd probably be in the hospital,''
Loaiza said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he stayed around and held the White Sox to five hits
and a walk over eight innings. The White Sox did threaten by
getting runners to second base with one out in each of the third
through sixth innings. But Loaiza, mixing in off-speed pitches with
his fastball, held the White Sox to a collective 0-for-8 with
runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to go hard, hit my spots and throw strikes,''
Loaiza said. ``When I was a reliever, I threw hard all the time.
Now I'm mixing my pitches. That's what's working for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza finished strong, retiring the last nine hitters he faced.
But Oates keeps his starters on a relatively strict 120-pitch limit
and called on Kolb for the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I wanted to finish,'' Loaiza said. ``But Johnny said 120
pitches, it's time to get ready for my next start. I can't say much
but I really wanted to go back out there.''
</P>
<P>
   What he did was plenty for a struggling team. nn

POLICE CHIEFS JOIN IN CALL FOR MORE DNA SAMPLING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Mich.)  (lb) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The leadership of a worldwide association of police
agencies has called for collecting DNA samples from all crime
suspects as soon as they are arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution was pushed by New York City's police
commissioner, Howard Safir, who told the group's executive board
that collecting DNA from suspects when they were arrested was much
more important than collecting it just from some felons after they
were convicted, because the broader database would solve more
crimes before the criminals it uncovered could strike again.
</P>
<P>
   Safir is a member of the executive committee of the group, the
International Association of Chiefs of Police. The committee
unanimously endorsed a resolution calling on the federal and state
governments to pass broad DNA collection plans at a meeting at New
York City Police Headquarters on Saturday. Safir proposed such a
procedure for the city last year.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials at the association's meeting said the
expansion of New York state's database of convicts would help catch
some suspects who had serious felony convictions. But officials
said they needed to collect DNA at arrests to catch more violent
criminals after their first serious offense.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said the value of a broad DNA database was demonstrated by
the case of a man who this year was accused of sexually assaulting
51 women in the Bronx over five years. If the early collection plan
had been in place, the commissioner said, the police would have had
DNA from the suspect, who had a criminal record, on file. They
would then have been able to identify him after the first attack,
Safir said, and ``we would have had 50 less rapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir said in an interview that he supported destruction of DNA
samples after they were entered into a database so they could not
be used to disseminate detailed genetic information on suspects.
The limited information taken from a DNA sample and put into a
database is sufficient to allow law-enforcement officials to match
against a sample, like one collected at a crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner also said that under his plan, information put
in the database would be removed if charges were dropped or a
suspect was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed early collection procedure goes far beyond a DNA
database program passed by the New York state Legislature earlier
this month. The state program will require felons convicted of any
of a long list of crimes, including murder, manslaughter, sexual
assault, robbery and burglary, to provide DNA samples. Most other
states collect DNA samples only from limited categories of
convicted criminals, usually including sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a terrific first step,'' Safir said of the new
state program. ``But we need more.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, who had expressed misgivings about possible abuses
of privacy even in a DNA collection program limited to convicted
felons, said civil libertarians would vigorously oppose collection
from unconvicted suspects.
</P>
<P>
   He said the association's proposal ``underscores the threat to
civil liberties posed by the potential use of DNA by
law-enforcement zealots.'' He maintained that Safir's proposal
``ignores privacy concerns and violates fundamental Fourth
Amendment principles that protect individual privacy from
unreasonable searches and seizures by police agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In less than a decade,'' he said, ``we seem to be moving from
collecting DNA from convicted killers to the collection of those
samples from the innocent.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Siegel said that broader collection laws would be more
vulnerable to legal attacks than laws limited to the kinds of
offenders most likely to be recidivists.
</P>
<P>
   But the action by the influential police chiefs' group provides
support for broader collection measures.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution was ``a clear mandate'' from the association's
leadership supporting the expansion of the use of DNA as a tool for
law enforcement, said Ronald Nueber, the president of the
association, which represents 12,500 police agencies in 112
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do a better job of taking advantage of tools that
make it easier for law enforcement to solve crimes, and DNA
collection is a very important tool for that end,'' added Nueber,
who is the chief of police in St. Peters, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good move,'' said James McMahon, the superintendent
of the New York State Police, who is also a member of the
association's executive committee.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution urges the federal government to create a national
DNA database based on samples collected at the time of arrest, a
concept that the Justice Department is studying. The resolution
also called on states to pass laws supporting DNA collection at
arrest.

TANG TSOU, 80, AUTHORITY ON MODERN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (lb) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tang Tsou, an authority on modern China and a longtime professor
at the University of Chicago, died on Aug. 7 at a hospital in
Chicago. He was 80 and lived in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, said William Harms of the
university's news office.
</P>
<P>
   Tsou retired from the university in 1988 as the Homer J.
Livingston professor in political science. He began as an assistant
professor in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tang Tsou was a brilliant scholar whose contribution to the
understanding of China was enormous,'' said Michel Oksenberg, a
political scientist who is a senior fellow at the Asia Pacific
Research Center at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   Oksenberg called Tsou ``a seminal thinker who sought to
understand the dynamics of Chinese politics and how those politics
embrace the Chinese intellectual tradition, its social fabric and
its modern history.''
</P>
<P>
   His book ``The Cultural Revolution and Post-Mao Reforms: A
Historical Perspective'' (University of Chicago, 1986), a
collection of eight papers that he wrote between 1967 and 1983, was
praised in a review by Anne Collier in The Christian Science
Monitor as ``valuable to both scholar and lay person in its
capsulizing of historical events while giving them a theoretical
context.''
</P>
<P>
   He won particular praise, as well as criticism, for his book
``America's Failure in China, 1941-1950'' (1963).
</P>
<P>
   It was applauded in a review in The New York Times Book Review
by Henry R. Lieberman, an editor at The Times who had been a Far
East correspondent for many years. He wrote, ``This is a balanced,
scholarly and sobering work that helps set the record clear on
United States relations with China from the time of Pearl Harbor to
General MacArthur's ill-fated advance to the Yalu in Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   The book's main thesis was that the failure of U.S. policy in
China had stemmed from an imbalance between ambitious goals and
insufficient means. But Lieberman said the situation in China was
more complicated than Tsou had suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, as Dali Yang, another University of Chicago
political scientist, put it, Tsou's position in the book ``was that
the nationalist government lost to the communists in the Chinese
civil war because the nationalist government was corrupt and riven
by infighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Tsou was also a co-editor of the two-volume work ``China in
Crisis'' (1968). That work, comprising essays by 28 authors and 39
critical commentaries and responses, was praised in a review by
Jonathan Spence, a Yale history professor. He said, ``It
constitutes the most comprehensive and the most intelligent attempt
yet made to survey the Chinese communist political system.''
</P>
<P>
   Tsou was born in Guangzhou and received a bachelor's degree in
1940 from National Southwestern Associated University in Kunming
and his doctorate in 1951 from the University of Chicago, where he
arrived as a student in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Yi-Chuang Lu.

   During a recent lunch at the Stage Delicatessen, I was served by
a waitress who called me ``Sweetie,'' ``Love'' and ``Bubeleh'' as

   Taking the subway during a recent morning rush hour on my way to
work on 35th Street, I had nothing to hold on to other than the
bodies of people in front of and behind me. A woman frowned at me
as we bumped into each other. To demonstrate my vulnerable
position, I stretched my arm straight up into the air, holding onto
an invisible pole.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine my surprise when a passenger behind me firmly clutched
my hand and held it in his until we safely arrived at 34th Street.
As I was making my exit I thanked him. He said it was his pleasure.
We parted. It was so crowded I never did see his face.

   Wendy Presslaff was walking along Lexington Avenue on a Sunday
afternoon when she came to a trendy dog-and-cat boutique. An
elegant woman was looking at the posted store hours. Her terrier
alternated between looking at her and at the door, but seemed to be
firmly planted at the shop. As Ms. Presslaff passed, she heard the
woman explain the situation to her dog. ``I'm sorry, Henry,'' she
said. ``There's nothing I can do about it. They're closed.''

   During the recent hot weather, Joe Hecht, unwilling to button
his shirt until absolutely necessary, took to walking to his office
on 45th Street with his tie untied, just draped loosely around his
collar.
</P>
<P>
   One morning, arriving at his office, he realized that the Perry
Ellis blue-striped tie he had had on that day had fallen off while
he was walking. He reluctantly left his cool building to retrace
his steps. There, at the corner of 43rd Street and Ninth Avenue,
was the missing tie. A good Samaritan had not only hung it on a

When Gabrielson told her what they were, she replied, ``You don't
clean place mats _ you wash them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Gabrielson said. ``They need to be dry-cleaned. They're
wool. They come from Wales.''

didn't know you could get wool from whales,'' she said.

   ``Cars came to a halt as the single-file line of ducks waddled
across,'' she reported. ``These were ducks with attitude _ they had
the right of way. No one in the cars seemed upset as they waited.
No one honked. There were even smiles. As the last duck crossed, it
flapped its large wings as if saying to the others in front,
``Let's move along, we've held up traffic long enough.''

drawers,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The bus zoomed down Broadway and when it arrived at 43rd Street,
the driver came back and lowered the chest to the street on the
mechanism used for wheelchairs. According to the conversation that
ensued, the woman had apparently told the driver she couldn't
afford to transport the chest any other way and he took pity on
her. But as he lowered the chest, his good-Samaritan instinct was
strained. ``Never again,'' he said.

<P>
   The last thing Ms. Tenace saw as the bus drove off was the woman
standing on the street with her chest, apparently waiting for a

JARRETT FINISHES FOURTH, PADS LEAD (For use by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATKINS GLEN, N.Y. _ Dale Jarrett checked another race off the
1999 NASCAR Winston Cup schedule Sunday, and added 26 points to his
championship lead.
</P>
<P>
   A guy could get used to that formula, all the way to his first
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett added to his points lead for the ninth consecutive race,
when he finished a career-best fourth in the Frontier at The Glen.
Jarrett, who began the season's 21st race at Watkins Glen
International with a 274-point lead over Mark Martin, extended his
advantage to a season-high 300 points heading into the Pepsi 400 at
Michigan Speedway on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   For those with short memories, Jarrett buried the field en route
to victory in the Kmart 400 at Michigan Speedway on June 13. He is
scheduled to enter the same No. 88 Quality Care Service/Ford Credit
Taurus he won with at Michigan and at the Indianapolis Motor
Speedway on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did what we had to do,'' said Jarrett, who tied his
career-best finish on a road course, originally set at Sears Point
Raceway in May 1997. Jarrett failed to earn five points for leading
a lap and never seriously challenged winner Jeff Gordon, runner-up
Ron Fellows or third-place Rusty Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some work to do on the road courses,'' Jarrett said.
``We'll just move along. We got what we could, and we'll be
extremely happy with that.'' STEWART SCRAMBLES TO SIXTH
</P>
<P>
   Rookie points leader Tony Stewart's first race at The Glen
featured a botched pit stop and another miscue by the driver. But
Stewart rallied for a sixth-place finish, his 13th top-10 result of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's first pit stop led to a stop-and-go penalty after he
exited with his gas refueling can connected to the car's nozzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a major setback, having to go from sixth to the tail of
the field because of a fuel can getting stuck,'' said Stewart,
driver of the No. 20 Home Depot Pontiac Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart later overcooked his entry into the inner loop turns,
forcing him into a complete stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably gave up 14 or 15 spots right there,'' Stewart said.
``We're making gains on our pit stops. We've still got room to
improve yet, and I've got room to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time we finish in the top 10 it feels good. But we made it
all too tough on ourselves to do that. We should have had a lot
easier day, and then maybe we could have concentrated more on
running in the top five.'' EARNHARDT HITS 600
</P>
<P>
   Seven-time Cup champion Dale Earnhardt hit 600 consecutive
career starts Sunday, and at least two other cars.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt and Richard Childress Racing teammate Mike Skinner
spun after making contact in Turn 1 of the 11-turn layout to
effectively drop both out of contention on Lap 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got into the back of Skinner,'' said Earnhardt, driver of
the No. 3 GM Goodwrench Service Plus Chevrolet Monte Carlo. ``That
ain't too hard to do here.''
</P>
<P>
   On the final lap, Earnhardt tangled with Darrell Waltrip and
smashed into the huge styrofoam blocks lining the Armco barrier.
Earnhardt managed to finish in 20th place.
</P>
<P>
   ``That 600th start was pretty sorry,'' said Earnhardt, who
joined Terry Labonte as only the second driver to make 600
consecutive Cup starts. ``It isn't one I want to remember.'' LAST

ERNESTO MELO ANTUNES, 66, WHO LED PORTUGUESE COUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Ernesto Melo Antunes, a Portuguese army officer who was
an architect and ideologist of the almost bloodless coup that
overthrew his country's longtime conservative dictatorship in 1974
and led to the return of democracy, died on Tuesday at his home in
Sintra, outside Lisbon. He was 66.
</P>
<P>
   He had cancer, the Portuguese national news agency Lusa
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Melo Antunes, who was a major at the time of the coup, was a
socialist and the chief architect of the political goals of the
Armed Forces Movement, which gave rise to the coup that ended four
decades of dictatorial rule in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   The military coup was unusual in that its goal was to have
Portugal become a democracy _ and that is what happened, after the
ouster of the country's unpopular last dictator, Marcello Caetano.
</P>
<P>
   The dictatorship was begun in 1932 under Antonio de Oliveira
Salazar and maintained by Caetano, beginning in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   As the Spanish national radio put it after the death of Melo
Antunes, ``He was one of the military officers who led the
so-called Armed Forces Movement, the core of the revolution of the
carnations,'' as the coup is sometimes called because joyful
soldiers slipped red carnations into the barrels of their rifles.
</P>
<P>
   And Mario Soares, a socialist who served two terms as president
in the post-coup era, said that he had ``had enormous influence in
the Revolution, despite being a discreet figure of scarce words.''
</P>
<P>
   Melo Antunes became a member of the Council of the Revolution,
which was established to supervise the restoration of democracy and
ceased operations in 1982. He became deputy prime minister for a
time when a new government, heavily dominated by the armed forces,
was formed in July 1974, after a post-coup, almost entirely
civilian government had fallen apart less than two months after
taking office.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to be foreign minister in 1975 and 1976, and from
1982 to 1989 he headed the U.N. Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975 he became the first representative of the new government
of Prime Minister Jose Batista Pinheiro Azevedo to visit Washington
since it took power in Lisbon a month earlier after removing
left-leaning leaders.
</P>
<P>
   After he met with President Ford and Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger, the White House announced an $85 million package of
emergency economic aid for Portugal, and Melo Antunes said that he
was ``grateful for the support and sympathy President Ford has
shown for the efforts that the present team in Portugal is doing to
establish true democracy in Portugal.''
</P>
<P>
   By late 1975, he was not only foreign minister but also the
leader of the left in the military, because the extreme leftists
had been purged. He told reporters at that time that the main
danger to the revolution came from members of the former privileged
class trying to win the support of certain elements in the
military.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, he said, all the Portuguese people seemed to
agree with the socialist program of the Armed Forces Movement.
``But when the program began to be carried out, the more privileged
classes began to react against the loss of privileges and organize
themselves against the revolution,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   While he was foreign minister, he made it clear that he believed
the military should retain a central role in politics ``to
guarantee the revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   He also was the chief of a commission that supervised the end of
Portugal's colonial rule in Angola, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique and
the Cape Verde Islands.

GORDON EXTENDS ROAD-COURSE STREAK WITH WIN AT THE GLEN

<P>
   WATKINS GLEN, N.Y. _ Jeff Gordon may not rule all he surveys in
NASCAR-land these days. His designs on a third consecutive Winston
Cup championship remain barely mathematically alive.
</P>
<P>
   But on NASCAR's two road courses, Gordon still rocks. He has
since the summer of 1997, when Gordon began a streak of consecutive
road-course victories that reached a NASCAR Winston Cup record five
after Sunday's Frontier at The Glen.
</P>
<P>
   His record run of three consecutive road-course poles snapped by
Rusty Wallace on Friday, Gordon regeared and retained his magic
line around Watkins Glen International's repaved and repaired
2.45-mile, 11-turn layout. Gordon led a race-high 55 of 90 laps
while repelling the challenges of Wallace and road-racing hired gun
Ron Fellows to notch his series-leading fifth victory of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, the reigning and three-time Cup champion, scored the
first road-course victory of his career here in August 1997. Since
then he has swept the two events run at Sears Point Raceway in
Sonoma, Calif., and two at WGI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain it. It blows me away,'' said Gordon, who
finished 0.736 seconds ahead of Canadian native Fellows. ``What
we've done on road courses lately has shocked me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not hard for me to go back three or four years ago and
think about a good (road) race for me was just if I stayed on the
racetrack and didn't miss a shift. Or, I should say, I didn't miss
five shifts. Now it's just trying to get the most out of the car
and be smooth and not be too aggressive. I was pretty proud. I
didn't miss a shift all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon knew that whatever chance Fellows had of winning his
first Cup race boiled down to a restart after the day's seventh
caution flag flew on laps 87-88.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some areas, Ron was better than I was,'' said Gordon, driver
of the No. 24 DuPont Automotive Finishes Chevrolet Monte Carlo. ``I
knew if he got close to me in the carousel turn, he could make a
pass. If he made a pass on me, it was going to be very tough to get
back by him. It was very important to not only get a good restart,
but drive hard into Turn 1 and get through the first couple of
corners and get some distance between us.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellows said Gordon _ buried in fifth in the points chase _
coyly initiated that process moments before the restart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to take a run at him at the green,'' said Fellows,
driver of the No. 87 Bully Hill Vineyards Chevy. ``He saw me, he
jumped on the brakes, I jumped on the brakes _ and he took off.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellows, driving a car owned by Cup regular Joe Nemechek,
nevertheless closed a super season that saw him win the NASCAR
Craftsman Truck event here June 26 and finish second in the
companion Busch Grand National race the next afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second place to Jeff Gordon is not that bad,'' said Fellows,
who is developing the Chevrolet Corvette C-5 that will be raced in
the 24 Hours of LeMans in June. ``I'm sure I'll be happier
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, the record-setting polesitter, settled for third. It
was his 11th top-10 result of 1999. Wallace also earned his third
consecutive top-four finish at WGI and his ninth top-10 in 14 races
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gordon just really had a great car today,'' said Wallace,
driver of the No. 2 Miller Lite Ford Taurus. ``He's really got
something figured out on road courses.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup points-leader Dale Jarrett placed fourth, a
career-best at WGI. Jarrett, driver of the No. 88 Quality Care
Service/Ford Credit Taurus, extended his lead over Mark Martin by
26 points to 300. It is the largest spread of a season that on the
road courses, at least, has seen Gordon rock. nn

WILLIAMS CAPTURES ACURA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ Serena Williams intends to be the
world's No. 1 tennis player.
</P>
<P>
   Williams beat Julie Halard-Decugis 6-1, 6-4 in 1 hour, 21
minutes Sunday to win the Acura Classic at Manhattan Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Although Williams is ninth in today's WTA rankings, the highest
of her career, a jump to No. 1 doesn't look feasible this year. But
Williams insists she is on the way up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't joking at all,'' Williams said. ``I'm trying to be
the best I can be. I'm serious. I definitely feel it's in reach.''
</P>
<P>
   After a two-month layoff and a win on Sunday, Williams might
feel anything is within reach. Halard-Decugis broke Williams' serve
just once, in the second set, to tie it 4-4. Williams responded by
breaking Halard-Decugis' serve the next game, even though
Halard-Decugis started the game with a 40-0 lead. Halard-Decugis
double-faulted and made three consecutive unforced errors off her
forehand.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's playing like she's No. 1,'' Halard-Decugis said. ``She
beat No. 1 last night, played Martina Hingis and other top players.
And she's playing like No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   One obstacle that could prevent the 17-year-old from reaching
the top spot _ aside from Hingis, Lindsay Davenport and her older
sister Venus _ is her schedule. The Acura Classic was only her
ninth tournament this year. Next year she plans to play in 17
tournaments but will also devote a chunk of time to college at the
Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Halard-Decugis, both power players, each made 24
unforced errors. But Williams had 25 winners to Halard-Decugis' 12.
Williams also served better, leading 7-0 in aces.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure against Serena, you have to serve very, very well,''
Halard-Decugis said. ``For sure, she makes a lot of pressure on
your serve. She makes me tense.''
</P>
<P>
   Halard-Decugis hadn't lost a set in the tournament until she
faced Williams. She beat Davenport 6-3, 7-5 in the semifinals and
said Williams played better than No. 2 Davenport, who was off her
game.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was the tournament's sixth seed and hadn't played
singles since the French Open in June. She lost one set this week,
in her first-round match against Russian Elena Likhovtseva. Then
she advanced fairly easily past Patty Schnyder, Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario and No. 1 Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   The finals were almost anti-climactic because both Williams and
Halard-Decugis played better in their victories against Hingis and
Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   Did Williams expect to win the tournament?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised,'' she said. ``I'm never surprised. I've
been working at this since I was 4. I think I should have more
tournaments under my belt by now.''
</P>
<P>
   Another tournament she is aiming for takes place later this
month, the U.S. Open. Again, Williams is confident about her
chances there and boasted she could win.
</P>
<P>
   Halard-Decugis didn't make such a statement but said she hopes
to build off her L.A. performance and fare well in New York.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Williams was loquacious about many topics, except for
playing tournaments when Venus does not and her beginnings in
Compton.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters plan to face each other as little as possible.
Williams said she gets tired of explaining that plan and will not
talk about it. She also gets tired of discussing her birthplace.
Her hometown is now announced as Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   As Steffi Graf announced her retirement earlier this week,
Williams became the first player to win in this post-Graf women's
tennis era. Williams and other players answered questions about
Graf throughout the week. On Sunday, Williams didn't sound
concerned about trying to match Graf's longevity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see myself in an interview room in 15 years,''
Williams said. ``I love tennis, love to compete, but there is so
much more I can do.''

RANGERS CATCHER DREAMS OF MVP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Texas Rangers catcher Ivan Rodriguez, after becoming
the first catcher in major-league history to hit 20 home runs and
steal 20 bases in the same season, dreams of an even greater honor
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The American League's Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look for the MVP, some guys have some great numbers,''
Rodriguez said. ``But if I keep playing hard and do what I'm doing,
it's possible. That's one of my dreams, to win the award.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said his chances of winning will be much better if he
finishes the season with 100 runs scored and 100 runs batted in. He
would be the first catcher to do so since Kansas City's Darrell
Porter in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to have that,'' Rodriguez said. ``I think my
only chance to get MVP is if I make those numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez helped his cause Sunday by going 3-for-6 with a
double, two home runs, three runs scored and three RBI. He now has
81 runs scored and 82 RBI. CATCHER STEALS
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez is the 13th catcher in major-league history to
steal at least 20 bases in a season. The list: Player, team/Year/SB
John Wathan, Royals/1982/36 Ray Schalk, White Sox/1916/30 John
Wathan, Royals/1983/28 Jason Kendall, Pirates/1998/26 John Stearns,
Mets/1978/25 Ray Schalk, White Sox/1914/24 Johnny Kling,
Cubs/1902/23 Johnny Kling, Cubs/1903/23 Jason Kendall,
Pirates/1999/22 Benito Santiago, Padres/1987/21 Craig Biggio,
Astros/1989/21 Red Dooin, Phillies/1908/20 Ivan Rodriguez,
Rangers/1999/20
TOUGH STRETCH
</P>
<P>
   With the Oakland Athletics charging, the Rangers enter one of
the most difficult stretches of their schedule. Their next 13 games
consist of four games at the Cleveland Indians, a six-game
homestand against the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees and
three games in Toronto against the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are 10-16 against those four teams this year.
However, the Rangers are one of the few teams that have had some
success at Jacobs Field. They're 13-12 at the Indians' home park
since it opened in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough stretch, but I think we can handle it,'' first
baseman Rafael Palmeiro said.
GREER HOBBLED BUT HOT
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Greer is bothered by his strained left ankle but continues
to play, and it hasn't affected his hitting. Greer went 9-for-18
during the White Sox series with four home runs and seven RBI. He
hit two home runs Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this series I felt comfortable at the plate,''
Greer said. ``But for the last few weeks, I've been getting on base
and I'm continuing with the same feeling. Fortunately, some balls
fell in.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, fell in the bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hit enough home runs to know the difference,'' Greer
said. ``I'm up there swinging the bat and hoping it falls in the
hole. If it falls over the fence, that's even better.'' BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Rafael Palmeiro walked twice Sunday but has only one hit in
his past 19 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   _ Todd Zeile tied a career high with four hits Sunday, the
eighth time he has done it, including three this season.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rangers starters are 25-12 with a 4.42 earned-run average over
their past 54 games. nn

WELFARE CARDS GIVE BANKS SOME CONTROL OF POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Changes graf that begins ``For months Citigroup boasted...''
Inserts new graf to follow this graf.)  (lb) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A few months ago, seemingly with good intentions, the
state of New York gave a new electronic banking card to Margarita
O., an 18-year-old from Mexico and the mother of a baby boy. It is
an unusual debit card. On the front is a picture of her smiling
shyly. The familiar black magnetic stripe on the back gives her
access not to a checking account but to $448 a month in government
food credits and cash.
</P>
<P>
   The card held much promise. She would have the same access
everyone else had to all those automatic teller machines. No more
waiting in lines at check-cashing stores. No more demeaning food
stamps. And just a short walk from her rented room in East Harlem
waited Banco Popular, a cheery neighborhood bank with two gleaming
ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, her card is useless at Banco Popular. In fact, it
has not been accepted at most ATMs in East Harlem and throughout
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Out of frustration, Margarita O., who asked that her last name
not be used, because she is an illegal immigrant, simply walks up
the street to the same check-cashing store where she used to get
her benefits free.
</P>
<P>
   Only now she pays up to $2.35 for each withdrawal _ $1.50 to the
store and 85 cents to Citigroup, the financial conglomerate hired
by the state to distribute welfare benefits through ATM cards. That
money, she has come to realize, is being deducted from the welfare
benefits of her son, who was born in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand,'' she said, ``why they are taking away
money from my child.''
</P>
<P>
   She is enduring the unintended consequences of a sweeping
transformation in the way the nation's poorest citizens receive
cash and food credits from the government. In the last few years,
39 states and the District of Columbia have hired corporations to
distribute welfare benefits through the nation's vast web of ATMs
and grocery-store debit machines.
</P>
<P>
   The states hoped to reduce fraud, save money and draw poor
people into the financial mainstream. They wanted to encourage
better money habits and to provide convenience and simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   But the emerging system has pitted profits against service in a
way that has created new vulnerabilities for millions of welfare
recipients across the country.
</P>
<P>
   They are assessed ATM fees that regular customers do not have to
pay _ fees that are deducted from their welfare benefits. The
number of free withdrawals is severely limited, sometimes to two a
month. Balance inquiries at ATMs are forbidden in many states,
including New York. By the thousands, welfare recipients have
learned at the cash register that their cards often do not work
across state lines.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding over most of this system is Citigroup, the parent of
Citibank and the nation's largest financial-services company. About
12 million Americans in 29 states, including New York, now get
welfare with Citigroup ATM cards. At the end of 1998, Citigroup was
distributing $640 million in welfare benefits each month.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup's dominance is growing. As welfare rolls shrink,
competitors have backed off because there is far less money to be
made. This has strengthened Citigroup's position as it pursues new
contracts and, once it wins contracts, in deciding how welfare
money is delivered.
</P>
<P>
   New York vividly illustrates how the states, by handing off the
cumbersome and politically sensitive task of providing aid to the
poor, have given broad new control over welfare policy to private
corporations, primarily Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   For months, as Citigroup has struggled for profits in the
welfare business, the company did not provide hundreds of thousands
of New York City welfare recipients with access to 23,000 ATMs in
the NYCE network and 40,000 ATMs in the MAC network, the two
largest in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, which will be paid about $80 million by the state
over the next four years to distribute benefits, blocked access by
refusing to pay the full fee charged by other banks for each
transaction. Payment of the full fee would have allowed poor people
to use the same range of ATMs as Citigroup's regular customers.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews over several weeks, Citigroup officials defended
their decision, saying New York City's poor had adequate access to
cash. State welfare officials, while expressing disappointment,
said their contract with the bank gave them little power to tell
Citigroup what to do. ``I really don't have any authority at all to
direct them one way or another,'' said Brian Wing, the state's
commissioner of temporary and disability assistance.
</P>
<P>
   And yet this situation is just as Wing and other welfare
officials planned it. Despite warnings from one state justice who
reviewed the contract, state officials willingly embraced an
ambiguous contract that gave Citigroup a free hand to decide how
New York's poor get access to their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, Citigroup's control was again on display.
After being informed that this article was imminent, Citigroup
officials abruptly announced that starting next month they would
allow access to the NYCE network, though not the MAC network.
</P>
<P>
   They also said they would install 25 ATMs in poor neighborhoods
and embark on an educational program. The measures will cost
Citigroup nearly $2 million this year, the officials said. ``We
succeed when the program succeeds,'' said Brian Claire, senior
director for welfare ATM cards at Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   Claire said Citigroup delivers welfare at a saving to taxpayers,
and with greater convenience. ``We have a great track record,'' he
said. Likewise, he dismissed concerns that Citigroup exerts undue
control over the welfare system, saying, ``The states will dictate
what services they require.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the changes announced Friday, the bank's welfare
customers will still have access to fewer ATMs than regular
customers and they will continue to pay special fees.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And around the country, Citigroup faces mounting criticism.
Benjamin Cayetano, the governor of Hawaii, recently complained in a
letter to Citigroup that its policies have resulted in higher costs
for his state's welfare population.
</P>
<P>
   In Pennsylvania, a food merchants' association blamed Citigroup
for costly system crashes, and one state senator, citing mass
confusion and reduced access to benefits in poor neighborhoods,
demanded a return to paper food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   While Citigroup is subject to a variety of reporting
requirements and oversight, an association of state auditors has
called for more rigorous reviews of Citigroup and other
corporations entrusted with billions of welfare dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more assurance that the companies handling these
transactions are handling them properly,'' said Kathryn
Schwerdtfeger, special assistant to the Texas state auditor.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials, including some who helped create the
system, have become increasingly uneasy with Citigroup's influence
over the nation's welfare system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really concerned about this,'' said Shirley Watkins, who
oversees the nation's food-stamp program as the Department of
Agriculture's undersecretary for food and nutrition. ``If there's a
monopoly on a program like this, it puts us in real jeopardy. There
is no competition. And where there is no competition, people charge
you what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup's growth has implications beyond welfare. The Treasury
Department is pushing hard to use electronic banking for all
federal government payments: Social Security checks, veterans'
checks, tax refunds. While Citigroup has yet to make money
distributing welfare, it is now positioned to become the conduit
for hundreds of billions of dollars in other government payments.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to questions about Citigroup, there are other
difficulties with the new welfare ATM cards. Federal welfare
officials once projected $250 million a year in administrative
savings. No longer. Officials once projected billions in savings
from reduced fraud. No such savings have been shown.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials once predicted that welfare recipients would
get unlimited access to the country's ATMs ``at little or no
cost.'' Instead, for the first time, the nation's poor are paying
millions of dollars in ATM fees and surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   The Promise
</P>
<P>
   Paperless Payments for Greater Efficiency
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind welfare ATM cards was to ``ride the rails'' of
electronic banking and end all the sorting and mailing that go with
distributing mountains of food stamps and welfare checks.
</P>
<P>
   For taxpayers and budget cutters, there was the prospect of
efficiency and cost saving. The new system, championed by Vice
President Al Gore beginning in the early 1990s, was given a clunky
bureaucratic name _ electronic benefits transfer, or EBT. The banks
cast it as a way to help the needy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important benefit,'' Citigroup officials told
regulators, ``is that EBT allows low-income individuals a point of
entry into the mainstream of electronic banking.''
</P>
<P>
   There was money to be made, too. With federal and state
governments paying out about $100 billion a year in public
assistance, companies would earn sizable fees for handling the
transactions, and generate new ATM surcharges and new customers.
</P>
<P>
   While other banks showed interest in welfare ATM cards,
including First Union, Nationsbank and Chase Manhattan, Fleet, none
went after the business more aggressively than Citigroup. Still,
Citigroup's selection by New York in 1996 was controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup was the low bidder, but evaluators ranked the company
third for its ability to handle the technical demands of the job.
Getting food and money to poor people is a complex undertaking. It
requires sophisticated software capable of tracking hundreds of
thousands of people. A telephone line offering help must be
staffed, debit cards issued, recipients trained, equipment
installed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, after challenges from Citigroup competitors, a state
judge threw out the New York contract, noting that Citigroup had
been rated inadequate in ``two of the most important technical
criteria'' _ ensuring enough access to cash and recruiting retail
stores to participate.
</P>
<P>
   But appellate courts overturned the ruling on technical grounds,
and this year the first welfare ATM cards were mailed, first to
Staten Island and then to Manhattan and the Bronx. By November, the
cards will be in Brooklyn and Queens, and the rest of the state
will get them soon after.
</P>
<P>
   Under its contract, Citigroup must demonstrate in each ZIP code
that access to cash under the new ATM system is at least as good as
it was under the old system, in which welfare recipients could go
to any one of hundreds of check-cashing stores, show identification
and get their food stamps and cash. They paid nothing.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Citigroup boasted that it had improved access
dramatically in New York City. According to Citigroup reports,
welfare households in Manhattan have access to 867 free ``ATM cash
access points'' _ a seemingly dramatic improvement over the old
network of 102 free check-cashing stores.
</P>
<P>
   But those 867 access points are in 221 locations. In the 10012
ZIP code in Greenwich Village, for example, Citigroup lists 13 ATM
access points. Twelve of them are in one spot, a Citibank in
Washington Square.
</P>
<P>
   When neighborhood wealth is taken into account, Citigroup
records show that ATM access increased for poor people who live in
wealthy areas, but decreased in the poorest neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In the three Manhattan ZIP codes with the highest median family
incomes, a total of 461 welfare households may choose from 43 free
ATM locations.
</P>
<P>
   In the three ZIP codes with the lowest incomes, all in Harlem,
14,027 welfare households have access to six free ATM locations.
Under the old system, those families could pick from 15
check-cashing stores where they could get their benefits free.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, though, when Citigroup makes the NYCE network
available to New York City welfare recipients, access to ATMs will
more than triple.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Reality
</P>
<P>
   Malfunctioning Cards and Scarce Machines
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning in the Bronx, hundreds of welfare
recipients, mostly women and children, crowded into a stifling city
welfare center near Crotona Park. Most were there because of their
new welfare ATM cards.
</P>
<P>
   Hermenegil Nunez, a mother of three, said she had spent five
maddening days trying to use her card. The welfare workers said the
numbers on the card were wrong, she said. Twice she was sent to
Manhattan to get replacement cards. Those did not work either. Now
her eyes are filled with anxiety. ``I don't have anything,'' she
said. ``My sister, thank God she made me a little shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   In the lobby, a welfare worker stood by a model of an ATM,
telling a small crowd how the cards work. Paul Hayes, a welfare
recipient, interrupted. ``I've tried four places and it kept saying
the same thing: `Try again, try again,''' he said. The welfare
worker said the magnetic strip on Hayes' card appeared to have been
damaged. A common problem, the worker explained. ``But I only used
it for the first time yesterday,'' Hayes protested.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest complaint at the center is that no one knows which
stores or banks will take them. No one knows what the fees are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Convenient my foot!'' Gail Saunders, another welfare
recipient, said bitterly.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Citigroup has avoided doing for New York welfare
recipients what it has done all along for 117,000 welfare
recipients in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Vermont:
provide access to NYCE, the dominant ATM network in New York state
and a ready-made vehicle for distributing money for the poor. In
New York City alone, there are 3,200 ATMs connected to the NYCE
network.
</P>
<P>
   It boiled down to a dispute over 13 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is an arcane ATM transaction charge that banks pay
to one another. Under NYCE rules, a bank must pay 38 cents when one
of its customers withdraws money from another bank's ATM. Until
Friday, Citigroup said it would pay only 25 cents for withdrawals
by New York welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   That kept Margarita O. from using her neighborhood Banco
Popular, which is part of NYCE.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup's policy prompted its banking rivals to charge that
the company is using its control over the flow of welfare money to
steer customers away from their ATMs. They have also accused
Citigroup of trying to increase its profits at their expense.
Citigroup saved an estimated $130,000 a month by prohibiting access
to NYCE.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citicorp Services Inc. is sacrificing EBT recipient access in
exchange for increasing the profitability of its contract with the
state of New York,'' Denis O'Leary, executive vice president of
Chase Manhattan Bank, wrote in June to state welfare officials.
</P>
<P>
   Before changing their policy on Friday, Citigroup officials
portrayed their competitors' unwillingness to accept the lower fee
as a failure to fulfill their obligation to help the needy. On
Friday, Citigroup officials said they relented to further enhance
service to welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The poor in New York have been stymied by another important link
in Citigroup's system of delivering welfare. To augment their ATM
network, Citigroup officials said they have arranged for hundreds
of grocery stores to allow cash withdrawals by welfare recipients _
just like regular bank customers.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup lists nearly 400 ``cash back'' stores in Manhattan
alone. But on a recent evening in East Harlem, managers in a dozen
small grocery stores on the list all said the same thing: Yes, they
accept welfare ATM cards as payment for food. No, they do not allow
cash withdrawals. They explained that they start the business day
with $100 and would be drained of cash if they allowed withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Immigration Coalition, an advocacy group, surveyed
84 stores in Harlem _ all on the Citigroup lists. Forty-four said
they did not allow cash withdrawals. Of the rest, most charged a
fee or imposed other limits. (Late last week, Citigroup officials
commissioned their own survey of 44 grocery stores in Manhattan and
the Bronx _ with opposite results. Every single store, they said,
agreed to allow cash withdrawals.)
</P>
<P>
   In the confusion, welfare recipients have been returning to
check-cashing stores, which now charge fees for withdrawals using
ATM cards. Citigroup benefits when welfare recipients use its cards
at check-cashing stores, because it does not pay to check-cashing
stores or groceries the fees it must pay to other banks.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Citigroup's system has shifted some costs to
welfare recipients themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, nearly two-thirds of all welfare ATM withdrawals in
the city were made not at free ATMs but at small grocery stores or
check-cashing stores or machines that charged recipients a fee,
state records show. Those fees totaled $275,709.
</P>
<P>
   Wing, the state's top welfare official, acknowledged that
welfare ATM cards shift some costs of welfare to the recipients
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a voluntary shift,'' he said, because welfare
recipients can avoid all fees by finding a free, participating ATM
and limiting withdrawals to four a month. (For each additional
withdrawal, Citigroup charges recipients 85 cents.)
</P>
<P>
   Finding the right ATM can be tough for those unable to log onto
the state Web site that lists the free ATMs. As a test, Liz
Krueger, associate director of the Community Food Resource Center
in Manhattan, said she recently called the Citigroup telephone help
line to find the nearest free ATM. No such information available,
she said the operator told her. Ms. Krueger tried nine more times
over several days. The response never varied.
</P>
<P>
   The help line itself is one barometer of the confusion. In July,
the help line logged 680,342 telephone calls _ many from people
trying to find out how much they had left to spend. (With the
approval of state officials, Citigroup officials decided to
prohibit balance inquiries at ATMs by welfare recipients because of
the expense.)
</P>
<P>
   The phones of local politicians have been ringing, too. Virginia
Fields, the Manhattan borough president, and Fernando Ferrer, the
Bronx borough president, have appealed for better access and
education.
</P>
<P>
   Wing, asked a few weeks ago for his overall assessment of how
the welfare ATM cards are working in New York City, replied, ``It's
going exceedingly well.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Future
</P>
<P>
   Profit Outlook Dims as Welfare Rolls Shrink
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the shortcomings of welfare ATM cards, few people want
to go back to paper. The future is electronic, government officials
say. They acknowledge the confusion, but blame much of it on the
inevitable pain of transforming a complicated system. As problems
are ironed out, they contend, poor people will come to appreciate
the cards. Surveys in some states have shown just that.
</P>
<P>
   Some shortcomings persist. Under federal law, regular ATM
customers are liable for a maximum of only $50 in losses if their
cards are stolen. Those protections do not apply to welfare
recipients. Meanwhile, many of the heady predictions of the early
1990s have not come true. Hopes are fading that the electronic
system will reduce administrative costs by much, if at all. One
early estimate projected $1 billion in savings over five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will probably be cost-neutral,'' acknowledged Ms. Watkins,
the Agriculture Department undersecretary.
</P>
<P>
   As for cutting welfare fraud, one federal study concluded, ``EBT
alone has not effectively deterred fraud in the delivery of
food-stamp benefits.'' Welfare ATM cards have no effect on the
largest source of fraud _ payments to people who misrepresent their
financial circumstances. Billions are lost this way.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, from 1991 to 1997, welfare ATM records enabled the
Agriculture Department to prosecute 234 fraud cases involving a
grand total of $27 million.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic system has fallen short for another constituency
_ Citigroup and the other companies that jumped into the business.
The problem lies in two numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, 28 million Americans were on food stamps. Today,
the number is 18 million. The trouble is that it is a volume
business. So in New York, where Citigroup is paid $1.47 a month for
every household on cash assistance, its revenue diminishes with
each family that leaves welfare. A few years ago, Citigroup
expected to generate $145 million in revenues over the life of the
contract in New York. Now that hundreds of thousands of people have
left New York's welfare rolls, revenue might not exceed $80
million.
</P>
<P>
   Claire declined to reveal Citigroup's earnings from welfare ATM
cards. He said the company had built only a ``very modest profit''
into its bid proposals. ``To date, our EBT business has yet to
realize an operating profit,'' he said. E-Citi, the Citigroup unit
responsible for welfare benefit transfers and other
electronic-banking projects, lost $142 million in 1998 and another
$80 million in the first half of 1999, company reports show.
</P>
<P>
   Deluxe Government Services, a Milwaukee-based company that holds
welfare ATM contracts in eight states, set aside $36.4 million last
year to cover anticipated losses. A third company, Transactive
Corp. of Texas, is pulling out of the business. ``Not profitable,''
a spokesman explained tersely.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, armed with patience and deep pockets, seems intent on
expanding its electronic-welfare business. Last year it agreed to
buy Transactive for $11.5 million, a move that caught the interest
of the Justice Department's antitrust lawyers. The department
measures market dominance with something called the
Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. A score of 1,800 means that the market
is ``highly concentrated.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice lawyers scored Citigroup at 4,225. (Late Friday, a
Citigroup spokesman produced an expert on antitrust law to
challenge the relevance of this score.)
</P>
<P>
   Warning that Citigroup would raise prices and cut services if it
were allowed to buy its ``only substantial competitor,'' the
Justice Department filed a lawsuit to stop the takeover. Though
Citigroup backed off, and the lawsuit was withdrawn, it was not
much of a victory for the department. Transactive is still pulling
out, and Citigroup is negotiating new contracts with several
states.
</P>
<P>
   As state after state switches to electronic welfare, the poor
increasingly find themselves voiceless. Many of the rules governing
the welfare ATM cards are set by an obscure organization called the
EBT Council. An arm of the National Automated Clearing House
Association, a financial trade group in Virginia, the council
includes 57 representatives of major banks, ATM networks, grocery
chains and states.
</P>
<P>
   It does not have a single member from a welfare advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not blocking them from joining _ if they pay the
membership fee,'' a spokeswoman for the EBT Council said.
</P>
<P>
   The fee is $6,000 a year. Plus a $3,000 initiation charge.

RICHARD UP FOR THE TASK?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ USC cornerback Kris Richard is wearing Brian
Kelly's number and replacing Daylon McCutcheon. Other than that,
there isn't much pressure on the sophomore who hasn't started a
college football game.
</P>
<P>
   If one player has a question mark heading into the season, it's
Richard, who has the task of following McCutcheon, a mainstay for
USC's defense the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's added pressure. A lot of people have big expectations on
me replacing a guy who was All-Pac-10,'' Richard said. ``I think
I'm the man for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe early on teams will come at me. I believe it's going
to be a learning season. It's not going to be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard also hasn't shied away from wearing No. 42, which was
worn by Kelly, not to mention Ronnie Lott.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do want to wear it. I want to wear it because it's a
personal challenge,'' Richard said. ``I don't see it as a burden.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Richard's inexperience, some believe true freshman Darrell
Rideaux of Long Beach Poly will eventually start at his cornerback
spot. Rideaux is projected as a nickel back as training camp opens
and isn't ready to ponder starting just two days into camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be in a position to complement (the secondary),''
Rideaux said. ``I look at myself as a student. My role has not been
determined. I'm not there yet. I believe I'm on my way.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Poll position: USC coach Paul Hackett didn't agree with the
first Associated Press poll, which had USC ranked 19th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a little overzealous at this point,'' Hackett
said. ``A little ambitious. Could we be that high (later in the
season)? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   One player who disagreed with Hackett was quarterback Carson
Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're a little underrated,'' Palmer said. ``And
hopefully we'll surprise some people.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Ochs injured: Fullback Brennan Ochs, projected to be a
starter, sprained his ankle and will be out at least two days. Chad
Pierson moves into the No. 1 spot, but there is a chance Jabari
Jackson and Frank Strong could also play fullback.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest questions when we start (practicing in
pads) is where are we at the fullback position?'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Simmons slowed: Starting cornerback Antuan Simmons had cramps
for the second straight day and missed most of Sunday's two
practices.
</P>
<P>
   __ Watch that swing: USC free safety Ife Ohalete lost his cool
during a scuffle with tight end Pat Swanson. Ohalete took a punch
at Swanson and hit him in the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very fortunate he didn't break something,'' Hackett
said. ``Boys will be boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was young, I was a fired-up coach, and I'd jump in the
middle of those things,'' Hackett said. ``But I got hit in the head
once.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett planned to lecture the team about practice-field fights
Sunday night, to avoid any preseason injuries.
</P>
<P>
   __ Morning off: Freshmen Steve Stevenson, Kareem Kelly, Lucais
MacKay, Chris Prosser and Omar Nazel missed the morning practice
for academic-counseling sessions.
</P>
<P>
   __ By the numbers: For the second day in a row, a field crew
botched painting the field at UC Irvine. The 20-yard line said
``02'' and the 30 was ``03.'' The mistakes were eventually
corrected.

PEE WEE REESE MOURNED AS ONE OF BROOKLYN'S OWN
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the bar at VFW Post 1380 in Brooklyn, a
yellow-brick box a few blocks from Prospect Park, Bill Reilly and
Jack Farrell were arguing Sunday about an old neighbor who excelled
on the baseball field.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God, he was like a vacuum cleaner,'' said Farrell, 81, a
retired heating engineer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I disagree with you,'' said Reilly, 72, a retired cargo
weigher. ``He gave the team stability, but he wasn't a Marty
Marion,'' the St. Louis Cardinals' gracefully rangy shortstop.
``What he was was the essence of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighbor, of course, was Pee Wee Reese, who captained the
great Brooklyn Dodgers teams of the '40s and '50s from a spot
somewhere between second and third base, thereby anchoring not just
an infield or a team but a whole borough.
</P>
<P>
   Reese's death on Saturday at the age of 81 of lung cancer
afforded Brooklynites of a certain age yet another opportunity to
revisit the days when a ballplayer meant something to a town. Like
Joe DiMaggio, Reese was remembered for leading his team with class
and dignity, but unlike DiMaggio, Reese was a king who lived among
his subjects, in a little brick duplex in Bay Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in those days,'' Reilly said as he pointedly ignored the
Yankees-Twins game on TV behind him, ``the Dodgers were a community
team. You have to understand, nobody made any money, so you lived
in the neighborhood. You had Reese and Snider living in Bay Ridge,
hanging out in the same gin mill. You know what it's like now? It's
like going to the movies. Who cares!''
</P>
<P>
   Reese may be best remembered as the Dodger who did the most to
ease Jackie Robinson across the color barrier, and Reilly was
annoyed that Reese ``became known as a humanitarian, and it
overshadowed his baseball prowess.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Sunday, no one was remembering a diving backhand stab or a
clutch run batted in. They were remembering that Pee Wee was the
Dodgers, and the Dodgers were Brooklyn, and now Pee Wee, who long
ago moved on with the Dodgers to sunnier climes, was dead, and that
was it.
</P>
<P>
   Outside 9712 Barwell Terrace, the aforementioned little brick
duplex, James Millar was kicking himself all over again for having
given away Reese's autograph to a family who moved into Reese's
house, only to see them move later to Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I said today,'' said Millar, 58, a flagman for
New York City Transit, ``son of a gun, I gave that thing away. Does
anybody know where ballplayers live today?'' he asked. ``Nobody
does. They live on their three-quarter of an acre in what's the
name of that place over the GWB.'' He was referring to New Jersey
towns across from the George Washington Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Samara, who grew up on 97th Street, vividly recalled
seeing Carl Erskine, the pitcher, pick up Reese in his car on his
way to Ebbets Field. ``I'd say hello, but I liked to not bother
them too much,'' he said. ``I'd try to respect their privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   At the VFW, Farrell and Reilly seemed to be coming to an
agreement. ``We lost a guy who loved to play baseball, and perhaps
had more moral fiber to his character than any of those so-called
multimillionaires you have today,'' Farrell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pee Wee was Pee Wee,'' his friend replied. ``He was a good
guy, a decent human being. But the point is this: in all of your
life, have you ever heard a bad word about Pee Wee?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Farrell said solemnly. ``Never.''

QB PICTURE LOOKING FUZZY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Eight months after it began, UCLA's quarterback
quagmire remains exactly that. Coach Bob Toledo's April optimism _
that a starter would emerge to direct an offense loaded with
playmakers _ has dissolved into August reality.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks before the season opener, Toledo's talking platoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing two is a real possibility,'' he said. ``I don't like
playing two, but we might start that way and see how they respond.
I'm not ready to go with one guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior Drew Bennett is the front-runner based on experience and
would start if the season began today. But Toledo and offensive
coordinator/quarterbacks coach Al Borges will give Bennett's
competitors (sophomore Scott McEwan and freshmen Ryan McCann and
Cory Paus) plenty of opportunities this week.
</P>
<P>
   Borges has rigged the practice schedule to ensure that each
quarterback gets ample time with the No. 1 offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a checklist of plays that each guy will run several
times,'' Borges said. ``We want to evaluate each guy against
multiple scenarios.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes a scrimmage Saturday afternoon. Afterward, Toledo
and Borges will select two quarterbacks to compete for the starting
job. It's the only option, since they can't prepare four
quarterbacks for game conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all throwing the same amount of passes (this week),
and in the scrimmage situation we'll try to let them all go with
the first team,'' Toledo said. ``But I told them this isn't an
intramural team. Everybody doesn't get an equal chance. By Sunday,
I'd like to have two.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Helping hand: McEwan, a Thousand Oaks native, injected some
zing into his passes after several summer workouts with Clay
Richardson, a former college coach who tutors quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the season, coach Borges teaches us the philosophical
points and how to read defenses,'' McEwan said. ``But he isn't
allowed to coach us in the summer (because of NCAA rules) and I
needed someone to work on my throwing mechanics.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson advised McEwan to throw off his back foot and drop
his release point a few inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the hardest I've ever thrown,'' McEwan said.
</P>
<P>
   __ On losing Losman: Toledo on freshman quarterback J.P.
Losman's decision to transfer after participating in spring
practice:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed he left. He didn't give it a chance here. He
expected too much too soon. Fifteen days? So he'll go to Tulane and
redshirt and he'll be a long way (from home).''
</P>
<P>
   __ Zamano update: Former linebacker Anselmo Zamano's recovery
from a devastating knee injury is nothing less than amazing.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago at Michigan, Zamano tore every ligament in his
right knee and almost lost his lower leg because of a severed
artery. Now, after numerous surgeries and hundreds of hours of
rehabilitation, Zamano, a Fontana resident, can run full speed and
move laterally. But a return to football remains at least a year
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had arthroscopic surgery this summer to clean some things
up and it looks good in there,'' said Geoff Schaadt, UCLA's
director of athletic training. ``But he's not ready for this
season. He might have a chance next spring.''

THE BIG CITY: A MANY-TONGUED CITY HEARS A CRY FOR ENGLISH 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After leading the revolt against bilingual education
in California, Ron Unz would like to see one in New York City. Unz,
a software millionaire who successfully promoted the Proposition
227 initiative there last year, believes that New Yorkers are even
more determined than Californians to see their children educated in
English.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poll numbers in New York are stronger than just about any
other place I've looked,'' said Unz, the chairman of a group called
English for the Children. ``We're seriously exploring the
possibility of putting a measure like Proposition 227 on the ballot
in New York City.'' He is considering sponsoring a petition drive
to urge a referendum on an amendment to the City Charter.
</P>
<P>
   Unz tested the local sentiment for a version of Proposition 227
by commissioning a poll asking whether all public school classes
should be taught in English, with non-English-speaking students
placed in an intensive one-year English immersion program (instead
of the native-language classes now offered in bilingual education
programs). Of the 1,411 residents of New York State polled by Zogby
International, 79 percent said yes. Among New York City residents,
75 percent said yes.
</P>
<P>
   The poll results may seem strange if you are under the popular
impression that New York's many immigrants are clamoring for
bilingual education. In fact, immigrants generally want English. In
national poll by Public Agenda, a nonpartisan research organization
in New York, 75 percent of foreign-born parents said the schools'
first priority should be to teach English quickly, even if that
means that their children fall behind in other subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Bilingual programs, begun as a well-intentioned experiment in
the 1960s, proliferated thanks to federal money and orders from
bureaucrats and judges. With bilingual teachers and theorists
comfortably entrenched, the programs persisted even as parents and
researchers concluded that they didn't work. Instead of students
gradually learning English and switching to mainstream classes _
the ostensible goal of bilingual education _ they remained trapped
year after year in native-language classes.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic parents at a school in Los Angeles got so frustrated in
1996 that they started a boycott, demanding that their children
learn English. The protest led to Proposition 227, which leading
politicians, most major newspapers and the educational
establishment fiercely opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic advocacy groups called it a threat; many major
newspapers editorialized against it. The initiative was denounced
by the federal education secretary, Richard W. Riley. and the
Superintendent of California's public schools, Delaine Eastin, said
it would cause chaos in the classroom. Bilingual teachers predicted
trauma for their students.
</P>
<P>
   Unz's group was vastly outspent by the opposition, whose
advertising campaign was financed by teachers' unions and by A.
Jerrold Perenchio, the chairman of Univision, the Spanish-language
television network that stood to lose viewers if students began
learning English. But in the end, the initiative was approved by 61
percent of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   The change took effect this past year, and newspapers that had
editorialized against Proposition 227 were soon running front-page
headlines like ``English-Only Teaching Is a Surprise Hit.''
Teachers around the state marveled at how quickly students were
picking up English. Statewide tests at the end of the year yielded
no evidence of trauma or chaos: the students in the English
immersion classes had made just as much progress in all subjects as
the students in regular classes.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by the California results, Unz's group is supporting
reforms elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``A ballot initiative is probably the only way to get rid of
bilingual education in New York,'' Unz said. ``It's enormously
unpopular with the public, but the City Council and the State
Legislature pay more attention to the special interests that
benefit from the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Unz, who lived in Jackson Heights during the early years of his
software business, was not surprised at the borough-by-borough
breakdown of his poll. Bilingual education was opposed by 73
percent of the respondents in Brooklyn, 75 percent in Queens, 84
percent in the Bronx, and 85 percent in Staten Island. The least
opposition, 68 percent, was in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of liberal intellectuals in Manhattan probably support
bilingual education for ideological reasons,'' Unz said. ``It
sounds like a politically correct way to help immigrants, and they
don't have enough contact with immigrants to know the truth.
Manhattan intellectuals can afford to support bilingual education
because they're not personally affected by it. If it were their own
kids, they'd be fighting to get them into English classes.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: IOWA SPINS A POLITICAL STRAW POLL INTO GOLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMES, Iowa _ The Republican Party held a presidential straw poll
in Iowa on Saturday and to tell the truth, it was fantastic. If the
state fair over in Des Moines drew more people, it was probably
only because the Republicans could not match a sculpture of the
Last Supper made entirely out of butter.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the state fair had Little Richard in the music hall, but
the Republicans had Vic Damone in the Orrin Hatch tent! The fair
had dozens of food stands, but it could not conceivably have had as
many people doling out barbecue sandwiches as George W. Bush had.
</P>
<P>
   Under the straw poll rules, residents had to personally show up
at the state university campus to vote, so the candidates went
crazy looking for ways to entice them. Participants could get
T-shirts in nine different colors, each with a different
politician's name. One elderly woman claimed that she attended the
straw poll every four years solely to replenish her supply of dust
cloths.
</P>
<P>
   And it was all free! American politics hasn't seen this many
giveaways since the reformers put an end to drink-buying on
Election Day. Free chicken from Orrin Hatch and free ice cream from
Alan Keyes. Balloon hats from Elizabeth Dole and potholders from
Pat Buchanan. Over here, the swing dance band, over there, the face
painters.
</P>
<P>
   Diners at the Buchanan tent took away complimentary bottles of
barbecue sauce. Dan Quayle's organizers, in a telling sign, tried
to win over the undecided with bundles of raw corn. Steve Forbes
set up a whole little amusement park, behind a giant arch of
balloons, surrounded by a long, snaking line of Forbesians waiting
for their lunch. Children climbed a mountain made of foam rubber
and raced around a huge inflated dinosaur while Debbie Boone sang
``Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo'' and a clown on stilts tottered around
yelling ``Hello, America!''
</P>
<P>
   The theme of the entire Forbes effort was overspending. He was
the only Republican in the history of the Iowa straw poll who paid
to have his tent air-conditioned, and as soon as it opened for
business, the temperature dropped into the '70s. His organizers
bought more balloons to fall from the ceiling during his speech
than the eight other competitors combined, and all you could hear
was the sound of people popping them when they hit the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes spent a million dollars, maybe two, to win the hearts of
the Iowans. In the end that got him just under 5,000 votes and 21
percent of the total _ 10 percentage points less than George W.
Bush, and about 1,500 ballots more than Elizabeth Dole, whose staff
bragged that she won the contest for lowest per-voter expenditure.
</P>
<P>
   It all turned out pretty much as anticipated, although you would
have to be pretty cruel to have predicted that Lamar Alexander
would only get 1,428 votes. Given the amount of time Alexander has
spent here over the last four years, he must have been rejected
even by people who had him over for dinner and let him spend the
weekend in their guest room.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Quayle finished eighth, with 916 votes, behind Keyes, a
black candidate who claims the federal income tax is the equivalent
of slavery. All the candidates trotted their families on stage
during the final speechathon, but only Quayle forced his wife and
the kids to stand there through his entire address. ``I trust your
judgment,'' he told the Iowans. That was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The memorable thing about the Iowa straw poll was not the fact
that George Bush won it, but the spectacle of so many average
people actually enjoying themselves at a political event. The state
Republican Party may have meant to hold a cheesy self-promotion
under the guise of testing the electorate's temperature, but the
desperation of the candidates and the enthusiasm of the volunteers
turned it into something different, a family entertainment that
actually managed to make the presidential campaign temporarily
compelling.
</P>
<P>
   The straw poll drew almost 24,000 voters _ not to mention their
children, friends and ineligible onlookers. It was almost twice
what the organizers were expecting, and the fire marshals were
eventually forced to close the doors to the auditorium and turn
away regular citizens who wanted to listen to the speeches.
</P>
<P>
   A century ago, Americans ran their elections like this, with
parades and picnics and fireworks, and contests to see which
candidates' supporters could raise the tallest pole or roll the
biggest ball from one town to the next. People voted like crazy
back then, and everybody loved politics. Maybe the wheel is
turning. Maybe democracy, like Las Vegas, needs to reinvent itself
as wholesome family fun to attract a new audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my first time at one of these,'' said Vickie
Setterberg, a program assistant at Iowa State University who was
expressing her support for Elizabeth Dole by pumping air into
balloons that were then twisted to resemble dachshunds or funny
hats.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the party organizations' idea of how to involve
newcomers in the political process is to permit them to collect
signatures on candidates' petitions, and perhaps appear as
witnesses during one of the ensuing court fights over who gets to
stay on the ballot. Personally, I would rather make balloon dogs.

EDITORIAL: DEFECTS IN THE DNA LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Aug. 16:
</P>
<P>
   The potential value of DNA evidence as an identification tool in
criminal cases is vast. New York state wants to tap that potential,
but its new law expanding the collection of DNA samples from
convicted felons is deficient. Among other things, Gov. Pataki and
legislative leaders failed to address the legitimate privacy
concerns that creating an extensive DNA data bank inevitably
raises.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, starting Dec. 1, anyone convicted of one of a
long list of felonies will have a DNA profile entered into a state
database for use in solving crimes and aiding prosecutions. The law
permits DNA to be collected either from a blood sample or by taking
cells from the inside of the mouth with a cotton swab _ not an
unreasonable intrusion. The state already collects fingerprints,
and has begun taking blood samples from people convicted of sex
crimes and a few other violent offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to match DNA profiles against evidence from unsolved
cases will give police a powerful new crime-fighting tool, though
some police officials are pushing to go further and take DNA
samples from suspects as soon as they are arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The new law is silent, however, on a grave civil liberties
question. What happens to the left-over DNA sample containing
highly personal medical data and other information once a felon's
individualized digital pattern is filed on computer?
</P>
<P>
   A computerized fragment of a person's DNA that does not reveal
intimate medical details is all the state needs for criminal
identification. The law says that samples can be used only for
forensic identification, but unless the left-over blood or saliva
samples are destroyed, it is conceivable that they could lead to
invasions of privacy and other abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The law's silence on that point invites the state's forensic
science commission, which regulates DNA labs, to provide an answer.
Otherwise, the Legislature will be obliged to make sure that
samples taken for the purpose of making a high-tech fingerprint do
not get retained for potential abuse later on.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond privacy, there are major practical questions. The law
calls for collecting DNA samples from everyone now in prison, on
parole, or on probation for one of the crimes on the list _ about
100,000 people. But it earmarks no money to accomplish this
daunting feat. The state's criminal justice coordinator, Katherine
Lapp, hopes to find money in the current budget to get the system
running.
</P>
<P>
   But that still leaves two other unmet needs. No money has been
provided to build up existing lab capacity. Nor is there money to
teach police detectives how to identify and properly handle DNA
samples at crime scenes. Unless these gaps are filled, the state
will be unable to realize DNA's crime-fighting potential no matter
how big a database it builds.

EDITORIAL: RETURN OF THE TIMBER WARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Aug. 16:
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years, Mike Dombeck, the chief of the U.S.
Forest Service, has struggled to change the culture of a
notoriously stubborn agency that has long favored the harvesting of
timber in the national forests at the expense of wildlife
protection and other environmental values.
</P>
<P>
   But old habits die hard at the Forest Service, no matter who is
in charge. That is the unhappy subtext of U.S. District Judge
William Dwyer's recent ruling that the Forest Service has been
violating a landmark 1994 plan to protect the spotted owl in the
old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest, mainly by failing to
conduct wildlife surveys on federal land before approving logging
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which also faulted the Bureau of Land Management,
could halt logging on more than a half-million acres of federal
land.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer thought he had straightened out the Forest Service eight
years ago. In 1991, ruling on a lawsuit brought by
environmentalists, he found that the Reagan and Bush
administrations had systematically failed to honor their
obligations under various federal laws to protect the habitat of
the spotted owl in the old-growth forests in northern California,
Washington and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer's ruling effectively shut down the logging business until
1994, when the Clinton administration brokered a compromise. Under
the plan, the timber industry's annual cut in the region was set at
1.1 billion board feet, greatly reduced from its mid-1980s high of
5 billion board feet. Some old-growth trees would be cut to meet
that target, but about two-thirds of them would be preserved.
</P>
<P>
   The plan included other protections, including the survey
requirement. In exchange, the administration provided job
retraining for displaced loggers.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation that the Forest Service _ specifically, Dombeck's
subordinates on the regional and local level _ failed to honor a
key part of this agreement is disturbing. Yet some good may yet
come of it.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it may shock Dombeck into paying much closer
attention to what his people on the ground are actually doing or,
in this case, not doing. This is not the first time he has been
blind-sided.
</P>
<P>
   For another, it could focus congressional attention on a
pernicious rider to the Interior Appropriations bill that would in
effect legalize the very behavior that Dwyer found illegal. Slipped
into the bill by pro-logging Northwestern senators before the
judge's decision, the rider would excuse Forest Service employees
from their legal duty to conduct detailed wildlife surveys, not
only in the Pacific Northwest but in all national forests.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Dwyer ruling could usefully refocus the
administration's attention on the 1994 compromise plan, which needs
strengthening. Officials at the Oregon Natural Resources Council,
which brought the recent suit, have said that they can live with
the 1994 plan if it is scrupulously followed. But the plan still
presupposes the loss of up to a third of the old-growth trees.
</P>
<P>
   Dombeck might therefore begin thinking of ways to save those
trees, perhaps by reducing the timber harvest, or by expanding his
previously announced policy of banning new logging roads in the
national forests to include those in the Pacific Northwest, which
have so far been exempted from the ban.
</P>
<P>
   Both moves would infuriate powerful senators who underwrite
Dombeck's budget. But it would be a good way to atone for his
agency's indifference.

ON 100TH VFW ANNIVERSARY, SERVICE TO MEMBERS IS WHAT COUNTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Ranks and medals are not flaunted at Post 2995.
War stories, particularly the self-aggrandizing type, are
discouraged. The blue organizational cap studded with service pins
is rarely seen here, used only on formal occasions.
</P>
<P>
   In this spacious, 3-year-old building on 148th Avenue that
houses the Eastside's largest post of the Veterans of Foreign Wars
of the United States, there are only two things that count:
</P>
<P>
   Honorable service in the U.S. military in a foreign conflict and
continued service, as a VFW member, to fellow veterans in need of
help.
</P>
<P>
   As 30,000 members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars gather in
Kansas City, Mo., this week to celebrate the 100th anniversary of
America's oldest national veterans organization, local VFW members
continue to work out of the spotlight in a variety of grassroots
programs to help other veterans and citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the reputation that we only drink at the bar and march
in parades,'' said John Kenny, a decorated World War II veteran and
Post 2995 member for 15 years. ``Nothing could be farther from the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Each post has a full-time case officer trained to act as a
go-between for veterans having problems obtaining medical or other
benefits, Kenny said. At each local organization, there is an
appointed ``surgeon'' responsible for visiting hospitalized
veterans with flowers or other gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, the Redmond, Wash., VFW post has run a monthly meals
program for the homeless at a Seattle shelter, gathering to create
several hundred meals and then transporting them to the facility.
``We found that 70 percent of the homeless there were veterans,''
Kenny said.
</P>
<P>
   VFW officials and local members say they are saddened that fewer
and fewer Americans have direct connections to the military and to
those who have served in past wars.
</P>
<P>
   Post member Don Leonard, who runs the unit's business affairs,
said, ``I go to the bank, and the teller always asks me, `What is
the VFW?'''
</P>
<P>
   With a membership of 2.1 million veterans, the VFW remains an
influential organization in terms of lobbying in Washington, D.C.,
for veterans' benefits and on behalf of a strong military.
</P>
<P>
   But organization officials say it is an uphill struggle to
maintain an adequate level of medical and other benefits for
retired vets, particularly in the wake of recent budget cuts of 20
percent in the Veterans Affairs medical system.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are 8.1 million living World War II veterans, the
youngest of whom are in their mid-70s, and their requirements for
medical care will increase dramatically in the years ahead, said
Kenny, who works on legislative issues for Post 2995. Another 6
million veterans served in the Korean War era a decade later.
</P>
<P>
   While at national and state headquarters the VFW's focus is on
lobbying to ensure the protection of veterans' rights, local posts
take a more hands-on approach, said Dick Keeton, a senior state VFW
official. ``Our top priority is service work, helping veterans in
hospitals and their family members,'' Keeton said.
</P>
<P>
   Local VFW posts are involved in a wide variety of sponsorship
programs for other civic groups. For instance, Post 2995 provides
space and support for a local Civil Air Patrol chapter. The post
also supports the Marine Corps' annual ``Toys for Tots'' charity
program and provides meeting space for a local Cub Scout pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come here to be among my peers,'' said Bud Thackrah, 67, a
retired Bellevue resident whose burly forearms sport tattoos from
his service as a Marine in the Korean War. ``The VFW is my home
away from home, and here there is a great spirit of being with
people who are responsible for ... keeping America free.''
</P>
<P>
   The aging of the World War II and Korean veteran populations has
led to a generational shift within the VFW and other veterans'
groups in recent years. Most of the current leadership positions at
VFW Post 2995 are held by Vietnam-era veterans who have the time
and energy to do the business at hand, Leonard said.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, a decorated combat veteran of Vietnam with the 1st
Infantry Division, noted he was born the same year _ 1944 _ that
his VFW comrade Kenny arrived in New Guinea to join the 32nd
Infantry Division as a machine gunner in the bloody ``island
hopping'' campaign by Gen. Douglas MacArthur that culminated in the
postwar occupation of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But at Post 2995 neither rank nor date of service matter much.
Other things do.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, Thackrah excused himself early from the afternoon
social hour.
</P>
<P>
   It was time for a nighttime mission, sitting at the bedside of a
friend, a Persian Gulf War veteran, who lies near death at the
Seattle VA hospital.
