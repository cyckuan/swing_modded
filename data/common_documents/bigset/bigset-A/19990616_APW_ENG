<HEADLINE> Unabomber Wants Conviction Reviewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Theodore Kaczynski asked an appeals  
court today to review his conviction for the deadly Unabomber 
attacks, saying the judge at his trial was unfair and his lawyers 
wrongly went ahead with a mental illness defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski, who pleaded guilty in January 1998 to a string of  
bombings that killed three people and injured 23 others, said his 
plea was coerced partly by defense attorneys and partly by a 
hostile judge who rejected his request to change lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	He made his contention in a handwritten request to the 9th U.S.  
Circuit Court of Appeals for a review of his case. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski, 57, a Harvard-trained mathematician turned forest  
recluse who lived more than two decades in a tiny Montana shack, is 
serving a life sentence in Colorado for a string of Unabomber 
attacks between 1978 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the deaths, which Kaczynski said was part of an  
anti-technology crusade, happened in Sacramento; the third was in 
New Jersey. Federal authorities dubbed the case ``Unabom'' because 
the early targets were linked to universities or airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski said that but for the mistakes of the judge and his  
lawyers, who believed a mental-defect defense offered the best 
chance of saving Kaczynski from execution, he ``would not have 
pleaded guilty and would have gone to trial.''

<HEADLINE> Fans Root for Women's World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Intimidated? Try honored.  
</P>
<P>
	The Women's World Cup will open Saturday at Giants Stadium,  
which will be filled with at least 74,000 fans eager for a taste of 
soccer at its highest level. Nearly all will be on hand to root for 
the host United States when it plays Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	Does that scare the Danes? Hardly.  
</P>
<P>
	``It shouldn't be scary,'' said captain Lene Terp, who has  
played in 56 international games for her country. ``It should be 
exciting. It should be special. 
</P>
<P>
	``There'll be a lot of Brazilian and Mexican people there, too.  
I hope they'll cheer for us. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest crowd we ever played before was at the Olympics'  
opening game, about 30,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That also was against the United States. Oddly, the Americans  
also began the 1995 World Cup, in which they finished third as the 
defending champions, with a match vs. Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	``Denmark is a very formidable team for us to open with,'' U.S.  
veteran Brandi Chastain said. ``It wasn't an easy game with them in 
the Olympics, and we expect it to be a tough game Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a testament to the federations of countries around the  
world that they are recognizing women deserve a place to play and a 
chance to play. That's important to us, because without that 
growth, we aren't going to get better. They're causing us to 
evaluate what we are doing and move us in an improved direction 
tactically and physically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Danes are led by Terp, a defender, and striker Gitte Krogh,  
who is their active leader with 25 international goals in 62 games. 
They also feature Mikka Hansen, who was born in California, grew up 
there and was a member of the under-21 national team before joining 
the Danes in January. Hansen's father is Danish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think any of us have played before so many people,''  
Hansen said. ``Maybe it's to the Americans' advantage, but there 
also is a lot of pressure on them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I feel for my friends on the team. The pressure is  
there because they are supposed to win. So maybe it's not such an 
advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the United States, which has an expressed goal of winning  
the title it took in the initial World Cup in 1991, Denmark -- and 
nearly every other team -- claims it's after a berth in the 2000 
Sydney Olympics. A spot in the quarterfinals would assure 
qualification, provided Australia also makes the final eight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Denmark respects our team when it wins,'' Hansen said. ``So if  
we qualify for the Olympics, it will help soccer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denmark coach Jorgen Hvidemose knows one sure way to pique  
interest back home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It depends on the results,'' he said. ``When we solidly beat  
the Americans, they will join us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the members of the Brazil and Mexico teams attending a news  
conference to kick off the tournament chuckled. Of course, 
Hvidemose was laughing as he made his bold statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilians, who face Mexico in the second game of the  
doubleheader -- later Saturday, at San Jose, it's China vs. Sweden 
and Japan against Canada -- have improved rapidly through the 
decade. While hardly the perennial favorite the Brazilian men 
always are, they now are considered a threat in this tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since our success of the 1996 Olympics, when we were fourth  
place, the major clubs in Brazil have taken women's soccer under 
their umbrella,'' coach Wilson de Oliveira said. ``Through leagues 
and playing better opponents, they are better prepared to play for 
the national team in the South American championships and then the 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big thing for women in Brazil and the whole world  
and we are glad to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico, which has nearly as many Americans on its roster as  
native Mexicans, didn't even have a team for the '96 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a growing program,'' coach Leonardo Cuellar said. ``Our  
federation is excited and our country is behind us, and we expect 
in the near future to be contenders. We've worked very hard to give 
them good competition and be one of the surprises of this World 
Cup.''

<HEADLINE> Warner-Lambert Loses in Pfizer Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a tussle between pharmaceutical titans,  
Pfizer Inc. appears to have gotten the better of a high-profile 
partnership deal with Warner-Lambert Co. to market each other's 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer on Wednesday gave Warner-Lambert the right to co-promote  
and split profits of its upcoming migraine drug Relpax. The move 
fulfills an agreement that in 1997 gave Pfizer co-marketing rights 
to Warner-Lambert's new cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor, which 
has become a blockbuster medication. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's highly doubtful that Relpax will make even half as much  
money as Lipitor. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Lipitor should generate $3.3 billion in sales -- five  
times the $600 million in expected peak sales of Relpax. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner-Lambert retains the option to re-open the deal with the  
New York-based Pfizer if it is unsatisfied with Relpax sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem Warner-Lambert faced is that Pfizer has nothing in  
its pipeline expected to garner sales approaching Lipitor's level. 
The Morris Plains, N.J.-based Warner-Lambert reportedly was seeking 
to share profits from multiple Pfizer drugs, but Pfizer maintained 
their agreement only called for it to share rights to a single 
product. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither company would comment on the details of the Lipitor  
agreement, except that Warner-Lambert said it retains most of 
Lipitor profits. 
</P>
<P>
	By 2002, Lipitor sales are expected to hit $5 billion, making it  
the world's best-selling prescription drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is difficult to get a quid (pro quo) on any product the  
magnitude of Lipitor,'' said Peter B. Corr, president of research 
and development at Warner-Lambert's drug division Parke-Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner-Lambert officials maintain they're getting a good deal  
from Pfizer. Relpax should do well because studies show it works 
more quickly than existing migraine drugs, they say. Still, about 
95 million Americans have high cholesterol compared to about 20 
million who suffer from migraine headaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Relpax is awaiting federal approval, which is expected to come  
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipitor, which benefited greatly from Pfizer's massive field  
staff, has made Warner-Lambert the fastest growing major drugmaker 
that last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were hoping the completion of the Pfizer deal could  
have provided an incremental earnings boost. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the wild card in Warner-Lambert's bull story, and I  
think the wild card has come up empty,'' said Jack Lamberton, an 
analyst with HSBC Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal shows Pfizer's negotiating muscle, Lamberton added.  
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer and Warner-Lambert on Wednesday also agreed to explore  
making a combination Liptor-Norvasc pill to help people with high 
blood pressure and high cholesterol. Norvasc, the nation's top 
selling blood pressure drug, is Pfizer's biggest selling drug with 
$2.6 billion in 1998 sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a combination pill could take four years or more to bring  
to market. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies also agreed to work together to find new uses  
for Lipitor, including treating angina and other heart ailments. 
Pfizer and Warner-Lambert will continue to co-market Lipitor for 
the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading on the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday, Pfizer rose  
$1.56 1/4 to $99.12 1/2, while Warner-Lambert rose 56 1/4 cents to $62.25.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Officials Don't See Fallout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- State Olympic officials say they foresee  
no economic fallout from the Salt Lake bid scandal that shook the 
Olympic community. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people are going to come and the tickets are going to be  
sold,'' state Olympic officer John Fowler told a legislative 
committee on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	By 2002, he said, the scandal sparked by gifts, lavish treatment  
and cash payments to International Olympic Committee officials will 
be little more than a footnote. 
</P>
<P>
	The games are expected to generate $2.8 billion overall for the  
economy; 14,261 jobs at the peak; $236 million in state and local 
revenue and between $80 million and $140 million in state and local 
taxes, based on projections made by the Governor's Office of 
Planning and Budget last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	In the months after the scandal broke late last year, state  
officials considered revamping those projections. But Fowler said 
the projections were conservative enough that ``There is absolutely 
no reason to believe that we won't meet or exceed the figures that 
we've set.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, Mitt  
Romney, has proposed reducing the SLOC budget from $1.4 billion to 
$1.1 billion because of difficulty in attracting big-budget 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Romney's pared-back spending projections are about $250,000  
higher than spending figures used in the state revenue projections, 
and federal government assistance for the games has also been 
higher than projected, Fowler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wish the scandal hadn't happened, there's no question about  
it. And has it impaired the marketing effort of SLOC? There's no 
question it has,'' he said. But he said sponsors and the public 
remain interested in the games. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, says Dean Reeder, director of the Utah Travel Council,  
Utah's name recognition and interest abroad rose sharply in the 
six-week period after the scandal broke. Calls to the Travel 
Council's 800-number doubled, and hits to the council's Website 
tripled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hungry for another scandal. The last one was really good  
for us,'' Reeder says, jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the scandal actually increased visits to the state is  
not yet known. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess the lesson to be learned from this sorry episode is  
there's always a silver lining to scandal, because so much of 
marketing has to do with name recognition,'' Fowler said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Legislature's Business, Labor and Economic Development  
Interim Committee also heard Wednesday from Brad Barber, deputy 
director of the Governor's Office of Planning and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
	He said both Calgary, which hosted the 1988 Olympics, and  
Atlanta, which hosted the 1996 Summer Games, have experienced 
substantial economic growth since their games. 
</P>
<P>
	Both cities saw a dip in unemployment, followed by a slight  
correction, but on the whole Atlanta's economy remains stronger 
than Georgia's, and Calgary's better than the rest of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had a little boom and a little bust, but they have had  
substantial economic growth since,'' Barber said. Utah should 
expect a similar trend. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeder pressed lawmakers to spend money on advertising to spread  
the state's name, prolonging the post-Olympic tourism boom. 
</P>
<P>
	And Dan Leonard, an executive committee member on the Utah  
Sports Authority, urged lawmakers to create some method of 
capitalizing on the state's Olympic venues and its status as a 
sports haven to seek out sporting events for the state. 
</P>
<P>
	That could mean committing more money for the Utah Winter Sports  
Park, he said. The SLOC is obligated to give the state $40 million 
for a legacy fund to run the ski jump and bobsled venues near Park 
City, but the interest from that fund will not be enough to keep 
the venues operating, Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a period of time a decision will have to be made whether  
to mothball these or seek other funding,'' he said. ``We'll eat our 
seed-corn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Hickman, R-St. George, warned Olympic officials to not  
expect Utah taxpayers to cover any funding shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state, frankly, has other needs,'' Hickman said. ``The  
primary responsibility for this is not with the state.''

<HEADLINE> Dierker Recovers From Brain Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Drowsy but upbeat, Houston Astros manager Larry  
Dierker emerged from brain surgery joking about his aggressive 
managing style. 
</P>
<P>
	``He says he's still going to do it,'' a laughing Dr. Rob  
Parrish said, after the Methodist Hospital neurosurgeon removed two 
tangled sets of blood vessels from the front of Dierker's brain 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just asked him, `Did I get the stealing third with two outs,  
out?' and he said, `No, we're still going to go.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros recently lost a game when the last out was made on an  
attempted steal of third. 
</P>
<P>
	All jokes aside, Dierker's faces four weeks of convalescence  
following the 5 1/2-hour surgery that sliced the ruptured snarl of 
blood vessels, known as an arteriovenous malformation, free from 
his brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``As Larry said, `They always say don't worry about it, it's not  
brain surgery, but it's brain surgery,''' Parrish said. 
``Certainly, it's serious surgery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mass touched off a seizure in Dierker's brain Sunday night  
after the 52-year-old manager collapsed in the Astros dugout in the 
eighth inning of the team's game against the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was suspended as his fearful players watched Dierker  
placed into an ambulance and rushed to Methodist Hospital, where 
tests located a life-threatening hemorrhage in the right side of 
his brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having an AVM that ruptures is certainly life-threatening,''  
said Parrish, who credited Houston paramedics' quick response and 
attention to keeping Dierker's airway free of obstruction, with 
saving his life. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgeon speculated that the vessels might have burst two  
days before Dierker collapsed. Dierker had complained to friends of 
headaches days before the seizure overcame him. 
</P>
<P>
	Parrish removed the large mass located by the tests and a  
smaller group of burst vessels in the same area. Sunday's tests 
failed to detect the smaller mass because of its size. 
</P>
<P>
	The larger part of the malformation was described by Parrish as  
``significant, 4-by-3 centimeters ... bigger than a walnut, smaller 
than a melon -- maybe a lime, or a really big jalapeno.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeons cut a ``window'' in Dierker's skull to access the  
target area, and the problem vessels were located just beneath the 
surface of the front part of Dierker's brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took the blood clot out, sent the blood clot to pathology  
to make absolutely sure there was no tumor or anything -- and there 
was none,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``After we got it out, we sewed him up and put his bone flap  
back in the window we had made in his skull, so he'll be 
hard-headed,'' Parrish said. Nineteen tiny screws were used to 
close the area. The blood vessels were closed with small titanium 
clips, Parrish said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Dierker asked him before the surgery: ``You mean no more  
head butts?'' And Parrish said he replied: ``Yes. No more head 
butts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the surgeon's making jokes, I guess the skipper is going to  
be OK,'' Jeff Bagwell said. ``Obviously, we're greatly relieved. 
The news has just been getting better every day. It's a breath of 
fresh air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Methodist Hospital officials said Dierker, known for his  
laid-back attitude and affinity for Hawaiian shirts, was upbeat 
headed into surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Parrish said Dierker should be back in the dugout before the  
season ends. He will be undergo another series of tests in a week 
and should be home within 5-10 days of the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Later this week we'll do another angiogram to make absolutely  
certain we got all of it out,'' Parrish said. ``He's awake, alert 
and following commands and looks quite good right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There should be no after-effects to speech, memory or motion.  
</P>
<P>
	``I expect him to be completely intact,'' Parrish said.  
</P>
<P>
	Parrish said once Dierker was revived by the anesthesiologist,  
Parrish said his patient greeted him with a ``Hi Rob!'' and raised 
his hand in a high-five motion. 
</P>
<P>
	Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said Dierker smiled at  
him through an oxygen mask and gave him a thumbs-up signal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best we could have hoped for,'' Astros owner  
Drayton McLane said. ``We're very pleased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a visit by Craig Biggio and Bagwell on Monday, Dierker  
told them to go out and win three out of four games from the 
Atlanta Braves. Houston won 10-4 Monday night and lost 4-3 Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Interim manager Matt Galante directed the team seated next to  
Dierker's empty chair. The team hung Dierker's No. 49 jersey in the 
dugout above his seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Parrish said Dierker watched Monday night's game on television  
and expected the manager to watch Tuesday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker was the third member of the Astros staff to become ill  
this season. First-base coach Jose Cruz left the team May 10 
because of an irregular heartbeat, and hitting coach Tom McCraw 
left six days later for prostate cancer treatment. Cruz is expected 
back this week.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Ban on Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- President Clinton, opening a week's diplomacy in  
Europe in the aftermath of NATO's Kosovo bombing campaign, today 
urged the U.S. Senate and governments worldwide to accept a new 
treaty banning what he called ``vicious forms of abusive child 
labor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are children chained to often-risky machines, children  
handling dangerous chemicals, children forced to work when they 
should be in school, preparing themselves and their countries for a 
better tomorrow,'' the president told the International Labor 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, the first U.S. president to address the ILO, arrived  
here at the start of a European swing whose agenda is dominated by 
peacekeeping in Kosovo and by economic agreements among the 
industrial powers -- chiefly an overhaul of Europe's financial 
systems and a package of debt relief for the world's poorest 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	After an overnight flight, the president met privately with  
Swiss President Ruth Dreifuss to discuss humanitarian aid to the 
ethnic Albanian refugees who fled Kosovo and reconstruction of the 
Serbian province. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Clinton promised he would promptly send to the  
Senate for ratification the ILO's long-negotiated treaty intended 
to eradicate abusive child labor. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization, an arm of the United Nations, estimates that  
at least 250 million children, ages 5 to 14, work in developing 
countries -- nearly half of them full-time and tens of millions 
under exploitative and harmful conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	A broad treaty on reducing child labor was negotiated by the ILO  
in 1972 but never mustered full support of its 174 member nations. 
The new treaty targets only the most egregious forms of child 
servitude, including forced prostitution, pornography, bondage and 
military service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regardless of country, regardless of circumstances, these are  
not some archaic practices out of a Charles Dickens novel,'' 
Clinton said. ``These are things that happen in too many places 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his wife and daughter watching from the gallery of Assembly  
Hall in the Palace of Nations overlooking Lake Geneva, the 
president added: ``We must wipe from the Earth the most vicious 
forms of abusive child labor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We must put a human face on the global economy, giving working  
people everywhere a stake in its success, equipping them all to 
reap its rewards, providing for their families the basic conditions 
of a just society,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised the United States would ``contribute our share to an  
expanded trust fund for debt relief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From Geneva, Clinton was flying to Paris to dine with French  
President Jacques Chirac. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Clinton is to meet with leaders in France and then  
depart for Germany to attend the 25th annual economic summit of the 
world's seven richest nations, joined by Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Clinton is to attend a U.S.-European Union summit and  
then travel to Slovenia, a country slightly smaller than New Jersey 
that declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 and wants to 
join NATO the European Union, which is striving to foster political 
cooperation and economic integration among European nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton previewed his address to the ILO last week, when he  
signed an executive order directing U.S. government agencies to 
make sure they do not buy products made by forced or indentured 
child workers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the U.S. government bought $57 million in products made  
by industries known to rely on child labor, according to Sen. Tom 
Harkin, D-Iowa, the leading Senate proponent of child-labor reform 
and who is accompanying Clinton on the trip. The Clinton 
administration has identified several problem industries, including 
carpets and bricks from India and Pakistan, fishing platforms from 
Indonesia and fireworks from Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
	The economic summit that begins Friday in Cologne, Germany, will  
be a meeting of the Group of Eight, comprising leaders of Russia, 
the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and 
Canada. The leaders are to discuss who will pay to rebuild Kosovo 
and help neighboring Balkan countries following NATO's 78-day 
bombing campaign of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We welcome the European Union's intention to assume the lion's  
share of the financial burden and, given the U.S. role in the 
military campaign, this is an appropriate division of labor,'' 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Other topics to be broached include human rights, the  
environment, trade, terrorism, drug trafficking and crime.

	Gore Makes His Candidacy Official  
</P>
<P>
	CARTHAGE, Tenn. (AP) -- Al Gore promised an all-consuming ``fight  
for America's families'' in a presidential announcement address 
that declared his commitment to moral leadership. ``Our families 
are loved, but overstretched,'' the vice president said. Gore, the 
front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, claimed a 
share of credit for the six-year economic recovery under President 
Clinton, but said the work is not complete. With unemployment low 
and the stock market high, parents are still working too hard and 
spending too much time away from their children,'' Gore said.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans put on a show of their own in  
Washington today as Vice-president Al Gore was announcing his White 
House candidacy in Carthage, Tennessee. Republican National 
Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson arrived at Gore's childhood home -- 
a luxurious downtown Washington hotel -- by mule-driven cart and led 
reporters on a tour of the three suites where Gore spent his youth 
while his father was in Congress. The mule routine was a response 
to comments Gore made in March about spending youthful summers 
plowing fields on his family's farm in Carthage.

isolated cases of broken-down vehicles, a NATO spokesman, Maj. 
Lewis Garneau, said today. Under the peace agreement, all 40,000 
Serb forces are to be out of Kosovo by Sunday night; NATO said 
today 26,000 have left. Meanwhile, ethnic Albanian refugees were 
pouring back into Kosovo at the crossing on the Albanian border, 
creating backups of all kinds of vehicles.

South Korean aircraft today in patrolling over disputed waters in 
the Yellow Sea, after a high-seas shootout sank one North Korean 
gunboat, damaged five others and may have killed 30 sailors. Five 
North Korean warships stopped just outside the boundary today and 
did not try to move into the disputed waters, the South Korean 
Defense Ministry said. Entry into the contested zone by North 
Korean ships provoked yesterday's brief battle. North Korea, 
describing the situation as grave, released a statement today that 
suspended visits by South Koreans to the capital, Pyongyang, but 
not to other parts of the country.

was also known as Sara Jane Olson, was arrested without incident.

<HEADLINE> A&AMP;E Studies Career of Brian Wilson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A British writer, Nik Cohn, once described Brian  
Wilson's peak with the Beach Boys, the album ``Pet Sounds,'' as 
``sad songs about loneliness and heartache. Sad songs, even, about 
happiness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watching A&AMP;E Network's two-hour documentary on Wilson  
(premiering Sunday at 8 p.m. ET) is like listening to some of those 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
	It's sad, often unbearably so. While illuminating, even  
entertaining with all of the music, the documentary is a melancholy 
account of a life filled with disharmony. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson's tale is one of rock 'n' roll's most familiar: the  
California boy with the overbearing father who sang of sun and fun 
with his brothers and cousin. He was intensely creative and 
musically innovative until he fell off a cliff of mental illness 
and substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 30 years since, he has watched both his brothers die,  
been sued by his cousin and struggled to regain at least his 
sanity, if not his creative powers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brian is high tragedy,'' said producer Morgan Neville.  
``That's why so many people are drawn to the story. I tried to 
temper it with the brilliance of the music. It's been the one thing 
in life that has given him solace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The story's attractiveness was also a challenge for Neville,  
since it has been told before in documentaries and books. Neville 
plays it straight, avoiding the temptations to wallow in the 
melodrama or favor one faction's opinion over another's. 
</P>
<P>
	In a subtle distinction, he starts from the beginning, instead  
of working back from a picture of how Wilson changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to tell the story in a way that almost suspends the  
knowledge,'' he said. ``You can see the changes happen, but you 
don't have that sense of dread. You understand how he got there, 
you understand that Brian is not some crazy nut, but that there are 
deep-seated reasons for what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the fall, it feels like a race against time, a race to  
get such songs as ``Good Vibrations'' and ``God Only Knows'' from 
Wilson's head onto records before he succumbs to the years of 
playing a piano in a sandbox or staying in bed day after day. 
</P>
<P>
	Neville said it was like a biblical parable, of an innocent man  
who has been given a beautiful gift to share with others but at the 
price of destroying him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really hard to convey how wide-eyed he is,'' he said.  
``That leads you to do one of two things -- you either want to take 
advantage of him or take care of him. And most of the people he's 
run into do one or the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson's late father sold the publishing rights to his son's  
songs for pittance, and Wilson failed in his effort to get them 
back. His cousin, Mike Love, sued Wilson seeking compensation for 
songs which he claimed he helped write. 
</P>
<P>
	Love didn't cooperate with the A&AMP;E biography, but Wilson did. He  
invited Neville into his home and spoke candidly of his life. His 
daughters, singing stars Wendy and Carnie, describe in 
heartbreaking detail their efforts to become a part of their dad's 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson still works, but the two solo albums he has made during  
the last dozen years are bland and forgettable. In the meantime, 
his critical reputation for the 1960s work has blossomed. A new 
generation of artists cite his work as an influence, and the 
British music magazine Mojo last year declared ``Pet Sounds'' the 
best rock album of all time, a distinction that in many polls had 
gone to the Beatles' ``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He seems happy, remarried and living in Illinois, and is even  
giving some of his first solo concerts. And yet... 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a hard time with the ending,'' Neville said. ``There's  
no happy ending. There's no tragic ending. It's somewhere in 
between. And that's the hardest thing to grapple with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So he recounts some poignant conversations. Former collaborator  
Van Dyke Parks tells how Wilson recently said to him, ``my work is 
done, I think. I did my work. When I was young, I worked very 
hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson's wife, Melinda, says she lies in bed some nights as her  
husband is downstairs playing the piano, singing a breathtaking 
melody. She'll bound down the steps and ask why he doesn't record 
the material. He'll shrug. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to stop asking him for something,'' said Billy Corgan,  
lead singer and songwriter for Smashing Pumpkins, and an unabashed 
and articulate Beach Boys fan. ``He's already given it. If he wants 
to give more, great. The choice is his.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As they all talk, the song ``In My Room'' plays softly in the  
background. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	LEAR'S RETURN: Who says all TV series are about people in their  
20s? Veteran producer Norman Lear, creator of ``All in the 
Family,'' is developing an animated series about old age. ``Til The 
Fat Lady Sings'' will focus on a group of elderly people who meet 
each day in a senior citizens' recreation facility. ``Death and 
dying, infirmity and old age -- there is as much cutting-edge humor 
and potential for outrage in this subject matter as in anything 
television has dealt with before,'' Lear said. He also said his 
show -- which has not been scheduled for air anywhere yet -- will be 
a celebration of people who make the most of their later years.

<HEADLINE>  Pope Resumes Trip After Having Flu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STARY SACZ, Poland (AP) -- Feeling better today after a touch of  
flu, Pope John Paul II greeted hundreds of thousands of relieved 
faithful, who cheered ``Long live the pope!'' as he resumed his 
pilgrimage to Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, after canceling all his public appearances and staying in  
bed Tuesday, the frail, 79-year-old pope decided to drop a 
last-minute trip to Armenia planned for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 700,000 people -- including Polish Prime Minister Jerzy  
Buzek, Hungarian President Arpad Goencz and Slovak Prime Minister 
Mikulas Dzurinda -- welcomed John Paul in Stary Sacz, a southern 
tourist center in the mountains outside Krakow, not far from where 
John Paul used to hike and climb as a young man. 
</P>
<P>
	He walked to the altar, leaning on his staff, then was helped by  
two priests up the three steps to his chair. ``Long live the 
pope,'' the crowd chanted, receiving a smile and blessing from the 
pope in return. 
</P>
<P>
	He sounded healthier during the Mass compared to his last speech  
Monday night, when his voice was weak and trembling. But his left 
side was shaking noticeably. 
</P>
<P>
	Krakow's archbishop, Cardinal Franciszek Macharski, read the  
four-page homily for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said the pope is ``fine,  
except for his voice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vatican has never given a detailed medical report on the  
pope's overall condition, but Navarro-Valls said three years ago 
that John Paul suffered from an extrapyramidal syndrome, a motor 
system problem that could be Parkinson's disease. The pope also has 
had both a broken leg and a hip replacement in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the faithful arrived near dawn and stood in the cold  
rain for hours without knowing if the pope would appear -- 
illustrating the intensity of feeling Poles have for the first 
Polish pope. 
</P>
<P>
	The news that John Paul was well enough to attend was greeted  
with a mixture of relief and sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wouldn't be the same Mass without him,'' said Elzbieta  
Gomirska, 40, one of the early arrivals. ``But I feel sorry for 
him. He's an old man and the weather is bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pontiff stayed in bed Tuesday due to what the Vatican called  
a touch of flu. But Navarro-Valls said the fever was gone today and 
the pope would resume his schedule as planned. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the pope was not taking any medication.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Holy Father is feeling better,'' said Polish Bishop Jan  
Chrapek, the chief tour organizer. 
</P>
<P>
	But John Paul canceled a Friday trip to Armenia to meet the  
ailing Orthodox patriarch and will return to Rome as originally 
scheduled on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Armenia visit, which was tacked on to the end of the 13-day  
pilgrimage to Poland just Monday, ``cannot be done in these 
circumstances,'' Navarro-Valls said, adding that it would be 
rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Giving the pope more time to rest, the Vatican also postponed a  
visit scheduled for Sunday to Rome's Sanctuary of Divine Love, 
where he was to celebrate a Mass and dedicate a church. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the long trip, John Paul has mixed thanksgiving for  
the toppling of communism 10 years ago -- a development his papacy 
helped inspire -- with warnings to his countrymen not to lose touch 
with their Catholic heritage as they build the new free-market 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	But the final days in the region of his birth included some  
nostalgic stops as well. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, he was to pay his respects at his parents' grave  
and meet with a small group of friends in Krakow's Wawel Cathedral, 
where he celebrated his first Mass upon becoming a priest in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
	At today's Mass, the pope canonized a 13th century Polish  
princess, citing her devotion to God and country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do not be afraid to be saints,'' his homily said. ``Today's  
world needs the holiness of Christians who in the ordinary 
conditions of family and professional life take on their proper 
daily duties ... in the spirit of love of God and neighbor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Princess Kinga, the daughter of a Hungarian king, devoted much  
of her wealth to building her adopted homeland and founded a 
convent in 1280. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end, he greeted pilgrims from Hungary, the Czech Republic  
and Slovakia in their native tongues, then reminisced about his own 
trips in the region years ago. Many people there wore traditional 
highland dress and he was serenaded with fiddles playing mountain 
music. 
</P>
<P>
	``For many years this soil has been very dear to me,'' he said  
to loud applause.

pope's overall condition, but Navarro-Valls said three years ago 
that John Paul suffered from an extrapyramidal syndrome, a motor 
system problem that could be Parkinson's disease. The pope also has 
had both a broken leg and a hip replacement in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the faithful arrived near dawn and stood in the cold  
rain for hours without knowing if the pope would appear -- 
illustrating the intensity of feeling Poles have for the first 
Polish pope. 
</P>
<P>
	The news that John Paul was well enough to attend was greeted  
with a mixture of relief and sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wouldn't be the same Mass without him,'' said Elzbieta  
Gomirska, 40, one of the early arrivals. ``But I feel sorry for 
him. He's an old man and the weather is bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pontiff stayed in bed Tuesday due to what the Vatican called  
a touch of flu. But Navarro-Valls said the fever was gone today and 
the pope would resume his schedule as planned. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the pope was not taking any medication.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Holy Father is feeling better,'' said Polish Bishop Jan  
Chrapek, the chief tour organizer. 
</P>
<P>
	But John Paul canceled a Friday trip to Armenia to meet the  
ailing Orthodox patriarch and will return to Rome as originally 
scheduled on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Armenia visit, which was tacked on to the end of the 13-day  
pilgrimage to Poland just Monday, ``cannot be done in these 
circumstances,'' Navarro-Valls said, adding that it would be 
rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Giving the pope more time to rest, the Vatican also postponed a  
visit scheduled for Sunday to Rome's Sanctuary of Divine Love, 
where he was to celebrate a Mass and dedicate a church. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the long trip, John Paul has mixed thanksgiving for  
the toppling of communism 10 years ago -- a development his papacy 
helped inspire -- with warnings to his countrymen not to lose touch 
with their Catholic heritage as they build the new free-market 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	But the final days in the region of his birth included some  
nostalgic stops as well. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, he was to pay his respects at his parents' grave  
and meet with a small group of friends in Krakow's Wawel Cathedral, 
where he celebrated his first Mass upon becoming a priest in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
	At today's Mass, the pope canonized a 13th century Polish  
princess, citing her devotion to God and country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do not be afraid to be saints,'' his homily said. ``Today's  
world needs the holiness of Christians who in the ordinary 
conditions of family and professional life take on their proper 
daily duties ... in the spirit of love of God and neighbor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Princess Kinga, the daughter of a Hungarian king, devoted much  
of her wealth to building her adopted homeland and founded a 
convent in 1280. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end, he greeted pilgrims from Hungary, the Czech Republic  
and Slovakia in their native tongues, then reminisced about his own 
trips in the region years ago. Many people there wore traditional 
highland dress and he was serenaded with fiddles playing mountain 
music. 
</P>
<P>
	``For many years this soil has been very dear to me,'' he said  
to loud applause.

<HEADLINE> Smits, Pacers Await Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *AP Sports Writers    	
</P>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Rik Smits is in no hurry to decide whether  
to walk away from more than $12 million -- even if his feet are 
hurting. 
</P>
<P>
	Smits was quoted Monday in the Dutch daily De Volkskrant as  
saying he might retire because of the pain. On Wednesday, he backed 
away from such talk after meeting with club president Donnie Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got the whole summer to make a decision. That's what I'll  
do,'' said the 7-foot-4 Dutch native. 
</P>
<P>
	Smits, who turns 33 in August, has faced a series of problems  
with his size-21 feet in recent years. He averaged 14.9 points and 
5.6 rebounds during the regular season, his lowest marks in both 
categories since 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
	Smits, who was named to the NBA All-Star team in 1998, has one  
year remaining on his contract and is due to receive a base salary 
of $12,125,000 next season. With incentives, he could earn more 
than $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not about playing for the money. That's the last thing I  
want to do. I want to play because I love the game,'' said Smits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The feet have taken away the fun of playing basketball.''  
</P>
<P>
	Smits had surgery to repair nerve damage in both of his feet in  
September 1996, but never completely recovered. He missed 30 games 
in the 1996-97 season and nine games in the 1997-98 season because 
of foot-related problems. He had a special trainer work on the feet 
several times this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is making it difficult just playing the way I am,'' he  
said. ``I can play with the pain as long as I still feel 
productive, able to help the team. This year, I felt a lot of my 
productivity was out on the floor, away from the basket. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was shooting a lot of jumpers. My post game, which I always  
felt was my strength, really suffered. ... I was really off balance 
down there. I didn't have a lot of explosiveness. I had to fade 
away from the basket because I didn't have the strength, the 
comfort to go to the basket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smits played most of the playoffs with a fractured big toe on  
his left foot, an injury he suffered in the opening round against 
Milwaukee. He finished with an 11.8 scoring average for Indiana's 
13 playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers were eliminated in six games by New York in the  
Eastern Conference finals. Smits fouled out three times and his 
minutes were reduced sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Smits said the fractured toe helped ease concern over the  
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The foot felt better because it was numb,'' he said. ``It's  
probably the best I've felt all year, those games against the 
Knicks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before making a decision about retiring, Smits will consider  
taking steps aimed at improving his condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the feet will feel better. They always have felt better  
with some rest,'' Smits said. But ``if they start hurting again, 
I've got to go.''

<HEADLINE> Phil Collins Scores With Soundtrack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- When the call came asking him to work on the  
songs for Disney's animated ``Tarzan'' four years ago, Phil Collins 
was in an uncomfortable place in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	A hugely successful pop musician, he had just released ``Both  
Sides,'' an effort he considered ``my best record,'' but one the 
public didn't embrace, and ``I was asking myself: What is it about 
me that they like?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The answer, he decided, could be found in the past, with all  
those hits from his string of solo albums starting with ``Face 
Value'' in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess, subconsciously, there was a part of me that said: I  
am going to do this and prove something, building your own 
confidence up that you can do it,'' he said in a recent interview. 
``It was an opportunity to move out of that meat market of MTV and 
VH1 and do something that would be lasting and forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And with ``Tarzan,'' it was.  
</P>
<P>
	Now, with strong buzz surrounding both the movie and the  
soundtrack, Collins, 48, is hot again. His version of the song 
``You'll Be in My Heart'' is getting steady radio airplay, and his 
fan base -- which had been aging somewhat -- suddenly took a turn 
toward the young. 
</P>
<P>
	Like another middle-aged British pop star who went Disney --  
``Lion King'' songwriter Elton John -- Collins can now add 
7-year-olds to his list of admirers. The scat song Collins wrote, 
``Trashin' the Camp,'' is the kid-friendly ``Hakuna Matata'' of 
``Tarzan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's lovely,'' said Collins. ``As an artist, all you  
really want to do is communicate. The fact that these young kids 
are going to listen to the music and hopefully like it -- what else 
can a writer want? You sort of appeal to a whole different age 
group. That's a perfect thing, really.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins was initially brought into the ``Tarzan'' project as a  
songwriter. His background as a drummer for the rock group Genesis 
and on his solo projects particularly appealed to the filmmakers, 
who wanted a strong jungle beat to accompany Tarzan's adventures. 
</P>
<P>
	He jumped at the job. A father of three, the twice-married  
Collins has acted occasionally and done closing-credits songs for 
other movies, including the Academy Award-nominated ``Take a Look 
at Me Now'' from ``Against All Odds,'' but never worked on a full 
soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspired by Edgar Rice Burroughs' original story of the human  
raised by gorillas, ``Tarzan'' is a fast-moving animated tale that 
fashions the hero as a modern-day extreme games fanatic, who not 
only swings from vines but also swoops down twisting tree branches 
like a surfer. 
</P>
<P>
	From early on, directors Kevin Lima and Chris Buck didn't want  
to follow Disney musical tradition and have the hero burst into 
song. Instead, they turned to Collins to provide the singing voice, 
serving as an emotional narrator. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a departure for us,'' said Thomas Schumacher, president  
of Walt Disney Feature Animation. ``But I think it holds the movie 
together and gives it a real drive and a real energy and a real 
focus. It's fresh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For his first soundtrack, Collins said he read the original  
Burroughs material and took notes. He got a rough outline of the 
movie, then started writing almost immediately, coming up with 
material in a couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had lots of things to play them -- among them four of the  
songs that ended up in the movie,'' he said. Lyrics were added 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	The songs went through a variety of twists and turns before  
Collins and composer Mark Mancina emerged with a finished 
soundtrack featuring five Collins songs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The drumbeats had to be both scary and arresting and  
exciting,'' said Collins, who looked to African tribal rhythms. ``I 
had some rhythms that would have sent the kids screaming out of the 
theater. We decided that was not the best thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Collins recorded his own versions of some of the  
songs, which are on the soundtrack along with Mancina's score. 
Besides English, Collins recorded the soundtrack's songs in French, 
German, Italian and two Spanish dialects for international markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, for the first time, Collins -- never a favorite of rock  
critics -- feels he's about to enter a new stage in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an exciting thing,'' he said. ``This is the point where  
I'm getting all kinds of interesting feedback about people's 
feelings after they see it. I've never had so much good things said 
about something I've been involved in.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Uses Gore's Words Against Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans pounced on what they called  
``flip-flopping'' in Al Gore's presidential announcement speech, 
accusing him of changing positions on gun control and other issues 
during his 22 years in elected office. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee,  
said Gore was tailoring his ``convictions to meet the fashions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a full page ad Wednesday in several newspapers, including The  
Des Moines Register and USA Today, Nicholson asked Gore to clarify 
what he said were inconsistencies in the vice president's record. 
</P>
<P>
	``The months ahead offer you a chance to finally explain  
yourself,'' Nicholson wrote. ``This can be a real opportunity for 
you to level with the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The RNC also distributed research that it said showed  
inconsistencies in Gore's record, citing his votes on gun control 
while in Congress and his speech formally announcing his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``While some want to pass new protections for gun manufacturers,  
to shield them from lawsuits, I will work to get guns off the 
streets, out of the schools, and away from children and 
criminals,'' the vice president said in Carthage, Tenn., on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans countered that Gore, as a member of Congress, voted:  
</P>
<P>
	--Against a 14-day waiting period for handgun purchases in 1985,  
but then in favor of a seven-day waiting period in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	--Against gun dealer licensing and inspection requirements in  
1985. 
</P>
<P>
	--Against requiring serial numbers on all handguns manufactured  
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	--Against retaining the ban on the interstate sale of handguns in  
1985. 
</P>
<P>
	The RNC also accused him of flip-flopping on a semiautomatic  
weapons ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the vice president has been very consistent on all  
these issues,'' responded Gore's spokesman Roger Salazar. ``It's a 
shame the Republicans can't offer any positive visions but can only 
attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential  
front-runner, has been criticized for failing to clearly articulate 
his stand on gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has no immediate response to Gore's announcement speech.  
</P>
<P>
	But Elizabeth Dole said she welcomed Gore to the campaign, while  
questioning his references to ``moral authority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Where was Al Gore when his partner, Bill Clinton, robbed the  
Oval Office of its moral authority?'' Dole said. ``I think the time 
has come for the sun to set on the Clinton-Gore administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Nashville, Tenn., another GOP hopeful, Gary Bauer, said Al  
Gore was right to stress the ``crisis in the American family.'' But 
he said Clinton administration policies have robbed Gore of his 
credibility on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that it doesn't pass the straight-face test for the  
vice president to start talking about faith-based solutions and 
family values when all of the judges he and the president have put 
on the court have been very radical,'' said Bauer, who is on leave 
from the conservative Family Research Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes said he and Gore do not agree on many policy  
questions, but that dichotomy will be a welcome change in the 
campaign. He wants to debate Gore on issues from social security to 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that his fundamentally different views are going to  
make the campaign about something more than personalities,'' Forbes 
said in an interview.

<HEADLINE> Chimpanzees Said To Have 'Culture' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some chimpanzees greedily slurp ants off a stick as if it were a  
wriggling lollipop, while others daintily pluck them, one by one. 
</P>
<P>
	Some chimps mop their brows with leaves; others demurely raise  
their arms while companions groom them. 
</P>
<P>
	Some researchers now agree that the variety of behavior  
exhibited by mankind's closest relative can be summed up in a 
single word: culture. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first time scientists have concluded that a species  
other than humans has a culture, or a way of life based on customs 
that are learned and shared rather than genetically programmed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence is overwhelming that chimpanzees have a  
remarkable ability to invent new customs and technologies, and they 
pass these on socially,'' said primatologist Frans de Waal of Emory 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, conducted by primatologist Andrew Whiten of the  
University of St. Andrews in Scotland and others, was published 
Thursday in the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings are based on an analysis of chimp data spanning  
five decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Jane Goodall, the world-renowned scientists who has been  
observing primates at Gombe Stream in Tanzania since 1960 in the 
longest-running animal behavior project, co-wrote the study. 
</P>
<P>
	The research found at least 39 customs related to chimps' tool  
use, grooming and courtship. The customs vary widely from group to 
group, much as they do in humans. The scientists said it is too 
early to tell if some chimp cultures are more advanced than others. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we see in wild chimps, on a lesser scale, is the sort of  
cultural diversity that we would see in traditional human 
societies,'' said primatologist Craig Stanford of the University of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	Some anthropologists disagree, saying the primate researchers  
had redefined culture in order to include chimps. The customs 
practiced by a human culture are more than a collection of 
behaviors, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their claim for chimps depends on an operational definition  
that is quite unlike that used by cultural anthropologists,'' said 
Daniel Segal of Stanford University, editor of the journal Cultural 
Anthropology. 
</P>
<P>
	Chimps and ancestral humans split on the evolutionary tree more  
than 4 million years ago, but the ape's genetic code still overlaps 
ours by more than 98 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Primatologists generally consider chimps to be as mentally  
capable as a 4-year-old child, and they share many practices with 
primitive human cultures, including social bonds, certain hunting 
habits and the use of plants for medicinal purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Many animal species learn fundamental survival skills from their  
parents, and their habits differ depending on where they live. 
Songbirds, for example, learn local dialects of their species' 
song. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolphins swim in groups and have a complex communications  
system, while elephants display a range of emotions, including 
grief. 
</P>
<P>
	But the extensive types of behavior among chimps are  
unparalleled and are not necessarily dictated by particular 
boundaries or environments. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tanzania, chimps at Gombe routinely use sticks to probe the  
ground for termites, but chimps 100 miles away in the Mahale 
Mountains do not. 
</P>
<P>
	Gombe chimps don't use stones to crack nuts, even though their  
terrain is strewn with rocks. But Tai rainforest chimps in the 
Ivory Coast use stone tools even though rocks are scarce. 
</P>
<P>
	At Tai, grooming chimps wipe parasites on their forearms before  
mashing them with their forefingers. At Gombe, groomers mash 
parasites on a leaf. 
</P>
<P>
	What remains unresolved is the origins' of chimp customs and  
precisely how they are shared. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just now beginning to videotape families to see how they  
acquire these behaviors,'' said Ann Pusey of the University of 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings raise an important new consideration in the  
conservation of chimpanzees' rapidly dwindling populations across 
Africa. Logging, hunting and farming have reduced the chimp 
population to less than 200,000, down from the millions of 
chimpanzees 100 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not just losing chimpanzees,'' Whiten said. ``We are  
losing the diversity of chimpanzee cultures.''

<HEADLINE> Coke Traces Problems in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Coca-Cola Co. blames substandard gas  
used to put fizz into drinks at a bottling plant in Belgium and a 
pesticide on wooden crates at a plant in France for a health scare 
that led three European nations to ban distribution of the soft 
drink company's brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the hospitalization of dozens of Belgian youngsters  
suffering from nausea, Coke said late Tuesday it found separate 
problems at two plants supplying the Belgian market, but denied 
there was any contamination of its drinks. 
</P>
<P>
	The governments in Belgium and Luxembourg have banned all sales  
of Coke and other Coca-Cola brands such as Diet Coke, Sprite, 
Bonaqua and Minute Maid fruit juices. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Tuesday, the French government announced it had banned sale  
of cans of Coke brands, saying the company's explanations weren't 
deemed sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a precautionary measure,'' Marylise Lebranchu, secretary  
of state at France's Finance Ministry, was quoted as saying in an 
interview published today in the Le Parisien daily. ``We can't take 
any risks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as we don't know the exact origin of the intoxication,  
it's better that we proceed with a general ban.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coke's Dutch arm has also ordered its distributors in the  
Netherlands to stop any imports of Coca-Cola products from Belgian 
suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union said it was leaving up to individual EU  
member governments to handle the situation and said it had no 
evidence the problem had spread beyond those nations that had 
already taken measures. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said an independent analysis found nothing toxic in  
its products. It said the problem with the gas produced only an off 
taste and the pesticide affected the outside bottom of the cans, 
giving off an ``offensive odor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philippe Lenfant, general manager of Coca-Cola Belgium, said gas  
used to put the fizz into drinks at a bottling plant in the 
northern city of Antwerp was substandard, while a pesticide used to 
treat wooden crates had infected the underside of Coke cans at a 
plant in the French port of Dunkirk, just across the Belgian 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke said it hoped the identification of the problem and recall  
of drinks from the two plants, would lead to the Belgian government 
lifting its blanket ban on all sales of Coke brands. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released by the company's headquarters in  
Atlanta, Coca-Cola said it was working closely with the Belgian 
Health Ministry to assure the safety and quality of products in 
Belgium and ``to obtain final clearance for sale of the products in 
the Belgian market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coke officials in Belgium said the company had ordered further  
tests it hoped would clear all products not identified as causing 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's statement insisted the problems were confined to  
the Belgian market and ``do not relate to products produced in 
other parts of the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belgian Health Minister Luc Van den Bossche banned all Coke  
products Monday after almost 50 people were hospitalized with 
nausea after drinking Coke products. 
</P>
<P>
	The scare came as Belgium was reeling from a scandal over food  
infected with cancer-causing dioxin, which led to bans on chickens, 
pork, beef, eggs and butter. 
</P>
<P>
	After pinning the blame on one animal food plant, the Belgian  
government authorized stores to resume sales Friday of products 
from farms deemed safe, but bans on Belgian foods remain in effect 
in a number of other countries.

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The company that owns the San Francisco  
Chronicle on Wednesday authorized its investment firm to explore 
the sale of all or part of its holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	Chronicle Publishing Co.'s board of directors voted unanimously  
to proceed with formal exploration of the company's sale. 
</P>
<P>
	New York investment firm Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette will  
evaluate all potential buyers and transactions, a process that is 
expected to take several months. 
</P>
<P>
	Chronicle chief executive John B. Sias did not immediately  
return a telephone call from The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Chronicle Publishing spokesman Don Solem said there has been  
``great interest'' in the company since the investment firm was 
hired last month. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the board has ``been surprised by the robust market and  
the high level of interest in Chronicle Publishing Co., so this is 
definitely a big step forward in the direction of sale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A timeline for selling the company would depend on the market  
and the number of offers, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Chronicle Publishing is privately held. It owns the Chronicle,  
the Bloomington Pantagraph in Illinois and the Worcester Telegram &AMP; 
Gazette in Massachusetts. It owns television stations KRON in San 
Francisco; KAKE in Wichita, Kan.; and WOWT in Omaha, Neb. Its 
holdings also include a Web site and two book publishing companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The company more than likely would be sold in pieces rather than  
its entirety, Solem said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chronicle and its rival, the San Francisco Examiner, have  
long been the subject of rumors that have one paper buying out the 
other or the two papers merging. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst Corp., which owns the Examiner, has said it has the right  
of first refusal to buy the Chronicle under an agreement between 
the two privately held firms.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Wants Java Restriction Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. asked a federal appeals  
court Wednesday to lift a judge's restrictions on shipments of 
software containing Java programming language, saying the judge 
inflated a contract dispute with Sun Microsystems Inc. into a 
copyright infringement. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1996 licensing deal between the companies was ``an agreement  
between two equal parties, Sun and Microsoft, to share and 
distribute technology,'' Barbara Caulfield, a lawyer for Microsoft, 
told the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	If Microsoft violated the terms, Sun could seek damages for  
breach of contract but should be required to show it was being 
harmed before getting an injunction against distribution of 
Microsoft products, Caulfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, she said, U.S. District Judge Ronald Whyte treated the  
alleged violations as infringements of Sun's copyright and issued 
the injunction last November without requiring Sun to show harm 
from Microsoft sales. The law presumes that a copyright-holder was 
harmed by an infringement. 
</P>
<P>
	The injunction prohibits Microsoft from distributing any  
products that use Sun's Java copyrights, including Windows 98 and 
Internet Explorer 4.0, unless Microsoft conforms to Sun's standards 
for Java. 
</P>
<P>
	Whyte clarified his ruling in February to allow Microsoft to  
develop and distribute its own version of Java as long as it didn't 
violate Sun's copyright. 
</P>
<P>
	Java, introduced by Sun in 1995, allows developers to write a  
software application once and have it run on a variety of 
computers, regardless of the underlying system. Sun, based in Palo 
Alto, Calif., has tried to promote its form of Java as a universal 
programming language. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun's lawsuit says Microsoft used its licensed version of Java  
to design a Windows-only version that was incompatible with other 
software, in violation of the licensing agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Microsoft was required to make sure a commercial product  
passed the compatibility test before it was sold to the public,'' 
Rusty Day, a lawyer for Sun, told the three-judge panel. He said 
Microsoft violated Sun's copyright by using Java without abiding by 
the licensing restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	A ruling in Microsoft's favor would require Whyte to reconsider  
the injunction. 
</P>
<P>
	The injunction remains in effect until the court rules, though  
when that will be is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	Whyte is scheduled to hear arguments June 25 on Sun's request  
for a finding of copyright infringement without a trial. His 
injunction was based on a finding that Sun was likely to prove 
infringement.

<HEADLINE> Hitchcock Faces Game-Time Decisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Stars may regain some of the scoring  
punch they've been missing as injured forwards Brett Hull and 
Benoit Hogue are close to returning for Game 5 of the Stanley Cup 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Ken Hitchcock said Wednesday he won't decide whether to  
use either player until just before Thursday night's game against 
the Buffalo Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
	Hull has been out since aggravating a groin injury in the early  
minutes of Game 3. Hogue hasn't played since tearing ligaments in 
his left knee in Game 2 of the Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be nice to have those guys involved and part of us  
right now,'' center Mike Modano said. ``But we want them to be 100 
percent effective and able to play their game the way they want to 
play it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Modano would know. He's playing with a cast covering a broken  
bone in his left wrist suffered in Game 2. Although a hard cast 
limits his stickhandling ability, he made a nice pass for the 
assist on Dallas' only goal in a 2-1 loss Tuesday night that tied 
the series at two games each. 
</P>
<P>
	Hogue, who has been saying he's ready for several days, proved  
it by going through contact drills Wednesday. He'll go through 
another workout Thursday morning, then the pregame skate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctor checked it in Buffalo and said he was amazed at how  
it had healed and how strong it is,'' Hogue said. ``I'm not looking 
at playing 82 games on it, just three.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hull skated for 30 minutes Wednesday. If he feels OK Thursday  
morning, he'll get hit during that workout. Then, the pregame skate 
will be the clincher. 
</P>
<P>
	``It now looks like he's a player in this series in the next  
couple of games,'' Hitchcock said. ``The test he passed today was 
good. If he passes the next test, that moves him into the probable 
category.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The risk Hitchcock faces if he goes with Hull and Hogue is  
hoping that less than 100 percent from them is better than the 
Stars would get from the healthy players he benches. 
</P>
<P>
	The reward, however, could be an offensive spark for a team that  
has scored three goals on its last 60 shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Hogue partially tore his medial collateral ligament and  
completely ripped his ACL on May 24. He immediately decided to 
delay surgery in hopes of playing in the first Stanley Cup finals 
of his 12-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made a big decision and everyone respected that,'' forward  
Guy Carbonneau said. ``It'll definitely give us a push if he's in 
the lineup. He's strong mentally, strong in the corners and he can 
score goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hogue tied for the team lead in goals and game-winners last  
postseason, then signed with Tampa Bay as a free agent. The Stars 
re-acquired him at the trading deadline for some added offensive 
depth and he provided two assists in 12 playoff games before the 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's saying the future is now,'' Hitchcock said. ``I  
think he's willing to take that chance for a shot at the prize and 
I admire him for it.''

<HEADLINE> Ickes Is Hillary's Campaign Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton's identification with  
Eleanor Roosevelt has taken on a new dimension in her choice of top 
campaign adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	Harold M. Ickes enjoys an even closer communion with the  
Roosevelt years -- his father was FDR's hard-charging interior 
secretary and, in many ways, his enforcer. 
</P>
<P>
	Like father, like son.  
</P>
<P>
	The son, loyal, combative and at times perhaps a little over the  
edge, is devoting his energies to getting the first lady into the 
Senate. His father had tried to persuade Franklin Roosevelt's wife 
to take the same course but she declined. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising from the caldron of the '60s civil rights movement and  
the liberal politics of Manhattan's West Side, Ickes became a 
player in the Clinton White House. He was promoter of the failed 
health care reforms, top operative for the 1996 reelection campaign 
and now finds himself as Mrs. Clinton's lieutenant in New York's 
unforgiving political wars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think anyone who has Harold on their side has an oak tree  
standing next to them,'' said former New York City Mayor Edward 
Koch, who lost an Ickes-directed 1989 Democratic mayoral primary to 
David Dinkins. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Dinkins says Ickes ``has a good head and a good  
heart,'' but adds, ``Just don't make an enemy of him. ... He has 
been known to express himself in a severe fashion on occasion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York City public relations executive James Vlasto can attest  
to that. 
</P>
<P>
	He was working with Ickes on a 1973 mayoral campaign when Ickes  
got into a knockdown fight with the campaign manager. ``I tried to 
break it up,'' Vlasto said, but Ickes bit him. ``It was not a soft 
bite, either.'' Vlasto said he poured some vodka on the wound and 
drank the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The episode added to an already growing legend surrounding  
Ickes, a man who had lost a kidney because of a 1965 beating by a 
gang of white men in Louisiana while he helped register blacks to 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	While conceding he does have a temper, Ickes said ``it's become  
mythological and blown out of proportion. Sometimes I use the 
temper for effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Morris, former consultant to President Clinton, recalled  
some rough times with Ickes, now 59, during the 1996 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to move him to the center and he wanted to move him  
to the left,'' Morris recalled. ``We nearly killed each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Ickes calls such talk simplistic, noting his work on behalf of  
the centrist Clinton in 1992 and his earlier efforts in the failed 
presidential campaign of Edmund Muskie. ``Ed Muskie was hardly your 
West Side liberal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Ickes had a history of working for losing Democratic  
presidential candidates -- from Eugene McCarthy to Jesse Jackson -- 
before hooking up with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The two had met in the early 1970s while working against the  
Vietnam War. In 1992, Ickes ran Clinton's successful New York 
primary campaign and his activities at the Democratic National 
Convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Clinton's victory, Ickes appeared to be in line for a  
top White House post. Those plans were derailed by questions over 
his law firm's representation of a union suspected of having ties 
with organized crime. An investigation found no misconduct by him 
or the firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Brought in to sell Mrs. Clinton's health reforms to Congress and  
the public, Ickes lost that fight but his bond with the first lady 
was cemented. 
</P>
<P>
	Ickes' subsequent involvement in the Clinton's Whitewater  
response team and his work as strategist and fund-raiser in the 
1996 campaign left him with a stack of subpoenas and legal bills. 
Earlier this year, Attorney General Janet Reno rejected an 
independent counsel investigation of Ickes for allegedly lying to a 
Senate committee investigating campaign finances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get the feeling his heart is really in public service; it  
would have to be to go through all he's gone through in recent 
years and still be willing to be involved,'' former New York Gov. 
Mario Cuomo said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Clinton's reelection, Ickes read in a newspaper that he  
was on his way out of the White House. After directing the 
president's second inaugural, he started a Washington-based 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	A generation before Ickes took that awful gang beating and  
managed the campaign of New York's only black mayor, Dinkins, his 
father had decreed in 1939 that the Lincoln Memorial would be made 
available to a concert by Marion Anderson, the black singer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daughters of the American Revolution had refused to allow  
her to perform in Constitution Hall, prompting Mrs. Roosevelt to 
resign from the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-five when his son was born that same year, the elder Ickes  
died when the boy was just 12. ``I hardly knew him,'' the son said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think both Harold and Hillary have ghosts looking over their  
shoulders,'' Morris said. ``In Harold's case, it's his father. In 
Hillary's case, it's Eleanor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of parallels in our lives,'' Ickes agreed.  
``It really is amazing. But at the time I wasn't conscious of it. 
Probably some of it was by osmosis.''

<HEADLINE> Refugees Stream Back Into Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Ignoring warnings from NATO and the  
dangers of minefields, ethnic Albanian refugees streamed into 
Kosovo today, encouraged by the mostly successful allied 
peacekeeping mission. Serbs in fear of retaliation frantically 
packed the Pristina bus station. 
</P>
<P>
	Roads leading north out of Kosovo were crammed with Serbs --  
either Yugoslav soldiers departing under terms of the peace deal 
that ended the 78-day NATO air campaign or Serb civilians 
frightened of Kosovo rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	The state-run Tanjug news agency reported that all Yugoslav army  
units had left Pristina, Kosovo's provincial capital, saying 
peacekeepers helped escort some of the final 50 vehicles out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav withdrawal from the zone extending from Pristina to  
Kosovo's southern border was largely completed by its midnight 
Tuesday deadline, except for isolated cases of broken-down 
vehicles, a NATO spokesman, Maj. Lewis Garneau, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO gave the Serbs an additional 24 hours to vacate that zone  
due to road congestion, saying the Serbs were ``making a serious 
effort'' to comply with the timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the peace deal, all 40,000 Serb forces are to be out of  
Kosovo by Sunday night; NATO said today that 26,000 of the forces 
have left. 
</P>
<P>
	At Morini on the Albanian border, refugees poured across the  
border today, creating miles-long backups of cars, tractors, buses 
and vans. Many honked their horns and made victory signs. 
Overwhelmed Albanian border guards made only cursory checks of 
those crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said 10,000 refugees returned Tuesday from Albania --  
some 440,000 fled there beginning in March -- and thousands entered 
Kosovo from Macedonia. Far more were expected to leave today, said 
Judith Kumin, spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once this thing gathers momentum there's a snowball effect and  
you can't stop it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Refugees were returning despite warnings that they would find  
scorched villages, minefields and little food in their Kosovo 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	UNHCR set up way stations on the road between the Albanian  
border town of Kukes and the Kosovo city of Prizren to supply 
people with food and water during their return, and UNHCR vehicles 
with tow ropes were on standby to help cars that broke down along 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are now in God's hands,'' said Ursim Gashi, a 26-year-old  
farmer on a tractor pulling a trailer jammed with relatives. 
``We'll be so happy to be back in our homeland we won't even need 
to eat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, meanwhile, announced it sent a third military convoy  
into Kosovo today from Bosnia even as Moscow said it wanted to 
solve a dispute with NATO over the peacekeeping operations. 
</P>
<P>
	A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman said the nine-vehicle  
convoy was carrying supplies for the 200-300 Russian troops that 
have occupied Pristina's airport since Saturday, coming in 
unexpectedly just before NATO forces entered Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO said today it was not aware of a third convoy.  
</P>
<P>
	A Russian convoy carrying food and fuel arrived Tuesday, raising  
tensions with NATO, which insists on commanding all peacekeeping 
operations in Kosovo through the five geographic sectors allocated 
to the United States and four other Western allies. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen met his Russian  
counterpart, Igor Sergeyev, in Helsinki, Finland, to discuss the 
issue today. 
</P>
<P>
	Jakup Krasniqi, a spokesman for the KLA rebels, accused the  
Russians of causing too many problems: ``The Russian troops that 
are not under the NATO command ... and without the permission of 
the U.N. will be unwelcome here, and we will treat them as enemy 
forces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American contingent in Kosovo rose to more than 3,000  
soldiers, along with 5,000 British and Canadian forces, 4,000 
German and Dutch troops, 2,000 Italians and 1,500 French. 
Peacekeeping forces aiding in the refugee cause are to total nearly 
50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Although most of the refugees appeared to come from around the  
Kosovo border town of Prizren, today's dash home could signal the 
start of what U.N. officials describe as the ``nightmarish, 
worst-case scenario.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The returns are a sea change in the makeup of the southern Serb  
province, after months of violence and widespread reports of 
atrocities and massacres forced 860,000 of Kosovo's 2.1 million 
prewar populace to flee their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dismayed by the Serb exodus and destruction of the country in  
the allied air campaign, the influential Serbian Orthodox Church 
urged President Slobodan Milosevic to resign Tuesday ``in the 
interest of the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees returned to Kosovo despite warnings that the  
province was still perilous, that aid workers cannot feed them and 
that NATO soldiers are not yet ready to protect them. Two refugees 
have died in blasts while crossing minefields. 
</P>
<P>
	As the refugees made their way home, signs of the war that began  
February 1998 with a crackdown by Milosevic's forces were 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	France's Defense Ministry said today that villagers in Vlastica,  
southeast of Pristina, told soldiers about a grave containing the 
bodies of 13 people killed on April 30. A French soldier saw bones 
appearing to be human under the ruins of a house, the ministry said 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday near Djakovica in southwest Kosovo, a corpse's hand  
reached skyward out of a grave that residents said could hold 150 
victims. Twenty charred bodies were found in a house in a nearby 
village. Residents of a village outside Pristina said they buried 
30 locals killed by Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb soldiers toting gas cans prowled an area outside Pristina  
on Tuesday, setting homes ablaze. Hours later, the road was filled 
with hundreds of tanks and armored vehicles driving toward Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The withdrawal from Kosovo is a severe blow to Serbian pride.  
Although Kosovo's population was only 10 percent Serb, the province 
is the symbolic heartland of Serbia, full of historic sites and 
holy buildings.

<HEADLINE>  Rosa Parks Honored by Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rosa Parks, a black woman whose refusal to  
give up her bus seat to a white man turned her into a symbol of the 
civil-rights struggle, has received Congress' highest honor: the 
Congressional Gold Medal. 
</P>
<P>
	At a ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda, Mrs. Parks, 86, was lauded  
Tuesday by President Clinton and leaders of the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank you,'' she said in a low, halting voice, adding that  
she accepted the award for a ``free people'' and for civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank you for what you have done,'' Clinton told Mrs. Parks.  
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 1, 1955, the seamstress, tired after a day's work in  
Montgomery, Ala., refused to give up her seat on a segregated city 
bus and was arrested for her defiance. 
</P>
<P>
	Her arrest set off a lengthy bus boycott by thousands of blacks  
-- led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., then a local minister. 
The boycott lasted about a year until the Supreme Court declared 
Montgomery's bus segregation law unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is the mother of the civil rights movement,'' said Rep.  
Julia Carson, D-Ind., who pushed for the legislation granting the 
Congressional Gold Medal to Mrs. Parks, who now lives in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a celebration of the life of Rosa Parks, who is  
receiving the honor while she can still see it,'' Carson said of 
Mrs. Parks, who appeared frail and had to be helped to her feet 
from her wheelchair, sometimes steadying herself on the arm of 
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank God that when your time came, you were not afraid,''  
House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said at the 
ceremony. ``You had courage, and you sat down for all of America 
and all of America's freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers gave Mrs. Parks an artist's drawing of the medal,  
which is not yet finished. 
</P>
<P>
	``She sat, anchored to that seat, as Dr. King said, by the  
accumulated indignities of days gone by and the countless 
aspirations of generations yet unborn,'' Clinton said. ``Rosa Parks 
said, `I didn't get on that bus to get arrested; I got on that bus 
to go home.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he was only 9 when Mrs. Parks refused to  
stand up. He and his friends ``couldn't figure out anything we 
could do since we couldn't even vote. So we began to sit on the 
back of the bus when we got on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Parks action cost her the seamstress job and prompted  
harassment and threats to her family. So she moved to Detroit in 
1957. She joined the staff of Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., in 1965 
and worked there until retiring in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, Mrs. Parks co-founded a nonprofit group, the Rosa and  
Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development, to help young people 
in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	The first Gold Medal was given to George Washington in 1776 for  
``wise and spirited conduct'' during the Revolutionary War. Recent 
honorees include evangelist Billy Graham, Frank Sinatra, Mother 
Teresa and Nelson Mandela.

<HEADLINE> Love In Search of First US Open Win  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- In a depression surrounding the 15th  
green at Pinehurst No. 2, Davis Love III learned how to chip. Just 
off the 16th fairway he mastered the art of fading an iron around 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Those kind of childhood memories of golf under the towering  
North Carolina pines will always be special for Love. 
</P>
<P>
	Creating some new memories in the U.S. Open would only make them  
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was always my favorite place to come,'' Love said  
Wednesday. ``This is a special U.S. Open and a special place. I 
think anybody that's been here is thrilled to be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first U.S. Open ever held at Pinehurst brings Love back to a  
place where he would come with his father, a golf instructor, as he 
was growing up. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a place where Love played while in college, and a place  
where he won the long driving contest on the 14th hole three years 
in a row in the North/South tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	It would figure to be a place where Love might have an advantage  
of sorts as he tries to win his first U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	But he insists that's not the case.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody has an advantage when it's set up for the U.S. Open,''  
Love said Wednesday. ``And I don't think sentiment is going to save 
you any strokes or knowledge of the golf course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dinners at the Pinecrest Inn and time with friends at the  
Carolina Hotel this week have revived pleasant memories of long ago 
times for Love, whose father brought him here from the age of 10 
while he taught at Golf Digest schools. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, it's been a fine week. That could easily change once  
play gets under way Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you start playing, you better start hitting the fairways  
and the greens or sentiment is not going to help you very much,'' 
Love said. 
</P>
<P>
	Love never actually played the No. 2 course at Pinehurst much  
when he was here. He mostly played the No. 4 course, but did get 
out and play 15, 16 and 17 many times because it was around the 
driving range. 
</P>
<P>
	It was there that instructor Jack Lumpkin taught him how to get  
the ball up from a deep greenside depression and how to hit the 
fade that has served him so well as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
	That Pinehurst was a different course than the one the players  
will face this week, however. The greens have been rebuilt with 
even steeper slopes around the edges, and the United States Golf 
Association always grows the rough deeper and narrows the fairways 
more for an Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time I knew the golf course very well,'' Love said.  
``But now the U.S. Open levels the playing field, turns it into 
more of a patience test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patience means hitting the ball in the fairway and setting up  
the proper shot to hold the unusual domed greens that tend to 
funnel mis-hit shots into shaved collection areas where making par 
is difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitting fairways is one thing Love has been doing well this  
year, in a season that has seen him finish in the top 10 in nine of 
his 14 tournaments. He's 35th on the PGA Tour in driving accuracy 
and 21st in distance, just the things needed on a long, tight U.S. 
Open course. 
</P>
<P>
	``With my length being an advantage, this golf course is set up  
for my game,'' Love said. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing Love hasn't done this year is win, although he  
finished second to Jose Maria Olazabal at the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal never really gave him a chance to win the Masters,  
unlike the 1996 Open, where Love would have been in a playoff with 
Steve Jones had he not 3-putted from 20 feet on the last hole. That 
miss still seems to haunt Love. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, I would have liked to have won more, but all I can do is  
try to win this one right now,'' Love said. ``I've gotten to the 
point where I feel like I have the game to win, but it's going out 
and beating the other 50 guys that have the game to win.''

<HEADLINE> New Rules Hurt Turin Olympics Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TURIN, Italy (AP) -- Turin's bidders hope the last will be first.  
</P>
<P>
	They go before the International Olympic Committee on Saturday,  
trying to land the 2006 Winter Games. But they will be the last of 
the six groups -- all from Europe -- to make a final presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	``After hours of presentations, we will have to be very concise  
and convincing to come in first, as winners of the IOC vote,'' says 
Evelina Cristillin, executive president of Associazione Torino 
2006. 
</P>
<P>
	Cristillin conceded that Sion, the Swiss town bidding for the  
third time after consecutive failures, seemed to have an edge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being from a country hosting IOC means something. Thus we  
started the run well below Sion,'' Cristillin said. ``But now we 
have the feeling that our chances are growing. We believe it's a 
50-50 percent chance. It's a feeling we got from Italian members of 
IOC, as we had no contacts at all with others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cristillin said she would not underestimate bids by Klagenfurt,  
Austria, and Helsinki, Finland. Bids by Zakopane, Poland, and 
Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia, appeared weak. 
</P>
<P>
	In rule changes sparked by the Salt Lake City bribery scandal,  
bidders could no longer play host to IOC members or visit them. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Italian officials had to limit their lobbying to  
video cassettes, brochures and news releases. 
</P>
<P>
	Sion had been visited by IOC members during its bid for 2002,  
eventually awarded to Salt Lake City. The Swiss city had also 
failed in its bid for the 1976 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Cristillin suggested that the vote for the 2006 bid could be  
part of the IOC's power struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	According to some reports, the IOC headquarters might be moved  
from Switzerland to Monte Carlo, which already is the home of track 
and field's governing body. 
</P>
<P>
	An industrial and cultural center in northwest Italy, Turin is  
the hometown of the Agnelli family and of their giant auto group 
FIAT. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of fashionable and well-organized winter resorts, such  
as Sestriere and Bardonecchia, are within 50 miles. Alpine ski 
courses are concentrated at Sestriere, which held skiing's world 
championships in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Bardonecchia is equipped for snowboard and Pragelato has venues  
for cross-country skiing. 
</P>
<P>
	If Turin is selected, organizers will have to build downtown  
stadiums for speedskating, ice hockey, curling and figure skating, 
a ski jumping hill in Pragelato and bobsled and luge tracks in 
Beaulard. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimated investment is $1 billion. About $10 million has  
been invested for the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agnelli family of auto tycoons, longtime lords of Turin and  
Sestriere whose interests span from real estate and construction to 
insurance and banking sectors, have been supporting the Turin bid 
discreetly. 
</P>
<P>
	But, as Cristillin put it, the great reputation of the Agnellis  
helped, although they were not directly involved in the executive 
process of the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Gianni Agnelli, Fiat's honorary chairman, was recently mentioned  
by IOC's president Juan Antonio Samaranch as one of the top 
international figures who might join the reorganized IOC executive 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Marco San Pietro, international relations director for the Turin  
bid, said the Italian side was penalized by rules changes enforced 
last year in the wake of the Salt Lake scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very difficult campaign because everything was  
practically forbidden,'' he said. ``It's impossible to go back to 
the old voting system, but the present one is not working either. 
Since so much money, especially for the Summer Games, is involved, 
the best way could be a secret bid as the ones for the industrial 
contracts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic champions Alberto Tomba and Stefania Belmondo will be in  
Seoul to support the Turin bid, intended to help the economic 
development of the region and boost tourism, which already reaches 
as high as 8 million visitors a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian officials noted the Turin Olympic village would be  
reconverted after the games while Sion plans to dismantle its 
village. 
</P>
<P>
	Cristillin said Turin will bid again for 2010, if it loses in  
Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't organize parties before the IOC meeting,'' she said.  
``But for sure we'll organize one after the vote, win or lose.''

<HEADLINE> Central Sprinkler OKs Tyco Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Central Sprinkler Corp. has agreed to be  
acquired by Bermuda-based Tyco International Ltd., for $115 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Wednesday will not affect the nationwide  
recall of 8.4 million of Central's Omega-brand sprinkler heads, 
Central Sprinkler chairman and chief executive E. Talbot Briddell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The contract between us contains a provision where they affirm  
the recall and their commitment to it, so the recall is in place,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyco offered $30 cash for each share of Central Sprinkler, which  
will operate as an independently managed Tyco subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	Central Sprinkler shares closed Wednesday at $28.18 3/4, up $5.81 1/4,  
or 26 percent, on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Tyco shares were up 
$2.37 1/2, at $91.31 1/4, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, expected to close in about three months, is  
subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyco, a diversified manufacturing and service company with  
operations in more than 80 countries, already owns Grinnell Corp., 
another major maker of fire sprinklers. Tyco also is a leading 
provider of security services and owns the ADT electronic security 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Lansdale, Pa.-based Central Sprinkler lost $23 million last  
year, including a $38 million charge to cover recall costs. It had 
1998 revenue of $125 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Omega sprinkler was a quick-response type that accounted for  
about 3 percent of Central Sprinkler's sales before being 
discontinued in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Used in apartments, homes, hospitals, hotels, schools, prisons  
and office buildings including the White House and U.S. Capitol, 
the sprinklers failed to activate in 17 fires since 1990, injuring 
at least four people and causing more than $4.3 million in property 
damage. The Omega heads also had high failure rates in laboratory 
tests.

<HEADLINE> Get Next Year's Garden Bulbs Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POUND RIDGE, N.Y. (AP) -- Just as spring bulbs are at their  
flowering zenith, catalogs rain down on us offering next year's 
bulbs. Talk about deja vu. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's method in the madness.  
</P>
<P>
	For what better time to decide what you need in bulbs than when  
your current efforts are on display? The daffodils you thought 
would carpet an area turned out thinly spaced. You'll need many 
more bulbs to create the desired effect. 
</P>
<P>
	And, also, do you want a uniform effect, a change of variety,  
some of both? The catalogs dazzle you with varieties. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, bulbs don't just mean crocuses, daffodils and tulips,  
the showiest of springtime. Their appearance is preceded by 
snowdrops in late winter. And there are other small bulbs with 
lovely colors, like chionodoxas. The summer brings lilies and 
gladioli while autumn is the season for colchicums. 
</P>
<P>
	Various catalogs offer attractive incentives for early orders.  
There are sales ending in August. There are order-now pay-later 
arrangements. There are bonuses for orders exceeding a certain 
price. 
</P>
<P>
	If you're new to gardening and not quite sure what bulbs are,  
they're plants that store food in swollen, bulb-like stems 
underground. Daffodils, tulips and lilies form what are called true 
bulbs, while crocuses and colchicums have somewhat similar 
structures called corms. Also tender bulbs can't take the cold and 
have to be dug and stored over winter while the hardy ones need the 
cold underground in which to hibernate. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Daffodil Society offers tips on purchasing bulbs  
that are applicable to all bulbs, not just daffodils: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Order early. This generally gets you the pick of the crop and  
also exactly what you want, without surprising substitutions. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Check the guarantee. Will you get a refund in case of  
problems? Are the bulbs guaranteed true to name? 
</P>
<P>
	-- Compare prices. Cheap bulbs could mean poor quality.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Discuss merchants with other gardeners to compare experiences.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Visit a flower show to scout varieties.  
</P>
<P>
	If you're shopping for bulbs in a nursery, rather than by  
catalog, you should check the offerings for firmness and weight. In 
the case of daffodils, tulips and lilies, look to see that the 
layers or scales are joined firmly. They shouldn't feel loose when 
you press them in your hand. The flesh of corms should be fairly 
hard. 
</P>
<P>
	In general, bulbs of inferior quality tend to be lighter in  
weight than the good ones. 
</P>
<P>
	A general rule for planting bulbs is to bury them three times as  
deep as the tallness of the bulb. But conditions aren't always that 
accommodating. The ground where you want to place a stand of 
daffodils may be tough and you can't go that deep. But I've found 
that nature isn't as demanding as the rule-makers and bulbs will 
often succeed even when shallowly planted. 
</P>
<P>
	To get a mass effect speedily with a daffodil bed, dig large  
holes and put six or more bulbs in each hole. Spacing them thinly, 
one bulb per hole six inches apart, means you'll have to wait a few 
years to get the mature effect produced by the bulbs spreading, if 
indeed you ever get it satisfactorily. 
</P>
<P>
	As much as bulbs in flower appeal to our eyes, bulbs underground  
appeal to the appetites of burrowing varmints. Particularly 
susceptible are tulips and lilies. 
</P>
<P>
	For protection, you can try making wire mesh holders for them.  
</P>
<P>
	In my part of the country, deer have been particularly  
destructive to tulips and lilies. But with steadfastness and 
determination you can protect your beds without taking the ultimate 
step of highly expensive fencing. 
</P>
<P>
	Spraying the foliage with a product called Deer-Off and at the  
same time spreading another product called Milorganite at soil 
level has worked on my beds. But it has to be done periodically, 
and unfailingly after a rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Daffodils are particularly beautiful blooming in masses on a  
large lawn, but if you want to keep that effect from year to year 
you have to sacrifice the looks of the lawn for a while after the 
blooming season. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't mow the area until the daffodil foliage turns yellow. That  
shows that the plant has replenished its food supplies and will be 
ready to give you that great show again next spring. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Plug Pulled on Divx DVDs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It was hailed as a replacement for video  
cassette rentals: Rent a movie for two days, then just toss out the 
video disk without having to return to the store. 
</P>
<P>
	But instead of the disks, it was the entire concept of  
single-use Divx that was junked Wednesday amid steep losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The death of Divx, a version of the digital video disk,  
underscored the risks of introducing a potentially sound product 
without support from key industry players. 
</P>
<P>
	The flop, in simple terms, was reminiscent of another high-tech  
battle in the 1970s, when Sony's Betamax VCR technology offered 
superior picture quality, yet lost to the rival VHS format that 
became an industry standard and a staple in America's homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The collaborators behind Divx, electronics retailer Circuit City  
and an entertainment law firm, said they were abandoning the 
venture because Hollywood studios didn't make enough movies for the 
format, and rental outlets wouldn't carry the single-use product. 
</P>
<P>
	The Divx venture, named Digital Video Express, will give a $100  
cash rebate to consumers who purchased Divx-enhanced players before 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In some ways, the Divx format offered new flexibility to movie  
watchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Like all DVDs, they look like audio CDs, but have greater  
storage capacity because they store information on both sides. They 
also offer superior movie images and sound to VHS tapes, and allow 
viewers to skip to any scene. 
</P>
<P>
	And unlike a video rental, where you pick up the tape the same  
day or the day before you plan to watch the film, Divx enabled 
people to buy a movie days or months before watching it for a price 
of $4.50. 
</P>
<P>
	However, once a disk is inserted into a Divx player, it will  
only work for 48 hours.To see the film again after the 48 hours 
have expired, a user has to pay an additional $3.25. 
</P>
<P>
	Obstacles like that may have contributed to the demise of Divx.  
</P>
<P>
	Renters also weren't able to pop Divx disks into a friend's  
machine or into a personal computer. That irked industry proponents 
of DVDs who promoted them as an ``open'' technology for PCs and DVD 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, Divx was mired in controversy from the start.  
</P>
<P>
	Launched in 1997, the Divx encryption technology required  
specially encoded disks and players that cost up to $100 more than 
conventional DVD players. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood studios were reluctant to release movies in both Divx  
and regular DVD format because they considered Divx a threat to 
their profitable rentals and sales of video tapes. 
</P>
<P>
	At least two studios, Columbia TriStar and Time Warner, didn't  
even sell movies in Divx, and most video rental outlets declined to 
carry them for much the same reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``Circuit City had hoped at some point they would begin to get  
support from Hollywood and suppliers of hardware -- that these two 
entities would start kicking in investments dollars -- And that 
never really took place,'' said Dale Ford, an analyst with the 
research firm Dataquest Corp.	   In addition, the new DVDs didn't work on existing DVD players 
that people had already bought and left would-be DVD users with a 
perplexing decision over which to buy. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the confusion may have slowed the overall consumer  
acceptance of DVD players, the much-hyped heir apparent to video 
cassette recorders. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, however, DVD players appear to be catching on as prices  
fall and word gets out about the crisper images and flexible 
viewing. Consumers can now buy a DVD player for less than $300, 
half as much as two years ago, although that still compares with 
prices as low as $80 for VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. sales of DVD players nearly quintupled to about 1 million  
units in the first five months of this year compared to the 
year-ago period, according to the Consumer Electronics 
Manufacturers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``without Divx confusion, it may have even been higher,''  
said Kevin Hause, an analyst with the International Data Corp. 
research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Hause and other analysts noted that Circuit City chose to devote  
much of its substantial marketing efforts to Divx instead of 
promoting general-use DVDs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Divx wasn't a total failure for its founders, Circuit City  
and the Los Angeles-based law firm Ziffren Brittenham Branca &AMP; 
Fischer. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit City, which sells 3 models of Divx players in its 585  
stores, said the machines captured up to one-quarter of its DVD 
player sales so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit City is setting aside $114 million, after taxes, to  
cover expenses related to closing down the business.

<HEADLINE> Baptists Rebuke Clinton on Gays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Southern Baptists overwhelmingly voted today to  
rebuke President Clinton for proclaiming June as Gay and Lesbian 
Pride Month and passed resolutions on issues ranging from human 
embryo research to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to allow the president, especially since he is  
a Southern Baptist, to say that homosexuality is good,'' said the 
Rev. Wiley Drake of Buena Park, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution also called on Clinton to rescind his appointment  
of James Hormel, who is gay, as ambassador to Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
	On the final day of a two-day annual convention, members of the  
nation's largest Protestant denomination also approved a resolution 
urging Congress, NATO and the United Nations to halt ``genocide and 
ethnic cleansing'' in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	They also voiced opposition to a study published by the American  
Psychological Association that concluded the long-term effects of 
child sexual abuse are not as serious as many believed, and called 
upon Congress to maintain the ban on the use of tax dollars for 
research that requires the destruction of human embryos. 
</P>
<P>
	On education, Southern Baptists encouraged members to support  
policies that allow religious instruction in public schools, and 
they commended public school employees who offer Christian 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Another motion asking that Clinton's home church, Immanuel  
Baptist Church in Little Rock, Ark., discipline him for supporting 
Gay and Lesbian Pride Month was ruled out of order Tuesday because 
it violated convention rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is ... a thorny situation,'' said the Rev. Paige  
Patterson, the president of the Southern Baptists, who was 
re-elected Tuesday to a second term. Immanuel Baptist Church 
members, he says, ``want on the one hand to be lovingly responsive 
to every member of the church. ... By the same token, I'm sure 
there must be many of them that are very troubled by it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Patterson and seminary president R. Albert Mohler Jr.  
urged Immanuel to discipline Clinton for his relationship with 
Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 16 million members of the denomination, an estimated  
11,000 are in Atlanta for the group's annual convention, which 
ended today. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Patterson asked members to recruit in inner cities  
and follow strict fundamentalist interpretation of the Scripture. 
</P>
<P>
	In the next decade, Southern Baptists hope to start one to four  
``flagship churches'' in 17 cities, said the Rev. Phil Roberts of 
the convention's North American Mission Board. Chicago, Phoenix, 
Las Vegas, Boston, Philadelphia and Seattle will be targeted over 
the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The emphasis on urban recruiting marks a dramatic shift for a  
denomination whose 16 million members live mostly in small towns, 
suburbs and rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The denomination was formed in 1845 by rural whites who insisted  
on their right to own slaves. During the civil rights era, blacks 
were not welcome in most Southern Baptist churches. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, though, the denomination has tried to reach out to  
blacks and has apologized for tolerating racism. It now has an 
estimated 2,800 churches with mostly black members, a fraction of 
the thousands of black Baptist churches. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. David K. Campbell of New Orleans appreciated  
Patterson's emphasis on evangelizing in urban areas but thought the 
minister's speech might not have gone far enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a heart for the cities,'' Campbell said. ``But I was  
hoping that he would talk about reaching out along racial lines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his call for more diversity in the church membership,  
Patterson made clear that he does not believe it should be 
accomplished with modern methods of preaching. He railed against 
pastors who replace the literal words of the Bible with creative 
interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twelve-minute sermonettes generated by the `felt needs' of an  
assembled cast of postmodern listeners augmented by drama and 
multiple repetitions of touchy-touchy, feely-feely music is the 
call of the hour,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Southern Baptists should be moved by the Bible.  
</P>
<P>
	``For most Baptists it is settled forever -- we believe every  
syllable of the word of God to be absolutely true,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Gas Surge Causes Mich. Home Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) -- A misplaced gauge likely caused a  
natural gas surge that sparked 18 fires in a neighborhood, 
significantly damaging at least eight homes. Two people were 
treated for smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
	A preliminary investigation by Semco Energy Gas Co. shows that  
Tuesday's surge in gas was caused by overpressurization. Because of 
a map inaccuracy, a gauge was not placed at the actual point at 
which workers made a connection, the utility said today. That 
caused high-pressure gas to go into a low-pressure line. 
</P>
<P>
	Lenn Thompkins was watching TV when her son noticed flames.  
</P>
<P>
	``He screamed, `Fire! Fire! The furnace is on fire!''' Ms.  
Thompkins said. ``We tried to call 911, but we couldn't get 
through. So I just said, `Get out!''' 
</P>
<P>
	The fire went out by itself a few minutes before firefighters  
showed up. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the inner workings and wiring are melted, and there are  
ashes everywhere,'' she said after the gas company and fire 
department had checked her home of 24 years and declared it safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Gas was shut off to about 1,500 homes, said David Allen, a Semco  
Energy spokesman. Authorities planned to go house to house to make 
sure no gas remained in the lines, and estimated it could take two 
to three days before service was resumed. The 20-block area was not 
evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
	The utility serves about 35,000 customers in Battle Creek and  
250,000 statewide.

<HEADLINE> Oldest Fossil of Beaked Bird Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Paleontologists reported today that they have found a fossil of  
the oldest known bird species with a beak -- an upturned bill 
resembling Woody Woodpecker's. 
</P>
<P>
	The 130 million-year-old, crow-sized Confuciusornis dui was  
discovered last year in lake sediment in China, so exquisitely 
preserved that impressions of its feathers are clearly visible. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, the earliest known toothless, beaked bird dated from  
about 70 million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The skull of the Confuciusornis dui fascinated -- and amused --  
scientists. The beak resembles that of pesky cartoon character 
Woody Woodpecker. 
</P>
<P>
	The creature's beak was an advanced trait for its time, coming  
only 10 million to 15 million years after the first known bird -- 
the toothy, reptile-like Archaeopteryx -- during the Jurassic 
Period. The Archaeopteryx had a reptilian snout rather than a beak 
of horn-like material. 
</P>
<P>
	The back end of the Confuciusornis dui's skull is primitive,  
with two openings behind the eyes that are a throwback to 
dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you've got is a modern car engine hood on the rear end of  
a Model T,'' said Larry Martin, curator of vertebrate paleontology 
at the University of Kansas' Museum of Natural History. He helped 
analyze the fossil. 
</P>
<P>
	This combination of primitive and advanced traits suggests that  
early bird evolution was more complex than previously thought and 
included many species that didn't succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is showing a diversity we didn't know about before. It's  
not like you have this sort of straight-line evolution from one to 
another and each one getting more specialized,'' said Storrs Olson, 
curator of birds at the National Museum of Natural History at the 
Smithsonian Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Sankar Chatterjee, a professor of geology at Texas Tech  
University, agreed: ``The story is much more complex. Evolution is 
not really like a ladder. It's more like a bush.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bird, described in today's issue of the journal Nature, was  
analyzed by American scientists and a team from the Chinese Academy 
of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists believe the bird flew well and took off by scaling  
trees and jumping. 
</P>
<P>
	Confuciusornis (kahn-FYOO-shus-OR-nis) dui is the smallest  
species found to date of the order named for the Chinese 
philosopher. The birds became extinct 120 million years ago and 
probably didn't lead to modern birds. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of specimens of a larger species of Confuciusornis have  
also been found at the site, but all lacked intact skulls. 
Researchers believe the birds fell victim to volcanic eruptions 
that preserved their remains.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Warning in Bermuda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) -- Cruise ships fled Bermuda on Wednesday  
in fear of Tropical Storm Arlene, despite predictions the storm 
would probably miss the islands on its crawl through the Atlantic 
Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	By late Wednesday, forecasters said Arlene was barely of  
tropical storm strength, with top sustained winds of 40 mph, down 
from 45 mph earlier Wednesday. Tropical storms have sustained winds 
of at least 39 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters predicted the storm would weaken and turn north  
Thursday, missing the British territory. But residents could expect 
wind and rain, they warned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bermuda Weather Service predicted the storm would be at its  
closest point to the islands -- 92 miles away -- at 1 a.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlene is the first storm of the Atlantic hurricane season.  
</P>
<P>
	At 8 p.m. EDT, it was centered about 130 miles east-southeast of  
Bermuda and was moving to the north-northwest at 5 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing it safe, Celebrity cruise line's Zenith Horizon sailed  
to Miami, and the Norwegian Crown and Norwegian Majesty were headed 
for home ports in New York and Boston to avoid the storm. The 
Nordic Empress, which was expected in Bermuda on Wednesday, sailed 
to the Bahamas instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlene's storm-force winds extended 105 miles from its center,  
down from 145 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the strongest winds  
would probably stay east of Bermuda. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardware stores were doing a brisk business in batteries and  
portable lights after the storm warning was issued Wednesday, as 
Bermudians prepared for possible power failures.

<HEADLINE> Irvin Denies He's Unhappy in Dallas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Michael Irvin denied Wednesday that he has  
demanded a contract extension or is unhappy with his role in the 
Dallas Cowboys' offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys don't know what you're talking about. You're always  
wrong when it comes to me,'' Irvin told reporters after 
participating in the team's morning workout. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspaper and broadcast reports have said for weeks that the  
33-year-old wide receiver is unhappy because owner Jerry Jones has 
not offered to extend his contract, which ends after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin, who has led the team in receiving the past eight seasons,  
also was reported to be upset about his lessened role in coach Chan 
Gailey's plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Read my lips. Not one time have I said anything to Jerry about  
a contract extension. Number two. Not one time have I ever said to 
Chan that I am disappointed about my role in the offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin said reports to the contrary are nothing more than  
unfounded, media-generated hype. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin did say he has had talks with both Jones and Gailey before  
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about his 90-minute meeting with Jones and Gailey as  
a three-day mini-camp started Tuesday, Irvin would say only that 
they talked about ``the issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey did not comment about Irvin's contract status, but  
players noted their desire to see the team come to terms him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to take the field without Michael Irvin because I  
don't think we can be a great team offensively without Michael,'' 
said defensive back Deion Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually, players of Michael's caliber are granted contract  
extensions before their contract is up. I love the guy and I want 
to see him remain a Dallas Cowboy and finish his career a Dallas 
Cowboy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin is scheduled to make a base salary of $2.99 million this  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said on Tuesday that he was willing to see to it Irvin  
remained with the team the rest of his career, saying ``it's very 
possible that things will work out so we can get all of the very 
best of Michael on our team this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before his recent dealings with Irvin, Jones had a history of  
re-signing the core players that led the Cowboys to Super Bowl 
victories in 1993 and 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Randall Godfrey, upset with his one-year, $429,000  
contract offer, was absent for a second consecutive day. Gailey 
said he had no new report on his status.

<HEADLINE> Curbs on Sex, Violence Access Nixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a victory for the entertainment industry,  
the House refused today to curb youth access to explicit sexual or 
violent material in video games, movies and elsewhere in modern-day 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 282-146 and came as lawmakers in both parties said  
the restrictions would have violated the Constitution's free speech 
guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
	In a long day of debate, the House also approved tougher steps  
to combat juvenile crime and girded for a politically charged 
showdown over gun control as it struggled to respond to this 
spring's shooting deaths at a Colorado high school. 
</P>
<P>
	With a series of gun votes set for Thursday, President Clinton  
lobbied long distance for passage of mandatory background checks 
for all firearms purchases at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``I urge you to stand up to the gun lobby once again,'' he wrote  
to dozens of lawmakers in a letter from Switzerland, where he was 
attending an international conference. The National Rifle 
Association has lobbied furiously for a less restrictive measure 
than the all-inclusive background checks at gun shows passed by the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., authored the proposed curbs on sexual  
and violent material for minors, saying they were designed to 
``slow the flood of toxic waste into our kids' minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents need our help. Let's stand with them. Nothing we do in  
this life is more important than how we raise our children,'' the 
House Judiciary Committee chairman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal called for curtailing minors' access to pictures,  
drawings, video games, movies, books, recordings or other materials 
containing certain ``explicit sexual material or explicit violent 
material.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The measure drew the opposition of both Democrats and  
Republicans who cited concerns about the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., said the proposal was an  
``unparalleled assault'' on the First Amendment, with its 
guarantees of freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
	And Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., said Hyde's proposal would ``create  
a police force for what is decent, what is violent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Is that a movie like 'Home Alone Three'? Is that a movie like  
`Ben Hur'? Is that a movie like `Saving Private Ryan'?'' Foley 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., hearkened back to the gun control  
debate overhanging the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The mother of teen-age children, she said she was troubled that  
under the Republicans' proposals, a clerk who sold her child 
``Shakespeare in Love'' might be subject to criminal sanctions 
while someone who sold her child a firearm would not. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was a triumph for the entertainment industry, which had  
opposed the curbs. And at one point during the debate, Hyde made an 
acid confession that he could not compete with their political 
action committee -- a reference to campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	In a conference call conducted shortly after the vote, Jack  
Valenti, the president of the Motion Picture Association of 
America, said, ``Of course we worked it hard. ... I think whoever 
drafted the bill drafted it in such a way as to be simply, 
blatantly, and I guess irrefutably, unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	The stepped-up effort against juvenile crime was approved  
249-181. It includes a requirement that all U.S. attorneys 
designate prosecutors to specialize in firearms cases, a provision 
meant to address Republican complaints that only a tiny number of 
such cases are now prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, it calls for stricter penalties for numerous  
crimes, including illegal possession of a firearm with intent to 
take it into a school zone. Prosecutors, rather than judges, would 
have discretion to charge a juvenile as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's letter was dispatched to lawmakers who voted for the  
Brady Law that passed in 1993, establishing a system for checking 
the backgrounds of individuals purchasing guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under pressure from the gun lobby, some in the House have  
proposed gun show legislation that is riddled with new and 
dangerous loopholes similar to those that were defeated in the 
Senate,'' Clinton wrote. The president also telephoned at least two 
wavering Democrats from Air Force One while en route to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic aides expressed pessimism that the White House-backed  
gun provisions could prevail in the House, but Clinton's energetic 
efforts suggested he had not given up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are up against the best lobby in town. We are up against  
Tom DeLay's whip operation. We are up against a lot of money,'' 
House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats expressed annoyance that the party's senior  
lawmaker in the House, Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, was leading 
the charge for the NRA. 
</P>
<P>
	In brief remarks on the floor, Dingell said he was opposing  
Hyde's anti-violence legislation because it would violate the First 
Amendment. And he said he would be back in the well of the House on 
Thursday to defend the Second Amendment's right to bear arms.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Co. Offers BMWs to Employees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLMDEL, N.J. (AP) -- Some employees at a Holmdel architectural  
engineering firm will soon be commuting in style. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28 employees, all of whom have worked at ARCNET for at least  
a year, will be getting brand-new BMWs as part of their benefits 
package. Chief executive Al Galdi will be leasing the vehicles and 
paying the insurance as a way of thanking workers for their efforts 
and convincing them to stick around. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time they turn the key, they'll think what a nice  
company this is,'' Galdi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Each employee eligible for a BMW 323i has picked out the color  
and style of a specific car, Galdi said. The employees will get the 
cars at a ceremony on Thursday at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The cars have a retail purchase value of $29,000. Galdi is  
leasing them for three years, at $7,000 per car, per year. He is 
also paying the insurance, which comes out to about $2,000 per car 
annually. For 28 cars, that comes out to $252,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
	Galdi said he spends much more than that every year on  
recruiting and training new employees. Using the cars to keep 
turnover rates lower would be cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
	ARCNET oversees construction for the telecommunications  
industry. It patented cell phone towers that resemble trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Galdi said the telecommunications industry is fast-paced, and  
once his company trains people, they can often find higher-paying 
jobs at bigger companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping it's going to keep them around,'' he said of the  
cars. ``There's nothing more frustrating than training someone and 
seeing them leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The titles of the cars will be in Galdi's name. But once  
employees get the keys, there are no restrictions on how they use 
the car. Employees are responsible for maintenance, and would have 
to pay the insurance deductible for any accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the leases, the cars are to be traded in for new  
models. Employees can choose to buy the cars, and would still get a 
new model to drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Any employees who leave the company would have to give up their  
BMWs.

<HEADLINE> Teacher Destroys Student's 'Porn' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PANAMA CITY, Fla. (AP) -- A fourth-grade student was reading a  
magazine when his teacher, Wanda Nelson, grabbed it, called it 
``pornography,'' ripped up the offending pages and threw them in a 
trash can. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine was National Geographic, and the pornography was an  
article on evolution that included drawings of naked humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Yesterday, the Cherry Street Elementary School teacher received  
a written reprimand for ``inappropriate action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the school superintendent did not believe censorship was an  
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Bay County School Superintendent Larry Bolinger said he  
supported the teacher's right to stop what she considered a 
disruption, but said she crossed the line when she damaged the 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Sebastian Allen, 10, had taken his older brother's magazine, a  
rare collector's issue, to school after Ms. Nelson had encouraged 
students to bring reading material from home in case they completed 
a state assessment test before time ran out.

<HEADLINE> Savarese-Grant Winner To Fight Lewis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lou Savarese reacted like a veteran when told  
that the winner of his fight against unbeaten Michael Grant on 
Saturday night has a good chance of fighting WBC heavyweight 
champion Lennox Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost absolutely, positively sure,'' Savarese said.  
</P>
<P>
	At least the winner will get on a short list, Savarese was told  
by Lou DiBella, vice president of HBO Sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the heavyweight champion of short lists,'' the 33-year-old  
Savarese countered Wednesday at a news conference for the fight in 
The Theater at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis is scheduled to attend the fight.  
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old Grant's reaction to possibly fighting Lewis was,  
``I really don't think about it. There's a timetable for 
everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's no doubt, however, the winner of the 10-round fight will  
be a major player in the heavyweight division. 
</P>
<P>
	For the winner to get a shot at Lewis, the rematch between Lewis  
and Evander Holyfield would have to fall through. 
</P>
<P>
	That's possible because Time Warner, operator of HBO and  
pay-per-view TVKO, is insisting that Don King sign an agreement 
that Time Warner could order him to withdraw as fight promoter if 
he is indicted in connection with the first fight March 13, which 
many observers thought Lewis won clearly but which ended in a draw. 
King has said he will not sign anything. 
</P>
<P>
	DiBella said King would get paid even if he shouldn't be listed  
as fight promoter. 
</P>
<P>
	Should the fight not happen, Jim Thomas, Holyfield's attorney,  
said, ``I try not to think about what else we're going to do. I can 
encourage them (Time Warner and King) to be flexible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was at the news conference because he, along with Craig  
Hamilton, advises Grant. 
</P>
<P>
	One fight that will not happen, said Grant, is him against  
Holyfield. He considers Holyfield a friend and is trained by Don 
Turner, the WBA-IBF champion's trainer. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant (29-0, 21 knockouts) has won five straight fights inside  
the scheduled distance. Savarese (39-2, 32 knockouts) has won three 
straight since getting knocked out by David Izon in 1997. His other 
loss was on a 12-round decision to George Foreman, also in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight will be the second half of a doubleheader in HBO's  
``Boxing After Dark'' series. The first fight will be a 10-round 
heavyweight match between Jeremy Williams (34-2, 31 knockouts) of 
Long Beach, Calif., and Maurice Harris (14-9-2) of Newark, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris replaces Hasim Rahman (29-1, 24 knockouts) of Baltimore,  
who reportedly injured his back.

	LONDON (AP) -- Alliance &AMP; Leicester PLC and Bank of Ireland Group  
broke off merger talks Wednesday, with both sides saying they could 
not agree on terms.

	John Windeler, group chairman at Alliance &AMP; Leicester accused  
the Dublin-based bank of requesting ``changes to key items which

expanding, and might consider another possible merger or

<HEADLINE> Gore Formally Announcing Candidacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARTHAGE, Tenn. (AP) -- Al Gore formally began his drive for the  
presidency today, promising moral leadership in a speech that 
signals his independence from Bill Clinton and makes ``the crisis 
in the American family'' the centerpiece of his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``With your help, I will take my own values and faith and family  
to the presidency -- to build an America that is not only better 
off, but better,'' he told a hometown crowd of thousands on Main 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``And that is why today, I announce that I am a candidate for  
the president of the United States,'' he declared in a text of his 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, 51, first ran for president in 1988, beginning that  
campaign in front of the same quaint country courthouse that served 
as a backdrop today. He fared poorly, but returns more than a 
decade later as the Democratic front-runner and heir to President 
Clinton's political machine. 
</P>
<P>
	He also stands to benefit from an economy that has boomed since  
the recession of 1992 that left Americans worried about their jobs 
and mortgages -- and receptive to Clinton's promise of better days. 
At the same time, using phrases like ``moral leadership and 
``values and faith and family,'' Gore appears to be distancing 
himself from Clinton's character questions to show he can stand on 
his own as a presidential figure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Together, let us vow ... that we will work through the night,  
so that our children may make a clear start from the right place -- 
a higher place -- in a fresh country,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is claiming partial credit for improving the economy but  
vows not to stop there. He says the new threat to America -- now 
that unemployment is down and housing starts are up -- is what he 
calls the siege against families. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seven years ago, we needed to put America back to work -- and  
we did,'' the vice president said. ``Now we must build on that 
foundation. We must make family life work in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The crisis in the American family today knows no boundary of  
class or race. It is a challenge we share together, and it is one 
we must overcome together,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore believes the crisis manifests itself in many ways: more  
single-parent households; two-parent couples working harder and 
seeing less of their children; kids shooting kids in schools; 
inadequate day care and even longer commutes to and from work. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised to keep the economy growing and ``bring a new wave  
of fundamental change to this nation.'' A shrinking budget deficit, 
he said, is not enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are our deficits now: the time deficit in family life,  
the decency deficit in our common culture; the care deficit for our 
little ones and our elderly parents. Our families are loving but 
over-stretched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He promised action to curb gun violence, a campaign against ``a  
culture of violence and mayhem'' in the entertainment community and 
more after-school programs. He vowed not to privatize Social 
Security and make mental illness a higher priority. 
</P>
<P>
	On one of the most divisive issues in politics, Gore said he  
favored abortion-rights and took what advisers said was a subtle 
dig at the GOP front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some try to duck the issue of choice,'' he said. ``Not me.''  
</P>
<P>
	In a series of interviews leading up to the address, Gore began  
to distance himself from Clinton by giving his sharpest assessment 
of the Lewinsky affair. Gore said Clinton's actions were 
``inexcusable'' and, in an interview with Nashville's WTVF-TV, he 
acknowledged for the first time that the controversy ``wasted 
time'' that could have been devoted to other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also told reporters he would not be afraid as a candidate  
to publicly disagree with Clinton on issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president is opposed by only former New Jersey Sen.  
Bill Bradley for the Democratic presidential nomination. He has 
raised more money than any other candidate, Democratic or 
Republican, and holds a wide lead over Bradley in early polling. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Gore is trailing the Republican front-runner, Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush, in head-to-head polling. In a CNN interview, Bush 
said of Gore: ``He's the status quo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At times, Gore's speech sounded like Bush's on Saturday, when  
the Texas governor kicked off his presidential campaign. Both spoke 
briefly in Spanish, supported faith-based institutions getting 
involved in social programs and talked about compassion in 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, a Vietnam veteran, is a former journalist, House member  
and U.S. senator whose deceased father, Al Gore Sr., also served 
Tennessee in the Senate. In Washington today, the Republican Party 
was staging events to highlight the large portions of his youth 
that Gore spent in the nation's capital as a privileged senator's 
son. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president underscored his experience in foreign policy,  
saying he has been ``tested on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, in a highly autobiographical speech, he continued to return  
to the theme of family: ``When all is said and counted, when we in 
our generation are finished adding up our deeds, our possessions, 
all our material and scientific advances, I believe we will 
ultimately be judged by whether we have strengthened or weakened 
the families that are the hope and soul of America,'' he said, 
</P>
<P>
	Ever so slightly, Gore is suggesting that he will attempt to  
separate himself from Clinton the man while embracing Clinton the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, criticized by the GOP for backing Clinton, said he  
remained loyal throughout the Lewinsky turmoil because the 
president is a friend and ``I keep my commitments -- to my wife and 
to my family and to my job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also told reporters he feels liberated as a candidate and  
will speak his mind -- even if that means disagreeing occasionally 
with his boss on policy. For 6 1/2 years as the understudy, Gore has 
kept any disagreements to himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, everything changes when I become a candidate because I'll  
be describing my own vision for the future, and if that happens to 
be different from what the administration wants, I think that's 
understandable to people,'' Gore told the reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart, in Geneva with the president,  
said of Gore's effort to distinguish himself from Clinton: ``The 
president's agenda on things like the economy, education, the 
environment will prove to be a very successful platform for the 
vice president to run from.''

<HEADLINE> Micky Gilley To Open New Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLANO, Texas (AP) -- Mickey Gilley is getting ready for a sequel  
to his honky-tonk Gilley's, which gained fame when it was featured 
in the movie ``Urban Cowboy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The country-western singer said he plans to open up the new club  
in downtown Dallas, and wants it to be a little more upscale than 
Gilley's, which operated in suburban Houston. That Gilley's, which 
was billed as the world's largest honky-tonk, closed in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's handled properly, the Gilley phenomenon can live on,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The original Gilley's was made famous when it and its mechanical  
bull were featured in the 1980 movie starring John Travolta. 
</P>
<P>
	``The TV stations show the movie `Urban Cowboy' every three to  
six months in Dallas, so they're already advertising for the 
center,'' Gilley said this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Gilley's entertainment center could open next year,  
according to Spencer Taylor of Entertainment Concepts of America.

<HEADLINE> DC Showing Renowned French Painter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) --He was Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, 66, one  
of the most renowned French painters of the 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
	She was 24, the flirty wife of a young diplomat. Not much more  
is known. But Ingres' seductive vision of Louise Albertine de 
Broglie, Viscountess Othenin d'Haussonville, stands out in an 
exhibit at the National Gallery of Art: ``Portraits by Ingres: 
Image of an Epoch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is this country's first show of Ingres portraits.  
</P>
<P>
	``M. Ingres must have been in love with you to paint you like  
that,'' the viscountess was told by Adolphe Thiers -- a friend of 
her family and the artist's mentor in the government of King 
Louis-Philippe. 
</P>
<P>
	She was the daughter of the king's minister of foreign affairs.  
Many years later Thiers became president of France. 
</P>
<P>
	``Notoriously she was very flirtatious, admittedly  
flirtatious,'' said Philip Conisbee, one of the show's curators. 
``There was clearly something going on there in a way, not to imply 
that Ingres was not an extremely happily married man, but he was 
susceptible to the allure of these beautiful society women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the death of his wife, Ingres, then 71, married again.  
</P>
<P>
	Conisbee said Ingres would have frowned on this exhibit. The  
painter considered portraits much less important than his paintings 
of history and myth, now largely forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
	The show had a week's overlap with another at the gallery: the  
work of American expatriate John Singer Sargent. Sargent's 
reputation is also based on his portraits, although he came to 
dislike doing them, and also devoted much of his later life to 
depicting history and myth. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingres painted his last great portrait -- of himself -- at 85.  
Sargent, who later found Ingres one of his favorites, had already 
completed his first portrait, a sketch of his father done at the 
age of five. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingres' long life spanned a variety of French regimes, getting  
along with all of them and doing increasingly well. He was taught 
by his father, a member of the Royal Academy of Painting at 
Toulouse before the French Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	He did two portraits of Napoleon I. One was so harshly  
criticized that Ingres went to Italy, leaving a fiancee behind. He 
married someone else and stayed more than 15 years before going 
back to France. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rome, occupied by Napoleon, he did portraits of French  
officials, including Queen Caroline of Naples, Napoleon's youngest 
sister. She had to flee when Britain defeated Napoleon, and never 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
	``The victorious British came swaggering around,'' said  
Conisbee, who is of British origin himself, ``knocked on his door, 
asking him to make portrait drawings, which he certainly resented 
doing. He regarded himself as a history painter and here he was 
making drawings of the enemy. But he and his wife were living in 
penury and it was the only way he could put together some money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of these brilliant drawings, and others on which his  
reputation partly rests, are in the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	One is a nude study for a portrait of Princess de Broglie --  
Louise Albertine's sister-in-law, known for her shyness and piety -- 
in a heavily draped gown of the period. It was probably done from a 
paid model, the catalog says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ingres continued to study nude figures,'' it explains, ``in  
order to better understand the relationship of the body to the 
voluminous contemporary costume.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ingres also was famous for nude paintings such as ``The Turkish  
Bath,'' bought by Prince Napoleon of the emperor's family. It so 
shocked the princess that Ingres had to exchange it. The current 
show does not include any painted nudes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingres became prosperous and famous under King Louis-Philippe,  
and Napoleon III made him a senator. 
</P>
<P>
	----------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Portraits by Ingres'' will be at the National Gallery through  
Aug. 22, and at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York from 
Oct. 5 through Jan. 2, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Greene Sets Record for 100 Meters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Maurice Greene fulfilled his goal by  
setting the 100-meter world recofd of 9.79 seconds today at an 
international track meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene broke the previous mark of 9.84 set by Donovan Bailey of  
Canada at the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expected it,'' said Greene. ``This is only the beginning.''  
</P>
<P>
	The record was set on a nearly windless evening during a special  
event for top sprinters held in the stadium that will be the main 
venue for the 2004 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene's unofficial time was flashed as 9.78. The official time  
later was set at 9.79. The crowd gave the Kansas City, Kan., native 
a standing ovation as he hugged other athletes and waved the banner 
of his track club HSI (Handling Speed Intelligently). He looked for 
an American flag, but none was readily available. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a special place for me,'' said Greene, who won the  
1997 world championship on the same track. He said he wanted to 
tell his mother the news by phone, but she wasn't home. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as he basked in the record, he set his next goal at 9.76.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's very significant we came to the birthplace of  
track and field to break this record,'' said Ato Boldon of Trinidad 
&AMP; Tobago, who placed second at 9.86. Bruny Surin of Canada finished 
third at 9.97. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Boldon won the regular 100-meter race at 9.97.  
</P>
<P>
	Greene also holds the world indoor record at 60 meters of 6.39,  
set last year, and was ranked the world's No. 1 sprinter for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month at Milan, Italy, Greene won the 100 at 10.16  
and insisted he was only concerned about the competition and not 
the clock. ``I am not obsessed with the world record,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's 100 Wednesday, Greece's Ekaterini Thanou won in  
10.92.

<HEADLINE> New Chief for Energy Dept. Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to head off calls for an overhaul of  
his department, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson named a retired 
four-star general to head security operations today. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Air Force Gen. Eugene Habiger, former commander of all  
U.S strategic nuclear forces, promised to be a ``dictator'' and 
move ``quickly and aggressively'' to fix security shortcomings in 
the department's nuclear weapons programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Following up on a promise made last month, Richardson said that  
Habiger, 60, who retired in August after 35 years in the military, 
would have broad authority to improve security at the department 
and the nuclear weapons labs that have been the target of espionage 
for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has the experience, expertise and determination to change  
the security culture ... and establish the authority and 
responsibility that's been missing,'' Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Habiger, who will take over the recently streamlined and  
centralized security office on July 6, will have an annual budget 
of $800 million and report directly to Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment is the second part of Richardson's two-pronged  
effort to consolidate and elevate security operations at the 
department. Earlier, Ed Curran, a veteran FBI counter-intelligence 
expert, took over the anti-espionage activities at the department, 
also reporting directly to the secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	But it remains uncertain whether the moves will be enough to  
head off growing sentiment in Congress that a deeper restructuring 
will be needed to ensure an end to what critics have called a 
``culture'' of inattention to security at the department and 
especially the research labs. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week a panel of the president's Foreign  
Intelligence Advisory Board said in a scathing 57-page report that 
the DOE bureaucracy ``is quite capable of undoing Secretary 
Richardson's reforms, and may well be inclined to do so if given 
the opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, headed by former Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., urged  
creation of a largely autonomous agency within the department with 
responsibility for nuclear weapons programs including the weapons 
labs. Both the Senate and House are considering establishing such 
an agency. 
</P>
<P>
	But Richardson, in announcing Habiger's appointment, said  
creation of an insulated agency within the department ``is not good 
logic'' and would ``only undermine our national security.'' He has 
argued it would hinder his control over security. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said he would try to work with Congress to get an  
acceptable compromise on what additional measures might be taken to 
ensure nuclear secrets are safeguarded. He said he's ready to 
accept elevating defense programs to an ``under secretary'' level, 
short of creating a new largely autonomous agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Describing himself as a man ``not in the business of taking  
prisoners,'' Habiger said he is confident he can overcome the 
entrenched bureaucracy and ``fiefdom'' mentality that has marked 
the $19 billion department and its historically independent-minded 
research labs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to the challenge,'' said Habiger. When he  
retired from the Air Force, he was commander of the U.S. Strategic 
Command, which has responsibility for all Air Force and Navy 
strategic nuclear forces and missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	A combat veteran, Habiger flew 150 missions as a B-52 pilot  
during the Vietnam War. He lives in San Antonio, Texas.

<HEADLINE> Wife Charged in Pastor's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- A pastor's wife stabbed him to death in the  
groin with a butcher knife early today in an argument over his 
infidelity, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrie Rousonelos, 35, was charged with murder in the slaying of  
Anthony Rousonelos, the 42-year-old pastor of Faith Assembly of God 
Church in St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
	``From my understanding, he admitted to the infidelity and the  
argument ensued from there and the rest, as they say, is history,'' 
said police spokesman Mac Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple had three children -- twin 10-year-old boys and a  
13-year old girl. Two were visiting an aunt, and one was at home at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbor Susan Cooper said Rousonelos came by her home Tuesday  
and told her and her boyfriend that his church had placed him on 
probation for two years because of his infidelity. The pastor said 
he had just told his wife about the affair, Ms. Cooper said.

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Thousands of ethnic Albanian  
refugees returned to Kosovo yesterday despite warnings from 
international agencies that the southern Serb province was still 
perilous -- that aid workers cannot feed the refugees and that NATO 
soldiers are not yet ready to protect them. Two refugees have died 
while crossing minefields. ``We'll make sure they can pick up the 
pieces of their lives ... but we can't do it until it's safe,'' 
said Dennis McNamera, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner

	PUEBLA, Mexico (AP) -- A magnitude 6.7 earthquake destroyed  
homes, toppled church towers and damaged other buildings in central 
Mexico, killing at least 12 people and injuring hundreds. President 
Ernesto Zedillo declared the state of Puebla a disaster area after 
the Tuesday afternoon earthquake. Mexico's National Seismological 
Service said the earthquake was centered near Huajuapan de Leon, 80 
miles south of Puebla. The U.S. Geological Survey calculated the 
epicenter at 70 miles southeast of here, near the city of Tehuacan.

	Japan's TV Nets To Reduce Violence  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese television broadcasters are considering a  
set of guidelines under which they would pledge to refrain from 
airing programs they consider inappropriate for children. Those are 
broadly defined as shows containing ``excessive violence'' or 
``adult language'' between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m., an official from 
Japan's National Association of Commercial Broadcasters said today. 
He spoke on condition of anonymity. The guidelines would be the 
first effort in Japan to designate a special viewing time for 
children.

the Democratic front-runner and heir to President Clinton's 
political machine. Gore will formally declares himself a candidate 
for president this morning. He is opposed by only former New Jersey 
Sen. Bill Bradley for the Democratic presidential nomination. He 
has raised more than any other candidate, Democratic or Republican, 
and holds a wide lead over Bradley in early polling. Yet Gore is 
trailing the Republican front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, in

	U.S. Envoy Makes Pitch to Chinese

<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- A U.S. envoy tried to convince Chinese officials  
today that faulty intelligence, not intentional targeting, caused 
NATO to bomb China's embassy in Yugoslavia. Undersecretary of State 
Thomas Pickering's argument was crucial to reversing deteriorating 
U.S.-Chinese relations. Since the May 7 bombing in Belgrade, 
Beijing has postponed military contacts with the United States and 
suspended talks on trade, arms control and human rights until 
Washington meets demands for redress.

	Internet Cited in Human Rights Movement  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A report released today by Amnesty  
International credits the growth of participation in the human 
rights movement over the past decade to the Internet. The Internet 
made it easier to spread the word about violations and allowed 
information to flow freely in and out of countries with 
censor-heavy governments. As a result, advocates have been 
successful in helping reduce the number of nations that carry out 
government executions or jail political and religious prisoners.

Gwynn, who made his third start after missing 19 games with a

<HEADLINE> Mickelson Waits for the Beeper  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- The second after the beeper goes off,  
Phil Mickelson is gone. 
</P>
<P>
	He swears it won't matter if it's late Saturday afternoon and he  
is leading the U.S. Open by five strokes. And it won't matter, 
either, that winning a major was something he dreamed about since 
he was a toddler, dragging a sawed-off golf club to the beach 
instead of a shovel and pail like the other kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely,'' Mickelson said. ``The beeper goes off, I'm  
exactly five hours away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is standing on the practice tee Wednesday afternoon, looking  
exactly like an expectant father should -- very much in need of both 
news and a shave. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason for that is several thousand miles away, back in  
Scottsdale, Ariz., where Amy Mickelson is scheduled to deliver the 
couple's first child on June 30. They know it's going to be a girl 
and they've already picked out a name -- Amanda -- but a few rocky 
moments earlier in the pregnancy have lent it an unsettling feel. 
</P>
<P>
	In late March, a day after Vijay Singh's wife, Ardena, threw a  
baby shower for Amy at their Florida home, she experienced 
contractions and was taken to the hospital. She was confined to 
bed, but the last month was the only one that passed quietly. 
Mickelson is at that stage where chirping beepers and ringing cell 
phones-- even somebody else's -- tend to make him nervous. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't get in until last night because until we left the  
doctor yesterday morning, I really didn't know whether I was 
coming,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson paused and looked around. Almost every spot on the  
practice tee behind him was taken up by a player. The bleachers in 
front of him were packed with fans. It was almost like the Open was 
having contractions of its own. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an exciting time for me,'' Mickelson said. ``The  
challenge now is to keep the excitement under control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That paradox is hardly the only one that clings to him. He  
played a practice round with Fred Couples, Davis Love and Justin 
Leonard, seeing Pinehurst No. 2 for the first time and 
simultaneously having to map out a route across this minefield of a 
golf course. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday also happened to be Mickelson's 29th birthday, not  
exactly old for a golfer with designs on several major 
championships and a place in the lore of the sport. But he isn't 
the fresh-faced kid who burst onto the PGA Tour seven years ago, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
	Back then, Mickelson was going to be the next great golfer, the  
star of his generation. He was coming off a distinguished amateur 
career, handsome, poised, long off the tee and possessed of a short 
game to die for. Two decades ago, Phil Sr. put a practice green in 
the backyard of the family home in San Diego. Few days in Phil 
Jr.'s childhood passed without an hour or two back there, canning 
long putts or inventing shots to win imagined trophies. 
</P>
<P>
	He's won 13 very real trophies since, but watched his name  
tumble precipitously down the list of soon-to-be-stars. First to 
pass him was Ernie Els, then Tiger Woods. Now, David Duval and 
Leonard usually get bumped ahead, too. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an arbitrary list to be sure. Mickelson has more tour wins  
than any of the four, but Els has two major championships and Woods 
and Leonard own one each. And Duval, also seeking his first major, 
is simply the hottest golfer on the planet for the past 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, you had to like Mickelson's chances here -- at least until  
fatherhood began weighing on his mind. He hits the ball high enough 
to hold the mounded greens, and even when the approach shots 
ricochet into surrounding swales and hollows, Mickelson has the 
shots to recover and save par. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as a U.S. Open, this setup is probably the best I can  
hope for,'' he said. ``The rough off the tee is playable to where 
you can get your next shot close to the green. From there, I've got 
the short game to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More important than the shots, Mickelson seems finally to have  
the resolve to win. This U.S. Open will be his 27th major 
championship. Over that stretch, he has only five top-10 finishes, 
highlighted by thirds in both the Masters and PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	He realizes now that is not good enough. He knows things will  
not be this quiet for long. All around him, all kinds of clocks are 
ticking. He is about to start a family, about to turn 30, about be 
passed even farther by a pack he feels he should be leading, not 
chasing. 
</P>
<P>
	And the fastest way Mickelson can get back on schedule is to win  
a major. 
</P>
<P>
	Here.  
</P>
<P>
	Now.  
</P>
<P>
	Before the beep ... beep ... beep of the rest of his life  
begins. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> UAW Opens Contract Talks With GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- The United Auto Workers began  
contract negotiations today with its biggest adversary, General 
Motors Corp., which is hoping to avoid labor trouble that cost it 
$2 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW President Stephen P. Yokich and GM Chairman Jack Smith  
smiled and shook hands across a 50-seat table at a joint GM-UAW 
education and training center in suburban Detroit, as dozens of 
negotiators watched. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 1 automaker has been working hard to repair its troubled  
relations with the UAW, which struck two GM parts plants last year 
in a dispute largely over work rules and the loss of jobs to 
outside suppliers. The eight-week walkout virtually shut down GM's 
North American operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Yokich and Smith were circumspect in their comments today.  
</P>
<P>
	``We hope to have some discussions that will lead to a great  
contract for GM as well as its employees,'' Yokich said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I echo his same words,'' Smith said. ``We're in the same  
position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The triennial contract negotiations with Detroit's automakers  
began Monday at Ford Motor Co. in Dearborn and were followed 
Tuesday by initial talks at DaimlerChrysler AG's U.S. headquarters 
in Auburn Hills. 
</P>
<P>
	A top U.S. executive for DaimlerChrysler said the fact that he  
works for a German company will have no effect on the labor talks 
involving the former Chrysler Corp. workers in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Stallkamp, president of DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler unit,  
said the talks would be conducted the same way they were before the 
merger of Chrysler and Germany's Daimler-Benz AG. He said the final 
decisions will be made at DaimlerChrysler's U.S. headquarters, not 
in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll keep Stuttgart informed, but there's no approval  
necessary from Stuttgart,'' Stallkamp said at a news conference 
with Yokich. ``It will be an Auburn Hills-UAW kind of an 
agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stallkamp's comments came after he shook hands with Yokich to  
formally start the first contract negotiations since Daimler 
acquired Chrysler. The contract will cover about 75,000 mostly 
hourly workers in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks at all three companies will continue through the  
summer and intensify in early September when the union will pick a 
lead company to negotiate economic issues. The current three-year 
pacts expire Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Stallkamp said DaimlerChrysler wants a contract that maintains  
its flexibility, which in the context of these talks usually means 
the ability to get work rules that make its plants more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economy is doing well, we're doing well as a company,'' he  
said. ``But we're always looking over our shoulder at our 
competition. We've had six to seven years of a very strong 
industry. We want to do what we can as a company to keep that going 
along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Health care costs, overtime, job security and parceling out more  
subassembly work to outside suppliers are other issues in talks 
with all three automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	One potential hangup in this year's DaimlerChrysler negotiations  
could be the UAW's efforts to organize the company's nonunion 
plants in the United States: a Mercedes-Benz plant making sport 
utility vehicles in Alabama and three Freightliner commercial truck 
plants in the Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it is not a bargaining issue in these talks, any  
problems that arise in the organizing campaigns will affect 
DaimlerChrysler's relationship with its largest U.S. union and the 
tenor of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler has taken a neutral position in the organizing  
campaigns. Stallkamp said UAW leaders ``remind us whenever they 
find somebody who's not being neutral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW has been trying to organize the Freightliner plants  
since before the DaimlerChrysler merger. Yokich said there have 
been some serious problems there and at the Mercedes-Benz plant, 
though he was not specific. 
</P>
<P>
	``It started badly, very badly,'' Yokich said. ``Some of the  
things we went through as a union with both of the companies is 
unheard of, even with the anti-union people in America. I think 
we'll get it straightened out eventually.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yokich, who was given a seat on the DaimlerChrysler supervisory  
board, said he has met several times with co-chairmen Juergen 
Schrempp and Robert J. Eaton to discuss the organizing campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's different for the Germans, very different,'' Yokich said.  
``Both of those companies are controlled out of Germany, not out of 
Chrysler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yokich also said he has had ``some reservations'' about the  
merger after working with the former Daimler-Benz management. The 
UAW had endorsed the deal after it was announced in May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``First they send us signals that they think compensation of  
American CEOs are too high, the next I read is that they think 
they're pretty good,'' Yokich said.

<HEADLINE> Stanley Cup Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Bills running back Thurman Thomas, who suffered through four  
straight Super Bowl losses, two at the hands of a team from Dallas, 
smiled as he visited his friend, Dixon Ward of the Sabres, after 
Buffalo's 2-1 Game 4 victory over the Dallas Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he'd like to see us win it,'' Ward said. ``He's turned  
into quite a hockey fan, which is good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any Buffalo team that can beat any Dallas team would have the  
blessing of the Bills. Not that the Sabres want the burden of the 
Bills' championship losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows it has nothing to do with us, but I'm sure all those  
guys who were involved in all those losses to Dallas are watching 
this series pretty closely,'' Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's win ensures Buffalo fans will get to watch one more  
game at Marine Midland Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 24 years ago that the Sabres last played in the Stanley  
Cup finals. They lost to Philadelphia in 1975 in the sixth game at 
home after being tied 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RATTLED SABRE:* Dixon Ward, who scored the winning goal on  
Tuesday, was upset about a recent story in a national publication 
that he felt portrayed him as a media glutton. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters consider Ward a source of colorful quotes and honest  
answers, which is why he draws a big crowd after games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try to help and be a little more animated,'' he said. ``Is  
that a bad trait? I'm not a negative person, and I'm certainly not 
an arrogant person. I just try to be honest and give you something 
that people want to read. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't go out there and say 'Do you guys want to interview  
me?' So if I answer the questions, all of a sudden I'm a media 
hound?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ward said he considered shutting reporters off. ``But then I  
decided that's not really fair,'' he said. ``I don't really care 
what people think about me. I just do the best I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WEATHER OR NOT:* The Sabres are looking forward to playing game  
5 at Reunion Arena but are not crazy about the prospect of having 
to plow through Texas' notorious heat and humidity to get there. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buffalo area returned to normal after a recent heat wave.  
``It was relaxing to come back here and see it get into the 
low-70s,'' Brian Holzinger said. ``It makes the ice conditions 
better and eliminates the fatigue factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's forecast for Dallas is for partly cloudy skies with  
highs in the mid-80s and humid. Temperatures are expected to climb 
back into the 90s by early next week, just in time for a Game 7, if 
necessary, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CUP CRAZY:* If you can't win a Calder Cup, sometimes you just  
have to settle for Stanley. Veteran Randy Cunneyworth's Rochester 
Americans had just lost to the Providence Bruins in the Calder Cup 
finals, the AHL's equivalent of the NHL championship, when he was 
recalled by Buffalo for Tuesday's game. ``It's funny how things 
work out,'' Cunneyworth said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *THE REAL McKEE:* Sabres defenseman Jay McKee is the leading  
plus-minus player in the playoffs with a plus-14. That means the 
Sabres have netted 14 goals with the hard-hitting 21-year-old 
defenseman on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	McKee likes the grinding low-scoring games played between the  
Stars and Sabres. ``It's two teams that rely on their defensive 
style and that's why you've seen low-scoring games,'' McKee said. 
``It's a great series.'' Spoken like a defenseman. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ADVERSITY HERE, PRESSURE THERE:* Playoff buzzwords now include  
``adversity'' and ``pressure.'' It's simple. The team that has just 
lost a game experiences ``adversity'' and is under ``pressure'' to 
win the next one. 
</P>
<P>
	That would place Dallas in an uncomfortable position as it heads  
home after its Game 4 loss. But not all players see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pressure is on both teams right now,'' Sabres forward Stu  
Barnes said. Barnes knows what real pressure is, having failed to 
score in his first 27 games as a Sabre after arriving in a trade 
with Pittsburgh. But he now has six playoff goals.

<HEADLINE> House Members Invest in Tech Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Following a hot investing trend, some House  
members have turned to technology stocks to build their portfolios 
while others relied on mutual funds and real estate, financial 
records covering 1998 showed today. 
</P>
<P>
	A few powerful figures, including Majority Leader Dick Armey and  
Chairman C.W. ``Bill'' Young of the House Appropriations Committee, 
had virtually no investments, though they had a large say in how 
billions of dollars of taxpayers' money was spent. 
</P>
<P>
	The top House Democrat, Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of  
Missouri, joined the ``have-nots'' -- listing only one investment 
valued between $1,001 and $15,000. But the third-ranking 
Republican, Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas, had a momentary 
appearance of great wealth. It didn't last. 
</P>
<P>
	On DeLay's initial form, his wife, Christine, was listed as  
owner of Exxon stock valued in excess of $50 million. In an 
amendment filed 10 days later, DeLay noted the mistake, saying the 
stock was jointly owned and worth between $50,000 and $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock has been sold, and DeLay's real assets were worth  
between $66,003 and $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Annual financial disclosure records show Americans what their  
lawmakers owned and owed, the investments they bought and sold, the 
accounts they established for their children and the income they 
earned from noncongressional endeavors -- subject to a limit of 
$20,505. They show travel paid for by private interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Pay for rank-and-file lawmakers in 1998 was $136,700, with floor  
leaders' salaries set at $151,800 and the speaker's compensation 
fixed at $175,400. 
</P>
<P>
	A presidential candidate, Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, who chairs  
the House Budget Committee, has an investment fund worth between 
$250,001 and $500,000 and annuities worth between $100,002 and 
$200,000. He accepted free trips to a dozen cities, paid for by 
Doubleday Book Co., to promote the book he co-authored: ``Courage 
is Contagious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House Judiciary Committee chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,  
who led the impeachment investigation of President Clinton, handled 
his two investments in the most conservative manner. He kept 
$100,001 to $250,000 in Congress' credit union and an Individual 
Retirement Account -- valued between $15,001 and $50,000 -- in the 
White House credit union. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most unusual filing was by Rep. Jim Turner, R-Texas.  
He had four investments worth between $250,001 and $500,000 as part 
of a nine-page disclosure form, but attached nearly 800 pages of 
his wife's investment trades -- which included numerous days with 
multiple transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, the smaller items are the most fascinating.  
</P>
<P>
	Freshman Rep. Kenneth Lucas, D-Ky., reported earning $575 in  
fees for performing nearly two dozen weddings as the Boone County, 
Ky., executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Reps. Vic Snyder, D-Ark., and Tom Coburn, R-Okla., both  
physicians, kept their medical skills current during weekends or 
recesses. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Snyder made only $344 from his family clinic in Little  
Rock -- far less than his $3,839 in malpractice insurance and other 
expenses -- while Coburn earned $9,008 for ``injections only'' 
administered at the Muskogee Allergy Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Herb Bateman, R-Va., listed the value of his parking space:  
between $1,001 and $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla., a former football star in the Hall  
of Fame, earned $19,250 in sports-related speeches. He also 
received $4,829 in deferred compensation from a pro football labor 
settlement before his election to Congress -- income that does not 
count toward the outside-income limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Freshman Rep. Shelley Berkley, D-Nev., who entered the House in  
January, collected $33,000 last year as a business consultant for a 
huge consumer electronics trade show in Las Vegas. The show is 
sponsored by an affiliate of the Electronic Industries Alliance, 
which pays for the travel, hotel and other expenses of lawmakers 
who attend. 
</P>
<P>
	All honoraria from speeches and appearances must go to charity.  
Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, made a charitable contribution with the 
$50 he received for participating in the Capitol Hill Club Chili 
Cook-off. 
</P>
<P>
	His fellow Texas Republican, Rep. Bill Archer, who chairs the  
House Ways and Means Committee, was one of the lawmakers who made 
technology investments. His more than $3 million in assets included 
400 Microsoft shares valued at $68,000 and 700 shares of Intel 
worth $80,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer is among the few lawmakers who go beyond the requirement  
of listing holdings and unearned income in broad categories. He 
precisely states the actual value of holdings, and in that spirit 
valued his coin collection at $16,326. 
</P>
<P>
	Another House veteran, Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., bought, sold  
or held investments in Computer Associates, Nextel, Netscape and 
the Merrill Lynch Global Tech Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Freshman Rep. David Wu, D-Ore., invested in Microsoft and Intel.  
</P>
<P>
	Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., listed his half interest in the  
``opera house'' building in Plainfield, Ill., which once housed a 
theater and his father's restaurant. It was valued between $100,001 
and $250,000, and produced between $15,001 and $50,000 in rental 
income. 
</P>
<P>
	He also reported his 270-acre farm in Shipman, Ill., was worth  
between $100,001 and $250,000. The farm produced income between 
$15,001 and $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Armey, as in previous years, listed no major assets except his  
$2,400 college professor's pension. But the Texas Republican earned 
the higher salary attached to his leadership post, $151,800. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, R-Fla., the Appropriations Committee chairman, listed a  
$15,001-$50,000 account in the House credit union as his major 
asset.

<HEADLINE> Katydids Fossils Found in Denmark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Katydids were singing pretty much the same song 55 million years  
ago that they do today, researchers analyzing new fossil evidence 
reported today in the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	The katydid fossils, discovered in Denmark, represent the oldest  
known evidence of insects communicating by making distinct noises. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists from the University of Gottingen in Germany drew  
their conclusions from 20,000 bushcricket, or katydid, specimens 
preserved in solidified ocean sediment. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the fossils contain finely detailed impressions of the  
insects' wings and forelegs. They show that the prehistoric 
katydids were calling out to potential mates back then much as they 
do today -- by scraping their wings together. 
</P>
<P>
	From the fossils, the researchers were able to recreate the  
creature's tune, producing a rare sample of what Earth probably 
sounded like long, long ago. That song will be used in exhibits in 
Danish museums. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you listen to living bushcrickets today, some of them are  
making two songs. They are modulating them and making pauses. We 
guess that these ancient bushcrickets were singing only one main 
tone without pauses,'' said Jes Rust, a professor of zoology and 
paleontology at Gottingen. 
</P>
<P>
	David Grimaldi, curator of entomology at the American Museum of  
Natural History in New York, said the fossils push evidence of 
insect communication 15 million years further into the past. 
Similar organs are seen in crickets trapped in 40-million-year-old 
amber, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the northern tip of Denmark's Jutland peninsula, where the  
fossils were found, is chilly and windswept today, the region was a 
subtropical jungle when the insects were alive.

<HEADLINE> Senate Democrats Demand HMO Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats say they will try to gum up Senate  
operations if GOP leaders do not agree to schedule a vote on their 
HMO legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people have been kept in the waiting room too  
long,'' Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said he wants debate scheduled for this month. If it  
isn't set by the end of the week, he said, Democrats would try to 
attach their legislation to unrelated bills beginning next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have tried this strategy on other issues as well,  
including tobacco and the minimum wage, with mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., the No. 2 Republican, said he has  
been negotiating with Democrats all week but is frustrated that 
they won't provide a list of the amendments they want to offer. 
Daschle says he should not have to provide that list. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate committee has already approved a patient rights bill  
that attempts to give patients more control over their medical 
care. Democrats complain that it does not cover enough Americans or 
include enough provisions. They want a chance to amend it on the 
Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickles spokeswoman Gayle Osterberg said Republicans want to  
move ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a great bill that we're very proud of,'' she said.  
``We have moved forward on this in very good faith.''

<HEADLINE>  Rosa Parks Honored by Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rosa Parks, a black woman whose refusal to  
give up her bus seat to a white man turned her into a symbol of the 
civil-rights struggle, has received Congress' highest honor: the 
Congressional Gold Medal. 
</P>
<P>
	At a ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda, Mrs. Parks, 86, was lauded  
Tuesday by President Clinton and leaders of the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank you,'' she said in a low, halting voice, adding that  
she accepted the award for a ``free people'' and for civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank you for what you have done,'' Clinton told Mrs. Parks.  
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 1, 1955, the seamstress, tired after a day's work in  
Montgomery, Ala., refused to give up her seat on a segregated city 
bus and was arrested for her defiance. 
</P>
<P>
	Her arrest set off a lengthy bus boycott by thousands of blacks  
-- led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., then a local minister. 
The boycott lasted about a year until the Supreme Court declared 
Montgomery's bus segregation law unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is the mother of the civil rights movement,'' said Rep.  
Julia Carson, D-Ind., who pushed for the legislation granting the 
Congressional Gold Medal to Mrs. Parks, who now lives in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a celebration of the life of Rosa Parks, who is  
receiving the honor while she can still see it,'' Carson said of 
Mrs. Parks, who appeared frail and had to be helped to her feet 
from her wheelchair, sometimes steadying herself on the arm of 
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank God that when your time came, you were not afraid,''  
House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said at the 
ceremony. ``You had courage, and you sat down for all of America 
and all of America's freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers gave Mrs. Parks an artist's drawing of the medal,  
which is not yet finished. 
</P>
<P>
	``She sat, anchored to that seat, as Dr. King said, by the  
accumulated indignities of days gone by and the countless 
aspirations of generations yet unborn,'' Clinton said. ``Rosa Parks 
said, `I didn't get on that bus to get arrested; I got on that bus 
to go home.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he was only 9 when Mrs. Parks refused to  
stand up. He and his friends ``couldn't figure out anything we 
could do since we couldn't even vote. So we began to sit on the 
back of the bus when we got on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Parks action cost her the seamstress job and prompted  
harassment and threats to her family. So she moved to Detroit in 
1957. She joined the staff of Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., in 1965 
and worked there until retiring in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, Mrs. Parks co-founded a nonprofit group, the Rosa and  
Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development, to help young people 
in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	The first Gold Medal was given to George Washington in 1776 for  
``wise and spirited conduct'' during the Revolutionary War. Recent 
honorees include evangelist Billy Graham, Frank Sinatra, Mother 
Teresa and Nelson Mandela.

<HEADLINE> Family To Explore Sale of Chronicle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Family owned for 134 years, the San  
Francisco Chronicle is a step closer to being sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The board of directors for Chronicle Publishing Co., which owns  
the nation's 11th-largest daily newspaper, voted unanimously 
Wednesday to proceed with formal exploration of the company's sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street investment firm Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette  
will evaluate all potential buyers and transactions, a process that 
is expected to take several months. All or part of the company's 
holdings may be sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Chronicle Publishing spokesman Don Solem said there has been  
``great interest'' in the company since the investment firm was 
hired last month. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the board has have ``been surprised by the robust market  
and the high level of interest in Chronicle Publishing Co., so this 
is definitely a big step forward in the direction of sale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A timeline for selling the company would depend on the market  
and the number of offers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chronicle Publishing owns the Chronicle, the Bloomington  
Pantagraph in Illinois and the Worcester Telegram &AMP; Gazette in 
Massachusetts. It owns television stations KRON, San Francisco's 
NBC affiliate; KAKE in Wichita, Kan.; and WOWT in Omaha, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	Its holdings also include a Web site and two book publishing  
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The company more than likely would be sold in pieces rather than  
its entirety, Solem said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very unique property and properties don't come on  
the market like this very often,'' Solem said. ``If you look at 
what's in the bundle -- three television stations, a major 
newspaper, book publishing, Internet, two pretty good-sized 
newspapers -- that's a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One media consultant estimated last month that the paper alone  
could fetch $400 million to $1 billion or more, based on the 
paper's 482,000 circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got 10 different businesses. We have negotiations with a  
lot of different companies and a lot of different combinations'' to 
explore, Chronicle Chief Executive Officer John B. Sias said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chronicle Publishing is owned by the descendants of M.H. de  
Young, who founded the newspaper with his brother in 1865. The 
board has five family members and five outside directors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chronicle and its rival, the San Francisco Examiner, have  
long been the subject of rumors that have one paper buying out the 
other or the two papers merging. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst Corp., which owns the Examiner, has said it has the right  
of first refusal to buy the Chronicle under an agreement between 
the two firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Examiner publisher Timothy O. White did not immediately return a  
telephone message left Wednesday by The Associated Press.

<HEADLINE> FDA Issues Diabetes Drug Warnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The controversial diabetes drug Rezulin can  
continue selling but consumers should receive special warnings with 
each prescription noting that it can cause sudden and lethal liver 
failure, the government decided today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration also told doctors that fewer  
patients should receive Rezulin -- only those whose diabetes is not 
adequately treated by competing medicines. Rezulin is not intended 
as a first-line drug. 
</P>
<P>
	And all Rezulin users will have to get even more frequent liver  
tests than previously required, the FDA ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturer Parke-Davis mailed letters to hundreds of thousands  
of doctors Wednesday notifying them of the new restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning in a few weeks, consumers will receive the special  
warnings -- information sheets known as ``patient package inserts'' 
-- at the drugstore when they purchase Rezulin. The sheets will 
inform them that because Rezulin can damage the liver, they will 
need a liver test every month during the first year of Rezulin use, 
and quarterly testing every year after that. 
</P>
<P>
	However, testing isn't fail-safe: Several patients have suffered  
fatal liver damage just weeks after they passed a liver test. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overall message is that patients should speak to their  
physicians about whether Rezulin is right for them, or whether 
there are alternatives that will control their disease,'' said 
FDA's endocrinology chief, Dr. John Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocates had urged the FDA to ban Rezulin, and  
denounced the FDA's move as inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain banned Rezulin over a year ago and specialists there say  
patients haven't missed the drug, said Dr. Sidney Wolfe of the 
consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. He advises Rezulin users to 
ask their doctors about switching to other medicines. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last month, the FDA approved a new diabetes drug called  
Avandia that works the same way as Rezulin but appears to have less 
liver risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Rezulin, known chemically as troglitazone, was widely cheered  
when it hit the market in 1997 as the first drug that resensitizes 
the body to insulin, the underlying problem of Type II or 
adult-onset diabetes. Many doctors contend it is invaluable for 
patients who have failed other therapies. 
</P>
<P>
	But the drug also can kill. As of last March, the FDA had  
counted 43 patients who suffered acute liver failure after taking 
Rezulin for several months, 28 of whom died and seven who survived 
only with liver transplants. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the FDA has received fewer than 11 additional  
reports of deaths but it has not finished investigating how many 
are truly linked to Rezulin, Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	FDA officials note that they frequently learn of only 10 percent  
of drug side effects, so Rezulin's impact could be larger. 
</P>
<P>
	But a recent study showed a disturbing trend: Less than half of  
doctors surveyed tested Rezulin patients' livers despite FDA's 
repeated warnings to do so. Calling that ``abysmal,'' FDA's 
scientific advisers recently demanded that Parke-Davis warn 
consumers to insist on testing for their own safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA's action Wednesday does not ensure that every consumer  
will get the special ``patient package inserts.'' No law requires 
that pharmacists distribute them. But the FDA chose not to use a 
stronger option, a new program that lets the government force 
manufacturers to put ``MedGuides,'' special brochures written in 
layman's terms, inside every box they sell.

<HEADLINE> Hemingway 100th Birthday Celebrated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Few authors, living or dead, approach the  
stature of Ernest Hemingway, and the 100th anniversary of his birth 
is being celebrated like few other birthdays. 
</P>
<P>
	A week-long celebration in his home town, two national exhibits  
and the publication of a ``new'' book by Hemingway, who killed 
himself in 1961, are among the events. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been an influence not only in American literature, but in  
most other literatures too,'' said curator Fred Voss, showing 
reporters around the exhibit that opens Saturday at the National 
Portrait Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even people who've never read Hemingway know him, and what he  
looked like,'' Voss said. ``Can you think of any other best-selling 
author whose picture most people would recognize?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who don't know what he looked like will find scores of  
photos, portraits and mementos at the gallery. They include a piece 
of the shrapnel -- made into a ring -- that hit his leg and ended his 
World War I career after a few weeks as an ambulance driver on the 
Italian front. 
</P>
<P>
	There is also a photo of Agnes von Kurowsky, the Red Cross nurse  
at the hospital whose affair with him was the basis of his novel, 
``A Farewell to Arms.'' It was far from a farewell. In World War II 
he was active with the French Resistance and got into trouble with 
other war correspondents because he collected arms for its 
fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	Another photo portrays him as an amateur bullfighter, like the  
subjects of ``The Sun Also Rises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He never wanted to be a bystander,'' Voss noted.  
</P>
<P>
	Writers the world over have tried to imitate Hemingway's  
flamboyant personal way of living, spare writing style and his 
readiness to use what many at the time considered objectionable 
language. Even his own mother wrote him that shame had kept her 
from a meeting of her book club when it was discussing one of his 
novels, Voss said. 
</P>
<P>
	His last book, edited by his son, Patrick Hemingway, is called  
``True at First Light'' and has received mixed reviews. The 
publisher calls it ``a blend of autobiography and fiction,'' 
recording a safari he took with his wife, Mary, to Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their attempts to love each other well are marred by cruelty,  
competition and infidelity,'' says the dust jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ernest has become involved with Debba, an African girl whom he  
supposedly plans to take as a second bride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oak Park, Ill. the affluent Chicago suburb where Hemingway was  
born, is also mounting an exhibit at the Ernest Hemingway 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	And at the Four Seasons hotel in downtown Chicago ``La Fete  
Ecrivain,'' the writer's party, on July 14 kicks off a week-long 
celebration highlighting Hemingway's Paris years. 
</P>
<P>
	Hemingway's hometown exhibit will travel to other places where  
he lived, in Florida, Arkansas and Idaho, and possibly to other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Hemingway would have been 100 on July 21. He killed himself with  
a shotgun at his home in Ketchum, Idaho, less than three weeks 
before his 61st birthday and seven years after winning the Nobel 
Prize. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Picturing Hemingway: A Writer in His Time'' will be at the  
National Portrait Gallery through Nov. 7. Admission is free.

<HEADLINE> NBA Finals Finally Begin Tonight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The San Antonio Spurs have spent most of the  
past five days insisting they're not overconfident heading into the 
NBA Finals against the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	The more you listen to them, the more you wonder whether they  
really mean it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a confident team. We feel good about ourselves,'' Mario  
Elie said. ``I mean this is probably -- not disrespecting the Knicks 
-- this is probably the weakest team we're going to play in the 
playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elie has been the talkative type as everyone has waited around  
for the finals to begin, but he would not be baited into making any 
guarantees Tuesday on the eve of Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he exudes self-assurance, just like all of the Spurs, who  
enter this series with a 10-game winning streak that is just one 
short of the record set by the Los Angeles Lakers in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks entered Game 1 with a little streak of their own,  
having won the first game of their first three series in this 
year's playoffs. All three victories, against Miami, Atlanta and 
Indiana, came on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a statement for the opposing team,'' Chris Childs said.  
``Once you lose that first game at home, it changes everything you 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Latrell Sprewell: ``It's like a wake-up call, It lets them  
know we're here to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The themes of this best-of-7 series have been clearly  
established in the days since the Knicks beat Indiana in Game 6 of 
the Eastern Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks, who will definitely be without Patrick Ewing and  
could be without Larry Johnson, need to establish their running 
game to make up for their clear disadvantage in height. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, if Latrell Sprewell, Marcus Camby and Co. can't  
produce as much on the fast break as Tim Duncan and David Robinson 
can in the low post, the Knicks don't figure to stand much of a 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Patrick out, Larry is our dominant post player,''  
Sprewell said. ``And if he's gone, Marcus and Kurt Thomas are going 
to have to step up because we need a presence inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from their 10-game winning streak, the Spurs enter this  
series with a 42-6 record since the end of February. 
</P>
<P>
	They had the best regular-season record leaguewide, swept the  
second round against the Los Angeles Lakers and swept the Portland 
Trail Blazers in the Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it all came together was when we really started playing  
together as a team,'' Duncan said. ``We don't rely on any one 
person to do it for us on any given night. There's a whole lot of 
people you really have to keep an eye on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If New York chooses to double-team Duncan and Robinson in the  
low post, it'll mean that they're conceding open shots to Avery 
Johnson, Mario Elie, Sean Elliott and some of the Spurs reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the strategy most teams have used against San Antonio,  
with obviously limited results. 
</P>
<P>
	``The common strategy with Avery Johnson in particular, no  
matter where he played the last decade, was to make Avery Johnson 
beat you,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``And that's what he 
always does. People leave him open, he beats them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elliott's a former All-Star and great knockdown 3-point  
shooter with a rocket first step, and Elie's a great defender, good 
spot-up shooter and takes the ball to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to stop all of them,'' Van Gundy said.  
</P>
<P>
	Aside from stopping New York's transition game, the Spurs will  
have to contain Sprewell and Allan Houston in the kind of 
one-on-one isolation plays the Pacers had trouble stopping in Game 
6. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's status for Game 1 remains uncertain.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's still going to be a game-time decision,'' he said  
Tuesday. ``It feels better than it did yesterday. That's my 
positive sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A massage therapist is working on the knee. Johnson planned to  
test it today at the Knicks' shootaround. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even when I do come back, a bulky brace. Five, six days off,  
out of rhythm, a little bit out of shape. Tough. But this is the 
finals. There's no excuses, no lowering your head,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson has said he might play in the opener of the series. The  
possibility of playing in Friday's Game 2 ``looks a whole lot 
better'' than it did only couple of days ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, meanwhile, was told that Elliott has been studying  
tapes, and learned that Sprewell never drives to his left. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's no big secret. Everybody knows I go right, but that  
first step is hard to contain at times. I don't know if he's going 
to be able to stop me even if he knows it.''

<HEADLINE> Dan Marino Signs Two-Year Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Dan Marino, the only active member of the NFL  
quarterback class of 1983, intends to remain with the Miami 
Dolphins into the next millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino signed a two-year contract extension that goes through  
the 2001 season, the team said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited about the upcoming season,'' Marino said. ``I  
really feel as though we will continue to improve as a team like we 
have each of the last two years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Financial terms weren't disclosed, but the deal was expected to  
include a signing bonus of about $6.4 million. The contract was 
designed primarily to create about $2 million in salary-cap space 
for the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to have this extension completed,'' Marino said.  
``Not only does it put to rest any questions about my contract 
status before the start of the season, but it also gives the 
Dolphins more room under the salary cap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Marino signed a one-year contract extension that would  
have expired at the end of the 1999 season. He signed a three-year 
contract in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino, who turns 38 in September, has said he plans to play  
until he's at least 40. He's the last quarterback from the NFL 
class of 1983 following the retirement of Denver's John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway and Marino were among six quarterbacks drafted in the  
first round that year. The others were Jim Kelly, Ken O'Brien, Tony 
Eason and Todd Blackledge. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino started all 16 regular-season games in 1998, completing  
310 of 537 passes for 3,497 yards and 23 touchdowns with 15 
interceptions. He ranked in the top three among AFC quarterbacks 
last year in attempts, completions, passing yardage and touchdown 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that if we are to have success again this year, Dan  
will be a big part of that,'' Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson said. 
``He performed extremely well last season, and I know he will do 
everything he can to have an even better year in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 16-year career, Marino has completed 4,763 of 7,989 passes  
for 58,913 yards and 408 touchdowns, all NFL records. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins have made steady improvement since Johnson became  
coach, from 8-8 in 1996 to 9-7 in 1997 and 10-6 last season, when 
they won a playoff game for the first time in four years, beating 
Buffalo 24-17 in a wild-card game. A 38-3 playoff loss against the 
Denver Broncos ended Miami's bid to return to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino played in his only Super Bowl in January 1985. San  
Francisco intercepted him twice and defeated Miami 38-16.

<HEADLINE> Armand Assante in Civil War Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Armand Assante said he's always been  
fascinated by the Civil War. He got a chance to learn even more 
about the conflict when he starred in a made-for-cable movie about 
one of its battles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Hunley,'' which premieres next month on Turner Network  
Television, is the story of the hand-cranked Confederate submarine 
that sank a Union blockade ship before going down with its nine-man 
crew in 1864. It was the first sub in history to sink an enemy 
warship. 
</P>
<P>
	The cast shot scenes in a sometimes-flooded mockup on a sound  
stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The experience was very, very powerful. It's like getting into  
a double boiler,'' said the Emmy-winning actor, who plays 
Confederate Lt. George Dixon. ``Those guys were getting into a 
human coffin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only way actors on the sound stage could get air was through  
an air regulator, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You couldn't get out because the camera crew was literally  
bolted in. You can't get out; you can't go up or down,'' Assante 
said. ``It really brought home the visceral feeling of what those 
men were willing to put themselves through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mockup on the lake -- really the top half of the sub  
supported by air bags -- had a 145-pound hatch. 
</P>
<P>
	With that hatch closed and water coming up around the sides,  
Assante said, ``It was horrifying.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Promises Moral Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARTHAGE, Tenn. (AP) -- Al Gore formally begins his drive for the  
presidency today, promising moral leadership in a speech that 
signals his independence from Bill Clinton and makes ``the crisis 
in the American family'' the centerpiece of his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seven years ago, we needed to put America back to work -- and  
we did,'' the vice president said in a draft of his announcement 
address to a hometown crowd. ``Now we must build on that 
foundation. We must make family life work in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, 50, first ran for president in 1988, beginning that  
campaign in front of the same quaint country courthouse that serves 
as a backdrop today. He fared poorly, but returns more than a 
decade later as the Democratic front-runner and heir to President 
Clinton's political machine. 
</P>
<P>
	He also stands to benefit from an economy that has boomed since  
the recession of 1992 that left Americans worried about their jobs 
and mortgages -- and receptive to Clinton's promise of better days. 
At the same time, Gore appears to be distancing himself from 
Clinton's character questions to show he can stand on his own as a 
presidential figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is claiming partial credit for improving the economy but  
vows not to stop there. He says the new threat to America -- now 
that unemployment is down and housing starts are up -- is what he 
calls the siege against families. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crisis in the American family today knows no boundary of  
class or race. It is a challenge we share together, and it is one 
we must overcome together,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore believes the crisis manifests itself in many ways: more  
single-parent households; two-parent couples working harder and 
seeing less of their children; kids shooting kids in schools; 
inadequate day care and even longer commutes to and from work. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president is opposed by only former New Jersey Sen.  
Bill Bradley for the Democratic presidential nomination. He has 
raised more than any other candidate, Democratic or Republican, and 
holds a wide lead over Bradley in early polling. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Gore is trailing the Republican front-runner, Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush, in head-to-head polling. 
</P>
<P>
	Though concerned about his prospects, Democrats say Gore has  
plenty of time to close the gap. They say he must start today by 
telling people who he is and what he would do outside Clinton's 
shadow. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vice presidents check their identities at the door,'' said  
Democratic consultant Dane Strother. ``He needs to reclaim his 
identity and jettison this cocoon of the vice presidency to fill 
out his own campaign and fill out his own personal history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, a Vietnam veteran, is a former journalist, House member  
and U.S. senator whose deceased father, Al Gore Sr., also served 
Tennessee in the Senate. In Washington today, the Republican Party 
was staging events to highlight the large portions of his youth 
that Gore spent in the nation's capital as a privileged senator's 
son. 
</P>
<P>
	Portions of Gore's speech were provided to The Associated Press  
by senior advisers who also outlined the themes of the address. 
</P>
<P>
	They said Gore was unveiling no new policies, saving that for  
other days in his five-day campaign swing. He was explaining that 
his agenda would help families cope. 
</P>
<P>
	The issues include gun control, universal preschool, easing  
traffic congestion, improving community planning and making 
``revolutionary changes'' in public education. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask for your help to strengthen family life in America and I  
make you this pledge: If you entrust me with the presidency, I will 
marshal its authority, its resources and its moral leadership to 
fight for America's families,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With your help, I will take my own values and faith and family  
to the presidency -- to build an America that is not only better 
off, but better,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In using phrases such as ``moral leadership'' and ``values and  
faith and family,'' Gore appears to be distinguishing himself from 
Clinton, whose character was smudged in the Monica Lewinsky affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever so slightly, Gore is suggesting that he will attempt to  
separate himself from Clinton the man while embracing Clinton the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people realize any two individuals are very different,  
and certainly the president and I are,'' Gore told reporters 
Tuesday when asked about the lingering impact of the Lewinsky 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, criticized by the GOP for backing Clinton, said he  
remained loyal throughout the Lewinsky turmoil because the 
president is a friend and ``I keep my commitments -- to my wife and 
to my family and to my job.'' In perhaps his most pointed 
assessment of the president's conduct to date, Gore said, ``I felt 
what the president did, especially as a parent, was inexcusable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also told reporters he feels liberated as a candidate and  
will speak his mind -- even if that means disagreeing occasionally 
with his boss on policy. For 6 1/2 years as the understudy, Gore has 
kept any disagreements to himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, everything changes (today) when I become a candidate  
because I'll be describing my own vision for the future, and if 
that happens to be different from what the administration wants, I 
think that's understandable to people,'' Gore told the reporters.

<HEADLINE> Reform of Forfeitures Gains Ground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Owners of property seized by the government  
under suspicion it was linked to criminal activity would have an 
easier time challenging such actions under a bill that has moved 
closer to a full House vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Judiciary Committee voted 27-3 Tuesday to send the  
measure, sponsored by its chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., to the 
House floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde, who has sought to overhaul civil asset forfeiture laws for  
years, contends that the statutes, while meaningful, often deprive 
citizens of property, such as houses, cars, jewelry and boats, 
without due process, especially those who had no idea the property 
was being used illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted, for example, that the government doesn't have to  
convict anyone or charge anyone with a crime in order to seize 
their assets. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the government needs to do to seize and confiscate your  
property is establish that probable cause existed to believe that 
the property was involved in some crime, ... that it facilitated a 
crime or represents its proceeds,'' Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials say the laws are applied fairly in the  
majority of cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The main provision of Hyde's bill would force the government to  
prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that property seized had 
been used in or resulted from criminal activity. Now, individuals 
must prove the property wasn't used in a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Another provision would permit judges to release such property  
pending the outcome of a case if continued possession by the 
government would cause ``substantial hardship'' to the owner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department has opposed similar provisions in the  
past. Department officials did not return telephone calls for 
comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Reps. Ed Bryant of Tennessee and Asa Hutchinson of  
Arkansas, both former U.S. attorneys, and Rep. Anthony David 
Weiner, D-N.Y., opposed the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	They said they supported Hyde's attempt to make the process more  
fair but objected to the provision increasing the government's 
burden. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson also criticized provisions requiring judges to  
appoint attorneys for poor clients, the return of property in 
hardship cases and protection of ``innocent owners'' from losing 
the seized asset. Innocent owners either didn't know the property 
was used for illegal purposes or tried to keep others from using 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important reform that takes us in the right direction but  
that tilts too far against law enforcement in favor of, 
potentially, the drug dealer,'' Hutchinson said. ``The reform goes 
too far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1658.

<HEADLINE> Ramon Martinez Feeling Good </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Ramon Martinez was all smiles Wednesday after  
pitching his strongest simulated game since undergoing surgery on 
his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best I have pitched without any discomfort,''  
Martinez said after throwing 54 pitches. ``It's a good feeling. 
It's a great feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez used his changeup, fastball, slider and breaking ball  
to pitch four innings before Boston's game Wednesday night against 
the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
	``His fastball and changeup were his best to date,'' pitching  
coach Joe Kerrigan said. ``He had a great smile on his face. If you 
saw the expression on his face, you knew he felt pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez had spent 11 years with Los Angeles before becoming a  
free agent after rotator cuff surgery ended his season last June. 
Martinez was 123-77 with a 3.45 ERA for the Dodgers, winning 20 
games in 1990 and pitching a no-hitter against the Florida Marlins 
in July 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	If Martinez experiences no soreness or stiffness in his  
shoulder, he likely will be ready for a rehabilitation assignment 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Trot Nixon, who hit against Martinez in simulated games  
Wednesday and last Friday, said he hopes Ramon will be pitching 
again soon for selfish reasons: so he doesn't have to hit against 
him anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather face someone other than him,'' Nixon said. ``He  
looked that good. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had more pop on his game than on Friday,'' Nixon added.  
``He was a lot more fluid and it looked like he felt better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Creighton Gubanich, who caught for Martinez last Friday and hit  
against him Wednesday, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked like he had a little more velocity today,'' Gubanich  
said. ``It was pretty much a battle out there. I had a tough time 
seeing the ball coming out of his hand and picking up his pitches. 
He's throwing the ball hard enough where he could probably start 
pitching.''

<HEADLINE> Dole Says She's Running To Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Republican White House hopeful Elizabeth  
Dole sought today to halt speculation that she is really running 
for vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am in it to win,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole has formed a presidential exploratory committee but  
has not formally announced her intention to seek the White House, 
as GOP front-runner Texas Gov. George W. Bush did last weekend and 
Vice President Al Gore did Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me set the record straight: You do not go through this  
process, which is a rigorous one, to be vice president,'' she told 
reporters before a speech here. ``If you enter the process, which I 
have, you do it to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked later when she will announce her plans, Mrs. Dole said:  
``Stay tuned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole never stopped smiling as she described the trials of  
the campaign trail for an audience of about 300 Rotary Club 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am on the road right now for nine days, if you can imagine --  
one little suitcase and one little ... bag,'' she said. ``You can't 
check your luggage because you'd never get there on time for your 
appointments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole offered several promises relating to the high-tech  
industry. She said she would press for a permanent federal 
research-and-development tax credit, something industry in Silicon 
Valley has long sought. 
</P>
<P>
	She backed legislation passed by the Senate on Tuesday that  
would curb lawsuits related to Year 2000 computer problems, and 
noted that the ``Clinton-Gore administration'' has threatened a 
veto. And she called for increasing the cap on the number of highly 
skilled workers allowed into the country under special visas, 
something industry here has requested. 
</P>
<P>
	Her pitch was tailored to computer industry employees and she  
was the latest in a growing list of presidential candidates making 
pilgrimages to the Silicon Valley. Another Republican candidate, 
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., will tour a nearby computer company on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about a dozen computer employees were in Mrs. Dole's  
audience, however, because the Rotary Club limits membership by 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole used her trademark mingling technique to address the  
crowd. When her microphone acted up, she asked, still smiling: 
``With all the high-tech people who are probably in this audience, 
does anybody have advice as to how to keep that from happening?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers told her to simply keep going, but eventually she  
gave up and spoke from the podium. 
</P>
<P>
	After the speech, she was scheduled to hold a session with  
reporters, but told them she didn't have time and added that she 
had fielded queries before the speech. 
</P>
<P>
	That precipitated a heated exchange between her and a newspaper  
reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	After insisting she had to go, the famously self-controlled wife  
of Bob Dole told the reporter: ``Take it easy. Blood pressure down. 
What's your question?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently she didn't follow the script again,'' said David  
Manns, who works in her press office. ``People say she follows this 
nice, neat little plan, but let me tell you, she doesn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole attended a fund-raiser in Atherton, Calif., later  
Wednesday, and said women entrepreneurs were helping to spearhead 
her fund-raising effort.

<HEADLINE> Panel OKs Nuke-Waste Storage Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans on Wednesday took a major  
step toward compromising with the Clinton administration over the 
disposal of commercial nuclear waste, abandoning their demands for 
a temporary storage site in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, legislation that would keep the waste at nuclear  
reactors in 34 states, with the federal government taking ownership 
of the waste, cleared the Senate Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee by a 14-6 vote. All 11 Republican members of the panel 
voted for the measure, which now awaits Senate floor action. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Clinton administration has not fully embraced the  
bill, it marked a possible breakthrough in the five-year 
controversy over the government's refusal to assume responsibility 
for more than 40,000 tons of highly radioactive waste kept at 
nuclear reactors. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a major concession,'' said Sen. Frank Murkowski,  
R-Alaska, who proposed the compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson in February offered a similar  
approach, with the government taking title of waste at reactors, 
but there remain disagreements over the establishment of radiation 
health standards in a future waste disposal site. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past five years, supporters of a nuclear waste bill  
have repeatedly been stymied in attempts to enact legislation that 
would establish a temporary central storage site for nuclear waste 
in Nevada until a permanent burial site is approved and built in 
the state's Yucca Mountain area. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry has argued that the government was committed to  
taking the waste and finding a temporary site. But President 
Clinton has insisted an interim storage site, proposed for Nevada, 
would interfere in development of the permanent underground Yucca 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
	In an attempt to break the deadlock, Murkowski on Wednesday  
offered his compromise. Under the proposal, the waste would remain 
where it is, but the government would officially have custody of it 
until the construction permit for the Yucca facility is issued, 
possibly as early as 2007. In turn, utilities would drop lawsuits 
against the Energy Department for failing to take the waste. 
</P>
<P>
	But Murkowski acknowledged some hurdles remain.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, the ranking Democrat on the  
committee, opposed the compromise -- along with five other Democrats 
-- because they said it would strip the Environmental Protection 
Agency of authority to regulate radiation exposure levels at the 
future Yucca waste site. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a show stopper with the administration and with me,''  
said Bingaman. He sought approval for a virtually identical 
alternative measure that would continue to have the EPA regulate 
exposure levels, but it was voted down 13-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Murkowski's proposal calls on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  
to set radiation exposure standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA traditionally has pushed for more stringent standards,  
including a groundwater-protection requirement that the nuclear 
industry claims is impossible to meet. ``We need standards that are 
achievable,'' Murkowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Murkowski said the EPA wants to limit the release of radiation  
from the future Yucca site to comply with the federal drinking 
water law. Such a strict level is not appropriate for groundwater 
in the Nevada desert ``in an area that has had extensive nuclear 
testing,'' argued Murkowski. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was more in tune with  
establishing ``reasonable'' standards for the future disposal site 
that would hold thousands of tons of highly radioactive wastes -- 
mostly used reactor fuel -- from the more than 100 civilian reactors 
as well as defense-related waste. 
</P>
<P>
	Bingaman, who has conferred with the Energy Department on the  
issue, said the administration likely would veto legislation that 
``would strip the EPA of authority in this matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An Energy Department official, who spoke on condition of  
anonymity, said the removal of the EPA from setting the radiation 
standard was ``a killer issue'' yet to be resolved. Still, this 
official said, the compromise reflects significant progress because 
the interim-storage idea is being dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Murkowski too said his proposal mirrors what the administration  
had proposed with only one controversy remaining: whether the NRC 
or the EPA should have set the radiation exposure standards.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Bill To Limit Y2K Suits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supporters of legislation to curb Y2K-related  
lawsuits, encouraged by a strong Senate vote, say the U.S. economy 
is at stake and that the White House should reconsider its veto 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that the president would not veto'' the bill, said Sen.  
Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., who joined 11 other Democrats and 50 
Republicans Tuesday in the 62-37 vote to pass the bill. ``I can't 
tell you the depth of passion that the high tech industry feels 
about this bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, passed in a different version by the House and  
now heading for a House-Senate conference, has been avidly backed 
by the high tech and business community, which say it can help 
prevent billions of dollars in lawsuits arising from computers that 
could produce a variety of problems by misreading the year 2000 as 
1900. 
</P>
<P>
	But the administration, backed by consumer groups and trial  
lawyers, has threatened a veto, saying the bill undercuts legal 
rights to seek damages and would discourage companies from fixing 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's vote was five short of the two-thirds needed to  
override a presidential veto, but Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz, the 
chief sponsor, said he would work to prevent that veto. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are now at the moment of truth in this struggle between  
those who would restrain the engine of our economic growth and 
those who would protect it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the momentum has shifted in our direction. The president  
is going to have to cooperate,'' said National Association of 
Manufacturers president Jerry Jasinowski. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a simple choice. It's time for the White House to do the  
right thing,'' said U.S. Chamber of Commerce president and CEO 
Thomas J. Donohue. 
</P>
<P>
	But it won't be simple for the White House to choose between the  
arguments of the high tech industry, which has been a strong 
financial supporter of both President Clinton and Vice President Al 
Gore, and the trial lawyers and consumer groups, also political 
allies, who strongly oppose the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Joan Claybrook, president of the advocacy group Public Citizen,  
said the bill was a ``disincentive for the industry to behave.'' 
She said the bill might ``boomerang'' on senators who supported it 
if the new millennium dawns with major disruptions because 
businesses unconcerned about getting sued don't fix computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters insisted that won't happen and that wrongdoers will  
still be held liable. The bill does provide a 90-day cooling off 
period to allow businesses to fix computers before they can be sued 
and encourages mediation. 
</P>
<P>
	It discourages the practice of looking for deep-pocketed  
companies to sue by stating that in most cases a company would be 
held liable for only that portion of damages it causes, limits 
class action lawsuits and sets punitive damage caps for small 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without the Y2K act, we run the risk of starting a gold rush  
for prospecting lawyers in search of Y2K gold,'' said Sen. 
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who worked with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., 
to make the legislation more consumer-friendly and acceptable to 
the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The final product, while still unacceptable to the White House,  
was generally more moderate than a version passed by the House last 
month in a more partisan vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., a chief sponsor of that bill, said they  
were ready to start negotiations immediately with the Senate and 
said the strong Senate vote would be a factor in coming up with a 
compromise. But he added that ``we're not going to let the trial 
lawyers right the bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill offers punitive damage caps to all defendants who  
make a good faith effort to correct problems, extends proportionate 
liability to more defendants and includes a loser-pay provision.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Morning Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks advanced sharply Thursday morning  
following gains on Wall Street. The dollar was lower against the 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 262.03 points,  
or 1.52 percent, to end the morning session at 17,472.21. On 
Wednesday, the Nikkei had dropped 71.82 points, or 0.42 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.14 yen by late morning, down 0.10 yen from  
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
120.43 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, Tokyo share prices were sharply higher  
following the rally in U.S. stocks on flat consumer price index 
data indicating that U.S. inflation pressures had eased in May, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average  
gained 189.96 points, or 1.8 percent, closing at 10,784.95. 
</P>
<P>
	``Several big European institutional investors have entered the  
market with buy programs,'' said Garry Evans, a strategist at HSBC 
Securities Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was up 14.22 points, or 
1.03 percent, to 1,397.39. The TOPIX ended down 1.90 points, or 
0.14 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	On the foreign exchange market, the U.S. currency was moving  
narrowly on fears of more dollar-buying intervention by the Bank of 
Japan to keep the greenback from falling further against the yen, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Bank of Japan sold yen and bought dollars to halt  
a sharp rise in the Japanese currency which was feared could 
threaten emerging signs of economic recovery here. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 123.72 yen, down  
from 125.18 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.690 percent from 1.630 percent late Wednesday, driving its 
price down to 97.51 yen from 98.02.

<HEADLINE> Two Small Quakes Jolt L.A. Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two small earthquakes rattled Los Angeles  
early Wednesday night, shaking downtown office buildings. There 
were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The first earthquake had a preliminary magnitude of 3.2 and  
struck at 6:11 p.m., said Joe Frank, a seismologist with California 
Institute of Technology in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake was centered three miles south-southeast of downtown.  
A 3.0-magnitude quake -- not an aftershock -- struck 42 seconds later 
in the same region two miles south-southeast of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no reports of damage or injury, said Los Angeles  
Police Department Officer Eduardo Funes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a regular earthquake, nothing really alarming,'' Funes  
said.

	Gore Makes His Candidacy Official  
</P>
<P>
	CARTHAGE, Tenn. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore formally began his  
drive for the presidency today, promising moral leadership and 
making ``the crisis in the American family'' the centerpiece of his 
campaign. ``With your help, I will take my own values of faith and 
family to the presidency -- to build an America that is not only 
better off, but better,'' he told a hometown crowd of thousands on 
Main Street. He was introduced by his wife and one of his 
daughters. In advance of Gore's announcement, President Clinton

	Refugee Stream Into Kosovo Goes On  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Hundreds of Kosovo Liberation Army  
rebels emerged from the woods and joined thousands of ethnic 
Albanian refugees streaming into Kosovo today despite warnings of 
possible danger. Some rebels even faced down British soldiers who 
tried to disarm them. As refugees returned, the roads out of Kosovo 
were packed with Serbs -- both soldiers and civilians afraid of 
retaliation. The Yugoslav withdrawal from the zone extending from 
Pristina to the southern border was largely completed by its 
midnight deadline, except for isolated cases of soldiers in 
broken-down vehicles, NATO spokesman Maj. Lewis Garneau said today. 
White House press secretary Joe Lockhart, in Geneva with President 
Clinton, confirmed reports that NATO had given the Serbs an 
additional 24 hours to vacate that zone because of road congestion.

	NATO Works To Disarm Kosovo Rebels  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO is negotiating with the ethnic Albanian  
guerrilla army in Kosovo over terms for surrendering weapons to 
help protect fleeing Serb forces from attack, says the U.S. general 
in charge of the advancing U.S. contingent in the Yugoslav 
province. The Kosovo Liberation Army is not bound to give up small 
arms under the peace accord accepted by Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic for the withdrawal of all Serb forces and police from the 
province. But Brig. Gen. Bantz Johnson ``John' Craddock said ``We 
don't want KLA, armed KLA, in the proximity of withdrawing Serbs.

	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- U.S. Navy and Air Force planes joined  
South Korean aircraft today in patrolling over disputed waters in 
the Yellow Sea, after a high-seas shootout sank one North Korean 
gunboat, damaged five others and may have killed 30 sailors. Five 
North Korean warships stopped just outside the boundary today and 
did not try to move into the disputed waters, the South Korean 
Defense Ministry said. Entry into the contested zone by North 
Korean ships provoked yesterday's brief battle. North Korea, 
describing the situation as grave, released a statement today that 
suspended visits by South Koreans to the capital, Pyongyang, but 
not to other parts of the country.

show some following the investment trend, with tech stocks and 
mutual funds among their choices. A few powerful figures, including 
Majority Leader Dick Armey and Chairman C.W. ``Bill'' Young of the 
House Appropriations Committee, had virtually no investments, 
though they had a large say in how billions of dollars of 
taxpayers' money was spent. The top House Democrat, Minority Leader 
Dick Gephardt of Missouri, joined the ``have-nots'' -- listing only 
one investment valued between $1,001 and $15,000.

Hundreds of other people were injured. Mexico City, where two

<HEADLINE> Players Love Pinehurst Course  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- In his prime, Jack Nicklaus loved to hear  
his fellow players complain about the narrow fairways and deep 
rough at the U.S. Open. For each complainer, Nicklaus mentally 
checked off one more potential challenger. 
</P>
<P>
	At the lovefest that is the Open at Pinehurst, Nicklaus can't  
count anyone out. 
</P>
<P>
	The first Open to be played at the venerable Pinehurst No. 2 has  
drawn nothing but raves from players who not only love the Donald 
Ross design, but are excited that Open officials did little to 
trick it up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of all the U.S. Opens I've ever played, this course is 100  
percent better than anything else I played,'' said Greg Norman, who 
has played 16 Opens. 
</P>
<P>
	Rough so low players can find -- and actually advance -- their  
balls, and a traditional course winding through the towering North 
Carolina pines have delighted players who feared the United States 
Golf Association would make the conditions too severe. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the treacherous slopes that force balls not hit in exactly  
the right place off the greens haven't drawn criticism from players 
respectful of the role Ross had in designing them 92 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got that many fellows that are happy with the golf  
course, there must be something wrong,'' Nicklaus said. ``But I 
enjoy it too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The relative lack of rough and rain that threatens to fall much  
of the week figure to combine for some low scores in the first few 
rounds, until the greens dry out and the USGA retaliates with pin 
positions put on precarious slopes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what is going to happen Thursday is one of this field  
is going to play very well and score very well,'' Colin Montgomerie 
said. ``One of these players is going to have a very good day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether a player has enough good days to threaten the Open  
record of 8-under held by Nicklaus and Lee Janzen is doubtful. But 
it is clear this Open will be different than many that preceded it. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of hacking balls out of the rough back onto fairways,  
players will be able to shoot for the greens. The problem won't be 
getting to the green, but figuring out how to keep the ball on the 
putting surface. 
</P>
<P>
	``The golf course from tee to green is very simple,'' Tiger  
Woods said. ``It's around the green where it becomes complicated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players have spent much of their practice time dropping balls in  
various areas around the greens, trying to figure out how to chip 
or putt the ball onto a missed green. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods was practicing his little 3-wood chip from just off the  
green, while other players were experimenting with anything from a 
3-iron to a sand wedge to a putter on the shaved surfaces 
surrounding the greens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think these are more difficult greens than Augusta's, the  
way they've got it done,'' Nicklaus said. ``These are the smallest 
playing large greens I've ever seen. There's really not much out 
there to play to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The comparisons to Augusta National haven't been lost on the  
players, who see similarities between the toughness of the greens 
on the two courses. 
</P>
<P>
	Toughness aside, though, the only common factor the two courses  
have is that it will take someone with a very special short game to 
win on each. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any course like this,'' Montgomerie  
said. ``There's the odd upturned saucer green on golf courses, and 
there might be even a third, even six of them. But not 18 of 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Light rain fell most of the day Tuesday, softening the greens a  
bit and allowing players to aim directly at more pins. 
</P>
<P>
	But the practice pairing of Nicklaus, Larry Mize, Fred Funk and  
Billy Mayfair found out quickly that firing at the pins is not the 
smartest thing to do at Pinehurst. 
</P>
<P>
	On the par-4 second hole, only Nicklaus managed to hit the ball  
on the green, and only because he landed it 20 feet short out of 
the rough and it ran on. The other three players all hit in the 
middle of the green, only to watch their balls roll off the back of 
the green into a collection area. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any player who thinks he can fly the ball all the way to the  
pin is going to have 20 to 25 feet coming back,'' course 
superintendent Paul Jett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman made his first trip around the course quickly, playing by  
himself and playing through a group that included Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't need to linger to know what he liked, though.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am absolutely in love with this golf course,'' Norman said.  
``It's truly magnificent. Preparation wise, there's not one bad 
hole out there.''

<HEADLINE> Libbey Raises Offer To Buy Oneida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- Glassware maker Libbey Inc. is taking  
another shot at becoming the leading supplier of tabletop products, 
increasing its offer to acquire rival Oneida Ltd., the world's 
largest maker of silverware. 
</P>
<P>
	Libbey's offer Wednesday of $625 million, or $37.50 per share,  
tops last month's bid of $500 million, or $30 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our enhanced proposal represents an unprecedented opportunity  
to maximize value for Oneida shareholders,'' Libbey Chairman John 
F. Meier said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ability to compete in a global market and offer greater  
service and convenience to our mutual customers would certainly be 
enhanced through the combination,'' Meier added. 
</P>
<P>
	Oneida, which said Wednesday it will consider the deal, has  
overwhelmingly refused earlier offers from Toledo-based Libbey, the 
market leader in glassware. Libbey wants Oneida's board to respond 
to the latest offer by June 29. 
</P>
<P>
	At Oneida's shareholders meeting on May 26, chairman William  
Matthews said the company would do better on its own than it would 
by accepting a buyout offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies want to become complete suppliers of tabletop  
products: silverware, glassware, china, linen and other 
accessories. Their fierce rivalry has taken them into federal court 
with lawsuits and counter suits. 
</P>
<P>
	After unanimously rejecting last month's offer, Oneida's  
directors took out full-page advertisements in newspapers 
expressing opposition to the unsolicited bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Libbey believes the merged companies would be more competitive  
and has promised to continue its attempts to buy Oneida, which has 
4,700 employees worldwide and is based in Oneida, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies are virtually equal in size, but Oneida has become  
vulnerable to a takeover in the last year as it has gone through a 
major restructuring following a 30 percent drop in earnings in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies have combined annual sales approaching $1  
billion. Libbey's sales totaled $437 million and Oneida's $466 
million last year.

<HEADLINE> Energy Dept. Names Security Czar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson today named a  
four-star Air Force general as ``security czar'' with broad 
responsibility over the nuclear weapons program, including research 
labs that have been a major target of espionage for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Air Force Gen. Eugene Habiger, former commander of the  
U.S. Strategic Command, will take over as the energy department's 
top security official July 6 and report directly to the energy 
secretary. The command has responsibility over all Air Force and 
Navy nuclear forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, who last month said he was looking for a senior  
military officer to head security, said that Habiger would have 
authority to ``rebuild the entire department's security and 
cybersecurity apparatus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate action, Richardson said he was ordering a two-day  
``security standdown'' at the department's three nuclear weapons 
labs -- Los Alamos, Livermore and Sandia -- later this month to 
examine security activities and ``deal with some of the problems'' 
that have been highlighted in two recent critical reviews of the 
department's anti-espionage and security system. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said all activities at the three labs would halt on  
June 21-22. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week a panel of intelligence experts said the  
energy department had a ``culture of arrogance'' and was 
``incapable of reforming itself'' when it came to security. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel of the president's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board  
urged creation of a largely autonomous agency within the department 
to deal with nuclear weapons programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson reiterated his opposition to such a proposal and said  
it was ``not good logic'' to insulate the defense programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Habiger spent 35 years in the Air Force beginning as an enlisted  
man and retiring as a full general. As commander of the Strategic 
Air Command he had control over all of the nation's nuclear 
arsenal. He also was a former B-52 bomber pilot during the Vietnam 
War.

<HEADLINE> Falsely Accused Inmate Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JONESBORO, Ga. (AP) -- The day he was wrongly convicted of rape,  
Calvin Johnson stood firm and told the judge, ``As God is my 
witness, you've got the wrong man.'' He served 16 years of a life 
sentence, believing one day he'd be exonerated. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was freed Tuesday after DNA evidence proved he could not  
have committed the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see any reason to harbor any bitterness,'' Johnson  
said as he left the Clayton County courthouse with his father and 
two sisters. ``If you hold something like that inside you, it just 
destroys you. Now it's time for me to go on with my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 41, started by shaking hands with the prosecutor who  
put him away in 1983. ``Thank you, sir,'' he said to District 
Attorney Bob Keller, who agreed to drop the charges rather than 
have a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson also grinned as he was handed the pen the judge used to  
sign the order that set him free. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believed, in some kind of way, the truth would come out,''  
said Johnson, who wore a stubby necktie and clutched a pocket-sized 
Bible. He planned to visit his mother in the hospital, where she is 
recovering from a stroke, and then start looking for a job. 
</P>
<P>
	Keller said one reason he agreed to let Johnson go was that he  
could not track down the victim. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the right thing to do under these circumstances,'' Keller  
said. ``The bottom line is, based on the evidence we've got, he 
should not be prosecuted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was represented by lawyers Peter Neufeld and Barry  
Scheck, whose group, the Innocence Project, seeks DNA testing for 
convicted rapists and murderers who insist they're innocent. The 
attorneys also represented O.J. Simpson during his murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Neufeld said Johnson is the nation's 61st inmate exonerated by  
DNA testing. He praised prosecutors for their cooperation in 
getting the tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe they have demonstrated a tremendous amount of  
courage coming forward ... to correct what has no doubt been a 
terrible, tragic miscarriage of justice,'' Neufeld said. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1983, Johnson was charged with two rapes committed  
within three days of each other in Clayton and Fulton counties. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clayton County victim said she was raped and sodomized by a  
man who broke into her apartment while she was sleeping and 
tightened a belt around her neck until she passed out. 
</P>
<P>
	She identified Johnson as her attacker from a lineup of six  
photographs. Johnson's picture was included because he fit the 
victim's general description of a black man with a medium build. 
And he'd been convicted of burglary in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Four witnesses -- including the white victim -- identified Johnson  
as the rapist based on his build and the sound of his voice. None 
of the witnesses saw the attacker's face, Keller said. An all-white 
jury convicted him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fulton County jury -- made up of whites and blacks --  
acquitted him in the second rape. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson says he's convinced race played a role in his  
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, he filed his first request for DNA tests in hopes of  
winning a new trial. Prosecutors still had evidence, including a 
semen sample, taken after the attack. They had saved it from a 
trash can where it had been discarded by a judge's clerk who was 
cleaning out his office, Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's father, Calvin Sr., asked Keller if he remembered the  
way his son insisted on his innocence the day he was convicted. The 
prosecutor said he did and recited the words Johnson spoke that 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a 16-year tragedy and I'm not going to celebrate. I'm  
going to go home and be quiet,'' the elder Johnson said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- Cadence Design Systems Inc., a leading  
producer of software used to develop computer chips, has agreed to 
buy OrCad Inc., which makes software for designing circuit boards, 
for $121 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Tuesday marks another major move toward  
consolidation in the electronics design software industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadence, of San Jose, Calif., and Beaverton-based OrCad estimate  
that software used in designing circuit boards, one of the basic 
building blocks of computers and other electronic products, 
represents a $700 million market. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Cadence completed its acquisition of Quickturn Systems  
Inc. for about $271 million after winning a takeover battle with 
Mentor Graphics Corp. of Wilsonville. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadence, which had $1.2 billion in sales last year, employs  
4,000 people worldwide. OrCad, which generated $47.7 million in 
sales last year, employs 260 people.

<HEADLINE> NAACP Shows Support for Black </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The head of the Florida chapter of the NAACP has asked the U.S.  
Attorney to look into whether race has played a role in the 
investigation into possible illegal activities by sports agent Tank 
Black. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter sent Wednesday to the U.S. Attorney's Office in  
Tampa, Leon Russell, president of the NAACP in Florida, said he 
wants federal prosecutors to review the activities of the NFL 
Players Association, campus police at the University of Florida and 
the Alachua (County) State Attorney's Office in Gainesville. 
</P>
<P>
	``My concern is based on the fear that race may be a motivating  
factor in this investigation and the possibility that an 
investigation that is possibly based on a desire to discriminate is 
going forward under the color of law,'' Russell wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFLPA has filed a disciplinary complaint against Black,  
accusing him of making improper contact with former Florida players 
before their eligibility expired. Campus police are investigating 
the same charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Violating Florida's agent law carries a maximum penalty of five  
years in prison and a $5,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Gator Johnny Rutledge has publicly admitted to accepting  
$500 payments from Black. Rutledge said former teammates Jevon 
Kearse and Reggie McGrew have admitted the same in sworn 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Black has denied all the allegations.  
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Rev. Jesse Jackson issued his support of Black  
through his Rainbow-Push Coalition, criticizing the NFLPA 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Berthelson, attorney for the NFLPA, did not return  
messages left by The Associated Press at his office. UF Campus 
police are not commenting on the investigation.

<HEADLINE> Housing Starts Bounce Back in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Construction of new homes and apartments  
posted a significant rebound in May, following a sharp drop the 
month before. 
</P>
<P>
	Builders started work last month on 1.676 million units at a  
seasonally adjusted annual rate, a 6.3 percent increase from April, 
the Commerce Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	May's increase follows a 9.7 percent drop in construction starts  
in April, a slightly smaller decrease than originally estimated by 
the government. That's because the Commerce Department said today 
that housing starts in April totaled 1.576 million units, a little 
bit more than previously estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in May was expected and was in line with analysts  
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing starts were up in all parts of the country, with the  
Northeast leading the way with 158 thousand units, a 16.2 percent 
increase in May from the month before. 
</P>
<P>
	The Midwest posted a 10.6 percent jump with 355 thousand units.  
The South reported a 4.35 percent increase in housing starts with 
744 thousand units and the West posted a 3.20 percent increase with 
419 thousand units. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall increase in housing starts was led by construction  
of single-family homes and came despite a 18.3 percent drop in 
apartment construction. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1.409 million new single-family housing starts posted in May  
was the highest level since December 1978, which reported 1.460 
million units, the Commerce Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	May's overall increase comes as home builders -- while optimistic  
about the prospects for home sales in the present and near term -- 
have voiced concerns about shortages of skilled construction 
workers and building materials, such as gypsum wallboard, 
insulation and brick, the National Association of Home Builders 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, home builders said they are keeping an eye on  
mortgage rates, which have been rising. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite low unemployment and high consumer confidence, sales of  
existing homes dipped in April after an all-time high in March and 
the pace of new home sales has begun to cool in recent months, a 
move that analysts have attributed to the rising mortgage rates.

<HEADLINE> Inhofe Lifts Holds on Appointees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a promise from President Clinton to  
notify senior lawmakers before making recess appointments, a key 
Republican senator said today he will stop blocking approval of 
pending nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Inhofe said in a statement the holds he placed on  
nominations were ``never designed'' to undo Clinton's ambassadorial 
appointment of an openly gay businessman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oklahoma Republican said he acted ``to uphold the Senate's  
proper role in the 'advice and consent' process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the Memorial Day congressional recess, the president  
circumvented the Senate by appointing James Hormel of San Francisco 
ambassador to Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
	Inhofe's move cut off an escalating dispute between Clinton and  
the Senate which erupted two weeks ago when the president directly 
installed Hormel to the diplomatic post. Clinton had nominated 
Hormel, a philanthropist and heir to a meatpacking forture, for the 
job in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	To protest the move, Inhofe announced he would seek to block  
every presidential civilian appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	With the ``recess appointment,'' Hormel can serve without Senate  
approval until the end of the next session of Congress - the end of 
2000. The Constitution allows such appointments when during 
congressional recesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In a June 10 conversation and in a letter the same day to  
Clinton, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott cited an understanding 
reached in 1985 between Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., and then 
President Reagan concerning recess appoints. Reagan promised Byrd 
that prior to recess breaks, the White House would inform Senate 
leaders of any appointments planned for recess. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Clinton agreed to follow the same procedure.  
</P>
<P>
	``My administration has made it a practice to notify Senate  
leaders in advance of our intentions in this regard, and this 
precedent will continue to be observed,'' Clinton wrote to Lott, 
R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	The president added that in return he expects the Senate to  
grant White House nominees ``expeditious consideration,'' unlike 
its treatment of Hormel.

<HEADLINE> Police May Have Found 'Rail Killer' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROUND ROCK, Texas (AP) -- A man arrested on a freight train  
Wednesday fits the description of a suspect in six slayings that 
happened near railroad tracks since 1997, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police stopped the train in this Austin suburb Wednesday  
afternoon after a 911 caller said suspect Rafael Resendez-Ramirez 
might be on a freight train in the area, said Mike Cox, spokesman 
for the Department of Public Safety. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the five men found on the train fit the description of  
Resendez-Ramirez and a fingerprint comparison was being done, Cox 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The individual we arrested has a snake tattoo on his left  
forearm, which is what the wanted poster says Ramirez has,'' Cox 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	All five men were arrested for trespassing.  
</P>
<P>
	A drifter from Mexico known to hop freight trains,  
Resendez-Ramirez has been wanted by the FBI in connection with five 
Texas killings and one in Lexington, Ky., since August 1997. All 
the victims were beaten to death near railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, police in the east Texas town of Hughes Springs  
said they also consider Resendez-Ramirez a suspect in the killing 
of an 87-year-old woman eight months ago. The victim was robbed and 
beaten to death in her home near a railroad track.

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Stock Markets Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian markets closed mostly higher Wednesday  
despite fears of an increase in U.S. interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tokyo shares fell amid concerns that higher U.S. rates could  
harm Japan's economy, still mired in recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese traders were awaiting consumer pricing data due out  
released later in the United States, with investors fearing that 
any signs of U.S. inflation could prompt the U.S. Federal Reserve 
to raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 71.82  
points, or 0.42 percent, to close at 17,210.18. On Tuesday, the 
Nikkei gained 0.54 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Pessimism about the health of the economy among Japanese  
institutional investors also dragged on share prices, said Kunihiro 
Hatae of Tokyo Securities Co. in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the currency market, the U.S. dollar slipped against the yen,  
trading in a narrow range as investors held off ahead of the U.S. 
economic data. The dollar bought 120.05 yen late Wednesday 
afternoon in Tokyo, down 0.10 yen from late Tuesday and below its 
late New York level of 120.40 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, blue chips rose 1.7 percent as investors shrugged  
off interest rate worries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index rose 219.71 points to close at 13,155.21. On  
Tuesday, the Hang Seng had fallen 0.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong market tends to follow interest rate movements in  
the United States because the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the 
U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hong Kong traders had apparently already taken potentially  
higher interest rates into consideration before going on their 
latest buying spree. 
</P>
<P>
	In Seoul, shares rebounded 3.2 percent after three days of  
losses -- as tensions eased over naval skirmishes between North and 
South Korea in the Yellow Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korean Composite Stock Price Index rose 25.81 points to  
829.53. 
</P>
<P>
	ELSEWHERE:   	
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Shares rose on gains in big companies. The SET index  
rose 1.22 points, or 0.2 percent, at 509.84. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Shares fell as investors cashed in on recent gains. The  
JSX Composite Index fell 8.308 points, or 1.3 percent, to 661.852. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Shares rose on speculation of major announcements  
from the prime minister. The Composite Index rose 11.98 points, or 
1.5 percent, at 791.91. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Shares rose as rumors of corporate expansion boosted  
demand for some stocks. The PSE Index rose 5.85 points, or 0.2 
percent, at 2,391.30. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Shares fell on worries over U.S. interest rates. The  
STI fell 3.03 points, or 0.2 percent, at 2,043.8. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Shares rose as investors held on to their positions  
ahead of the release of the U.S. pricing data. The All Ordinaries 
index rose 1.3 points, or 0.04 percent, at 2,942.2. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Shares rose as investors scooped up technology shares  
amid good earnings prospects. The Weighted Price Index rose 99.02 
points, or 1.2 percent, at 8,059.02. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: Shares rose on gains by local commodity stocks. The

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose Wednesday as report on consumer  
prices quieted fears of inflation, at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 5/8 point,  
or $6.25 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, fell to 6.06 percent from 6.11 percent late 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported that May consumer prices,  
excluding the volatile energy and food categories, rose a modest 
0.1 percent. Clothing and auto prices declined, while medical and 
housing costs edged higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The markets had been anxiously awaiting the report as a  
barometer of inflation after a surge in April helped prompt the 
Federal Reserve to warn last month that it might boost interest 
rates to slow the economy's growth. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader bond market, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities were up 1/8 point, and intermediate maturities were up 
between 5/16 point and 7/16 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.65 percent as the  
discount fell 0.07 percentage point to 4.53 percent. Six-month 
yields were 5 percent, as the discount fell 0.05 percentage point 
to 4.81 percent. One-year yields were 4.97 percent as the discount 
fell by 0.09 percentage point from late Tuesday to 4.73 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, was unchanged at 4.69 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 119 5/16 from 119 5/32. The average 
yield to maturity fell to 5.50 percent from 5.53 percent.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Falls, Corn Rises / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures retreated Wednesday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade, while corn futures rose and soybeans were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat futures fell amid concerns about increasing world supplies.  
Reports out of Argentina detailed increased seedings of wheat, while 
China's competing crop is said to be larger than the U.S. Agriculture 
Department currently is estimating. 
</P>
<P>
        Corn futures were lifted by reports of fresh export business  
overnight. Of all the agricultural commodities, corn sales have remained 
relatively strong throughout the year and are showing signs of strengthening 
further as economic conditions in Asia slowly improve. 
</P>
<P>
        Soybeans finished mixed, finding support on the rally in corn,  
but pressured as near-ideal growing weather took hold in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for July delivery fell 1 3/4 cents to $2.57 1/4 a bushel;  
July corn rose 3 1/4 cents to $2.17 1/2 a bushel; July oats fell 1 
1/2 cents to $1.18 3/4 a bushel; July soybeans rose 1 1/4 cents to 
$4.64 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Beef and lean hog futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while pork bellies advanced. 
</P>
<P>
        August live cattle rose.05 cent to 64.72 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .07 cent to 77.80 cents a pound; July lean hogs

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Gears Up for 2006 Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SION, Switzerland (AP) -- On trains, buses, wine bottles,  
umbrellas, even toilet paper, Sion's bid for the 2006 Winter 
Olympics is hard to miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Backed by high approval ratings and government support, the  
red-and-white logo and the Olympic rings are flourishing as 
expectations mount that this small city in southern Switzerland 
will land the biggest prize in winter sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Adolf Ogi, Swiss sports minister and president of the Olympic  
bid, says it is ``now or never'' for third-time bidder Sion, which 
first tried for the games in 1976 and lost out to Salt Lake City 
for the 2002 event. 
</P>
<P>
	Stung by their loss to Utah, the Swiss bidders polished up their  
campaign and claim to have improved their plans significantly. 
</P>
<P>
	An IOC evaluation team earlier this year gave Sion a glowing  
report, far better than its nearest rival, Italy's Turin. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the criteria are technical, it is Sion which should win,''  
says Director-General Jean-Daniel Mudry, looking forward to the 
final vote Saturday by International Olympic Committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	This provincial capital of some 26,000 people, in the Rhone  
Valley east of Lake Geneva, is the smallest Olympic center of the 
six bidders, with organizers promising a ``family atmosphere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Olympic village would be built within walking distance of  
the downtown Place de la Planta, where medal ceremonies would be 
held, and in sight of the main skiing and snowboarding venues. 
</P>
<P>
	High on the Alps above Sion, the resorts of Crans Montana and  
Veysonnaz, both regular stops on the World Cup circuit, face each 
other across the valley. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid committee boasts that 10 of the 14 Olympic venues would  
be within a half-hour drive or 25-mile radius of Sion. 
</P>
<P>
	Although many Olympic sites are already in place, major  
investments are planned to upgrade ice hockey and curling venues, 
as well as the soccer stadium that would host opening and closing 
ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ski-jump facilities would be built from scratch in Crans  
Montana, although on the site of an old ski jump. And a new 
speedskating oval is planned at Martigny, near Sion. 
</P>
<P>
	For the bobsled and luge, bidders have picked the world-famous  
Cresta run in distant St. Moritz -- a 30-minute flight, but about 7 
hours by road from Sion. 
</P>
<P>
	Cross-country skiing and biathlon events would take place in the  
Goms Valley, 56 miles and 1 1/2 hours by road east of the Olympic 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	Other well-known resorts -- including Verbier and Zermatt, whose  
famous peak, the Matterhorn, dominates the Sion bid logo -- will 
host VIPs. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials here recognize technical merits won't be the only  
factor in the choice for 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	But they insist that the corruption scandal that has engulfed  
the IOC, based in nearby Lausanne, hasn't affected Sion's chances. 
</P>
<P>
	After senior Swiss IOC member Marc Hodler last December claimed  
widespread corruption in the selection of Olympic host cities, 
local media worried that Sion's prospects suffered serious damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the emotional phase, I think the IOC members realized  
that it has nothing to do with the candidacy,'' Mudry says. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal had no impact on Sion's sponsorship efforts, he  
adds. But he regrets the fact that, under new rules, visits to bid 
cities by IOC members are banned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a shame, because the IOC members don't have the  
chance to get an idea (of the bid),'' he says. ``As for the ones 
who came last time, we would have liked to show them that we've 
improved the concept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC evaluators gave the bid high marks for environmental and  
transport credentials. They were also positive about plans to put 
most of the Olympic venues to use after the games. 
</P>
<P>
	But in this acutely environment-conscious country, not everyone  
is impressed. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Wide Fund for Nature, which also has raised concerns  
about bids from Turin and Klagenfurt, has objected to the Sion bid, 
dismissing the sustainable development plan as ``a marketing 
argument.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Remembering the $57 million deficit left by the 1992 Winter  
Games over the French border in Albertville, locals appear more 
concerned about the financing of the event. 
</P>
<P>
	And they question whether the 2,500 jobs promised for the next  
six years would remain beyond the Games, giving a permanent lift to 
one of Switzerland's less prosperous regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudry, however, identifies ``the political support and the  
support of the population, which weren't so strong in 2002,'' as 
the factors making the difference this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogi has given Sion enthusiastic backing, and the Swiss public  
seems to agree. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 67 percent voted in favor of an Olympic bid in a state  
referendum here in 1997. A poll for Swiss television in early May 
showed 79 percent in favor of the country playing host to the 
Olympics and 65 percent confident of a Swiss win.

<HEADLINE> Libbey Increases Oneida Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- Glassware maker Libbey Inc. said Wednesday  
it has increased its offer to acquire rival Oneida Ltd., the 
world's largest maker of silverware. 
</P>
<P>
	Libbey's offer of $625 million, or $37.50 per share, tops last  
month's offer of $500 million, or $30 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our enhanced proposal represents an unprecedented opportunity  
to maximize value for Oneida shareholders,'' Libbey Chairman John 
F. Meier said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ability to compete in a global market and offer greater  
service and convenience to our mutual customers would certainly be 
enhanced through the combination,'' Meier added. 
</P>
<P>
	Libbey shares closed Wednesday at $32.93 3/4, down 75 cents. Oneida  
was at $31.37 1/2, up $5.87 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Oneida, which said Wednesday it will consider the deal, has  
overwhelmingly refused earlier offers from Toledo-based Libbey, the 
market leader in glassware. Libbey wants Oneida's board to respond 
to the latest offer by June 29. 
</P>
<P>
	At Oneida's shareholders meeting on May 26, chairman William  
Matthews said the company would do better on its own than it would 
by accepting a buyout offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies want to become complete suppliers of tabletop  
products: silverware, glassware, china, linen and other 
accessories. Their fierce rivalry has taken them into federal court 
with lawsuits and counter suits. 
</P>
<P>
	After unanimously rejecting last month's offer, Oneida's  
directors took out full-page advertisements in newspapers 
expressing opposition to the unsolicited bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Libbey believes the merged companies would be more competitive  
and has promised to continue its attempts to buy Oneida, which has 
4,700 employees worldwide and is based in Oneida, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies are virtually equal in size, but Oneida has become  
vulnerable to a takeover in the last year as it has gone through a 
major restructuring following a 30 percent drop in earnings in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies have combined annual sales approaching $1  
billion. Libbey's sales totaled $437 million and Oneida's $466 
million last year.

<HEADLINE> NBA Finals Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- As Jeff Van Gundy's friend and assistant  
coach, Don Chaney saw the best and worst of his boss' fight to keep 
his job this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Trust Chaney on this one. It was painful to watch.  
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't sleeping,'' Chaney said before Game 1 of the NBA  
Finals Wednesday night. ``The guy was putting a lot of work hours 
in, and it still wasn't happening for him. It was very frustrating. 
I felt for him during that period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Knicks were 21-21 with a couple of weeks left in the  
season, Van Gundy seemed in serious danger of losing his job. He 
looked worse with every loss, took the pressure and the mounting 
failure the only way a proud coach can. 
</P>
<P>
	``The low point was when you kept hearing things about Phil  
Jackson, and you were hearing rumors that Phil already had the 
job,'' Chaney said. ``It got to the point where it was 
ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, the New York newspapers reported, ``If Jeff loses  
this game, he's fired,'' Chaney said. ``Now that's a lot of 
pressure on a coach. I thought Jeff handled it very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Late in the season, Chaney found himself in the most  
uncomfortable spot for an assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one said anything to me about taking over for Jeff,''  
Chaney said. ``I never had a conversation with anybody about that. 
And I'm very loyal to him, so I never thought about him getting 
fired. I never did. Although there were a lot of negative things, 
it never crossed my mind that they would pull the trigger on 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts  
fired general manager Ernie Grunfeld instead of Van Gundy. In one 
of the most improbable playoff marches ever, the Knicks became the 
first eighth-seeded team to reach the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to coach again, but nobody wants to coach when your  
friend gets fired,'' said Chaney, who coached nine seasons with the 
Los Angeles Clippers, Houston Rockets and Detroit Pistons. ``I want 
an independent deal where I go outside the organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the Knicks are in the finals, Chaney sees a dramatic  
difference in his boss' demeanor. When the Knicks beat Indiana in 
the Eastern Conference finals, Van Gundy's $3.5 million option for 
2000-2001 became guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He smiled the other day,'' Chaney said. ``I don't think I've  
seen him smile all year.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SPURS SOFT?:* Mario Elie defies anyone to prove the Spurs are  
soft. At least, he says they're not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying they were soft,'' said Elie, who used to battle  
the Spurs as a role player for the Houston Rockets. ``I just know 
down the stretch they weren't getting it done. I call it mental 
toughness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elie, a gritty veteran who contributed to the Rockets' two  
championships in 1994-95, has helped reshape the Spurs' image as a 
team that couldn't get physical. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just let my opinions be heard,'' Elie said. ``We're 42-6, so  
I guess I must have said something good and something truthful. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been through the wars before. This is a terrific team.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GREAT SEATS, EH BUDDY?:* The person who appeared to be farthest  
from the court in the cavernous Alamodome was Kennth Lyles, a 
43-year-old teacher from Houston. He called up, got tickets and 
drove to the game -- even though the seats were in the far reaches 
of the upper deck, barely in the sightline of the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``The view's not real good right now,'' said Lyles, who paid $50  
for his seat. ``But as soon as we get the binoculars, hopefully 
it'll get pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd promised to be one of the largest in the history of  
the NBA Finals. The record is 41,732 for the Los Angeles Lakers at 
Detroit on June 16, 1988.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Witness Is Friend, Critic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A long-time ally of Microsoft who was the  
company's next-to-last witness in its antitrust trial proved both 
friend and critic today. 
</P>
<P>
	In the course of defending the software giant, Gordon Eubanks of  
Oblix Inc. also heaped praise on an arch-rival to Microsoft's Bill 
Gates, characterized Windows as yesterday's technology, 
contradicted Gates and even showed the judge a handheld computer 
with software that noticeably wasn't from Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft wanted Eubanks to explain to U.S. District Judge  
Thomas Penfield Jackson that consumers benefit -- even if other 
high-tech companies might not -- when Microsoft adds new features to 
its Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	He did, but he also challenged the long-term viability of  
Windows itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``The operating system technology of five years ago is not going  
to hack it in today's world,'' Eubanks said, predicting that 
software running over the Internet will be the next most popular 
wave for technology. 
</P>
<P>
	That was before the government even began its aggressive  
questioning of Eubanks in the afternoon. When Microsoft lawyer 
Steve Holley asked Eubanks about interviews in which he described 
the software giant as a ``natural monopoly'' and said ``monopolies 
are actually really good in this environment,'' Eubanks balked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought your questions were supposed to be the easy ones,''  
Eubanks said jokingly, adding that, ``I do regret using the words 
natural monopoly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By day's end, Eubanks also had acknowledged telling The New York  
Times last year that ``Microsoft did some really bad things,'' -- 
Eubanks said he will ``take credit that I slipped up'' -- and that 
Microsoft's close cooperation with his company hinged in part on it 
distributing Microsoft's Internet software. 
</P>
<P>
	It was clearly an awkward moment for Eubanks, who earlier this  
year stepped down as president and chief executive officer of 
Symantec Corp., which makes a popular anti-virus program and other 
software utilities that use Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Eubanks argued that Windows -- the software that runs most of the  
world's personal computers -- isn't impossibly entrenched. At one 
point, he showed the judge his Palm handheld computer, which 
doesn't use software from Microsoft, and argued that the Internet 
represents a tremendous threat to Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet has changed the development platform,'' Eubanks  
said. ``People aren't developing on operating systems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Eubanks said, people are writing software that runs  
within Web browsers: ``That's the platform customers want. The Web 
browser has become the platform of choice. ...Now, I think if you 
had to pick a single platform, it's the browser.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eubanks, who praised Apple Computer Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs  
as a visionary, also contended that the upstart Linux operating 
system represents strong competition to Windows. ``I'm hearing 
customers talk about it all the time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier evidence in the trial quoted Gates at a technology  
conference in April as saying that Linux's impact ``will be fairly 
limited'' and that he's never had a customer mention Linux to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Eubanks said that even as Microsoft included new free software  
tools in Windows that duplicated some sold by Symantec, his company 
was able to thrive by improving its own utilities, which continue 
to be best-sellers in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Microsoft will occasionally add things that we were doing as  
add-ons and require us to change,'' Eubanks said. ``But by and 
large, the expansion of the market by making computers easier to 
use has been the driving force for all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In court documents, the government asked the judge to force  
Microsoft to turn over e-mail about its decision to give The 
Associated Press a copy of an internal message last December from 
Gates to his company's top executives. The government argued that 
Gates wrote the e-mail message -- which the company tried 
unsuccessfully to use as evidence -- for public relations purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	In e-mail already disclosed about the episode, Gates told  
company spokesman Greg Shaw that, ``My comments are the best tool 
we have to shift the dialog (cq) and get people to understand who 
gave consumers the fair price for (Internet) browsing.'' He 
complained that ``just putting in AP doesn't have much impact, I 
think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw replied by e-mail: ``I disagree that AP was not a good  
distribution channel. ...You should know that as soon as AP broke 
we got calls from most of the major news outlets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trial was expected to resume Monday, when an economist will  
testify for Microsoft as its final witness.

<HEADLINE> More Americans Living Past 100 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At age 98, Ella May Stumpe really didn't want  
a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthritis had prevented her from recording a century of memoirs  
with her typewriter, and her friends were pushing her to buy a PC 
so she could keep writing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to buy it. I really bought it to get them to not  
bother me anymore,'' Mrs. Stumpe said. She looked at the computer 
sitting in her room and saw a ``white elephant,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years later, Mrs. Stumpe, now 103, has mastered word  
processing and has written two books, including one titled, ``My 
Life at 100.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Mrs. Stumpe, like for more and more Americans, reaching the  
century mark doesn't necessarily mean slowing down. 
</P>
<P>
	A Census Bureau report released Wednesday finds the nation's  
centenarian population overwhelmingly female and doubling this 
decade. Women living in the Midwest have the best chance of living 
to 100, the report suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than anything else, the reason I have survived to this  
age is a moderate way of life,'' said Mrs. Stumpe, who grew up in 
North Dakota, which had the 11th highest percentage of centenarians 
among its population in 1990. She now lives in Frederick, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Stumpe, who changed her diet to nonacidic foods after  
suffering an ulcer at age 30, offers advice for those yearning to 
live long: ``I do not go for the modern teen-age diet of hamburgers 
and pizza and stuff like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Census Bureau reported that its analysis of 1990 data found  
that four out of five U.S. centenarians are women. Iowa had the 
highest percentage of residents in their 100s, a tiny .0261 percent 
of the total population, closely followed by South Dakota at .0256 
percent. Three other Midwest states -- Nebraska, Kansas and 
Minnesota also finished in the top 10. The others in the top 10 
were Connecticut, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Montana and the 
District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1990 Census counted 37,306 people aged 100 or over, but  
bureau analysts believe that inaccurate birth and death records 
inflated that number and that the figure was actually closer to 
28,000, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people don't know how old they are and if you don't  
have a record and you're old you may want to be one hundred plus. 
It's kind of a magical age,'' said Victoria Velkoff, co-author of 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the bureau estimates there are now nearly 70,000  
people age 100 or older, almost double the 1990 total. 
</P>
<P>
	California, New York and Florida had the most residents past the  
century mark. But when measured as a percentage of population, 
these big states trailed those in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Tom Perls, a principal investigator for the New England  
Centenarian Study that researches aging, said genetics probably is 
the primary reason for the regional cluster of centenarians 
frequently referred to as the ``longevity belt.'' It stretches from 
Minnesota to Nova Scotia, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were genes passed down through the generations that have  
inhabited these regions that are probably excellent for getting to 
extreme old age. That's what we call a founder effect,'' Perls 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida, with the largest senior population, ranked just 23rd in  
the percentage of centenarians in its population. The Census Bureau 
suggests that's because the healthier ``young old'' may be flocking 
to Florida, while the ``older old'' return to their home states for 
family care, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska ranked last for centenarians both as a percentage and for  
total numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also echoes findings that women outnumber men among  
the very old. 
</P>
<P>
	Women age more slowly than men, Perls said, and among women, the  
onset of cancer, stroke and Alzheimer's may be delayed by 10 years. 
Elderly women also survive illness and chronic conditions like 
heart disease more often than men, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Anna Groupe, 104, of Sherburn, Minn., spends her days reading  
the local papers and her copy of ``Portals of Prayer.''	   Born in 1895 when Grover Cleveland was president, Mrs. Groupe 
doesn't know why she has lived so long. But she remembers an active 
youth of horseback riding and farm work with her German immigrant 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I drove a horse and buggy four miles to high school to get a  
high school education. I was never late because my dad always had 
the horse hitched,'' Mrs. Groupe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, Arthur, died at age 87 in 1982. She now lives with  
her 78-year-old daughter, Mildred Johnson, on the same farm where 
she grew up. ``I take care of her and she takes care of me,'' Mrs. 
Johnson said.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Y2K Bill To Hit $8 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has scrapped a  
proposal to move the federal New Year's holiday to Jan. 3 to give 
computer experts extra time to fix the Year 2000 problem. 
</P>
<P>
	With New Year's Day falling on a Saturday, advocates of the plan  
had urged the government to recognize the holiday the following 
Monday to provide an extra day to resolve problems before employees 
returned during the first work week of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	But the White House Office of Management and Budget said in a  
new report released Tuesday night that Clinton's top Y2K experts 
rejected the plan as ``unwise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It would require extensive reprogramming of systems to account  
for the change that would only add to the burden of Year 2000 
work,'' the OMB said. 
</P>
<P>
	The OMB also raised to at least $8.06 billion its estimate of  
how much the federal government expects to spend fixing the Y2K 
problem, $1.3 billion more than it predicted just three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said the increase was due mostly to the Defense  
Department's use of $1.05 billion in emergency funds set aside by 
Congress to fix the most important computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The $8.06 billion estimate includes money spent on the problem  
by federal agencies since fiscal 1996, when some of the earliest 
repair work started. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also said 93 percent of the government's 6,190 most  
important computers have been repaired, replaced or never were 
vulnerable, up from 79 percent in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 410 computer systems government-wide that aren't ready,  
most are being repaired, it said. Thirty-five computer systems are 
being replaced and 24 are being scrapped, it added. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen federal agencies said all of their most important  
computers were prepared. Ten other agencies -- including the 
departments of agriculture, commerce, energy and justice -- still 
have unfinished work. Among the systems still not ready is part of 
the FBI's automated fingerprint system, the report said, but the 
Justice Department said it should be fixed by next month. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises on Inflation Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against most major currencies  
Wednesday as a modest rise in consumer prices last month allayed 
fears that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates 
repeatedly in the coming months to fight inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0305, down  
from $1.0425 late Tuesday. During trading, the euro fell as low as 
$1.0287, nearing its lowest point ever, $1.0260, of June 7. The 
dollar also was quoted at 120.43 Japanese yen, up from 120.40 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	International traders spent the day anticipating the consumer  
price index number, speculating on the results and what that would 
mean for the Fed. The Fed already has indicated it is inclined to 
raise interest rates as the U.S. economy continues strong, creating 
fears of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have anticipated that the Fed would feel compelled to  
raise interest rates to cool off the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The core CPI number for May -- excluding the volatile energy  
sector -- showed a price rise of 0.1 percent, compared with April's 
core rate of 0.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The benign inflation report alleviated market fears of a  
series of Fed tightenings and this was dollar supportive,'' said 
Jim Culnane, a senior foreign exchange trader at Norddeutsche 
Landesbank. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising interest rates, while making a country's assets more  
attractive, make it harder for businesses to borrow and can cut 
into corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the dollar also was supported by market wisdom  
that Germany and other countries using the euro as a single 
currency won't raise their rates as they struggle to rise above 
economic stagnancy and double digit inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The inflation report also initially helped stock and bond  
markets, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 189.96 to 
10,784.95. However, U.S. Treasury bond gains slowed as other strong 
data threatened inflation-sensitive fixed income instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond traders also were worried about what Fed Chairman Alan  
Greenspan was going to say Thursday in Congressional testimony 
ahead of the Fed's policy committee meeting on June 29-30. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5483 Swiss francs, up from  
1.5311, and 1.4599 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4621. The British 
pound fell to $1.5883 from $1.5926. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on the euro's exchange rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8979 
German marks, up from 1.8762; 6.3654 French francs, up from 6.2933; 
and 1,879.70 Italian lire, up from 1,858.74.

<HEADLINE>  Greene Sets 100M Record of 9.79 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Maurice Greene finally stopped talking  
about the 100-meter world record and broke it Wednesday night with 
a time of 9.79 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old from Kansas City, Kan., shattered one of track's  
most important marks in an invitational race for the world's top 
sprinters, running on a nearly windless night in the stadium that 
will be used for the 2004 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expected it,'' Greene said. ``This is only the beginning.''  
</P>
<P>
	The previous record of 9.84 was set by Canada's Donovan Bailey  
at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, Greene's unofficial time was flashed as 9.78. The  
official time later was set at 9.79. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he hugged athletes and  
waved the banner of his track club HSI, which stands for Handling 
Speed Intelligently. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene looked around for an American flag to wave, but couldn't  
find one. He tried to call his mother with the news that he was now 
the world's fastest human, but she wasn't home, and he had to 
settle for leaving a message. 
</P>
<P>
	The last American to own the record was Leroy Burrell, who ran  
9.85 in 1994 at Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	All last year, Greene and training partner Ato Boldon of  
Trinidad &AMP; Tobago had talked about shattering Bailey's record. 
Greene's best allowable time was 9.90 and Boldon's 9.86. Greene, 
ranked No. 1 in the world for 1998, also ran a wind-aided 9.79. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Greene and Boldon said they would not discuss the  
record, but would concentrate only on winning. A record would be a 
bonus, they agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's very significant we came to the birthplace of  
track and field to break this record,'' said Boldon, the runner-up 
Wednesday at 9.86. Bruny Surin of Canada finished third at 9.97. 
</P>
<P>
	The .05-second difference between Bailey's mark and Greene's is  
the biggest drop the record has taken since the first officially 
accepted electronic record of 9.95 by Jim Hines at the 1968 
Olympics in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a special place for me,'' said Greene, who won the  
1997 world championship on the same track in 9.86, his previous 
best allowable time. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene said his next goal was 9.76.  
</P>
<P>
	Initially, Greene was planning to run only the 200 meters  
Wednesday, but he changed his mind after seeing the strong 
100-meter field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `They can't have a party without me,''' he said. ``I  
knew something was going to happen with this race. I wanted to be 
part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene began talking about the 100-meter record early last year  
after setting the world indoor mark for 60 meters of 6.39. When it 
didn't materialize, he abandoned the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month at Milan, Italy, Greene won the 100 at 10.16  
and insisted he was only concerned about the competition and not 
the clock. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not obsessed with the world record,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Greene will defend his world title at Seville, Spain, in August.  
He also will try a sprint double in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene won three consecutive 100 and 200 state titles while at  
Schlagle High School in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	He made his first national impact in 1995 when he beat Carl  
Lewis in a wind-aided 9.88 at the Texas Relays. He then finished 
second in the 1995 national championships, earning a spot on the 
U.S. team for the world championships at Goteborg, Sweden. There, 
he didn't get past the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene failed to qualify for the Atlanta Olympics, finishing  
seventh in his quarterfinal heat at the trials. He then decided to 
go to Los Angeles and work under John Smith, a former great 
quarter-miler who holds the world record for 440 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing we worked on with Maurice is having him run  
his own race,'' Smith said. ``All I did was put him in consistent 
training, the mechanics, eating habits. He's got a great work ethic 
and attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maurice knows how to compete. His biggest asset is that he  
isn't cowed by competition. On game day, he loves to match up 
against the best. ... He can be around another 10 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After winning the world title two years ago, beating Bailey,  
Greene said, ``I want to help put U.S. sprinting back on top where 
it belongs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did that Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Less than 90 minutes after setting the record, Greene finished  
second in the 200 at 20.03, behind Boldon's winning time of 19.86. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Boldon won the regular 100-meter race at 9.97.  
</P>
<P>
	Greece's Ekaterini Thanou won the women's at 10.92, and Noah  
Ngeny led a Kenyan 1-2-3 finish in the 1,500 at 3:31.32.

<HEADLINE> All Nippon, Lufthansa Talk Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo-based All Nippon Airways and the German  
airline Lufthansa are in talks to begin sharing air routes in their 
home markets, an ANA spokeswoman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The two air carriers are discussing sharing up to nine of ANA's  
routes in Japan and 15 flown by Lufthansa in Europe, said 
spokeswoman Kate Opekar. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Asahi newspaper said the talks may be concluded as soon  
as next month, but Opekar said they might take longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Route sharing allows one airline to use the others' flights  
without issuing separate tickets. The number of miles flown also 
counts toward either company's frequent-flyer program. 
</P>
<P>
	The route sharing by Lufthansa and ANA was made possible by an  
agreement between the German and Japanese governments reached on 
May 27.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 172 at Midday / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved sharply higher today, drawing  
strength from a consumer price report that calmed investor fears 
about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
171.60 at 10,766.59. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also rose. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 29.42 at 1,330.58, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 
87.32 to 2,501.99. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market jumped after the Labor Department reported that  
May consumer prices, excluding the volatile energy and food 
categories, rose a modest 0.1 percent. Clothing and auto prices 
declined, while medical and housing costs edged higher. 
</P>
<P>
	On the bond market, which had been bracing for signs of  
rekindled inflation, interest rates fell further from last week's 
19-month high of 6.16 percent. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds 
quickly fell to 6.04 percent today from 6.11 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inflation was tame on virtually all fronts, with some key  
prices actually falling,'' said Sherry Cooper, chief economist at 
Nesbitt Burns, calling the market's advance a ``relief rally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The markets had been anxiously awaiting today's report as a  
gauge of inflation in the prospering economy. A surge in April's 
Consumer Price Index helped prompt the Federal Reserve to warn it 
might boost interest rates, and traders have been expecting an 
increase at the next meeting of the Fed's policy-setting Open 
Market Committee on June 29-30. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, the annual rate of inflation felt by consumers  
is 2.6 percent, compared to a 1.6 percent rise for all of 1998, the 
smallest in a dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks enjoyed robust gains today. America Online  
rose 12 11/16 to 106 3/4, and Oracle rose 6 7/8 to 32. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com rose 11 1/2 to 108 after the Internet superstore  
announced it would invest about $45 million in a 1.7 percent stake 
in the posh auction house Sotheby's. The centerpiece of the 
alliance will be a jointly run Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered declining by a 2-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 391.7 million shares, 
up from Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 10.19 at 632.47, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was up 6.33 at 770.25.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Surge As Dow Gains 189.96 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks soared Wednesday as steadying consumer  
prices calmed the market's jitters about encroaching inflation. The 
Nasdaq composite index, buoyed by recovering technology shares, 
achieved its largest one-day point gain. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 189.96 to 10,784.95,  
its best one-day gain since May 3, when it rose 225.65. 
</P>
<P>
	Boosted by strong earnings from business software maker Oracle,  
the Nasdaq composite shot up 103.16 to 2,517.83, surpassing its 
previous record for a one-day point gain of 96.05, set Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 29.25 to 1,330.41.  
</P>
<P>
	The markets steadily advanced after the Labor Department  
reported that May consumer prices, excluding the volatile energy

	A surge in April's Consumer Price Index helped prompt the  
Federal Reserve to warn last month that it might boost interest 
rates to slow the economy's growth. Traders have been expecting an 
increase at the next meeting of the Fed's policy-setting Open 
Market Committee on June 29-30, and stock investors have been 
worried about the effect higher rates would have on corporate 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's CPI number increases the likelihood that if and when  
we get a Fed tightening, it's more likely to be a one-time event 
vs. a series of tightenings,'' said Charles White, president 
portfolio manager at Avatar Associates. ``It by no means indicates 
that we're out of the woods yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, the annual rate of inflation felt by consumers

percent, down from 6.11 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks enjoyed robust gains, led by Oracle and  
America Online. 
</P>
<P>
	Oracle closed up 7 13/16 at 32 15/16 after reporting a 31  
percent increase in quarterly earnings Tuesday. The earnings 
performance lifted investors' spirits, said White. ``This is a 
group frankly that's been beaten up recently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America Online rose 11 3/4 to 106 1/2.  
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com closed up 15 3/16 at 111 11/16 after announcing it  
would invest about $45 million in a 1.7 percent stake in the posh

</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13-to-7 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,998 up, 1,055 down and 510 
unchanged.

<P>
	NYSE composite volume totaled 968.94 million shares, vs. 842.40  
million Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> US Soccer Player Adjusts to New Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINSVILLE, N.J. (AP) -- Sorry, folks, there won't be any  
streaking by Briana Scurry this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry, the veteran goalkeeper for the U.S. women's soccer team,  
won't be making any naked dashes through the streets outside the 
Rose Bowl if the Americans win the World Cup. She won't be matching 
her nude run after the U.S. gold medal at the 1996 Atlanta 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time, I'll be ordinary and keep my clothes on,'' Scurry  
said with a laugh Tuesday following the U.S. team's practice 
session in preparation for Saturday's opening game against Denmark 
at Giants Stadium. ``That was just a weird thing, a weird 
promise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after the Americans beat China 2-1 in Athens to win the  
Olympics, Scurry made a short scurry while stark naked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, I took my clothes off in a car and ran down the street  
and ran back, and I have proof. I videotaped it,'' she said. ``I 
ran about 20-30 feet down the road. It was a little nerve-racking. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very funny and one time only.''  
</P>
<P>
	How about if the rest of the team agreed to join her in a  
similar celebration in Pasadena, Calif., on July 10 if the favored 
Americans take their second world title? 
</P>
<P>
	``Trying to get them to do that would be like pulling teeth,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry isn't exactly the most overworked goalie in the world.  
She's played in 89 internationals and can't count how many were 
easy affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, she'll take six more games in which she could stretch  
out on a lounge chair and watch the Americans control play. And, of 
course, she knows that won't happen in this tournament, which 
should be the most competitive in women's soccer history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love it! When my team is down in the other end, I love it,''  
said Scurry, 27, who is 10-2 this year, allowing only eight goals 
and getting six shutouts. ``It's fine with me if we are dominating. 
I couldn't have a bigger smile on my face. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult at times when another team gets a breakthrough,  
but I'm trained to handle tough shots when they come at me. The 
more bored I am, the better. I'd like to be bored out of my tree 
for the whole World Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don't count on it. The Americans know they will have to count on  
Scurry to come up with a key save at some point in the tournament. 
There is no lack of confidence that she'll make that stop. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's done it for us when we've needed it,'' defender Carla  
Overbeck said. ``Bri is one of the best goalies in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry might not say that, but she certainly appreciates hearing  
it. She readily admits she doesn't measure up with some other 
goalies in two specific areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I'm as strong with my footwork as some others,  
and that's because I never played much in the field,'' she said. 
``I've been nothing but a goalie since I was 16, and I hardly got 
into the field before that, even when I wanted to and we were ahead 
by five or six goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm also not as strong with my kicks as some of the Europeans.  
But I think I can hold my own with anyone as an all-around 
goalie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What she really wants is to be the World Cup-winning goalie,  
even if she isn't best keeper in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great we have so much talent and character on this  
team,'' Scurry said. ``Because of that, sometimes I have a very 
easy job.''

for $15 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Courtin Manhattan  
accuses HBO of misappropriating MasterCard's popular ad campaign on 
which it has spent more than $300 million to date worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The MasterCard campaign, which debuted in October 1997, lists  
the costs of things you can buy with the card but typically ends 
with an experience that cannot be defined by dollars and cents. 
</P>
<P>
	More than two dozen different commercials have appeared as part  
of the campaign. One showed a group of youngsters attending a 
baseball game. The ad listed how much it cost for programs, food 
and souvenirs but then called their ``first big league ballgame: 
priceless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some things money can't buy. For everything else  
there's MasterCard,'' the ads typically end. 
</P>
<P>
	HBO, the pay television network owned by Time Warner Inc., used  
the same format in print advertising earlier this year for 
``Arliss,'' its comedy series about a greedy sports agent. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Arliss'' ad listed prices for what an agent can make for  
signing a No. 1 draft pick and for negotiating shoe contracts but 
calls ``Having no scruples: priceless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some men money can't buy. Arliss isn't one of  
them,'' the ad said. 
</P>
<P>
	MasterCard's lawsuit accused HBO of ``knowingly and willfully  
misappropriating'' its copyrights and trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Flanagan, senior vice president of marketing for  
MasterCard, said the advertiser has a sense of humor and has gone 
along with the joke when late-night hosts David Letterman and Jay 
Leno have created parodies of the ad campaign on their shows. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said it is different when someone takes the idea for the  
campaign and uses it for commercial purposes to sell their own 
product. 
</P>
<P>
	HBO spokesman Henry Gomez said, ``We don't believe the ads are  
an infringement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The ads are clearly a parody and a permissible form of  
creative advertising. We feel the ads were funny. We feel certain 
HBO will prevail in this matter,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Greene Sets 100M Record of 9.79 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Maurice Greene finally stopped talking  
about the 100-meter world record and broke it Wednesday night with 
a time of 9.79 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old from Kansas City, Kan., shattered one of track's  
most important marks in an invitational race for the world's top 
sprinters, running on a nearly windless night in the stadium that 
will be used for the 2004 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expected it,'' Greene said. ``This is only the beginning.''  
</P>
<P>
	The previous record of 9.84 was set by Canada's Donovan Bailey  
at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, Greene's unofficial time was flashed as 9.78. The  
official time later was set at 9.79. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he hugged athletes and  
waved the banner of his track club HSI, which stands for Handling 
Speed Intelligently. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene looked around for an American flag to wave, but couldn't  
find one. He tried to call his mother with the news that he was now 
the world's fastest human, but she wasn't home, and he had to 
settle for leaving a message. 
</P>
<P>
	The last American to own the record was Leroy Burrell, who ran  
9.85 in 1994 at Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	All last year, Greene and training partner Ato Boldon of  
Trinidad &AMP; Tobago had talked about shattering Bailey's record. 
Greene's best allowable time was 9.90 and Boldon's 9.86. Greene, 
ranked No. 1 in the world for 1998, also ran a wind-aided 9.79. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Greene and Boldon said they would not discuss the  
record, but would concentrate only on winning. A record would be a 
bonus, they agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's very significant we came to the birthplace of  
track and field to break this record,'' said Boldon, the runner-up 
Wednesday at 9.86. Bruny Surin of Canada finished third at 9.97. 
</P>
<P>
	The .05-second difference between Bailey's mark and Greene's is  
the biggest drop the record has taken since the first officially 
accepted electronic record of 9.95 by Jim Hines at the 1968 
Olympics in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a special place for me,'' said Greene, who won the  
1997 world championship on the same track in 9.86, his previous 
best allowable time. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene said his next goal was 9.76.  
</P>
<P>
	Initially, Greene was planning to run only the 200 meters  
Wednesday, but he changed his mind after seeing the strong 
100-meter field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `They can't have a party without me,''' he said. ``I  
knew something was going to happen with this race. I wanted to be 
part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene began talking about the 100-meter record early last year  
after setting the world indoor mark for 60 meters of 6.39. When it 
didn't materialize, he abandoned the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month at Milan, Italy, Greene won the 100 at 10.16  
and insisted he was only concerned about the competition and not 
the clock. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not obsessed with the world record,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Greene will defend his world title at Seville, Spain, in August.  
He also will try a sprint double in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene won three consecutive 100 and 200 state titles while at  
Schlagle High School in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	He made his first national impact in 1995 when he beat Carl  
Lewis in a wind-aided 9.88 at the Texas Relays. He then finished 
second in the 1995 national championships, earning a spot on the 
U.S. team for the world championships at Goteborg, Sweden. There, 
he didn't get past the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene failed to qualify for the Atlanta Olympics, finishing  
seventh in his quarterfinal heat at the trials. He then decided to 
go to Los Angeles and work under John Smith, a former great 
quarter-miler who holds the world record for 440 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing we worked on with Maurice is having him run  
his own race,'' Smith said. ``All I did was put him in consistent 
training, the mechanics, eating habits. He's got a great work ethic 
and attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maurice knows how to compete. His biggest asset is that he  
isn't cowed by competition. On game day, he loves to match up 
against the best. ... He can be around another 10 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After winning the world title two years ago, beating Bailey,  
Greene said, ``I want to help put U.S. sprinting back on top where 
it belongs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did that Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Less than 90 minutes after setting the record, Greene finished  
second in the 200 at 20.03, behind Boldon's winning time of 19.86. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Boldon won the regular 100-meter race at 9.97.  
</P>
<P>
	Greece's Ekaterini Thanou won the women's at 10.92, and Noah  
Ngeny led a Kenyan 1-2-3 finish in the 1,500 at 3:31.32.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices Unchanged in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer prices stabilized in May after a  
worrisome jump the month before, easing some inflation jitters but 
failing to quiet speculation over whether the Federal Reserve will 
raise short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Falling energy prices balanced rising food costs to help keep  
the Consumer Price Index flat last month, the Labor Department 
reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, the annual rate of inflation felt by consumers  
is 2.6 percent, compared with a 1.6 percent rise for all of 1998, 
the smallest in a dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
	Core prices -- which exclude the volatile energy and food  
categories and are the most closely watched by economists -- rose a 
modest 0.1 percent as clothing and auto prices declined and medical 
and housing costs edged up. 
</P>
<P>
	The May calm came after overall consumer prices -- led by an  
energy price jump -- rose a sharp 0.7 percent in April, touching off 
inflation fears. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite May's good news on inflation, some economists still  
believe the Federal Reserve will move to raise interest rates at 
its next meeting June 29 and 30 or later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said that to justify a rate increase, the Fed may  
consider recent reports that struggling overseas economies, 
including Japan's, may be gaining strength. That could push up 
global demand, and with it, prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed may also view America's strong 4.1 percent annual rate  
of economic growth in the year's first quarter as a sign that an 
interest rate hike is needed to slow the economy, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Fed took the inflation number by itself, it wouldn't  
move,'' said Mark Zandi, an economist with Regional Financial 
Associates. ``If they put this number in the context of the April 
inflation number and all the other things that are happening in the 
economy, they probably will tighten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists said that if May's report had shown another big  
surge in inflation, there would be no doubt the central bank would 
raise rates this month. But the fact that inflation held steady 
didn't quell speculation about a Fed rate hike at month's end or 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the Fed is looking so much at actual inflation  
data than it is looking at what (Fed Chairman Alan) Greenspan calls 
potential inflation pressures,'' said David Orr, an economist with 
First Union. May's CPI report ``lowers the odds from what had been 
80 percent probability before the report to 55 or 60 percent 
probability now,'' Orr added. 
</P>
<P>
	And Paul Kasriel, an economist with Northern Trust Co., believes  
the Fed will raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point June 
30. ``What this CPI number calls into question is whether there 
will be any further increases in rates over the remainder of this 
year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of  
Manufacturers, said the new inflation report ``ought to take any 
pressure off the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market appeared to take heart from May's benign  
inflation report. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 
10,784.95, up 189.96 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month -- just days after the Labor Department reported a big  
jump in consumer prices for April -- the Fed changed its policy bias 
to lean in favor of raising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists believe Greenspan will offer clues about rate hike  
prospects in a congressional appearance Thursday. He warned 
lawmakers Monday that rising productivity alone cannot keep 
inflation under control forever. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest inflation report indicates energy prices dropped 1.3  
percent in May after a record 6.1 percent jump in April. Gasoline 
prices fell 2.7 percent after a 15 percent rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Food prices, meanwhile, rose 0.4 percent. The cost of fresh  
vegetables was up 4.9 percent and fresh fruit prices rose 1.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In other reports released Wednesday:  
</P>
<P>
	--Industrial production, making a fragile recovery from a slump  
in global demand, edged up 0.2 percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	--Construction of new housing rebounded in May, increasing 6.3  
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.676 million units 
after falling 9.7 percent in April. 
</P>
<P>
	--The 12 regional Fed banks, surveying their areas, found that  
the ``U.S. economy remains strong, with gains in activity 
widespread.'' The beige book, released by the Fed on Wednesday, 
found consumers are continuing a buying spree, manufacturing is 
recovering from a slump in demand overseas and prices generally 
remain ``well-behaved.'' But with unemployment at a 29-year low, 
labor markets remain tight and more regions are reporting wage 
pressures that can eventually lead to inflation.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Dad Sentenced for Kids' Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHELBYVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A man was sentenced to death for  
lining up his three sons and the boys' half sister and shooting 
them after he had told them they were going Christmas shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	Daryl Holton, 36, was found guilty Monday of four counts of  
first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	During the sentencing phase of the trial that immediately  
followed the verdict Tuesday, Holton refused to let anyone defend 
him. Jurors deliberated about two hours before deciding for the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``This might have been the way Mr. Holton decided to take his  
own life,'' defense attorney John Appman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The children thought they were going shopping when Holton picked  
them up on Nov. 30, 1997. Instead, they stopped by the auto body 
repair shop where he worked. 
</P>
<P>
	At the shop, 4-year-old Kayla, ex-wife Crystle Holton's daughter  
by another man, wrote a letter asking Santa Claus to bring her a 
``Tickle Me Elmo'' doll for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, police said, Holton shot each child from the back with a  
Russian-made, semiautomatic assault weapon. The bodies of Kayla; 
Steven, 12; Eric, 6, and Brent, 10, were found stacked on top of 
one another, underneath a tarp. 
</P>
<P>
	Holton went looking for his former wife and her boyfriend but  
could not find them, police said, then turned himself in. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, his lawyer argued that Holton was a caring  
father but severely depressed at the time of the slayings. Officers 
said he told them he was afraid he would never gain custody of the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Holton said at the time of the shootings that she had kept  
the children away from him after filing a protective order because 
he was abusive.

<HEADLINE> Padres' Gwynn Scratched, Has MRI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Tony Gwynn was scratched from the San Diego  
Padres' lineup before Wednesday night's game against Philadelphia 
and was sent to have an MRI exam on his left calf. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Todd Hutcheson described the move as precautionary, and  
manager Bruce Bochy said Gwynn would be available for pinch-hitting 
duty when he returned to the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to see exactly what's going on in there,'' Hutcheson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, who's 23 hits short of 3,000, felt tightness in his calf  
Tuesday night and was replaced by a pinch-hitter in the second 
inning. He was making his third start since missing 19 games 
because of a strained left calf. 
</P>
<P>
	``He felt better today than he did last night, but still had a  
little bit of tightness,'' Hutcheson said. ``He said he felt pretty 
decent out in the field (during batting practice) but still had 
that little bit of tightness. To be safe, he decided not to start 
tonight.''

<HEADLINE> Co. Prepares To Defend Fen-Phen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Lawyers for the maker of half of the diet-drug  
cocktail fen-phen, now under fire for its link to serious heart and 
lung ailments, are expected to defend the drug for the first time 
in court within a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Stallings, a Houston attorney representing drug maker  
American Home Products Corp., said the company has a strong case. 
</P>
<P>
	``All drugs have risks,'' Stallings said. ``In this case, the  
risks we're talking about were known risks and very small risks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed by the family of Mary Marisa Smith, 35,  
who died in September 1997 while trying to lose weight. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, is one of nearly  
3,200 filed against the Madison-N.J.-based company over diet drugs 
marketed as Pondimin and Redux. A North Texas case, the only other 
to go to trial, ended earlier this year with a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	This trial, the first involving a death, began June 1 and could  
wrap up by month's end. The defense is expected to begin presenting 
its case late Friday or Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Smith's family claims AHP's drug division Wyeth-Ayerst  
Laboratories downplayed the possibility that Pondimin, a brand name 
for fenfluramine, the ``fen'' portion of the combination, could 
cause primary pulmonary hypertension. PPH is an often-fatal lung 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Phentermine, the other half of fen-phen, has not been linked to  
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which had contended that evidence linking the drug  
to the disease is inconclusive, counters that it supplied 
regulators and doctors with plenty of information about the 
possible lung disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue before the court is not whether the drug carried a  
risk of pulmonary hypertension ... but whether the Food and Drug 
Administration and the physician were aware of the risks,'' 
Stallings said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith family attorneys say even though the products warned of  
pulmonary hypertension, the company downplayed the potential 
problem and duped the FDA into reducing the size of its warning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm extremely confident in our case,'' plaintiffs' attorney  
Tommy Fibich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say even if AHP loses the Smith case, the damage would  
be minimal. This case does not address heart-valve damage, the 
illness cited in most of the lawsuits and which was not mentioned 
on labels. 
</P>
<P>
	The valve issue is what caused Redux and Pondimin to be pulled  
from the market in September 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The damages ``would have to be an extremely large number to  
impact on Wall Street,'' said James Keeney, an analyst with ABN 
Amro. ``We think the company has reserved a lot of insurance as 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pondimin's label said there were only four cases of primary  
pulmonary hypertension associated with the drug until 1996, when 
the company revised the number to 62 associations. Eleven of those 
patients died. 
</P>
<P>
	``In retrospect, the label didn't have the correct number on  
it,'' Stallings said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said, Mrs. Smith's doctor had complete information  
even as he continued prescribing the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Stallings also said the risk of the lung disease, which the  
company estimated at 46 cases for every 1 million users, was 
outweighed by the benefits of fighting chronic obesity.

<HEADLINE> Energy Prices Tumble on Inventories  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Energy futures fell sharply Wednesday on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange as weekly inventory figures continued to show unexpectedly 
large increases in supply. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, coffee rose sharply, while gold futures fell.  
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil inventories last week increased by 4.37 million  
barrels, or 1.3 percent, according to figures supplies by the 
American Petroleum Institute. That was the largest inventory 
increase since March 12 and came as world oil producers say that 
are largely in compliance with a targeted 2 percent cutback in 
output. 
</P>
<P>
	The crude figures overshadowed the long-awaited surge in summer  
gasoline demand. The API reported demand for gasoline jumped 11 
percent last week at the same time as refinery output fell because 
of cutbacks in production runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Unleaded gasoline inventories fell 2.25 million barrels to  
223.95 million barrels. Gasoline demand, which typically surges 
after Memorial Day, had been slower than expected. The peak season 
lasts through Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude for July delivery fell 61 cents to $17.94 barrel; July  
unleaded gasoline fell 1.39 cents to 52.36 cents a gallon; July 
heating oil fell 1.78 cents to 44.31 cents a gallon; July natural 
gas fell 4 cents to $2.327 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures jumped on the Board of Trade of the City of New  
York an industry report showed U.S. inventories grew at a much 
smaller than expected rate during the slow buying period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Green Coffee Association reported stocks in the past month  
rose only by 138,000 bags weighing 132 pounds each to 2.67 million 
bags as output from Colombia -- the world's largest supplier of 
arabica beans -- slipped. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants had been expecting stocks to rise by at  
least 200,000 bags since the hot weather months normally are the 
slowest period for sales of the gourmet arabica coffee beans. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee prices also were supported by forecasts from some private  
meteorologists for cooling next week in Brazilian growing regions. 
Market participants are sensitive to chances for frost in Brazil 
because that country has had two years of bumper production and is 
the world's largest grower. 
</P>
<P>
	July arabica coffee rose 1.35 cents to $1.053 a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Gold fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid reports  
Russia is considering selling some of its gold holdings to support 
the ruble. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the Central Bank of Russia told participants at  
an international economic forum in St. Petersburg that the fiscal 
caretaker is ready to sell reserves to support the beleaguered 
currency against the dollar, although he did not say such a sale 
would ever occur. 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks put further ownward pressure on gold prices, which  
have already been depressed by Britain's announcement that it would 
sell more than half its reserves to get better-returning 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold also was pressured by the U.S. dollar's climb against the  
euro. Because gold is sold in U.S. dollars, the currency rise make 
it more expensive to buy. 
</P>
<P>
	August gold fell $1.10 to $259.90 an ounce.

<HEADLINE>  Irvin Denies He's Unhappy in Dallas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Michael Irvin denied Wednesday that he has  
demanded a contract extension or is unhappy with his role in the 
Dallas Cowboys' offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys don't know what you're talking about. You're always  
wrong when it comes to me,'' Irvin told reporters after 
participating in the team's morning workout. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspaper and broadcast reports have said for weeks that the  
33-year-old wide receiver is unhappy because owner Jerry Jones has 
not offered to extend his contract, which ends after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin, who has led the team in receiving the past eight seasons,  
also was reported to be upset about his lessened role in coach Chan 
Gailey's plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Read my lips. Not one time have I said anything to Jerry about  
a contract extension. Number two. Not one time have I ever said to 
Chan that I am disappointed about my role in the offense.''

<HEADLINE>  Irvin Denies He's Unhappy in Dallas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Michael Irvin denied Wednesday that he has  
demanded a contract extension or is unhappy with his role in the 
Dallas Cowboys' offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys don't know what you're talking about. You're always  
wrong when it comes to me,'' Irvin told reporters after 
participating in the team's morning workout. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspaper and broadcast reports have said for weeks that the  
33-year-old wide receiver is unhappy because owner Jerry Jones has 
not offered to extend his contract, which ends after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin, who has led the team in receiving the past eight seasons,  
also was reported to be upset about his lessened role in coach Chan 
Gailey's plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Read my lips. Not one time have I said anything to Jerry about  
a contract extension. Number two. Not one time have I ever said to 
Chan that I am disappointed about my role in the offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin said reports to the contrary are nothing more than  
unfounded, media-generated hype. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Sabres: Improbable Team Living Dream </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- They are a low-seeded team from New York that  
began the playoffs with little hype and only a smidgen of hope. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, their sport's biggest prize is tantalizingly close, so much  
so they can almost touch it. Their legion of believers, too small 
to count only a few weeks ago, is swelling in numbers with each 
improbable victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Move over, New York Knicks. The Buffalo Sabres also are the  
improbable team living the impossible dream in this springtime of 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres, seventh seeded when the Eastern Conference playoffs  
began in April, are tied 2-2 with the Dallas Stars going into Game 
5 of the Stanley Cup finals Thursday night at Reunion Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Think about that: The Sabres, who never have won the NHL  
championship and realistically couldn't have expected to win it a 
few weeks ago, are two victories away from hoisting Lord Stanley's 
cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretty heady stuff for a team that entered the playoffs on  
little more than a Buffalo wing and a prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, it is 2-2, and anything can happen,'' Sabres forward  
Jason Woolley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of it already has. The talent-superior Stars have outshot  
Buffalo 60-30 in the last two games and 128-75 overall, yet have 
only outscored them 9-8 in the lowest-scoring Stanley Cup finals in 
30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Only once -- for a 26-second span at the end of Dallas' 4-2  
victory in Game 2 -- has either team led by more than a goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``These games are pushing you to the limit, testing everything  
you're made of mentally and physically,'' Mike Modano of the Stars 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He also warned everyone to not expect anything different in the  
rest of this closer-than-close series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you're going to see either team score more. We  
need to understand the need to win 1-0 or 2-1,'' he said. ``We've 
had bits and pieces of a good game, but we haven't put it together 
for three periods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars, the two-time defending NHL regular season champions,  
still have two big advantages: more stars and home ice edge in what 
now is a best-of-3 series. Game 7, if necessary, would be in Dallas 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the longer the Sabres hang on, the longer the Stars don't  
put many of those shots behind hockey's best big-game goaltender, 
Dominik Hasek, the longer Dallas must wonder if Buffalo is a team 
of destiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think we are fairly evenly matched. Dallas is  
obviously a little better team than us, but if we play like a team 
I still think we can beat them,'' Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres did in Game 4 Tuesday in Buffalo, preserving a 2-1  
lead over the final half of a game decided mostly by two grievous 
Dallas giveaways. Both Sabres goals, by Dixon Ward and Geoff 
Sanderson, were unassisted. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Sabres' Jason Woolley said, every game gets bigger and  
the stakes get higher with every game in a best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we're feeling more confident,'' the Sabres' Jay McKee  
said. ``We all believe that if we play as we can, we'll win this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of that confidence emanates from Hasek, who challenged his  
teammates before Game 4 to be more aggressive and take more 
gambles, even if it forced him to face more breakaways. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek responded by stopping 30 shots and clearly frustrating the  
Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, Dallas' dressing room was littered with water  
bottles with the labels torn off -- Hasek endorses the water and his 
picture is on every bottle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is getting a little heated, and frustration is building on  
both sides,'' Modano said. ``It is time to dig in and get dirty 
because there is a huge prize on the line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas, which had 14 more regular-season victories than the  
Sabres, might get a lift Thursday from the possible return of 
scoring star Brett Hull. 
</P>
<P>
	Hull scored goals in each of the first two games before leaving  
Game 3 in the first period with a strained groin. He sat out Game 4 
against his wishes because the Stars didn't want to risk losing him 
for the series. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was doubtful last time, so he's questionable this time.  
That means he's one step away from probable,'' coach Ken Hitchcock 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hull will participate in contact drills Thursday morning before  
the Stars decide if he will play that night. 
</P>
<P>
	``This series is kind of just getting started,'' Hitchcock said.  
</P>
<P>
	No wonder the Sabres were surprised to learn that Dallas already  
has plans in place for a festive Stanley Cup championship 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been the underdogs each series now,'' McKee said. ``We  
are happy with the way things are going and we want to disappoint 
the Dallas fans by breaking down their parade.''

<HEADLINE> Arizona, Missouri Execute Murderers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *MICHELLE RUSHLO   	
</P>
<P>
	FLORENCE, Ariz. (AP) -- A man who posed as a highway patrol  
officer with his brother to rob an armored van was executed today 
for killing two guards by wrapping them in weighted bags and 
dumping them in a lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Poland, 59, died by lethal injection, more than two  
decades after the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Poland's attorney, Dale Baich, had claimed Poland was mentally  
incompetent and should not be executed. Three psychiatrists had 
diagnosed him as delusional and Poland believed he had the power to 
stop his execution by force of will, Baich said. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge ruled last week that Poland was aware he was being  
executed and why, meeting the legal standard for mental competence. 
The ruling was upheld on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Poland's younger brother, Patrick, could be executed this year  
also. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers killed guards Cecil Newkirk and Russell Dempsey by  
wrapping them in canvas bags weighted with rocks and dumping them 
in a lake. 
</P>
<P>
	The Poland brothers were dressed in fake highway patrol uniforms  
and driving a rented car outfitted with emergency lights when they 
pulled over Newkirk and Dempsey on May 24, 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	The Polands overpowered them, snatched the money and drove them  
250 miles to Lake Mead. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate execution today in Missouri, Bruce Kilgore, 38,  
who helped drag a woman into a St. Louis alley and slash her throat 
was killed by lethal injection. His accomplice was spared the death 
penalty and remains in prison on a life term.

	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A 14-year-old girl has died of burns  
suffered in the crash of an American Airlines jet at the Little 
Rock airport June 1, bringing the death toll to 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Rachel Fuller was traveling with her parents and two sisters on  
the last leg of a flight home from a European concert tour with the 
Ouachita Baptist University choir. Her father, Charles, is the 
choir director. 
</P>
<P>
	Rachel died Wednesday. She was being treated at Arkansas  
Children's Hospital and had received skin grafts. Her relatives 
were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane skidded off the end of a runway during a landing in a  
violent thunderstorm, ripped open and caught fire. Nine of the 145 
people aboard were killed that night. A 10th victim died June 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the accident is under investigation.

<HEADLINE>  Refugees Streaming Home to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In a ragged but joyous homecoming,  
thousands of refugees burst through the borders separating their 
tent cities from Kosovo on Wednesday, overwhelming officials who 
gave up trying to count them -- let alone stop them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav army pulled its last troops out of the Kosovo  
capital of Pristina, and panicked Serb civilians bought and fought 
their way onto buses heading out of the province. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. commanders, meanwhile, had to threaten force to persuade  
200 ethnic Albanian rebels to turn over their weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy Capt. Mike Doubleday said NATO peacekeepers have come upon  
or heard about 90 suspected mass grave sites since entering Kosovo 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The rush of refugees came despite warnings from aid workers that  
Kosovo wasn't safe enough for them. Roads were clogged almost to a 
standstill across much of southern Kosovo -- and 12 miles back into 
Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	The movement was reminiscent of the rush out of Kosovo after  
NATO began bombing Yugoslavia on March 24 and severe violence 
against ethnic Albanians started: tractors piled high with 
belongings, old cars with children stacked two to a lap, flopping 
mattresses tied on top. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, though, people were smiling.  
</P>
<P>
	``When NATO came, it was like God came,'' said Ani Thaci, packed  
shoulder-to-shoulder in a flatbed trailer with nine relatives. ``We 
are healing already, because the peacekeepers are here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At one border crossing, officials counted 1,000 people an hour  
moving through. By late morning the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe gave up trying to count. The U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees asked NATO to help control the flow. 
</P>
<P>
	The UNHCR said 11,600 people had crossed Wednesday, including  
all 8,500 people from a refugee camp run by the United Arab 
Emirates. But the numbers seemed low; reporters saw tens of 
thousands lined up on the Albanian side of the border, waiting to 
cross into Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once this thing gathers momentum there's a snowball effect and  
you can't stop it,'' said UNHCR spokeswoman Judith Kumin. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials began to try to help the refugees who defied their  
warnings to remain in the camps, setting up two waystations on the 
road to the Kosovo city of Prizren and towing broken down cars off 
the road to prevent the traffic from getting any worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbs, meanwhile, continued to stream north out of Kosovo --  
either Yugoslav soldiers departing under terms of the peace deal or 
civilians afraid of retaliatory attacks. Some 860,000 ethnic 
Albanians that made up Kosovo's 2.1 million prewar population fled 
beginning in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb civilians desperate to leave tussled among themselves at  
the Pristina bus station, clamoring to get on buses and offering 
wads of cash for a seat. Soldiers were seen hitchhiking on roads 
heading north. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Bishop Artemije of the Serbian Orthodox Church, who had  
urged Serbs in Kosovo's second-largest city to remain, joined their 
flight. Under armored escort by German peacekeepers, the bishop and 
a number of Serb families left Prizren for Pristina, the German 
command said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of the city's last ethnic Serb residents followed  
within hours, as refugees on their way back into Prizren jeered and 
laughed at them. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, evidence of Serb atrocities in Kosovo continued to  
mount. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bruznik in central Kosovo, raw earth was marked with small  
wooden stakes and paper tags numbered one to 60. Each paper also 
was marked June 4 or June 5 -- days after President Slobodan 
Milosevic accepted an international peace proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic and four senior associates were indicted on war crimes  
charges in The Hague last month. 
</P>
<P>
	In Berisht, just north of Pristina, residents said a shallow  
grave held the bodies of at least 60 people. Dozens of large 
plastic bags lying near the grave appeared by their size and odor 
to contain more bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	And villagers in Vlastica, southeast of Pristina, told soldiers  
about a grave containing the bodies of 13 people they said were 
killed on April 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance's commander, Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson, called on  
all Serbs to stay in Kosovo, telling Serbs in the village of Kosovo 
Polje the troops ``would have the same attitude toward everyone,'' 
the independent Belgrade news agency Beta reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The state-run Tanjug news agency said all Yugoslav army units  
had left Pristina although NATO extended a midnight Tuesday 
deadline by 24 hours because traffic jams slowed the movement. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials, however, said a few were allowed to stay behind  
for the time being to repair broken vehicles and coordinate troop 
movements. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Robin Clifford, a spokesman for the allied force, said  
26,000 of the 40,000 or so Serb troops in Kosovo had left. Under 
the peace accord that ended the 78-day NATO air campaign, all Serb 
forces are to be out of the province by Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The American contingent in Kosovo rose to more than 3,000  
soldiers, along with 5,000 British and Canadian forces, 4,000 
German and Dutch troops, 2,000 Italians and 1,500 French. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50,000 allied forces, including 7,000 Americans, are  
expected to keep the peace in five sectors of Kosovo. Russia, a 
longtime Serb ally, is hoping to be given a sector to command, too, 
but NATO opposes that. 
</P>
<P>
	Marines from Company K, Battalion Landing Team 38, meanwhile,  
came across 200 rebel fighters who refused to turn over their 
weapons near the farming village of Zegra, 30 miles southeast of 
Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Commanders had to threaten to call in Cobra attack helicopters  
before the rebels relented, Capt. David Eiland said. The Marines 
led away six leaders of the group in handcuffs. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	In Helsinki, Finland, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen began  
two days of talks with his Russian counterpart, Igor Sergeyev, in 
an effort to resolve a standoff between NATO and 200-300 Russian 
soldiers who arrived unannounced in Kosovo on Saturday and are 
holed up at Pristina's airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergeyev predicted the issue would be resolved by the weekend.  
</P>
<P>
	The rebel spokesman in Pristina, Jakup Krasniqi, warned that the  
Russians ``will be unwelcome here, and we will treat them as enemy 
forces.''

</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Robin Clifford, a spokesman for the allied force, said  
26,000 of the 40,000 or so Serb troops in Kosovo had left. Under 
the peace accord that ended the 78-day NATO air campaign, all Serb 
forces are to be out of the province by Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The American contingent in Kosovo rose to more than 3,000  
soldiers, along with 5,000 British and Canadian forces, 4,000 
German and Dutch troops, 2,000 Italians and 1,500 French. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50,000 allied forces, including 7,000 Americans, are  
expected to keep the peace in five sectors of Kosovo. Russia, a 
longtime Serb ally, is hoping to be given a sector to command, too, 
but NATO opposes that. 
</P>
<P>
	Marines from Company K, Battalion Landing Team 38, meanwhile,  
came across 200 rebel fighters who refused to turn over their 
weapons near the farming village of Zegra, 30 miles southeast of 
Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Commanders had to threaten to call in Cobra attack helicopters  
before the rebels relented, Capt. David Eiland said. The Marines 
led away six leaders of the group in handcuffs. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	In Helsinki, Finland, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen began  
two days of talks with his Russian counterpart, Igor Sergeyev, in 
an effort to resolve a standoff between NATO and 200-300 Russian 
soldiers who arrived unannounced in Kosovo on Saturday and are 
holed up at Pristina's airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergeyev predicted the issue would be resolved by the weekend.  
</P>
<P>
	The rebel spokesman in Pristina, Jakup Krasniqi, warned that the  
Russians ``will be unwelcome here, and we will treat them as enemy 
forces.''

<HEADLINE> Norman Doesn't Fret About Shortfall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- This time, Greg Norman wants to remember.  
</P>
<P>
	He may have come up short at the Masters, but shed no tears for  
this often-pitiable figure. When he looks back on his third-place 
finish at Augusta National, it brings a smile to his tanned face. 
</P>
<P>
	``Augusta helped in a lot of ways,'' Norman said Wednesday after  
his final round of practice for the U.S. Open, latest stop in his 
two-decade-long quest for a major title on American soil. ``When I 
think back to some of the shots that I hit at Augusta, I hit a lot 
more good shots than I did bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norman hasn't hit many shots -- period -- since finishing three  
shots behind Jose Maria Olazabal at the Masters. Between taking 
time off for a fishing vacation and tending to his various business 
interests, the Shark has played in just three events over the past 
two months. 
</P>
<P>
	The week after the Masters, he finished 68th at the MCI Classic.  
Norman skipped the next six tournaments before returning to play at 
the Memorial, where he struggled to a 69th-place showing. Last 
week, he was well off the lead when he withdrew from the 
rain-delayed St. Jude Classic prior to the final round, preferring 
to return home and begin focusing on the Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he has managed only three rounds below par in his  
last three events, Norman placed himself among 30 or so players 
with a chance to win at Pinehurst No. 2. He has been focusing on 
the putter, the weakest part of his repertoire since Augusta. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state of my game is good,'' Norman insisted. ``My level of  
confidence is good. Not way up there, because I haven't been 
playing a lot of golf. But all in all, I feel very comfortable 
about my approach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His positive outlook can be attributed to the very un-Openlike  
conditions at the Donald Ross-designed course, nestled among the 
pine trees in the rustic North Carolina sandhills. 
</P>
<P>
	The rough isn't as high as usual, the fairways are wider than  
expected and the slick, wavy greens would get a seal of approval 
from Augusta National. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pleasure to play this golf course,'' Norman said.  
``I've played very few golf courses on the PGA Tour that challenge 
you in every aspect of the game, from putting all the way down to 
the driver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norman was sitting at home a year ago when the Open was held at  
the Olympic Club in San Francisco. With his shoulder just two 
months removed from major surgery, he could hardly bear to watch a 
major tournament on television. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was at Olympic, wasn't it?'' Norman said, trying to  
remember Lee Janzen's victory. ``I did watch a little of it. Not a 
whole lot. You don't like sitting out major championships. You like 
to be in the thick of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norman has been in the thick of things for 20 years, placing  
among the top-10 in a staggering 28 major tournaments. But his 
sustained run of excellence has been rewarded with only two British 
Open titles. 
</P>
<P>
	On this side of Atlantic, Norman's woes are epitomized by his  
collapse in the 1996 Masters, when he squandered a six-stroke lead 
to Nick Faldo in the final round. But the U.S. Open has also 
yielded its share of misery, too, including two of his eight 
runner-up finishes in major tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	At Winged Foot in 1984, Norman made a 40-foot putt on the final  
hole, prompting Fuzzy Zoeller to wave a white towel in mock 
surrender. Alas, it was not a birdie as Zoeller thought, but merely 
a gutsy putt to save par and force an 18-hole playoff the following 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Zoeller regained the momentum, shot a 67 and routed Norman by  
eight shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, Norman was in the running for another Open title  
at Shinnecock Hills until he bogeyed the next-to-last hole. Corey 
Pavin secured a two-shot victory which his famous 4-wood to the 
green at No. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman was limited to only three events last year after having  
surgery on his aching left shoulder, and his comeback was erratic 
until he arrived at Augusta as an afterthought. Playing brilliantly 
into Sunday's back nine, he held the lead with five holes remaining 
before his run was doomed by bogeys at Nos. 14 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman would like another chance this weekend to stare down the  
14th fairway in the final round, his name atop the leaderboard. He 
will do his best to remember what happened at Augusta. 
</P>
<P>
	``You think back to those shots, you think back to how you  
played them,'' he said. ``You're trying to take that feeling in. 
Any positive thinking is better than negative thinking.''

<HEADLINE> House Toughens Juvenile Enforcement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to the Colorado high school  
shootings, the House voted today to toughen law enforcement against 
juvenile offenders and debated curbs on youth access to explicit 
sexual and violent material in video games, movies and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The developments came on the eve of a showdown over gun control,  
and as President Clinton lobbied long distance for passage of 
mandatory background checks for all firearms purchases at gun 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``I urge you to stand up to the gun lobby once again,'' he wrote  
to dozens of lawmakers in a letter from Switzerland, where he was 
attending an international conference. The National Rifle 
Association has lobbied furiously for a less restrictive measure 
than the all-inclusive background checks at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Taken together, the issues marked the House's attempt to respond  
to the shocking deaths at Columbine High School in April, when two 
students killed 12 fellow students and a teacher before turning 
their guns on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Partisan tensions surfaced almost immediately.  
</P>
<P>
	Majority Republicans ``take a balanced approach to curbing  
juvenile crime and closing the loopholes in our gun laws,'' said 
Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats instantly accused the GOP of rigging the  
legislative process to do the NRA's bidding and assure the defeat 
of gun control measures approved by the Senate and backed by the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``I for one believe the welfare of our children should be put  
before partisan politics,'' said Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass. ``But 
that's not going to happen today ... because partisan politics won 
out over common sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stepped-up effort against juvenile crime was approved  
249-181. It includes a requirement that all U.S. attorneys 
designate prosecutors to specialize in firearms cases, a provision 
meant to address Republican complaints that only a tiny number of 
such cases are now prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, it calls for stricter penalties for numerous  
crimes, including illegal possession of a firearm with intent to 
take it into a school zone. Prosecutors, rather than judges, would 
have discretion to charge a juvenile as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., authored the proposed curbs on sexual  
and violent material for minors, saying they were designed to 
``slow the flood of toxic waste into our kids' minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents need our help. Let's stand with them. Nothing we do in  
this life is more important than how we raise out children,'' said 
the House Judiciary Committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal called for curtailing minors' access to pictures,  
drawings, video games, movies, books, recordings or other materials 
containing certain ``explicit sexual material or explicit violent 
material.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The measure drew the opposition of both Democrats and  
Republicans who cited concerns about the First Amendment. The 
entertainment industry also weighed in with its opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich, said the proposal was an  
``unparalleled assault'' on the First Amendment, with its 
guarantees of freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
	And Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., said Hyde's proposal would ``create  
a police force for what is decent, what is violent.... Is that a 
movie like `Home Alone Three,' is that a movie like `Ben Hur,' is 
that a movie like `Saving Private Ryan?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., hearkened back to the gun control  
debate overhanging the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The mother of teen-age children, she said she was troubled that  
under the Republicans' proposals, a clerk who sold her child 
``Shakespeare in Love'' might be subject to criminal sanctions 
while someone who sold her child a firearm would not. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's letter was dispatched to lawmakers who voted for the  
Brady Law that passed in 1993, establishing a system for checking 
the backgrounds of individuals purchasing guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under pressure from the gun lobby, some in the House have  
proposed gun show legislation that is riddled with new and 
dangerous loopholes similar to those that were defeated in the 
Senate,'' Clinton wrote. The president also telephoned at least two 
wavering Democrats from Air Force One while en route to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic aides expressed pessimism that the White House-backed  
gun provisions could prevail in the House, but Clinton's energetic 
efforts suggested he had not given up. 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., renewed his attack  
on majority Republicans during the day. ``Watching the NRA write 
the Republican proposal has been galling,'' he told a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	But the senior Democrat in the House, Rep. John Dingell of  
Michigan, was leading the charge for the NRA. 
</P>
<P>
	In brief remarks on the floor, Dingell said he was opposing  
Hyde's anti-violence legislation because it would violate the First 
Amendment. And he said he would be back in the well of the House on 
Thursday to defend the Second Amendment's right to bear arms.

<HEADLINE> Fund To Buy Low-Income Mortgages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Florida investment company has launched the  
first-ever investment fund designed to encourage banks to put more 
money in low-income neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers of the CRA Qualified Investment Fund hope that if  
bank lenders know they can sell such mortgages, they will be more 
willing to lend to businesses and homeowners in distressed areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Launched this week, the fund will buy mortgage-backed securities  
and mortgages backed by properties in low-income neighborhoods. By 
doing so, the fund aims to expand that market the same way Fannie 
Mae and the Federal Home Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., or 
Freddie Mac, have done for conventional mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides earning returns on par with Treasury securities, banks  
that put money into the fund will also be able count their 
investments against their obligations under the federal Community 
Reinvestment Act, which requires them to lend and invest in 
low-income neighborhoods from which they draw deposits. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund will ``create a much bigger and more efficient market  
for CRA securities,'' said Kenneth Thomas, a fund organizer and 
finance professor who specializes in CRA. 
</P>
<P>
	Fund spokesman Daniel Weinbach said most of the fund's purchases  
will be of mortgages for low-to-moderate-income housing, but will 
also include small business loans and municipal bonds issued to 
build a community center or fund an after-school program. 
</P>
<P>
	Started by a group of academics, community organizers and  
bankers who specialize in community lending, the fund is 
technically a mutual fund, though it is targeted to bank investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Fund organizers have also promised to plow back each bank's  
investment into its own community. If a Harlem bank invests 
$250,000, for example, then the fund would allocate $250,000 to buy 
mortgages in Harlem. 
</P>
<P>
	The Harlem bank would subsequently earn a return based on the  
investment performance of mortgages across the country, but would 
still be investing in its own community. 
</P>
<P>
	``The beauty of this fund is that banks will be able to meet the  
community development needs of the neighborhoods they serve, while 
earning competitive returns with a high measure of security, and 
without the administrative onus of tracking numerous individual 
investments,'' said David Zwick, a fund founder and the president 
SunCoast Capital Group a brokerage in Fort Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
	The new fund comes as the CRA has been under fire. Last month,  
the Senate passed legislation that would exempt small banks from 
the CRA and weaken it in other ways, according to community 
development advocates. President Clinton has said he would veto the 
Senate bill. The House is considering less stringent legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Debby Goldberg, a neighborhood reinvestment specialist with the  
Center for Community Change, called the new fund an ``interesting 
option.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've over the years heard a couple of people raise ideas like  
this, but nobody's been able to figure out how to do it,'' Goldberg 
said. ``Clearly, we're now at a place where people think they can 
make a go of it, and I think it's very exciting.''

<HEADLINE> Hingis Vows No More Tantrums </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EASTBOURNE, England (AP) -- Martina Hingis, top seeded at  
Wimbledon, promised Wednesday there would be no more tantrums like 
the one in her French Open final loss to Steffi Graf. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis smashed her racket and then marched around the net to  
dispute a line call. She also served underarm and climbed the 
umpire's chair to make another protest as came close to defaulting. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis stalked off the court after losing to Graf and was said  
to have bumped into an official of the WTA Tour before being led 
sobbing back to the court by her mother Melanie Molitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way that could happen again,'' she said at  
Eastbourne, where she is playing doubles in the grass-court warmup 
for Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still young and I hope I can learn from it,'' said the  
world's top ranked woman player. ``You can't do what I did and be 
happy about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've been raised well. I probably lost a bit of  
control of my feelings and my temper, but it definitely won't 
happen again. The rules are made for something, and I didn't 
respect them. That's not right and that's why I got what I did. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't the best behavior of course. I did things I wasn't  
allowed to do, like going on the other side (of the net), but I did 
them and these things happen. Now I just have to go on with my 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis was evasive when asked if her mother had scolded her for  
her behavior, but she said nobody else would have gotten her to 
return to the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``She understands me the best, so there's no need to talk about  
what happened,'' said the WTA Tour's No. 1-ranked player. ``She 
knows how I feel. But I knew I had to go out there. It wouldn't 
have been fair to anybody if I didn't. It would have been too 
much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis fled to the sanctuary of her home in the Czech Republic  
to escape the fury afterwards -- riding horses -- and said she saw 
none of the headlines labeling her a spoiled brat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't read any newspapers. We just cut the grass on some  
land we have there, and made a tennis court by drawing some lines, 
and played some volleys and serves and overheads.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she also sought refuge in several friends on the tour.  
</P>
<P>
	``I only care what the closest people to me say,'' she said.  
``There are not too many people telling you the truth if you're one 
of the best players in the world. But you have to respect somebody. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anna (Kournikova) and I are close and the relationship is  
building,'' she added. ``She came to me in Paris when I was crying, 
and Nathalie Tauziat also.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And what about her reception at Wimbledon -- where she won two  
years ago -- after being booed off the court in Paris? 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really know what to expect, but I don't think it (the  
jeering) will happen at Wimbledon,'' she said. ``The crowd is more 
polite and the people here at Eastbourne seem to be OK. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a way Paris was a good experience. I didn't follow the  
rules, which I will definitely do this time. Wimbledon is 
different.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Shortly before Rice's first pitch against  
Alabama, Owls coach Wayne Graham was thinking about a fellow 
baseball man back in Houston: manager Larry Dierker of the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all concerned,'' Graham said. ``I don't think there's  
anyone in Houston who doesn't like Larry. He's a good guy. He's a 
good manager.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker has been hospitalized after brain surgery earlier this  
week. During a game Sunday, he suffered a seizure in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I only know what's been in the paper,'' Graham said.  
``Obviously, everyone associated with the Rice baseball program is 
concerned about Larry. We wish him a speedy recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DELAYED PROTEST:* Rice assistant Jon Prather waited until the  
next batter before leaving the dugout to protest a call by home 
plate umpire Randy Bruns. 
</P>
<P>
	In the bottom of the fifth, with Alabama trying to extend a 3-1  
lead, Rice's Jeff Nichols threw a 2-2 pitch to Kelley Gulledge that 
Bruns determined was a ball. That ran the count full and Gulledge 
singled to left on the next pitch, scoring Phillips from second. 
</P>
<P>
	When the next batter, Sam Bozanich, came up, Prather ran from  
the dugout to argue the 2-2 pitch. Prather stomped on the left-side 
batter's box and pointed at the plate, apparently arguing the pitch 
had caught the corner. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruns ejected Prather, but Graham didn't mind.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was a good thing at that point,'' Graham said. ``It  
let the team know we wanted them to go down swinging.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DON'T WORRY, MOM:* Kay Chavez, mother of Florida State starter  
Chris Chavez, came all the way to Omaha so she wouldn't have to see 
her son pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Chavez cannot bear to sit in the stands when Chris pitches.  
It was a habit, Chris explained before the game, she developed when 
he was throwing at Washington High School in Tallahassee. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Chavez has found a spot on the Rosenblatt Stadium concourse  
where she can make a short walk to view the scoreboard. She also 
keeps track of the game on concourse televisions, but not when 
Chris is on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SCORING CHANGE:* Lou Spry, official scorer of the College World  
Series since 1981, was back in the booth Wednesday for the late 
game between Florida State and Cal State-Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
	Spry had gone home to Kansas City on Tuesday after his wife was  
hospitalized. She was treated for blood clots stemming from an 
automobile accident in April. Mrs. Spry was doing well and urged 
her husband to return to Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Wednesday, Spry had only missed two games in 1987. He  
wasn't back in time for the early game between Alabama and Rice, so 
the scoring was handled by Big 12 media coordinator Bo Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	He is no rookie. Carter scored during the 1979 CWS when he  
worked as sports information director at Mississippi State. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BARE-HANDED CATCH:* Cal State-Fullerton right fielder Chris  
Beck, who started at first, made a nice catch in the sixth against 
Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	Beck caught a fly from Kevin Cash, just not right away. The ball  
bounced from the web of Beck's glove and he caught it with his bare 
right hand. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DOUBLE DUTY:* Alabama shortstop Andy Phillips doubled in the  
first inning against Rice to extend his Southeastern 
Conference-record hitting streak to 36 games. He had a few more 
doubles left in his bat. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fifth, he had a ground-rule double over the wall in left  
and added another double in the ninth. He finished 3-for-4 with two 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips needs two doubles to tie Alabama's career record of 64,  
held by Dave Magadan of the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RECORD ATTENDANCE:* The crowd of 22,155 for the late session  
was the sixth straight session record set this year. NCAA officials 
say attendance remains on pace for a record. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ALL-STAR CATCHER:* Kelley Gulledge once played with the major  
league all-stars -- sort of. 
</P>
<P>
	When the All-Star Game was played at the Ballpark in Arlington  
in 1995, Gulledge was the catcher during the home run contest. He 
had a family connection that helped him land the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was put in charge of the home run derby,'' said Kelley's  
dad, Chuck Gulledge, who has been the Texas Rangers public address 
announcer for 17 years. ``I was told I would need a catcher and 
some ball shaggers. 
</P>
<P>
	``My son played on a high school team, so that's where I found  
the shaggers. And I already had a catcher inside my house.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FOUL BALL:* A fan was injured in the second inning between  
Florida State and Cal State-Fullerton when hit by a foul ball off 
the bat of Seminoles catcher Jeremiah Klosterman.

<HEADLINE> Going Back to Shakespeare's Roots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHLAND, Ore. (AP) -- When Mistress Quickly sweeps on stage to  
confront Falstaff about his bar bill, sharp-eyed Shakespeare fans 
in the front row might notice she has a ``soul patch'' of whiskers 
beneath her lower lip. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood may be stacking its Shakespeare revival with glamorous  
stars like Michelle Pfeiffer, Kevin Kline and Gwyneth Paltrow, but 
the Oregon Shakespeare Festival is reaching down to its roots for 
``Henry IV Part 2'': an all-male cast that not only doubles up 
roles, but takes the parts of women. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has nothing to do with historic accuracy,'' said festival  
artistic director Libby Appel, who directed the play opening June 
19 as part of the outdoor summer season. ``I think we all feel 
captured by a piece of Shakespeare that we couldn't have known any 
other way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As anyone who saw ``Shakespeare in Love'' will recall, theater  
companies in Elizabethan England were all men. Authorities 
considered it immoral for women to go on stage. So Juliet was 
played by a boy whose voice hadn't broken yet and her nurse was 
played by a man in a dress. Shakespeare's company numbered only 
about 15 actors, so they took on multiple roles. 
</P>
<P>
	With minimal scenery and costumes, Elizabethan audiences could  
recognize that men were playing women and the same actor was 
different characters. But audiences were accustomed to such 
imaginative leaps. 
</P>
<P>
	Shakespeare even discussed the issue in the chorus that begins  
``Henry V'': 
</P>
<P>
	``On your imaginary forces work. Think when we talk of horses,  
that you see them printing their proud hoofs in the receiving 
earth. For it is your thoughts that now must deck our kings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 64 years of presenting Shakespeare, the festival had never  
tried an all-male cast. But while reading ``Henry IV Part 2,'' 
Appel was struck by the idea that it was much darker than ``Part 
1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about a diseased kingdom,'' Appel said as she sat in the  
festival's open-air Elizabethan Theater for a dress rehearsal. 
``When I saw this darker canvas, I thought all-men was the way to 
go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two parts together are among the best known of Shakespeare's  
history plays, because they are dominated by one of his greatest 
characters, Sir John Falstaff. Part 1 chronicles Henry IV of 
England usurping the throne. In Part 2, the king puts down a 
rebellion and dies, passing the crown on to his wastrel son, Prince 
Hal, who becomes King Henry V, the hero of Agincourt. 
</P>
<P>
	Where Part 1 introduces Falstaff as the knight filled to  
bursting with wine and wenching, Part 2 follows him on a sadder 
journey, where he confronts old age and poverty. Prince Hal, so 
eager to join Falstaff's revels in Part 1, rejects his old friend 
and carefree youth when he takes on the responsibilities of king in 
Part 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something happens to a history play when it's all-male,''  
Appel said. ``It underscores the warlike environment. To have this 
kind of dark and cynical view played by men is very right. I think 
it presents a kind of muscle to the play. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things we discover is what those brilliant men in  
Shakespeare's company -- not the pretty boys but the character roles 
-- how brilliant they must have been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are only four women's roles. Two are comic: Mistress  
Quickly, an old tavern keeper who still loves Falstaff though he 
has ``eaten me out of house and home,'' and Doll Tearsheet, a wench 
whom Quickly sets up with Falstaff before he goes off to war. Two 
are tragic: Lady Percy, the widow of rebel leader Hotspur, and Lady 
Northumberland, another rebel leader's wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Figuring out which characters could be played by the same actors  
was like fitting together a jigsaw puzzle, festival dramaturge 
Barry Kraft said. With some last-minute juggling, they settled on 
15 men for the 43 speaking roles, which made for some contrasting 
juxtapositions. 
</P>
<P>
	G. Valmont Thomas, who plays Mistress Quickly, also plays the  
rebel knight Colville. Leith Burke plays Prince John of Lancaster, 
the king's son who quashes the rebellion with false promises, as 
well as Lady Percy, who makes an eloquent speech against war. 
</P>
<P>
	To make it easier for Michael Elich to quickly change from rebel  
leader Northumberland to Bardolph, a comic Falstaff corporal, 
costumers attached Bardolph's trademark carbuncled red nose to his 
hat. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas has played a variety of women's roles in his career, but  
decided against shaving off his soul patch for Quickly. He's not 
supposed to fool anyone into thinking he is a woman, but his 
Quickly isn't camp, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people sitting in the audience, we can't have them be  
passive,'' he said. ``They've got to be active members of what is 
going on. This, I think, will keep people working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To switch from man to woman, Thomas uses physical cues to ``find  
a different center of gravity.'' Wearing Colville's combat boots 
underneath Quickly's heavy dress, Thomas plays the tavern keeper on 
her tiptoes. Colville stands solidly with his feet apart, daring 
his enemies to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
	``You start to approach things from, `How would my grandmother  
do this?' It morphs into, `How would a woman do this?''' Thomas 
said. ``Slowly, your own woman starts to emerge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a scholar, Kraft delights in the echoes created by doubling  
up roles, making him wonder if Shakespeare wrote it that way on 
purpose to fit his company of about 15 actors. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, in the festival production, Ned Schmidtke plays  
both the reluctant army recruit Bullcalf and King Henry V. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullcalf, ``Says he has a disease, `A hoarsened cold sir, a  
cough sir, which I caught with ringing in the king's affairs on his 
coronation day,''' Kraft quoted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then the same actor a few scenes later as King Henry IV will  
say to his recalcitrant son, who also doesn't want to fight or go 
to war ..., `Bid the merry bells ring to thine ear that thou art 
crowned, not that I am dead.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Appel has had such a good time with this all-male production she  
might do another, but certain plays will be off-limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lady Macbeth should be a woman,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Further Tornado Research Necessary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Continued spending on scientific research is  
needed to learn more about tornadoes, though new technologies have 
improved the ability of weather forecasters to predict and warn 
about them, researchers told a House panel Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress should continue to support basic research so that  
those of us involved in those kinds of activities can continue to 
make progress,'' said Howard Bluestein, a professor of meteorology 
at the University of Oklahoma in Norman. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of extremely violent tornadoes killed at least 50 people  
and injured hundreds more in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas and Tennessee 
on May 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis McCarthy, the meteorologist in charge of the National  
Weather Service Forecast Office in Norman, Okla., said his office 
issued 116 county warnings for tornadoes and severe thunderstorms, 
with an average lead time of 18 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	He said officials were encouraged by the experiences but that  
forecasters need to gain a better understanding of tornadoes and 
thunderstorms in order to improve their forecasting and increase 
warning times for the public. 
</P>
<P>
	``Better science will lead to more accurate warnings,'' McCarthy  
told a joint hearing of the basic research subcomittee and energy 
and environment subcommittee of the House Science Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Those tornadoes came from what is called a ``supercell'' -- a  
thunderstorm that brings extreme severe weather, such as large hail 
and strong tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
	But not all supercells produce tornadoes. They can be created by  
regular thunderstorms too, and the researchers said they are 
working to understand why some storms lead to twisters and other 
kinds do not. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Nick Smith, R-Mich., chairman of the panel on basic  
research, said that despite the scientific advancements, storms 
still develop in a moment's notice. He also said that tornado 
warnings don't always reach the public. 
</P>
<P>
	``We appear to be getting closer to solving some of the  
intractable problems of tornadoes,'' Smith said. ``This research 
potentially could lead to improved warning times to give people 
even more time to take shelter.''

<HEADLINE> Bogart, Hepburn Top Stars List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- He didn't have the stunning good looks of  
Clark Gable. He didn't always perform better than his 
contemporaries, or die an icon-making death like James Dean. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Humphrey Bogart had a beautiful relationship with  
America. 
</P>
<P>
	More than four decades after his death, Bogie's fans put him  
atop the American Film Institute's list of the greatest American 
male screen legends of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a guy who didn't think of acting as a competitive sport,  
he would have been honored and awestruck by this,'' said Stephen 
Bogart, the actor's son. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Bogart had much to be proud of Tuesday. His mother,  
Lauren Bacall, was No. 20 on the greatest actress list, behind top 
vote getters Katharine Hepburn and Bette Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm shocked and I'm flattered beyond words,'' Miss Bacall said  
by telephone from Italy. ``My God! I would never have expected it. 
But I'm not surprised that Bogie's No. 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics complained that the list overlooks many stars of  
the seminal silent era as well as musicals, but most agree that 
those who made the cut deserved the honor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd find it hard to argue against anyone who's on the list,''  
film critic and historian Leonard Maltin said. ``But lists are 
fundamentally silly. It's never going to be to everybody's 
satisfaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bogie, most agreed, had to be on it -- somewhere, at least.  
</P>
<P>
	``You look at the 75 films he's done, from `The African Queen'  
to `Casablanca,' `Treasure of the Sierra Madre' and `The Maltese 
Falcon.' These were all such disparate roles, yet he carried them 
all off,'' Stephen Bogart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Grant was No. 2 on the lists, followed by James Stewart,  
Marlon Brando, Fred Astaire, Henry Fonda, Clark Gable, James 
Cagney, Spencer Tracy and Charlie Chaplin. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Miss Davis among female legends were Audrey Hepburn,  
Ingrid Bergman, Greta Garbo, Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Judy 
Garland, Marlene Dietrich and Joan Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballots were sent to about 1,800 voters, including critics,  
historians, directors, producers and screenwriters. To be eligible, 
actors had to have made their debut in or before 1951; also 
eligible were those who made their debuts after 1950 but have since 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, current box office stars like Tom Hanks, Meryl Streep,  
John Travolta, Harrison Ford and Paul Newman weren't included on 
the list of 500 nominees announced in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors were asked to consider five criteria: star quality  
(charisma and presence), craft (ability to embody different 
characters), legacy (body of work), popularity and historical 
context. The roster was revealed Tuesday night during a three-hour 
CBS-TV special. 
</P>
<P>
	Those eligible who didn't make the top 50 lineup included  
Douglas Fairbanks, Rudolph Valentino, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, 
Harold Lloyd, Alec Guinness, Mickey Rooney, Doris Day, Bob Hope, 
Will Rogers, Lon Chaney, Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi, Clara Bow and 
Gloria Swanson. 
</P>
<P>
	``The silent film people always get the shaft. This is more a  
comment on a lack of cinema literacy,'' Maltin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Entertainment writers and editors of The Associated Press, in a  
recently compiled list of the 25 most significant stars of the 
century, also selected Bogart, Miss Bacall and Miss Hepburn, but 
included Fairbanks, Valentino and Laurel and Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFI compilation also paid little regard for musicals.  
Astaire, Miss Rogers and Miss Garland appeared from that film 
genre, but where was Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra? 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the film institute celebrated the centennial of  
movies by announcing the 100 greatest American motion pictures of 
all time, with ``Citizen Kane'' topping the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics and movie buffs quickly jumped on the AFI for  
overlooking so many silent movies. Only four were chosen, and way 
down in 44th place was D.W. Griffith's ``The Birth of a Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect that sort of thing again. Someone will find fault,''  
AFI Chairman Tom Pollock said. ``Lists by their nature create 
controversy because of who is on them and who is left off them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Bacall, however, was tickled pink to make the recent list.  
</P>
<P>
	``Gee, this makes me feel a helluva lot more important than I  
am,'' said the star of ``To Have and Have Not'' and ``The Big 
Sleep,'' both with Bogart. ``I'm going to call my agent right 
now.''

<HEADLINE> Drug Chief Discourages Legalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legalizing drugs would only lead to more  
abuse, crime and social disruption, White House drug policy chief 
Barry McCaffrey said Wednesday during a House hearing about the 
drug legalization movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Youth access to and use of alcohol and cigarettes is bad  
enough,'' McCaffrey told the House Government Reform criminal 
justice panel. ``American parents clearly don't want children able 
to use a fake ID at the corner store to buy heroin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey was backed up by the Drug Enforcement Administration's  
deputy administrator, Donnie Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that ``once America gives in to a drug culture, and all  
the social decay that comes with such a culture, it would be very 
hard to restore a decent civic culture without a cost to America's 
civil liberties that would be prohibitively high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But others questioned the emphasis on criminalizing drug use.  
</P>
<P>
	``Dysfunctional laws,'' said Ira Glasser of the American Civil  
Liberties Union, have resulted in ``massive incarceration -- much of 
it racially disparate -- and the violation of a wide range of 
constitutional rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The number of drug offenders in state and federal prisons has  
gone from 12,000 in 1980 to 281,000 in 1997, said Scott Ehlers of 
the Drug Policy Foundation, which advocates drug law reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Drug use and addiction should be treated as public health  
issues, not criminal justice problems,'' Ehlers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Opinions differed among the panel members.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., chairman of the subcommittee, said there  
can be no retreat in the war on drugs because ``the simple truth is 
that drugs destroy lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., who said he lives in a  
drug-infested neighborhood in Baltimore, said he opposed the 
criminalization of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am for making sure that people are treated. We must have a  
more humane society,'' Cummings said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey agreed that treatment is crucial, explaining that the  
administration had requested $3.5 billion for treatment and 
research programs for next year, up 5.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said any trend toward legalizing drugs would be  
disastrous, leading to increased addiction, more crime, more 
traffic and workplace accidents, as well as more child abuse and 
neglect. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Leshner, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse  
at the National Institutes of Health, warned that even short-term 
use of marijuana can affect the brain, a person's memory and their 
learning skills. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even occasional drug use can be dangerous, and there is no way  
to predict who may suffer drastic consequences as a result of 
experimenting with drugs,'' Leshner said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey said that message has gotten through to people who  
experimented with drugs in the 1960s and 1970s. He cited a survey 
showing that among Americans who have tried drugs in the past, 73 
percent believe that parents should forbid children from using 
drugs at any time.

<HEADLINE> High Humidity Slow Alaska Wildfires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Cool, moist weather has slowed a pair  
of fires that have burned nearly 16,000 acres in rural Alaska over 
the past five days, including one that forced the evacuation of an 
Army post. 
</P>
<P>
	That fire has charred nearly 14,000 acres of black spruce forest  
about 250 miles northeast of Anchorage. By Tuesday, firefighters 
had built containment lines around about 30 percent of the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire started Friday and destroyed a guard shack and  
recreation building at Fort Greely, an Army post near Delta 
Junction. The Army evacuated the base Sunday, but hundreds of 
soldiers and their families were allowed to return Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fire's still going on,'' said Maj. Robert Marcinkowski,  
the Army post's deputy commander. ``There's a lot of hot spots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A dry spring both north and south of the Alaska Range has state  
forestry officials worried that the next few weeks will be among 
the busiest in recent memory. Forty-eight other fires were burning 
in Alaska on Tuesday, but only four were being fought. 
</P>
<P>
	Burn permits have been suspended across the state indefinitely.  
</P>
<P>
	In the village of Minto, about 50 miles northwest of Fairbanks,  
150 firefighters worked to keep a 2,100-acre fire from reaching 
homes. Heavy smoke forced about 20 residents to flee the blaze, but 
officials said the fire slowed significantly Tuesday and no longer 
posed much of a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	That blaze began Sunday at the village dump.  
</P>
<P>
	In Arizona, crews continued to douse hot spots from a wildfire  
on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation and worked to keep a fire in 
Grand Canyon National Park from spreading. Some 4,500 acres were 
burned on the reservation and the blaze destroyed 17 homes. 
</P>
<P>
	A slow-moving fire on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon had  
spread to about 1,100 acres Tuesday, according to the National Park 
Service.

<HEADLINE> Groups Offer Diet Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The advice is nothing new: Cut fat and  
cholesterol, eat plenty of grains, fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of the nation's top health organizations have jointly  
endorsed a healthy eating plan meant to help stave off the diseases 
that kill most people -- heart disease, stroke, cancer and diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Unified Dietary Guidelines were being released today by the  
American Cancer Society, the American Dietetic Association, the 
American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Institutes of Health 
and the Dallas-based American Heart Association. 
</P>
<P>
	They recommend that a healthy daily diet include no more than 10  
percent of calories from saturated fat and no more than 30 percent 
of total calories from all types of fat. 
</P>
<P>
	The diet also suggests that 55 percent or more of daily calories  
come from complex carbohydrates such as grains, fruits and 
vegetables. Dietary cholesterol should be limited to 300 milligrams 
or less each day (less than the amount in two eggs), and salt to 
six grams (one teaspoon) per day. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendations closely follow the Department of  
Agriculture's Food Guide Pyramid, intended to ensure that diets 
contain enough vitamins, minerals, fiber and other essential 
nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is to be published in the July 27 issue of Circulation,  
a journal of the American Heart Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news is that we don't need one diet to prevent heart  
disease, another to decrease cancer risk and yet another to prevent 
obesity and diabetes,'' said Richard J. Deckelbaum, M.D., co-author 
of the article and professor of nutrition at Columbia University. 
``A single healthy diet cuts across disease categories to lower the 
risk of many chronic conditions.''

<HEADLINE> Cable &AMP; Wireless To Take Over IDC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Britain's Cable &AMP; Wireless PLC said Wednesday it  
will take a 97.69 percent stake in Japanese phone carrier 
International Digital Communications Inc., a key part of a strategy 
to expand its global reach. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement in Tokyo came one week after Cable &AMP; Wireless  
won a bidding war for the Tokyo-based company against Japanese 
giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The takeover -- the first to give a foreign firm a controlling  
stake in a Japanese phone company -- will cost Cable &AMP; Wireless 55.2 
billion yen ($459.1 million) in cash to buy the 82 percent of IDC 
that it does not already own. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 134 of IDC's 141 shareholders accepted the British  
company's bid of 110,577 yen ($920) per share. IDC's main 
shareholders include Toyota Motor Corp. and trading house Itochu 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal makes the company worth around 69 billion yen ($574  
million). 
</P>
<P>
	In order to provide full service to the corporate clients it  
prizes, Cable &AMP; Wireless will still need to link up with a local 
partner -- such as NTT -- to access the domestic phone network in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japanese partners are critical,'' said Stephen Pettit, a  
senior director at Cable &AMP; Wireless. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettit said international cable capacity at IDC, which is to be  
renamed Cable &AMP; Wireless IDC, will be increased by 400 percent over 
the next two years and then doubled every year thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, the president of NTT, Junichiro Miyazu, said his  
company had withdrawn from the bidding for IDC because the price 
had gone too high. 
</P>
<P>
	Miyazu said that while taking over IDC would have been the  
fastest way for NTT to enter the international market, it will 
build its own international unit from scratch.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola, Hellenic Discuss Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Coca-Cola Beverages PLC is talking with Hellenic  
Bottling Company SA about a possible merger worth $6.8 billion that 
would create the dominant drinks bottler for the Coca-Cola Co. in 
eastern and central Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Greece's Hellenic Bottling would hold a majority stake of around  
56 percent in the enlarged group, but Coca-Cola Beverage chief 
executive Neville Isdell would become chief executive of the merged 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Beverages PLC acknowledged Wednesday that the merger  
was being discussed, but neither company would comment further. It 
also cautioned that an agreement may not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the proposed merger makes strategic sense, would  
fill a management vacuum at the Hellenic operation and is likely to 
please the world's top soft-drink retailer, Coca-Cola Co., which 
holds a majority stake in Coca-Cola Beverages. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged group would be the second-largest bottler for the  
Coca-Cola system in the world with operations spanning 22 
countries, primarily in central and eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	While there is little geographical overlap between the two  
bottlers, analysts say considerable synergy benefits could likely 
be gained from combining bottling plants and distribution networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Beverages has operations in 13 European countries,  
including Ukraine, Belarus and Hungary, while Hellenic operates in 
nine countries, including Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The only countries in which both companies operate is Romania.  
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the move would also fill a management vacuum at  
Hellenic Bottling, which hasn't had a chief executive for about 18 
months.

<HEADLINE> Effort To Improve End-of-Life Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- People who are dying know what they  
want. 
</P>
<P>
	In surveys for West Virginia University's Center for Health  
Ethics and Law, social workers, nurses, clergy and pharmacists 
reaffirm what the terminally ill say: Death should come pain-free 
in a comfortable setting, and without bankrupting a family. 
</P>
<P>
	But programs that focus on more than medicine -- spiritual and  
mental well-being, for example -- can be hard to come by. That's 
about to change, said James Keresztury, associate director of the 
Initiative to Improve End-of-Life Care. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to improve care to the dying and do it efficiently,''  
he said. ``We have the highest proportion of elderly in the country 
and because of that, it's a natural fact: As the years go by in the 
next decade, how we take care of these people is going to be 
critical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next month, six community-based teams of doctors, nurses, social  
workers, clergy and attorneys will be trained in West Virginia to 
help people die comfortably. Similar efforts are under way in other 
states, including Hawaii and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	Care for the dying has shot to the forefront of public  
consciousness, in part because of Dr. Jack Kevorkian. The retired 
Michigan physician is serving a 10- to 25-year sentence for 
second-degree murder in the nationally televised injection death 
last fall of Thomas Youk, who suffered from Lou Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, who says he has helped 130 people kill themselves  
since 1990, sent a videotape of Youk's death to ``60 Minutes,'' 
hoping to force the issue of assisted suicide in court. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see this as a wake-up call to the health-care system,''  
Keresztury said. ``It tells us we need to be more proactive. We 
don't want euthanasia to need to be an option for people. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you had 10 people from the medical community around a  
table, maybe two of the 10 would agree with Kevorkian,'' he said. 
``He's doing all of us a favor in that he's forcing us to look and 
evaluate what we're doing for dying patients. From my viewpoint, 
it's a positive outcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The medical community has focused so heavily on technology and  
finding cures for diseases that it has lost sight of other aspects 
of patient care, said Connie Duke, director of St. Mary's Regional 
Cancer Center in Huntington. 
</P>
<P>
	About 540,000 people in the United States were admitted to  
hospice programs in 1998, said Stephen Connor, vice president for 
research and professional development at the National Hospice 
Organization in Arlington, Va. That's about 23 percent of all 2.3 
billion of the nation's deaths, not just those who were terminally 
ill. 
</P>
<P>
	About 33 percent of Americans will die without any need for  
end-of-life care in a given year, either succumbing quickly to an 
acute illness or dying traumatically, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 years ago, the number of people who got hospice care  
was virtually zero, Connor said, but the approach remains 
underused. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies have shown that only about 11 percent of West Virginia's  
terminally ill receive hospice care. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an art to medicine,'' Duke said Tuesday. ``You have  
to combine both, technology and the realization of when people are 
at the end of their lives. We are not always as helpful to patients 
and their families as we could have been. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trained that way, to provide as much health care as we  
can, but the benefit must be better than the burden,'' Duke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terminally ill patients eventually reach a stage where they no  
longer need aggressive treatment, Duke said. Instead, they want 
pain management, psychological and familial support, spiritual 
advice and counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Medical schools need to focus more on supportive care and  
symptom management,'' Duke said. ``We need to make medicine more 
psychosocial and spiritual. ... Symptom management truly needs to 
be learned and taught. There is not much focus on that yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Center for Health Ethics and Law has formed a coalition of  
15 West Virginia organizations to run the training programs that 
begin July 1 for teams from Charleston, Huntington, Martinsburg and 
Morgantown. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheeling and Parkersburg teams should begin training by 2000, as  
will the staff of a nursing home that Keresztury hopes will become 
a model. 
</P>
<P>
	The Claude Worthington Benedum Foundation of Pittsburgh has  
given the center $375,000, and Keresztury has applied for an equal 
amount from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The program has seven task forces that will focus on training  
health-care professionals while also tackling such issues as 
funding and possible legislation incorporating all end-of-life laws 
into a single comprehensible bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Each team will receive $25,000 in seed money to develop  
community-based programs. As the programs develop, they will be 
expanded to rural areas, Keresztury said. 
</P>
<P>
	The task forces also will launch a media campaign to address  
``society's general refusal to talk about death,'' Keresztury said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to use a multitude of strategies to work on that  
issue, starting with making children feel comfortable to ask 
questions. We want to get them thinking before they're in crisis,'' 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Panthers Sign Guard Nate Newton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Nate Newton, cast aside by the Dallas  
Cowboys after 13 years, became the oldest member of the Carolina 
Panthers when he signed a one-year deal with the team Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Newton, 37, appeared in six of the last seven Pro Bowls but was  
deemed expandable by Dallas, which is expected to move Larry Allen, 
its top offensive lineman, from left tackle to left guard. The 
Cowboys also cited the potential shown by rookie linemen Solomon 
Page and Kelvin Garmon for the team's decision against trying to 
re-sign Newton. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the Panthers nor Newton's agent, Jim Neader, would  
release financial terms of his contract with Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's heavily incentive-based,'' Neader said. ``It's a show  
what you can do-type of contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newton began his pro career with the Washington Redskins in  
1983, but was cut before playing the next two seasons with the 
USFL's Tampa Bay Bandits. He signed with Dallas in 1986 and helped 
the Cowboys to three Super Bowl titles. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-3, 320-pound Newton started 180 of a possible 191  
games with the Cowboys, including all 16 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Newton, the Panthers released guard Corbin  
Lacina, who was signed last year as an unrestricted free agent but 
was largely ineffective during a season in which he battled injury 
problems.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ammunition Sold to Civilians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some 100,000 rounds of armor-piercing  
ammunition were transferred from the military to the civilian 
market over the past year, a congressional study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The transfer was done under a government program set up to help  
the military dispose of surplus and obsolete ammunition, said the 
study released Wednesday by the Democratic minority of the House 
Government Reform Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the Pentagon sells surplus .50-caliber shells  
designed for long-range military sniper weapons for $1 a ton to a 
West Virginia manufacturing company. 
</P>
<P>
	Talon Manufacturing dismantled 98 percent of the rounds for  
scrap, but it refurbished the remaining 2 percent and offered them 
for sale, including to foreign military and civilian buyers, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sale of armor piercing ammunition in the civilian market  
poses a threat to public safety,'' said the report, while 
acknowledging that no laws are being violated. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colombian and Brazilian military were listed by the report  
as Talon's foreign military customers, purchasing a total of 
203,000 rounds over the past year. The company also refurbished and 
sold back to the U.S. military 35,000 rounds, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing nothing wrong. I'm not sure what the issue is,''  
said John Connor, a Talon executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also issued a written statement saying its  
operations ``are conducted according to contract and or appropriate 
statutory or regulatory requirements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Talon does not buy ammunition from the government but is paid  
by the government to demilitarize ammunition as established by 
contract,'' the statement said, disputing the report's claim that 
the government sells the surplus ammunition for $1 a ton. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Rod Blagojevich, D-Ill., who with Rep. Henry Waxman,  
D-Calif., commissioned the study, said the program allowing 
high-powered ammunition to pass from the military into civilian 
hands may not be illegal -- but should be. 
</P>
<P>
	``This shows an unhealthy relationship between the Pentagon and  
gun dealers,'' Blagojevich said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was based partly on an undercover investigation by  
the General Accounting Office, the investigative branch of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	It said one unidentified dealer boasted in a tape-recorded  
conversation that the ammunition would ``go through six inches of 
steel up to a 45-degree angle at 1,000 yards'' and could easily go 
through bulletproof glass or an armored limousine. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its firepower, .50-caliber ammunition is virtually  
unregulated, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The investigation showed that the U.S. military is indirectly  
arming civilians with some of the most powerful and destructive 
ammunition currently available,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Talon is permitted to refurbish the ammunition and sell it in  
the civilian market under the Department of Defense's Conventional 
Demilitarization Program. 
</P>
<P>
	Talon has an exclusive agreement with the Pentagon. From the 98  
percent of .50-calibre ammunition that it dismantles for scrap the 
company manufactures an explosive used in road construction, the 
report said.

<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A drunken bicyclist who was seriously injured  
when he ran a stop sign and pedaled into the path of a police 
cruiser speeding to a call was awarded $95,485. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Bob Evans ruled last week that the officer in Kenner was  
partially to blame for the 1996 collision with Jerry Lawrence, then 
58. His legs were broken and his skull was fractured. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence's lawyer, Rusty Knight, said the ruling proves that  
``drunks have some rights, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence had a blood-alcohol level of 0.13, which exceeds the  
legal limit of 0.10. Knight argued that Officer Chad Jacquet was 
driving too fast and could have avoided the wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacquet said his siren was blaring and his lights were flashing  
as he sped to a domestic disturbance. Police plan to appeal, saying 
there was nothing Jacquet could do to avoid the wreck. 
</P>

	State law allows emergency vehicles to exceed the speed limit as  
long as they do not endanger life or property.

<HEADLINE> Study Tracks NIH Funding by Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Diseases like AIDS and breast cancer get a disproportionately  
large share of federal research dollars in relation to the toll 
they take on public health, experts suggested today in the New 
England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, conducted by researchers at Johns Hopkins University,  
is the first systematic comparison of National Institutes of Health 
funding for specific diseases and the burden imposed by the 
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	It found a strong correlation between NIH funding in fiscal 1996  
and the years of life lost to disability and death from 29 diseases 
in the world's industrialized nations -- a measure called 
disability-adjusted life-years, or DALYs. 
</P>
<P>
	That's good news for NIH, said Dr. Cary Gross, who led the  
study. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people have been critical of the NIH for quite a  
while in saying their funding allocation was arbitrary,'' Gross 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the study found that diseases with strong political  
lobbies -- especially AIDS -- got more money according to the DALY 
measure than diseases with less-vocal advocates, such as emphysema 
and depression. 
</P>
<P>
	AIDS got $1.4 billion in grant money in fiscal 1996 and was  
estimated to lead to the loss of 1.27 million DALYs -- about $1,114 
per DALY. Breast cancer received $381.9 million for 1.42 million 
DALYs, or $269 per DALY. Depression got $148.8 million for 8.4 
million DALYs, or $17 per DALY. Emphysema got $62.4 million for 
2.28 million DALYs, or $27 per DALY. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found a correlation between NIH funding and two  
other, commonly used measures of the burden of disease: deaths 
caused and years of life lost to premature death. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gross said the DALY measure is superior because it better  
captures the effect of chronic, debilitating diseases like mental 
illness and diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauri Flynn, executive director of the National Alliance for the  
Mentally Ill, said the study suggests that research into mental 
illness is not as high a priority as it should be. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see ourselves as historically underfunded,'' she said. ``It  
would certainly gladden my heart if they took some of this 
information into the equation more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, scientists and advocates warned that using the study to  
conclude that NIH is pouring too much money into AIDS research 
would be a huge mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	AIDS is not the most burdensome disease in the industrialized  
world, but it is deadly, infectious and rampant in Africa and parts 
of Asia, said Daniel Zingale, head of AIDS Action. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a global pandemic that threatens to bring down entire  
nations, and America is the leader in medical research in the 
world,'' Zingale said. ``If you make the error of simply looking at 
it as dollars for deaths, you could come to some rash 
conclusions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jeffrey Laurence, a Cornell University researcher and  
adviser to the American Foundation for AIDS Research, also noted 
that AIDS research has led to breakthroughs in other diseases, such 
as new drugs for hepatitis B and C -- two other disabling, worldwide 
viral epidemics. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the money that's being spent on AIDS research has broad  
benefits for other diseases,'' Laurence said. 
</P>
<P>
	A government advisory group, the Institute of Medicine,  
recommended such a cost comparison be done. About one-third of 
NIH's $15.6 billion budget is spent on disease-specific research; 
the rest supports basic science. 
</P>
<P>
	Leon Rosenberg, chairman of the committee that recommended the  
comparison, said the study provided important information but it 
would be foolish to use the burden of disease as the sole criterion 
for funding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm concerned about the use of these data'' by advocacy  
groups, he said. ``But the alternative is worse -- namely, to wall 
scientific decision-making off from any public scrutiny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Harold Varmus, the head of  
NIH, also cautioned that NIH considers many factors when awarding 
grants, including whether a big push in a particular area is likely 
to yield major scientific gains or public health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Advocacy groups have tended, understandably, to focus their  
attention on alleged inequities between the toll of a specific 
disease and spending for research on that disease,'' Varmus wrote. 
``These claims are of great concern to the NIH, because they 
threaten to undermine the agency's credibility, and to Congress, 
because they challenge its oversight in a politically sensitive 
area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Donald Mattison, medical director of the March of Dimes,  
which gives out about $25 million a year to study birth defects, 
disputed the study's suggestion that prenatal and newborn research 
is underfunded. He noted, for example, that alcoholism and diabetes 
grants have been used to look at the effects of those diseases on 
fetal development and pregnancy.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Holds First Major Fundraiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Multimillionaire businessman Steve Forbes, who  
spent an estimated $30 million on his failed 1996 presidential 
campaign, held the first big fund-raiser of his 2000 bid for the 
White House on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes expects to raise about $1 million from 1,200 supporters  
at the event at Manhattan's posh Waldorf-Astoria hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	An aide said that so far Forbes has been raising money for his  
campaign for the Republican presidential nomination largely through 
direct mail and over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	But his campaign costs have escalated because of national ads he  
began airing in May. Forbes was the first candidate to buy national 
air time. 
</P>
<P>
	The aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Forbes may  
spend upwards of $10 million this summer and that he plans hundreds 
of more fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the millions he's spent so far, Forbes still trails far  
behind former Red Cross president Elizabeth Dole and Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush in the preference polls. 
</P>
<P>
	In prepared remarks to supporters here, Forbes said he is  
optimistic about America's future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have before us an opportunity unlike any other in  
history,'' Forbes said. ``... Our future is not a matter of chance, 
but a matter of choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said a president ``owes the American people a respect for  
reality, a respect for truth and a respect for the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The past 6 1/2 years have also taught us another important  
lesson, which is that character does count,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Phil Jackson Heard News From Eskimo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Phil Jackson stepped off a fishing  
boat in an Alaskan village and got the news from an Eskimo boy: ``I 
hear you're coach of the Lakers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And with that, Jackson returned to the NBA following a year of  
meditation and reflection -- a year when, at times, he was 
blissfully out of touch with civilization. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went to Alaska not knowing if this was going to happen or  
not, and I came back and it was a fait accompli,'' Jackson said 
Wednesday, announcing what had been an open secret for days. ``I 
think it was a marriage that was in the making. Of all the jobs out 
there, this was the one that piqued my interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Lakers lured the former Chicago Bulls coach back  
to the real world with a five-year, $30 million contract that makes 
him one of the NBA's highest-paid coaches. Boston's Rick Pitino 
reportedly makes $7 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The 53-year-old Jackson takes over a team that hasn't been in  
the NBA Finals since 1991 and was swept out of the playoffs the 
past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his first order of business will be to get the team  
accustomed to his distinct style, which features more spacing 
between players, more passing and spreading the shots around. 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers vice president Magic Johnson, who led the team to its  
last NBA title, in 1988, was delighted to hear Jackson's plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired of `Go in to Shaq, Go in to Shaq, Go in to Shaq.'  
Everybody in America knows what the Lakers are going to do,'' 
Johnson said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	``There can't be any more excuses about the coach. We just got  
the best coach in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's news conference covered a range of subjects, including  
questions about whether he could do for the Lakers what he did for 
Michael Jordan and the Bulls -- that is, guide them to six titles in 
nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said he believes leadership is ``one of the vacuums this  
team has shown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They're very, very young; Kobe Bryant, a player like  
Shaquille, who's a tremendous athlete and a tremendous force in 
this game, yet has not really developed into a leader at this 
point. I think there are some things a coach can do to bring that 
leadership out, and that's part of my job,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the O'Neal will be the focal point of the offense,  
mentioning the success Wilt Chamberlain had scoring and setting up 
teammates for shots when he was with the 76ers and the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson also said he didn't expect the Lakers to acquire former  
Bulls star Scottie Pippen or reacquire Dennis Rodman, or lure 
Jordan out of retirement. But he didn't completely rule anything 
out, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking about Jordan, he said: ``I'm sure everyone would love  
to see him come back, but I'm pretty sure that's not going to be 
accomplished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he chuckled and added, ``But Jerry West may talk to him.''  
</P>
<P>
	The coach indicated he would bring in some of his former  
colleagues as assistants, possibly including triangle offense guru 
Tex Winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's .738 winning percentage in the regular season and .730  
in the playoffs are the highest of any coach in NBA history. His 
record with the Bulls was 545-193 in the regular season and 111-41 
in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Phil talked about is how to get players to really trust  
themselves, how to get everyone to share with the ball. In the 
offense he plans to run, everyone has to do that or no one is ever 
going to score,'' Lakers vice president Jerry West said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That to me is the most important aspect of having him here.  
Phil seems to have a way of creating a really positive environment. 
More importantly, a confidence in players that some coaches just 
seem like they can't do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he liked being tagged a Zen master, Jackson replied:  
``I don't like it, but I'll accept it because it has that ring 
about it that means things are going to be done a little 
differently than square. I want to keep it fresh, lively and 
hopefully fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of the Lakers players was at the news conference, although  
Jackson said he had talked with Bryant earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Team owner Jerry Buss, who hired Jackson rather than retain  
interim coach Kurt Rambis, was not present because he was at the 
hospital while one of his sons was having surgery for a broken 
ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson already was scheduled to be in Los Angeles on Wednesday  
to campaign for presidential candidate Bill Bradley, his former New 
York Knicks teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to thank Bill and his people for flying me here  
and saving the Lakers the price of the ticket,'' Jackson quipped.

<HEADLINE> Woman Guilty of Vehicular Homicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARLBORO, Mass. (AP) -- A 78-year-old woman who smashed her car  
into a house while delivering a meal to a friend -- killing an 
elderly woman inside -- was convicted today of vehicular homicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish it had been me that was dead,'' Margaret Davis told a  
jury during her trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was placed on two years' probation and lost her license  
for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1998, Davis crashed through the front of a home while  
on her way to visit a friend, killing Antonette Leone, 84. Davis 
said her car slipped on a patch of ice. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of the victim said Davis offered only a slight  
apology, then left. Police said Davis asked if she could finish her 
errand. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was determined to complete her mission -- to leave and  
deliver those meals,'' Natick police Sgt. Paul Thompson said. ``I 
thought she might drive away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police ruled out mechanical defects or icy weather conditions as  
a cause. Investigators said Davis was driving too fast, and a 
witness testified she had run him off the road moments before the 
crash.

<HEADLINE> Senate Approves Steel Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation designed to address the U.S. steel  
industry's long-term ability to compete won approval today from a 
Senate committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Finance Committee took up the bill as an alternative  
to global quotas, which many committee members opposed and 
considered a violation of international trade laws. The committee 
approved the bill, 16-3. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would initiate an investigation into foreign market  
practices that could insulate foreign producers from fair 
competition with the U.S. industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Those practices include governments giving their producers  
subsidies and foreign companies flooding the U.S. market with 
products at prices below production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would also require the development of a  
comprehensive government strategy to eliminate those practices and 
would modify U.S. trade laws to ease U.S. companies' ability to 
prove injury in certain trade complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. William Roth, R-Del., the committee's chairman, said the  
bill was designed to ``address the real problem facing the steel 
industry, the worldwide overcapacity of steel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steel-state lawmakers denounced the bill as too weak and said it  
offered little short-term relief to an industry that has suffered 
thousands of layoffs and three company bankruptcies. 
</P>
<P>
	``These limited proposals would only put us in a better position  
to deal with the next steel import crisis,'' said Sen. Jay 
Rockefeller, D-W.Va., vice chairman of the Senate Steel Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockefeller said the measure appeared to be an effort to take  
votes away from the quota bill, which the House passed 
overwhelmingly in March, despite the threat of a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry has sought quotas and other sanctions to block  
low-priced steel imports, which reached record levels last year in 
the aftermath of the Asian economic crisis.

<HEADLINE>  Jackson, Lakers `Wed' in Hollywood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- The hippie is going Hollywood.  
</P>
<P>
	It's the ``Shaq, Kobe &AMP; Glen Show,'' directed by Phil Jackson  
and featuring Jack Nicholson and Dyan Cannon in supporting roles. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, the motorcyle-riding Zen master with a knack for  
conjuring up championships, is bringing his unique coaching style 
to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	He agreed Tuesday to become the Lakers' coach for a reported $30  
million, five-year contract. He said the negotiations went 
smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like a very lucky man today to be in a position where I  
can accept this job,'' Jackson told a news conference. ``I think 
this was a marriage that was in the making.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who replaces interim coach Kurt Rambis, called the  
Lakers as ``a team on the verge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We think he's a pre-eminent coach in America,'' said Jerry  
West, the Lakers' executive vice president. ``We think this is 
going to be the start of another fantastic time for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson enters the next stage of his basketball life without  
Michael Jordan, whom he hasn't spoke with since May. And, in what 
might be the ultimate compliment for any player, he said Kobe 
Bryant reminds him of Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was coveted by the New Jersey Nets and, to a lesser  
degree, the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of all the jobs out there, this was the one that piqued my  
interest,'' he said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA's coach of the '90s with the marquee cast of Jordan,  
Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman, Jackson will try to match his 
success with Shaquille O'Neal, Bryant and Glen Rice. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson didn't rule out having Pippen and Rodman rejoin him in  
Los Angeles. But he said he had not conferred with West about that. 
</P>
<P>
	He takes over a team that hasn't won a title in 11 years after  
being the league's dominant force in the 1980s with Magic Johnson, 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Showtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers won five championships in the '80s, but haven't  
reached the NBA Finals since 1991, when they were beaten by Jackson 
and the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	During his nine years in Chicago, Jackson orchestrated the  
diverse talents and egos of his stars into an NBA powerhouse that 
won six titles this decade and became one of the league's best 
teams ever. 
</P>
<P>
	He will face a similar challenge with the Lakers, widely  
regarded as a splintered group of talented underachievers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson seems equipped for the job.  
</P>
<P>
	A coach who has gone to bookstores to pick out books for each of  
his players, he was motivator, mediator and basketball maestro all 
in one for the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	He related to the players with, as Jordan refers to it, ``that  
Zen Buddhism stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the bizarre Rodman, who spent a mostly disastrous month and  
half with the Lakers this season, thrived under Jackson in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	When Rodman heard Jackson was taking the Lakers' job, he told  
Fox Sports News, ``I would like to play for Phil Jackson and the 
Lakers. I think he's the only coach in the league that really 
understands me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 53-year-old Jackson, who took this season off, had a 545-193  
record at Chicago and was 111-41 in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	He has the highest winning percentage of any coach in NBA  
regular-season (.738) and playoff (.730) history, and was coach of 
the year in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson averaged 6.7 points in his 13-year NBA playing career,  
11 of them with the New York Knicks. He missed their 1970 title 
season because of a back injury, but played on their 1973 
championship team. 
</P>
<P>
	He is one of only nine men who have won NBA titles both as a  
player and as a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson worked his way up the coaching ranks, leading the Albany  
Patroons of the CBA for five years. He served as an assistant under 
Doug Collins with the Bulls for two years before Collins was fired 
and he became the head coach on July 10, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers fired Del Harris 12 games into last season and  
promoted Rambis from his job as an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	They were swept in the playoffs for the second year in a row,  
losing in the second round to San Antonio after being beaten by 
Utah in the Western Conference finals last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers' courtship of Jackson was a whirlwind affair. The  
Lakers recently indicated that Rambis would be retained, but team 
owner Jerry Buss instead decided to spend more millions to go after

<HEADLINE> Fruit of the Loom Shares Tumble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Shares of apparel maker Fruit of the Loom tumbled  
nearly 13 percent Wednesday after the company warned second-quarter 
profits will fall well below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock fell $1.37 1/2 to $9.31 1/4 a share on the New  
York Stock Exchange after the manufacturer said a production 
shortfall particularly in its activewear business would slash 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in the sports licensing division also were expected to  
fall because of weak industry demand and a decline in the European 
market, the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Fruit of the Loom said it expects revenues for the quarter  
ending July 3 to fall to between $570 million and $590 million, 
from $628 million in the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The company did not provide a specific projection of its  
earnings, but Wall Street had been expecting it to earn 49 cents a 
share, according to a survey of analysts by First Call Corp.

<HEADLINE>  Jackson, Lakers `Wed' in Hollywood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- The hippie is going Hollywood.  
</P>
<P>
	It's the ``Shaq, Kobe &AMP; Glen Show,'' directed by Phil Jackson  
and featuring Jack Nicholson and Dyan Cannon in supporting roles. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, the motorcyle-riding Zen master with a knack for  
conjuring up championships, is bringing his unique coaching style 
to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	He agreed Tuesday to become the Lakers' coach for a reported $30  
million, five-year contract. He said the negotiations went 
smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like a very lucky man today to be in a position where I  
can accept this job,'' Jackson told a news conference. ``I think 
this was a marriage that was in the making.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who replaces interim coach Kurt Rambis, called the  
Lakers as ``a team on the verge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We think he's a pre-eminent coach in America,'' said Jerry  
West, the Lakers' executive vice president. ``We think this is 
going to be the start of another fantastic time for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson enters the next stage of his basketball life without  
Michael Jordan, whom he hasn't spoke with since May. And, in what 
might be the ultimate compliment for any player, he said Kobe 
Bryant reminds him of Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was coveted by the New Jersey Nets and, to a lesser  
degree, the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of all the jobs out there, this was the one that piqued my  
interest,'' he said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA's coach of the '90s with the marquee cast of Jordan,  
Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman, Jackson will try to match his 
success with Shaquille O'Neal, Bryant and Glen Rice. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson didn't rule out having Pippen and Rodman rejoin him in  
Los Angeles. But he said he had not conferred with West about that. 
</P>
<P>
	He takes over a team that hasn't won a title in 11 years after  
being the league's dominant force in the 1980s with Magic Johnson, 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Showtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers won five championships in the '80s, but haven't  
reached the NBA Finals since 1991, when they were beaten by Jackson 
and the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	During his nine years in Chicago, Jackson orchestrated the  
diverse talents and egos of his stars into an NBA powerhouse that 
won six titles this decade and became one of the league's best 
teams ever. 
</P>
<P>
	He will face a similar challenge with the Lakers, widely  
regarded as a splintered group of talented underachievers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson seems equipped for the job.  
</P>
<P>
	A coach who has gone to bookstores to pick out books for each of  
his players, he was motivator, mediator and basketball maestro all 
in one for the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	He related to the players with, as Jordan refers to it, ``that  
Zen Buddhism stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the bizarre Rodman, who spent a mostly disastrous month and  
half with the Lakers this season, thrived under Jackson in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	When Rodman heard Jackson was taking the Lakers' job, he told  
Fox Sports News, ``I would like to play for Phil Jackson and the 
Lakers. I think he's the only coach in the league that really 
understands me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 53-year-old Jackson, who took this season off, had a 545-193  
record at Chicago and was 111-41 in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	He has the highest winning percentage of any coach in NBA  
regular-season (.738) and playoff (.730) history, and was coach of 
the year in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson averaged 6.7 points in his 13-year NBA playing career,  
11 of them with the New York Knicks. He missed their 1970 title 
season because of a back injury, but played on their 1973 
championship team. 
</P>
<P>
	He is one of only nine men who have won NBA titles both as a  
player and as a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson worked his way up the coaching ranks, leading the Albany  
Patroons of the CBA for five years. He served as an assistant under 
Doug Collins with the Bulls for two years before Collins was fired 
and he became the head coach on July 10, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers fired Del Harris 12 games into last season and  
promoted Rambis from his job as an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	They were swept in the playoffs for the second year in a row,  
losing in the second round to San Antonio after being beaten by 
Utah in the Western Conference finals last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers' courtship of Jackson was a whirlwind affair. The  
Lakers recently indicated that Rambis would be retained, but team 
owner Jerry Buss instead decided to spend more millions to go after 
the high-profile Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers began talking with Todd Musburger, Jackson's agent,  
last week. Jackson was off fishing in a remote area of Alaska, and 
Lakers executives West and Mitch Kupchak offered him the job in a 
telephone call Monday, after he returned to Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	He obviously was easy to woo, quickly deciding to take the job.  
</P>

for presidential candidate Bill Bradley, his former Knicks 
teammate.

<HEADLINE> Sabres Figure Out Nieuwendyk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Every shift he took, every shot he tried, every  
stride he took, Joe Nieuwendyk of the Dallas Stars kept seeing the 
same face. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Peca here. Michael Peca there. Michael Peca, it seemed,  
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	To shut down Nieuwendyk, the hottest scorer in the  
lowest-scoring Stanley Cup finals in 30 years, Buffalo Sabres coach 
Lindy Ruff made two key strategic changes in Game 4 Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both worked exceptionally well, and were a major reason why the  
series returned to Dallas tied 2-2 going into Game 5 Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first three games, the Sabres' No. 1 line of Dixon Ward,  
Peca and Vaclav Varada almost exclusively opposed the Stars' top 
line of Brett Hull, Mike Modano and Jere Lehtinen. 
</P>
<P>
	With Hull out Tuesday with a groin injury, Ruff switched the  
Peca line to oppose Nieuwendyk, who scored both goals in Dallas' 
2-1 victory in Game 3. Ruff also made sure the line played shorter 
shifts to match the Stars' quick line changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were evident. Nieuwendyk, who has 11 playoff goals  
and six game-winners; Jamie Langenbrunner and Dave Reid combined 
for only four of the Stars' 31 shots and no goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Nieuwendyk got off only a single shot in 18 minutes, 12 seconds  
of playing time, a slap shot that goaltender Dominik Hasek turned 
away in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
	In his previous nine games, Nieuwendyk had produced 12 points,  
including five goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nieuwendyk's line is so strong down low,'' Ward said  
Wednesday. ``Nieuwendyk's too good to totally take him out of the 
game, he's just too talented. But we did a better job of keeping 
them to the outside and limiting their chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff had the advantage of making the last line change at home  
and used it to make sure Peca opposed every Nieuwendyk shift in the 
third period. He won't have that edge on the road Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stars coach Ken Hitchcock questions if it will make a  
difference, saying the Nieuwendyk line played well even if it 
didn't score. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had as much bite as they did any other time,'' Hitchcock  
said Wednesday. ```We don't mind that matchup at all. It's a good 
matchup maybe for both teams. We're not going to change that 
matchup at all -- we like it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was some time at the start of the game where some of the  
players got after us physically but, toward the end of the game, if 
you look at the chances for us scoring-wise, Nieuwendyk's line was 
in the middle of most of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, if Hull returns, Ruff must decide if he can afford to  
concentrate his best line, Peca's, against the Stars' No. 2 line, 
especially in a series in which one mistake can cost a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, as in Tuesday's game, two mistakes. Both Sabres goals  
resulted from Stars turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got some great individuals on that team, and they're  
an extremely hard-working team,'' Ruff said Wednesday. ``We have to 
match their work ethic. Both goalies are playing tremendous, and 
it's inch by inch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nieuwendyk must have felt the same way while trying to find open  
ice against Peca's line. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to be physical and not allow them to outwork us down  
low,'' Peca said. ``They do a great job of outworking a lot of 
lines and creating good chances in front of the net. We felt good 
with the matchup most of the night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peca's line also contributed its first even-strength goal. Ward  
intercepted defenseman Craig Ludwig's soft pass in the slot and 
scored the game-winner in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal might have resulted in part from the shorter shifts,  
which allowed the Sabres to expend more energy defensively. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a solid effort, top to bottom,'' Ward said Wednesday,  
before the Sabres boarded their charter plane to Dallas. ``We're 
going to have to sustain that emotion and intensity if we're going 
to have any chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither team looks for the pace to accelerate in what now is a  
best-of-3 series, especially considering final scores of 3-2, 4-2, 
2-1 and 2-1 in the first four games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two goals are pretty good,'' Ruff said. ``Three are  
phenomenal.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Jumps After Prices Don't / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened sharply higher today, drawing  
strength from a consumer price report that calmed investor fears 
about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 134.24 at 10,729.23. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 21.87 at 1,323.03, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
up 62.43 at 2,477.10. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported that May consumer prices excluding  
the volatile energy and food categories rose a modest 0.1 percent. 
Clothing and auto prices declined, and medical and housing costs 
edged up. 
</P>
<P>
	The markets had been anxiously awaiting today's report, which is  
seen as a gauge of inflation in the prospering economy, after a 
surge in April's Consumer Price Index helped prompt the Federal 
Reserve to warn it would might boost interest rates. The Fed's 
policy-setting Open Market Committee next meets June 29-30. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's report helped alleviate some of the markets' concerns.  
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, the annual rate of inflation felt by consumers  
is 2.6 percent, compared to a 1.6 percent rise for all of 1998, the 
smallest in a dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered declining by a 8-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 116.34 million 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 7.92 at 630.20, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was 3.12 at 767.04. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell .32 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.40 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up .33 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 
1.05 percent.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Falls; Corn, Soybeans Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures prices retreated early today on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, while corn and soybean futures edged 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures retreated after the government reported another  
week of relatively weak export sales. There has also been 
speculation that China's competing crop may be significantly larger 
than previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans bounced higher following Wednesday's sharp  
losses, but prices were expected to remain under pressure from 
expectations for beneficial growing weather over the next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 1 cent to $2.58 a bushel; July corn  
rose 3/4 cent to $2.15 a bushel; July oats fell 1 cent to $1.19 1/4 a 
bushel; July soybeans rose 1 cent to $4.64 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Lean  
hogs retreated, while pork bellies edged higher. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle was unchanged at 64.67 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .08 cent to 77.95 cents a pound; July lean hogs

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Bank Confirms Resignations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Deutsche Bank AG has confirmed the resignation  
of Richard H. Daniel, who had been the chief financial officer at 
Bankers Trust Corp. during an investigation of irregularities 
before the New York bank was acquired by the German bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Bank said Daniel, who could not be reached on  
Wednesday, resigned ``to pursue other interests.'' A source close 
to the situation, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he had 
been fired. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, about a dozen other Bankers Trust officials will be  
let go this week, said Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Macy Egerton. She 
declined to confirm that the departures were related to Daniel's. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Bank had said in a federal filing that it may fire  
Bankers Trust executives for failing to act appropriately in 
investigating an illegal funds transfer. But Deutsche Bank had also 
said that as many as 5,500 people could be let go in New York and 
London over the next three years as a result of the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel, 53, joined Bankers Trust in 1996. He was tapped to help  
investigate allegations that between 1994 and 1996, former bank 
officials had improperly transferred $19.1 million in unclaimed 
customer funds to the bank's reserves in order to boost its 
earnings performance. The unclaimed funds legally should have been 
turned over to New York and other states. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankers Trust earlier this year pleaded guilty to three felony  
counts and agreed to pay a $63 million fine in connection with the 
illegal transfers. 
</P>
<P>
	Criminal charges are expected to be filed against those  
involved, although Bankers Trust has publicly said that none of 
those individuals still work for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel was not involved in the scheme, but his handling of the  
investigation has come under scrutiny. As part of an application by 
Deutsche Bank to manage certain U.S. retirement accounts, it was 
disclosed that the Labor Department is considering the appointment 
of an outside examiner. The examiner would consider whether Bankers 
Trust executives, including Daniel, properly oversaw the 
investigation and discipline of those involved. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, while Daniel was chief financial officer, Bankers Trust  
took a $20 million charge against earnings to replace the money to 
dormant customer accounts, calling it at the time only an 
``accounting'' charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Frankfurt State Prosecutor's Office in Germany  
said about 400 Deutsche Bank AG clients admitted investing money 
abroad to evade German tax obligations, prompting proceedings 
against the bank's senior management, including Chairman Rolf 
Breuer. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation into Deutsche Bank's tax affairs began last  
year as tax officials searched premises and secured documents.

<HEADLINE> Limited Partners: Nightmare of '80s? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Many experienced investors consider limited  
partnerships the nightmare investment of the 1980s. With the 
revival of real estate in the last few years, some of the old 
partnerships are beginning to show signs of new life. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, the revival may be just the time for older investors  
still clinging to limited partnerships to do the unthinkable -- walk 
away, said a tax expert at the College for Financial Planning. 
</P>
<P>
	Publicly registered limited partnerships were formed by the  
thousands in the '80s, mainly for the purpose of buying real estate 
and oil and gas properties. When both markets slumped, so did the 
income from limited partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding a decent resale market for faltering partnerships was  
difficult, so many investors simply hung on to them. The 
partnerships became ``passive losses'' because their owners took no 
active role in management, and they were used to offset other 
passive income, such as rental property income. 
</P>
<P>
	For those who didn't have sufficient passive income to offset,  
the losses were suspended and simply piled up each year. 
</P>
<P>
	As real estate values climb, and the tax benefits from  
depreciating the real estate held by partnerships all these years 
finally comes to an end for many, the partnerships are selling off 
their old property. 
</P>
<P>
	However, instead of returning that money to investors in the  
form of cash, the partnerships often are buying new properties. The 
payoffs from the new properties may not occur until five to ten 
years into the future. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the limited partners must often pay tax on  
phantom income from the sale of the properties -- that is, they are 
paying taxes on the profits yet not receiving those profits in the 
form of cash. 
</P>
<P>
	``For investors who are older and often in higher income tax  
brackets, they may not want to stick around for cash to finally 
come out, while paying taxes on phantom income in the interim,'' 
says Victoria Long, an accountant and academic associate at the 
College. 
</P>
<P>
	Assuming you want to dispose of your limited partnership  
interests, you basically have two choices, says Long. 
</P>
<P>
	One, you can sell or exchange your interest in the partnership.  
Presuming the sale nets you less money than your total investment, 
you can deduct the capital loss against capital gains earned in the 
same tax year you take the loss. If the capital loss exceeds your 
capital gains, you can then deduct up to another $3,000 in capital 
losses against ordinary income. Any remaining capital losses can be 
carried over into future tax years. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem with selling or exchanging many of these interests,  
particularly ones generating phantom income, is finding willing 
buyers. Assuming you can't find a buyer, says Long, your other 
option is to abandon the interest -- simply walk away from it. 
</P>
<P>
	While that may sound like a bad idea, the big advantage of  
abandoning limited partnership interests is that if it is properly 
done the loss can be classified as ordinary and can be deducted 
against ordinary income without the limitations placed on capital 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	This typically is much easier to accomplish than trying to  
generate passive income, and it may provide better tax benefits for 
higher income investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trick is making sure you abandon the property in  
compliance with federal regulations and rulings,'' says Long. 
</P>
<P>
	The first key, she says, is to make clear to the partnership  
your intention to abandon the interest. She recommends spelling 
this out in a letter and sending it via certified mail to the 
general partner. 
</P>
<P>
	The second key, according to Long, is to not take any  
compensation -- however small -- for abandoning the property. Taking 
compensation allows you to still deduct the loss against capital 
gains, but you lose the ability to take a potentially more valuable 
write-off against your ordinary income. 
</P>
<P>
	One potential obstacle is that if you have any recourse  
liabilities from the partnership, abandoning the interests -- and 
thus releasing you from the liabilities -- will be deemed a form of 
compensation and you will be able to take only capital losses. 
Fortunately, says Long, many of the real estate limited 
partnerships from the '80s carried no recourse liabilities for the 
limited partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Another issue, says Long, is that you need to be sure you time  
the abandonment of the property within the same tax year you have 
sufficient ordinary income to offset the losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors in limited partnerships will probably want to consult  
an investment and tax adviser before making their decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Says Long: ``They'll want to look at the dollar amount they have  
in suspended losses, and then look at the potential for actual cash 
flow versus phantom income. Some older investors in higher income 
tax bracket may find it's not worth playing a waiting game.''

<HEADLINE> Parton, Twitty Named to Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Dolly Parton and Conway Twitty will be  
the newest members of the Country Music Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	The Country Music Association announced the inductees Wednesday  
at Fan Fair, an annual festival. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a great honor. I really am surprised,'' Ms. Parton said  
in a statement. ``I thought I'd have to be as old as Roy Acuff or 
as ugly as Willie Nelson to get in the Hall of Fame. Just kidding, 
Willie! It truly is a great honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twitty, who had a string of hits beginning in the late 1950s,  
died in 1993. Johnny Bond, a singing cowboy who appeared in films 
with Roy Rogers and Gene Autry, was also chosen. He died in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	The three will be inducted Sept. 22 at the Grand Ole Opry House.

<HEADLINE> GOP Veers Rightward on Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Speaker Dennis Hastert is steering  
Republicans rightward, angling toward a budget confrontation with 
President Clinton that will let the GOP advertise its fiscally 
conservative roots. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't look for a replay of 1995, when the new Republican  
majority tried cramming its budget-cutting agenda down Clinton's 
throat. GOP lawmakers and the world around them have evolved, and 
they hope this year to polish their conservative credentials by 
producing lean spending bills, and demonstrate pragmatism by 
compromising with Clinton in the end. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, they hope, will involve giving him some of the $30  
billion more he wants for health, schools and other domestic 
programs in exchange for tax cuts or something else. They think 
that by then, Clinton will have demonstrated through word and veto 
that he is the one insisting on using Social Security surpluses for 
additional spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're only one part of this democracy,'' Hastert, R-Ill., said  
last week in a brief interview. ``There's the other side of the 
aisle, there's the Senate, there's the president. Everybody has to 
agree to that. If we don't, there's different accommodations that 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a legislative process,'' said House Whip Tom DeLay,  
R-Texas, perhaps the House's most combative leader. ``It has to 
work its will. We'll push it as far as we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's a big difference from 1995.  
</P>
<P>
	Then, Republicans under Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., spoke  
openly about using veto fights and federal shutdowns to force 
Clinton to surrender and sign spending bills as written by 
Republicans. They tried, and two shutdowns later found they had 
whipped up the public against themselves, not the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anybody's willing to do that'' now, said Rep.  
Steve Largent, R-Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	The fiery Gingrich has been replaced by the more  
consensus-minded Hastert. Gingrich's initial goals were to change 
Washington's entire culture of give-and-take while dramatically 
paring down the government; Hastert began his tenure saying he 
wanted Congress to get its spending bills passed on time. 
</P>
<P>
	Different, too, is the GOP freshman class elected in November  
1994, one of the driving forces in that confrontational 1995. Its 
original 73 members are down to 51 in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	As their numbers have dwindled, so has their take-no-prisoners  
attitude, leavened by 4 1/2 years in Capitol Hill's deal-cutting 
world. Some of them are members of the party leadership, some are 
subcommittee chairmen, and few speak any longer with scorn of the 
compromises that make Washington run under divided government. 
</P>
<P>
	``A fair number of our class has gone native,'' laments Rep.  
Mark Sanford, R-S.C., a Class of '94 survivor. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP's majority also has shrunk. When Election Night 1994 was  
over, Republicans held a 230-204 advantage over Democrats, with one 
Democrat-leaning independent. That margin is now down to 223-211-1, 
which means defections by six Republicans can spell GOP defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	As Republican strength has diminished, the power of their chief  
adversary has increased, almost paradoxically. 
</P>
<P>
	When Republicans took control of Congress in 1995 after 40 years  
of Democratic rule, a confused Clinton was reduced to asserting his 
relevancy. More than four years later -- despite his impeachment -- 
Clinton has proven his political mastery over his frequently 
divided adversaries so often that Republicans are always wary of 
tangling with him. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the budget reality that fueled the GOP drive to cut  
spending has turned topsy-turvy. 
</P>
<P>
	When Republicans captured Congress in 1994, there had been  
annual federal deficits exceeding $100 billion for 13 straight 
years. The public was ready for tight fiscal policies. 
</P>
<P>
	But this year, the government is certain to run its second  
consecutive surplus, making the spending cuts Hastert wants a 
tougher sell to voters. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, rebellious conservatives might try to scuttle a  
compromise with Clinton if they believe it surrenders too much or 
achieves too little. But for now, they appear ready to consider a 
deal -- as long as the initial bills reflect the GOP's 
smaller-government philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no alternative,'' said Largent. ``We don't control  
the White House.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> GM, UAW Leaders Begin Contract Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- When leaders of General Motors Corp.  
and the United Auto Workers met Wednesday to start the long process 
of negotiating a new national contract, there was no sign of the 
acrimony that has long marked their relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Just the opposite: It was all smiles and comments chosen to  
offend nobody. Quite remarkable, too, since just last summer the 
world's largest automaker and its biggest union were embroiled in a 
pair of costly strikes that only made their bad relationship worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess the days of everybody beatin' the drum and rattling  
the swords are gone,'' UAW President Stephen P. Yokich told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary L. Cowger, the executive GM brought in to repair its union  
relations, repeated the policy that GM adopted shortly after the 
strikes, which cost it about $2 billion in lost revenue and a chunk 
of market share it has yet to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've said since last summer that it is of utmost importance  
to the top leadership of this company to improve our communications 
with the UAW,'' Cowger said. ``We continue to work on that and 
continue to make that a focus and a priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even cynical UAW leaders said they were now convinced GM was  
serious. Richard Shoemaker, the union's chief GM negotiator, said 
the relationship has changed considerably since the strikes, but 
that the change has yet to filter down to the plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, that's where it ultimately has to get to for it to  
be successful, and I think it would be premature to say it's 
reached that point yet,'' he said. ``I also think it would be 
unfair not to say that I believe there's a sincere interest in 
doing just that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM had good reason to dump its get-tough stance. It need only  
look to rival Ford Motor Co., which has not had a national contract 
strike in 23 years and is the industry's poster company for good 
union relations. Ford today is the most profitable of Detroit's 
automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's strikes were largely over plant work rules and the  
loss of work to outside suppliers, issues that will be back on the 
table in these national negotiations. The focus of the work-rule 
debate is expected to be GM's plans to adopt ``modular assembly'' 
techniques at its small-car plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Modular assembly uses outside, lower-cost suppliers to do more  
subassembly work. The suppliers deliver to the plant large parts 
``modules,'' such as an entire preassembled door or dashboard. As a 
result, fewer high-wage UAW workers are needed for final assembly 
of the car. 
</P>
<P>
	The future of workers at GM's former parts subsidiary, Delphi  
Automotive Systems Corp., also is a key issue in these 
negotiations. GM divested Delphi in an initial public offering and 
stock transfer earlier this year, over the union's objections. 
</P>
<P>
	As a concession to the union, GM and Delphi have agreed to keep  
Delphi workers under terms of the new GM contract for at least the 
next three years, according to sources on both sides who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The triennial contract talks with Detroit's automakers began  
Monday at Ford Motor Co. and were followed Tuesday by an initial 
meeting at DaimlerChrysler AG. The talks will continue through the 
summer and intensify in early September when the union will pick a 
lead company to negotiate economic issues. The current three-year 
pacts expire Sept. 14.

<HEADLINE> Six Cities Vie For Olympic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The Poles and Slovaks brought  
musicians dressed in alpine outfits, the Italians brought Olympic 
gold medalist Alberto Tomba and the Finns were described as 
hardworking and ``a little bit crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race for the 2006 Winter Games took center stage at Olympic  
meetings Wednesday, with the six European cities holding news 
conferences to promote their bids -- a warmup for Friday's official 
presentations to the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	An IOC panel will reduce the field to two finalists on Saturday,  
and the general assembly will then choose the winner by secret 
ballot. Sion, Switzerland, is the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Delegates for first-time and longshot bidder Zakopane argued  
that Poland has become one of central Europe's economic tigers with 
an annual growth rate of 5 to 7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Poland has championed the democratic transition in Europe and  
showed its effectiveness,'' Polish delegate Krysztof Gorlich said. 
``We not only are a stable democracy, but have dealt with our 
economic problems effectively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gorlich said it was time for the IOC to take the games to a  
region of Europe where they have never been held. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think we are ready, and it would be good for the Olympic  
movement to expand a little into new territories, become more 
universal,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bid delegates from Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia, pulled on hockey  
jerseys for their briefing and ended with a word from Peter 
Stastny, an NHL Hall of Famer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Slovaks said the republic has stabilized politically and  
economically since throwing off communism 10 years ago and 
considers the Olympics as a way to fully reintegrate back into the 
community of Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting the Olympic Games would be one of the nicest gifts we  
could receive ... we could maybe jump ahead 20 years,'' said 
Stastny, a former Quebec Nordiques star. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would tremendously help a country that came from 45 years  
of communist regime ... help to push us back to where we belong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tomba, appearing on behalf of the bid from Turin, Italy, was  
more succinct: ``I would like to say something about the Olympics 
in Turin -- why not?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turin is the largest city competing for the 2006 games and the  
largest city in the arc of the Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	Bidders from Helsinki noted that most of their facilities are  
already in place and said ``the love of sports'' in Finland and 
Norway would ensure large audiences. Because Finland has no 
mountains, the alpine events would be held in Lillehammer, Norway, 
host of the 1994 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever the Finns do, they do well,'' Marit Myramael of  
Norway's Olympic Committee said. ``They are hardworking, they are 
stimulating and they are a little bit crazy -- that's why we like to 
work with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delegates of Klagenfurt, Austria, pushed the strong symbolism of  
their ``games without borders'' concept that includes sites in 
neighboring Slovenia and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bid officials from several of the cities said they were put at a  
disadvantage by the ban on visits by IOC members instituted in the 
wake of the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Direct contact is much better than seeing the city on video or  
in pictures,'' Turin bid official Marco San Pietro said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italians said the ban on visits favored Sion since more than  
60 IOC members visited the Swiss town during its failed bid for the 
2002 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear we have an advantage because we were a candidate  
for 2002,'' Sion bid director Jean-Daniel Mudry said. ``But we 
regret the visits were canceled. We improved our bid since the last 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Olympic newsletter Sport Intern, published in Germany,  
ranked Sion as the top bid, followed by Helsinki, Turin, 
Klagenfurt, Poprad-Tatry and Zakopane. 
</P>
<P>
	Helsinki's No. 2 ranking came as a surprise to those who have  
considered Turin as Sion's main challenger. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he believed Sion was the frontrunner, Mudry  
demurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``In sports, it's not always the favorite who wins,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Shootings Fuel Racism Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Police shoot and kill two young, unarmed blacks.  
Protesters converge on City Hall. The Rev. Al Sharpton calls a 
rally at police headquarters. Black leaders denounce racism in 
police ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	The scenario may sound familiar, but these cases have a twist:  
The officers who pulled the trigger are black. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Chicago's police department, which has long promoted  
minority hiring as a way to stamp out racism, is struggling with 
whether minority officers can be racist. 
</P>
<P>
	The notion isn't so farfetched, according to some black veteran  
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``In policing, the description of a good police officer is that  
of a white male, so the whole philosophy, the whole culture there 
is white,'' said Ronald Hampton, a retired Washington, D.C., police 
officer and executive director of the National Black Police 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Hampton said police often get the impression that minorities  
commit most crimes. And that in turn makes officers -- regardless of 
race -- more likely to target minorities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the Chicago shootings this month, Robert Russ, a  
22-year-old Northwestern University football player, was killed 
when he tried to grab a gun an officer pointed inside his car after 
a chase, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other case, LaTanya Haggerty, 26, a passenger in a car  
involved in a chase after a routine traffic stop, was shot after an 
officer mistook her cellular phone for a gun, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago police union has defended the officers, noting a  
split second of hesitation can mean the difference between life and 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics claim the officers wouldn't have been so quick to  
draw their guns if the people involved had been white. They wonder 
why police allegedly smashed out a tinted window of Russ' car and 
pointed a gun inside instead of waiting for him to come out. And 
they want to know whether police ignored orders to call off the 
chase in Ms. Haggerty's case. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Superintendent Terry Hillard, who is black, has some of  
the same questions. He has promised a thorough investigation and 
cooperation in probes by the Justice Department and Cook County 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hillard has bristled at suggestions that the shootings were  
racially motivated. He said the department has rules against 
``racial profiling,'' or stopping drivers simply because of their 
race. And he said those who break the rules will be punished. 
</P>
<P>
	Some black leaders say more rules won't solve the problem.  
</P>
<P>
	``Even black officers are afraid of black people,'' said the  
Rev. James T. Meeks, director of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition's 
minister's division. ``That just shows you how bad it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meeks and other black members of the clergy want an independent  
agency to give police officers racial sensitivity training. They 
also want Hillard and black officers to keep a higher public 
profile. 
</P>
<P>
	As of 1997, one in four Chicago police officers was black. About  
39 percent of the city's population was black as of the last 
census. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes people in the black community are suspicious of me.  
I prove myself to them,'' said one black officer, Sgt. Doris Byrd, 
a 23-year veteran of the force. ``A lot of members of our 
African-American community have been mistreated at the hands of 
African-Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hillard conceded that the police department has a ``credibility  
gap'' with the black community. He said he will work harder to 
prove that police are there to protect and serve, not harass and 
discriminate. 
</P>
<P>
	One person who might need convincing is 14-year-old Ola  
Williams, who lives in the South Side neighborhood where Ms. 
Haggerty was shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing in front of the iron gates of a housing project near  
the shooting site, Ms. Williams said she has been hassled by police 
officers both black and white. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't treat you no different. It's all the same,'' Ms.  
Williams said. ``They treat you like dirt.''

<HEADLINE> Allen Clings to Tool Man Character </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- If Tim Allen were a tool, he would  
probably be a vise. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen doesn't let go of things easily, and that includes his  
recently ended ``Home Improvement'' sitcom. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike many actors who desperately try to shed their character's  
persona when a series ends, Allen remains firmly clamped to his 
role as Tim ``The Tool Man'' Taylor, using it to promote a 
signature line of hammers, drills and other hardware equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	He even stores a huge chunk of the ``Home Improvement'' set at  
his Burbank office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like throwing stuff out,'' Allen said. ``I have so  
much memorabilia from 'Home Improvement,' that eventually I'll just 
have to have a yard sale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Letting go of ``Home Improvement,'' which aired its final  
episode on May 25, was difficult for the 46-year-old actor, who 
talks wistfully about the cast and crew as though they were high 
school chums rather than co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I even gave everybody class rings, and the staff gave  
everybody yearbooks,'' he said. ``So it looks like we all 
graduated. I think of it like that. ... like an alma mater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elaborate collection of wooden walls, worktables and  
swinging garage-style doors from the show's fictional ``Tool Time'' 
do-it-yourself program stands near his fleet of vintage cars in the 
garage portion of his office building. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't get enough of it,'' he said. ``I don't wallow in my  
memories, but the show was such a wonderful memory that I want to 
hold onto the experience. And all I have left is this material.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nearly 40-foot set's plywood backing bears the signatures of  
some of the show's crew, and notable props hang on the front, such 
as a calendar featuring ``Tool Time's'' buxom spokesmodel and a 
cutout reindeer head with a Rudolph-style taillight nose. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they delivered the set, it was too big. I had no idea  
what to do with it,'' Allen said. ``I had grips come over to my 
building and put it up, the doors, the backdrop, the whole thing. 
... Then I was sitting in it the other day saying, 'I don't think 
this is a good thing.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his role as a hapless space captain in the upcoming  
sci-fi comedy ``Galaxy Quest'' keeps him from dwelling on the end 
of ``Home Improvement,'' although he misses the ABC-TV show around 
this time of year because other programs have started shooting 
episodes for next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm on fire now,'' he said of his busy schedule. ``I'll  
probably miss the show more in the fall when things quiet down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides appearing in ``Galaxy Quest,'' a futuristic movie about  
a group of sci-fi actors who are mistaken for real heroes, Allen is 
also reprising his role as the voice of spaceman doll Buzz 
Lightyear in the upcoming ``Toy Story'' sequel with Tom Hanks. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his only career worry is that the two movies may open in  
competition with each other. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, he tinkers in the design process of Tim Allen  
Signature Tools and is actively promoting the line for Father's 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which donates its profits to children's charities,  
produces hammers, power drills, screwdrivers, utility knives and 
outdoor equipment like leaf-blowers and hedge-trimmers. 
</P>
<P>
	OK, so does Allen -- who is currently restoring three more  
vintage cars -- use his own stuff? 
</P>
<P>
	Allen said he prefers to keep the tools as collector's items,  
even though they come with a tag imploring buyers to ``Please use 
it!'' 
</P>
<P>
	He would rather use his grandfather's old tools for household  
work, he said, like the ``greasy screwdrivers with the clear, 
yellow plastic handles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Does Allen love fixing things?  
</P>
<P>
	Instead of buying a new table, he repaired a broken leg on one  
dumped on him by his mother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	He even tracked down the maker of his daughter's inexpensive  
digital watch so they could repair the item, which he said was 
``practically worthless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is something wonderful about taking the effort -- and  
it's physical effort, my energy -- to recycle components of our 
lives,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen acknowledged that just about everything he does has a  
sense of nostalgia to it. 
</P>
<P>
	His office is a grown-up version of what his boyhood bedroom may  
have looked like, complete with his fleet of cars -- only these are 
the real things, not models. 
</P>
<P>
	The walls are decorated with old James Bond movie posters and  
1950s-era sci-fi memorabilia, including life-size replicas of the 
friendly, fishbowl-headed Robbie the Robot and the towering alien 
annihilator Gort from the movie ``The Day the Earth Stood Still.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hanging on one wall are photographs of several space shuttle  
missions that are signed by NASA crew members. 
</P>
<P>
	A photo of Buzz Aldrin walking on the moon is signed with the  
message: ``from the REAL Buzz,'' referring to Allen's ``Toy Story'' 
character. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he relishes his new role in his boyhood passion of  
science fiction, Allen said he hopes the tool line will keep him 
firmly rooted in the public's eye as a sort of modern-day Ward 
Cleaver, noting that ``Home Improvement'' was one of the last 
family-based sitcoms on network television. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing like it on television anymore,'' he said.  
``And at heart, that's who I am -- just a very simple guy.''

<HEADLINE> Fraud Lawsuit Filed Against Sears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDWARDSVILLE, Ill. (AP) -- Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. collected up to  
$400 million for tire balancing services it never performed, then 
paid millions to keep the fraud quiet, according to a lawsuit filed 
in Madison County Circuit Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Tuesday, also claims managers destroyed the  
tire-balancing machines with sledgehammers to cover up the fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint, which seeks class-action status, estimates 7  
million to 30 million people who purchased Sears AccuBalance 
service from 1989 to 1994 were potentially defrauded. 
</P>
<P>
	The balancing machines were used to shave off a tiny layer of  
rubber to make sure the tires were round. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears workers typically charged $12.50 to process each tire but  
often skipped the procedure, which was impossible for the buyer to 
detect, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	It also contends Sears management knew that most of the  
balancing services never were performed, but pressured employees to 
sell the services anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Stephen Katz, who represents the plaintiffs, said he  
believes Sears failed to do the work up to 90 percent of the time 
in its 800 tire stores nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears spokesman David Albritton declined comment today on the  
lawsuit, which he said the company had not seen. 
</P>
<P>
	But he noted the case is the same as a federal lawsuit pending  
in Tampa, Fla. That lawsuit was filed in September 1991, thrown out 
and recently reinstated late last year by a federal appeals court 
that ruled notices Sears sent in 1992 for reimbursement of 
``unnecessary and/or improper repairs'' were too vague to be 
understood. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit accuses Sears of paying almost $30 million in ``hush  
money'' to buy the silence of the machine's manufacturer, Assix 
International Inc., of Tampa, Fla., after that company's workers 
reported significant discrepancies between the services Sears sold 
and the work recorded by mechanical counters on the machines. 
</P>
<P>
	Assix leased about 1,300 machines to Sears for $300 per month  
each, plus a royalty of 15 cents on every tire shaved, according to 
court documents. Sears paid Assix based on cash register receipts 
and not the counters, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Sears paid $30 million in cash and property for a $6  
million contract termination settlement and to acquire the 
AccuBalance machines, the lawsuit contends. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit alleges that Sears, based in the Chicago suburb of  
Hoffman Estates, distributed a ``secret video tape'' telling 
workers to destroy the machines and the counters with 
sledgehammers, then sell the remains for scrap. It claims Sears 
also acquired all Assix paperwork regarding its AccuBalance 
machines as part of ``massive cover-up efforts.''

<HEADLINE> Teens Clean Up After Okla Tornadoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGE CREEK, Okla. (AP) -- One lost her home in the Oklahoma  
tornadoes. The other survived the Columbine High School shootings 
in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet when Sarah Fisicaro and Melissa Varner met here Tuesday,  
they said they were just 17-year-olds ready to pick up tornado 
debris in Melissa's hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	There wasn't any talk about their tragedies. Just work, side by  
side, their ponytails swaying in the wind. Sometimes they laughed 
at shoes getting stuck in the red Oklahoma mud. 
</P>
<P>
	Just two months ago, Sarah hid in a science room as two of her  
classmates killed 12 students, a teacher and themselves. Two of her 
close friends died. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, she wore her Columbine cap as she combed through the  
tornado debris where a home once stood, Melissa right next to her. 
They looked for anything the half-mile twister left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa lost her home and her community in the May 3 tornadoes.  
Twelve of the 44 Oklahomans who died were from Bridge Creek, making 
it the hardest hit area. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're here to work. It's not about the `shooting kids' meeting  
the `tornado kids,''' Melissa said. ``We all know the bad stuff 
that happened to us. We're just moving on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 30 Littleton teen-agers, two of whom go to Columbine High,  
are part of a youth group from Foothills Bible Church. They 
coordinated the cleanup with the youth group from Ridgecrest 
Baptist Church. Groups from other parts of Oklahoma and Texas also 
were there. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like an extended family,'' said Tom Duckett, the  
Ridgecrest minister. 
</P>
<P>
	When the groups arrived at Ridgecrest, they found a chest-high  
pile of rubble -- the church. The teen-agers sang and prayed before 
dividing into teams. 
</P>
<P>
	One team formed a human chain as it combed through 14-year-old  
Jared Simmons' yard. A slab of concrete marked where his home was. 
Jared didn't need to explain to the Columbine visitors his grief. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we kinda know how it is without saying anything,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarah said she will talk about what happened at Columbine if  
someone wants to know, but she is here to help Oklahomans and share 
her faith. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to escape what happened at Columbine,'' she said.  
``But, we can pray together.''

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Appeals Ore. Cable Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. asked a federal appeals court  
Wednesday for a quick ruling on whether the city can force it to 
open up its recently acquired high-speed cable lines to Internet 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The telecommunications giant, which acquired Tele-Communications  
Inc.'s cable television system in February, wants to use the TCI 
franchise in Portland to offer high-speed access to the Internet, 
along with video and phone services. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. District Judge Owen Panner ruled June 4 that AT&AMP;T must  
also offer its network to rivals that want to provide similar 
services, as requested by the city and surrounding Multnomah 
County. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were obviously disappointed in the decision but pretty  
confident that we had the better legal arguments and that we'd be 
able to turn this around on appeal,'' said Mark Rosenblum, a lawyer 
for AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	The case could set a nationwide precedent, allowing other local  
authorities to require similar conditions in the absence of 
intervention by Congress or the Federal Communications Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The convergence of cable TV and telephone systems has presented  
a new challenge for the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, FCC Chairman William Kennard told a cable TV  
convention in Chicago that cable companies should be monitored on 
the federal level, not regulated as they move to offer high-speed 
Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable companies -- now including AT&AMP;T -- that have invested  
billions to build super-fast Internet networks to handle video, 
computer data and phone calls have resisted efforts to allow 
slower-moving competitors such as America Online to share the 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenblum said the city of Portland was violating federal law by  
trying to force AT&AMP;T to run its cable network like a telephone 
company, or ``common carrier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Portland Commissioner Erik Sten said there is no way you can  
separate phone and cable lines anymore, and the FCC or Congress is 
eventually going to have to step in. 
</P>
<P>
	``The city has thought all along the ideal way to solve this  
would be a national policy,'' Sten said. ``But when this started, 
we couldn't even get a call from the FCC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts agreed the federal government eventually will have to  
resolve the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more successful AT&AMP;T is at selling cable modems, the  
stronger the argument to force them to act like a common carrier,'' 
said Rex Mitchell at Banc of America Securities in San Francisco. 
``The greater their success, the quicker their doom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its request to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San  
Francisco for an expedited hearing, AT&AMP;T also argues the city of 
Portland and Multnomah County violated its First Amendment right to 
decide what programs and content they offer subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell, however, finds the constitutional argument weaker than  
the AT&AMP;T claim that local governments lack the authority to control 
Internet service providers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very interesting case,'' Mitchell said. ``It's going to  
influence the value of companies like AOL in the future, and how 
they're used in the homes. It's going to shape the future 
Internet.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't Ownership of Waste Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After five-years of stalemate, Senate  
Republicans appear to have abandoned the congressional push to 
create a temporary storage facility in Nevada for thousands of tons 
of nuclear waste now at reactors around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Rep. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, planned today to  
propose a compromise that the government take title to the waste, 
but leave it at the reactor sites. It is an alternative that only a 
few months ago was soundly rejected by the nuclear industry and its 
supporters on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee was to vote on  
the measure at a meeting today. Murkowski, the panel's chairman 
said he was confident of getting it through. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson floated a proposal in February  
for the government to take title to the highly radioactive waste as 
long as it remained at reactor sites, arguing it was a reasonable 
compromise since President Clinton would veto any legislation 
calling for temporary storage of wastes in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has stymied Congress for five years or more as  
lawmakers seeking to resolve the waste problem at power plants 
repeatedly failed to get enough votes for a central storage 
facility in Nevada to overcome a threatened veto. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been there and done that,'' said Murkowski, adding that  
another approach was needed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Murkowski's proposal to leave the waste at the power plants  
until a permanent site is available has some conditions that may 
still pose problems. 
</P>
<P>
	For one, he said, he wants a requirement that the Nuclear  
Regulatory Commission set radiation exposure standards at a future 
permanent waste burial facility, instead of the Environmental 
Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA traditionally has pushed for more stringent standards,  
including a requirement to protect groundwater that the nuclear 
industry claims is impossible to meet. ``We need standards that are 
achievable,'' Murkowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, the ranking Democrat on the  
committee, said he wouldn't vote for the legislation if the EPA did 
not have jurisdiction over radiation standards at a future Yucca 
Mountain waste burial site in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department also considers the proposal to remove the  
EPA from setting the radiation standard ``a killer issue'' yet to 
be resolved, said a department official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	While Murkowski's proposal had not yet been analyzed in detail,  
said this official, ``it's progress because they're dropping the 
interim storage'' idea. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40,000 tons of highly radioactive waste -- generally  
used reactor fuel -- has built up at power plants in 34 states while 
Congress repeatedly has failed to enact a law requiring a temporary 
storage facility in Nevada, largely because the White House has 
threatened to veto the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has maintained that if a temporary facility is built it  
would slow the momentum to develop a permanent burial ground at 
Yucca Mountain, located about 90 miles from Las Vegas. The Yucca 
site is being evaluated, but even if approved will not be ready to 
accept shipments until 2010, and possibly later. 
</P>
<P>
	Murkowski and Richardson discussed the waste issue at length  
during a recent trip they made to Alaska. Richardson was said to 
have reiterated that the administration would not accept any 
legislation putting a temporary storage facility in Nevada. And 
Bingaman reinforced that argument with Murkowski in recent weeks, 
offering his own alternative to keep the waste at reactor sites but 
have the government take ownership.

<HEADLINE> Heart Drug Helps Defibrillators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A type of heart drug that had fallen out of favor has found a  
new use: helping defibrillators work better in people with faulty 
heart rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
	One new study found that people with implanted defibrillators  
reduced their risk of death and unnecessary electric shocks from 
the implants by 48 percent if they also took the drug sotalol. 
</P>
<P>
	A second study found that pre-treatment with the drug ibutilide  
greatly improved the chances that people with atrial fibrillation 
would resume a normal heart rhythm after being shocked with an 
external defibrillator. 
</P>
<P>
	Both studies were published in Thursday's New England Journal of  
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	About 350,000 sudden cardiac deaths occur in the United States  
every year. Most are thought to be caused by two types of heart 
rhythm disturbances: ventricular fibrillation or ventricular 
tachycardia. 
</P>
<P>
	Fibrillation occurs when heart muscle fibers twitch randomly.  
Tachycardia is an extremely rapid heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Implanted defibrillators are cassette tape-sized devices that  
shock the heart back into a normal rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotalol and ibutilide are Class III anti-arrhythmia drugs.  
Sotalol fell into disfavor after a study found two years ago that 
implanted defibrillators save many more lives. 
</P>
<P>
	But the latest study on sotalol, paid for by the drug's maker,  
Berlex Laboratories, found that it complements the defibrillators. 
The study involved 302 patients and was led by Dr. Antonio Pacifico 
of the Texas Arrhythmia Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	The other study, of ibutilide, looked at 100 patients. It was  
led by Dr. Hakan Oral at the University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	In an editorial, Dr. Philip Podrid of Boston University said  
that because of concerns about harmful side effects, use of the 
drugs should be confined to patients for whom other treatments are 
inadequate.

<HEADLINE> Francis Becomes Coyotes' Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- The Phoenix Coyotes appointed former  
Boston Bruins assistant Bobby Francis as the successor to Jim 
Schoenfeld today, completing a three-week search. 
</P>
<P>
	The hiring of Francis, 40, had been expected since he and the  
Coyotes settled Monday on a three-year contract believed to be 
worth $350,000 a year. The team publicly refused to confirm 
Francis' hiring, but Coyotes assistant John Tortorella, who was 
believed to be in the running, said that Francis had the job. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bobby Smith cited the Coyotes' ineffective power  
play, which ranked next-to-last in the NHL, and general lack of 
offense after the franchise's eighth consecutive first-round 
playoff exit and second straight under Schoenfeld. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix still owes Schoenfeld, who was fired May 25, about  
$400,000 for the final year of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coyotes had a 39-31-12 record this season for 90 points, the  
second most in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis spent the past two seasons as an assistant to Bruins  
coach Pat Burns. Boston returned to the playoffs this season, 
thanks in part to improved special teams play -- units that Francis 
directed. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston had the NHL's best penalty killing unit at 89.2 percent,  
and its power play ranked eighth (17.7 percent) and seventh on the 
road (18.2), 
</P>
<P>
	The Coyotes succeeded only 12 percent of their power plays, and  
a league-low 11.3 percent at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining Burns' staff, Francis had a 65-82-13 record in  
two seasons as coach of Providence of the American Hockey League, 
the Bruins' top affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a player-coach with Salt Lake City of the International  
Hockey League in 1986, and began a four-year run as coach of the 
Utah franchise, a Calgary affiliate, in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	When Calgary shifted its affiliation to St. John in 1993,  
Francis moved to St. John and remained there until he took over at 
Providence in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis also has a strong NHL coaching bloodline. His father  
Emile ``The Cat'' Francis won 277 NHL games during 13 seasons 
behind the bench with the New York Rangers (1965-75) and St. Louis 
Blues (1976-77, 1981-83).

<HEADLINE> Baptists Rebuke Clinton on Gays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Southern Baptists voted overwhelmingly today  
to urge President Clinton to rescind James Hormel's appointment as 
the nation's first openly gay ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the nation's largest Protestant denomination voted  
2,316 to 1,313 to ask Clinton to recall Hormel, who was appointed 
ambassador to Luxembourg two weeks ago in a maneuver that allowed 
him to bypass Senate confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to speak out and say we do not want an avowed  
homosexual to represent the U.S.,'' said the Rev. Wiley Drake of 
Buena Park, Calif., who wrote the 1997 resolution calling on 
Southern Baptists to boycott Disney because of its gay-friendly 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Hormel, a former dean of the University of Chicago law school,  
used part of his family's Hormel meatpacking fortune to help create 
the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian 
political group. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators had held up Hormel's nomination since 1997, but Clinton  
appointed Hormel while the Senate was in recess, angering religious 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	David Smith, a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, defended  
Hormel and called him a qualified and honorable man. ``It's become 
an annual convention event: Devote a day to gay bashing,'' Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the Baptists who opposed the Hormel resolution was Tommy  
Knotts, director of a missionary association in North Augusta, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``I trust my legislators to deny anything the president does  
that's out of order,'' he said. ``The denomination is better off 
not speaking out on these things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hormel's appointment was one of two issues related to  
homosexuality on the agenda at the Southern Baptists' two-day 
annual meeting, which ended Wednesday. The convention also rebuked 
Clinton -- who is a Southern Baptist -- for proclaiming June as Gay 
and Lesbian Pride Month. 
</P>
<P>
	Another motion asking that Clinton's home church, Immanuel  
Baptist Church in Little Rock, Ark., discipline him for supporting 
Gay and Lesbian Pride Month was ruled out of order Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The president of the Southern Baptists, the Rev. Paige  
Patterson, called it ``a thorny situation'' because members of 
Clinton's congregation ``want on the one hand to be lovingly 
responsive to every member of the church.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``By the same token, I'm sure there must be many of them that  
are very troubled by it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous conventions have been marked by tension between  
moderates and conservatives and have produced controversial 
pronouncements like the Disney boycott and the decision to target 
Jews for proselytizing. 
</P>
<P>
	This meeting in the Georgia Dome was far from contentious, as  
many moderates stayed home and the conservative Patterson was 
re-elected to a second one-year term without opposition. About 
11,000 of the nation's 16 million Southern Baptists attended. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Patterson said members -- who are mostly suburban and  
rural whites -- should increase recruitment in inner cities. 
Chicago, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Boston, Philadelphia and Seattle will 
be targeted over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	On the final day, the Southern Baptists also approved a  
resolution urging Congress, NATO and the United Nations to halt 
``genocide and ethnic cleansing'' in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Jerry Falwell, a longtime opponent of gay rights who  
joined the denomination last year, gave the benediction Wednesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Football star Reggie White, now a preacher who declared  
homosexuality a sin when he addressed the Wisconsin Legislature 
last year, received thunderous applause Wednesday night when he 
said condemning gays was God's idea, not his.

<TEXT>
<P>
	AT SEA ABOARD TSS STELLA SOLARIS (AP) -- It was a heaven-sent,  
brochure-promised, glorious day in the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Not a cloud in the sky. Hardly enough wind to churn up a  
whitecap or the stomach of a queasy passenger. In our bow wave, 
flying fish by the hundreds skipped across the turquoise waters in 
an iridescent arc, fleeing the menacing fin of a hammerhead shark. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the decks of the Stella Solaris were strangely deserted. No  
one was about, save for a sailor chipping paint and a late-rising 
couple seeking the solace of hot bouillon after greeting the dawn 
in the discotheque. No sun-worshippers by the pool, no bridge 
players in the card room. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Where was everyone?  
</P>
<P>
	Down in the theater, deep in the bowels of the ship near the  
anchor chain, listening as a team of lecturers headed by historian 
Daniel Boorstin held forth on the mysteries of the Mayan 
civilization. 
</P>
<P>
	After a siesta-inducing lunch, most of the 465 passengers  
forsook the inviting deck chairs and crowded into the lounge to 
hear anthropologist Rebecca Storey of the University of Houston 
discourse on the human skeletons exhumed at the Copan ruins in 
Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day almost the entire passenger list and a goodly  
segment of the cruise staff piled into 11 buses for a 3 1/2-hour ride 
to ruins at Chichen Itza, Mexico. Here the mythic ``feathered 
serpent'' would descend the north face of the great pyramid on the 
day of the vernal equinox, as thousands of enraptured Mexicans 
cheered and beat tin-pan gongs. 
</P>
<P>
	One best comprehends the impact of 11 tourist buses in a row by  
viewing the line outside the women's room at the first pit stop. 
Yet in the name of culture, there were few to complain. 
</P>
<P>
	Going to sea to get learned rather than sunburned is one of the  
fastest-growing segments of the cruise industry. Travelers no 
longer just transit the Panama Canal. They absorb its history and 
details of shipping and lock maintenance from experts like 
historian David McCullough. 
</P>
<P>
	Sailing up the Amazon or off Australia's Great Barrier Reef or  
in the path of St. Paul's journeys across the Mediterranean now 
means more than postcards and boring the dinner guests with slide 
shows. These are opportunities for in-depth exploration and on-site 
learning at graduate level under the guidance of expert lecturers. 
</P>
<P>
	The trend toward cruising as a cultural quest parallels the  
rapid growth of Elderhostel, a nonprofit organization that arranges 
educational voyages for seniors that take in everything from 
Antarctica to Zanzibar. Harvard, Fordham and many other 
universities now have their own alumni travel and study programs, 
using faculty members as guides and lecturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Club Med, former purveyor of ooh-la-la topless sand and sea  
vacations, now enlists poets, authors and editors to provide 
cultural enrichment at some of its sun-kissed villages around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	In 11 days aboard the 18,000-ton Stella Solaris, flagship of  
Royal Olympic line, the seagoing scholars visited other Mayan 
temples, pyramids and sacred wells in Belize, Honduras and 
Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
	Accompanied by vacationing university lecturers, they debarked  
at obscure ports, off the beaten tourist path, where loading 
bananas onto container ships sustained the local economy more than 
duty-free shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	The faculty without exception found their shipboard audiences  
more attentive and better informed than the cream of their college 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Older passengers in particular, 50 and above, have an intense  
hunger to cruise someplace and learn something, instead of just 
eating themselves to death in the dining room,'' said Dr. Anthony 
Aveni, author and professor of astronomy and anthropology at 
Colgate University. 
</P>
<P>
	Eager late-learners kept the faculty on its toes long after  
classes were out. Aveni was out on deck every evening explaining 
the phenomenon of the green flash caused by the sun sinking into 
the sea. And later, sometimes arrayed in the tuxedo that is de 
rigueur on formal nights, he was on the darkened lido deck pointing 
out the constellations to those passing up the midnight buffet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Retired people have not retired their brains. They want more  
out of life than just recreation,'' said planetarium scientist and 
NASA consultant Ted Pedas, who launched the concept of 
astronomy-theme cruises more than two decades ago. Cruise lines at 
first were cautiously reluctant to market enrichment over 
entertainment, but many have since come aboard and seek out 
big-name professors as eagerly as they do top cabaret acts. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to pioneering annual Equinox cruises to the Mayan  
ruins, Pedas in 1993 organized a Mediterranean voyage to view the 
Perseid meteor shower. He now serves as project coordinator for 
Royal Olympic ships, which fly the Greek flag. 
</P>
<P>
	Come August, like a fleet admiral, Pedas will dispatch five  
ships into the Black Sea to witness the last complete solar eclipse 
of this millennium. Astronaut Scott Carpenter heads his lecture 
team. Dozens of competing cruise ships will be deployed along a 
70-mile wide band stretching from Land's End, England, to southeast 
Turkey to catch the Aug. ll solar eclipse. 
</P>
<P>
	Why would so many travel so far to chase two minutes and five  
seconds of total daytime darkness? 
</P>
<P>
	``An eclipse is much more than a learning experience. It's a  
celestial event that Europeans have been waiting four decades for. 
Not since 1961 has the shadow of the moon touched their continent. 
In North America this will not occur again until the year 2017,'' 
said Pedas, who has been fascinated by solar eclipses since first 
seeing darkness at noon when he was 12 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ships at sea are the best observation platforms for a solar  
eclipse,'' he enthused. ``They have access to immediate weather 
information, can maneuver into the best viewing position and enjoy 
360 degrees of visibility, from horizon to horizon, unimpeded by 
dust or light pollution from land. Camera nuts will have a filming 
frenzy, and everyone will want to drink up knowledge, then some of 
the captain's champagne, when the sun shines again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With water, water everywhere but few on deck to care, the thirst  
for knowledge among our shipmates approached the cravings of 
Coleridge's parched ``Ancient Mariner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five times as many passengers flocked to Dr. Boorstin's closing  
lecture as attended the final jackpot session of ``Snowball 
Bingo.'' The shuffleboard tournament had to be canceled for lack of 
interest -- actually, because of greater interest in learning the 
Mayan alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the Romanian magician who could cough up a dozen pingpong  
balls was spotted between floor shows reading up on magic and blood 
sacrifices among the tribes of the Yucatan.

<HEADLINE> Duval-Woods Rivalry Short Some Wins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- David Duval vs. Tiger Woods has all the  
makings of a great golf rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval is the top-ranked player in the world, an icy, methodical  
man who hides his emotions behind a pair of wraparound sunglasses. 
Woods is the No. 2 player in the world, a fiery, fist-pumping icon 
who pushed the game from the country clubs to the inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, they summon images of those who became inextricably  
linked through the brilliance of their games and the harmony of 
their personalities -- Nicklaus-Palmer, Nelson-Snead-Hogan, 
Sarazen-Hagen, Nicklaus-Watson. 
</P>
<P>
	But it might be a little premature to add Duval-Woods to that  
list. After all, they've never gone head-to-head on a Sunday 
afternoon at Augusta National with a green jacket on the line. For 
that matter, Duval has yet to win a major championship of any kind, 
though his record suggests it's only a matter of time. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're arguably the two best players in the game today. I  
don't think there's any question about that,'' Jack Nicklaus said 
Tuesday after a practice round at Pinehurst No. 2, site of this 
week's U.S. Open. ``But I think they both feel like they're not 
playing against each other. They're trying to figure out a way to 
win a major championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods captured his first major title at the 1997 Masters --  
winning by a record 12 strokes -- and ascended to the top of the 
world standings for a 41-week run. But he has yet to win another of 
the Big Four events. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval replaced Woods at the top of the rankings with a  
remarkable run of 11 victories in less than two years, including 
the Tour Championship and The Players Championship. But his best 
showing in a major was tying for second in the '98 Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Tiger is a player, one of several players out here,  
that will always be motivating to other competitors, solely because 
you known you're going to have to improve and get better,'' Duval 
said. ``At the same time, I'm a firm believer that if you need 
motivation from outside sources, you're not going to go very far. 
You have to have inner motivation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval doesn't think his steely approach would change, even if  
he's paired with Woods in the final group on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would speculate that I would be thinking this ... is just  
another person that I have to beat,'' Duval said. ``Now, if that 
comes to pass and I come out of top, I might gloat a little more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the only pairing of Woods and Duval is the ``Showdown at  
Sherwood,'' a made-for-TV, 18-hole exhibition that will take part 
in prime time on Aug. 2 in Thousand Oaks, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``By talking about that match as a rivalry, I think it's blowing  
it a bit out of proportion,'' Duval said. ``It's a one-day match. 
It's a one-day, 18-hole thing, and that does not make a rivalry. 
What it is is a good way to get golf in prime time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coming off two straight victories capped by a dazzling  
short-game show on the final day of the Memorial, Woods is one of 
the favorites at Pinehurst. The course sets up perfectly for his 
game and he seems filled with a quiet confidence as he tries to win 
his second major. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've learned from my own mistakes,'' Woods said before a  
practice round. ``Most important of all is I'm not afraid to go out 
on the golf course and apply what I've learned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval has learned that it's not good to pick up a hot coffee pot  
with a bare hand. He suffered second-degree burns on his right 
thumb and forefinger after the accident at his new home last week, 
forcing him to compete at the Open with bandages on both fingers. 
</P>
<P>
	Heeding a doctor's advice, Duval punctured the wounds with a  
knife after finding it difficult to grip his clubs while chipping 
and putting Monday. He returned to the course Tuesday for an 
18-hole practice round and reported no problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't exactly the greatest of timing, but it looks like  
it's going to be OK,'' Duval said.

	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Jeff Cunningham scored in regulation and  
in the shootout round as the Columbus Crew defeated the New England 
Revolution 2-1 in a Major League Soccer game Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian McBride scored a game-clinching shootout goal after  
Cunningham again tied the game. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dow Jumps 100 in Opening Minutes / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 100  
points in the opening minutes of trading today. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancers on the New York Stock Exchange hold a nearly 3-1 lead  
over decliners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is up 53 points and the S&AMP;P 500 Index  
is up ten points. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street is breathing a huge sigh of relief, after a month's  
worth of worries about interest rates and inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	A big increase in April's consumer prices put the markets in  
panic mode, and led many economists to believe the Fed would soon 
raise rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that May's report shows inflation to be benign, many  
Fed-watchers still expect to see higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
	But they say the May CPI takes the pressure off the Fed to make  
a series of rate moves. 
</P>
<P>
	The big bounce in stock prices follows a positive reaction to  
the inflation report in the Treasury market. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds remain solidly higher.

<HEADLINE> Japan's TV Nets To Reduce Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese television broadcasters may stop airing  
shows heavy on sex and violence during evening hours when children 
are likely to be watching. 
</P>
<P>
	The broadcasters are considering a set of guidelines under which  
they would pledge to refrain from airing programs they consider 
inappropriate for children. 
</P>
<P>
	Those are broadly defined as shows containing ``excessive  
violence'' or ``adult language'' between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m., an 
official from Japan's National Association of Commercial 
Broadcasters said Wednesday. He spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines would be the first effort in Japan to designate a  
special viewing time for children. 
</P>
<P>
	Children 12-years-old or younger account for more than 10  
percent of viewers between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m., the group said. 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines would not, however, specify what would make a  
show inappropriate for children. Instead, each TV station would 
decide on its own what shows are acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, prime-time television dramas often contain steamy love  
scenes, and nudity is common on late-night TV. 
</P>
<P>
	A television drama in which a popular actor often wielded a  
knife was blamed for inspiring a spate of juvenile crimes involving 
knives early last year.

<HEADLINE> Woman Guilty of Vehicular Homicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARLBORO, Mass. (AP) -- A 78-year-old woman who smashed her car  
into a house while delivering a meal to a friend -- killing an 
elderly woman inside -- has been convicted of vehicular homicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish it had been me that was dead,'' Margaret Davis told a  
jury during her trial. On Wednesday, she said: ``I was sorry then 
and I'm sorry now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was placed on two years' probation and lost her license for  
10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1998, Davis crashed through the front of a home while  
on her way to visit a friend, killing Antonette Leone, 84. Davis 
said her car slipped on a patch of ice. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of the victim said Davis offered only a slight  
apology, then left. Police said Davis asked if she could finish her 
errand. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was determined to complete her mission -- to leave and  
deliver those meals,'' Natick police Sgt. Paul Thompson said. ``I 
thought she might drive away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police ruled out mechanical defects or icy weather conditions as  
a cause. Investigators said Davis was driving too fast, and a 
witness testified she had run him off the road moments before the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks after the crash, Leone's husband died of a stroke.  
</P>
<P>
	``We feel he died of a broken heart,'' Richard Leone said of his  
father.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lobbies for Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House today accused House  
Republicans of trying to stymie gun restrictions while cutting 
money for new police officers, saying they are ``making the case 
for less cops and more guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, traveling in Europe, also tried to shore up  
support for gun-control legislation among wavering Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called two Democrats, Reps. Nicholas Lampson of Texas  
and Bob Etheridge of North Carolina, from Air Force One en route to 
Geneva, where he addressed the International Labor Organization, 
said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. He said Clinton planned to 
call other Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president fully recognizes the political nature of this  
kind of vote,'' the spokesman said. ``He believes that these are 
sensible measures that the public demands, but he also remembers 
quite clearly'' that Democrats have ``suffered'' because of past 
gun votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think the president believes that the country has  
shifted on these issues and it's important that people stand up,'' 
the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said the ``very pervasive influence'' of the National  
Rifle Association over the past few weeks has watered down 
Senate-passed restrictions and opened new loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
	In calls to lawmakers, Clinton will tell them ``the public is  
expecting them to do the people's business and not the NRA's,'' 
Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also took aim at Republican leaders for seeking to cut  
funding for Clinton's program to allow local communities to hire 
more officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a situation where the Republican leadership is making  
the case for less cops and more guns and the Democratic leadership 
is making the case for more cops and less guns,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's a powerful message that needs to be articulated  
as we move toward the vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's effort to hold Democrats in line tracks attempts by  
the House's top Democrat, Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, to 
persuade two senior Democrats not to join Republicans in sponsoring 
an NRA-backed gun proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA's chief lobbyist believes 40 to 50 Democrats may support  
the proposal backed by one of the senior Democrats, Rep. John 
Dingell of Michigan, and 15 to 20 Republicans may support a White 
House-backed version that cleared the Senate, with more undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	Dingell's proposal contains a provision on gun show background  
checks that is less restrictive than the Senate-passed measure. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democratic leaders have seized on the issue in the wake of  
the Colorado school shootings in April, believing it can help the 
party win control of the House in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Oil Giants Unite in Offshore Gamble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- In a $7.5 million gamble, five  
petroleum giants joined forces to search for oil in an unexplored 
offshore tract 125 miles from the mouth of the Amazon River. 
</P>
<P>
	British Petroleum, Exxon's Brazilian subsidiary Esso, Shell,  
Petrobras and British Borneo on Wednesday snapped up the rights to 
explore an area of 8,730 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole area is unproven for oil. But we see exciting  
possibilities there,'' said Steven Edrich, director of the 
Houston-based British-Borneo International. ``The group has the 
technology and the experience to succeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group was the sole bidder for the area on the second and  
last day of Brazil's historic auction of 27 potentially oil-rich 
areas. The bidding marked the end of a 46-year monopoly over the 
Brazilian oil industry by federal petroleum company Petrobras. 
</P>
<P>
	Unocal also was a winner, leading a consortium that included  
Texaco and Argentina's YPF. For $18.14 million, the group claimed a 
block off the coast of Espirito Santo state, just north of Rio de 
Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the closest fight of the auction, with Unocal's group  
just edging out a consortium led by Mobil, Exxon, Shell and 
Petrobras. 
</P>
<P>
	``The place is excellent,'' said Sergio Brandao, Unocal's  
spokesman. ``It is largely under-explored and we believe it holds 
big oil deposits and natural gas. We may be talking of trillions of 
cubic feet of natural gas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group, he said, would invest up to $10 billion over the next  
ten years if the search proves successful. 
</P>
<P>
	In association with the YPF, Italy's ENI, whose aggressive  
bidding showed its appetite for the Brazilian market, paid $29.14 
million to beat out three competitors for the rights to a block in 
the Santos basin. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, ENI picked up another block in the same area with an  
offer of $76.6 million, far above other bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our interest is obvious: Brazil is Latin America's biggest  
market. I have no doubts we will find oil,'' said Rocco 
Valentinetti, president of ENI's oil division Agip do Brasil. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the auction, Texaco and a consortium led by Amerada  
Hess won rights over two separate areas, while YPF with various 
partners picked up the rights to four sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is big operation, but we are ready for it,'' said Mateo  
Turic, YPF upstream manager. ``The prize is big and we are after 
it.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves 3-Day Diabetes Monitor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Diabetics are about to get the first  
technology that measures their glucose levels continually for up to 
three days, an advance that could dramatically improve treatment 
for some patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The new test, approved by the government Wednesday, marks an  
important step toward creating permanent, painless glucose monitors 
-- but it won't yet replace those finger-prick blood tests diabetics 
hate. 
</P>
<P>
	MiniMed Inc.'s ``continuous glucose monitoring system'' instead  
is for doctors to use occasionally to customize patients' diabetes 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	A doctor would slip a small sensor just under the skin of the  
abdomen for up to three days. The sensor measures glucose levels 
every 10 seconds and records the average every five minutes, 
storing the readings in a pager-size monitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you take just a couple of blood sugars a day, it can look  
like the patient's in good control'' when really he or she has 
dangerous glucose spikes, explained Dr. Kimber Richter of the Food 
and Drug Administration. ``This gives a doctor a better sense of 
what's going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the FDA's approval Wednesday, it is unclear just how  
quickly doctors can begin using the much-anticipated monitor. 
MiniMed said it plans to begin sales in certain areas next month. 
But the company refused to say how much testing will cost patients, 
how much the required computer system will cost doctors or where 
the device will first be available. 
</P>
<P>
	Diabetes afflicts 16 million Americans whose bodies cannot  
properly regulate glucose, also known as blood sugar. Many rely on 
insulin shots, while others require different medications and 
special diets. 
</P>
<P>
	Maintaining tight control of glucose is vital for preventing  
blindness, heart disease and other complications of diabetes. So 
diabetics must prick their fingers several times a day to test 
their blood glucose levels. 
</P>
<P>
	But that testing gives just a snapshot of how well diabetics are  
doing. There's no way to measure glucose fluctuations while the 
patient sleeps at night, and a patient who tests his blood at noon 
each day has no way to know if glucose sharply spikes two hours 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Knowing day-long glucose patterns might lead a doctor to adjust  
a patient's treatment or testing schedule for tighter control. 
</P>
<P>
	MiniMed's system is the first technology that can show such  
patterns. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients must continue doing regular finger-stick blood tests  
during the MiniMed test, Richter stressed. The monitor merely 
records glucose readings -- it does not show results to the patient. 
</P>
<P>
	When the monitoring is done, the doctor downloads the records  
into a computer that will analyze daily glucose fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
	The readings are different from those diabetics are used to  
because the sensor isn't implanted deep enough to measure blood, 
just glucose levels in tissue. MiniMed will have to train doctors 
to deal with the difference, the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA praised the device as a first step toward creating a  
permanent, painless glucose monitor that one day would free 
diabetics from needing blood tests. 
</P>
<P>
	MiniMed is developing a long-term implantable sensor. It hopes  
eventually to pair the monitor with an implantable insulin pump 
that would automatically trigger insulin therapy whenever needed, 
working like an artificial pancreas. 
</P>
<P>
	Competitor Cygnus Inc. is trying a non-implantable method,  
testing a wristwatch that sends tiny electric currents into the 
skin to measure glucose ions. And other companies are trying to 
measure glucose with infrared light.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola, Hellenic Discuss Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Coca-Cola Beverages PLC said Wednesday that it is  
talking with Hellenic Bottling Company SA about a possible merger 
worth $6.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	If it goes through, the deal would create the dominant drinks  
bottler for the Coca-Cola Co. in eastern and central Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Greece's Hellenic Bottling would hold a majority stake of around  
56 percent in the enlarged group, but Coca-Cola Beverage chief 
executive Neville Isdell would become chief executive of the merged 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca Cola Beverages PLC acknowledged the merger was being  
discussed, but neither company would comment further. It also 
cautioned that an agreement may not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the proposed merger makes strategic sense, would  
fill a management vacuum at the Hellenic operation and is likely to 
please the world's top soft-drink retailer, Coca-Cola Co., which 
holds a majority stake in Coca-Cola Beverages. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged group would be the second-largest bottler for the  
Coca-Cola system in the world with operations spanning 22 
countries, primarily in central and eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	While there is little geographical overlap between the two  
bottlers, analysts say considerable synergy benefits could likely 
be gained from combining bottling plants and distribution networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Beverages has operations in 13 European countries,  
including Ukraine, Belarus and Hungary, while Hellenic operates in 
nine countries, including Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The only countries in which both companies operate is Romania.  
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the move would also fill a management vacuum at  
Hellenic Bottling, which hasn't had a chief executive for about 18 
months.

<HEADLINE> Cyclists Banned From Tour de France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- When the Tour de France begins next month, several  
of the world's top cyclists -- a popular French rider included -- 
won't be competing after they were banned in the wake of a doping 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, race organizers barred Frenchman Richard Virenque,  
Laurent Roux and Philippe Gaumont, as well as the entire TVM team, 
from taking part in the event that begins on July 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, defending Tour champion Marco Pantani said earlier he  
won't compete after he was expelled from the Tour of Italy on 
suspicion of taking banned substances. 
</P>
<P>
	Virenque, who rides for the Italian Polti team, is ``not  
welcome'' because ``his presence would be incompatible with the 
image of the Tour, and the one we want to preserve,'' said 
Jean-Marie Leblanc, director of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Roux rides for the Casino team, while Gaumont rides for Cofidis.  
</P>
<P>
	French authorities have placed Virenque, Roux and Gaumont under  
formal investigation, a step away from being formally charged, in 
the aftermath of last year's Festina doping scandal that hangs over 
the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Other cyclists from Casino, Cofidis and Polti are free to enter  
the race, but TVM is banned. 
</P>
<P>
	``The behavior of TVM constitutes an offense to the Tour,''  
Leblanc said. ``Its image is incompatible with the event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TVM's sporting director Cees Priem is under investigation for  
drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanish team ONCE is free to enter, but without its director,  
Manolo Saiz, and doctor, Nicolas Terrados. ONCE's Laurent Jalabert, 
ranked No. 1, said he won't compete even though he is eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	While several of Virenque's Festina teammates admitted to drug  
use, Virenque has always denied knowingly taking banned substances. 
</P>
<P>
	``Richard Virenque epitomizes, in his name, in his image, the  
doping phenomenon, whether or not he is responsible for the 
situation,'' Leblanc said. 
</P>
<P>
	Virenque quit the sport last year after his team canceled his  
contract and he was unable to find a new team. 
</P>
<P>
	But in January, the Italian Polti team offered him a two-year  
deal. After signing, Virenque said he was looking forward to 
competing in the Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame because he is no more guilty than other  
cyclists,'' said Vittorio Algeri, sporting director at Polti. ``I 
think he has already paid too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hein Verbruggen, president of cycling's governing body, the UCI,  
said he was worried the ban would lead to further legal battles. 
</P>
<P>
	``My main concern is that in the coming two or three weeks, we  
are going to talk about doping, about legal procedures, about 
everything except the sport,'' Verbruggen said.

<HEADLINE> Virtual Life: Tarzan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Me Tarzan. You game?  
</P>
<P>
	The question is appropriate as two new PC games arrive based on  
the Disney summer animated feature ``Tarzan,'' featuring the 
legendary ape man and his beloved Jane. 
</P>
<P>
	Swinging from the big screen to the computer screen, Tarzan goes  
from two dimensions to three in the noble savage's bid to become 
king of the nation's software aisle jungles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Disney's Tarzan Action Game'' (Disney Interactive, CD-ROM for  
Windows, $29.99) puts a rousing new spin on traditional 
side-scrolling arcade-style games, adding fresh player perspectives 
in a realistic 3-D rain forest environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Examples include players trying to outrun an elephant stampede  
in action seen from a rolling, head-on camera angle. Looking over 
Tarzan's shoulder, they have to fight off slithering pythons. Seen 
from various angles, they hitch a ride on a stork. 
</P>
<P>
	There is swimming, running, jumping, tree climbing and combat  
with a crude spear. Naturally, players must also swing through the 
trees on vines. And adding a new mode of locomotion to treetop 
travel, the new Tarzan has mastered tree-surfing, sliding barefoot 
over mossy, serpentine branches high in the jungle canopy. 
</P>
<P>
	The game, like the movie, showcase a new-look Tarzan, a  
realistic animated version of the ape man that's a far cry from the 
usual Disney cartoons. Besides his appearance, Tarzan's movements 
have a heightened sense of ape-like realism, giving the game an 
edgy, modern feel. 
</P>
<P>
	To make the game appeal to all ages and genders, along with  
primate and pachyderm species, gamers can assume various roles: 
Little Tarzan, grown-up Tarzan, Jane, ape buddy Terk or Tantor the 
elephant. 
</P>
<P>
	Linking the game action to the movie are 21 full-motion video  
clips, some played as rewarding interludes following the completion 
of 14 regular levels. There are also 13 bonus levels for 
accomplished players. 
</P>
<P>
	The action game is a nonstop, adrenaline-pumped roller-coaster  
ride designed for adults and children 8 years old and up. For 
younger children, ages 4-8, there's ``Disney's Activity Center, 
Tarzan'' (also $29.99). 
</P>
<P>
	It's packed with less frantic computer game play, incorporating  
educational components like the ``Jungle Journal,'' a story-making 
application that comes with a secret code and online functions so 
kids can choose to share or keep their writings to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Journal entries can be dressed up with background scenes from  
the movie they color themselves and pictures, so kids can 
personalize their storytelling and print it. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Trash the Camp'' musical game is surefire fun, mixing  
learning with play as kids click on Terk and other apes to compose 
music in a campsite cluttered with gear. Different items make 
different sounds and can be set to play in a wide variety of 
combinations. 
</P>
<P>
	There are pots and pans to bang with kitchen utensils, brooms,  
barrels and other luggage to pound on, a croquet mallet and ball 
for additional percussion and a host of other neat-sounding stuff. 
Rounding it out, Terk will smash plates on her head to simulate a 
cymbal crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The program records the compositions children come up with and  
can print them out on song sheets, accompanied by lyrics kids make 
to go with tunes. There's also a karaoke function so children can 
sing along to melodies inspired by the movie soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
	Other educational components include printable animal fact  
cards, a memory matching game similar to Concentration, a game 
teaching children what different animals eat, and an arcade 
strategy game that builds problem-solving skills and hand-eye 
coordination. 
</P>
<P>
	A third title, ``Disney's Print Studio, Tarzan'' ($19.99), isn't  
a game but will still thrill kids who love to make things on the 
computer and print them. Calendars, greeting cards, stickers, party 
invitations, posters and birthday party favors -- all based on 
``Tarzan'' characters, scenery and artwork -- are just some of the 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	On top of everything, Disney is offering a prepaid children's  
ticket to the ``Tarzan'' movie with the purchase of any software 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a deal that will make Tarzan fans beat their chests and let  
out their loudest jungle yells.

<HEADLINE> Heart Drug Helps Defibrillators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A heart drug that had fallen out of favor actually helps  
defibrillators work better in people with faulty heart rhythms, 
researchers reported today in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	One study found that people with implanted defibrillators  
reduced their risk of death and unnecessary electric shocks from 
the implants by 48 percent if they also took the drug sotalol. 
</P>
<P>
	A second study found that pre-treatment with the drug ibutilide  
greatly improved the chances that people with atrial fibrillation 
would resume a normal heart rhythm after being shocked with an 
external defibrillator. 
</P>
<P>
	About 350,000 sudden cardiac deaths occur in the United States  
every year. Most are thought to be caused by two types of heart 
rhythm disturbances: ventricular fibrillation or ventricular 
tachycardia. 
</P>
<P>
	Fibrillation occurs when heart muscle fibers twitch randomly.  
Tachycardia is an extremely rapid heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Implanted defibrillators are cassette tape-sized devices that  
shock the heart back into a normal rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotalol and ibutilide are Class III anti-arrhythmia drugs.  
Sotalol fell into disfavor after a study two years ago found that 
implanted defibrillators save many more lives. 
</P>
<P>
	But the latest study on sotalol, paid for by the drug's maker,  
Berlex Laboratories, found that it complements the defibrillators. 
The study involved 302 patients and was led by Dr. Antonio Pacifico 
of the Texas Arrhythmia Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	The other study, of ibutilide, looked at 100 patients. It was  
led by Dr. Hakan Oral at the University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	In an editorial, Dr. Philip Podrid of Boston University said  
that because of concerns about harmful side effects, use of the 
drugs should be confined to patients for whom other treatments are 
inadequate.

<HEADLINE> S.C. Invests in Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- After 104 years on the sidelines, South  
Carolina is investing some of its pension fund in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock market investments of state money were forbidden after  
South Carolina lost money in canal and rail project stocks in 1895. 
The state constitution was amended in 1996 to allow South Carolina 
back into the market. 
</P>
<P>
	During the intervening years, the state invested in bonds  
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina and West Virginia were the last two states to  
allow investments in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	The state invested $79 million Wednesday, Treasurer Grady  
Patterson said. South Carolina plans to invest $917 million in the 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index by the end of the month. Next year, 
that is expected to reach about $1.8 billion, 10 percent of the 
retirement system portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson said the state will continue to take a conservative  
approach.

<P>
	CARTHAGE, Tenn. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore formally began his  
drive for the presidency today, promising moral leadership and 
making ``the crisis in the American family'' the centerpiece of his 
campaign. ``With your help, I will take my own values of faith and 
family to the presidency -- to build an America that is not only 
better off, but better,'' he told a hometown crowd of thousands on 
Main Street. Gore promised action to curb gun violence, a campaign 
against ``a culture of violence and mayhem'' in entertainment, and 
more after-school programs. He promised not to privatize Social 
Security and to make treating mental illness a higher priority.

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP-- The Yugoslav withdrawal from the zone  
extending from Pristina to Kosovo's southern border was largely 
completed by its midnight deadline last night, except for isolated 
cases of broken-down vehicles, a NATO spokesman, Maj. Lewis 
Garneau, said today. Under the peace agreement, all 40,000 Serb 
forces are to be out of Kosovo by Sunday night; NATO said today 
26,000 have left. Meanwhile, ethnic Albanian refugees were pouring 
back into Kosovo at the crossing on the Albanian border, creating

the Yellow Sea, after a high-seas shootout sank one North Korean 
gunboat, damaged five others and may have killed 30 sailors. Five 
North Korean warships stopped just outside the boundary today and 
did not try to move into the disputed waters, the South Korean 
Defense Ministry said. Entry into the contested zone by North 
Korean ships provoked yesterday's brief battle. North Korea, 
describing the situation as grave, released a statement today that 
suspended visits by South Koreans to the capital, Pyongyang, but 
not to other parts of the country.

	FBI Arrests Longtime Fugitive Soliah

	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Kathleen Ann Soliah, a longtime fugitive and  
Symbionese Liberation Army member sought for 25 years, was arrested 
today in St. Paul, Minn., the FBI announced. Soliah, also known as 
Sara Jane Olson, 52, was arrested without incident, the FBI said. 
Soliah was indicted Feb. 26, 1976, by a grand jury in Los Angeles 
on felony charges including conspiracy to commit murder of police 
officers, and possession of explosives. An FBI statement said 
Soliah had surfaced as a pivotal suspect in the investigation of 
the SLA, a Berkeley, Calif.-based terrorist group that kidnapped 
newspaper heiress Patty Hearst in 1974.

House Appropriations Committee, had virtually no investments, 
though they had a large say in how billions of dollars of 
taxpayers' money was spent. The top House Democrat, Minority Leader

<HEADLINE> FBI Arrests Longtime Fugitive Soliah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- A fugitive member of the Symbionese  
Liberation Army, the radical group that kidnapped Patricia Hearst 
25 years ago, was captured today in St. Paul, where she had made a 
new life as a stage actress under one of the most common of 
Minnesota names: Olson. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen Ann Soliah, 52, had been wanted in Los Angeles since  
1976, when she was indicted on murder conspiracy and explosives 
charges for allegedly placing pipe bombs under two police cars. 
They did not go off. The FBI said she also committed bombings and 
bank robberies with the SLA. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Wednesday, she had been living as Sara Jane Olson in an  
ivy-covered house with her doctor husband and three daughters, the 
FBI said. Ms. Olson had gotten good reviews for her starring 
performances in local theater productions, appearing in such plays 
as ``Lion in Winter'' and ``King Lear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agents found her after receiving tips from viewers of  
``America's Most Wanted,'' which featured Ms. Soliah in a broadcast 
last month. The FBI had also offered a $20,000 reward for Ms. 
Soliah last month, on the 25th anniversary of a shootout in Los 
Angeles that left six SLA members dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Soliah did not participate in the shootout or the Hearst  
kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	In a federal warrant drawn up this year, authorities said that  
in 1984, her husband was aware of her true name and fugitive 
status. It was unclear whether she was married at the time to her 
current husband, Fred Peterson. They bought their house in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	No one who went into the house or answered the door Wednesday  
would comment. Ms. Soliah was scheduled to be arraigned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said Ms. Soliah had taken the last name of Olson, which  
is extremely common in Minnesota because of the large number of 
people of Scandinavian descent. Neighbors described her as a 
well-spoken and friendly woman, and an avid jogger and gardener. 
</P>
<P>
	``She seemed very classy,'' said Gary Price, the neighborhood's  
regular mailman since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Kramer, who lives across the street, said she was a ``very  
down-to-Earth person'' who would bring a casserole to block 
parties, ``just like the rest of us did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Soliah was arrested about 8:30 a.m. while driving to a  
school to give some kind of lesson, Los Angeles Police Detective 
Tom King said. Detectives described her as being somewhat surprised 
and relieved at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a pretty good fingerprint identification that she's  
the person we're looking for,'' said James H. Burrus Jr., the agent 
in charge of the Minneapolis FBI office. 
</P>
<P>
	Her capture closed a chapter in one of the most sensational news  
stories of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLA, a band of leftist radicals with a seven-headed snake as  
their symbol, kidnapped Ms. Hearst from her Berkeley, Calif., 
apartment in February 1974. She was 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The group demanded that the newspaper heiress' parents, Randolph  
and Catherine Hearst, distribute $2 million worth of food to the 
needy before it would discuss freedom for their daughter. The 
demand later climbed to $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But then Ms. Hearst metamorphosed into Tania, a member of the  
very group that took her prisoner. Two months after the kidnapping, 
she was photographed carrying a carbine during an SLA holdup of a 
San Francisco bank -- the robbery for which she eventually was 
tried, convicted and sent to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	In May 1974, as people watched on live TV, Los Angeles police  
trapped heavily armed SLA members in a house and riddled it with 
bullets. The group's leader, an ex-convict who called himself 
Cinque, and five other SLA members died. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hearst went underground and didn't re-emerge until 1975,  
when she was arrested in San Francisco. Although she claimed she 
was the victim of brainwashing, she was convicted and sentenced to 
seven years for the bank robbery. She served two years before 
President Carter commuted her sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, she is a married mother living in Connecticut, and a  
sometime actress and author. No one answered the door at her home 
Wednesday, and she did not return calls for comment from The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is all so old,'' she told WCBS-AM. ``I don't want to be  
drawn into all of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King, the Los Angeles detective, said Ms. Soliah left the United  
States at some point and lived in Africa for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	A warrant drawn up in March said that in 1984, her parents told  
the FBI that she was living outside California, had a new identity, 
and was married with two children to a man who knew her true name 
and fugitive status. 
</P>
<P>
	The warrant, which charged Ms. Soliah with unlawful flight to  
avoid prosecution, also said that in 1989, she attempted to 
negotiate a surrender through her lawyer. The negotiations failed 
because she requested complete immunity. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one other former SLA member is still at large: James  
Kilgore, Ms. Soliah's boyfriend in her SLA days. He was profiled on 
the same ``America's Most Wanted'' show as Ms. Soliah, but FBI 
spokeswoman Coleen Rowley said Wednesday she wasn't aware of any 
leads on Kilgore.

<HEADLINE> Profile of Spurs' Tim Duncan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) -- If Hurricane Hugo  
hadn't hit, Tim Duncan probably would be dreaming of Olympic gold 
as a swimmer, and the San Antonio Spurs might be just another team 
that's never made it to the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	But the hurricane that ravaged his native St. Croix in 1989  
destroyed the only Olympic-sized pool. So the tallest teen-ager on 
the island turned to football, then basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, he was so clumsy he was the butt of jokes.  
</P>
<P>
	``He never got angry, he'd just play harder,'' recalled former  
classmate Carl Hennemann, now an army lieutenant in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	His height also drew his classmates' levity. One year, he grew 4  
inches, said Donald Bough, who coached a rival team. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan, coach Cuthbert George said, couldn't even dunk the ball.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was shy, very shy,'' George said. ``I thought he wasn't  
aggressive enough to compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he was a quick study, starting as a quarterback, and showed  
remarkable stamina that is attributed to his swimming background. 
He was a top U.S. competitor for his age group in the 400-meter 
freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	Former coach Neville James noted that he always was ``the  
perfect player, a team player. He didn't demand that he score all 
the time. He didn't have any ego.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan soon sharpened his skills, and the gawky youth showed  
promise of the graceful jump hooks and slam dunks to come. 
</P>
<P>
	He carried The Demons of St. Dunstan's Episcopal High School to  
an undefeated season in 1992. The year before, The Demons had an 
0-12 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't even have a rim,'' George said, pointing to where  
he welded the basket on the outdoor court surrounded by grass. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Dunstan's closed after Duncan graduated, but Abraham Perez  
still cares for the building and was happy to unlock the door of an 
abandoned computer laboratory to show off a newspaper photograph 
that he posted of Duncan playing in a high school tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	He was an honor student, so bright he skipped third grade and  
graduated among the top five students, former headmistress 
Catherine Milligan-Terrell said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also was something of a clown, joining classmates to run  
through the abandoned Salt River Hotel evading paint ball shots 
and, at least twice, playing truant for a day of bodysurfing at the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-footer was offered scholarships to Georgetown, Delaware  
and Providence. But he chose Wake Forest in North Carolina to study 
for a degree in psychology, perhaps because his sister lives in 
Winston-Salem. 
</P>
<P>
	After his sophomore and junior years, he turned down chances to  
enter the NBA draft to fulfill a promise to his mother that he 
would earn a degree. She died of cancer the day before the 
23-year-old basketball star's 14th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	``When his mother died, he was sad. When I watch him on TV, I  
can see (it),'' said high school friend Rabiah Green, the daughter 
Donna Christian-Christensen, the territory's U.S. congresswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	The year after he earned his degree, the forward for the San  
Antonio Spurs was voted Rookie of the Year and an All-NBA 
first-team player, an honor he earned for the second time in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew of him always as a quiet fire, a quiet giant. His  
laid-back attitude is the embodiment of people of St. Croix, doing 
things without fanfare and hoopla,'' said Senate President Vargrave 
Richards, whose daughter attended St. Dunstan's. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an ideal role model for the youngsters,'' said Maria  
Heywood of the St. Croix federation of teachers. ``He's humble and 
has a lot of principle. You can see he came from a traditional 
Virgin Islands upbringing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan's fame has put St. Croix on the map, and islanders are  
returning the favor. 
</P>
<P>
	While St. Croix airport is being renovated, fans have erected a  
massive billboard photograph of the island's favorite son in the 
parking lot announcing: ``Welcome to St. Croix -- Home of Tim 
Duncan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cash-strapped government hopes to make money from him and is  
discussing giving a 100 percent tax break to his T.D. Enterprises, 
which plans several ventures, including a sports bar in St. Croix. 
</P>
<P>
	A new high school gym has been named after him, with every wall  
plastered with pictures of the school's barracuda mascot decked out 
in No. 21 gear. 
</P>
<P>
	A mural of his face headlined ``Our Rookie of the Year'' graces  
the front wall of Harvey's Restaurant, and inside there's a photo 
gallery. Harvey's has erected a huge TV screen for fans wanting to 
see Duncan lead the Spurs in the Alamodome in San Antonio for the 
start of the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday afternoon, some 150 islanders boarded a charter jet  
bound for the finals. Seeing them off was Pamela Richards, the 
acting commissioner of tourism, who said Duncan's fame had promoted 
the Virgin Islands more than any advertising the government could 
dream of buying. 
</P>
<P>
	``Timmy has placed St. Croix on the map and we are eternally  
grateful for that,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Pushing Steel, Oil, Gas Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Struggling U.S. steel, oil and natural gas  
companies may soon get some relief through $1.5 billion in 
taxpayer-backed emergency loans under Senate consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate vote could come as early as today, a day after  
legislation creating the loan programs cleared a key procedural 
hurdle. The Senate voted 70-29 on Tuesday to limit debate on the 
bill. That is 10 more votes than the 60 needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong support on the procedural matter signaled that the  
bill's supporters would prevail. Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said 
the future of the U.S. steel industry was at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are we going to ship another U.S. industry, the steel  
industry, overseas?'' he asked colleagues. ``Are we going to allow 
foreign entities to make ghost towns of our steel-dependent 
communities?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A similar program for small oil and gas firms was added earlier  
as part of a compromise with Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide $1 billion in loans to domestic steel  
producers injured by low-priced imports and $500 million for U.S. 
oil and natural gas industries hurt by sagging prices. The taxpayer 
cost for the new loan programs is put at $270 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative senators who opposed the bill argued that the extra  
spending would come directly from Social Security surpluses -- money 
that Republicans have pledged repeatedly this year not to touch. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't be for not plundering the Social Security trust fund  
and be for this'' steel and oil bill, said Sen. Phil Gramm, 
R-Texas, an oil-producing state. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before debating the bill, GOP senators lost their latest  
attempt to end Democratic delaying tactics against another measure 
that would make it harder for Congress to spend Social Security 
money for anything other than the pension program. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate previously approved the steel-loan program as part of  
an emergency spending bill to fund Kosovo operations. But 
supporters backed down during negotiations with the House when the 
provision threatened to sink the Kosovo spending package. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of a procedural move, the loan bill is expected to  
bypass the normal House committee process and go directly to the 
full House if the Senate passes it. 
</P>
<P>
	Steel companies that qualify would be able to borrow $25 million  
to $250 million at market interest rates. Independent producers and 
other companies in the U.S. oil and gas service industries could 
borrow up to $10 million each. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say many companies now have problems borrowing money  
from banks because of uncertainties about the industries' future. 
</P>
<P>
	Steel companies would be able to make use of the loans through  
the end of 2001 and would have six years to pay the money back. Oil 
and gas companies would have five years to borrow money.

	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- The American Hockey League's Beast of

<HEADLINE> House Releases Financial Statements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many of the 40 freshman House members got a  
nice raise when they came to town in January, while some sacrificed 
sizable incomes for a seat in Congress. But few experienced 
financial swings as dramatic as Oregon Democrat David Wu. 
</P>
<P>
	Wu, an attorney, reported earned income of only $3,501 on the  
1998 financial disclosure forms that were released for House 
members Wednesday. He has seven investment funds, but each returned 
only up to $200 last year. He says he actually lost money through 
his law practice, although that wasn't reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Wu's explanation? He was too busy running for Congress to make  
any money in 1998. Now, as a member of the House, Wu's 1999 salary 
will be the $136,700 earned by rank-and-file members. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual financial disclosure records show Americans what  
their lawmakers owned and owed, the investments they bought and 
sold, outside earnings, travel paid for by private interests and 
speech honoraria that must be donated to charity. Fifty-four 
representatives asked for extensions prior to the May 15 deadline, 
although many have since filed their forms. 
</P>
<P>
	Floor leaders in the House make $151,800, and the speaker's  
compensation is fixed at $175,400. 
</P>
<P>
	Another newcomer, Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin,  
reported just $1,800 in earned income for ``marketing consulting'' 
last year. But Ryan got money from investments, including rental 
property that produced $15,001 to $50,000 in income. 
</P>
<P>
	More typical in the freshman class was Massachusetts Democrat  
Michael Capuano, who as mayor of Somerville, Mass., made $72,500 
last year, and collected a bit more from two rental properties. 
Still, Capuano's election to Congress almost doubled his earned 
income. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, freshmen such as Republican Johnny Isakson of  
Georgia will see a sharp decline in their incomes, as outside 
earnings are limited to $20,505. Isakson, who replaced former 
Speaker Newt Gingrich from a suburban Atlanta district, made 
$308,775 from his real estate business in 1998 and another $17,550 
in fees for serving on corporate boards. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the wealthiest House newcomers is Rep. Robin Hayes,  
R-N.C., an heir to the Cannon textile fortune and owner of a 
hosiery mill. He reported just $38,796 in earned income last year 
but made much more from three trusts, one of which was valued at up 
to $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most unusual filings was by Rep. Jim Turner, R-Texas.  
He had four investments worth between $250,001 and $500,000 listed 
in a nine-page disclosure form, but he attached nearly 800 pages of 
his wife's investment trades -- which included numerous days with 
multiple transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	A few powerful figures, including Majority Leader Dick Armey of  
Texas and House Appropriations Committee Chairman C.W. ``Bill'' 
Young, R-Fla., had virtually no investments. The top House 
Democrat, Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, listed only 
one investment valued between $1,001 and $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., listed his half interest in the  
``opera house'' building in Plainfield, Ill., which once housed a 
theater and his father's restaurant. It was valued between $100,001 
and $250,000, and produced $15,001 to $50,000 in rental income. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert also valued his 270-acre farm in Shipman, Ill., at  
between $100,001 and $250,000. The farm produced income of $15,001 
to $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The third-ranking Republican, Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas,  
had a momentary appearance of great wealth by initially reporting 
that his wife, Christine, owned Exxon stock valued in excess of $50 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten days later, Delay amended the form: The stock was jointly  
owned and only worth between $50,000 and $100,000. It has now been 
sold. DeLay's assets other than the stock were listed at between 
$66,003 and $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential hopeful Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, who chairs the  
House Budget Committee, has an investment fund worth $250,001 to 
$500,000 and annuities worth $100,002 to $200,000. He accepted free 
trips to a dozen cities, paid for by Doubleday Book Co., to promote 
the book he co-authored: ``Courage is Contagious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who led  
the impeachment investigation of President Clinton, kept $100,001 
to $250,000 in Congress' credit union and had an Individual 
Retirement Account -- valued at $15,001 to $50,000 -- in the White 
House credit union. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means  
Committee with jurisdiction over taxes, included in his more than 
$3 million in assets 400 Microsoft shares valued at $68,000 and 700 
shares of Intel worth $80,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer is among the few lawmakers who went beyond the  
requirement of listing holdings and unearned income in broad 
categories. He precisely stated the actual value of holdings, and 
in that spirit valued his coin collection at $16,326. 
</P>
<P>
	Some other odds and ends:  
</P>
<P>
	--Freshman Rep. Kenneth Lucas, D-Ky., reported earning $575 in  
fees for performing nearly two dozen weddings as the Boone County, 
Ky., executive. Lucas, a financial planner, also reported $288,688 
in earned income last year. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rep. Vic Snyder, D-Ark., a physician, listed $344 in income  
from his family clinic while a fellow doctor, Oklahoma Republican 
Tom Coburn, reported $9,008 for ``injections only'' at his allergy 
clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla., a former football star in the Hall  
of Fame, earned $19,250 in sports-related speeches. He also 
received $4,829 in deferred compensation from a pro football labor 
settlement before his election to Congress, which does not count 
toward the outside-income limit.

the deadly shooting rampage that left 15 dead. 
</P>
<P>
	They are going beyond simple repairs, renovating the school's  
interior with new furniture, green and blue floor tiles, patterned 
carpet, and a fresh coat of paint. 
</P>
<P>
	``We looked at the entire building to determine what we could do  
quickly,'' Jack Swanzy, the director of planning and design for 
Jefferson County School District, said Tuesday. ``At the same time 
we wanted to make an impact, we wanted to do something to make sure 
people did know it had changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine seniors Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris walked into the  
school on April 20, planted bombs and shot 12 students and a 
teacher to death before committing suicide. Twenty-three others 
were hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who visited the site shortly after the massacre said it  
looked like a war zone. The bodies of dead students lay in the 
library, tables were overturned, backpacks were scattered 
throughout the building, hallways were flooded and windows 
shattered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the school's going to look really nice,'' said Meghan  
McKee, 15, who was in the science room during the shooting. ``There 
will be enough changes that it will have a different kind of feel 
to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Architects hope the renovation will make the return to school on  
Aug. 16 easier for Columbine's 1,900 students. 
</P>
<P>
	``The intent of the school district is to put this back as a  
high school,'' said Swanzy, the project's lead architect. ``We 
don't want to make it a shrine to the tragedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Security is being enhanced, with up to 20 video cameras placed  
throughout the building. Workers are also altering the fire alarm, 
which blared for seven hours straight during and after the rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who were in trapped in there for three or four hours  
said that sound would stay with them for the rest of their life,'' 
Swanzy said. ``We want to make sure people don't jump out of their 
skin every time there's a fire drill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everything has been cleaned up except the library, which remains  
a crime scene. Swanzy said initial plans called for extensive 
renovations, but parents said students would be too traumatized to 
study there. Other options are being considered. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents didn't want cosmetic changes,'' said Linda Mauser,  
whose son Daniel died in the shooting. ``They wanted it moved.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Promises To Be 'Compassionate' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- George W. Bush is touting himself as a  
``compassionate conservative,'' something he says too many people 
now believe is a contradiction in terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to a crowd of 1,100 supporters at a fund-raiser Tuesday  
night, the Republican governor of Texas -- considered to be the 
front-runner for his party's presidential nomination -- laid out a 
platform that he says will mix a conservative mind with a 
compassionate spirit. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it is a concept his critics will have a hard time  
grasping, but said it is one the country is yearning for. 
``Compassion is a noble goal that Americans will embrace,'' Bush 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised to cut taxes, but help people learn to save. He said  
he will confront the issue of teen-age pregnancy, but offer 
practical help to women in crisis. He vowed to raise standards in 
school, but enact programs to ensure no children are left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	And evoking his father's famous ``points of light,'' the younger  
Bush promised to call for volunteerism. ``I will rally the armies 
of compassion,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls show the 52-year-old Bush with a wide lead against both  
parties' presidential contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush formally announced his candidacy Saturday, and has been on  
an intense campaign swing through New England since. 
</P>
<P>
	His appearances in Connecticut and earlier Tuesday in  
Massachusetts broke fund- raising records for the Republican party 
in both states. 
</P>
<P>
	A $500-a-plate fund-raiser in Boston netted $800,000 for his  
exploratory committee, which has already raised at least $14 
million, said local Republicans. A reception beforehand brought in 
another $100,000 for the Republican State Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1,000-a-plate fund-raiser at the Hyatt Regency in Greenwich  
brought in about $1.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides have said Bush's goal is to raise about $33 million, with  
the federal government kicking in an additional $12 million or so, 
bringing the grand total to $45 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to leading other candidates in fund-raising, Bush  
has the endorsement of scores of Republican leaders, including Gov. 
John G. Rowland. 
</P>
<P>
	Rowland on Tuesday said Bush's platform harkens back to the  
ideals of his father and President Ronald Reagan in what he called 
``the proud years of America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our country is hungry for leadership,'' Rowland said. ``The  
nation wants to restore dignity to the presidency of the United 
States. ... We have the right candidate to do that job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appearance in Connecticut Tuesday was a sort of homecoming  
for Bush, whose family has strong ties to the state. His father 
grew up in Greenwich, and both men graduated from Yale.

<HEADLINE> Writing the Wayans Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ask a comedian why he wrote a book, and you're  
likely to get an answer like the one Damon Wayans gives: ``I wanted 
to see if I could spell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nah, I just wanted a challenge,'' he quickly adds, showing a  
more serious face. 
</P>
<P>
	He saw other comedians writing books and topping best-seller  
lists and concluded: ``You know what? I think I can do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, ``Bootleg,'' which he said was a jokey way of conceding  
the book would fall prey to bootlegging. Plus, he says, ``It's 
catchy. Bottom line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wayans received two Emmy nominations as a writer of ``In Living  
Color,'' the old Fox sketch comedy show on which he created the 
memorable characters Homey the Clown and one of the (``two snaps 
up!'') Men On Film. He has appeared in the movies ``Beverly Hills 
Cop'' (as the fey Banana Man), ``Bulletproof,'' ``The Last Boy 
Scout,'' ``Mo' Money,'' ``Major Payne'' and ``Blankman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But his first and enduring love is standup comedy, where he's  
used to just blurting things out on-stage. So writing this book 
turned out to be a revelation, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saying it is one thing. But to read it back is another thing.  
You know: `Wow, is that really how I see things?' Because I don't 
hear most of the things I say. ... When I have to read it back, I 
go, `Wow. You're a sick puppy.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In the book, Wayans tackles the cult of personality, mocking  
sports stars Magic Johnson and Mike Tyson and suggesting that 
today's black leaders constitute a pretty bleak bunch compared with 
their predecessors: 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``I must have been asleep the day they elected Al Sharpton the  
black representative. He is the only leader in history to show up 
to a rally wearing a tight red velour sweat suit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Then there's Jesse Jackson. I have just one question for  
him: Why is he at every sporting event that ever takes place? ... 
You never saw Martin Luther King at a Muhammad Ali fight ... '' 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Finally, there's Minister Farrakhan ... His speeches are so  
powerful he can make black people stop celebrating Christmas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wayans doesn't consider the book too harsh or politically  
incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's my sense of humor. I think to try to make it a  
little more palatable takes out what's funny about it,'' Wayans 
says. ``I have great respect for all these men. ... You cannot 
really tell a joke about somebody unless people know them and love 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Wayans, who's been married for 15 years and has  
four children, takes on marriage and family life as well as 
ethnicity in his book, making such points as how it's important to 
appreciate your parents, and how it's a high compliment when people 
like your kids. 
</P>
<P>
	One of 10 children himself, five of whom are in show business,  
Wayans feels children are a direct reflection of their parents, and 
he personally measures success as a husband and father, not by his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a comedian until I retire. I'm a father until I die,'' he  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Having a family also has helped him cope with the peaks and  
valleys of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, in 10 years if I can still be going up and down,  
as opposed to being out, I'm happy. That's what a career is. A 
career is a journey,'' he says. ``I love the challenge of a 
comeback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And let's just say that Wayans is very challenged these days.  
</P>
<P>
	He's still coming to grips with the cancellation of the 1997  
critically acclaimed drama that he created and produced, ``413 Hope 
St.,'' which he feels Fox sabotaged by scheduling it opposite NBC's 
``Seinfeld.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Put it on after `The Simpsons' or something. Just so people  
can get a taste of it. You don't just put it against the No. 1 show 
in America,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, he didn't have his heart in ``Damon,'' the  
short-lived sitcom that followed, in which he starred and produced. 
</P>
<P>
	So now, besides writing the book, he's planning a summer  
stand-up tour and looking forward to the release of the movie 
``Harlem Aria,'' which he produced and in which he also co-stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayans' resilience dates back to his childhood, when he  
underwent several operations to fix a clubfoot. Barefoot and 
wearing a canvas jumpsuit during an interview, he unselfconsciously 
shows the scars on what now looks like a normal foot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spent so much time in the hospital as a kid it was scary,''  
he says, recalling that it kept him from playing sports but also 
developed his sense of humor because he wanted to part of the gang 
somehow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what it's like to be black and looked down upon. AND  
handicapped. ... AND poor. ... There's a lot you have to overcome. 
The only thing that really helps you overcome it is other people. 
You meet some wonderful people who look you in the eyes and say, 
`You're my brother. I don't see this.' Or `I do see it, and it's 
OK.''' 
</P>
<P>
	His adversity also gave him greater empathy and led to his  
creating ``underdog'' characters like Homey the angry clown and 
Handi-Man the handicapped superhero. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess my job is to help you understand,'' Wayans says.  
</P>
<P>
	But don't look for those characters again. To paraphrase Homey:  
Wayans don't play that. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he has great affection for them, he says, ``I feel  
like if I don't challenge myself and do something different, then 
the audience is going to see me as dated.''

<HEADLINE> Jackson Set To Become Lakers Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The hippie is going Hollywood.  
</P>
<P>
	It's the ``Shaq, Kobe &AMP; Glen Show,'' directed by Phil Jackson  
and featuring Jack Nicholson and Dyan Cannon in supporting roles. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, the motorcyle-riding Zen master with a knack for  
conjuring up championships, is bringing his unique coaching style 
to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	He reached an agreement in principle Tuesday to become the  
Lakers' coach and, barring last-minute snags over details in his 
reported $30 million, five-year contract, was to be introduced in 
his new role today. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA's coach of the '90s with the marquee cast of Michael  
Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman, Jackson will try to match 
his boffo success with Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Glen Rice. 
</P>
<P>
	Although expectations will be high, Jackson takes over a team  
that hasn't won a title in 11 years after being the league's 
dominant force in the 1980s with Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 
and Showtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers won five championships in the '80s, but haven't  
reached the NBA Finals since 1991, when they were beaten by Jackson 
and the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	During his nine years in Chicago, Jackson orchestrated the  
diverse talents and egos of his stars into an NBA powerhouse that 
won six titles this decade and became one of the league's best 
teams ever. 
</P>
<P>
	He will face a similar challenge with the Lakers, widely  
regarded as a splintered group of talented underachievers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson seems well-equipped for the job.  
</P>
<P>
	A coach who has gone to bookstores to pick out books for each of  
his players, he was motivator, mediator and basketball maestro all 
in one for the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	He related to the players with, as Jordan refers to it, ``that  
Zen Buddhism stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the bizarre Rodman, who spent a mostly disastrous month and  
half with the Lakers this season, thrived under Jackson in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	When Rodman heard Jackson was taking the Lakers' job, he told  
Fox Sports News, ``I would like to play for Phil Jackson and the 
Lakers. I think he's the only coach in the league that really 
understands me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson or not, any chance of Rodman rejoining the Lakers seems  
remote. 
</P>
<P>
	The 53-year-old Jackson, who took this season off, had a 545-193  
record at Chicago and was 111-41 in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	He has the highest winning percentage of any coach in NBA  
regular-season (.738) and playoff (.730) history, and was coach of 
the year in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson averaged 6.7 points in his 13-year NBA playing career,  
11 of them with the New York Knicks. He missed their 1970 title 
season because of a back injury, but played on their 1973 
championship team. 
</P>
<P>
	He is one of only nine men who have won NBA titles both as a  
player and as a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson worked his way up the coaching ranks, leading the Albany  
Patroons of the CBA for five years. He served as an assistant under 
Doug Collins with the Bulls for two years before Collins was fired 
and he became the head coach on July 10, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who will replace interim coach Kurt Rambis, also was  
coveted by the New Jersey Nets and, to a lesser degree, by the 
Knicks before they made their improbable run to the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers fired Del Harris 12 games into last season and  
promoted Rambis from his job as an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	They were swept in the playoffs for the second year in a row,  
losing in the second round to San Antonio after being beaten by 
Utah in the Western Conference finals last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers' courtship of Jackson was a whirlwind affair. The  
Lakers recently indicated that Rambis would be retained, but team 
owner Jerry Buss instead decided to spend more millions to go after 
the high-profile Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers began talking with Todd Musburger, Jackson's agent,  
last week. Jackson was off fishing in a remote area of Alaska, and 
Lakers executives Jerry West and Mitch Kupchak offered him the job 
in a telephone call Monday, after he returned to Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	He obviously was easy to woo, quickly deciding to take the job.  
</P>
<P>
	Jackson already planned to be in Los Angeles today to campaign  
for presidential candidate Bill Bradley, his former Knicks 
teammate.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo May Help Holbrooke's Chances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo  
should ease Senate confirmation of Balkans troubleshooter Richard 
Holbrooke to be U.N. ambassador, the top Democrat on the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware suggested the peace agreement  
would undercut what he called earlier Republican hopes of 
portraying Holbrooke as ``the architect of the Democratic failure 
in the Balkans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee opens three days of confirmation hearings on  
Holbrooke Thursday. The first session will focus on several ethics 
allegations against the veteran diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Clinton nominated Holbrooke to the high-profile job one  
year ago, ethics investigations by the Justice and State 
Departments delayed the formal submission of the nomination for 
eight months. 
</P>
<P>
	Those inquiries dealt largely with speaking fees Holbrooke  
received while serving as a Balkans envoy and with Holbrooke's 
private-sector contacts with former State Department colleagues. 
Holbrooke paid a $5,000 fine to settle the matter without admitting 
fault. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke, a former assistant secretary of state and U.S.  
ambassador to Germany, was the principal architect of the 1995 
peace agreement for Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently vice president of Credit Suisse First Boston Corp.,  
Holbrooke has intermittently continued in his role as unpaid 
diplomatic troubleshooter for the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the chairman of the Foreign Relations  
Committee, said in a recent statement that Holbrooke would receive 
a fair hearing but that the nomination comes with ``much ethical 
baggage attached to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Helms, Marc Thiessen, said Wednesday that  
committee staff had scrutinized material from the investigations 
conducted by both the Justice Department and the State Department 
inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our only agenda is to get the facts out and to give Mr.  
Holbrooke a chance to answer the issues raised by this 
investigation. His fate is in his own hands,'' said Thiessen. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from being introduced by Sens. John Warner, R-Va., and  
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. -- his sponsors -- Holbrooke will be 
the panel's only witness on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A second hearing regarding the nomination will be held June 22  
on United Nations ``reforms;'' and a final one on June 24 on U.S. 
policy in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration and Helms recently reached agreement  
on legislation to pay back dues to the United Nations in exchange 
for various changes in U.S. participation in the international 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke negotiated last October's failed ceasefire in Kosovo  
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, and he made a 
last-minute visit to Belgrade in March in an unsuccessful effort to 
get Milosevic to accept NATO's terms on a Kosovo peace plan to 
avoid airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic essentially agreed to those same terms last week,  
bringing the 11-week NATO bombing campaign to a close. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will be surprised if the hearings turn out to be  
contentious. I will be surprised if they turn out to be 
prolonged,'' Biden told a group of reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Biden predicted the committee would approve Holbrooke's  
nomination before the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
	As to the ethics allegations, Biden dismissed them as petty.  
``There never was any there there,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Police May Not Have 'Rail Killer' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROUND ROCK, Texas (AP) -- A man arrested on a freight train  
Wednesday wasn't the rail-riding murder suspect as police initially 
believed. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities announced the arrest Wednesday night of a man who  
fit the description of Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, a suspect in six 
slayings that happened near railroad tracks since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, authorities said the man was not Resendez-Ramirez.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have a pretty high confidence that it's not Rafael  
Resendez-Ramirez,'' Department of Public Safety spokesman Mike Cox 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A fingerprint test didn't match, he said. The arrested man has a  
similar snake tattoo but on the wrong arm, said another spokesman, 
Tom Vinger. 
</P>
<P>
	Police stopped the train in this Austin suburb after a 911  
caller said Resendez-Ramirez might be on a freight train in the 
area, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	A drifter from Mexico known to hop freight trains,  
Resendez-Ramirez has been wanted by the FBI in connection with five 
Texas killings and one in Lexington, Ky., since August 1997. All 
the victims were beaten to death near railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, police in the east Texas town of Hughes Springs  
said they also consider Resendez-Ramirez a suspect in the killing 
of an 87-year-old woman eight months ago. The victim was robbed and 
beaten to death in her home near a railroad track.

<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Not many people would pass up a round of  
golf with Jack Nicklaus. Tom Watson did Wednesday as he declared 
his game ready for the 99th U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson, who won the Open in 1982, was scheduled to play a final  
practice round with Nicklaus, but decided to cancel at the last 
minute. That opened up the 49-year-old for some good-natured 
ribbing from Nicklaus, who is 10 years older. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, I'm going to miss you today,'' Watson said to Nicklaus as  
he walked out of the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus shot back: ``Getting tired, huh? That's what happens  
when you get old.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watson said it's not unusual for him to skip a practice round  
before a major. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now I feel like I'm doing what I want to do, and I'm not  
too concerned about my golf swing,'' he said. ``I want to be more 
mentally prepared playing the golf course than thinking about my 
golf swing. I want to be more result-oriented rather than 
swing-oriented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watson said Monday's practice round was enough to refresh his  
memory of Pinehurst No. 2 and its difficulty around the greens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just going over strategy with my caddie Bruce Edwards  
and it really came back pretty quickly where you should hit it and 
shouldn't hit it on the golf course,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson turns 50 on Sept. 4 and said he plans to play on the  
Senior Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``It very well may be my last time at the U.S. Open, but I don't  
plan on it,'' said Watson, who qualified this year because he was 
among the top 30 money leaders in 1998.

	 *WOODS RETURNS:* Tiger Woods last played a tournament in  
Pinehurst in 1992 as a junior golfer on course No. 7. This week, he 
returns as the second-ranked player in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boy, things have changed a lot since then,'' Woods said. ``I  
guess one thing is I got a little more in my pocket now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods has won close to $1.9 million this season and the  
attention level has gone through the roof for one of the game's 
more popular figures. Woods drew one of the larger galleries for 
the first three practice days of the Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``My life has changed from the fact that when I go out in public  
people recognize me,'' said Woods, who won that junior event in 
Pinehurst as a 16-year-old. ``When I was a junior golfer nobody 
knew me. A lot has changed since then, but one thing that has 
remained the same is I love to play.''

	 *EARLY BIRDS:* The U.S. Golf Association will push up tee times  
during Thursday and Friday rounds to 6:30 a.m., about a half-hour 
earlier than normal. 
</P>
<P>
	Jumbo Ozaki, David Toms and Brendel Chamblee will get the early  
bird honors in the opening round, while Sven Struver, Jeff 
Gallagher and Andrew Magee tee off first Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The USGA said the early tee times are not necessarily aimed at  
slow play in the 156-player field, but as a safeguard against 
thunderstorms that can plague the South during June afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we run into some weather delays, we wanted to make sure  
that we've used all the available daylight and don't leave players 
out on the golf course Thursday and Friday,'' said USGA vice 
president Trey Holland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd feel bad if we had five groups that are out on Friday and  
we need to make a cut and we started at 7 o'clock. We would have 
lost a half-hour of daylight over the course of the day.'' 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	 *PRICELESS:* Nick Price sounded like a man in a midlife crisis  
heading into this week's Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Price, 42, said playing competitive golf around the world has  
become harder since his three children are getting older. 
</P>
<P>
	``They understand why I go away but I don't know if they accept  
it,'' Price said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Price said he especially misses spending time with his  
8-year-old son Gregory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every week it's like climbing a mountain,'' said Price, who  
was born in South Africa and lives in Florida. ``You start off at 
the bottom every week and you try and get to the top. Whether you 
get halfway or two-thirds of the way up you've got to start again 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes if you're not mentally ready to do it, ... it's a  
difficult thing. That's what happens when you get older, when 
you've been climbing that mountain time and time again it just gets 
a bit much and you want to do something else with your life. You go 
through it when you're in your 20s, in your 30s and you go through 
it a little more often when you get into your 40s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Price was the game's dominant player in 1993-94, winning a  
combined nine times. He has won only two times since, although he 
is 23rd on this year's money list with $767,005. 
</P>
<P>
	Price was playing well several months ago, but since finishing  
third in the Players Championship and tied for sixth at the 
Masters, he has finished 60th, 51st, 12th and 42nd in his last four 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be very happy now to shoot even-par for the week,''  
Price said of his 13th Open. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PINEHURST IN?:* This is the first U.S. Open staged at Pinehurst  
No. 2 -- but likely not the last. 
</P>
<P>
	USGA president Buzz Taylor on Wednesday praised the work the  
resort and its workers have done in preparing for the Open -- only 
the second one ever held in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the USGA said they don't have certain courses in a  
rotation, places like Oakmont (Pa.) Country Club and Baltusrol Golf 
Club in New Jersey have hosted seven U.S. Open's each. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that if this week is successful, and I can't imagine  
that it would not be, I'm certain that there would be some ongoing 
discussions with the Pinehurst community about coming back at some 
point,'' said USGA vice president Trey Holland. 
</P>
<P>
	Holland refused to give a timetable of when discussions of a  
possible return would begin. He also said the USGA was looking at 
holding other Opens in the South, but also wouldn't reveal any 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WEATHER WATCH:* One thing the USGA didn't expect when awarding  
the Open to Pinehurst was cool weather in North Carolina in 
mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
	But the four-day event looks like it will escape a major heat  
wave. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather forecast for Thursday's opening round calls for a  
high temperature around 75 degrees. That's 12 degrees below normal 
for this time of year. The weather from Friday-Sunday should be in 
the low 80s. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening round could be plagued by rain, some heavy at times.

<HEADLINE> De La Hoya To Be Super Welterweight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Oscar De La Hoya said Wednesday he  
will leave the welterweight division to become a super welterweight 
after his Sept. 18 ``battle of the welterweights'' in Las Vegas 
with Felix Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been difficult for me to make the weight in this  
division, and if I beat Trinidad and he wants a rematch, it'll have 
to be in the superwelter category,'' De La Hoya, the World Boxing 
Council welterweight champion, said. ``I'm not a natural welter. 
I'm not going to fight anymore as a welter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Welterweights weigh between 147 and 153 pounds, super  
welterweights between 154 and 159. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya made the comments during a joint news conference  
Wednesday with Trinidad in Trinidad's native San Juan. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya (31-0) said he will begin training July 1 in the  
California mountains to be in top shape to face Trinidad, the 
International Boxing Federation welterweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm careful and train well, as I'm going to do, I will make  
my weight for this fight,'' De La Hoya said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight will unify the two boxing federations, and the winner  
will take both champion titles. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya has been world champion in the super featherweight,  
lightweight, super lightweight and welterweight categories. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya was received by his Puerto Rican opponent's  
supporters holding a sign that read ``from champion to champion, 
welcome to Tito Trinidad's house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad was on the offensive Wednesday, repeating his  
prediction that he would knock out De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to pay dearly for his declaration that I'm not  
worth $10 million. That's the money I'm going to win in this 
fight,'' Trinidad said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad's promoter, Don King, will get $2 million of that  
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Felix Trinidad Sr., the boxer's father and trainer, said he  
believes De La Hoya is going to go down ``like a dead man'' in 
front of his son and predicts the California native will not make 
it to the sixth round. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 200 Trinidad supporters were on hand for the press  
conference, and at times there were shouts of ``You're going to get 
knocked out!'' from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya admitted the fans' rowdiness unnerved him a bit.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little nervous. I'm not a robot, I'm a human being,'' De  
La Hoya said.

<HEADLINE> Elie Savors Sights on Road to Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Mario Elie has been down this road before.  
Twice he's been to the NBA Finals, and twice he's walked away a 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, he's with the San Antonio Spurs. And this title would  
mean the most to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started a new leaf here in San Antonio,'' said Elie, who was  
signed this season to add playoff grit to the mix. ``It's a great 
franchise, from the owner to the ball boys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elie and the Spurs faced the New York Knicks on Wednesday night  
to start the best-of-7 NBA Finals in the Alamodome. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got everybody in the world watching you play. I'm  
excited. I love this part of the year,'' Elie said Wednesday 
morning after a shootaround. ``I've been through the wars before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs are playing in their first finals. The Knicks last won  
a title in 1973 and are the first eighth-seeded team to reach the 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	New York has showed remarkable resiliency, finding a way to win  
the Eastern Conference finals over Indiana despite injuries to 
Patrick Ewing and Larry Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't keep Elie, who grew up near Madison Square Garden,  
from offering a jab on the eve of the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is probably -- not disrespecting the Knicks -- the weakest  
team we're going to play in the playoffs,'' Elie said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks have heard these kinds of dismissals before.  
</P>
<P>
	``We might not be the most talented, but I tell you one thing,  
we're going to come out and compete,'' Latrell Sprewell said. 
</P>
<P>
	By game day, Elie was measuring his words more carefully.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Knicks are a terrific team,'' he said. ``Don't  
underestimate your opponent, just go out and play hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A son of Haitian immigrants, Elie grew up in Manhattan and  
played basketball for Power Memorial High School, the alma mater of 
Kareem Abdul--Jabbar. He was honored as one of the city's 10 best 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	His college test scores weren't strong, so he headed to American  
International College in Springfield, Mass. He finished as the 
school's career scoring leader and earned a degree in human 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
	After getting drafted and cut by Milwaukee, Elie played in  
Portugal, Argentina and Ireland as well as the U.S. Basketball 
League and CBA. He finally made the NBA in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Those early years of struggle toughened him. He hasn't forgotten  
the cheap hotels and low-budget life of the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Elie won his first NBA championship with the Houston Rockets  
against the Knicks in 1994 in a series that went seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	The next year the Rockets swept Orlando 4-0 to win another  
title, with Elie scoring 22 points in Game 4 on 4-of-6 shooting 
from 3-point range. He also was a key defensive weapon and averaged 
14.3 points in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	His biggest shot during the 1995 playoffs was a 3-pointer in the  
waning seconds of Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals that 
sealed Houston's victory over Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Elie left Houston as a free agent feeling unappreciated after  
last season. He insists there are no longer hard feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Spurs, Elie realized right away his role would be to  
help point guard Avery Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Elie criticized stars David Robinson and Tim Duncan early in the  
season for not showing enough emotion. After a 6-8 start in 
February, the Spurs finished the regular season 31-5. Elie's 
passion began to reveal itself on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just felt I just needed to add my little spice into the  
team,'' he said. ``I just let my opinion be heard. I took a lot of 
flak for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elie would savor this championship. He is a starter and  
emotional leader, a far bigger role than when he was with Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, Elie said, the Spurs' championship rings would probably  
be bigger than those he got from the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking at the big Chicago Bulls' rings. I'm like, 'I've  
got a little Mighty Mouse ring compared to them guys,' '' Elie 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of all, he said, he relishes the fact that this is San  
Antonio's first finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``To win a finals for the first time with this great city and  
the great support we receive, it would be a privilege,'' Elie said. 
``We've got a chance to make history.''

<HEADLINE> Johnson Suits Up for Game 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Larry Johnson made a surprising start in the  
opener of the NBA Finals, showing no discomfort from the sprained 
right knee that had threatened to keep him out of the series. 
</P>
<P>
	He was fitted with a bulky brace but took it off just before the  
game against the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday night, replacing it 
with a wrap to protect the knee. He also had his right elbow and 
left knee wrapped. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a tough guy,'' New York Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said,  
``so I was not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``He feels he can be effective so he's giving it a shot. We  
wanted him out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allan Houston walked through a nearly empty Knicks locker room  
before the game and in a singsong voice said, ``He's baa-ck!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Him being in the lineup is an inspiration,'' Chris Childs  
said. ``His even being on the court is an inspiration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson guarded David Robinson and got into foul trouble right  
away, sending him to the bench. He had no trouble getting up and 
down the court and scored five points through three quarters, well 
below his playoff average of 12.7. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Johnson strolled into the shootaround with  
no limp, no grimace, no sign that his right knee wasn't right -- 
except for the huge brace. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson talked about how he would make the gametime decision of  
whether to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not bad,'' he said. ``We've got a ways to go. It's a  
matter of what I can and can't do and when I can help the team. If 
I can be productive at 50 percent, I'll go out there at 50 percent. 
I may be more than 50 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson absorbed a rolling block from Travis Best in last  
Friday's final game of the Indiana series, and Van Gundy knew that 
it might have sidelined him for the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Larry always wants to play,'' Van Gundy said. ``But this was  
not a minor injury. This is a Grade 2 sprain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such injuries usually take 10-14 days to heal. Johnson was  
injured five days ago. 
</P>
<P>
	His recovery time has been limited by the NBA schedule. Each  
day, Johnson said, the knee feels better. The question is whether 
there have been enough days. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was better yesterday and it feels much better today,'' he  
said. ``Another day of rest would help. Two days would help more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks are already playing shorthanded because of Patrick  
Ewing's season-ending injury, a tear of the Achilles' tendon. 
Without Johnson, New York has even more trouble against the Spurs' 
front line, anchored by 7-footers Tim Duncan and Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said pain would not be an issue.  
</P>
<P>
	``The doctors assured me there would be pain,'' he said.  
``That's not a problem. When I come back, if I can bang and grab 
rebounds, make some post moves, that's enough.''

<HEADLINE> Pug Pulled on Rentable DVDs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The developers of Divx, a for-rent version of  
digital video disks, pulled the plug on the new technology today 
after failing to attract enough retailers and movie studios. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit City and a Los Angeles entertainment-law firm withdrew  
Divx two years after launching plans to make a DVD that can be 
viewed once and then thrown away. 
</P>
<P>
	Divx was mired in controversy from the start. The Divx  
encryption technology required specially encoded discs and players; 
in addition, the new DVDs didn't work on existing DVD players that 
people already bought, threatening to confuse consumers over what 
to buy. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit City, a major consumer electronics chain, said movie  
studios didn't make enough movies to play in the format, and other 
stores failed to come on board. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the significant consumer enthusiasm, we cannot create  
a viable business without support in these essential areas,'' said 
Richard Sharp, chief executive of Circuit City Stores and the Divx 
venture, called Digital Video Express. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital Video Express will provide a $100 cash rebate to all  
consumers who purchased Divx-enhanced players prior to today. 
Circuit City announced this morning that it will take a $114 
million charge to shut down the business. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital video discs look like audio CDs, but store information  
on both sides and are promoted as the replacement to video 
cassettes. In addition to greater storage capacity, they offer 
superior movie images and sound, and viewers can skip to any scene.

<HEADLINE> Senate Pushing Steel, Oil, Gas Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Struggling U.S. steel, oil and natural gas  
companies may soon get some relief through $1.5 billion in 
taxpayer-backed emergency loans under Senate consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate vote could come as early as today, a day after  
legislation creating the loan programs cleared a key procedural 
hurdle. The Senate voted 70-29 on Tuesday to limit debate on the 
bill. That is 10 more votes than the 60 needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong support on the procedural matter signaled that the  
bill's supporters would prevail. Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said 
the future of the U.S. steel industry was at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are we going to ship another U.S. industry, the steel  
industry, overseas?'' he asked colleagues. ``Are we going to allow 
foreign entities to make ghost towns of our steel-dependent 
communities?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A similar program for small oil and gas firms was added earlier  
as part of a compromise with Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide $1 billion in loans to domestic steel  
producers injured by low-priced imports and $500 million for U.S. 
oil and natural gas industries hurt by sagging prices. The taxpayer 
cost for the new loan programs is put at $270 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative senators who opposed the bill argued that the extra  
spending would come directly from Social Security surpluses -- money 
that Republicans have pledged repeatedly this year not to touch. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't be for not plundering the Social Security trust fund  
and be for this'' steel and oil bill, said Sen. Phil Gramm, 
R-Texas, an oil-producing state. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before debating the bill, GOP senators lost their latest  
attempt to end Democratic delaying tactics against another measure 
that would make it harder for Congress to spend Social Security 
money for anything other than the pension program. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate previously approved the steel-loan program as part of  
an emergency spending bill to fund Kosovo operations. But 
supporters backed down during negotiations with the House when the 
provision threatened to sink the Kosovo spending package. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of a procedural move, the loan bill is expected to  
bypass the normal House committee process and go directly to the 
full House if the Senate passes it. 
</P>
<P>
	Steel companies that qualify would be able to borrow $25 million  
to $250 million at market interest rates. Independent producers and 
other companies in the U.S. oil and gas service industries could 
borrow up to $10 million each. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say many companies now have problems borrowing money  
from banks because of uncertainties about the industries' future. 
</P>
<P>
	Steel companies would be able to make use of the loans through  
the end of 2001 and would have six years to pay the money back. Oil 
and gas companies would have five years to borrow money.

<HEADLINE> Cover Story: Michael Hartman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- In a perfect world, Michael Hartman's debut  
CD would sell a million copies and his place among the guitar 
greats would be assured. 
</P>
<P>
	In his decidedly imperfect world, though, Hartman hopes his  
instrumental rock album, ``Black Glue,'' finds an audience large 
enough to earn him a second release. If not, he'll no doubt find a 
way to gather strength from the setback -- something he's learned 
from living with cystic fibrosis, a disease that may kill him 
within 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But the disease helped introduce him to his guitar hero, Steve  
Vai, a break that gained him passage through industry doors -- a 
journey other would-be rock stars only dream about. But cystic 
fibrosis, a hereditary disorder that can lead to fatal lung 
infections, leaves Hartman, 23, sickly and constrained. 
</P>
<P>
	He points to the catheter shunt implanted in his forearm, the  
gateway for antibiotics he takes to treat the ailment he likens to 
``having the common cold all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was a perfect world, there would be no limitations, but  
it's not a perfect world,'' Hartman says. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they say I can't do it, I usually try 10 times harder to  
do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such determination helped create ``Black Glue,'' the CD Hartman  
co-produced with guitarist John Christ of Danzig and released by 
Fuel 2000 Records. A portion of the proceeds from sales goes to 
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation of America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Black Glue'' has quickly become a critical success. The Gavin  
report, an industry journal, called it ``a brilliant record full of 
adrenalized rockers and mellow acoustic gems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reviewer Paul Gargano wrote in Metal Edge magazine: ``Whether  
he's raging in full-on rock splendor or approaching his art from a 
more embattled personal side ... `Black Glue' is the guitarist's 
gently weeping, loudly screeching statement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One song, ``Pooh's Day Off,'' was featured in the Sandra  
Bullock-Ben Affleck movie ``Forces of Nature'' and is due to be 
released as a single this month. 
</P>
<P>
	But commercial success is more elusive, especially in the realm  
of instrumental guitarists dominated by Vai, Jeff Beck and Joe 
Satriani. By the end of May, the nationally released CD had sold 
only 300 copies. 
</P>
<P>
	During an Indy 500 weekend street concert in Indianapolis,  
Hartman nervously acknowledged his music's limited appeal, 
explaining to an appreciative audience numbering in the hundreds 
that it was ``left of normal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a lengthy interview before the show, though, he was more  
upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``My music is what makes me feel alive,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, it was enough to drive an Indiana teen-ager to seek  
fortune and fame -- and to find it -- in the Los Angeles music scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't look at it as overnight success, because I've been  
playing since I was 7 years old,'' Hartman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Black Glue'' could very well describe the nightmare of living  
with the sticky, thick secretions that impair the breathing and 
digestion for Hartman and other cystic fibrosis sufferers. Mucus in 
the lungs slows the removal of dust and germs and causes infections 
and lung damage. In the digestive tract, it stops nutrients from 
being absorbed. Only half of the people with the disease live into 
their 30s. 
</P>
<P>
	The 110 pounds clinging to Hartman's 5-foot-7 frame leave him  
gaunt despite a daily infusion of about 8,000 calories. Vulnerable 
to the flu and colds, he fled the unpredictable winters of his 
native Marion five years ago and relocated to California. He lives 
in the desert north of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	He had gained a taste for California three years earlier, when  
he was 15. That's when his doctors enrolled him in the Make-A-Wish 
Foundation. ``They didn't think I was going to be around much 
longer,'' Hartman said. 
</P>
<P>
	He survived, and he also got his wish -- a trip to California to  
meet Vai, who became a friend and mentor encouraging Hartman to 
pursue his dream while opening industry doors for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what lit the fire, because I saw what he had,'' Hartman  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That put the spark in his mind,'' agreed Doug Weaver,  
Hartman's first guitar instructor back in Marion. ``Vai took him 
under his wing. I think that was probably the biggest step he 
took.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hartman was just 7 when he began working with Weaver. Hartman's  
mother, Marsha, had just bought her son his first guitar, knowing 
he wouldn't be playing sports with the other kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think his cystic fibrosis put him ahead of the other kids,  
because he wanted to strive to be the best,'' Weaver said. 
</P>
<P>
	By age 15, Hartman's guitar mastery had progressed to the point  
that he became an instructor, teaching students twice his age. 
</P>
<P>
	After high school, he attended the Musicians Institute in  
Hollywood. At night, he hung out at clubs, meeting working 
guitarists and handing out tapes of his songs. A big break came in 
August 1997, when he followed in the footsteps of Vai and another 
idol, Eddie Van Halen, to become the lead guitarist playing 
alongside David Lee Roth. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined Roth for the recording of ``DLR Band,'' and two of his  
songs appeared on the CD, retitled as ``King of the Hill'' and 
``Indeed I Do.'' (The songs appear in their original, instrumental 
form on ``Black Glue'' as ``Stomp'' and ``Southern Romp.'') 
</P>
<P>
	Playing with Roth was a personal achievement.  
</P>
<P>
	``You gain the respect of all the other guitarists. For me, that  
was like my golden cup,'' Hartman said. 
</P>
<P>
	He lost his grip on the cup the following January when a drunken  
driver hit the car carrying Hartman and his wife, Jeanie. She 
suffered a broken leg and broken pelvis. Hartman had a concussion 
and bruised ribs. He later returned to the hospital with pneumonia 
and exhaustion. That May, Roth dismissed him. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartman looks back on the experience now as a stepping stone. He  
returned to Vai's studio to finish ``Black Glue,'' the project he 
had shelved to join Roth. His goal is to sell about 80,000 copies 
of the CD, enough, he feels, to land a second album contract. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, he wangles touring dates, hopes to sell more  
songs for movie use and may head to Japan or Europe to hold guitar 
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm my own boss now, and I'm doing very well financially,  
physically and musically,'' Hartman said. ``My dream job was to be 
a musician who could support himself and his wife playing guitar.''

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Gears Up for 2006 Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SION, Switzerland (AP) -- On trains, buses, wine bottles,  
umbrellas, even toilet paper, Sion's bid for the 2006 Winter 
Olympics is hard to miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Backed by high approval ratings and government support, the  
red-and-white logo and the Olympic rings are flourishing as 
expectations mount that this small city in southern Switzerland 
will land the biggest prize in winter sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Adolf Ogi, Swiss sports minister and president of the Olympic  
bid, says it is ``now or never'' for third-time bidder Sion, which 
first tried for the games in 1976 and lost out to Salt Lake City 
for the 2002 event. 
</P>
<P>
	Stung by their loss to Utah, the Swiss bidders polished up their  
campaign and claim to have improved their plans significantly. 
</P>
<P>
	An IOC evaluation team earlier this year gave Sion a glowing  
report, far better than its nearest rival, Italy's Turin. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the criteria are technical, it is Sion which should win,''  
says Director-General Jean-Daniel Mudry, looking forward to the 
final vote Saturday by International Olympic Committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	This provincial capital of some 26,000 people, in the Rhone  
Valley east of Lake Geneva, is the smallest Olympic center of the 
six bidders, with organizers promising a ``family atmosphere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Olympic village would be built within walking distance of  
the downtown Place de la Planta, where medal ceremonies would be 
held, and in sight of the main skiing and snowboarding venues. 
</P>
<P>
	High on the Alps above Sion, the resorts of Crans Montana and  
Veysonnaz, both regular stops on the World Cup circuit, face each 
other across the valley. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid committee boasts that 10 of the 14 Olympic venues would  
be within a half-hour drive or 25-mile radius of Sion. 
</P>
<P>
	Although many Olympic sites are already in place, major  
investments are planned to upgrade ice hockey and curling venues, 
as well as the soccer stadium that would host opening and closing 
ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ski-jump facilities would be built from scratch in Crans  
Montana, although on the site of an old ski jump. And a new 
speedskating oval is planned at Martigny, near Sion. 
</P>
<P>
	For the bobsled and luge, bidders have picked the world-famous  
Cresta run in distant St. Moritz -- a 30-minute flight, but about 7 
hours by road from Sion. 
</P>
<P>
	Cross-country skiing and biathlon events would take place in the  
Goms Valley, 56 miles and 1 1/2 hours by road east of the Olympic 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	Other well-known resorts -- including Verbier and Zermatt, whose  
famous peak, the Matterhorn, dominates the Sion bid logo -- will 
host VIPs. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials here recognize technical merits won't be the only  
factor in the choice for 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	But they insist that the corruption scandal that has engulfed  
the IOC, based in nearby Lausanne, hasn't affected Sion's chances. 
</P>
<P>
	After senior Swiss IOC member Marc Hodler last December claimed  
widespread corruption in the selection of Olympic host cities, 
local media worried that Sion's prospects suffered serious damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the emotional phase, I think the IOC members realized  
that it has nothing to do with the candidacy,'' Mudry says. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal had no impact on Sion's sponsorship efforts, he  
adds. But he regrets the fact that, under new rules, visits to bid 
cities by IOC members are banned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a shame, because the IOC members don't have the  
chance to get an idea (of the bid),'' he says. ``As for the ones 
who came last time, we would have liked to show them that we've 
improved the concept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC evaluators gave the bid high marks for environmental and  
transport credentials. They were also positive about plans to put 
most of the Olympic venues to use after the games. 
</P>
<P>
	But in this acutely environment-conscious country, not everyone  
is impressed. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Wide Fund for Nature, which also has raised concerns  
about bids from Turin and Klagenfurt, has objected to the Sion bid, 
dismissing the sustainable development plan as ``a marketing 
argument.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Remembering the $57 million deficit left by the 1992 Winter  
Games over the French border in Albertville, locals appear more 
concerned about the financing of the event. 
</P>
<P>
	And they question whether the 2,500 jobs promised for the next  
six years would remain beyond the Games, giving a permanent lift to 
one of Switzerland's less prosperous regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudry, however, identifies ``the political support and the  
support of the population, which weren't so strong in 2002,'' as 
the factors making the difference this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogi has given Sion enthusiastic backing, and the Swiss public  
seems to agree. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 67 percent voted in favor of an Olympic bid in a state  
referendum here in 1997. A poll for Swiss television in early May 
showed 79 percent in favor of the country playing host to the 
Olympics and 65 percent confident of a Swiss win.

<HEADLINE> Colonial Downs Reaches Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Colonial Downs avoided having its  
off-track-betting parlor licenses suspended Wednesday when it gave 
the Virginia Racing Commission a freshly signed contract with the 
state's thoroughbred horsemen. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission said it was reserving its right to impose the  
penalty later. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the contract, the commission likely was going to enforce  
a hearing officer's recommendation that the track's OTB licenses be 
suspended for five days and that the parlors remain closed until 
the deal was reached. Horsemen have been without a contract since 
Dec. 31 and are scheduled to have a 25-day meet at the track this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-year agreement, hammered out this week and signed  
shortly before the commission meeting, marks ``a new day for horse 
racing in Virginia,'' chief negotiator David Cook of the Virginia 
Horsemen's Protective and Benevolent Association said. 
</P>
<P>
	Colonial Downs lost $5.3 million last year, and Cook said the  
deal gives the troubled track a year to get its financial house in 
order before the HPBA members begin getting a greater percentage of 
the OTB betting revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract still requires the approval of the commission. VRC  
chairwoman Robin Traywick Williams said she didn't like all the 
terms revealed during the meeting, but would reserve judgment until 
she'd seen the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``What really concerns me is with such a limited amount of purse  
money for the next two years, there will be no growth in racing 
that I can see,'' Williams said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The horsemen are over a barrel,'' she said, and probably  
inclined to take what they could get rather than risk having no 
meet at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get as much as you can, but you don't always get  
everything you want,'' Cook told the commission. ``The horsemen 
achieved many of their goals in these negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woodberry Payne, president of the HPBA, and Cook said the group  
decided not to nit-pick over numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not dealing with their finances and examining their  
ledger sheets,'' Payne said outside the meeting. ``We constructed a 
contract that was beneficial for the horsemen and gave us purses 
that would work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal has three components, Cook said. It allows the track to  
hold its fall thoroughbred meet this year with a lump sum of $3.125 
million in purses for 25 racing dates, then begin depositing 5 1/4 
percent of the handle from the track's four OTBs into prize money 
accounts for the meets in 2000 and 2001. The deposits would begin 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides also agreed to work harder on securing a location and  
permit for an OTB parlor in populous northern Virginia, seen by 
many as the key to the track's survival, and to improve quarters 
for horsemen who live at the track during meets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today should be nothing but positive news for the horse  
industry and Colonial Downs,'' track lawyer Jim Weiberg told the 
commission. The contract is based on conservative projections of 
$90 million in handle for this year, and would provide $4 million 
or more for purses even after debts are repaid in the ensuing two 
years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A portion of the 25-page contract also must be approved by the  
Maryland Jockey Club, which is under contract to run the meets at 
Colonial Downs. H. Lane Kneedler, lawyer for the MJC, told the 
commission he had not yet reviewed the entire document and could 
not say whether the jockey club would approve it. 
</P>
<P>
	The OTB license suspensions and parlor closures were recommended  
by VRC executive secretary Stanley K. Bowker after the track failed 
to meet a commission deadline for reaching an agreement with the 
horsemen.

<HEADLINE> Gates, O'Neal Unveil Web Safety Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nick Walker wouldn't be able to recognize the  
richest man in the world if Bill Gates walked up to him in person -- 
and Gates did just that Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 9-year-old boy looked past Gates and toward the man  
beside him drawing oohs and aahs from all of Nick's friends inside 
the Boys &AMP; Girls Club computer room, NBA superstar Shaquille O'Neal 
of the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Gates and O'Neal visited the center in a residential  
section of Washington to introduce a new program intended to teach 
children how to use the Internet safely. The ``Stay Safe Online'' 
program will be tested at the Boys &AMP; Girls Club of America's 15 new 
technology centers in rural and inner-city communities. O'Neal 
contributed $1 million to the program; Microsoft, the corporation 
headed by Gates, donated $1.1 million, plus software worth $400,000 
and technical support. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-minute, interactive and animated program features O'Neal  
and others providing advice on Internet safety. Among the 
suggestions: Never provide personal information over the Web and 
never meet anyone in person who was introduced to them on the 
Internet. The program is a requisite for any child wanting to use 
the computer centers. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal said he often went to the Boys &AMP; Girls club when he was  
growing up in New Jersey and that the center helped him stay out of 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only computer we had back then was Atari,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Chain Gangs Come To Massachusetts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) -- Chain gangs, once a symbol of pitiless  
Southern justice, have come to Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	What is believed to be Massachusetts' first such work crew  
painted an iron fence at a drug treatment center Wednesday under 
the watch of armed guards. The men were shackled to each other with 
5 feet of chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson prefers the term ``tandem  
work crews'' and noted that the inmates volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chain gangs were meant to break people down. My program is the  
complete opposite -- it builds self-esteem and self confidence, and 
helps them know they've accomplished something,'' Hodgson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prisoners, dressed in red shirts and pants, quickly shouted  
out some benefits of working on the chain gang: Relieves stress. 
Benefits the community. Beats hanging around prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't been out for 15 months,'' said a 37-year-old  
prisoner named Scott, who asked that his last name not be used. 
``We just wanted the opportunity to be in the fresh air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chain gangs, largely black crews, broke rocks and built roads in  
the South in the late 19th century. By 1970, they had vanished in 
much of the country with the advent of civil rights and prison 
reform movements. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1990s, chain gangs began to resurface, first in Alabama,  
followed by Arizona, Florida and Iowa. Maricopa County, Ariz., 
started one for women, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials insist today's chain gangs are far from the shackled  
prison crews that gained infamy in song (Sam Cooke's ``Chain 
Gang'') and film (``Cool Hand Luke''). 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to be working quite well,'' said Gary McClelland, a  
prison supervisor in Wisconsin, where the first chain gang went to 
work in 1997. ``They work on community projects and it's been very 
well-received.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Bristol County, the new program involves only those inmates  
convicted of nonviolent offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's humiliating at all,'' said Kevin, 39,  
serving 2 1/2 years on a probation violation related to drunken 
driving convictions. ``It's more humiliating for your friends and 
family to see you being arrested, or in court. It's more 
humiliating to sit behind the prison walls every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amnesty International has challenged the chain gangs in the past  
and recently called for an end to chain gangs in Massachusetts. A 
caucus of black state lawmakers said it will file legislation to 
ban the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``These aren't hardened criminals,'' said Joshua Rubenstein,  
Northeast regional director for Amnesty International. ``The chain 
gang is a form of gratuitous humiliation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from at least two Massachusetts towns -- Fairhaven and  
Westport -- have declined to participate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it goes back to pre-civil rights days,'' said Winfred  
Eckenreiter, a Fairhaven selectman and former prosecutor. ``Most of 
us are happy we've gotten past that.''

<HEADLINE> Coke's Belgian Ban May Soon End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The Belgium government will decide  
Thursday whether to lift its ban on Coca-Cola soft drinks, while 
safety fears lingered in several European countries following the 
hospitalization of dozens of Belgians who drank the company's 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	Spain on Wednesday joined Belgium, France, Luxembourg and the  
Netherlands in restricting or banning Coke drinks after Coke 
admitted Tuesday to production problems at two of its plants which 
serve Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past several weeks, several dozen Belgian youngsters  
who drank Coke products have been hospitalized with vomiting, 
stomach pains and nausea. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke chairman M. Douglas Ivester, in his first public statement  
since the contamination scare hit, sought to reassure Coke's 
customers that it is ``taking all necessary steps to ensure that 
all our products meet the highest quality standards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We deeply regret any problems encountered by our European  
customers in the past few days,'' Ivester said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke has maintained that despite the hospitalizations, tests  
showed the problems at the two factories didn't cause any health 
dangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Still some Belgians started swearing off Coke drinks Wednesday  
and analysts warned the company could face a consumer backlash, 
just as its sales in Europe have been crimped by stagnant 
economies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've stopped drinking it, and I don't think I will start  
again,'' said Natalie Sinnodt, 23, a social worker. ``I should have 
stopped anyway for diet reasons, this makes it easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't touch it,'' added Chau Line, 27, a secretary.  
</P>
<P>
	The Spanish government Wednesday froze a shipment of 8,000  
bottles of Belgian-produced Coke and other Coca-Cola brands in the 
northern province of Zamora. The Health Ministry insisted the move 
was strictly precautionary. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgium banned all Coke products on Monday and Luxembourg  
followed with a similar ban on Tuesday including Fanta, Sprite, 
Aquarius, Bonaqua and Minute Maid fruit juices. The French 
government ordered the withdrawal of all canned Coke products, 50 
million cans. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, Coke's Dutch arm -- at the request of the  
government -- recalled all its products originating from Belgium and 
ordered its distributors in the Netherlands to stop any imports of 
Coca-Cola products from Belgian suppliers. In some parts of 
northwest Germany, officials also removed Coke products from store 
shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belgian government said Health Minister Luc Van den Bossche  
will decide Thursday whether to lift or extend the ban. The 
decision will be made on the basis of scientific tests conducted on 
samples from the production plants where the problems occurred in 
Antwerp and Dunkirk, France, said a government statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgian's government is keen to show it's taking tough action to  
protect consumers who are still reeling from a recent scandal over 
meat, eggs and dairy products infected with cancer-causing dioxins 
that led to international bans on Belgian food. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's mishandling of dioxin scare was a major factor  
in the ruling center-left parties taking a battering in national 
elections Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	At Coke's Atlanta headquarters, spokesman Rob Baskin said  
Wednesday that the company first received reports from Belgian 
customers of bad-tasting drinks on June 8 and within two days had 
removed from store shelves 2.5 million bottles produced at the 
Antwerp plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke acknowledged that the Antwerp plant used substandard carbon  
dioxide to put bubbles into bottled drinks. 
</P>
<P>
	It traced foul-smelling cans to the Dunkirk plant, removed them  
from vending machines and took out newspaper ads urging customers 
to return cans with certain production codes. The foul smell was 
traced to a fungicide on wooden pallets used to transport the cans 
from the Dunkirk plant to Belgium, Baskin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke said that the problems were confined to the Belgian market.  
In France, the company set up an emergency hotline for worried 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke's actions seemed to convince European Union authorities.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have the impression that Coca-Cola has taken the situation  
in hand ... has taken measures to resolve the problem as quickly as 
possible,'' said Pietro Petrucci, consumer affairs spokesman for 
the EU's executive body, the European Commission. ``I see a rapid 
solution, because the situation is rather clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, analysts and retail groups warned Coke could face a  
consumer backlash. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vendors we've talked to said that consumers are beginning to  
express deep concerns,'' said Guy Francheteau, an agro-food analyst 
at the brokerage house Pinatton in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	He compared the case to the scare over Perrier mineral water in  
1990, when traces of Benzene were found in some of its bottles on 
the U.S. market. That scare was believed to have cost the French 
company $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippe Lenfant, the general manager of Coca-Cola Belgium, said  
Tuesday the company has not yet calculated the amount of money it 
stands to lose from the European bans. Coke estimates 26 percent of 
its $18.8 billion sales are in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke shares gained a minimal 12 1/2 cents to $63.87 1/2 on the New  
York Stock Exchange Wednesday on a day when most stocks soared. The 
stock has lost about $4 in the past week.

<HEADLINE> Garbo's Ashes Buried in Sweden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- No media or onlookers showed up to see  
Greta Garbo's ashes buried -- and that's just the way her family 
wanted it. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of the reclusive screen star tricked people into  
thinking the ceremony would be held Thursday instead of Wednesday, 
when the ashes were buried at Woodland Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	Garbo's small urn was lowered below ground by ribbons blue and  
gold, the colors of Sweden's flag. Only a handful of family and 
friends were present. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1930s-era star of film classics such as ``Mata Hari,''  
``Anna Karenina'' and ``Grand Hotel,'' with her famous line, ``I 
want to be alone,'' died in New York City in 1990 at age 84. 
</P>
<P>
	She was cremated and the ashes kept at a New York mortuary while  
her niece and sole heir, Gray Reisfield, decided what to do with 
them.

<HEADLINE> Immigrant Benefits Bill Introduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A cadre of Senate Republicans, including  
presidential hopeful John McCain, introduced legislation to restore 
health coverage cut by Congress in 1996 for low-income immigrant 
children and pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
	The Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act of 1999 could  
restore Medicaid eligibility to 130,000 children and 50,000 
pregnant women annually and allow states, if they wish, to open up 
their new children's health insurance programs to all uninsured 
legal immigrant children. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1996, legal immigrants in this country lost critical public  
benefits because of changes made under welfare reform,'' said Sen. 
John Chafee, R-R.I., chief sponsor of the bill. ``While I supported 
the underlying goals of welfare reform -- self-sufficiency and 
individual responsibility -- I continue to believe that the cuts 
made to immigrants' benefits as part of the 1996 reforms were 
unwarranted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Chafee and McCain, R-Ariz., in sponsoring the  
legislation were Republican Sens. Connie Mack of Florida and James 
Jeffords of Vermont and Democrats Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New 
York and Bob Graham of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Their bill would allow states to extend Medicaid coverage to all  
eligible legal immigrant children and pregnant women, including 
those who arrived after August 1996 -- the cutoff date for immigrant 
benefits. Under current law, states must wait five years before 
extending such coverage to immigrants who arrived after Aug. 22, 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``The consequences of lack of insurance are problematic for  
everyone, but they are particularly serious for children,'' McCain 
said. ``Uninsured and low-income children are less likely to 
receive vital primary and preventative care services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress already has moved twice to soften the blow of the 1996  
welfare reform law, which hit legal immigrants especially hard, 
agreeing to restore disability payments and food stamp benefits to 
certain groups of noncitizens in the country as of August 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congressional Budget Office estimates Chafee's measure would  
cost $490 million over five years.

<HEADLINE> Ind. Chemical Co. in Bromine Flap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Great Lakes Chemical Corp. is  
cooperating with the U.S. Justice Department and the European 
Commission in an antitrust investigation of the bromine business. 
</P>
<P>
	Bromine, a mineral extracted from salt water, is the primary  
material in about a third of Great Lakes' various chemical 
products, which include flame retardants and swimming-pool 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	The specialty chemical company notified authorities of potential  
violations more than a year ago. The company on Tuesday did not 
specify what those violations were, but because of its cooperation 
in the investigation, said Great Lakes will be exempt from any 
criminal prosecution or fines in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is also seeking favorable treatment in Europe under  
a program that rewards self-reporting and cooperation.

<HEADLINE> WTO To Consider U.S. Trade Legality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The World Trade Organization is still deadlocked  
in the search for a new director-general despite signs of growing 
support for former New Zealand Premier Mike Moore, trade diplomats 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the 134 member countries, WTO general council  
chairman Ali Mchumo said there was still no immediate likelihood of 
a decision, and advised them to ``draw the appropriate conclusions 
and act accordingly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mchumo said 80 delegations were prepared to accept Moore -- who  
is backed by the United States and many European nations. But, in 
reference to Japan and other Asian nations, he said several members 
continued to maintain a formal objection. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also no consensus around Moore's rival, Thai deputy  
prime minister Supachai Panitchpakdi, added Mchumo. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO has been without a leader since the departure of Italian  
Renato Ruggiero at the end of April. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, many delegations are suggesting that the only  
possible option now is to drop both candidates and start the 
leadership hunt again from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a move would leave a prolonged and damaging vacuum at the  
head of the world's main trade body just as it prepares to launch a 
new set of trade liberalizing negotiations this fall in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Both candidates have vowed to stay in the race.  
</P>
<P>
	In a previous poll at the end of April, Moore had support from  
62 countries, compared with 59 for Supachai -- the longtime 
frontrunner. 
</P>
<P>
	Mchumo had convened an informal meeting of the council for  
Tuesday, but it was postponed until Wednesday. After meeting for 
four hours, the council adjourned until Friday.

<HEADLINE> Rams' Little Pleads Guilty in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Leonard Little of the St. Louis Rams was  
sentenced to 90 days in jail Wednesday after pleading guilty to 
driving the car that killed a woman in a wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	Little pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter. The  
second-year linebacker could have been sentenced to up to seven 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Gutweiler, 47, was killed last Oct. 19 in downtown St.  
Louis when Little's sports utility vehicle ran a red light and 
broadsided her car. Police said Little, 24, got drunk on his 
birthday at a charity function attended by several Rams players at 
a downtown hotel bar before the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Little will serve his sentence at a medium-security St. Louis  
city jail, but it wasn't immediately clear when he would report. 
</P>
<P>
	After his sentencing, Little apologized to the victim's family  
and pledged to use the experience to help others. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know you all up here in St. Louis don't really know me, but  
back in Tennessee I was a role-model person,'' said Little, a 1998 
third-round draft pick out of Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was doing community service with kids. I'm going to keep  
doing that. What they want me to do now is teach kids not to make 
the same mistake I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gutweiler's relatives said Little got special treatment because  
he is a pro athlete. 
</P>
<P>
	A blood test showed that Little had a blood-alcohol level of  
.19, nearly twice the legal limit of .10, at the time of the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors asked St. Louis Circuit Judge Patricia Cohen for a  
four-year sentence. Instead, the judge gave Little 90 days and 
placed him on probation for four years. She also ordered him to 
perform 1,000 hours of community service with a group that combats 
drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Little also must stay out of bars and avoid alcohol.  
</P>
<P>
	Gutweiler's relatives said Little got special treatment because  
he is a pro athlete. ``I feel it's not fair,'' her teen-age son, 
Michael. 
</P>
<P>
	Little has remained free on bond, but hasn't played for the Rams  
since the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Rams president John Shaw expressed sympathy to Gutweiler's  
family and friends. Shaw said the league office will determine if 
or when Little can return to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will then make an evaluation on his status as a member of  
the St. Louis Rams,'' Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	Little did not participate in either of the team's minicamps  
this spring because coach Dick Vermeil felt it would be a 
distraction. But during the most recent camp last week, Vermeil 
said he would welcome Little back once the legal issues were 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Little also is a defendant in two wrongful-death civil lawsuits,  
one filed by Gutweiler's husband and son, and the other by 
Gutweiler's mother. Both are pending in St. Louis Circuit Court.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola, Hellenic Discuss Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Coca-Cola Beverages PLC said Wednesday that it is  
talking with Hellenic Bottling Company SA about a possible merger 
worth $6.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	If it goes through, the deal would create the dominant drinks  
bottler for the Coca-Cola Co. in eastern and central Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Greece's Hellenic Bottling would hold a majority stake of around  
56 percent in the enlarged group, but Coca-Cola Beverage chief 
executive Neville Isdell would become chief executive of the merged 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca Cola Beverages PLC acknowledged the merger was being  
discussed, but neither company would comment further. It also 
cautioned that an agreement may not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the proposed merger makes strategic sense, would  
fill a management vacuum at the Hellenic operation and is likely to 
please the world's top soft-drink retailer, Coca-Cola Co., which 
holds a majority stake in Coca-Cola Beverages. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged group would be the second-largest bottler for the  
Coca-Cola system in the world with operations spanning 22 
countries, primarily in central and eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	While there is little geographical overlap between the two  
bottlers, analysts say considerable synergy benefits could likely 
be gained from combining bottling plants and distribution networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Beverages has operations in 13 European countries,  
including Ukraine, Belarus and Hungary, while Hellenic operates in 
nine countries, including Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The only countries in which both companies operate is Romania.  
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the move would also fill a management vacuum at  
Hellenic Bottling, which hasn't had a chief executive for about 18 
months.

<HEADLINE> Hasek Talks Big, Backs It Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Dominik Hasek isn't known for words.  
</P>
<P>
	Impossible saves, yes. A few dozen of the world's shiniest  
trophies and medals, yes. An unorthodox style that has him flopping 
around like a flounder on a dock, yes. Wins, yes. 
</P>
<P>
	Words, no.  
</P>
<P>
	History won't immortalize Hasek for the challenge he delivered  
to his struggling teammates before Buffalo's 2-1 win over Dallas in 
Game 4 of the Stanley Cup finals Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Buffalo Sabres will never forget the speech, because it  
helped them win the biggest game of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys go and score goals,'' Hasek told his defense-minded  
team through the press on Monday. ``Don't worry about me. I'll take 
care of the net.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time defending league MVP made one thing clear: ``Be  
aggressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That meant reversing a disturbing trend for Buffalo. Since  
winning Game 1 in Dallas, the Sabres slipped to the point where 
another inch would have dropped them in Lake Erie. 
</P>
<P>
	They were outshot 29-12 in a 2-1 home loss in Game 3, their  
second straight loss. Hasek had faced plenty of rubber before, 
particularly as the Sabres slid from first place in the Eastern 
Conference to the No. 7 seed for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't mind seeing a lot of pucks; he just wanted to see a  
few go the other way. 
</P>
<P>
	He made his words stand up Tuesday with 30 saves, including 13  
in the third period to preserve the 2-1 lead the opportunistic 
Sabres built on Dallas mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about his comments after the game, Hasek downplayed them  
as coolly as he disposed of the Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just try to do my job,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hasek acknowledged his teammates' improvement. ``They were  
forechecking better, skating better, trying to stop the puck with 
their bodies,'' said Hasek, who won a gold medal for the Czech 
Republic in 1998. ``It helps me emotionally. It pumps me up and 
helps me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres sometimes forget that Hasek needs help. This time  
they were glad to respond to his 9-1-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you have your superstar step up and make himself  
noticed, guys love to see that,'' Sabres captain Michael Peca said. 
``We wanted to approach this like a Game 7, and we certainly came 
out with that kind of effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars appeared to be in denial.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Hasek was the factor in the game,'' said Dallas  
coach Ken Hitchcock, whose team coughed up both goals on defensive 
lapses and whose goalie, Ed Belfour, made some brilliant saves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hasek was good and made some great saves,'' Hitchcock said.  
``But so did Eddie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care if I'm a factor or not,'' Hasek said. ``All I  
want is the win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek played behind Belfour for two seasons in Chicago from  
1990-92, splitting time between the Blackhawks and their minor 
league affiliate in Indianapolis. He credits Belfour for teaching 
him, perhaps too well. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek's play didn't stop the Stars, according to Dallas  
defenseman Darryl Sydor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not affecting us,'' Sydor said. ``We had two or three  
opportunities where it was just us or him and we didn't bury our 
chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Something generated confidence for the Sabres. ``After tonight,  
we know we can play against this team,'' Hasek said.

<HEADLINE> Motorola Moves To Beef Up Its Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOYNTON BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A quick glance around Iain Morris'  
office in this sprawling Motorola Inc. complex gives a sense of 
everything that's gone right -- and wrong -- for the electronics 
giant over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris' desk holds a gadget lover's dream: a pager, world's  
smallest cellular phone, personal electronic organizer and 
satellite phone. It's a wide array of expensive products from a 
name that for years had been synonymous with cutting-edge 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	But those very devices also serve as examples of a staid,  
behind-the-times Motorola, a company too focused on making products 
instead of making customers happy. A company that last year slashed 
17,000 jobs, underwent a billion-dollar restructuring and saw its 
title as the world's largest cellular phone maker lost to upstart 
Nokia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a painful year, but our company is going through a  
rebirth,'' said Morris, who oversees personal communications 
services in the Americas. ``We've reoriented to the future and 
recognized that our business has changed and that we have to change 
with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But critics say the pager on his desk serves a lot less purpose  
in today's world where new digital cellular phones have combined 
the task. The phone is indeed small but does not duplicate the 
Web-accessible features some competitors already market. (Motorola 
has other models that incorporate the feature.) 
</P>
<P>
	And Morris' personal electronic organizer was given a name --  
PageWriter 2000 -- that belies its many functions, including 
downloading information off the Internet. Finally, the Iridium 
satellite phone, which works from anywhere in the world, looks like 
a bulky throwback to the early cellular phone days when the idea of 
a device small enough to fit in a palm seemed preposterous. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris argues that each device still serves a purpose -- albeit  
different than what many company executives had thought. 
</P>
<P>
	``The consumer wants some very fundamental stuff: ease of use,''  
Morris said. ``At the end of the day, my mother could care less 
whether she's getting a digital widget or an analog do-dad. All 
that matters is that they get something that's meaningful to them. 
And what matters to us is how do you provide people the kind of 
thing they want?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola Chief Executive Christopher Galvin in a recent  
interview summed up the company's widely followed problems with a 
startlingly candid revelation: The equipment maker had become too 
busy making stuff and not given much thought about how to market 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1974, we moved away from the consumer and into industrial  
marketing,'' he admitted, ``but since that time it's increasingly 
developed into a consumer business where they want not only new 
products but solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	``To some degree, it's back to the future, where we need to  
focus on the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galvin, speaking in a hotel suite near the annual meeting,  
appears more relaxed today than a year ago, when many wondered 
whether he would survive the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaning forward on a comfortable couch, his outstretched hands  
taking an imaginary grip on the problems of a company founded by 
his grandfather, Galvin said it's now all about ``Team Motorola.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No more ``warring tribes'' of virtually autonomous divisions  
trying to outperform each other while working on their own research 
and development. That led in part to a decision to hold back on 
devoting more resources to digital technology while Americans were 
quickly embracing it. 
</P>
<P>
	No more working separately to convince customers of the benefits  
of products that the company failed to note might have cross-uses. 
</P>
<P>
	No more edicts from on high without discussion.  
</P>
<P>
	Galvin each week sends out about 100,000 e-mails to workers and  
managers, exhorting workers in a style reminiscent of ``Win one for 
the Gipper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While that's rankled some employees -- one of whom recently asked  
sarcastically ``Isn't that what we've been doing?'' -- many 
privately say that this new atmosphere of discussion has fostered 
openness and a better workplace during trying times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's doing a good job of keeping us informed and on  
track to meeting goals without stepping all over each other,'' said 
one longtime employee at the company's Schaumburg headquarters, who 
spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street also has taken notice of the changes. Twenty-five  
out of 33 analysts who follow the company recently recommended 
buying the stock, which this week posted a 52-week high of $90.75 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	``Motorola is no fly-by-night company. When the stock was at $39  
(a share), there wasn't anybody I didn't tell `You're crazy if you 
don't buy it,''' said analyst Phillip Redman at Boston-based Yankee 
Group. ``Overall, they're showing tremendous improvements, but 
there's still a lot of work that needs to be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The moves to win customers by offering an array of products and  
services, and the beginnings of a recovery in the important Asian 
sector, helped Motorola exceed first-quarter earnings expectations. 
For the three months ended April 3, operating income rose to $171 
million compared with $142 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the quarter rose 5 percent to $7.2 billion from $6.9  
billion a year earlier. The long-awaited release of additional 
models of digital wireless telephones, including the popular 
StarTac model, helped boost digital sales to 80 percent of all its 
cellular phones -- a significant increase since analog sales had 
been falling sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of computer chips rose 4 percent to $1.9 billion and  
orders increased 11 percent. A sharp decline in chip sales, which 
make up about 25 percent of profits, last year contributed to the 
company's troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also recently launched a multimillion-dollar  
branding campaign called ``Digital DNA'' that aims to spread the 
word that its electronic components are in everything from cars to 
appliances. It hopes to make the hidden aspect of its work as well 
known as Intel Corp. chips. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola also has moved to answer criticism that it's gotten too  
big to be manageable by consolidating operations and shedding 
slower-growth companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, analyst Redman said a bright company future isn't sealed  
just yet. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted Motorola's cellular infrastructure group continues to  
lose major contracts to competitors amid quality concerns. And its 
$750 million investment in the Teledesic low-satellite consortium 
designed to carry Internet data has been mired in delays. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also has suffered a black eye from its 18 percent  
stake in the $5 billion Iridium global wireless communications 
project that has been beset by troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola recently stood behind the resignation of Iridium's top  
managers. It has written off its $400 million equity stake in 
Iridium and has guaranteed $750 million in bank debt. It also 
agreed to provide hundreds of millions more dollars to finance 
handsets and pay vendors. 
</P>
<P>
	While the $2,000 Iridium handsets got generally good praise from  
journalists using them in Kosovo, a Wall Street Journal article 
detailed some drawbacks. And shareholders at the annual meeting 
devoted much of their questioning to the Iridium issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Iridium, which had been expected to turn a profit upon reaching  
its 500,000th subscriber, now will not be profitable until it gets 
1 million customers, company executives say. 
</P>
<P>
	It may not get anywhere near that goal. The company has less  
than a month to reach targets of 27,000 subscribers, and has fewer 
than 11,000 on board. 
</P>
<P>
	``To see how Motorola's tides will flow depends on how well  
investments in those types of companies do,'' Redman said.

<HEADLINE> Homes Sinking in Philadelphia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Roseanne Allen was just a visitor, but even  
she knew that something was wrong with some of the rowhouses that 
lined her son's block on Hegerman Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was cooking an egg in the frying pan, and it slid out and  
fell on the kitchen floor,'' Allen said of a recent visit to her 
son David's home. ``I couldn't believe my eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reports of sliding eggs and floors so slanted that the doors  
stuck were nothing new to residents on Hegerman, who for years had 
complained of construction problems in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, they finally got an explanation to what was happening  
when city officials notified residents of seven homes that their 
houses were sinking and ordered an immediate evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities planned to demolish the homes today, without  
promising any financial help for the displaced residents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I lived in that house 38 years and raised four kids in there,  
and every time they raised my taxes I paid them,'' said Richard 
Durr, who stopped by Tuesday to get what will likely be a last look 
at his house. ``Now they tell us we're out of luck? It's inhuman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The homes were built in the 1920s on old creek beds filled with  
a 21-foot layer of ash and cinders. Residents complained for years 
about crooked floors and windows. The city buttressed several of 
the homes, then determined two months ago that the problem had 
worsened. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the city ordered homes evacuated Friday,  
city-leased moving vans were rumbling down the narrow street and 
crews hurriedly loaded belongings from the small, meticulously 
maintained rowhouses. People scrambled to pack; many cleaned and 
swept out their homes before closing the doors forever. Some 
residents went to stay with relatives; others stayed in hotel 
suites paid for by the city. 
</P>
<P>
	City and state officials are inspecting the site to determine  
whether sewer work done by the city in 1996 worsened the problem. 
That possibility was raised this week after a resident produced a 
videotape he shot that shows stream water flowing through a 30-foot 
trench dug by the crews. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the city has in any way been involved in this, we'll step  
up. If not, we'll look for federal and state aid,'' Mayor Edward G. 
Rendell has said. ``There are sinking houses in a lot of areas of 
the city and in every case ... the city cannot go out and buy 
people a new house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rendell initially said the city would not reimburse residents  
for their homes because the neighborhood was built before the city 
regulated home construction. Residents say their homeowners 
insurance policies will not cover the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials would not give cost estimates, which will depend on  
how many houses are ultimately affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspectors also are looking over five more homes on Devereaux  
Avenue -- built over an old creek bed -- to determine whether they, 
too, must be evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, my house is already condemned -- I won't be able  
to sell it now. I'm a working-class stiff. What am I supposed to 
do?'' said Joseph McDowell, a 22-year resident of the block. ``I'll 
end up paying a mortgage on a hole in the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Building houses over stream beds and flood plains was standard  
practice during the early part of the century in Philadelphia and 
across the country, said Anne Whiston Spirn, professor of landscape 
architecture and co-director of urban studies at the University of 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether such homes will eventually cave in depends on the type  
of fill and the construction of the foundations, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia has seen the problem before. In 1987, the city paid  
about $20 million to bail out homeowners in the city's Logan 
section after about 1,000 homes were found to be sinking. 
Underground streams had eroded the ash landfill under the 
80-year-old homes.

<HEADLINE> No Charges for Indiana's Knight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Authorities refused to file charges  
against Bob Knight for a restaurant confrontation -- and he still 
had harsh words for the prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana basketball coach had been accused of making a racist  
remark and choking a customer in a parking lot last week, but the 
prosecutor said Knight appeared to have been provoked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the facts I have, including the medical records, my  
decision is not to file charges against Mr. Knight or Mr. Foster,'' 
Carl Salzmann said at a news conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	At his own news conference an hour later, Knight criticized  
Salzmann for letting the case drag on nine days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the prosecutor if the Monroe County prosecutor's office  
investigated Charles Manson, it still would be undecided,'' Knight 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Foster, a 38-year-old Bloomington guitar-maker, had  
accused Knight of making a racist remark while the two dined 
separately at a restaurant in nearby Ellettsville on June 7. He 
said the coach started screaming at him and grabbed him by the neck 
when the two went outside afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Salzmann, however, said the evidence did not support Foster's  
story. Knight said had consulted other law enforcement officials 
about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without exception, these things are either immediately thrown  
out or resolved in two days. ... I'd like to refer to this whole 
thing as a real Mickey Mouse operation, but that would be an insult 
to Mickey Mouse,'' the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, whose temper is notorious in college basketball, said he  
did not consider himself a victim -- ``a target maybe.'' He said his 
wife and her two sisters, who were with him at the restaurant, were 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight's wife, Karen, also spoke at the news conference and  
supported her husband's story. 
</P>
<P>
	``Karen has been unbelievably good for me,'' Knight said. ``But  
the other night, Monday night, after the second postponement (of a 
decision by the prosecutor) she said, 'You know, if you're ready to 
quit, I'm ready to go.' I've never heard anything like that from 
her before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knight gave no indication during the news conference he ever  
considered resigning. He left without taking questions. 
</P>
<P>
	State police Sgt. J.D. Maxwell spoke at Knight's news conference  
and said witnesses confirmed no profanity or racial slurs coming 
from Knight's table. He said they heard Knight talking about the 
old Negro baseball leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conversation was not racist. He said those players were  
cheated by not going into the league white players were in. The 
main thing is, without a doubt, there was no profanity, no racial 
slurs. As sure as there's a God in heaven, I know Bob Knight is not 
a racist,'' Maxwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Salzmann said Foster, who is white, initiated the confrontation  
and his actions are in the ``realm of provocation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salzmann said he would not charge Foster because of the matter  
is relatively minor. He said Foster was not choked, although Knight 
apparently grabbed him by the collar. 
</P>
<P>
	``The location of the injury, the report from emergency medical  
personnel at the hospital, the fact there was no opposing 
thumbprint ... given the totality of circumstances, this office 
will not be filing charges,'' Salzmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another restaurant witness, whom the prosecutor did not  
identify, said Knight was not overly loud, was not cursing and 
``certainly wasn't racist,'' Salzmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster gave a statement to police earlier Wednesday, but his  
dinner companion, Joseph Rheinhardt, refused to give one, Salzmann 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster's lawyer, Kevin McGoff, said his client was relieved not  
to be charged. McGoff said his client did not agree with the 
characterization that he provoked Knight. Foster scheduled a news 
conference Thursday in Indianapolis.

<HEADLINE> Players Love Pinehurst Course  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- In his prime, Jack Nicklaus loved to hear  
his fellow players complain about the narrow fairways and deep 
rough at the U.S. Open. For each complainer, Nicklaus mentally 
checked off one more potential challenger. 
</P>
<P>
	At the lovefest that is the Open at Pinehurst, Nicklaus can't  
count anyone out. 
</P>
<P>
	The first Open to be played at the venerable Pinehurst No. 2 has  
drawn nothing but raves from players who not only love the Donald 
Ross design, but are excited that Open officials did little to 
trick it up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of all the U.S. Opens I've ever played, this course is 100  
percent better than anything else I played,'' said Greg Norman, who 
has played 16 Opens. 
</P>
<P>
	Rough so low players can find -- and actually advance -- their  
balls, and a traditional course winding through the towering North 
Carolina pines have delighted players who feared the United States 
Golf Association would make the conditions too severe. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the treacherous slopes that force balls not hit in exactly  
the right place off the greens haven't drawn criticism from players 
respectful of the role Ross had in designing them 92 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got that many fellows that are happy with the golf  
course, there must be something wrong,'' Nicklaus said. ``But I 
enjoy it too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The relative lack of rough and rain that threatens to fall much  
of the week figure to combine for some low scores in the first few 
rounds, until the greens dry out and the USGA retaliates with pin 
positions put on precarious slopes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what is going to happen Thursday is one of this field  
is going to play very well and score very well,'' Colin Montgomerie 
said. ``One of these players is going to have a very good day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether a player has enough good days to threaten the Open  
record of 8-under held by Nicklaus and Lee Janzen is doubtful. But 
it is clear this Open will be different than many that preceded it. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of hacking balls out of the rough back onto fairways,  
players will be able to shoot for the greens. The problem won't be 
getting to the green, but figuring out how to keep the ball on the 
putting surface. 
</P>
<P>
	``The golf course from tee to green is very simple,'' Tiger  
Woods said. ``It's around the green where it becomes complicated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players have spent much of their practice time dropping balls in  
various areas around the greens, trying to figure out how to chip 
or putt the ball onto a missed green. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods was practicing his little 3-wood chip from just off the  
green, while other players were experimenting with anything from a 
3-iron to a sand wedge to a putter on the shaved surfaces 
surrounding the greens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think these are more difficult greens than Augusta's, the  
way they've got it done,'' Nicklaus said. ``These are the smallest 
playing large greens I've ever seen. There's really not much out 
there to play to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The comparisons to Augusta National haven't been lost on the  
players, who see similarities between the toughness of the greens 
on the two courses. 
</P>
<P>
	Toughness aside, though, the only common factor the two courses  
have is that it will take someone with a very special short game to 
win on each. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any course like this,'' Montgomerie  
said. ``There's the odd upturned saucer green on golf courses, and 
there might be even a third, even six of them. But not 18 of 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Light rain fell most of the day Tuesday, softening the greens a  
bit and allowing players to aim directly at more pins. 
</P>
<P>
	But the practice pairing of Nicklaus, Larry Mize, Fred Funk and  
Billy Mayfair found out quickly that firing at the pins is not the 
smartest thing to do at Pinehurst. 
</P>
<P>
	On the par-4 second hole, only Nicklaus managed to hit the ball  
on the green, and only because he landed it 20 feet short out of 
the rough and it ran on. The other three players all hit in the 
middle of the green, only to watch their balls roll off the back of 
the green into a collection area. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any player who thinks he can fly the ball all the way to the  
pin is going to have 20 to 25 feet coming back,'' course 
superintendent Paul Jett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman made his first trip around the course quickly, playing by  
himself and playing through a group that included Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't need to linger to know what he liked, though.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am absolutely in love with this golf course,'' Norman said.  
``It's truly magnificent. Preparation wise, there's not one bad 
hole out there.''

<HEADLINE> Republicans Criticizing Gore on Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Using Al Gore's presidential announcement  
speech against him, Republicans accused the vice president today of 
``flip-flopping'' on gun control and other issues during his 22 
years in public office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Level with America, Mr. Vice President,'' Republican National  
Committee Jim Nicholson said Wednesday in a full page ad in several 
newspapers, including The Des Moines Register and USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson said Democratic presidential front-runner has tailored  
his ``convictions to fit the fashions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The RNC distributed research that it said showed inconsistencies  
in Gore's record, citing his votes on gun control while in Congress 
and his speech formally announcing his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``While some want to pass new protections for gun manufacturers,  
to shield them from lawsuits, I will work to get guns off the 
streets, out of the schools, and away from children and 
criminals,'' the vice president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans countered that Gore, as a member of Congress, voted:  
</P>
<P>
	--Against a 14-day waiting period for handgun purchases in 1985  
but then in favor of a seven-day waiting period in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	--Against gun dealer licensing and inspection requirements in  
1985. 
</P>
<P>
	--Against requiring serial numbers on all handguns manufactured  
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	--Against retaining the ban on the interstate sale of handguns in  
1985. 
</P>
<P>
	The RNC also accused him of flip-flopping on a semiautomatic  
weapons ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the vice president has been very consistent on all  
these issues,'' responded Gore's spokesman Roger Salazar. ``It's a 
shame the Republicans can't offer any positive visions but can only 
attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential  
front-runner, has been criticized for failing to clearly articulate 
his stand on gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has no immediate response to Gore's announcement speech.  
</P>
<P>
	But Elizabeth Dole said she welcomed Gore to the campaign -- but  
questioned assertions his references to ``moral authority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Where was Al Gore when his partner, Bill Clinton, robbed the  
Oval Office of its moral authority?'' Dole said. ``I think the time 
has come for the sun to set on the Clinton-Gore Administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Nashville, Gary Bauer said Al Gore was right to stress the  
``crisis in the American family.'' But he said Clinton 
administration policies have robbed Gore of his credibility on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that it doesn't pass the straight-face test for the  
vice president to start talking about faith-based solutions and 
family values when all of the judges he and the president have put 
on the court have been very radical,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes said he and Gore do not agree on many policy  
questions, but that dichotomy will be a welcome change in the 
campaign. He wants to debate Gore on issues from social security to 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that his fundamentally different views are going to  
make the campaign about something more than personalities,'' Forbes 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning in Iowa, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander said  
his education policies differ greatly from those outlined by Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Al Gore wants a national school board,'' he said. ``I want a  
local school board.''

<HEADLINE> Republicans Mock Gore in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans went to great lengths to divert  
attention from Vice President Al Gore's presidential candidacy 
announcement today -- they even hired a team of mules to pull their 
chairman around downtown Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson arrived  
today at Gore's childhood home -- a luxurious downtown Washington 
hotel -- by mule-driven cart. He led reporters on a tour of the 
three suites where Gore spent his youth while his father was in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The mule routine was a response to comments Gore made in March  
about spending youthful summers plowing fields on his family's farm 
in Carthage, Tenn. Gore announced his candidacy in Carthage today. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans noted that most of Gore's youth was spent living in  
the former Ritz-Carlton in Washington, not plowing hillsides in 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Al Gore is not Daniel Boone,'' Nicholson said. ``He is the  
'barefoot boy of Embassy Row','' referring to the stretch of large 
houses along Washington's Massachusetts Avenue where the hotel is 
located. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson denied that the stunt, which included an actor dressed  
as a farmer reading Gore quotes, was mean-spirited. ``It's not 
intended to be. It is intended to be educational and to have fun,'' 
he said. ``There is no intention for a lack of decorum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is one ironic twist in the hotel's political history. Over  
the years, Nicholson said, it has served as home to many prominent 
politicians, including the grandfather of the leading Republican 
presidential contender, Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's grandfather, a senator from Connecticut, kept a suite of  
rooms for his family to live in while he was in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson also attacked Gore in an open letter Tuesday  
criticizing the vice president's policy positions on issues from 
the environment to abortion. The letter, entitled ``Level with 
America, Mr. Vice President,'' ran as a full page ad in several 
newspapers, including The Des Moines Register and USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson used the letter to ``welcome'' the vice president to  
the presidential trail. 
</P>
<P>
	``The months ahead offer you a chance to finally explain  
yourself, to finally level with the American people,'' Nicholson 
wrote in the letter. ``We hope you'll meet that challenge.''

<HEADLINE> Injured Crew Chief Begins Therapy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A pit crew member injured in a crash at last  
month's Indianapolis 500 is starting a physical therapy program 
after being released from the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Fried, the chief mechanic for rookie driver Robby McGehee,  
was released Sunday, two weeks after the accident, and remains in 
Indianapolis for rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mentor, Ohio, crewman was working in McGehee's pit early in  
the race when he was struck from behind by Jimmy Kite's car, which 
had been hit by another car whose brakes had failed. Fried landed 
on his face and suffered head and chest injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of McGehee's team have talked with him over the phone  
and called his recovery miraculous. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have seen him lying there on pit lane only two weeks ago,  
and knowing how bad it was hurt, it is unbelievable to me that he 
has been released,'' Energizer Motorsports team leader David Conti 
said in a news release. ``We all knew Steve was a fighter, but this 
is really incredible.''

<P>
	McGehee agreed.

<HEADLINE> Coke's Belgian Ban May Soon End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The Belgium government will decide  
Thursday whether to lift its ban on Coca-Cola soft drinks, while 
safety fears lingered in several European countries following the 
hospitalization of dozens of Belgians who drank the company's 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	Spain on Wednesday joined Belgium, France, Luxembourg and the  
Netherlands in restricting or banning Coke drinks after Coke 
admitted Tuesday to production problems at two of its plants which 
serve Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past several weeks, several dozen Belgian youngsters  
who drank Coke products have been hospitalized with vomiting, 
stomach pains and nausea. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke chairman M. Douglas Ivester, in his first public statement  
since the contamination scare hit, sought to reassure Coke's 
customers that it is ``taking all necessary steps to ensure that 
all our products meet the highest quality standards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We deeply regret any problems encountered by our European  
customers in the past few days,'' Ivester said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke has maintained that despite the hospitalizations, tests  
showed the problems at the two factories didn't cause any health 
dangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Still some Belgians started swearing off Coke drinks Wednesday  
and analysts warned the company could face a consumer backlash, 
just as its sales in Europe have been crimped by stagnant 
economies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've stopped drinking it, and I don't think I will start  
again,'' said Natalie Sinnodt, 23, a social worker. ``I should have 
stopped anyway for diet reasons, this makes it easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't touch it,'' added Chau Line, 27, a secretary.  
</P>
<P>
	The Spanish government Wednesday froze a shipment of 8,000  
bottles of Belgian-produced Coke and other Coca-Cola brands in the 
northern province of Zamora. The Health Ministry insisted the move 
was strictly precautionary. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgium banned all Coke products on Monday and Luxembourg  
followed with a similar ban on Tuesday including Fanta, Sprite, 
Aquarius, Bonaqua and Minute Maid fruit juices. The French 
government ordered the withdrawal of all canned Coke products, 50 
million cans. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, Coke's Dutch arm -- at the request of the  
government -- recalled all its products originating from Belgium and 
ordered its distributors in the Netherlands to stop any imports of 
Coca-Cola products from Belgian suppliers. In Germany, Coke also 
recalled products originating from Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belgian government said Health Minister Luc Van den Bossche  
will decide Thursday whether to lift or extend the ban. The 
decision will be made on the basis of scientific tests conducted on 
samples from the production plants where the problems occurred in 
Antwerp and Dunkirk, France, said a government statement. Belgian's 
government is keen to show it's taking tough action to protect 
consumers who are still reeling from a recent scandal over meat, 
eggs and dairy products infected with cancer-causing dioxins that 
led to international bans on Belgian food. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's mishandling of dioxin scare was a major factor  
in the ruling center-left parties taking a battering in national 
elections Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke has acknowledged that the Antwerp plant used substandard  
gas to put bubbles into drinks which caused an ``off taste.'' In a 
second incident, the outside bottom of cans absorbed pesticide used 
on wooden crates giving of an ``offensive odor'' the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke reassured that the problems were confined to the Belgian  
market and ``do not relate to products produced in other parts of 
the world.'' Coca-Cola France set up an emergency hotline for 
worried consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke's actions seemed to convince European Union authorities.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have the impression that Coca-Cola has taken the situation  
in hand ... has taken measures to resolve the problem as quickly as 
possible,'' said Pietro Petrucci, consumer affairs spokesman for 
the EU's executive body, the European Commission. ``I see a rapid 
solution, because the situation is rather clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, analysts and retail groups warned Coke could face a  
consumer backlash. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vendors we've talked to said that consumers are beginning to  
express deep concerns,'' said Guy Francheteau, an agro-food analyst 
at the brokerage house Pinatton in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	He compared the case to the scare over Perrier mineral water in  
1990, when traces of Benzene were found in some of its bottles on 
the U.S. market. That scare was believed to have cost the French 
company $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippe Lenfant, the general manager of Coca-Cola Belgium, said  
Tuesday the company has not yet calculated the amount of money it 
stands to lose from the European bans. Coke estimates 26 percent of 
its $18.8 billion sales are in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Manage Your Taxes, Add to Income / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- You are causing yourself grave financial damage  
if you allow the Internal Revenue Service to overwithhold taxes 
from your income, says Dan Pilla. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilla can demonstrate this. To begin, you receive no interest  
from Uncle Sam; why, the amount of the refund check you receive is 
actually worth less in buying power than the amount withheld. 
</P>
<P>
	But far, far more important is what you could have done with  
that money had you held onto it rather than send it to Washington. 
Such as doubling or tripling it just by using common sense. 
</P>
<P>
	That sense seems sadly lacking. Last year, more than 83 million  
tax refunds, averaging more than $1,600, were issued by the IRS. 
This year, refunds may reach 90 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilla, a tax litigation consultant to taxpayers, lawyers,  
accountants and members of Congress, shows how it can be done in 
his book, ``How To Double Your Tax Refund.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From experience, he knows that many who allow overwithholding  
can ill afford to do so. Why not, he advises, stop the practice and 
pay down credit card debt instead, earning in effect 18 percent? 
</P>
<P>
	Or pay down the home mortgage bill and really score? Such as by  
ending overwithholding and investing $130 a month in reducing your 
home mortgage? That investment could return $8,321 to you. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifics: $130 a month or $1,570 a year approximated the  
average refund last year. Assume the mortgage involved is for 
$100,000 at 8 percent for 30 years, and is already five years old. 
</P>
<P>
	By adding $130 to each of 12 monthly payments during the year  
the mortgage-payer will save $8,231 over the span of the mortgage, 
knocking one full year off the term of the note. 
</P>
<P>
	Assume further that the mortgage-payer continues to pay $130  
each and every month until the entire debt is paid off. The 30-year 
mortgage is thus repaid in 22 years. Net saving: $49,974. 
</P>
<P>
	The irony is that a very large percentage of people allow their  
paychecks to be overwithheld as a form of forced saving, fooling 
themselves and maybe committing their families to constant stress. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibilities mentioned are just the beginning. Pilla shows  
how variations in the use of that measly $130 a month can do 
wonders in a 401 (k) plan, or in an insurance policy or a brokerage 
account. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the money returned to the taxpayer is reduced by having  
remained in an IRS account paying no interest while the value of 
those withheld dollars is reduced by inflation, however slight. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, a new problem could arise if IRS computers fail to  
meet the Year 2000 challenge. The Government Accounting office this 
year expressed concern that taxpayer refunds could be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Pilla and other critics contend that the thrust of  
IRS promotional efforts to individuals and businesses encourage 
overwithholding. The decision, however, remains with the taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
	You have the right to adjust your withholding statement, Form  
W-4, on a regular basis by informing your employer. The book tells 
you how to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	But do your homework: Beware of having too little withheld and  
then owing money on April 15. The IRS is acutely aware of how 
penalties and interest can run up the bill.

<HEADLINE> Fraud Lawsuit Filed Against Sears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDWARDSVILLE, Ill. (AP) -- Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. collected up to  
$400 million for tire balancing services it never performed, then 
paid millions to keep the fraud quiet, according to a lawsuit filed 
in Madison County Circuit Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Tuesday, also claims managers destroyed the  
tire-balancing machines with sledgehammers to cover up the fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint, which seeks class-action status, estimates 7  
million to 30 million people who purchased Sears AccuBalance 
service from 1989 to 1994 were potentially defrauded. 
</P>
<P>
	The balancing machines were used to shave off a tiny layer of  
rubber to make sure the tires were round. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears workers typically charged $12.50 to process each tire but  
often skipped the procedure, which was impossible for the buyer to 
detect, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	It also contends Sears management knew that most of the  
balancing services never were performed, but pressured employees to 
sell the services anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Stephen Katz, who represents the plaintiffs, said he  
believes Sears failed to do the work up to 90 percent of the time 
in its 800 tire stores nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears spokesman David Albritton declined comment today on the  
lawsuit, which he said the company had not seen. 
</P>
<P>
	But he noted the case is the same as a federal lawsuit pending  
in Tampa, Fla. That lawsuit was filed in September 1991, thrown out 
and recently reinstated late last year by a federal appeals court 
that ruled notices Sears sent in 1992 for reimbursement of 
``unnecessary and/or improper repairs'' were too vague to be 
understood. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit accuses Sears of paying almost $30 million in ``hush  
money'' to buy the silence of the machine's manufacturer, Assix 
International Inc., of Tampa, Fla., after that company's workers 
reported significant discrepancies between the services Sears sold 
and the work recorded by mechanical counters on the machines. 
</P>
<P>
	Assix leased about 1,300 machines to Sears for $300 per month  
each, plus a royalty of 15 cents on every tire shaved, according to 
court documents. Sears paid Assix based on cash register receipts 
and not the counters, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Sears paid $30 million in cash and property for a $6  
million contract termination settlement and to acquire the 
AccuBalance machines, the lawsuit contends. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit alleges that Sears, based in the Chicago suburb of  
Hoffman Estates, distributed a ``secret video tape'' telling 
workers to destroy the machines and the counters with 
sledgehammers, then sell the remains for scrap. It claims Sears 
also acquired all Assix paperwork regarding its AccuBalance 
machines as part of ``massive cover-up efforts.''

	bin Laden May Be Planning Attack  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden is in the  
advanced stages of planning another terrorist operation, U.S. 
intelligence has concluded, though the timing and location of the 
strike are unknown. The United States blames bin Laden for ordering 
last year's bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. 
Bin Laden, an exiled Saudi millionaire, has openly declared his 
hostility to the United States for its support of Israel and for 
the presence of U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf region.

they made ``some agreements'' toward resolving a Russian-NATO 
standoff over Moscow's role in keeping peace in Kosovo. Cohen said 
that he and Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev would resume 
their discussions tomorrow. Cohen has ruled out any compromise with 
Russia that would permit Moscow's troops to patrol in Kosovo under 
their own command.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Leaders of ethnic Albanian insurgents in  
Kosovo have reaffirmed a commitment to surrender their heavy 
weapons and to help build democracy in the Serbian province, a 
State Department official said today. But the leaders of the Kosovo 
Liberation Army, which fought a guerrilla war against the Serbs in 
a drive for independence, may not be in control of every rebel unit 
and able to turn over the weapons, James Dobbins said.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House today rejected proposed curbs on  
youth access to explicit sexual or violent material in video games, 
movies and other art and entertainment. The vote was 282-146. 
Lawmakers in both parties had voiced concern that the proposed 
restrictions violated the Constitution's free speech guarantee. In 
response to this spring's high school shootings in Colorado, the 
House approved tougher law enforcement measures against juvenile 
offenders. It faces a politically charged showdown tomorrow over 
gun control.

	CARTHAGE, Tenn. (AP) -- Al Gore promised an all-consuming ``fight

the vice president said. Gore claimed a share of credit for the 
six-year economic recovery under President Clinton, but said the 
work is not complete. With unemployment low and the stock market 
high, parents are still working too hard and spending too much time

	Unabomber Wants Conviction Reviewed

	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Theodore Kaczynski asked an appeals  
court today to review his conviction for the deadly Unabomber 
attacks, saying the judge at his trial was unfair and his lawyers 
wrongly went ahead with a mental illness defense. Kaczynski, who 
pleaded guilty in January 1998 to a string of bombings that killed 
three people and injured 23 others, said his plea was coerced 
partly by defense attorneys and partly by a hostile judge who 
rejected his request to change lawyers. Kaczynski, 57, is serving a

<HEADLINE> 5 Questions: Mary Chapin Carpenter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Leave it to Mary Chapin Carpenter to  
take something as hackneyed as a greatest hits album and make it 
intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
	On the new ``Party Doll and Other Favorites'' album (Columbia),  
Carpenter dipped into the vaults for some surprises. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, ``Can't Take Love for Granted'' is a rocking  
performance from ``The Late Show With David Letterman,'' with 
Letterman's introduction included. ``Down at the Twist &AMP; Shout'' 
comes from Super Bowl XXXI, where Carpenter performed, and is 
superior to the familiar single. 
</P>
<P>
	Title song ``Party Doll'' is a vulnerable tune written by  
well-known sensitive New Age guy Mick Jagger. Another of the 17 
selections is a number from a John Lennon tribute album that's 
become a wedding standard. 
</P>
<P>
	There's even an occasional original version of a greatest hit  
here and there. 
</P>
<P>
	``My manager calls it a box set without the box,'' Carpenter  
said with a laugh. ``I didn't want some generic greatest hits 
package.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carpenter, 41, a native of Princeton, N.J., hit it big in 1991.  
</P>
<P>
	She has crafted breezy hit singles like ``Shut Up and Kiss Me.''  
She has made deeply felt concept albums like ``Stones in the 
Road.'' And she introduced stellar singer-songwriter Lucinda 
Williams to the mainstream via her hit version of Williams' 
``Passionate Kisses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tired at the end of a day of interviews at a Nashville studio,  
Carpenter rallied to promote her new album and tour. 
</P>
<P>
	1. On the ``Party Doll'' album, you follow John Lennon's ``Grow  
Old With Me'' with ``He Thinks He'll Keep Her.'' The first is a 
hymn of marital devotion, and the latter is about a woman getting 
out of a stifling marriage. Was that intended as an editorial 
comment? 
</P>
<P>
	Carpenter: (groans loudly) No, no. Sequencing is the bane of my  
existence! I almost got to the point where I felt like drawing them 
out of a hat. 
</P>
<P>
	2. I understand you resisted the idea of a compilation album.  
Why? 
</P>
<P>
	Carpenter: I kind of resisted at first. A lot of record  
companies put out greatest hits on artists who've had one or two 
records out, and then the next record is a greatest hits album. I 
was confused by that. It seemed to point at some demise of an 
artist or something. I didn't want to have anything to do with it, 
if that's what it meant. ... 
</P>
<P>
	I just thought, there's a way to do this that's not formula. And  
that's when I started rustling through the files and saying, 'What 
have we got here?' 
</P>
<P>
	While I would put certain hits on it to satisfy that part of it,  
why can't I put alternative versions of those songs? I was able to 
do that in most cases, as well as get the rights to put songs on 
there that I'd never been able to put in one place before -- 
soundtracks, benefit albums, outside projects. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what my intent was, and I'm really, really proud of this  
record. 
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Passionate Kisses'' is included on the CD, of course. Do  
you ever feel guilty at having that hit instead of Lucinda 
Williams, who wrote it and is an artist who deserves more 
recognition? 
</P>
<P>
	Carpenter: There's no justice in this world, is there? You know,  
that's how I feel about it. I feel privileged to have been able to 
sing that song and inhabit it. ... 
</P>
<P>
	I certainly think that her profile has grown by leaps and bounds  
and cartwheels, but let's face it -- many more people need to know 
about Lucinda Williams than know about her. I don't know why some 
people get more attention than others. But I would trust that 
Lucinda knows that the people who love her music are completely and 
utterly devoted to what she does. I hope it fills her tank. 
</P>
<P>
	4. If a greatest hits compilation doesn't signal the demise of  
an artist, it should at least signal a new beginning. When will you 
have a new album and where are you going musically? 
</P>
<P>
	Carpenter: (guffaws) I hadn't even thought about that! I sort of  
figure you don't really know until you get there. It takes me, on 
the average historically, 12,000 years to make a record. You know, 
slow and steady. I'm always writing. When it's time to make a new 
record, I guess I will. I don't mean to sound flaky, it's just 
that, right now, all I'm thinking is 'Well, I'm going to go on

<HEADLINE> Oldest Fossil of Beaked Bird Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Paleontologists have found a fossil of the oldest known bird  
species with a beak -- an upturned bill resembling Woody 
Woodpecker's. 
</P>
<P>
	The 130 million-year-old, crow-sized Confuciusornis dui was  
discovered last year in ancient lake sediment in China, so 
exquisitely preserved that impressions of its feathers are clearly 
visible. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, the earliest known toothless, beaked bird dated from  
about 70 million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The skull of the Confuciusornis dui fascinated -- and amused --  
scientists. The beak resembles that of pesky Woody Woodpecker. 
</P>
<P>
	The creature's beak was an advanced trait for its time, coming  
only 10 million to 15 million years after the first known bird -- 
the toothy, reptile-like Archaeopteryx -- during the Jurassic 
Period. The Archaeopteryx had a reptilian snout rather than a beak 
of horn-like material. 
</P>
<P>
	The back end of the Confuciusornis dui's skull is primitive,  
with two openings behind the eyes that are a throwback to 
dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you've got is a modern car engine hood on the rear end of  
a Model T,'' said Larry D. Martin, curator of vertebrate 
paleontology at the University of Kansas' Museum of Natural 
History. He helped analyze the fossil. 
</P>
<P>
	This combination of primitive and advanced traits suggests that  
early bird evolution was more complex than previously thought and 
included many species that didn't succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is showing a diversity we didn't know about before. It's  
not like you have this sort of straight-line evolution from one to 
another and each one getting more specialized,'' said Storrs L. 
Olson, curator of birds at the National Museum of Natural History 
at the Smithsonian Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Sankar Chatterjee, a professor of geology at Texas Tech  
University in Lubbock, agreed: ``The story is much more complex. 
Evolution is not really like a ladder. It's more like a bush.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bird is described in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.  
It was analyzed by American scientists and a team from the Chinese 
Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists believe the bird flew well and took off by scaling  
trees and jumping. 
</P>
<P>
	Confuciusornis (kahn-FYOO-shus-OR-nis) dui is the smallest  
species found to date of the order named for the Chinese 
philosopher. The birds became extinct 120 million years ago and 
probably didn't lead to modern birds. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of specimens of a larger species of Confuciusornis have  
also been found at the site, but all lacked intact skulls. 
Researchers believe the birds fell victim to volcanic eruptions 
that preserved their remains.

<HEADLINE> Lamar Odom Shopping for New Agent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Lamar Odom, a likely early  
pick in the upcoming NBA draft, is looking for a new agent and 
still intends to turn pro, his college coach said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He needs new representation, and I'm the closest thing to a  
father figure that he's had in his life and he needed a hug and to 
let him know that he's OK,'' Rhode Island coach Jerry DeGregorio 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hasn't pulled himself out of the draft. There's a lot of  
speculation out there, but his name is in the draft,'' DeGregorio 
said from his office in Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom's availability in the draft was questioned after he skipped  
a league-wide physical in Chicago last weekend and canceled a 
workout with the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday. Then he turned up 
on Rhode Island's campus Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hornets vice president Bob Bass said he thought Odom wanted to  
return to school, but didn't see how he could after signing an 
agent, which would jeopardize his standing as a college player 
under NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom was represented by New York City attorney Jeff Klein. Stu  
Jackson, president and general manager of the Vancouver Grizzlies -- 
the only team with which Odom has worked out -- said Klein told him 
Wednesday he had resigned as Odom's representative. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lamar is meeting with me to discuss his future plans,''  
DeGregorio said. ``He's in the process of reorganizing his advisory 
team and at this time he is planning to schedule further workouts 
with NBA teams next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Odom, 19, announced in May his availability for the June 30  
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Many scouts feel the 6-foot-9 Odom, who averaged 17.6 points and  
9.4 rebounds last season, will be a top-five pick.

<HEADLINE> DAC Gets Bankruptcy Court Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Downtown Athletic Club in lower Manhattan  
has won a U.S. Bankruptcy Court's approval to sell the hotel 
portion of its 35-story Art Deco building, allowing it to remain 
the home of the Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	The club, where the nation's outstanding collegiate football  
player is named each year, had been in financial jeopardy until 
April, when the U.S. District Court referred the club's 
reorganization plan to the Bankruptcy Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The following week, a $9.85 million payment was made by Cheslock  
Bakker Associates of Stamford, Conn., to mortgage holder 18 West, 
effectively ending the club's 14-month bankruptcy battle. Final 
approval was announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheslock Bakker is buying the hotel facilities for $8 million  
and providing up to $11.5 million to satisfy the Athletic Club's 
remaining creditors and improve its facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Renovation is set to begin in January.  
</P>
<P>
	The terms of the agreement call for DAC to retain floors two  
through 13, including the historic Heisman Room. Cheslock Bakker 
will control floors 14-35; and the two entities will share the 
lobby, where the Heisman is displayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Past winners of the Heisman Trophy have included O.J. Simpson,  
Roger Staubach and Archie Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've fought a long, tough battle and now we can get on with  
restoring the DAC to its position as the preeminent athletic club 
in New York City,'' DAC President William Dockery said in a 
statement Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wishes Gore Good Luck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- From halfway around the world, President Clinton  
today sent a good luck message and offered stump strategy to Al 
Gore in Tennessee as the vice president formally began his White 
House quest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president believes that it's time for the vice president  
to get out and make the case, let the country know who he is, where 
he wants to take the country,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart 
said. ``He takes an important first step on that journey today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart, answering reporters' questions following Clinton's  
speech to the International Labor Organization, said the 
administration's economic, education and environmental policies 
``will prove to be a very successful platform'' for Gore's 
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also wished Gore while good luck in a telephone call  
from a limousine as the president headed to the Geneva airport and 
a flight to Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was beginning his drive for the presidency today with an  
announcement address in his hometown of Carthage, Tenn.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Airport Spending Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Propelled by members complaining of  
overcrowded runways, old equipment and high ticket prices, the 
House has ignored the warnings of its own budget leaders and the 
Clinton administration and backed a big boost in aviation spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 316-110 Tuesday for a Federal Aviation  
Administration spending bill that authorizes $56 billion over five 
years for operating the FAA and improving airport and air traffic 
control facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	House Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa.,  
known for his mastery in directing money to infrastructure 
projects, said he was able to squeeze out an extra $14 billion with 
a provision ensuring that all revenues in the Aviation Trust Fund, 
which comes from airport user taxes, are used exclusively for 
aviation projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust fund, which takes in some $10 billion a year, is part  
of the general federal budget. Because revenues exceed spending on 
aviation projects, the rest goes to other federal programs or to 
padding the budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster last year succeeded in moving a similar highway trust  
fund ``off-budget,'' but the administration warned that President 
Clinton would veto the FAA bill if he tried it again, and budget 
leaders from both parties denounced the move as an attempt to usurp 
their authority to determine government spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must shut this door today and we must slam it shut for  
good,'' said Rep. Tom Delay of Texas, the third-ranked Republican 
in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once this process begins,'' said Appropriations Committee  
Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla., of efforts to build firewalls around 
certain areas of the budget, ``the members of this House lose 
control over the budget process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a Young amendment to remove the provision protecting the  
aviation trust fund was defeated 248-179, as many members rose to 
speak of the need to spend every airport tax dollar to address 
deteriorating facilities and poor service. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., spoke of how businesses are  
leaving her Rochester district because the lack of air service to 
its smaller market has made air travel prohibitively expensive -- 
$1,200 for a roundtrip to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans who fly are not being told that their taxes ``are used  
by bureaucrats in a classic Washington shell game of 
hide-the-budget-deficit,'' said Rep. Bob Filner, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster denied claims that the extra money would eat away at  
funds for Social Security and other federal programs, saying the 
$14 billion could come from GOP plans to cut $778 billion in taxes 
over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is morally wrong to take aviation ticket taxes and use  
those ticket taxes for a general tax cut,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, which has yet to be taken up by the full Senate, also  
allows airports to double facility charges from $3 to $6 for local 
use. It would require the hiring of more air traffic controllers 
and establish procedures to quiet air tours over national parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Incentives are provided to encourage service to and competition  
at smaller market airports. Spending under the Airport Improvement 
Program, which funds new runways and deals with noise pollution, 
would rise from $1.9 billion this year to $4.3 billion in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the more controversial provisions, takeoff and landing  
restrictions would be eliminated at O'Hare in Chicago in 2002 and 
at La Guardia and JFK in New York in 2007. Additional flights to 
underserved airports would also be allowed out of Washington's 
Reagan National Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1000.

<HEADLINE> Dierker Remains in Intensive Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Astros manager Larry Dierker will remain  
in intensive care until at least Thursday before undergoing an 
angiogram to check his progress, general manager Gerry Hunsicker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's just nothing else to add today,'' Hunsicker said  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker had surgery Tuesday to remove two tangled sets of blood  
vessels from the front of his brain. Doctors say the malformations 
caused the grand mal seizure he suffered in the dugout during a 
game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Rob Parrish said Dierker, 52, probably will remain  
hospitalized into next week and faces four weeks of convalescence 
at home, meaning he likely won't return until after the All-Star 
break. 
</P>
<P>
	The angiogram will be performed to make sure surgeons removed  
the entire arteriovenous malformation, the tangle of blood vessels 
that caused the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Bench coach Matt Galante is handling the team in Dierker's  
absence. One of the team's stars, Craig Biggio, has made a pregame 
ritual of hanging Dierker's jersey over his empty seat at the end 
of the dugout.

	Consumer Prices Unchanged in May  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer prices stabilized in May after a  
worrisome jump the month before, easing some inflation jitters but 
failing to quiet speculation over whether the Federal Reserve will 
raise short-term interest rates. Falling energy prices balanced 
rising food costs to help keep the Consumer Price Index flat last 
month, the Labor Department reported today. So far this year, the 
annual rate of inflation felt by consumers is 2.6 percent, compared 
with a 1.6 percent rise for all of 1998, the smallest in a dozen 
years. Core prices rose 0.1 percent as clothing and auto prices 
declined and medical and housing costs edged up.

released by the Fed today, found consumers are continuing a buying 
spree, manufacturing is recovering from a slump in demand overseas 
and prices generally remain ``well-behaved.'' But with unemployment 
at a 29-year low, labor markets remain tight and more regions are 
reporting wage pressures that can eventually lead to inflation.

Although the bill had 77 co-sponsors, Sen. Phil Gramm objected to

Instead, it directs future negotiators to come up with unspecified

<HEADLINE>  US Asks Pakistan To Withdraw Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- President Clinton has urged Pakistan  
to withdraw guerrilla forces fighting the Indian army on the Indian 
side of the disputed Himalayan state of Kashmir, even though 
Pakistan denies controlling the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 20-minute telephone conversation with Prime Minister Nawaz  
Sharif on Tuesday, Clinton called on Pakistan to withdraw its 
troops across the line of control that separates Kashmir between 
the unfriendly neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, he made a similar call to Indian Prime Minister  
Atal Bihari Vajpayee, urging him to return to the peace process 
begun earlier this year with Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's call to Pakistan appeared to be a departure from his  
usual neutrality and the U.S. position that both parties show 
restraint and resume talks. 
</P>
<P>
	While Pakistan says the Muslim insurgents battling Indian  
soldiers in Kashmir are ``freedom fighters,'' India says they are 
Pakistani soldiers and mercenaries disguised as Kashmiri militants. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton urged Sharif to continue talks with his Indian  
counterpart, but warned that until Pakistan withdraws troops from 
Indian-held Kashmir it was difficult to see how tensions could be 
reduced, said P.J. Crowley, a spokesman for the U.S. National 
Security Council in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president said he did not see how progress could be made  
on this issue until (Pakistani) forces are withdrawn back across 
the line of control,'' Crowley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pakistani army has denied that its soldiers are in  
Indian-held Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Americans are unaware of the ground situation. We are  
within our side of the border,'' said Brig. Rashid Quereshi, an 
army spokesman.

<HEADLINE>  US Asks Pakistan To Withdraw Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- President Clinton has urged Pakistan  
to withdraw guerrilla forces fighting the Indian army on the Indian 
side of the disputed Himalayan state of Kashmir, even though 
Pakistan denies controlling the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 20-minute telephone conversation with Prime Minister Nawaz  
Sharif on Tuesday, Clinton called on Pakistan to withdraw its 
troops across the line of control that separates Kashmir between 
the unfriendly neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, he made a similar call to Indian Prime Minister  
Atal Bihari Vajpayee, urging him to return to the peace process 
begun earlier this year with Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's call to Pakistan appeared to be a departure from his  
usual neutrality and the U.S. position that both parties show 
restraint and resume talks. 
</P>
<P>
	While Pakistan says the Muslim insurgents battling Indian  
soldiers in Kashmir are ``freedom fighters,'' India says they are 
Pakistani soldiers and mercenaries disguised as Kashmiri militants. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton urged Sharif to continue talks with his Indian  
counterpart, but warned that until Pakistan withdraws troops from 
Indian-held Kashmir it was difficult to see how tensions could be 
reduced, said P.J. Crowley, a spokesman for the U.S. National 
Security Council in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president said he did not see how progress could be made  
on this issue until (Pakistani) forces are withdrawn back across 
the line of control,'' Crowley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pakistani army has denied that its soldiers are in  
Indian-held Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Americans are unaware of the ground situation. We are  
within our side of the border,'' said Brig. Rashid Quereshi, an 
army spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Militants headquartered in Pakistan say they won't withdraw.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have not gone to Indian-occupied Kashmir on the directives

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House this evening rejected proposed curbs  
on youth access to explicit sexual or violent material in 
videogames, movies and other art and entertainment. The vote was 
282-146 and came after lawmakers in both parties expressed concern 
that the proposed restrictions violated the Constitution's free 
speech guarantee. At the same time, in response to this spring's 
high school shootings in Colorado, the House approved tougher law 
enforcement measures against juvenile offenders, and girded for a

	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen and his  
Russian counterpart made ``very significant progress'' Wednesday 
toward an agreement to include Russian troops in NATO-led 
peacekeeping in Kosovo, a U.S. official said. After hours of talks 
that stretched into the night, Cohen said the meeting would resume 
Thursday with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Russia's 
foreign minister on hand. Cohen has ruled out any compromise with 
Russia that would permit Moscow's troops to patrol in Kosovo under

workers that Kosovo wasn't safe enough yet. Roads were clogged 
across much of southern Kosovo -- and 12 miles back into Albania. 
The Yugoslav army pulled its last troops out of the Kosovo capital 
of Pristina, and panicked Serb civilians bought and fought their

<HEADLINE> Gettysburg Offers Civil War Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GETTYSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Gettysburg College shares more than a  
name with the Civil War's most famous battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Administrators at the 167-year-old school work inside a  
white-columned landmark that doubled as a hospital when war came to 
campus. In early skirmishing, Union troops fled across the main 
quad. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet students can spend four years here and learn not much more  
about the war than they could at any other American university. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting this fall, Gettysburg College is finally making sure  
its undergraduates can take full advantage of the school's 
front-row seat for history: The school is launching a minor in 
Civil War-era studies. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first in the country and a first for the 2,200-student  
college, too, which begs a question: What took so long? 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know,'' said Bob Winans, interdepartmental studies  
chairman at Gettysburg. ``Doing a program on the Civil War at 
Gettysburg seemed eminently logical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The college has had a Civil War historian for years, Gabor  
Boritt, who runs the Civil War Institute and teaches several 
classes on the war. The institute's seminars draw experts and buffs 
from across the country, and every year, it awards the $50,000 
Lincoln Prize for war scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, the pickings have been a bit slim for undergraduates.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was disappointed with what they had,'' admitted Jason Rose,  
20, a history major and battle re-enactor who was the first student 
to sign up for the minor. ``I came to this college to study the 
Civil War. I thought, since this was Gettysburg, Civil War central, 
they should have more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gettysburg's six-course minor will allow students to use the war  
to learn about society in the mid-1800s -- music, fine art, ethical 
issues, politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can talk about the war and who won and why, and all of  
that is important,'' said Matthew Gallman, the director Gettysburg 
hired with a Henry Luce Foundation grant. ``But you can also look 
at how war changes things. You can look at how it illuminates 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winans, an English professor, will use Civil War-era fiction to  
teach students about the 19th-century novel. A writing professor 
will ask students to use the period as inspiration, perhaps after 
visits to the battlefield. A course about ethics will look at the 
major moral quandaries of the time, then reflect on today's 
dilemmas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know of any program like it,'' said J. Holt Merchant,  
history department chair at Washington and Lee University in 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Students from other colleges can get a taste of the program  
through the Gettysburg semester, a sort of ``study abroad'' in the 
heart of Civil War territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great idea,'' said Leah Jewitt, the director of the  
U.S. Civil War Center in Baton Rouge, La. ``If you only focus on 
the battles, you're missing a lot of it. These soldiers were human 
beings, they lived in a context. They weren't just robots going out 
to fight a war.''

<HEADLINE> Homes Sinking in Philadelphia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- For years, people living in the rowhouses  
along Hegerman Street had complained of cracked walls and floors so 
slanted that doors would stick and eggs would slide out of the 
frying pan. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, last week, the city came knocking on the doors of seven  
homes in the blue-collar northeast Philadelphia neighborhood with 
an urgent message: Your houses are sinking into the ground and 
could collapse at any moment. You must evacuate -- NOW. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the news could sink in, city-leased moving vans were  
rumbling down the narrow street and crews were hurriedly loading 
belongings from the small, meticulously maintained rowhouses. 
People scrambled to pack; many cleaned and swept out their homes 
before closing the doors forever. 
</P>
<P>
	That was Friday. Since then, the displaced residents' disbelief  
has turned to anger at city officials who aren't sure whether they 
will provide financial help. And neighbors on an adjacent street 
are waiting for word on whether they will be next to go. 
</P>
<P>
	The homes were built in the 1920s on top of old creek beds that  
were filled with a 21-foot layer of ash and cinders. Residents had 
complained for years about crooked floors and windows. The city 
buttressed several of the homes, then determined two months ago 
that the problem had worsened. 
</P>
<P>
	Roseanne Allen, whose son David and his wife lived for seven  
years on Hegerman Street, said she was shocked by the shifting and 
cracking during a recent visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was cooking an egg on the frying pan, and it slid out and  
fell on the kitchen floor,'' she said. ``I couldn't believe my 
eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Richard Durr stopped by to take a last look at his  
house, which will probably be demolished with the six others by the 
end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I lived in that house 38 years and raised four kids in there,  
and every time they raised my taxes I paid them. Now they tell us 
we're out of luck? It's inhuman,'' said Durr, who is staying with 
relatives in neighboring Bucks County. Others are living in hotel 
suites paid for by the city. 
</P>
<P>
	City and state officials are inspecting the site to determine  
whether sewer work done by the city in 1996 worsened the problem. 
The possibility came to light this week after a resident produced a 
videotape he shot that shows stream water flowing through a 30-foot 
trench dug by the crews. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's at least some new evidence that what the Water  
Department did may have exacerbated the problem,'' Mayor Edward G. 
Rendell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rendell initially said the city would not reimburse residents  
for their homes because the neighborhood was built before the city 
regulated home construction. Residents say their homeowners 
insurance policies will not cover the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	City Councilwoman Joan L. Krajewski said she will fight  
construction of a planned baseball stadium if the city refuses to 
release any money. She is also lobbying for state and federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're ready to help out all the city fat cats with the  
stadium,'' she said. The city should instead ``take care of our own 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials would not give cost estimates, which will depend on  
how many houses are ultimately affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspectors also are looking over five more homes on Devereaux  
Street -- also built over an old creek bed -- to determine whether 
they, too, must be evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, my house is already condemned -- I won't be able  
to sell it now. I'm a working-class stiff. What am I supposed to 
do?'' said Joseph McDowell, a 22-year resident of the block. ``I'll 
end up paying a mortgage on a hole in the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDowell said his house started flooding and shifting only after  
the 1996 sewer work. 
</P>
<P>
	Building houses over stream beds and flood plains was standard  
practice during the early part of the century in Philadelphia and 
across the country, said Anne Whiston Spirn, professor of landscape 
architecture and co-director of urban studies at the University of 
Pennsylvania. Ash was commonly used as fill because it was cheap 
and readily available. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether such homes will eventually cave in depends on the type  
of fill and the construction of the foundations, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia has seen the problem before. In 1987, the city paid  
about $20 million to bail out homeowners in the city's Logan 
section after about 1,000 homes were found to be sinking. 
Underground streams had eroded the ash landfill under the 
80-year-old homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lesson is to pay attention to what's underground and not  
to think natural laws stop operating at the city limits,'' Spirn 
said.

<HEADLINE> GM, UAW Chiefs Begin Contract Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- There was no sign of the acrimony  
that has long marked relations between General Motors Corp. and the 
United Auto Workers as their leaders began the long process of 
negotiating a new national contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Just the opposite: It was all smiles and comments chosen to  
offend nobody. Quite remarkable, too, since just last summer the 
world's largest automaker and its biggest union were embroiled in a 
pair of costly strikes that only made their bad relationship worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess the days of everybody beatin' the drum and rattling  
the swords are gone,'' UAW President Stephen P. Yokich told 
reporters Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary L. Cowger, the executive GM brought in to repair its union  
relations, repeated the policy that GM adopted shortly after the 
strikes, which cost it about $2 billion in lost revenue and a chunk 
of market share it has yet to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've said since last summer that it is of utmost importance  
to the top leadership of this company to improve our communications 
with the UAW,'' Cowger said. ``We continue to work on that and 
continue to make that a focus and a priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even cynical UAW leaders said they were now convinced GM was  
serious. Richard Shoemaker, the union's chief GM negotiator, said 
the relationship has changed considerably since the strikes, but 
that the change has yet to filter down to the plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, that's where it ultimately has to get to for it to  
be successful, and I think it would be premature to say it's 
reached that point yet,'' he said. ``I also think it would be 
unfair not to say that I believe there's a sincere interest in 
doing just that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM had good reason to dump its get-tough stance. It need only  
look to rival Ford Motor Co., which has not had a national contract 
strike in 23 years and is the industry's poster company for good 
union relations. Ford today is the most profitable of Detroit's 
automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's strikes were largely over plant work rules and the  
loss of work to outside suppliers, issues that will be back on the 
table in these national negotiations. The focus of the work-rule 
debate is expected to be GM's plans to adopt ``modular assembly'' 
techniques at its small-car plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Modular assembly uses outside, lower-cost suppliers to do more  
subassembly work. The suppliers deliver to the plant large parts 
``modules,'' such as an entire preassembled door or dashboard. As a 
result, fewer high-wage UAW workers are needed for final assembly 
of the car. 
</P>
<P>
	The future of workers at GM's former parts subsidiary, Delphi  
Automotive Systems Corp., also is a key issue in these 
negotiations. GM divested Delphi in an initial public offering and 
stock transfer earlier this year, over the union's objections. 
</P>
<P>
	As a concession to the union, GM and Delphi have agreed to keep  
Delphi workers under terms of the new GM contract for at least the 
next three years, according to sources on both sides who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The triennial contract talks with Detroit's automakers began  
Monday at Ford Motor Co. and were followed Tuesday by an initial 
meeting at DaimlerChrysler AG. The talks will continue through the 
summer and intensify in early September when the union will pick a 
lead company to negotiate economic issues. The current three-year 
pacts expire Sept. 14.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wishes Gore Good Luck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- As Al Gore began his White House quest Wednesday  
in Tennessee, President Clinton chimed in from Europe with some 
campaign advice and a good luck message. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president believes that it's time for the vice president  
to get out and make the case, let the country know who he is, where 
he wants to take the country,'' White House press secretary Joe 
Lockhart said. ``He takes an important first step on that journey 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart, answering reporters' questions following Clinton's  
speech to the International Labor Organization, said the 
administration's economic, education and environmental policies 
``will prove to be a very successful platform'' for Gore's 
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wished Gore good luck during a telephone call from a  
limousine as the president headed to the Geneva airport and a 
flight to Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in Paris, Clinton watched Gore's announcement, telephoned  
him again and said the speech was ``terrific,'' according to 
Lockhart.

<HEADLINE> Scientist Eye Hypoallergenic Rubber / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- A milky latex found in a native  
Southwestern plant may be just what the doctor orders someday for 
the millions of Americans allergic to conventional rubber products. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists in California and Arizona are exploring ways to  
maximize production and extraction of the latex found in the 
guayule (pronounced why-YOU-lee) shrub, which is free of the 
allergens found in the Brazilian rubber tree. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called Habea Brasiliensis is the most widely used source  
of rubber in gloves, catheters, condoms and many other medical, 
industrial and household products. But it has proteins that can 
cause reactions ranging from rashes to anaphylactic shock. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of U.S. citizens who may suffer such allergies has  
been estimated to be from 2 million up to 20 million. Studies have 
clearly shown the two highest at-risk populations are children who 
undergo numerous surgical procedures at young ages and health-care 
workers, as sensitivity is correlated with exposure rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's got so bad that many medical workers have to give up  
their professions,'' said Francis S. Nakayama, a scientist with the 
U.S. Agricultural Research Service in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Guayule rubber experiments date back at least to the World War  
II era, when the United States initiated the Emergency Rubber 
Project after being cut off from its main supply in southeast Asia, 
Nakayama said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another project was spawned in the mid-1980s by the severe  
shortage of another rubber source -- petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
	But those experiments focused more on tires than anything else,  
and the extraction process was entirely different than it is now, 
Nakayama said. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the 1990s, most experiments focused on the guayule shrub's  
solid rubber -- which hasn't been produced commercially in the 
United States since 1929 -- rather than its latex, which is rubber 
particles suspended in water. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowadays, breeding improvements and genetic engineering have  
resulted in superior guayule lines, with seeds selected for faster 
growth and higher latex yield. 
</P>
<P>
	Katrina Cornish, a plant physiologist at the ARS center,  
estimates that the guayule lines being tested contain up to 10 
percent latex. 
</P>
<P>
	Working with a patented process, her team has developed a faster  
and easier way to boost latex levels, by transferring the genes 
that do the work without having to pierce the plants with a very 
thin needle -- a more cumbersome and less productive method. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornish and her colleagues bath leaves in a solution that  
contains a microbe that is genetically reworked so it can slip 
inside guayule cells. Leaf pieces are then nurtured to form shoots 
and roots. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers collaborated on a way to extract at least 90  
percent of the latex in each plant by grinding small branch pieces 
in blenders and then filtering and spinning the liquid. 
</P>
<P>
	These and other experiments, including cloning, are under way  
with the hope that even a small boost will translate into 
significant increases in potential profits, since the latex will be 
a high-premium product.

<HEADLINE> Md. Couple Kept Lottery Win Quiet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- George and Celia Poteet said they waited three  
weeks before claiming their $31.5 million Big Game jackpot so their 
two sons could finish the school year without distraction. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple finally came forward Tuesday, the day after telling  
their sons on the last day of school. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very hard,'' said Mrs. Poteet, 41.  
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't tell anyone except for a couple of people,''  
including Mrs. Poteet's mother and an accountant, her husband said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Poteets, of Millersville, admit the windfall was a  
distraction to their teen-age boys, who had noticed their parents' 
unusual behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Poteet quit her job as an X-ray technician at the  
Orthopedic and Sports Medicine Center in Annapolis two weeks ago. 
Her husband, 48, said he hasn't decided whether to stick with his 
job as a computer analyst for the Department of Defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of weird. You spend your whole life working and then  
one day, you don't have to work anymore,'' he said. ``It's a tough 
thing to deal with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Poteet bought $3 worth of lottery tickets. He chose the cash  
option, making the winning ticket worth $31.5 million before taxes, 
lottery officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Poteets said they haven't bought any expensive items since  
they learned they won and don't have any plans yet on how they will 
spend the money. For now, they said, their lives are quite full 
with church activities, soccer, baseball and Boy Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if we do build our dream house,'' Mrs. Poteet said, ``it  
will be in Anne Arundel County.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Big Game is played in seven states: Massachusetts, Georgia,  
Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Virginia and New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> Scores Indicted in Stock Fraud Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Capping a three-year securities fraud  
investigation, federal authorities in Brooklyn charged 85 people 
Wednesday with ripping off more than $100 million from thousands of 
unwitting investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said in three separate indictments that nine corrupt  
brokerage firms -- including some with ties to organized crime -- 
used high-pressure and misleading sales pitches to inflate the 
value of 20 microcap stocks. The defendants turned a profit by 
dumping the small-company shares at inflated prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mob never saw a market it didn't want to control,'' Lewis  
Schiliro, head of the FBI's New York office, said at a news 
conference. ``The bull market is attracting more than just the 
honest investor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Zachary Carter said authorities relied on an  
ongoing series of undercover operations to reveal a ``classic 
boiler-room scheme.'' The scheme involved ``a nest of securities 
scam artists who worked in close cooperation, migrating from 
brokerage firm to brokerage firm,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One $10 million scam was led by two associates of both the  
Colombo crime family and one from the Bor Russian crime group, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The reputed mobsters allegedly infiltrated now-closed New York  
branches of Global Strategies Inc., Amerivet Dymally Securities and 
First National Equity Corp. They paid kickbacks to registered and 
unregistered brokers as incentive to cold call potential investors 
and pitch dubious startup companies, including one which claimed to 
be developing golf courses in the South, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants in a similar plot laundered millions of dollars in  
illegal proceeds through offshore bank accounts, authorities said. 
The funds were eventually wired to Nevada casinos, where they were 
withdrawn in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants were being arraigned Wednesday in Brooklyn  
federal court on charges including securities fraud conspiracy, 
mail and wire fraud, money laundering and obstruction of justice. 
The most serious charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in 
prison.

<HEADLINE> House Exploring Social Security Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The public political conflicts that often  
block efforts to fix Social Security can be avoided if Republicans 
and Democrats work out their differences behind closed doors, a 
leading GOP lawmaker says. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Ways and Means Committee is meeting in private  
Thursday to begin exploring possible compromise, said the panel's 
chairman, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bipartisan caucus is a real breakthrough that could lead  
to action this year on Social Security,'' Archer said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge government retirement program is healthy now, but it  
faces insolvency by 2034 as the baby boom generation collects its 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	After hearing from several outside experts on Social Security at  
the closed session, Archer said he will ask the panel's members 
``to engage in an open and frank discussion ... to see how we might 
be able to come together to solve this problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Charles Rangel of New  
York, said the private session would remove some of the ``political 
aspect'' from Social Security, long one of the most sensitive of 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we really can get something done,'' Rangel said.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite the optimism, there are deep divisions between the two  
parties, and between President Clinton and Congress. They differ 
greatly on ways to shore up the program and on the scope and 
financing of supplementary personal retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Some problems were on stark display Tuesday when the Senate  
failed again to break a Democratic filibuster against legislation 
that would set up parliamentary roadblocks to prevent spending or 
tax cuts out of $1.8 trillion in Social Security surpluses over 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from criticisms that the so-called ``lock box'' measure is  
long on symbolism and short on real enforcement, Democrats said 
they won't support it until they can offer amendments to also set 
aside Medicare money. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are precluded from offering amendments, we will oppose  
it on procedural grounds,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom 
Daschle, D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he would continue to  
force votes on the Senate measure and a House-passed alternative in 
hopes of intensifying political pressure on Democrats to drop their 
filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to keep coming back to this repeatedly,'' Lott  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress last week demonstrated how difficult it will be to keep  
from spending the Social Security surplus: the Defense Department 
authorization bill included $15.6 billion in spending out of 
surplus for various military needs.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Block Social Security Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With both parties eyeing the 2000 elections,  
Senate Democrats blocked a House-passed bill today that Republicans 
say would make it harder to spend Social Security surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP effort came even as Congress illustrated the spending  
pressures felt by lawmakers, including Republicans. One Republican 
senator lost an attempt to win an extra $70 million for solar 
energy, other senators were seeking guaranteed loans for steel, oil 
and gas companies, and the House voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to 
boost aviation spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pressure to spend here is enormous when there is no  
counterbalance and political downside,'' said Sen. Rick Santorum, 
R-Pa., a sponsor of the Social Security measure. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fourth time this year that Democrats have prevented  
the Senate from approving GOP-written bills fencing off Social 
Security funds for tax cuts or more spending. The votes underline 
the partisan struggle for the political high-ground over the 
popular pension program for the elderly and disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Social Security money that comes for Social Security ought to  
be spent on Social Security,'' said Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich. 
``To me, that is self-evident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The measure blocked Wednesday would require 60 of the 100  
senators to approve diverting Social Security funds to other uses. 
On a party-line 55-44 roll call, the Senate fell five votes short 
of the 60 needed to end Democratic delays that prevented a final 
vote on the measure. Only Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who was 
traveling with the president in Europe, missed the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved it May 26 by 416-12.  
</P>
<P>
	Three other times, Democrats have prevented the Senate from  
approving a more stringent bill requiring that Social Security 
surpluses be used to reduce the accumulated federal debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats began their delays Wednesday after Republicans refused  
to let them offer an amendment that would set aside $698 billion in 
non-Social Security surpluses over the next 15 years to revamp 
Medicare, the health-care program for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	That amendment would reduce money available for the big tax cut  
Republicans want. Democrats believe they have a winning issue if 
they pit a Medicare overhaul against GOP tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the choice between Medicare and tax cuts or just tax  
cuts, our Republican colleagues are choosing just tax cuts every 
time,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats noted that the measure would allow exceptions for any  
legislation labeled as Social Security or Medicare ``reform,'' and 
that the Senate already has rules in effect requiring 60 votes for 
using Social Security funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Senate voted 97-2 to approve a $21.7 billion  
measure financing federal water and energy projects for fiscal 
2000, which begins Oct. 1. The bill includes increases for security 
at Energy Department nuclear weapons laboratories in response to 
findings that the Chinese have stolen secrets from them. 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. James Jeffords, R-Vt., and Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., voted  
no and Harkin did not vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords tried adding $70 million to the measure's $354 million  
for solar and other renewable energy projects, but lost 60-39. 
</P>
<P>
	Last minute changes included setting aside $1.5 million for  
zebra muscle research, sponsored by Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and 
Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii; $800,000 by Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, to 
commemorate the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark expedition; and 
$5 million for a University of Missouri research reactor by that 
state's two GOP senators, John Ashcroft and Christopher Bond. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate also approved an $8.3 billion measure financing  
military construction by 97-2. Sens. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., and 
John McCain, R-Ariz., voted ``no,'' and Harkin missed the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	And by a 95-4 vote, it approved a $1.7 billion bill financing  
Congress' own operations. Voting ``no'' were Sens. Max Baucus, 
D-Mont.; Kent Conrad, D-N.D.; Phil Gramm, R-Texas; and Bob Smith, 
R-N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate is still debating a proposal by Sens. Robert Byrd,  
D-W.Va., and Pete Domenici, R-N.M., to use $270 million in 
taxpayers' money to back up to $1.5 billion in loans for ailing 
steel, gas and oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Santorum voted Tuesday to allow debate on that bill to proceed,  
bucking fellow conservatives who said it would allow spending from 
the Social Security surplus. He said Wednesday he will oppose the 
bill on final passage if it includes a provision that would allow 
that to occur. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, the House approved a five-year, $57 billion plan  
for aviation spending, a $14 billion increase over current plans.

<HEADLINE> Greene Sets Record for 100 Meters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Maurice Greene set a 100-meter world  
record today of 9.79 seconds at an international track meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene broke the mark of 9.84 set in 1996 by Donovan Bailey of  
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The record was set on a nearly windless evening during a special  
100-meter invitational race in the stadium that will be the main 
venue for the 2004 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expected it,'' Greene said. ``This is only the beginning.''  
</P>
<P>
	Greene's unofficial time was flashed as 9.78. The official time  
later was changed to 9.79. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd gave the Kansas City native a standing ovation as he  
hugged other athletes and waved the banner of his track club. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his next goal was 9.76.  
</P>
<P>
	Ato Boldon of Trinidad &AMP; Tobago finished second at 9.86 and  
Bruny Surin of Canada third at 9.97. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's very significant we came to the birthplace of  
track and field to break this record,'' Boldon said.

<HEADLINE> Human Rights Group Criticizes U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amnesty International singled out the United  
States in its annual report on human rights abuses for the nation's 
continued use of the death penalty, particularly against people who 
committed crimes before they were 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Just six countries in the world execute such killers, according  
to the group. The other nations are Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi 
Arabia and Yemen, which recently passed legislation to end the 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent school shootings such as the ones in Littleton, Colo.,  
and Conyers, Ga., have made it difficult to win support for easing 
penalties for juvenile offenders, acknowledged William F. Schulz, 
executive director of Amnesty International. However, enforcing the 
death penalty has not proven to be a deterrent to criminal youths, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given that the kids, for the most part, who are involved in  
these shootings are suburban kids who have not been in trouble with 
the law before, it simply is not good criminological analysis to 
believe that by getting tough on juveniles you're going to somehow 
prevent the killings in the schools,'' Schulz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the Amnesty International report painted a chilling  
picture of human rights violations around the world. The 
organization reported an increase among underground cases of 
torture, disappearances and political assassinations. 
</P>
<P>
	Nations where torture or ill treatment were reported jumped from  
55 percent to 66 percent between 1988 to 1999. Countries with 
torture-related deaths increased from 22 percent to 27 percent 
during that same period, and documented disappearances more than 
doubled from 9 percent to 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because there are no structures of accountability, such as an  
international criminal court, leaders of the world and military 
officials and police officials believe they can get away with 
anything as long as they can cover it up and keep it quiet,'' 
Schulz said. 
</P>
<P>
	As an example, the report says the atrocities committed against  
Kosovo Albanians over the past several months might have been 
prevented had global authorities taken into custody former Bosnian 
Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military chief, Gen. 
Ratko Mladic. Both men were indicted by a U.N. tribunal on charges 
of Bosnian war crimes, but they remain at large. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had NATO been willing to take them into custody at an early  
date, it would have sent a very clear message to (Yugoslav 
President Slobodan) Milosevic that he personally might well pay for 
being responsible for the kind of crimes that we certainly believe 
he's responsible for,'' Schulz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization also had some positive news to report:  
Participation in the human rights movement has grown throughout the 
world over the past decade, mainly because the Internet made it 
easier to spread the word about violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Wide Web has been a major factor in raising awareness,  
because it has allowed information to flow freely in and out of 
countries with censor-heavy governments. 
</P>
<P>
	``So when a prisoner of conscience in China is arrested because  
he tries to form a democratic party there or issues a statement 
about democracy, the Chinese government can't cover that up,'' 
Schulz said. ``That information is immediately available to human 
rights groups here in the United States and around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, advocates have been successful in helping reduce  
the number of nations that carry out government executions or jail 
political and religious prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	Amnesty International reported that the percentage of countries  
that conducted state executions dropped from 21 percent to 19 
percent between 1988 and 1998. Nations that incarcerated 
``prisoners of conscience'' dropped from 44 percent to 41 percent 
during the same period.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lobbies for Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House today accused House  
Republicans of trying to stymie gun restrictions while cutting 
money for new police officers, saying they are ``making the case 
for less cops and more guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, traveling in Europe, also tried to shore up  
support for gun-control legislation among wavering Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called two Democrats, Reps. Nicholas Lampson of Texas  
and Bob Etheridge of North Carolina, from Air Force One en route to 
Geneva, where he addressed the International Labor Organization, 
said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. He said Clinton planned to 
call other Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president fully recognizes the political nature of this  
kind of vote,'' the spokesman said. ``He believes that these are 
sensible measures that the public demands, but he also remembers 
quite clearly'' that Democrats have ``suffered'' because of past 
gun votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think the president believes that the country has  
shifted on these issues and it's important that people stand up,'' 
the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said the ``very pervasive influence'' of the National  
Rifle Association over the past few weeks has watered down 
Senate-passed restrictions and opened new loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
	In calls to lawmakers, Clinton will tell them ``the public is  
expecting them to do the people's business and not the NRA's,'' 
Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also took aim at Republican leaders for seeking to cut  
funding for Clinton's program to allow local communities to hire 
more officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a situation where the Republican leadership is making  
the case for less cops and more guns and the Democratic leadership 
is making the case for more cops and less guns,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's a powerful message that needs to be articulated  
as we move toward the vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's effort to hold Democrats in line tracks attempts by  
the House's top Democrat, Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, to 
persuade two senior Democrats not to join Republicans in sponsoring 
an NRA-backed gun proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA's chief lobbyist believes 40 to 50 Democrats may support  
the proposal backed by one of the senior Democrats, Rep. John 
Dingell of Michigan, and 15 to 20 Republicans may support a White 
House-backed version that cleared the Senate, with more undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	Dingell's proposal contains a provision on gun show background  
checks that is less restrictive than the Senate-passed measure. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democratic leaders have seized on the issue in the wake of  
the Colorado school shootings in April, believing it can help the 
party win control of the House in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Roundup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the  
United States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	June 14  
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Herald, on refugees in Colombia and elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	The world keeps track of Kosovo's refugees and offers them hope.  
Not so Colombia's. Or Sudan's, Angola's, or Afghanistan's. That 
must change. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Emissaries for the U.N. High Commissioner of Refugees visiting a  
makeshift camp of several hundred of these victims of civil war in 
northwest Colombia were shocked by what they saw and heard: 
Children playing in sewage, hacking coughs throughout, the hollow 
eyes and distended bellies of malnutrition. In Turbo, where some 
3,000 people have fled, authorities packed people into a gymnasium. 
There were and are no TV cameras to broadcast their plight. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Much the same situation exists in Sudan, where 16 years of  
conflict between black southern Sudanese against Arab Muslims in 
the North has killed 1.9 million and uprooted 4.3 million people. 
...
</P>
<P>
	As in the Balkans, it is not sufficient to lament human tragedy  
when one has the means at hand to assuage it. 

</P>
<P>
	June 14  
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Oklahoman, Oklahoma City, on welfare:  
</P>
<P>
	The Law of Unintended Consequences often overrides liberal good  
intentions. When welfare programs rewarded women for the number of 
babies they bore, the number of illegitimate births went up. When 
the secular fundamentalists went after school prayers, students 
began praying spontaneously -- as happened at a Maryland graduation 
ceremony this spring when nearly the entire student body and 
audience began saying The Lord's Prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Law of Unintended Consequences is now producing a surge of  
gun and ammunition sales, according to last Tuesday's Wall Street 
Journal. Folks can't get guns fast enough, in order to beat a 
perceived federal crackdown on gun sales. Meantime, operators 
staffing the phones at the National Rifle Association reportedly 
can't keep up with calls requesting new memberships. 
</P>
<P>
	So Bill Clinton's hysteria-fueled gun control measures will  
increase the number of guns in circulation, probably by millions of 
units. NRA membership will likely reach record levels, giving the 
group more money and more power to fight future ill-advised gun 
control efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	While gun control is stimulating sales, God control is  
stimulating prayer. There's a sort of divine justice in all this. 
The Law of Unintended Consequences expresses itself in freedom. 
Tell a teen-ager he can't pray and that's exactly what he'll want 
to do. Tell a citizen he can't buy a certain gun after a certain 
date and he'll rush to beat the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks, liberals. You're making our day.  

</P>
<P>
	June 16  
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times, on gun control:  
</P>
<P>
	House Republican leaders have already forgotten Speaker Dennis  
Hastert's pledge last month to support ``common-sense'' gun 
control. Instead of moving to strengthen and expand upon the 
handful of gun control initiatives heading for votes on the House 
floor this week, G.O.P. leaders have worked out a scheme to make it 
easier for lawmakers who take their cue from the National Rifle 
Association to vote against meaningful reform. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Originally the House was to consider a single juvenile-justice  
bill with gun control amendments attached -- the course followed by 
the Senate. Now the Republican leadership has decided to present 
two bills. One is expected to include a range of harsh 
juvenile-crime provisions, as well as a plainly unconstitutional 
crackdown on the dissemination of violent material by the media. 
... The other will contain the gun control provisions. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Americans are asking Congress to take meaningful steps against  
gun violence, not to impose curbs on free speech. House Republicans 
may have forgotten their promise, but voters should not forget what 
the House does this week.

	The Albuquerque Tribune, on THAAD missile program:  
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't make sense at this point to blow up the THAAD missile  
program now being tested in New Mexico, as some critics suggest. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government has spent $4 billion in taxpayer money on  
the project. And the missile test last Thursday finally achieved a 
success, hitting and destroying a target missile over White Sands 
in an aerial exhibition that could be witnessed from Albuquerque. 
Advocates, including New Mexico's U.S. Sen. Jeff Bingaman, argue 
that the problems that have caused the THAAD to fail embarrassingly 
six times before are relatively minor. With this latest promise of 
success, why throw away $4 billion of effort? ...

	Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette, on sex education:  
</P>
<P>
	The good news is that America's notorious rate of unwed  
pregnancy has dropped in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	The bad news is that this harmful pattern still is much worse in  
America than in most other advanced nations. 
</P>
<P>
	When an unmarried girl gets pregnant, it often leads to one of  
two sad outcomes: Either she gets an abortion, a traumatic 
experience -- or she joins the army of single mothers struggling to 
raise children alone. 
</P>
<P>
	The latter outcome hurts everyone. The girl may drop out of  
school, ruining her chance for a good career. Her child is more 
likely to lag in learning, become delinquent, abuse drugs, and 
repeat the cycle of unwed pregnancy. Taxpayers are stuck for 
welfare and police costs. America loses much of the young woman's 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
	Why does unwed pregnancy hit America worse than most Western  
nations? Is it because young people elsewhere are more moral? Of 
course not. 
</P>
<P>
	We think it's because other nations have matter-of-fact sex  
education which teaches teens responsible behavior. Those countries 
care enough to rescue their young from ruin. 
</P>
<P>
	But America's puritanism hinders saving U.S. youth. In this  
country, conservative groups think it's wicked to inform public 
school students about sex. Teaching birth control outrages the 
Catholic Church, and many fundamentalist Protestants think it 
implies tacit approval of sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the ``religious right'' and much of the Republican Party,  
the only allowable course is to tell students to abstain from sex -- 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	We don't object to teaching abstinence. We just think it's a  
simplistic, moralistic approach unlikely to succeed. However, all 
kids should be taught the dangers of sexual diseases and pregnancy, 
which may cause some to abstain. ...

	Odessa (Texas) American, on federal oversight of gambling:  
</P>
<P>
	For the majority of patrons at casinos, horse and dog tracks and  
other gambling enterprises across the nation, games of chance are 
harmless recreation. 
</P>
<P>
	For an unfortunate minority, that recreation leads to an  
addiction. 
</P>
<P>
	To the majority, we say good luck; to the minority, we can only  
urge you to come to your senses, think of your families, get 
counseling and, if nothing else, remember the adage that a fool and 
his money are soon parted. 
</P>
<P>
	In any event, whether gambling-related pathologies involve  
gamblers themselves or the presumed side-effects of casinos upon 
surrounding communities, the majority of states where gambling now 
is present have more than ample regulatory oversight to deal with 
that industry. 
</P>
<P>
	So, why did Congress bother impaneling a National Gambling  
Impact Study Commission? And you only have to look at the findings 
of the panel to see the effort is misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission members both those from the industry itself as  
well as gambling critics, like Focus on the Family's James Dobson, 
are of course sincere in their effort to counter the pastime's ill 
effects on society. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the federal government has no business in any of that and  
certainly shouldn't try to meddle in it over and above the myriad 
state and local regulations in effect. ...

	Mail Tribune, Medford, Ore., on requiring photo IDs in movie  
theaters: 
</P>
<P>
	Is this some miracle cure for youth violence? Of course not. But  
there is no substitute for good parenting, and this new policy will 
help those parents who are trying to do a good job. 
</P>
<P>
	It will help in ways practical and symbolic. It will stop  
children who go unaccompanied to R-rated movies; and it will 
reinforce the message that parents are responsible for what their 
children see. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone except the lobbyists and the shills knows that the  
roots of youth violence and disillusion are deep and complex -- a 
whole lot more complex than the bickering by the National Rifle 
Association or the Motion Picture Association of America would ever 
acknowledge. ... 

</P>
<P>
	June 9  
</P>
<P>
	South County Journal, Kent, Wash., on children and violent  
movies: 
</P>
<P>
	Theater owners across the country are doing the right thing by  
requiring photo identification from young people under the age of 
17 who want to see an R-rated movie. Video stores should do the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
	By their action, thousands of theater owners acknowledge the  
public's concern and President Clinton's complaint that there is 
``too much violence through media and cultural contacts.'' 
Requiring young people to produce photographic proof that they are 
old enough to see an R-rated movie will lessen concerns of parents 
as to what their children see when they drop them off at the 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Theater Owners represents about  
20,000 screens -- 65 percent of the movie screens in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	By age 18, the typical American will have seen over 40,000  
dramatized murders. Not all of those come via the movies but enough 
do so that more control is warranted over who sees what. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes sense for the big screen also should be followed when  
movies move into video stores. R-rated movies should not be rented 
to young people unless they can show photographic proof that they 
are at least age 17. The TV screen may be smaller but the violence 
can be just as disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
	None of this calls for censoring the films themselves. Film  
makers have a constitutional right to follow whatever artistic road 
they choose. But that doesn't mean that the rest of us, 
particularly our children, should be allowed to trot along. 
</P>
<P>
	Adults can make their own movie decisions. Until then, parents  
should have the final say and theater and video store owners should 
respect and support those views.

	ABC, Madrid, Spain, on Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	The federal Yugoslav army is withdrawing from Kosovo ... but its  
withdrawal is not sufficient to guarantee the security of the 
province. The Albanian guerrillas have to be disarmed now. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack on civilian Serbs who were abandoning Kosovo, shots  
on British parachuters that were investigating the death of a 
neighbor Serb of Pristina and the entrance of guerrillas in Prizren 
with attributes of a police force, offered three examples yesterday 
of the intentions of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). 
</P>
<P>
	The unequal combat with the Yugoslav army during the Allied  
attacks could have given it a certain aura of heroism, but in 
substance nothing has changed. The KLA, which has not been a 
military arm of the Alliance during the campaign, can not now be 
its political partner. 
</P>
<P>
	As simply one of the parts of the conflict, the KLA should  
subject itself to the authority of KFOR and disarm itself. ... 

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	Tagesspiegel, Berlin, on Kosovo Liberation Army's role:  
</P>
<P>
	What will happen with the KLA? The political leader of the  
Kosovo underground organization, Hashim Thaci, is leaving it ... 
open, whether he foresees the KLA of the future as a regular army 
or a political party. The reason for this expected uncertainty lies 
in the agreement between Belgrade and NATO -- it foresees autonomy 
for Kosovo within the Yugoslav federation and thereby falls short 
of the demand for a fully independent Kosovo that Thaci pushed for 
at the negotiations in Rambouillet (France). This question will 
still raise some problems. It is also understandable that the KLA 
wants to remain armed in case of possible Serb attacks in the 
future. But NATO in its military movements can't consider that 
during these critical days, as they work to prevent a security 
vacuum with the Serbs withdrawal. Added to that is the fact of 
important evidence that NATO obtains from the KLA on mass graves 
and refugees. Is the organization a friend or a foe? The answer can 
only be: If the principles of the G8 states are to be believeably 
achieved and the chance of a multi-ethnic Kosovo, at least at the 
starting point, is to be retained, then the KLA must also let 
itself be disarmed.

<P>
	Mainichi Shimbun, Tokyo, on Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	The safe return of Albanian refugees is the immediate task at  
hand. The chief objective of the air campaign, after all, was to 
stop ethnic cleansing. Only after the refugees peacefully resettle 
in their former communities can NATO claim true victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Air strikes may have been necessary to end Slobodan Milosevic's  
ethnic conflicts, but they also crippled civilian targets. The U.N. 
Security Council is the proper forum to consider global responses 
to ethnic conflicts. NATO, however, had no intention of going 
through the council, where it was certain to face a veto from China 
and Russia, which have ethnic problems of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	We must remember that the peace plan was not achieved by the air  
campaign alone. The authority of the United Nations was required to 
avoid a ground war. Ethnic conflicts are likely to crop up again 
and we should try to revive the functions of the United Nations so 
that it may play a more effective role in the future in intervening 
on humanitarian grounds. 

</P>

</P>
<P>
	The Sydney (Australia) Morning Herald, on Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	Although the need to accommodate an unpredictable Russia in the  
Kosovo peacekeeping arrangements will continue to test NATO, it is 
probably not the greatest test ahead. That will concern the future 
status of Kosovo which is presently a province of the Republic of 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO insists on the need to maintain the integrity of Kosovo.  
NATO will not want it said that it waged war in Yugoslavia to 
destroy it. Yet once President Milosevic embraced a policy of 
``ethnic cleansing'' in Kosovo, his Serb-dominated government 
itself put the province's future status under question. The return 
of the hundreds of thousands of Kosovo Albanians driven out of 
their homes by Serb military, police and irregular forces is 
imperative. The restoration of harmony between the Kosovars and 
their Serb neighbors is a noble goal. But the reality, which will 
become clearer in the months to come, is that for many of the 
people of Kosovo, Serbs and Kosovars alike, there can be no going 
back. 

</P>
<P>
	June 15  
</P>
<P>
	Le Monde, Paris, on Western nations and Russia:  
</P>
<P>
	Jacques Chirac never misses an opportunity to proclaim ``We must  
not humiliate the Russians.'' Bill Clinton doesn't shout it so loud 
-- it's not too good electorally -- but he thinks like the French 
president. The German Chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, holds the same 
position. Boris Yeltsin must not be weakened in the name of 
defending a ``moderate'' camp in the Kremlin that threatens the 
nationalist Communist camp in the Duma. 
</P>
<P>
	So from Chechnya, where the Russian army killed 30,000 and razed  
a capital, to the several tens of billions of dollars of financial 
aid, of which a substantial chunk went swiftly back into Swiss and 
New York bank accounts, we always find a compromise with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	The current negotiations could determine the success, or  
derailment, of the KFOR operations. Also dependent on these results 
is the answer to the question of who humiliates whom in the 
relations between Russia and the West. The answer unfortunately is 
not guaranteed. 

</P>
<P>
	June 15  
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Telegraph, London, on Russian role in Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	Diplomatically, the obstructive presence of the Russians makes  
NATO and its commander in Kosovo, Lt. Gen. Sir Mike Jackson, look 
foolish. Having just completed a successful air campaign, the 
world's strongest military alliance is allowing a chronically weak 
power to block the road to the airport with a few armored personnel 
carriers. That does nothing for NATO's reputation, or to reassure 
the exiled Kosovars that the province can be made safe for their 
return. 
</P>
<P>
	The impasse over the Russians' role in Kosovo must be resolved  
this week, before Boris Yeltsin meets other G8 leaders in Cologne 
on Sunday. A unified command, must be established, with Gen. 
Jackson at its head. The road to the airport must be opened. If 
that proves impossible, NATO will have to use force to clear the 
obstruction. ...

<P>
	Le Temps, Geneva, on European elections:  
</P>
<P>
	In one place the left is destroyed, in another the right breaks  
into pieces. Governments come out reinforced or rejected. ... The 
outcome of the European elections looks a lot like people's 
perceptions of the parliament itself: a mishmash with uncertain 
powers, making unseen decisions and exerting an excessively remote 
influence over the lives of Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
	So it's not the lack of a collective interest which has caused  
the apathy over the campaign and the abstention of the voters. It's 
the weakness of the power of the members of the parliament over the 
problems of eurocitizens. The only element which brought people 
together at this weekend's vote -- to the profit of the Greens -- was 
the issue of dioxins in chicken, which was seen as a scandal where 
the Brussels ``machine'' played a part as much as the national 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, the war in Kosovo, where the influence of  
Strasbourg was nil, had no impact at all. Otherwise how could the 
English, who overwhelmingly accept Tony Blair's ``moral war,'' have 
dealt him such a blow? 

</P>

</P>
<P>
	Haaretz, Tel Aviv, Israel, on Barak government:  
</P>
<P>
	Weak kneed semi-denials have accompanied reports that Prime  
Minister-elect Ehud Barak has come to a verbal ``understanding'' 
with the leaders of the National Religious Party (hawkish patron of 
the Jewish settlers movement in the West Bank) on construction in 
the settlements, continued construction work at Har Homa 
(controversial planned Jewish neighborhood in traditionally Arab 
east Jerusalem) and a territorial link between Jerusalem and Maaleh 
Adumim (Jewish settlement in the West Bank). 
</P>
<P>
	If such an ``understanding'' has been reached, it could  
represent a serious deviation from the course that the Barak 
government has promised to navigate. The commitment to 
energetically proceed with the peace process requires Barak to 
abandon the devious methods that characterized the Netanyahu regime 
and which, time and again, produced harmful faits accomplis. ...

<P>
	The Times, London, on Wal-Mart coming to Britain:  
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas's most famous contribution to civilization is about to  
hit Britain. The imminent arrival of Wal-Mart is causing far more 
excitement than a visit from Bill Clinton would occasion. Among 
shoppers who have sampled the Wal-Mart formula, its British debut 
is being awaited with glee. Their enthusiasm is matched by the 
sheer horror with which many native retailers are digesting the 
news. 
</P>
<P>
	The two reactions are equally understandable. Wal-Mart has the  
power to bulldoze its way into a marketplace and offer prices that 
customers love and rivals loathe. 
</P>
<P>
	Its arrival in Britain is likely to shake up the retail scene  
far more drastically than anything that the government might have 
been considering in its quest to bring down prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Walton's business philosophy was simple. ``Who's Number  
One?'' he would ask rhetorically. ``The customer.'' It is 
surprising that some British retailers have yet to adopt his 
slogan. Wal-Mart's arrival will remind them that the customer is 
king, and can be a very fickle monarch.

<HEADLINE> Wizards Welcome New Coach Gar Heard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Owner Abe Pollin went with his gut instinct,  
and the Washington Wizards went with Gar Heard. 
</P>
<P>
	Heard was introduced Wednesday as the new coach of the  
struggling franchise, which was 18-32 last season and failed to 
make the playoffs for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
	He reportedly agreed to a three-year contract worth between $1.5  
million and $2 million a year. Pollin would not comment on terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one interview I had with Gar Heard blew me away,'' Pollin  
said during a press conference. ``This is a man with great inner 
strength.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said general manager Wes Unseld: ``I thought this guy fit the  
bill best of all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 51-year-old Heard replaces Jim Brovelli, who was hired as  
interim coach April 5 after Bernie Bickerstaff was fired. 
</P>
<P>
	An assistant with the Detroit Pistons last season, Heard said  
his own career as a player with Seattle, Chicago, Buffalo, and 
Phoenix gave him an advantage in working and talking with players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not asking them to do things they're not capable of  
doing,'' Heard said. ``The guys have to believe in themselves, 
believe they can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heard was interim coach of the Dallas Mavericks in 1993,  
finishing with a 9-44 record. This time around, Heard said, he'll 
be putting his own philosophy into action rather than just filling 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm starting from scratch,'' Heard said. ``I think we have the  
nucleus here to have a very good team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heard said he wants to focus on defense and rebounding, but his  
first priority is putting together a coaching staff and preparing 
for the draft. Heard also indicated he would like to re-sign free 
agent guard Mitch Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Tim Legler, who played for Heard in Dallas, said the new  
coach will help the team learn to play unselfishly and to 
communicate -- ``something the team desperately needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel we have a lot of talent,'' Legler said, ``but the  
cohesion wasn't on the court last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team met with 15 candidates before creating a short list of  
four names. Heard was first interviewed three weeks ago in 
Baltimore and met last week with owner Pollin in Chicago. They 
talked for 2 1/2 hours, mostly about Heard's coaching philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about some of the ``bigger'' names the team reportedly had  
on its wish list -- former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson, who 
just signed with Los Angeles, and former Detroit Pistons guard 
Isiah Thomas -- Unseld said money was not an issue. He said the team 
picked the coach it thought could win. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been very easy for me to pick one of these  
high-profile guys and pay them whatever they wanted,'' Unseld said. 
He said a coach should be selected based on the team's needs and 
``not a popularity contest.''

<HEADLINE> Hasek Talks Big, Backs It Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Dominik Hasek isn't known for words.  
</P>
<P>
	Impossible saves, yes. A few dozen of the world's shiniest  
trophies and medals, yes. An unorthodox style that has him flopping 
around like a flounder on a dock, yes. Wins, yes. 
</P>
<P>
	Words, no.  
</P>
<P>
	History won't immortalize Hasek for the challenge he delivered  
to his struggling teammates before Buffalo's 2-1 win over Dallas in 
Game 4 of the Stanley Cup finals Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Buffalo Sabres will never forget the speech, because it  
helped them win the biggest game of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys go and score goals,'' Hasek told his defense-minded  
team through the press on Monday. ``Don't worry about me. I'll take 
care of the net.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time defending league MVP made one thing clear: ``Be  
aggressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That meant reversing a disturbing trend for Buffalo. Since  
winning Game 1 in Dallas, the Sabres slipped to the point where 
another inch would have dropped them in Lake Erie. 
</P>
<P>
	They were outshot 29-12 in a 2-1 home loss in Game 3, their  
second straight loss. Hasek had faced plenty of rubber before, 
particularly as the Sabres slid from first place in the Eastern 
Conference to the No. 7 seed for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't mind seeing a lot of pucks; he just wanted to see a  
few go the other way. 
</P>
<P>
	He made his words stand up Tuesday with 30 saves, including 13  
in the third period to preserve the 2-1 lead the opportunistic 
Sabres built on Dallas mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about his comments after the game, Hasek downplayed them  
as coolly as he disposed of the Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just try to do my job,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hasek acknowledged his teammates' improvement. ``They were  
forechecking better, skating better, trying to stop the puck with 
their bodies,'' said Hasek, who won a gold medal for the Czech 
Republic in 1998. ``It helps me emotionally. It pumps me up and 
helps me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres sometimes forget that Hasek needs help. This time  
they were glad to respond to his 9-1-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you have your superstar step up and make himself  
noticed, guys love to see that,'' Sabres captain Michael Peca said. 
``We wanted to approach this like a Game 7, and we certainly came 
out with that kind of effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars appeared to be in denial.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Hasek was the factor in the game,'' said Dallas  
coach Ken Hitchcock, whose team coughed up both goals on defensive 
lapses and whose goalie, Ed Belfour, made some brilliant saves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hasek was good and made some great saves,'' Hitchcock said.  
``But so did Eddie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care if I'm a factor or not,'' Hasek said. ``All I  
want is the win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek played behind Belfour for two seasons in Chicago from  
1990-92, splitting time between the Blackhawks and their minor 
league affiliate in Indianapolis. He credits Belfour for teaching 
him, perhaps too well. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek's play didn't stop the Stars, according to Dallas  
defenseman Darryl Sydor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not affecting us,'' Sydor said. ``We had two or three  
opportunities where it was just us or him and we didn't bury our 
chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Something generated confidence for the Sabres. ``After tonight,  
we know we can play against this team,'' Hasek said.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Surfaces in Medical Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Abortion rights have been injected into the  
debate about a popular medical records privacy bill, which is being 
held up as senators weigh whether to allow children to keep their 
records private -- even from parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``It always comes up. Whenever there's a way, it shows up,''  
Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., said of the emotionally charged 
abortion issue. Jeffords is chairman of the Senate health committee 
that had hoped to finish work on the bill this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The crux of the legislation, which would establish the first  
federal right to privacy of medical records, has widespread 
support. Besides children's rights, senators have one other 
controversy to resolve about who can sue if medical records privacy 
is violated. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation wouldn't alter existing state laws. More than  
half the states require parental consent or notification when teens 
seek abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	But most states allow teens to seek certain types of care on  
their own, including contraception, drug treatment and mental 
health. The questions is whether teens have the right to keep 
records of those visits from their parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Also at issue was what rights the federal law might create for  
teens in states that have no abortion notification or other privacy 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Abortion opponents, led by Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., want to  
maintain the status quo, meaning minors have no rights to keep any 
medical records private. 
</P>
<P>
	But abortion rights advocates led by Sen. Edward Kennedy,  
D-Mass., are pushing to apply the new rights to minors as well as 
adults -- as long as there's no state law that says otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	If the children of a particular state are allowed to get medical  
care on their own, Kennedy argues, they should be allowed to keep 
those records private. 
</P>
<P>
	His concern is that teens would be less likely to seek medical  
treatment if they feared that their parents would find out. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the best of situations, parents can comfort and guide  
teen-agers struggling with mental or physical health issues. In 
other cases, a teen may not be comfortable or safe in sharing his 
or her concerns,'' said Jim Manley, Kennedy's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Brownback argues that parents have a right to know what's going  
on with their children. 
</P>
<P>
	``The federal government should not undermine the family unit by  
giving children the ability to exclude parents from health care 
decisions,'' he said in statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides are accusing one another of trying to push their  
abortion agendas. Jeffords, chairman of the Health, Education, 
Pensions and Labor Committee, is in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords personally supports a woman's right to choose abortion,  
but doesn't want to lose the support of his GOP colleagues. He has 
cancelled four scheduled committee votes on the medical privacy 
bill, hoping the differences can be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confident we'll find a way around the controversy,'' he  
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	And even if the notification issue is resolved, senators must  
still resolve whether patients whose records are improperly 
released can sue. Republicans want to make it difficult to file 
these suits and want to limit potential damages. Democrats want 
more expansive rights. 
</P>
<P>
	On the privacy rights of minors, both sides agree existing state  
laws, where they exist, should take precedence. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen states require parental consent for abortion, and 14  
require parental notification, with Texas and Florida soon to join 
the notification group, according to a count by the Alan Guttmacher 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Many states also explicitly authorize children to use certain  
services without parental consent, according to the institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-four allow use of contraception, 22 allow outpatient  
mental health care and 46 allow for treatment of drug and alcohol 
abuse. All 50 allow free access to HIV and AIDS services.

	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- The publishers of a book that strongly  
criticizes Chile's judges and courts were arrested and indicted 
Wednesday on charges of breaking the state security law. 
</P>
<P>
	The publishers, Bartolo Ortiz and Carlos Orellana, were arrested  
at their offices at Editorial Planeta. 
</P>
<P>
	Santiago Court of Appeals Judge Rafael Huerta last month banned  
``The Black Book of Chilean Justice,'' by journalist Alejandra 
Matus after former Chief Justice Servando Jordan sued. 
</P>
<P>
	The author left Chile, saying she feared arrest.  
</P>
<P>
	The book hit the bookstores April 14, and Jordan sued that day.  
Huerta ordered the book's 3,000 copies seized. 
</P>
<P>
	Matus described her 342-page work as a journalistic  
investigation of alleged abuse of power, corruption, influence 
peddling and nepotism by a number of judges, Jordan among them. 
</P>
<P>
	In the chapter about Jordan, the author described how he barely  
escaped removal by congress two years ago after he was formally 
accused by right-wing senators of ``failing to fulfill his duties'' 
in two drug-trafficking related cases.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Five petroleum giants have joined  
forces in a $7.5 million search for oil in an unexplored offshore 
tract 125 miles from the mouth of the Amazon River. 
</P>
<P>
	British Petroleum, Exxon's Brazilian subsidiary Esso, Shell,  
Petrobras and British Borneo on Wednesday snapped up the rights to 
explore an 8,700 square-mile area. 
</P>
<P>
	The group was the sole bidder for the area on the second day of  
Brazil's historic auction of 27 potentially oil-rich areas. The 
bidding marked the end of a 46-year monopoly over the Brazilian oil 
industry by Petrobras, the federal petroleum company.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Rescue workers digging through tons of mud in  
the northern city of Monterrey found another body Wednesday, 
raising the death toll from flash floods to 13. Thirty-three people 
remained missing. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of an unidentified woman was dug out of flood debris  
near Nuevo Leon Autonomous University, said Leticia Gonzalez, an 
official at the civil protection agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Many residents blamed the Nuevo Leon state government for the  
deaths, saying it did nothing to unclog and improve the sewer 
system in the industrial center of 3 million people. The system has 
not been renovated in more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Fernando Canales Clariond told reporters late Tuesday the  
drainage system had failed badly, but said the government can't 
afford to pay the more than $300,000 cost to modernize the network. 
</P>
<P>
	Hail the size of golf balls followed by heavy rain hit the area  
early Monday evening and continued steadily until dawn Tuesday. The 
weather service estimated precipitation at an average rate of 2 3/4 
inches every three hours.

security and boarded an Aerolineas Argentinas flight to Buenos 
Aires, Lima radio station Radioprogramas reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys had no destination and did not know where the plane was  
headed, state prosecutor Javier Carranza told reporters.

<P>
	Jose Arias, the 30-year-old mayor of Santo Domingo, was struck  
by bullets fired from the passing motorbike while riding in a sport 
utility vehicle north of Medellin, the capital of turbulent 
Antioquia state. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said they had no suspects. Antioquia is among  
Colombia's most dangerous states, and is divided into zones 
controlled by leftist rebels and their right-wing paramilitary 
foes. 
</P>
<P>
	Arias was attacked while en route to a weekly meeting of local  
officials from around the state.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules for Disabled Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A federal appeals court has ruled that companies  
are obliged to reassign disabled employees who can no longer do 
their original jobs to vacant jobs they can perform. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 9-3 Tuesday that  
the Americans With Disabilities Act requires employers to do more 
than simply ``consider'' disabled workers for reassignment to jobs 
for which they are qualified. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling reversed a lower court decision in favor of Midland  
Brake Inc. in a complaint filed by Robert Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, now deceased, worked for nearly seven years in Midland  
Brake's light assembly department, putting together and testing 
small air valve components. Smith developed muscular problems and 
chronic dermatitis on his hands from exposure to chemicals and 
other irritants on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors found him unfit to continue working in the light  
assembly department. Midland Brake was unable to find a job Smith 
could perform in that department and fired him. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal act bars employers from discriminating against a  
``qualified individual with a disability'' because of that 
disability. A qualified person is defined as one who can perform a 
job when given reasonable accommodation. 
</P>
<P>
	The circuit court said Midland Brake erred in claiming Smith was  
not a qualified person with a disability because he could not 
perform the essential functions of his existing job. 
</P>
<P>
	``If no reasonable accommodation can keep the employee in his or  
her existing job, then the reasonable accommodation may require 
reassignment to a vacant position as long as the employee is 
qualified and it does not impose an undue burden on the employer,'' 
the court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Reiskin, executive director of the Colorado  
Cross-Disability Coalition, called the decision ``wonderful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything that's going to increase employment options for  
people with disabilities is always a good thing,'' she said. ``We 
still have a 74 percent unemployment rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regulations of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  
already interpret the federal law the way the 10th Circuit did 
Tuesday. The guidelines say an employee being reassigned does not 
``compete'' for the vacant position -- he or she gets it if 
qualified.

<HEADLINE> Poor Man Saved From Pauper's Burial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For 13 years, Jose Camacho lived deep in an  
abandoned railroad tunnel. Near his life's end, advocates for the 
homeless found him a place to live. 
</P>
<P>
	Then death brought another kind of homelessness: the threat of  
anonymous burial in a potter's field. Again, strangers wouldn't let 
that happen. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Camacho was given a funeral and a donated final  
resting place in an elite suburban cemetery, near the graves of 
Tommy Dorsey and Lou Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
	Camacho had been dead in his apartment 10 days before police  
found his decomposed body on May 25. He lay another three weeks in 
a city morgue, officially unidentified. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd Coor, a police detective, convinced officials to wait a  
little longer than the two weeks the city usually holds an 
unclaimed corpse before burial 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Morton, a professor who had photographed Camacho for a  
book on the homeless, then helped identify the body from a photo of 
his tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
	When word got out about the pauper's plight, strangers offered  
about $5,000 to pay for his funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	Camacho was buried with a name Tuesday, his elaborately draped  
casket blessed by a priest as it was carried out to organ music. 
There was no family among the dozen mourners. 
</P>
<P>
	He moved to the United States from Puerto Rico when he was 16.  
In the 1970s, he lost his job as a garment district delivery man 
while battling a drinking problem, heart disease and broken 
English. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, the Coalition for the Homeless helped get him a  
sunny one-bedroom apartment. The coalition's executive director, 
Mary Brosnahan, sobbed as she walked behind his casket. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a gentleman, a rarity,'' she said. ``He was  
soft-spoken, and he always had a glimmer of hope in his eye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Dr. Thomas Hughart, pastor of Central Presbyterian  
Church on Park Avenue, read a news story about Camacho and offered 
a free plot at the Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, an exclusive 
suburb north of New York City.

<HEADLINE> US, Russia Negotiating Troop Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- The United States and its NATO allies  
will be ``as creative as we can'' in trying to accommodate Russian 
troops in Kosovo peacekeeping, but Moscow must accept that NATO is 
in command, Defense Secretary William Cohen said today. His Russian 
counterpart predicted the issue would be resolved by the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen and Russian Defense Minister Marshall Igor Sergeyev began  
a series of meetings today in the ornate Hall of Mirrors in the 
presidential palace. The two defense chiefs, with about a dozen 
aides each, sat around a long wooden table for an opening session 
to be followed by a working dinner. A second day of talks was 
expected Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we didn't have a measure of confidence we wouldn't have  
come here,'' Sergeyev said through a translator when asked whether 
he was confident of solving the problem. He declined to say whether 
Moscow would put its troops under NATO command. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said it was too early to say how the impasse might be  
ended. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview aboard his plane en route to the Finnish  
capital, Cohen said he was eager to meet with Sergeyev to discuss 
several options for including Russian troops in a NATO-run 
peacekeeping mission. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are now going to examine some of those options, try to be  
as creative as we can, while still adhering to the basic principle 
that there must be a unified command,'' Cohen told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergeyev, on arrival in Helsinki, said he believed his talks  
with Cohen would produce an agreement that the leaders of their two 
countries could sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been assigned the task ... to sort out all the issues  
under debate,'' Sergeyev told reporters. ``In this meeting, we're 
supposed to solve everything, to clear the path for a presidents in 
Cologne.'' President Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin are 
scheduled to meet Sunday at the economic summit in Cologne, 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving in Geneva this morning with Clinton and Secretary of  
State Madeleine Albright, White House press secretary Joe Lockhart 
left open the possibility that the Russian troop dispute will not 
be resolved before Clinton and Yeltsin meet. ``I don't know that 
I'd put a timetable on it, but I expect it to be resolved,'' 
Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia surprised and upset NATO by sending a contingent of about  
200 troops into Kosovo last weekend, ahead of the allied 
peacekeeping force. The Russians, who are not NATO members, want to 
patrol their own section of Kosovo independent of NATO command. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've made it very clear that there cannot be a separate  
sector for Russia,'' Cohen said. He said NATO fears this would lead 
to a partitioning of the Serb province, compromising NATO's goal of 
returning all ethnic Albanian refugees to their villages. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen and Sergeyev were to be joined Thursday by Albright and  
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov. 
</P>
<P>
	If they reach an agreement it would be subject to review and  
approval by NATO's policy-making body, the North Atlantic Council. 
Cohen is scheduled to travel to NATO headquarters in Brussels, 
Belgium, on Friday to brief the allies on his Helsinki talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, who helped persuade Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic to accept NATO's demands for ending 
the war in Kosovo, said Tuesday he was confident that U.S. and 
Russian officials would settle the command issue in Helsinki. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be incomprehensible if they couldn't find  
agreement,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO and Russian generals have tried unsuccessfully for several  
days to resolve the standoff at the airport in Pristina, Kosovo's 
capital, where Russian troops are hunkered down awaiting the 
go-ahead to expand their numbers and set up a peacekeeping patrol 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Yeltsin discussed the problem by telephone in recent  
days. On Monday, they decided to put the matter in the hands of 
Cohen and Sergeyev, who have met four times previously, most 
recently in June 1998 in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense secretary said the problem, if not resolved, would  
have wide-ranging implications for U.S.-Russian relations as well 
as Russia's relations with NATO. He cited as examples the future of 
U.S.-Russian arms control and Western economic aid for Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals To Skip Painter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The beleagured St. Louis Cardinals' pitching  
staff took another hit Wednesday when left-hander Lance Painter had 
to be skipped from his next start. 
</P>
<P>
	Painter's biggest complaint after his last outing on Sunday was  
a blister on his pitching thumb that forced him out after five 
innings. He also strained his shoulder on a checked swing at the 
plate, and that's what will keep him off the mound on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The blister he could probably deal with because of where it  
is, on the side of his thumb,'' pitching coach Dave Duncan said of 
Painter, 0-4 with a 5.55 ERA. ``But we're not going to send him out 
there if his shoulder is not 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals will likely give left-hander Kent Mercker, 2-2  
with a 7.20 ERA, the start Thursday against the Mets' Al Leiter. 
Mercker was sent to the bullpen after six ineffective starts at the 
start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The scheduled starter for Thursday, Juan Acevedo, also has an  
injury to deal with. Acevedo accidentally dropped a 45-pound weight 
on his right big toe after his start on Saturday, and is being 
moved back a day to Painter's spot on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Acevedo jogged for 20 minutes after he injured himself while  
trying to place the weight on a bench, and didn't think it was a 
big deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``After I got off it I sat down for a while, then I got up to  
walk around and I realized it was bad,'' Acevedo said. ``So that's 
it. It hurts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Acevedo said the biggest concern is he's not able to push off  
the mound properly and doesn't want to alter his mechanics to 
compensate for the loss of power. He said when he had a knee injury 
last season he compensated for it and ended up hurting his elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	He's been icing the toe three times a day and is hoping one  
extra day will be enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can tolerate the pain, I'll go,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Acevedo, who began the season as the closer, is 4-1 with a 5.89  
ERA in 21 games, six of them starts. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Utility player Shawon Dunston is scheduled to have a  
hearing Friday with NL president Leonard Coleman in St. Louis on 
his three-day suspension for charging the mound in a game against 
the Los Angeles Dodgers. He's hoping to have the penalty reduced to 
two days. Dunston, who has been bothered by a hamstring problem, 
said he'll be ready to play once he's served his time. ... J.D. 
Drew's rehab assignment from a quadriceps injury at Triple-A 
Memphis ended Wednesday, but he may not be back to the Cardinals 
soon. Manager Tony La Russa said the team will probably option 
Drew, who homered Tuesday night, to Memphis to get his stroke back. 
He was batting .300 with a homer and eight RBIs in 13 games. ... 
Duncan is acting as financial adviser for his son Chris, a high 
school first baseman-outfielder who was taken on the 46th pick by 
the Cardinals. The elder Duncan said the parties were making 
progress, but were not close to a deal.

<HEADLINE> NBA Finals Finally Begin Tonight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The San Antonio Spurs have spent most of the  
past five days insisting they're not overconfident heading into the 
NBA Finals against the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	The more you listen to them, the more you wonder whether they  
really mean it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a confident team. We feel good about ourselves,'' Mario  
Elie said. ``I mean this is probably -- not disrespecting the Knicks 
-- this is probably the weakest team we're going to play in the 
playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elie has been the talkative type as everyone has waited around  
for the finals to begin, but he would not be baited into making any 
guarantees Tuesday on the eve of Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he exudes self-assurance, just like all of the Spurs, who  
enter this series with a 10-game winning streak that is just one 
short of the record set by the Los Angeles Lakers in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks entered Game 1 with a little streak of their own,  
having won the first game of their first three series in this 
year's playoffs. All three victories, against Miami, Atlanta and 
Indiana, came on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a statement for the opposing team,'' Chris Childs said.  
``Once you lose that first game at home, it changes everything you 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Latrell Sprewell: ``It's like a wake-up call, It lets them  
know we're here to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The themes of this best-of-7 series have been clearly  
established in the days since the Knicks beat Indiana in Game 6 of 
the Eastern Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks, who will definitely be without Patrick Ewing and  
could be without Larry Johnson, need to establish their running 
game to make up for their clear disadvantage in height. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, if Latrell Sprewell, Marcus Camby and Co. can't  
produce as much on the fast break as Tim Duncan and David Robinson 
can in the low post, the Knicks don't figure to stand much of a 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Patrick out, Larry is our dominant post player,''  
Sprewell said. ``And if he's gone, Marcus and Kurt Thomas are going 
to have to step up because we need a presence inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from their 10-game winning streak, the Spurs enter this  
series with a 42-6 record since the end of February. 
</P>
<P>
	They had the best regular-season record leaguewide, swept the  
second round against the Los Angeles Lakers and swept the Portland 
Trail Blazers in the Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it all came together was when we really started playing  
together as a team,'' Duncan said. ``We don't rely on any one 
person to do it for us on any given night. There's a whole lot of 
people you really have to keep an eye on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If New York chooses to double-team Duncan and Robinson in the  
low post, it'll mean that they're conceding open shots to Avery 
Johnson, Mario Elie, Sean Elliott and some of the Spurs reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the strategy most teams have used against San Antonio,  
with obviously limited results. 
</P>
<P>
	``The common strategy with Avery Johnson in particular, no  
matter where he played the last decade, was to make Avery Johnson 
beat you,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``And that's what he 
always does. People leave him open, he beats them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elliott's a former All-Star and great knockdown 3-point  
shooter with a rocket first step, and Elie's a great defender, good 
spot-up shooter and takes the ball to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to stop all of them,'' Van Gundy said.  
</P>
<P>
	Aside from stopping New York's transition game, the Spurs will  
have to contain Sprewell and Allan Houston in the kind of 
one-on-one isolation plays the Pacers had trouble stopping in Game 
6. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's status for Game 1 remains uncertain.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's still going to be a game-time decision,'' he said  
Tuesday. ``It feels better than it did yesterday. That's my 
positive sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A massage therapist is working on the knee. Johnson planned to  
test it today at the Knicks' shootaround. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even when I do come back, a bulky brace. Five, six days off,  
out of rhythm, a little bit out of shape. Tough. But this is the 
finals. There's no excuses, no lowering your head,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson has said he might play in the opener of the series. The  
possibility of playing in Friday's Game 2 ``looks a whole lot 
better'' than it did only couple of days ago, he said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Man Says He Accidentally Killed Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- A man who says he was sleepwalking when he  
stabbed his wife 44 times testified Wednesday that he loved her and 
never would have harmed her intentionally. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Falater wept as he described a near-perfect marriage to  
his wife of 20 years, Yarmila, whose body was found in the couple's 
swimming pool in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way I could do that, not intentionally,'' Falater  
said. ``I loved her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falater, 43, doesn't deny killing his wife and stashing the  
knife and his bloody clothes in his car before police arrived. He 
insists he was sleepwalking and has no memory of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Falater took the stand on the 13th day of trial and spent 1 1/2  
hours recounting how he and his wife met in high school in 
Brookfield, Ill., fell in love, married and raised two children. 
</P>
<P>
	Falater portrayed their marriage as loving and mostly free of  
arguments. He said he adored his wife, a medical technician and 
renowned basket weaver who gave up her medical career to stay home 
with their children. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was my best friend, my confidante,'' Falater said.  
</P>
<P>
	Falater dismissed the prosecution's suggestion that the couple's  
marriage was under severe strain. An electrical engineer, Falater 
also denied being unfaithful to his wife, as the prosecution 
contends. His teen-age children testified their parents had a 
loving, harmonious marriage that had never before been marred by 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution is seeking the death penalty if Falater is  
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Sleep disorder experts say it is possible for people to perform  
complex tasks -- and even kill -- while sleepwalking. 
</P>
<P>
	Two experts on sleep disorders who testified for the defense  
cited Falater's childhood history of sleepwalking, his lack of 
sleep in the days preceding the slaying and job stress as strong 
backing for his claim. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution contends Falater's sleepwalking claim is  
nonsense and that his actions were too deliberate to have been the 
work of a sleepwalker.

<HEADLINE> Elf Adjusts Offer for Saga Petroleum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- France's Elf Aquitaine extended the deadline  
and relaxed one of the conditions for its bid for Norway's Saga 
Petroleum on Wednesday, but failed to match a rival bidder's higher 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway's Norsk Hydro and the state oil company Statoil ASA have  
jointly offered about $2.56 billion in cash and stock for Norway's 
third-largest oil company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Norwegian group's bid of 135 kroner per share was 10 kroner  
more than Elf's offer, and was recommended to shareholders by the 
Saga Petroleum board on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the French energy concern extended the deadline  
for its bid by one week to June 25, two days after Norsk Hydro 
ASA's shareholders meet to vote on its offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Elf said it was also reducing its the minimum acceptance it had  
set to 50 percent of Saga's shareholders from 66.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of Saga's board, Wilhelm Wilhelmsen, resigned  
Monday to protest the takeover by the two state-controlled 
companies, which he said amounts to nationalizing Norway's main 
private oil company. He said he would sell his shares to Elf. 
</P>
<P>
	The government favors Norsk Hydro's offer because it would keep  
Saga's assets of roughly 1.5 billion barrels of oil equivalents 
under Norwegian control. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives for Saga's 1,500 employees favor the Elf bid  
because it would allow continued operation of their company.

<HEADLINE> Smits Hasn't Decided on Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Indiana Pacers center Rik Smits, bothered in  
recent years by sore feet, said today he hasn't decided whether to 
retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Smits was quoted Monday in the Dutch daily De Volkskrant as  
saying he might consider leaving the NBA because of the constant 
pain in his feet. But the 7-foot-4 native of Holland said today he 
would decide ``sometime this summer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smits brushed past reporters outside the Pacers locker room at  
Market Square Arena and refused to answer any other questions. He 
planned to meet later today team president Donnie Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
	Smits turns 33 in August. He averaged 14.9 points and 5.6  
rebounds during the regular season, his lowest marks in both 
categories since 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
	Smits has had a series of problems with his size 21 feet in  
recent years. He played most of the playoffs with a fractured big 
toe on his left foot. He suffered the injury as Indiana was 
sweeping Milwaukee in the opening round. He had an 11.8 average for 
Indiana's 13 playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	Smits had surgery to repair nerve damage in both of his feet in  
September 1996, but never completely recovered. He missed 30 games 
in the 1996-97 season and nine games in the 1997-98 season because 
of foot-related problems and had a special trainer work on the feet 
several times this season.

<HEADLINE> Francis Hired As Coyotes Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Former Boston Bruins assistant Bobby  
Francis was hired as coach of the Phoenix Coyotes on Wednesday, two 
days after news leaked that Francis would succeed the fired Jim 
Schoenfeld. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis, 40, is the third coach in the Coyotes' four seasons in  
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	The hiring was an ill-kept secret since he and the Coyotes  
settled Monday on a three-year contract believed to be worth 
$350,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The son of a former NHL coach, Francis welcomed the challenge of  
getting the team past the first round of the playoffs, something 
the franchise has failed to do in eight tries since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any good team is playing their best hockey at the end of the  
year,'' he said. ``And then you come to the playoffs, and I do 
realize that the expectations here are a little bit different, or 
else we wouldn't be standing here today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bobby Smith fired Schoenfeld on May 25, days  
after the Coyotes bowed out of a seven-game series with St. Louis 
by losing the last three games. Detroit also won the last three 
games while eliminating the Coyotes 4-2 in the 1998 postseason, 
Schoenfeld's first with Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	The firing came despite the team's 39-31-12 record and the  
second-most points (90) in franchise history. The Coyotes, fifth in 
penalty-killing, were unproductive on the power play and at even 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis said his mandate was clear.  
</P>
<P>
	``We need to generate more offense 5-on-5,'' he said. ``As I  
mentioned, we were 19th overall in goals scored last year and 26th 
in the power play. Those are two areas that we'll be able to 
improve upon. 
</P>
<P>
	``But you don't want to sacrifice the good points that this team  
possessed last year, which was the defensive play and the 
penalty-killing unit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Tortorella, Schoenfeld's top assistant, was the only other  
candidate that Smith admitted interviewing. There was speculation 
that he came off as headstrong, another reason for Schoenfeld's 
firing. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the rumors, Francis said he wouldn't live in fear of his  
boss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't be a puppet,'' he said. ``I will also tell you that I  
will utilize all the assets around me. Bobby Smith obviously has an 
abundance of knowledge. Yes, he is the person, along with (owner) 
Richard Burke, responsible for me being hired here, and I will 
utilize Bobby just as I will utilize the players around me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Francis spent the past two seasons coaching the Bruins special  
teams under coach Pat Burns. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston had the NHL's best penalty-killing unit, and its power  
play ranked eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	``He impressed me a great deal with his ideas for creating  
offense through the neutral zone, the sophistication of his game 
plan and the things that he'll be able to put in front of our 
players,'' said Smith, who acknowledged that his future could be 
tied to the next coach's success. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be pressure and tension throughout the year, but I  
feel that Bobby Francis is capable of coaching this team well and 
that he's more capable than anyone else that I considered,'' Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining Burns' staff, Francis had a 65-82-13 record in  
two seasons as coach of Providence and was 64-73-23 in two seasons 
with St. John, both of the AHL. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Emile ``The Cat'' Francis, won 277 NHL games in 13  
seasons behind the bench with the New York Rangers and St. Louis 
Blues.

<HEADLINE> Decision Pending on WTO Director </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The World Trade Organization is still deadlocked  
in the search for a new director-general despite signs of growing 
support for former New Zealand Premier Mike Moore, trade diplomats 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the 134 member countries, WTO general council  
chairman Ali Mchumo said there was still no immediate likelihood of 
a decision, and advised them to ``draw the appropriate conclusions 
and act accordingly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mchumo said 80 delegations were prepared to accept Moore -- who  
is backed by the United States and many European nations. But, in 
reference to Japan and other Asian nations, he said several members 
continued to maintain a formal objection. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also no consensus around Moore's rival, Thai deputy  
prime minister Supachai Panitchpakdi, added Mchumo. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO has been without a leader since the departure of Italian  
Renato Ruggiero at the end of April. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, many delegations are suggesting that the only  
possible option now is to drop both candidates and start the 
leadership hunt again from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a move would leave a prolonged and damaging vacuum at the  
head of the world's main trade body just as it prepares to launch a 
new set of trade liberalizing negotiations this fall in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Both candidates have vowed to stay in the race.  
</P>
<P>
	In a previous poll at the end of April, Moore had support from  
62 countries, compared with 59 for Supachai -- the longtime 
frontrunner. 
</P>
<P>
	Mchumo had convened an informal meeting of the council for  
Tuesday, but it was postponed until Wednesday. After meeting for 
four hours, the council adjourned until Friday.

<HEADLINE> Customs Head Has Heart Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Customs Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly is  
recovering from heart bypass surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The Customs Service said today that doctors at Georgetown  
University Hospital performed the bypass surgery on June 11, 
following a medical examination. 
</P>
<P>
	A former Marine and New York City police commissioner, the  
57-year-old Kelly assumed the helm of the nation's oldest 
law-enforcement agency last August. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prognosis is excellent for a full recovery,'' said a  
statement from the Customs Service. It added that Kelly is 
``recovering quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Customs official Dennis Murphy said Kelly was released from the  
hospital Wednesday and stopped by work. Kelly is setting up 
procedures to work from home, Murphy said, adding that he didn't 
know how long the commissioner will be recuperating. Sam Banks, 
Customs' deputy commissioner, will help run day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand that people who undergo heart bypass surgery  
usually have more energy when they fully recover,'' Kelly said in a 
statement. ``I always thought I kept a pretty active pace in my 
life. I'm anxious to see how much more I can do with added 
energy.''

<HEADLINE> Jacklin Last European To Win US Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Pinehurst No. 2, with it's short rough,  
wide fairways and treacherous greens, was built in the early 1900s 
by Scotsman Donald Ross. 
</P>
<P>
	But does that necessarily mean this U.S. Open will favor some of  
the Europeans, who haven't won an Open since England's Tony Jacklin 
beat Dave Hill by seven shots in 1970? 
</P>
<P>
	No way, chap.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have nothing like this in Europe,'' Lee Westwood of England  
said of the No. 2 course. ``I don't know why somebody has the 
impression it's going to suit the European player. That's just a 
proviso in case one of us wins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans don't seem to have much of a problem winning at  
the Masters, where they have captured eight of the last 12 at 
Augusta National. That includes Jose Maria Olazabal's win there 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Open has been a different story the last three decades.  
</P>
<P>
	Why?  
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal said golf courses built in Europe allow players to use  
some imagination on approach shots, sometimes running the ball 20 
or 30 yards up to the green. Most U.S. courses allow golfers to fly 
the ball high to the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``Virtually, that's the only way you can hit it close to the  
hole,'' Olazabal said of approach shots in America. 
</P>
<P>
	While No. 2 will take some imagination around the greens,  
Olazabal said it will still require a disciplined player to get 
around the course. He said that still favors the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important go from point A to point B, from point B to  
point C,'' said Olazabal, of Spain. ``The U.S. players are doing 
better at that than the Europeans. I don't think a player that just 
has the short game is suited for this course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only non-Americans to capture Open titles since Jacklin's  
victory at Hazeltine are Australian David Graham (1981) and South 
African Ernie Els (1994, 1997). 
</P>
<P>
	The best shot for the Europeans might be Colin Montgomerie, who  
lost in playoffs at the 1994 U.S. Open and the 1995 PGA 
Championship and finished second at the U.S. Open two years ago. 
The Scotsman has yet to win an official tournament on this side of 
the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Westwood, tied for sixth at The Players Championship and the  
Masters this year, points to sheer numbers when talking about the 
lack of European success. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's certainly more Americans in the field, for starters,''  
he said. ``But I think a couple of people have just been unlucky 
recently. I think (Nick) Faldo was unlucky. Monty has been unlucky. 
That's it, really.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie said the design of No. 2 open will help open the  
possibility of more players winning, including Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The advantage of the American tour is taken away on a course  
such as this,'' Montgomerie said. ``Now, we're all feeling 
uncomfortable, not just us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacklin's winning margin is the largest in the Open in the last  
29 years.

<HEADLINE> Sears Sued for Auto Repair Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sears, Roebuck and Co. faces another lawsuit  
contending its automotive business defrauded customers, the latest 
in a series of high-profile blemishes for the nation's 
second-largest retailer. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts said Wednesday they're hard-pressed to find a  
dishonest side of Sears and suggested that many of its problems 
predate a revival and revamping of the Sears corporate culture 
nearly six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A suit filed Tuesday in Madison County, Ill., contends Sears  
collected as much as $400 million from 1989 to 1994 for 
tire-balancing services it never performed, and then tried to cover 
up the fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The filing Tuesday is nearly identical to a case filed in  
Florida in 1991, but it nonetheless is one of a series of black 
marks on the company's reputation in recent years. Sears has paid 
over $100 million to settle charges it used illegal tactics to 
collect debt from bankrupt customers, sold old batteries as new and 
illegally employed minors in tasks for which they are not suited. 
</P>
<P>
	However, analyst Kurt Barnard said, ``there really doesn't  
appear to be a pattern or anything along those lines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very big retailer, so people from all walks are finding  
it a potentially fruitful target in something that kind of feeds 
upon itself as there is more press about supposed wrongdoings,'' 
said Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report. 
</P>
<P>
	The Illinois complaint resembles one filed in federal court in  
Florida in 1991 that was thrown out but reinstated by an appeals 
court last year. The court said notices that Sears sent in 1992 
about reimbursement for ``unnecessary and/or improper repairs'' 
were too vague for customers to understand. 
</P>
<P>
	Both lawsuits accuse Sears of charging 7 million to 30 million  
customers $12.50 per tire for unperformed balancing services 
through 1994, when Sears discontinued its AccuBalance service. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts who follow the company noted that most of the  
complaints against Sears are alleged to have happened before the 
tenure of chairman and chief executive officer Arthur C. Martinez, 
who is credited with revitalizing the company after taking over in 
1995. He has been with Hoffman Estates-based Sears since late 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the cases appeared to involve Sears' failure to  
properly interpret the rules rather than malicious intent, the 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the debt-collection scandal, for instance, several other  
retailers, including Federated Department Stores, also admitted 
improperly seeking so-called debt reaffirmation agreements. 
Bankrupt customers contended they were pressured into signing such 
agreements dating back to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	In the battery-selling case, it was Sears' main battery  
supplier, Exide, that had been returning old batteries to the 
retailer and marking them as new. Sears has since severed all ties 
to the Florida-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the child labor case, Labor Secretary Alexis Herman  
admitted Sears cooperated immediately when it learned managers at 
stores had trouble interpreting complicated rules on when and what 
jobs teens should be given. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears also settled charges that its auto repair shops did shoddy  
or unnecessary work between 1990 and 1992. It subsequently 
converted its auto service shops into parts dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a tough competitive environment, but I don't  
think they're doing anything bad,'' said analyst Michael Exstein at 
Credit Suisse First Boston. ``On the fundamental side of the 
business, they're always working to improve their execution and 
performance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And at the end of the day, Barnard noted, ``The thing that  
counts essentially are if consumers vote for Sears. And they do -- 
with their dollars -- because it's a first-rate, excellently run 
retail operation.''

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com To Buy Into Sotheby's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Internet superstore Amazon.com is investing  
about $45 million for a 1.7 percent stake in Sotheby's, and they 
will cooperate in developing an online auction service that will 
sell art and collectibles. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, announced today, brings together the old world and the  
new. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotheby's was founded 255 years ago and is known for its  
expensive auctions of fine art and jewelry. Amazon.com started in 
1995, and it is the leading online merchant of books, video and 
music. 
</P>
<P>
	The centerpiece of the alliance will be a jointly run Web site  
that will be called sothebys.amazon.com. It will be aimed at the 
general antiques collector and will feature everything from coins 
and stamps to toys and animation art. 
</P>
<P>
	All auction property will be offered by Sotheby's and a select  
network of dealers and other art world professionals. The 
authenticity and condition of all auctioned property will be 
guaranteed by the sellers. 
</P>
<P>
	That differs from Amazon.com's three-month-old auction business,  
where anyone can be a seller and the company will only guarantee 
purchases up to $250. Amazon will continue to operate its own 
auction site in addition to the joint site. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotheby's, meantime, will continue its plans for  
www.sothebys.com, a site set to launch this fall offering fine and 
decorative art, jewelry and books online. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the sites will be accessible by visiting Amazon.com's or  
Sotheby's home pages. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal better positions Amazon.com against rival eBay, which  
is the leading auction site on the Internet today. In April, eBay 
bought the San Francisco auction house, Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield 
Auctioneers, for $260 million. The company said the purchase of the 
privately held 134-year-old fine-arts auction house would help it 
expand into high art and items that range from $500 to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal announced today, Amazon is buying one million  
shares of Sotheby's Class A stock for about $35 million, in line 
with current market prices of about $35 a share. Amazon also has 
agreed to pay $10 million for a three-year warrant that would let 
it buy a further one million shares for $100 apiece.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Apparel Is Selling Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For a team that almost didn't make the playoffs,  
the New York Knicks' improbable run to the NBA Finals has ignited a 
buying spree for all things orange and blue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything that has a Knicks logo is hot,'' said Jim Root,  
manager of the Gerry Cosby sporting goods store outside Madison 
Square Garden. He said Tuesday that about half of all apparel sales 
of late are Knicks-related. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks, who eked into the playoffs as the eighth and final  
seed, begin the best-of-7 final series tonight in Texas against the 
San Antonio Spurs. It's New York's first trip to the finals since 
losing in seven games to the Houston Rockets in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerseys with the names of Knicks playoffs stars Latrell Sprewell  
and Allan Houston have been selling particularly well, said Root. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ran out of authentic and replica jerseys too and hope to  
have more soon,'' he said. Authentic team jerseys with a player's 
name go for about $120, compared to replica shirts which sell for 
$39. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA store in midtown Manhattan sold all of its 200 Eastern  
Conference Champions T-shirts and 100 hats within two hours of 
opening Monday, said store manager Gary Jockers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen anything like this before,'' he said. Jockers  
said Knicks apparel accounts for about 10 to 15 percent of all 
sales during the off-season, but has soared to 45 percent during 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jockers said he had ordered an additional 500 shirts and 300  
hats, which sell for $18 apiece. ``I'll be working overtime today 
and probably the rest of next week,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the street from Madison Square Garden, The Sports  
Authority clothing store has also seen strong sales of Knicks 
merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got in 300 Eastern Conference shirts on Monday and we've  
got about 30 left on the rack,'' said Monica Acevedo, a store 
manager. ``Everything's on order -- hats, shirts, jerseys, you name 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the Knicks have been underdogs throughout their  
postseason run, Pro Player sports apparel was ready for the 
unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments after winning the Eastern Conference title by beating  
the Indiana Pacers, Knicks players donned jerseys and caps 
proclaiming their championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro Player had its production people at machines, ready to go if  
the Knicks won Game 6. When Sprewell made his last basket, assuring 
the victory, the go ahead was given, and within hours the jerseys 
and caps were in retail outlets in the New York area. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the game tonight is being played in San Antonio, fans  
wishing to plunk down $17 ($15 for the ticket and a $2 facility 
surcharge) can watch the game at Madison Square Garden on its 
``GardenVision'' screens. Proceeds from the admission fee are to go 
to charity.

	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Former Gov. Jack M. Campbell, a Democrat  
who served two terms in the 1960s, died Monday. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell was governor from 1963 to 1966, enforcing a nonpartisan  
civil service for state employees and modernizing services for the 
mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the first New Mexico governor to appoint a science

<P>
	Connor began as a reporter and photographer at The Daily News  
before World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to newspaper work after the war, covering city hall

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Henry Grunfeld, a refugee from Nazi Germany who  
helped build S.G. Warburg into one of the most successful British 
financial enterprises of the post-World War II period, died 
Thursday. He was 95. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1935, Grunfeld teamed with fellow German Jew and Nazi refugee  
Siegmund Warburg to establish the investment banking house that 
eventually became known as S.G. Warburg. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men formed the New Trading Co., which changed its name  
to S.G. Warburg in 1946. Their long association ended only with 
Warburg's death in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunfeld became chairman of the firm when Warburg retired in  
1964. He retired as chairman in 1974, but held the office of 
president until 1995, when the firm was acquired by Swiss Bank. He 
stayed on as senior adviser until his death.

	HAMILTON, Ontario (AP) -- Bernie Faloney, the former University  
of Maryland star who guided the Hamilton Tiger-Cats to seven Grey 
Cup appearances in eight years, died Monday. He was 66. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian Football Hall of Fame quarterback was diagnosed  
last year with terminal colon cancer that had spread to his liver. 
In 1996, Faloney underwent successful prostate cancer surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Faloney led Maryland to the national championship in 1953.  
Though he was a first-round pick of the NFL's San Francisco 49ers, 
Faloney headed north, signing with the Edmonton Eskimos in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	After a stint in the U.S. Air Force, Faloney returned to the  
league in 1957, guiding the Tiger-Cats to two Grey Cup wins. In 
1961, he was named the league's outstanding player. He went to 
Montreal in 1965 and ended his career two years later with the B.C. 
Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	Faloney will be inducted posthumously into the Canadian Sports  
Hall of Fame on Oct. 6. He was inducted into the Canadian Football 
Hall of Fame in 1974.

	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Dolores Jimenez Alcantara, one of  
flamenco's leading singers, better known as ``La Nina de la 
Puebla'' (The Girl from Puebla), died Monday. She was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	She suffered a brain hemorrhage during a performance last  
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The singer was given her stage name in recognition of her  
birthplace, Puebla de Cazalla, just outside Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	Blind from childhood, Jimenez dedicated herself to music from  
her early years and in the 1960s and 1970s captured the hearts of 
flamenco artists and fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Admired for her ability to sing in a wide range of flamenco  
styles, she was probably best known for popularizing the Spanish 
traditional song ``Los campanilleros'' (The Bell Ringers). 
</P>
<P>
	She was to have received Spain's Gold Medal for Fine Arts from  
King Juan Carlos next week.

	COLLEGEVILLE, Minn. (AP) -- J.F. Powers, a celebrated Catholic  
writer and winner of the 1963 National Book Award for his novel 
``Morte D'Urban,'' died Monday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Powers was a writer in residence and an English professor at St.  
John's University and the College of St. Benedict from 1975 to 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Powers wrote three collections of short fiction along with his  
1962 novel ``Morte D'Urban'' and 1988 novel ``Wheat That Springeth 
Green,'' for which he was a National Book Award finalist. 
</P>
<P>
	Both novels follow the careers of a Minnesota priest, and much  
of his writing dealt with the conflict between spiritual and 
secular values in a materialistic society. 
</P>
<P>
	Powers also contributed regularly to The New Yorker and received  
fellowships from the Rockefeller and Guggenheim foundations.

<HEADLINE> Virenque Barred From Tour de France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Tour de France organizers today barred Richard  
Virenque, the top French cyclist implicated in last year's doping 
scandal, from this year's event. 
</P>
<P>
	The Polti cyclist is ``not welcome'' this year because ``his  
presence would be incompatible with the image of the Tour, and the 
one we want to preserve,'' race director Jean-Marie Leblanc said. 
</P>
<P>
	Virenque is still under formal investigation by French  
authorities following the Festina doping scandal at last year's 
Tour that is still overshadowing the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers also expelled Casino's Laurent Roux and Cofidis'  
Philippe Gaumont, two riders under suspension from their teams. 
However, other cyclists from Casino, Cofidis and Polti are free to 
enter the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the TVM team has been banned in its entirety and Spanish  
team ONCE is free to enter, but without its sporting director 
Manolo Saiz and its doctor Nicolas Terrados. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban on Virenque, a former runnerup in the race, is the most  
notable decision. While several of his Festina colleagues admitted 
to drug usage, he has always denied knowingly taking banned 
substances. 
</P>
<P>
	``Richard Virenque epitomizes, in his name, in his image, the  
doping phenomenon, whether or not he is responsible for the 
situation,'' Leblanc said. 
</P>
<P>
	Virenque quit the sport last year after Festina canceled his  
contract and he was unable to find a new team. 
</P>
<P>
	But in January, the Italian Polti team offered him a two-year  
deal. After signing up with Polti, Virenque said he was looking 
forward to competing in the Tour.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Surfaces in Medical Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Popular legislation protecting the privacy of  
medical records is being held up in part by a much stickier issue: 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., is trying to find common ground, but  
he's frustrated that the abortion issue is making it difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``It always comes up. Whenever there's a way, it shows up,''  
said Jeffords, who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and 
Pensions committee, which had hoped to finish work on the bill this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is whether the new rights to medical privacy extend to  
children who might want to keep the information from their parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the best of situations, parents can comfort and guide  
teen-agers struggling with mental or physical health issues. In 
other cases, a teen may not be comfortable or safe in sharing his 
or her concerns,'' said Jim Manley, spokesman for Sen. Edward 
Kennedy, D-Mass., who is leading Democrats on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., argues that parents have a right to  
know what's going on with their children. 
</P>
<P>
	``The federal government should not undermine the family unit by  
giving children the ability to exclude parents from health care 
decisions,'' he said in statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The heart of the legislation -- establishing the federal right to  
privacy of medical records -- has widespread support. In addition to 
children's rights, senators have one other controversy to resolve -- 
over who can sue if privacy rights are violated. 
</P>
<P>
	All sides agree that the legislation should not alter state  
laws. More than half the states require parental consent or 
notification when teen-agers seek abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	But most states allow teens to seek certain types of care on  
their own, including contraception, drug treatment and mental 
health treatment. The question is whether they have the right to 
keep records of those visits from their parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Also at issue was what rights the federal law might create for  
teens in states that have no abortion notification or other privacy 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Abortion opponents, led by Brownback, want to maintain the  
status quo, with minors having no rights to keep any medical 
records private. 
</P>
<P>
	But abortion rights supporters, led by Kennedy, are pushing to  
apply the new rights to minors as well as adults -- as long as no 
state law says otherwise. If the children in a particular state are 
allowed to get medical care on their own, Kennedy argues, they 
should be allowed to keep those records private. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords personally supports a woman's right to choose abortion,  
but doesn't want to lose the support of his GOP colleagues. He has 
canceled four scheduled committee votes on the medical privacy 
bill, hoping the differences can be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confident we'll find a way around the controversy,''  
Jeffords said Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Compaq Announces Lower-Cost PC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp., firing a salvo in the  
low-cost PC market, unveiled a basic Presario PC that will sell for 
$599, $100 less than the company's current entry-level model. 
</P>
<P>
	The self-described ``barebones'' Presario 5300 line was among  
the two new lines of desktop computers announced Tuesday along with 
a new notebook series and new models for three current notebook 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	All new Compaq Presario products will be bundled with Internet  
access software for three services, including the company's new 
Compaq.net, a network with more than 700 local access phone 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the Houston computer maker's entry-level PC will be  
reduced to $599 and it will be offered in a package that includes a 
printer and monitor for less than $899. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq.net will be offered at less than $12 a month for  
unlimited access. Compaq PCs will also be equipped with software 
for America Online Inc. and NetZero Inc., a free, 
advertising-supported service. 
</P>
<P>
	New keyboards will add seven new keys to direct Internet  
functions, including an instant e-mail button and an instant search 
button which will link to the Alta Vista Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The Compaq Home Phoneline Networking technology will be standard  
on many models. The system enables several family members to access 
the Web at the same using one phone line and one Internet account. 
</P>
<P>
	Some new models will also support broadband Internet access,  
allowing consumers to choose ultra-fast cable, DSL or traditional 
phone line connections. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Tuesday, Dell Computer Corp., based in Round Rock,  
Texas, introduced its low-cost Dimension L series PC for $899, 
which includes a monitor and software package.

<HEADLINE> Good Samaritans To Receive Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Like many other Americans, Dr. Ramona Tascoe  
was horrified by the carnage when two U.S. embassies in East Africa 
were bombed last August. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tascoe was not satisfied to watch from continents away, even  
after the State Department rejected her offer to assemble a 
delegation of physicians and travel to Kenya and Tanzania. Instead, 
she tapped several willing donors and in less than two weeks was on 
her way with a private group of doctors and $300,000 worth of 
medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Tascoe will join 40 other private citizens in Washington on  
Friday to receive the Jefferson Awards for contribution to public 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt it was important for the Kenyans to know there were  
Americans who were hurting because of their pain,'' said Tascoe, a 
San Francisco resident and a faculty member at the University of 
California at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	She helped treat some 5,000 people injured by the blasts,  
looking for both physical and emotional scarring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had anticipated on making one trip,'' the doctor said.  
Instead, she has been back to Nairobi seven times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so well-received. There was such a hunger for someone  
from the U.S. to offer a degree of compassion that was genuine,'' 
Tascoe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsored by the American Institute for Public Service, the  
annual awards draw attention to individuals who through their 
personal -- and often ingenious -- efforts have tried to improve the 
lives of others. 
</P>
<P>
	When 18-year-old Jean-Dominique Catchings of Winter Park, Fla.,  
was attacked four years ago by seven young men fulfilling a gang 
initiation rite, he decided to focus on solutions rather than 
revenge. 
</P>
<P>
	He set up the Speak Out Hotline Program, which enables youths to  
report potential crimes or dangerous situations, without fear of 
retribution. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the biggest problems is that teens have information but  
are scared to speak out,'' said Catchings, nicknamed Jo-Jo. The 
hotline has received a number of calls from students reporting 
sightings of weapons on school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Catchings also began a singing group, Chivalry, which focuses on  
using non-violent and non-vulgar lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just had to take what happened to me and turn it toward  
something positive,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several award recipients said they were drawn into public  
service by formative moments in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. William Magee Jr., a plastic surgeon in Norfolk, Va.,  
traveled to the Philippines in 1981 to operate on children with 
cleft lips and other facial deformities. There were so many 
children with the deformity, which can render it impossible for 
them to speak or eat, that hundreds had to be turned away. 
</P>
<P>
	Magee and his wife then founded Operation Smile, an organization  
which sends volunteer doctors to perform the reconstructive facial 
surgery for children worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a strategic plan,'' said Magee. ``It was just a  
matter of emotion and passion to make sure children didn't have to 
live this way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group, which already has treated 50,000 children worldwide,  
also trains doctors in other nations to perform the procedure. 
Magee hopes to use satellite technology in the future, so he can 
teach a greater number of medical professionals the necessary 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	Four national figures also are being recognized for their  
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., will be honored for his  
work on Social Security and welfare reform; presidential contender 
Elizabeth Dole for her leadership of the American Red Cross; 
Millard Fuller, founder of Habitat for Humanity International, for 
establishing an organization that builds homes for the poor, and; 
Anthony Kennedy Shriver, for heading Best Buddies International, a 
group that works with mentally disabled youth. 
</P>
<P>
	Nominations are solicited by newspapers and television stations  
that ultimately determine the finalists. The service institute was 
founded in 1972 by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, former Sen. Robert 
Taft Jr. and Sam Beard.

<HEADLINE> Region-by-Region Economic Outlook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Summaries of regional economic conditions before June 7,  
compiled by the 12 regional banks of the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON -- The ... economy continues to expand. Retailers report  
strong sales growth while manufacturers' results are mixed. ... 
Business continues to grow at temporary employment firms and 
insurance companies and in most of the region's commercial real 
estate markets. Retailers report prices are mostly steady. Most 
workers' pay increases are in the 3 to 5 percent range. 
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK -- The ... economy continues to expand, though at a  
somewhat slower pace than in the last report. While there are 
scattered reports of upward price pressures, they appear to remain 
relatively subdued. Most retailers report that sales were up 
despite unseasonably cool weather, which held down sales of summer 
merchandise. Residential real estate markets remain strong, though 
activity appears to have leveled off in the second quarter, largely 
due to supply constraints. Prices for homes sold in early 1999 rose 
an average of 11-12 percent, reflecting sharp rises in land prices 
due to shortages of available land. 
</P>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA -- Business activity ... continued to increase in  
May. Manufacturing in most of the region's major industrial sectors 
reported further gains in shipments and orders. Retailers and auto 
dealers posted higher sales in May than in April. Bankers indicated 
that demand for business loans was on the increase and real estate 
lending remained high. Consumer lending was rising ... although 
some banks noted flat or falling personal lending. Real estate 
markets have been active. Home sales have been increasing and 
commercial real estate leasing has been strong. 
</P>
<P>
	CLEVELAND -- The ... economy is still quite strong, and worker  
shortages remain a concern for many companies. Many employment 
agencies have recently increased wages for a variety of positions. 
The largest wage hikes are for administrative assistants. Virtually 
every amusement park is understaffed and some companies are said to 
be paring down operations. ... Labor and material shortages 
continue to plague homebuilders. ... Retailers report very strong 
sales numbers in May and tight labor market conditions. 
Manufacturing activity is good overall. 
</P>
<P>
	RICHMOND -- The ... economy continued to advance at a rapid clip  
in late April and May. Business services and financial firms 
reported stronger demand and retailers noted continued strength in 
auto and housing-related sales. Manufacturers continued to increase 
output. ... The real estate sector remained upbeat, housing sales 
were brisk and commercial activity was strong in Virginia and the 
Carolinas. Bank lending remained strong although higher interest 
rates slowed the pace of mortgage refinancings. Labor markets 
tightened further and wages rose somewhat faster in the retail and 
service sectors, but prices increased only moderately. ... Dry 
weather hampered spring planting and crop development in many 
areas... 
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA -- Moderate growth continues in the Southeast. Merchants  
report that sales have generally met expectations. ... The tourism 
and hospitality sector continues to post strong numbers. 
Residential building and sales have slackened from high levels and 
the longer-term outlook has weakened. Commercial construction 
remains healthy. ... Factory production has been mixed. ... Labor 
markets remain tight as employers search for scarce workers, but 
reports of accelerating wage pressures are mostly limited to 
high-tech workers. Prices remain stable. 
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO -- The ... economy continued to expand at a modest pace  
in May and early June. ... Home sales and light vehicle sales led 
strong consumer spending. ... Construction activity continued very 
strong even as labor and building materials shortages slowed some 
projects. Manufacturing activity was robust with motor vehicles and 
construction industries running near capacity while steel and 
agricultural equipment producers continued to struggle. Despite a 
sharp dropoff in home refinancings, overall lending remained 
strong. Labor markets were again tighter ... than the nation as a 
whole ... reports of worker shortages and intensifying wage 
pressures became more widespread. 
</P>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS -- The economy ... continues to exhibit strong growth.  
Retail sales were up between 4 and 5 percent from a year earlier. 
... Auto and light truck sales were not as brisk. ... Manufacturers 
and other businesses continue to report growth in demand, which in 
some instances they can't meet because of persistent labor 
shortages. Signs of growing upward wage pressures are emerging. ... 
Residential real estate continues to boom ... while strong demand 
and shortages of available homes are driving up prices in some 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS -- The overall ... economy continues to expand,  
although natural resource-based industries are still struggling. 
The economy remains robust for construction, consumer spending and 
manufacturing. ... Low commodity prices persist in depressing farm 
income and curbing metal mining. ... Labor markets remain tight and 
in some cases businesses are paying more to retain workers. 
</P>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY -- The economy ... remained solid in May but appears  
to have slowed from the rapid growth of recent years. Extremely 
tight labor markets ... may be contributing to the slowdown. Retail 
activity slowed ... and construction also cooled. ... In contrast 
manufacturing activity improved considerably from the sluggish 
conditions experienced in the past. ... In the farm economy, the 
winter wheat crop remained in good condition, but losses continued 
for many livestock producers. Although labor markets remained very 
tight, wages pressured eased somewhat. ... Retail prices continued 
to edge up as did prices for construction materials. 
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS -- The economy in May and the first week of June continued  
to expand at roughly the same pace reported in March and April. ... 
Most business service firms continued to report strong activity and 
retailers said sales growth was strong. Higher building costs and 
strong demand have pushed new homes prices up 5 percent to 7 
percent over the past year. ... In the service sector, hiring 
remains difficult and wages are up for truckers, secretaries, legal 
assistant and workers with technical skills. ... Energy activity 
has not increased with higher oil prices, although there is 
increased optimism about the second half of this year because 
producers expect the number of wells being drilled to increase. 
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO -- Robust economic conditions. ... Sales were brisk  
for retailers and providers of services to businesses and 
consumers. ... Autos and light trucks sold at a good clip in most 
areas and prices were flat or declined a bit. ... By product, the 
strongest sales were reported for home furnishings and home 
electronic items ... demand was strong for communications and 
utility services. Manufacturing activity proceeded at a moderate 
pace. ... Conditions in the agricultural sector were somewhat weak. 
Activity in real estate and construction markets remained at high 
levels in most areas and financial institutions reported strong 
demand for credit. Wages and prices exhibited limited movement 
overall, although increases were noted for some types of workers 
and products.

	 *Breakout:* When ``Heart Shaped World'' -- which included the  
single ``Wicked Game'' -- was released in 1989, one reviewer noted: 
``Isaak seems to have a great song for every woman who has jilted 
him, and on ``Heart Shaped World,'' that's an album full.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But ``Wicked Game'' and the album were two years old and nearly  
forgotten when an instrumental track of the song appeared in David 
Lynch's movie, ``Wild at Heart.'' The music director of an Atlanta 
radio station heard the music, searched out Isaak's version and 
started playing the song. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Other albums:* ``Silvertone,'' ``Chris Isaak,'' ``San Francisco  
Days,'' ``Forever Blue,'' ``Baja Sessions'' and ``Speak of the 
Devil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *Film roles:* Isaak has appeared in ``Married to the Mob,''  
``Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me,'' ``Little Buddha,'' ``Silence of 
the Lambs,'' ``That Thing You Do'' and ``Grace of My Heart.'' He is 
currently cast as a Southern sheriff in ``Shepherd,'' directed by 
James Rowe.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Criticizes Childcare Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Despite a blockbuster economy, poor children  
have fared no better under the Clinton administration than they did 
under Republican presidents, presidential hopeful Bill Bradley said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``After seven years of the first two-term Democratic  
administration since Franklin Roosevelt, the percentage of American 
children living in poverty has barely changed,'' Bradley told a 
group at Para Los Ninos, a non-profit day care center in an 
impoverished downtown neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	On the fifth day of a nine-day swing through California, the  
former NBA star and New Jersey senator never uttered the name of 
Vice President Al Gore, his rival for the Democratic presidential 
nomination next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley is Gore's only Democratic competitor. A poll released  
Wednesday by the Los Angeles Times showed Gore could handily win 
the party's California primary next March. Gore was leading Bradley 
56 percent to 26 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll surveyed 1,602 Californians by telephone June 10-14.  
There were 1,179 registered voters, including 540 Democrats and 391 
Republicans. The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley vowed to raise the minimum wage, expand the earned  
income tax credit, and improve the access and quality of day care. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two-thirds of our children experience parental care as a  
hurried effort between too much work and too little sleep,'' 
Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``... The people in this Democratic administration have been  
looking at the same grim statistics of child poverty for a long 
time,'' he said. ``But what have they done? They've tinkered around 
the margins.''

<HEADLINE> 'Pals' Charged With Killing Friend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PANAMA CITY, Fla. (AP) -- Three men are accused of killing their  
friend on his birthday for not giving them his ATM card's 
identification number. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of Michael Sawyer, a construction worker from  
Alamagordo, N.M., was discovered Tuesday morning in woods by a 
bayou outside Panama City. 
</P>
<P>
	Several fingers and one arm were broken and investigators said  
Sawyer was stabbed in the leg and superficially cut across the 
throat with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they believe the three suspects grew  
infuriated as Sawyer kept giving them different PIN numbers for his 
bank card. They eventually fatally stabbed him in the midsection. 
</P>
<P>
	Charged with first-degree murder is Herbert Otis Langford, 32;  
Tommy Jene Turner Jr., 18; and John W. Duffield, 18. Each was 
denied bail. 
</P>
<P>
	The three defendants helped Sawyer, who sold T-shirts on the  
beach in summer at Panama City, celebrate his 22nd birthday Sunday 
night before turning on him, police said.

<HEADLINE> Indian Tribes Sue Tobacco Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- With a poster-sized drawing of a  
laughing Joe Camel in an Indian headdress as the backdrop, tribal 
leaders announced Wednesday they had filed a multibillion-dollar 
lawsuit against the nation's biggest tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-four tribes with 450,000 members filed the lawsuit in  
state court in Santa Fe against Big Tobacco, mirroring the cases 
filed by states and foreign governments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians seek billions of dollars in damages as compensation  
for health care costs and for anti-smoking education programs. The 
tribes, which use tobacco for ceremonies, accuse the companies of 
manipulating the nicotine levels in cigarettes to lead to 
addiction. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit also contends the tobacco industry directs  
advertising at Indian youths. Harold Salway, president of the 
Ogalala Sioux, said he was insulted by one such ad, the one with 
Joe Camel wearing a traditional headdress. 
</P>
<P>
	``The headdress symbolizes leadership,'' Salway said. ``I'm sure  
the Presidential seal of the United States would not be utilized to 
market a devastating material like tobacco.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris attorney Michael York said it is absurd to suggest  
Indians are persuaded to smoke by advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	``The allegation is illogical on its face because the plaintiffs  
would literally have to bring a Native American witness into court 
who said he or she decided to smoke because of something the 
tobacco companies said in an advertisement,'' York said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for R.J. Reynolds, the maker of Camel cigarettes,  
did not return messages for comment. Another company named in the 
lawsuit, the Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Co., makers of American 
Spirit cigarettes, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's Indian tribes were not included in a settlement  
between the tobacco industry and 46 states in November. In that 
settlement, the tobacco industry agreed to pay a total of $206 
billion to 46 states that sued to recover Medicaid costs for 
smoking-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 40 percent of Indians smoke, according to the Surgeon  
General. That compares to nearly 27 percent of blacks and whites, 
19 percent of Hispanics and 15 percent of Asian-Americans.

<HEADLINE>  Quake Damages Buildings in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PUEBLA, Mexico (AP) -- An earthquake destroyed homes, toppled  
church towers and damaged other colonial-era buildings in central 
Mexico, killing at least 15 people and injuring hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
	President Ernesto Zedillo declared the state of Puebla a  
disaster area after the magnitude 6.7 earthquake struck Tuesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt very strong. It was a jumping movement,'' said  
Raimundo Villas, 20, an industrial engineer, who described how a 
chunk of falling cornice crushed one man in the city of Puebla, 60 
miles east of Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico's National Seismological Service said the earthquake was  
centered near Huajuapan de Leon, 80 miles south of Puebla. The U.S. 
Geological Survey calculated the epicenter at 70 miles southeast of 
here, near the city of Tehuacan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we have been relatively lucky, although we always  
must regret losses,'' Zedillo told reporters late Tuesday outside 
the San Agustin church in Puebla. The church's tower collapsed in 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico City, where two people died, had relatively little  
damage, but tall buildings swayed with the quake, sending tens of 
thousands of panicked people into the streets. Telephone service 
and power were disrupted in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Puebla state Gov. Melquiades Morales Flores told reporters that  
at least 11 people died in the state. Veracruz state officials said 
a workman was killed in a rockslide in Huatuzco. One person was 
killed in the western state of Guerrero, the Interior Ministry 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake took a heavy toll on the colonial-era buildings for  
which Puebla, a city of 1.2 million people, is famed. While most 
basic structures stood up well, cupolas, towers and cornices often 
cracked, and some crashed to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	But modern buildings also were damaged. In a block of three  
four-story apartment buildings, one collapsed completely, the 
bottom two floors collapsed in another, while the third was only 
cracked. Soldiers said they pulled residents from the wreckage and 
no one was killed or injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of troops patrolled streets strewn with rubble and  
glass early today, helping in rescue and cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	Some residents took matters into their own hands Tuesday.  
Outside the La Soledad church, with a cracked and leaning 
100-foot-high bell tower, residents roped off the street to block 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Heavy trucks pass, and the way they shake, they are going to  
send this bell tower down onto the houses,'' said Rodolfo 
Hernandez, a 33-year-old mechanic tending to the ropes under a 
driving rain. 
</P>
<P>
	On the city's main square, a backhoe roared in and out of the  
centuries-old city hall late Tuesday, filling trucks with debris 
from interior ceilings that collapsed. Four people were rescued 
from the building. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe, we hope that there is no one in there,'' said city  
manager Pericles Olivares, who walked through the streets 
inspecting damage. 
</P>
<P>
	A few blocks away, peering up at a wide crack that snaked  
through a 10-story concrete office building, Olivares ordered the 
entire city block evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Alejandro Soto, director of the Puebla Red Cross, said 200  
people suffered at least minor injuries and 10 were seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Hector Gonzalez, civil defense director of Huajuapan de Leon, a  
city of 200,000 people, said the quake knocked out electricity and 
telephone service, but no injuries or major damage was reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cuernavaca, 35 miles south of Mexico City, the cupola of the  
16th century cathedral partially collapsed, but officials reported 
no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	In Teposcolula, the city hall partially collapsed, two houses  
fell and the main church was damaged, according to Sergio 
Hampshire, the civil defense director for Oaxaca state. There were 
no reports of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico's largest recent earthquake, on Sept. 19, 1985, was  
recorded at magnitude 8.1 and killed more than 6,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Feds To Examine Spread of AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Federal health experts are being sent to major U.S.  
cities beginning this month to examine the disproportionate spread 
of AIDS and HIV in people of color, especially among blacks, The 
Miami Herald reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The team will look at factors that have played a role in the  
disease's spread in certain cities to see what should be changed in 
the approach taken by local health officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami, Philadelphia and Detroit are the first of 11 cities  
chosen for the review and will be visited this month. The plan was 
to be formally announced today in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, Miami has the third-highest rate of AIDS infections.  
Last year, blacks accounted for nearly half of all the AIDS cases 
among men in Florida and three-quarters of the women. 
</P>
<P>
	For whites and Hispanics the news is less grim but still cause  
for concern. Last year, Hispanics accounted for 33 percent of all 
AIDS cases in Florida, and 28 percent of HIV infections. For 
whites, it's 18 percent and 13 percent, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``With some of the best minds in the country helping us, we can  
wage a tough battle on this epidemic,'' said Rep. Carrie Meek, 
D-Fla. ``While other areas of the country are getting healthier, 
our community is getting sicker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The formation of the crisis response teams could signal a shift  
in how prevention and treatment messages are spread and implemented 
since information campaigns about AIDS largely have been targeted 
toward gay, white males. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Clinton administration committed $156 million  
specifically to fight AIDS in black communities nationwide. That 
money is paying for the crisis response teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Team members will come from agencies that include the Centers  
for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of 
Health. They will visit each city for eight to 10 weeks and meet 
with organizations that work with minorities living with HIV and 
AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Japan's TV Nets To Reduce Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese television broadcasters may stop airing  
shows heavy on sex and violence during evening hours when children 
are likely to be watching. 
</P>
<P>
	The broadcasters are considering a set of guidelines under which  
they would pledge to refrain from airing programs they consider 
inappropriate for children. 
</P>
<P>
	Those are broadly defined as shows containing ``excessive  
violence'' or ``adult language'' between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m., an 
official from Japan's National Association of Commercial 
Broadcasters said Wednesday. He spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines would be the first effort in Japan to designate a  
special viewing time for children. 
</P>
<P>
	Children 12-years-old or younger account for more than 10  
percent of viewers between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m., the group said. 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines would not, however, specify what would make a  
show inappropriate for children. Instead, each TV station would 
decide on its own what shows are acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, prime-time television dramas often contain steamy love  
scenes, and nudity is common on late-night TV. 
</P>
<P>
	A television drama in which a popular actor often wielded a  
knife was blamed for inspiring a spate of juvenile crimes involving 
knives early last year.

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com, Sotheby's Offer Auctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amazon.com's online auctions will still handle  
Pokemon cards and Sotheby's will still offer Monets. But the two 
sellers said Wednesday they're teaming up to sell sports 
memorabilia, coins, and other collectibles on a new Web site called 
sothebys.amazon.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was made by Amazon.com's founder, Jeff Bezos, a  
guy who never wears a tie, and Sotheby's CEO Diana D. Brooks, 
impeccably dressed in a pink suit, pearls and black pumps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are a very traditional company,'' acknowledged Mrs. Brooks.  
But she added that the world is ``changing so fast we thought we 
ought to be partnered up with the best Internet company there is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bezos also announced that Amazon.com Inc. is investing $45  
million in Sotheby's. The stocks of both companies soared in a 
sharply rising market after the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Bezos said his 5-year-old company could learn from the auction  
house that was founded in 1744 and still lists among its highlights 
the sale of Napoleon's library in 1811. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we'll learn how we get to be an important lasting  
franchise too,'' Bezos said. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint venture will kick off in September with an on-line  
sale of rare baseball cards, some of which will also be sold at a 
live auction at Sotheby's galleries on Manhattan's Upper East Side. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotheby's Holdings Inc. is also proceeding with plans to launch  
a separate Web site in the fall, sothebys.com. The main difference 
between the sites will be the type of object offered, rather than 
their dollar value. 
</P>
<P>
	All coins, stamps, baseball cards, entertainment memorabilia,  
fashion and other common collectibles -- whether they are worth a 
few hundred or a few thousand dollars -- will be sold at 
sotheby's.amazon.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now turn away hundreds of thousands of objects a year  
around the world. This is going to enable us to handle more of 
those objects,'' Mrs. Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fine art, rare antiques and the like will be kept on the  
sothebys.com site. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon will also maintain its own auction site, Amazon.com. But  
that venue will be open to any seller and is expected to attract 
more mundane offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beanie Babies will continue on Amazon.com, and Pokemon  
cards,'' Mrs. Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Sotheby's and its authorized dealers around the world will  
be able to sell on either the sothebys.com site or the joint site. 
And all purchases made on either site will be guaranteed for 
authenticity and condition, while Amazon.com guarantees purchases 
only up to $250. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the sites will be accessible by visiting Amazon.com's or  
Sotheby's home pages. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal better positions Amazon against its rival in the  
auction business, eBay, which is the Internet's leading auction 
site. In April, eBay bought the San Francisco auction house, 
Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield, to help expand its offering into high 
art and more expensive items. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Westly, eBay's vice president of marketing and business,  
said his company isn't spooked by the new competition. ``We're 
already successful,'' he said. ``We have the momentum. We have the 
audience. We fully expect to be the leaders in this space.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Competition on the high end will also come from Christie's,  
another world-class auction house that will soon launch a Web site. 
Christie's spokeswoman Andree Corroon described it as a ``virtual 
sale room for our firm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sotheby's-Amazon deal announced Wednesday includes Amazon's  
purchase of a million shares of Sotheby's Class A stock for about 
$35 million, in line with prices of about $35 a share before the 
announcement. Amazon also agreed to pay $10 million for a 
three-year warrant that would let it buy another million shares in 
Sotheby's for $100 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Wednesday, Amazon.com stock shot up almost 16  
percent, or by $15.18 3/4, to $111.68 3/4 a share on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market, while Southeby's climbed almost 12 percent, or by $4.12 1/2, 
to $39.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon, based in Seattle, will be in charge of technology and  
customer service for the new joint site, while Sotheby's determines 
what's for sale along with such editorial content such as tips for 
buying and directories of dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Brooks and Bezos refused to comment on how profits will be  
split or dealers' commissions will be set. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotheby's largest shareholder, Ron Baron, who owns 25 percent of  
the company's stock and has his own mutual fund, called the new Web 
site a ``marriage made in heaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The opportunity Sotheby's has to provide authentication and  
for Amazon to provide technology and clients is a terrific 
combination,'' he said.

	Refugees Head Home to Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Ignoring warnings from aid workers  
and NATO, thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees streamed north into 
Kosovo today, encouraged by a peacekeeping mission that despite 
pockets of resistance seemed to be moving smoothly. As they crowded 
in from the south and west, the roads leading out of Kosovo were 
packed with Serbs -- Yugoslav soldiers departing under terms of the 
peace deal and civilians afraid of retaliatory attacks. Hundreds of 
Kosovo Liberation Army rebels emerged from the woods and joined the 
refugees, staging a show of strength in an armed march through a 
major town.

	3rd Russian Supply Convoy in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia sent a third military supply convoy into  
Kosovo today even as Moscow claimed it wanted to solve a dispute 
with NATO over who was in charge of peacekeeping operations there. 
A Defense Ministry spokesman, who declined to be named, said a 
convoy of nine vehicles had passed into Kosovo this morning, 
heading for the Russian force holding the airport near the capital, 
Pristina. The convoy was carrying supplies, but the spokesman 
refused to comment further. The Russians sent an earlier supply 
column to Pristina yesterday, raising tensions with NATO, which 
insists it commands all peacekeeping operations in Kosovo. Russia 
has said it won't accept NATO command over its forces.

administration's economic, education and environmental policies 
``will prove to be a very successful platform'' for Gore's

International Labor Organization, becoming the first U.S. president 
to address the group. Clinton is in Europe on a visit where the 
agenda is dominated by peacekeeping in Kosovo and economic 
agreements among the industrial powers on an overhaul of Europe's 
financial systems and debt relief for the world's poorest nations. 
After his overnight flight, the president met privately with Swiss 
President Ruth Dreifuss to discuss humanitarian aid to the ethnic 
Albanian refugees who fled Kosovo and reconstruction of the Serbian 
province.

	Pope Resumes Trip After Having Flu  
</P>
<P>
	STARY SACZ, Poland (AP) -- Feeling better today after a touch of  
flu, Pope John Paul II greeted hundreds of thousands of relieved 
faithful, who cheered ``Long live the pope!'' as he resumed his 
pilgrimage to Poland. Still, after canceling all his public 
appearances and staying in bed yesterday, the frail, 79-year-old 
pope decided to drop a last-minute trip to Armenia planned for 
Friday. About 700,000 people welcomed John Paul in Stary Sacz, a 
southern tourist center in the mountains outside Krakow. The Pope 
sounded healthier during the Mass than in his last speech Monday 
night. But his left side was shaking noticeably.

	Consumer Prices Unchanged in May  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer prices held steady in May following  
an April jump that was the largest in nearly nine years. Falling 
energy prices balanced rising food costs to help keep the Consumer 
Price Index flat last month, the Commerce Department said today. 
Core prices -- which exclude the volatile energy and food categories 
and are the most closely watched by economists -- rose a modest 0.1 
percent as clothing and auto prices declined and medical and 
housing costs edged up.

annual rate.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Disability-to-Work Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After months of delay, the Senate voted 99-0  
Wednesday to make it easier for people with disabilities to return 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
	The centerpiece of the bill would allow many of the nation's 9  
million adults with disabilities to retain their health insurance 
when they take jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If America means anything, it means not leaving people out or  
people behind,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who helped 
spearhead the bill. He called it a ``real invitation'' to people 
with disabilities to ``be part of the American dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy and Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., joined disability  
activists for hugs, cheers and snapshots after the vote. The 
gathering off the Senate floor was part celebration and part relief 
that the bill had finally come up for a vote after months of delay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you how thrilled I am,'' Jeffords said.  
</P>
<P>
	Although the bill had 77 co-sponsors, Sen. Phil Gramm objected  
to its reliance on tax changes to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
	So the Senate put off finding a way to pay for the $800 million,  
five-year measure. Instead, it directs future negotiators to come 
up with unspecified spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy predicted that wouldn't be a problem, saying that  
President Clinton personally promised to find cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll find a way to pay for it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also has considerable support in the House but  
is stalled over how to pay for it. It has cleared the Commerce 
Committee but still must move through the Ways and Means Committee, 
which sets tax and disability policy. Last year, the House passed 
similar legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means  
Committee, said he was optimistic about the bill's chances in the 
House this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an obligation both to the people with disabilities and  
to the American taxpayer to accomplish this goal while maintaining 
our fiscal discipline,'' Archer said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Senate backers are hoping Congress can finish work  
on the legislation by late July, when they will mark the 9th 
anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than one half of one percent of Americans receiving  
disability benefits ever return to work. That's mostly because they 
fear losing the health insurance that is often so central to their 
lives, advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would also inject competition among those who train the  
disabled to work. Those with disabilities could choose to continue 
getting services from government rehabilitation programs, or they 
could go to privately run programs. 
</P>
<P>
	And it would give the trainers an extra incentive to get people  
to work -- the trainers would get some of the money saved because of 
decreased government disability benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would affect about 9 million adults who collect  
federal disability benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who use the Social Security Disability Insurance program  
could keep their Medicare benefits after returning to work. States 
would get the option to extend Medicaid to those in the 
Supplemental Security Income program for low-income people, 
allowing them to buy into the program and pay premiums that would 
rise as their income grows. 
</P>
<P>
	States will each have to decide whether to extend Medicaid,  
which is paid for with a combination of state and federal money. 
Kennedy predicted disability activists will soon be flooding state 
legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congressional Budget Office estimates that, because the bill  
makes the disability program more attractive, it will attract new 
people to the program. That, combined with the changes to 
rehabilitation services, would cost the federal government $800 
million over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who is traveling with the  
president in Europe, did not vote on the bill.

<HEADLINE> University Settles Free-Speech Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULUTH, Minn. (AP) -- A teacher who posed for a campus history  
club photo wearing a coonskin cap and holding a pistol, and another 
who had a laurel wreath and a Roman sword, received a six-figure 
settlement from college officials who saw nothing funny about the 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	The University of Minnesota-Duluth agreed to pay $150,000 to  
settle the teachers' free speech lawsuit out of court. The 
settlement was reached in February but not previously disclosed, 
the Duluth News-Tribune reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I consider it a victory in our particular situation. But in  
the long run, the university has not learned from this,'' plaintiff 
Albert Burnham said, adding he was upset that the school refused to 
admit wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnham and Ron Marchese agreed to have spoof pictures taken as  
part of a display aimed at getting students to join the history 
club. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnham, an expert on U.S. military history, wore purple  
high-top shoes, a Hawaiian shirt and a coonskin cap and held a 
pistol. Marchese, an expert on ancient Rome and Greece, wore a 
cardboard laurel wreath and had a Roman short sword. 
</P>
<P>
	Around the time they were put on display in spring 1992,  
anonymous fliers containing death threats were circulating around 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the pictures had nothing to do with the threats,  
then-Chancellor Lawrence Ianni ordered them removed from a display 
case after at least one professor complained. He argued they 
contributed to ``a climate of fear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burnham and Marchese sued the university for $1.2 million,  
claiming that Ianni had violated their First Amendment rights. 
Burnham said school officials had ``bowed to the whims of political 
correctness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit went up to a federal appeals court, which sided with  
the teachers. The settlement provides $65,000 each to Burnham and 
Marchese, $5,000 total to two students who joined in the suit and 
$15,000 to the plaintiffs' attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Marchese, a tenured professor, is still at the school, though  
currently on sabbatical. Burnham, a nontenured instructor, lost his 
job in 1995 when he was not hired for another year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Rotenberg, general counsel for the University of Minnesota  
system, said Tuesday the agreement allows the university to move 
on. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was time to put this to rest with a settlement.'' Rotenberg  
said. ``Continuing to argue about this issue was not in the 
university's best interest any longer.''

<HEADLINE> Housing Starts Bounce Back in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Construction of new homes and apartments  
posted a significant rebound in May, following a sharp drop the 
month before. 
</P>
<P>
	Builders started work last month on 1.676 million units at a  
seasonally adjusted annual rate, a 6.3 percent increase from April, 
the Commerce Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	May's increase follows a 9.7 percent drop in construction starts  
in April, a slightly smaller decrease than originally estimated by 
the government. That's because the Commerce Department said today 
that housing starts in April totaled 1.576 million units, a little 
bit more than previously estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in May was expected and was in line with analysts  
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing starts were up in all parts of the country, with the  
Northeast leading the way with 158 thousand units, a 16.2 percent 
increase in May from the month before. 
</P>
<P>
	The Midwest posted a 10.6 percent jump with 355 thousand units.  
The South reported a 4.35 percent increase in housing starts with 
744 thousand units and the West posted a 3.20 percent increase with 
419 thousand units. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall increase in housing starts was led by construction  
of single-family homes and came despite a 18.3 percent drop in 
apartment construction. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1.409 million new single-family housing starts posted in May  
was the highest level since December 1978, which reported 1.460 
million units, the Commerce Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	May's overall increase comes as home builders -- while optimistic  
about the prospects for home sales in the present and near term -- 
have voiced concerns about shortages of skilled construction 
workers and building materials, such as gypsum wallboard, 
insulation and brick, the National Association of Home Builders 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, home builders said they are keeping an eye on  
mortgage rates, which have been rising. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite low unemployment and high consumer confidence, sales of  
existing homes dipped in April after an all-time high in March and 
the pace of new home sales has begun to cool in recent months, a 
move that analysts have attributed to the rising mortgage rates.

<HEADLINE>  Gore Makes His Candidacy Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARTHAGE, Tenn. (AP) -- Al Gore promised an all-consuming ``fight  
for America's families'' in a presidential announcement address 
Wednesday that declared his commitment to moral leadership and 
signaled his independence from Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our families are loved, but overstretched,'' the vice  
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential  
nomination, claimed a share of credit for the six-year economic 
recovery under President Clinton, but said the work is not 
complete. With unemployment low and the stock market high, parents 
are still working too hard and spending too much time away from 
their children in a world that is increasingly hostile to families, 
Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have closed our budget deficit. But today, we find a  
deficit of even greater danger -- one that only seems to deepen the 
harder we work and the better we do,'' Gore told a crowd estimated 
by police at 4,000 to 5,000 -- more than the population of his rural 
hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are our deficits now: the time deficit in family life;  
the decency deficit in our common culture; the care deficit for our 
little ones and our elderly parents,'' Gore said before leaving for 
campaign trips to Iowa and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton focused ``like a laser beam'' on the economy to  
win in 1992, Gore will narrow his sights on what he calls ``the 
crisis in the American family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His family friendly agenda: Revolutionize schools, curb access  
to guns, ease traffic congestion, improve community planning, 
provide after-school care for children of working parents and crack 
down on an entertainment industry that ``glorifies aggression and 
indecency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As important as prosperity is,'' he said, ``there is a hunger  
and a thirst for goodness among us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In using phrases such as ``moral leadership'' and ``values and  
faith and family,'' the vice president appeared to be distancing 
himself from questions about Clinton's character to show he can 
stand on his own as a presidential figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's sole opposition for the Democratic presidential  
nomination is former Sen. Bill Bradley, who trails in the polls. 
Yet with all the advantages of the White House at his disposal, 
Gore runs behind in head-to-head polling against GOP presidential 
favorites Texas Gov. George W. Bush and former American Red Cross 
President Elizabeth Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's spokeswoman Anita Dunn declined comment on Gore's  
address. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, in an interview Monday with CNN, said of Gore: ``He is the  
status quo.'' Gore alluded to Bush when he said some politicians 
``try to duck the issue of'' abortion and when he said people can't 
wait for ``crumbs of compassion,'' a reference to the governor's 
``compassionate conservative'' brand of politics, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's announcement came at the heels of Bush's inaugural  
campaign trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Both front-runners spoke briefly in Spanish, promoted  
faith-based institutions that address social ills and talked about 
compassion in government. Their speeches were slick, well-produced 
shows that packaged the candidates' best qualities and avoided 
delving too deeply into issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush seemed more at ease than Gore in the handshake-to-handshake  
drills of retail politics. The vice president dealt with more 
policy than the Texas governor. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Republicans cited Gore's own words in his  
announcement speech to pinpoint what they said are inconsistencies 
in the vice president's record on gun control and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Worried Democrats say Americans don't know enough about Gore, a  
problem he tried to address with a largely autobiographical speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vice presidents check their identities at the door,'' said  
Democratic consultant Dane Strother. ``He needs to reclaim his 
identity and jettison this cocoon of the vice presidency to fill 
out his own campaign and fill out his own personal history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, 51 and a Vietnam veteran, is a former journalist, House  
member and U.S. senator whose late father, Albert Gore Sr., also 
served Tennessee in the Senate. In Washington, the Republican Party 
staged events Wednesday highlight the large portions of Gore's 
youth spent in the nation's capital as a privileged senator's son. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was introduced by his wife, Tipper, and eldest daughter,  
Karenna Gore Schiff. Mrs. Gore gave way to her daughter because she 
had lost her voice. Mrs. Schiff, 25, is expecting the Gores' first 
grandchild in 11 days. 
</P>
<P>
	An amateur photographer, Mrs. Gore took pictures of the crowd  
from the front porch of the red-brick courthouse that has served as 
a backdrop for the start of each of Gore's political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	A half dozen AIDS protesters, wearing white T-shirts reading  
``Gore's greed kills!'' were ushered out by security. Their 
shouting briefly overwhelmed Gore's voice on live TV and prompted 
one of the vice president's rare ad libs: ``I love free speech.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The speech was well-received.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's got them turned on,'' Lanny Turner of Eagleville,  
Tenn. ``You can tell he really means what he says.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a series of interviews before the address, Gore said the  
Monica Lewinsky scandal was inexcusable and predicted that he and 
Clinton would disagree publicly on issues. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Lewinsky matter ``wasted time'' for the Clinton  
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Subtle as they were, buzz words in the interviews and his  
address were designed to help Gore creep outside Clinton's shadow, 
vice presidential advisers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I make to you this pledge: if you entrust me with the  
presidency, I will marshal its authority, its resources, and its 
moral leadership to fight for America's families,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With your help, I will take my own values and faith and family  
to the presidency -- to build an America that is not only better 
off, but better,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was in Europe for a long-scheduled trip while Gore made  
his announcement. White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton 
called Gore after watching the speech and told him it was 
``terrific'' and ``provided a clear choice for Americans.''

<HEADLINE> Golfer Charged With Drunken Driving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANDUSKY, Ohio (AP) -- A man who crashed his golf cart on the  
course was arrested and charged with driving under the influence. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Herriott, 41, was charged after the Mills Creek Golf Course  
called police over the June 10 incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Herriott acknowledged that he was drinking before going to the  
public course and while on the links. 
</P>
<P>
	He was driving near the putting green when he slammed into a  
post and a sign. The sign was slightly bent and the golf cart had 
some scrapes. He said he thought he would get billed for the 
damage, not arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised. I figured they were going to tell how much I  
would be paying because I told everyone I would pay for the 
damage,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Capt. Gary Frankowski said he couldn't immediately recall  
any previous case of a golf cart operator charged with DUI, but 
added: ``We've had many people in the past arrested on DUI charges 
for driving mopeds, bicycles and other vehicles.''

<HEADLINE> Inhofe Lifts Holds on Appointees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A confrontation between President Clinton and  
the Senate over installing an openly gay businessman as ambassador 
to Luxembourg ended Wednesday with a presidential promise to give 
advance notice of recess appointments. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., said that as a result of President  
Clinton's pledge he would stop blocking action on presidential 
nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	One of several Republican senators who opposed the nomination of  
James Hormel of San Francisco to the diplomatic post, Inhofe said 
he was blocking appointments ``to uphold the Senate's proper role 
in the `advice and consent' process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``holds,'' Inhofe said in a statement, were ``never designed  
to undo the appointment'' of Hormel. Over the Memorial Day 
congressional recess, the president circumvented the Senate by 
appointing Hormel ambassador to Luxembourg. Hormel, a 
philanthropist and heir to a meatpacking fortune, is the nation's 
first openly gay ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	Though a letter from Clinton to Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott prompted Inhofe to call off his challenge, it did not settle 
the issue with at least one conservative group. 
</P>
<P>
	The Southern Baptists, the nation's largest Protestant  
denomination, voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to urge Clinton to 
rescind Hormel's appointment because of his homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans, however, insisted that their objection was  
with Clinton making the appointment while Congress was on vacation. 
Lott, R-Miss., denounced the practice of recess appointments, 
suggesting he was blindsided. White House officials said Lott was 
notified shortly before the appointment was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Inhofe had said he would seek to block every civilian nomination  
by the president to protest the move. By custom, any senator can 
place a ``hold'' on any nomination, but it usually is done on 
individual nominees, not en masse, and the majority leader does not 
have to honor it. 
</P>
<P>
	White House chief of staff James Podesta, in a letter to Lott,  
took ``significant issue'' with Inhofe's assertion that Clinton 
demonstrated ``contempt for Congress and the Constitution'' in 
circumventing the Senate confirmation process. 
</P>
<P>
	``The debate on Mr. Hormel is not about constitutional  
authority, it is about a very small number of senators who believe 
that sexual orientation can disqualify an exceptional nominee from 
confirmation,'' Podesta wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	In a June 10 conversation and in a letter the same day to  
Clinton, Lott cited an understanding reached in 1985 between Sen. 
Robert Byrd, D-W.V., and President Reagan that prior to recess 
breaks, the White House would inform Senate leaders of any 
appointments planned during the recess. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Clinton agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``My administration has made it a practice to notify Senate  
leaders in advance of our intentions in this regard, and this 
precedent will continue to be observed,'' Clinton wrote to Lott. 
The president added that in return he expects the Senate to grant 
White House nominees ``expeditious consideration,'' unlike its 
treatment of Hormel. 
</P>
<P>
	Inhofe declared victory. ``I am pleased to learn that the  
president agrees with me that the Byrd-Reagan agreement ... is 
appropriate and will be followed in the future,'' he said. ``I 
remain disappointed that it was not followed with regard to the 
recess appointment made on June 4.''

<HEADLINE> Fryman Joins Indians' Crowded DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Travis Fryman was put on the disabled list for  
the first time in his career by the Cleveland Indians on Wednesday 
because of back spasms. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman joins other starters Sandy Alomar and Wil Cordero on the  
DL. The Indians also have three others -- Mark Whiten, Tom Martin 
and Mark Langston -- sidelined with injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman missed his ninth straight game Wednesday night and will  
be eligible to return Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Travis tried to do too much too soon,'' Indians  
manager Mike Hargrove said. ``This will give him a break and takes 
the pressure off him trying to come back too early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The third baseman is hitting .261 with eight homers and 37 RBIs.  
He hasn't played since June 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman, 30, had never been on the DL before, a span of 1,687  
games. He has averaged 152 games over his past seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always been an unpublic goal to play my whole career  
without going on the DL,'' Fryman said. ``It feels strange to have 
to sit and watch. It is not frustrating, but it is disappointing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His move to the DL was retroactive to June 6.  
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the problem is muscular in nature,'' Fryman said. ``We  
have to do some fairly creative stretching to get it to loosen up. 
I feel better today than Tuesday.'' 
</P>

<P>
	BUHL, Idaho (AP) -- Olympian Sarah Ulmer of New Zealand soloed

to win the 84.2-mile ninth stage of the Women's Challenge bicycle 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Ulmer finished Wednesday's stage in 3 hours, 1 minute, 32  
seconds. 
</P>
<P>

barely outsprinted Olympian Susy Pryde of Saturn for second place, 
33 seconds off the pace. 
</P>
<P>
	American Brenda Black initiated the breakaway eight miles into  
the relatively flat stage. With the temperature approaching 100 
degrees and the wind at their back, the break averaged more than 27 
mph for the remaining 75 miles.

<HEADLINE> USDA Sends Pork Producers More Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department is directing aid  
for financially squeezed hog producers to small and medium-size 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Some $125 million will be released over the next month.  
Individual payments will be limited to the first 2,500 hogs a farm 
sold in the last half of 1998, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The payments should reach 96 percent of the nation's hog farms,  
handling 41 percent of the nation's hogs, he said. Hog production 
has become increasingly concentrated in giant farms that handle 
thousands of animals at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork producers ``have suffered extreme difficulty. This will  
help them, certainly,'' Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department handed out $50 million in similar  
payments earlier this year, and was authorized by Congress last 
month to provide up to $245 million for additional payments, 
government pork purchases or other assistance. It was left up to 
USDA to decide how much to spend, 
</P>
<P>
	Pork prices fell to 8 cents a pound in December, well below the  
cost of production of about 40 cents. On Tuesday, hogs were selling 
in Minnesota and Iowa for 33.5 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, farm-state Democrats tried unsuccessfully Tuesday to  
add $6.4 billion in general farm aid to a Senate subcommittee's 
version of USDA's 2000 budget. The proposal fell on a party-line 
6-5 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in pork prices has mirrored a general downturn in the  
farm economy because of a worldwide glut in grain and other 
commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tens of thousands of farmers and their families are losing  
their livelihood and their life savings,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, 
D-Iowa. ``I'm telling you it is a bad situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., chairman of the Senate  
Agricultural appropriations subcommittee, said the Clinton 
administration should take the lead and propose an aid package of 
its own. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are willing and ready to discuss with the administration,''  
Cochran said. ``We've heard nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman later declined to comment on whether the administration  
would make such a request. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do believe there will in all likelihood be the need for  
additional assistance. I can't tell you what it will be or in what 
amounts,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House on Tuesday moved to give Congress more oversight over  
trade sanctions that inhibit exports of farm commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Selective Agricultural Embargoes Act, which passed by voice  
vote, requires the president to submit a report to Congress within 
five days of imposing a selective embargo on agricultural goods. If 
Congress disapproves, the embargo would cease 100 days after the 
date of the report.

<HEADLINE>  Gore Makes His Candidacy Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARTHAGE, Tenn. (AP) -- Al Gore promised an all-consuming ``fight  
for America's families'' in a presidential announcement address 
Wednesday that declared his commitment to moral leadership and 
signaled his independence from Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our families are loved, but overstretched,'' the vice  
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential  
nomination, claimed a share of credit for the six-year economic 
recovery under President Clinton, but said the work is not 
complete. With unemployment low and the stock market high, parents 
are still working too hard and spending too much time away from 
their children in a world that is increasingly hostile to families, 
Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have closed our budget deficit. But today, we find a  
deficit of even greater danger -- one that only seems to deepen the 
harder we work and the better we do,'' Gore told a crowd estimated 
by police at 4,000 to 5,000 -- more than the population of his rural 
hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are our deficits now: the time deficit in family life;  
the decency deficit in our common culture; the care deficit for our 
little ones and our elderly parents,'' Gore said before leaving for 
campaign trips to Iowa and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton focused ``like a laser beam'' on the economy to  
win in 1992, Gore will narrow his sights on what he calls ``the 
crisis in the American family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His family friendly agenda: Revolutionize schools, curb access  
to guns, ease traffic congestion, improve community planning, 
provide after-school care for children of working parents and crack 
down on an entertainment industry that ``glorifies aggression and 
indecency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As important as prosperity is,'' he said, ``there is a hunger  
and a thirst for goodness among us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In using phrases such as ``moral leadership'' and ``values and  
faith and family,'' the vice president appeared to be distancing 
himself from questions about Clinton's character to show he can 
stand on his own as a presidential figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's sole opposition for the Democratic presidential  
nomination is former Sen. Bill Bradley, who trails in the polls. 
Yet with all the advantages of the White House at his disposal, 
Gore runs behind in head-to-head polling against GOP presidential 
favorites Texas Gov. George W. Bush and former American Red Cross 
President Elizabeth Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's spokeswoman Anita Dunn declined comment on Gore's  
address. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, in an interview Monday with CNN, said of Gore: ``He is the  
status quo.'' Gore alluded to Bush when he said some politicians 
``try to duck the issue of'' abortion and when he said people can't 
wait for ``crumbs of compassion,'' a reference to the governor's 
``compassionate conservative'' brand of politics, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's announcement came at the heels of Bush's inaugural  
campaign trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Both front-runners spoke briefly in Spanish, promoted  
faith-based institutions that address social ills and talked about 
compassion in government. Their speeches were slick, well-produced 
shows that packaged the candidates' best qualities and avoided 
delving too deeply into issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush seemed more at ease than Gore in the handshake-to-handshake  
drills of retail politics. The vice president dealt with more 
policy than the Texas governor. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Republicans cited Gore's own words in his  
announcement speech to pinpoint what they said are inconsistencies 
in the vice president's record on gun control and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Worried Democrats say Americans don't know enough about Gore, a  
problem he tried to address with a largely autobiographical speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vice presidents check their identities at the door,'' said  
Democratic consultant Dane Strother. ``He needs to reclaim his 
identity and jettison this cocoon of the vice presidency to fill 
out his own campaign and fill out his own personal history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, 51 and a Vietnam veteran, is a former journalist, House  
member and U.S. senator whose late father, Albert Gore Sr., also 
served Tennessee in the Senate. In Washington, the Republican Party 
staged events Wednesday highlight the large portions of Gore's 
youth spent in the nation's capital as a privileged senator's son. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was introduced by his wife, Tipper, and eldest daughter,  
Karenna Gore Schiff. Mrs. Gore gave way to her daughter because she 
had lost her voice. Mrs. Schiff, 25, is expecting the Gores' first 
grandchild in 11 days. 
</P>
<P>
	An amateur photographer, Mrs. Gore took pictures of the crowd  
from the front porch of the red-brick courthouse that has served as 
a backdrop for the start of each of Gore's political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	A half dozen AIDS protesters, wearing white T-shirts reading  
``Gore's greed kills!'' were ushered out by security. Their 
shouting briefly overwhelmed Gore's voice on live TV and prompted 
one of the vice president's rare ad libs: ``I love free speech.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The speech was well-received.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's got them turned on,'' Lanny Turner of Eagleville,  
Tenn. ``You can tell he really means what he says.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a series of interviews before the address, Gore said the  
Monica Lewinsky scandal was inexcusable and predicted that he and 
Clinton would disagree publicly on issues. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Lewinsky matter ``wasted time'' for the Clinton  
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Subtle as they were, buzz words in the interviews and his  
address were designed to help Gore creep outside Clinton's shadow, 
vice presidential advisers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I make to you this pledge: if you entrust me with the  
presidency, I will marshal its authority, its resources, and its 
moral leadership to fight for America's families,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With your help, I will take my own values and faith and family  
to the presidency -- to build an America that is not only better 
off, but better,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was in Europe for a long-scheduled trip while Gore made  
his announcement. White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton 
called Gore after watching the speech and told him it was 
``terrific'' and ``provided a clear choice for Americans.''

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Marty Stuart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Marty Stuart is on a mission.  
</P>
<P>
	In a tiny, packed former strip joint turned Latin dance club,  
the country singer is shooting a music video for ``Red, Red Wine 
and Cheatin' Songs,'' the first single from his ambitious new 
album, ``The Pilgrim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1975, Willie Nelson's concept album, ``The Red Headed  
Stranger,'' brought a whole new audience to country music -- young 
people who had previously written it off as saccharine music out of 
touch with their generation. As his first million-selling album 
after years of struggle, ``The Red Headed Stranger'' propelled 
Nelson to superstardom almost 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuart's ``The Pilgrim'' could have the same impact.  
</P>
<P>
	There are similarities in the stories on both LPs: a violent  
death sets off the action, and the main character goes on a quest 
for redemption. 
</P>
<P>
	And like ``The Red Headed Stranger,'' Stuart's new album comes  
at a time when sales of country music are slipping. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps fans want something new and different, even a bit  
challenging. Like Nelson, Stuart is offering it. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in a black suit with pink trim, Stuart doesn't break a  
sweat lip-synching and leaping about with his band on the small 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
	When the filming stops, Stuart keeps moving. A book publisher  
wants to show him a proposed cover for his collection of 
photographs. Someone else who stops in to say hello turns out to be 
a guitar designer with whom Stuart collaborates. 
</P>
<P>
	He also talks business with his manager, and visits with MCA  
Records executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a makeup woman follows Stuart about, touching him up  
during the rare moments he stands still. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to go to the bus and talk?'' he asks. ``I've got a  
20-minute break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stuart's road manager carves a path through the crew and  
hangers-on. Stuart is quickly out the back door, up the steps of 
his tour bus and settled on a sofa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I read an article in Time magazine some while back that said,  
`The hillbilly has lost his voice,''' Stuart said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had a picture of Hank Williams by it and talked about how  
what we're doing in Nashville doesn't really merit any recognition 
anymore. And I disagree with that article, and perhaps there is one 
note or one moment in this record that can kind of correct that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Pilgrim'' covers most of the country music touchstones,  
and tries to stretch the boundaries a bit. 
</P>
<P>
	It has a suicide song (``Reasons''), a hobo song (``Hobo's  
Prayer''), and a song set at a mother's grave (``Redemption''). The 
music veers from pure bluegrass to Tom Petty-style rock to ``The 
Observations of a Crow,'' the stream-of-consciousness rap of a crow 
on a telephone line. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Cash, bluegrass great Ralph Stanley, Pam Tillis, Emmylou  
Harris and George Jones show up in singing cameos. Cash ends it 
with a dramatic recitation from Tennyson's ``Sir Galahad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The album tells a story of redemption based on an incident from  
Stuart's boyhood. ``The Pilgrim'' was inspired by someone Stuart 
knew who, in a line from ``The Observations of a Crow,'' was 
``tortured by a love he thought was supposed to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The man Stuart calls The Pilgrim fell in love with a married  
woman. The woman's husband killed himself in the mistaken belief 
she was having an affair. After leaving town in disgrace, The 
Pilgrim eventually returned and married his love. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's probably one of the first incidents in my life  
that was a real tragedy,'' Stuart said. ``I knew the person that 
killed himself. One day you're hanging around with people like that 
and going to church with them, and the next day they're gone for a 
reason that you can't explain. So it was like the first scar on my 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you just go back and visit those original memories,  
and you go, `Wow, this is pretty powerful.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The tale is reminiscent of ``The Red Headed Stranger'' album, a  
work Stuart hadn't heard until recently. 
</P>
<P>
	At 40, the Philadelphia, Miss., native is a widely respected  
musician who has yet to achieve the stardom his talent deserves. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuart started his music career at 12 with gospel act Jerry and  
Tammy Sullivan. He joined the band of bluegrass legend Lester Flatt 
the next year as its mandolin player. He paid more dues in the 
bands of Vassar Clements and Doc Watson before joining Cash's band 
for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	His first wife was Cash's daughter, Cindy. He married singer  
Connie Smith since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuart was signed by Cash's record label, CBS, and issued  
``Marty Stuart'' in 1986. He moved to MCA three years later, and 
found his greatest success in the early 1990s with hits like 
``Tempted'' and ``The Whiskey Ain't Workin,''' a duet with Travis 
Tritt. 
</P>
<P>
	Tritt and Stuart shared the successful ``No Hats Tour'' in 1992,  
irreverently named for the preponderance of young singers sporting 
cowboy hats at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuart has found the hits harder to come by in the last few  
years, though he continues to be a popular live attraction. He also 
has amassed a formidable collection of country music artifacts, and 
his photographs of country music stars are on exhibit in a 
Nashville museum. 
</P>
<P>
	He's hoping ``The Pilgrim'' will remind people that country  
music can be challenging without losing sight of its basic virtues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Country music has kind of drifted away from the reality of  
life,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And that's what made us great in the first place. It always  
spoke a common language. We were correspondents. We went around 
reporting on real life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Pilgrim,'' he says, ``was simply a real life report.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in country music ...  
</P>
<P>
	HONORS: Missouri fiddler Bob Holt has won a 1999 National  
Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. He'll 
be honored in Washington, D.C., in the fall. Holt's latest CD is 
``Got a Little Home to Go To,'' on Rounder Records. ``The 
Encyclopedia of Country Music'' was honored by The Popular Culture 
Association as one of the best reference books of 1998. It was 
edited by Paul Kingsbury of the Country Music Hall of Fame and 
published by Oxford University Press.

<HEADLINE> Government Y2K Bill To Hit $8 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has scrapped a  
proposal to move the federal New Year's holiday to Jan. 3 to give 
computer experts extra time to fix the Year 2000 problem. 
</P>
<P>
	With New Year's Day falling on a Saturday, advocates of the plan  
had urged the government to recognize the holiday the following 
Monday to provide an extra day to resolve problems before employees 
returned during the first work week of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	But the White House Office of Management and Budget said in a  
new report released Tuesday night that Clinton's top Y2K experts 
rejected the plan as ``unwise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It would require extensive reprogramming of systems to account  
for the change that would only add to the burden of Year 2000 
work,'' the OMB said. 
</P>
<P>
	The OMB also raised to at least $8.06 billion its estimate of  
how much the federal government expects to spend fixing the Y2K 
problem, $1.3 billion more than it predicted just three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said the increase was due mostly to the Defense  
Department's use of $1.05 billion in emergency funds set aside by 
Congress to fix the most important computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The $8.06 billion estimate includes money spent on the problem  
by federal agencies since fiscal 1996, when some of the earliest 
repair work started. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also said 93 percent of the government's 6,190 most  
important computers have been repaired, replaced or never were 
vulnerable, up from 79 percent in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 410 computer systems government-wide that aren't ready,  
most are being repaired, it said. Thirty-five computer systems are 
being replaced and 24 are being scrapped, it added. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen federal agencies said all of their most important  
computers were prepared. Ten other agencies -- including the 
departments of agriculture, commerce, energy and justice -- still 
have unfinished work. Among the systems still not ready is part of 
the FBI's automated fingerprint system, the report said, but the 
Justice Department said it should be fixed by next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The government had earlier set a March 31 deadline for all  
agencies to have their most important systems repaired. 
</P>
<P>
	Many computers originally programmed to recognize only the last  
two digits of a year will not work properly beginning Jan. 1, 2000, 
when those machines will assume it is 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Most computers can be reprogrammed, but many devices have  
embedded microchips that must be physically replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest report said agencies were making ``good progress'' on  
replacing the affected embedded chips and predicted that part of 
the Y2K problem, at least, ``will not have a significant effect on 
the delivery of their programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Those few agencies (such as the Defense Department and NASA)  
that use specialized, mission-critical equipment that relies on 
embedded chips are working hard to find and fix any problems,'' the 
report said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Cop Sentenced to 10 to 20 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- A retired policeman who admitted  
killing his wife and daughter smiled after a judge sentenced him to 
10 to 20 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the manslaughter sentences, Anthony Ambrosovitch  
was given terms up to 15 years for the attempted manslaughter of 
his daughter's boyfriend and weapons possession and seven years for 
reckless endangerment. He will be eligible for parole in 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	He nodded in satisfaction when he was assured that all sentences  
would run concurrently and smiled as he left the courtroom on 
Tuesday. Ambrosovitch, 66, who pleaded guilty, could have been 
sentenced to 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Psychiatrists for both the defense and prosecution agreed that  
he suffered from extreme emotional disturbance at the time of the 
killings in June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambrosovitch apparently was set off by the illness of his  
70-year-old wife, Gloria, and criticism from his 40-year-old 
daughter, Melinda Podesta. He shot them both, wounded his 
daughter's boyfriend and held police at bay for hours outside his 
Tarrytown home in a suburb north of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	According to court papers, Ambrosovitch said after his arrest  
that his actions were premeditated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I shot my daughter in the neck to make her bleed. I watched  
her gurgle,'' he was quoted as saying. ``She lasted almost an hour. 
My wife died instantly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers said Ambrosovitch has heart and lung problems  
and requires oxygen and a variety of medications each day. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge described the sentence as ``in effect a life sentence,  
in view of the defendant's advanced age and ill health.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Olympic Cup Set for San Diego </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- American Olympic hopefuls, including a team of  
WNBA players, will take on top international foes in a four-day, 
five-sport tournament in Southern California this summer, The 
Associated Press learned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Olympic Cup, set for Sept. 9-12 in San Diego, will  
feature women's basketball and softball, men's boxing, and men's 
and women's beach volleyball and swimming, according to officials 
close to the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The event will be telecast on ESPN2 and receive financial  
backing from Bank of America, said the officials, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	A news conference is scheduled for Thursday in San Diego to  
announce the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said 350 athletes are expected to compete, with U.S.  
teams facing high-ranking competition in a format similar to that 
used in the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Under preliminary plans, a WNBA team would play for the  
basketball title against teams from Brazil, Australia and Poland, 
the officials said, while the beach volleyball event would be a 
qualifier for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia, one of the few teams that can challenge the United  
States in women's softball, is tentatively set to compete, while 
Russian boxers are expected to go against the United States and at 
least one other nation in eight weight classes, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear how the team members would be  
picked. 
</P>
<P>
	The events would be held at ``major venues'' in the San Diego  
area, although the locations were still being discussed, the 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's announcement will cap almost three years of planning  
for the cup, which was developed by the U.S. Olympic Committee as a 
way of getting athletes prepared for top-level international 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	It helps fill the training gap left when the USOC dropped its  
Olympic Festivals, a domestic developmental event, in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Tennis Player From 1930s Dies at 99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORAGA, Calif. (AP) -- Anna McCune Harper, who replaced Helen  
Wills Moody in 1930 as the top-ranked U.S. women's tennis player, 
has died. She was 99. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper, a member of the Cal Athletic Hall of Fame, died Monday  
at the Rheem Valley Convalescent Center in Moraga, 10 years to the 
day after her husband, Lawrence, died. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper won the mixed doubles at Wimbledon in 1931.  
</P>
<P>
	She was called home in 1932 because of an illness in the family,  
then decided to give up tennis for other tasks -- including raising 
three children. 
</P>
<P>
	She always followed the game and underwent arthroscopic knee  
surgery at the age of 81 so she could continue to play. A bad 
reaction to the anesthetic ended her playing days and apparently 
began a slow decline in her health. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include her daughter, Virginia Harper Harrison, and  
sons Lawrence Harper and Robert G. Harper. 
</P>
<P>
	Private funeral services were scheduled Monday at Mountain View  
Cemetery in Oakland.

<HEADLINE> Columbia/HCA Exec Denies Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- An executive at one of the nation's largest  
hospital companies testified at his fraud trial Wednesday that he 
had no reason to question nearly $3 million in disputed Medicare 
payments to a member hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Jarrell, one of four Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp.  
executives charged with conspiring to defraud Medicare and other 
government health-insurance programs of $2.97 million, also denied 
trying to mislead investigators and said he never gained from the 
inflated payments to Fawcett Memorial Hospital in Port Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital's income statements and balance sheets ``supported  
what I already believed, that the debt was truly capital related,'' 
Jarrell said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stand, Jarrell tried to distance himself from the process  
that led to the alleged fraud, saying his duties as a financial 
executive didn't include monitoring reimbursement requests 
submitted by the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't review cost reports. I wasn't involved with the  
preparation of cost reports,'' Jarrell said, when questioned about 
records dating back nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrell and two other executives at Nashville, Tenn.-based  
Columbia/HCA allegedly plotted for Fawcett to misrepresent expenses 
so they would be reimbursed at an inflated rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrell, Michael Neeb and Robert Whiteside are charged with  
cheating Medicare and Medicaid, the tax-supported health-insurance 
programs for the elderly, disabled and poor; and CHAMPUS, medical 
insurance for the military. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl L. Dick is charged with conspiracy.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecution witnesses have testified Jarrell was present at a  
meeting during which executives allegedly lied and withheld 
information to mislead an outside attorney looking into the 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrell denied meeting with the attorney about the issue, and  
presented expense reports with receipts from New York City to show 
he was out of town at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	John Schilling, a whistleblower testifying for the prosecution,  
also has testified that Jarrell attended another meeting via 
teleconference during which Jarrell suggested offering a government 
auditor a job with Columbia/HCA to keep her from reviewing the 
disputed cost reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrell said he didn't recall dialing into that meeting and  
wrapped up his testimony by stating he didn't gain personally from 
Fawcett's reimbursements. 
</P>
<P>
	``In no way has there been any personal benefit to me, no  
compensation benefit,'' Jarrell testified. ``Nor was there any 
thought of doing such.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Jarrell, Neeb and Whiteside each face maximum  
sentences of 35 years in prison and $1.75 million in fines. Dick 
could be sentenced to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents have said the investigation of Columbia/HCA is the  
largest health-care investigation in terms of scope and the amount 
of money at stake.

<HEADLINE> GOP Social Security Plan Blocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A successful move by Senate Democrats blocking  
a bill that Republicans say would protect Social Security surpluses 
has drawn an unusual rebuke from the House's top Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	``What are they afraid of?'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert,  
R-Ill., asked Wednesday in a written statement. ``Not only is this 
the responsible thing to do, it simply makes common sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House speakers seldom go out of their way to comment on a Senate  
action. The blunt tone of Hastert's remarks and their distribution 
by his aides highlighted the important stakes as the two parties 
wrestled for the high ground on Social Security, perhaps the most 
politically sensitive of federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved the bill on May 26 by 416-12.  
</P>
<P>
	The flurry over protecting the surpluses came even as Congress  
illustrated the spending pressures felt by lawmakers, including 
Republicans. One Republican senator lost an attempt to win an extra 
$70 million for solar energy; other senators were seeking 
guaranteed loans for steel, oil and gas companies; and the House 
voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to boost aviation spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert's comments came after Democrats blocked a bill that  
would require support of 60 of the 100 senators to approve using 
Social Security funds for tax cuts or increased spending. 
</P>
<P>
	On a party-line 55-44 roll call, the Senate fell five votes  
short of the 60 needed to end Democratic delays that prevented a 
final vote on the measure. Only Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, traveling 
with the president in Europe, missed the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other times this year, Democrats have prevented the Senate  
from approving a more stringent bill that would require that Social 
Security surpluses be used to reduce the accumulated federal debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats began their delays Wednesday after Republicans refused  
to let them offer an amendment that would set aside $698 billion in 
surpluses that do not come from Social Security over the next 15 
years to revamp Medicare, the health care program for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	That amendment would reduce money available for the big tax cut  
Republicans want. Democrats believe they have a winning issue if 
they pit a Medicare overhaul against GOP tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the choice between Medicare and tax cuts, or just tax  
cuts, our Republican colleagues are choosing just tax cuts every 
time,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats noted that the measure would allow exceptions for any  
legislation labeled as Social Security or Medicare ``reform,'' and 
that the Senate already has rules in effect requiring 60 votes for 
using Social Security funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Senate voted 97-2 to approve a $21.7 billion  
measure financing federal water and energy projects for fiscal 
2000, which begins Oct. 1. The bill includes increases for security 
at Energy Department nuclear weapons laboratories in response to 
findings that the Chinese have stolen secrets from them. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., tried to add $70 million to the  
measure's $354 million for solar and other renewable energy 
projects, but lost 60-39. 
</P>
<P>
	Last-minute changes that were made included setting aside $1.5  
million for zebra mussel research, sponsored by Sens. Carl Levin, 
D-Mich., and Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii; $800,000 by Sen. Larry Craig, 
R-Idaho, to commemorate the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark 
expedition; and $5 million for a University of Missouri research 
reactor by that state's two GOP senators, John Ashcroft and 
Christopher Bond. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate also approved an $8.3 billion measure financing  
military construction by 97-2. And by 95-4, it approved a $1.7 
billion bill financing Congress' own operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate is still debating a proposal by Sens. Robert Byrd,  
D-W.Va., and Pete Domenici, R-N.M., to use $270 million in 
taxpayers' money to back up to $1.5 billion in loans for ailing 
steel, gas and oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, the House approved a five-year, $57 billion plan  
for aviation spending, a $14 billion increase over current plans.

<HEADLINE> Dierker Recovers From Brain Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Drowsy but upbeat, Houston Astros manager Larry  
Dierker emerged from brain surgery joking about his aggressive 
managing style. 
</P>
<P>
	``He says he's still going to do it,'' a laughing Dr. Rob  
Parrish said, after the Methodist Hospital neurosurgeon removed two 
tangled sets of blood vessels from the front of Dierker's brain 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just asked him, `Did I get the stealing third with two outs,  
out?' and he said, `No, we're still going to go.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros recently lost a game when the last out was made on an  
attempted steal of third. 
</P>
<P>
	All jokes aside, Dierker's faces four weeks of convalescence  
following the 5 1/2-hour surgery that sliced the ruptured snarl of 
blood vessels, known as an arteriovenous malformation, free from 
his brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``As Larry said, `They always say don't worry about it, it's not  
brain surgery, but it's brain surgery,''' Parrish said. 
``Certainly, it's serious surgery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mass touched off a seizure in Dierker's brain Sunday night  
after the 52-year-old manager collapsed in the Astros dugout in the 
eighth inning of the team's game against the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was suspended as his fearful players watched Dierker  
placed into an ambulance and rushed to Methodist Hospital, where 
tests located a life-threatening hemorrhage in the right side of 
his brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having an AVM that ruptures is certainly life-threatening,''  
said Parrish, who credited Houston paramedics' quick response and 
attention to keeping Dierker's airway free of obstruction, with 
saving his life. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgeon speculated that the vessels might have burst two  
days before Dierker collapsed. Dierker had complained to friends of 
headaches days before the seizure overcame him. 
</P>
<P>
	Parrish removed the large mass located by the tests and a  
smaller group of burst vessels in the same area. Sunday's tests 
failed to detect the smaller mass because of its size. 
</P>
<P>
	The larger part of the malformation was described by Parrish as  
``significant, 4-by-3 centimeters ... bigger than a walnut, smaller 
than a melon -- maybe a lime, or a really big jalapeno.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeons cut a ``window'' in Dierker's skull to access the  
target area, and the problem vessels were located just beneath the 
surface of the front part of Dierker's brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took the blood clot out, sent the blood clot to pathology  
to make absolutely sure there was no tumor or anything -- and there 
was none,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``After we got it out, we sewed him up and put his bone flap  
back in the window we had made in his skull, so he'll be 
hard-headed,'' Parrish said. Nineteen tiny screws were used to 
close the area. The blood vessels were closed with small titanium 
clips, Parrish said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Dierker asked him before the surgery: ``You mean no more  
head butts?'' And Parrish said he replied: ``Yes. No more head 
butts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the surgeon's making jokes, I guess the skipper is going to  
be OK,'' Jeff Bagwell said. ``Obviously, we're greatly relieved. 
The news has just been getting better every day. It's a breath of 
fresh air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Methodist Hospital officials said Dierker, known for his  
laid-back attitude and affinity for Hawaiian shirts, was upbeat 
headed into surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Parrish said Dierker should be back in the dugout before the  
season ends. He will be undergo another series of tests in a week 
and should be home within 5-10 days of the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Later this week we'll do another angiogram to make absolutely  
certain we got all of it out,'' Parrish said. ``He's awake, alert 
and following commands and looks quite good right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There should be no after-effects to speech, memory or motion.  
</P>
<P>
	``I expect him to be completely intact,'' Parrish said.  
</P>
<P>
	Parrish said once Dierker was revived by the anesthesiologist,  
Parrish said his patient greeted him with a ``Hi Rob!'' and raised 
his hand in a high-five motion. 
</P>
<P>
	Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said Dierker smiled at  
him through an oxygen mask and gave him a thumbs-up signal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best we could have hoped for,'' Astros owner  
Drayton McLane said. ``We're very pleased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a visit by Craig Biggio and Bagwell on Monday, Dierker  
told them to go out and win three out of four games from the 
Atlanta Braves. Houston won 10-4 Monday night and lost 4-3 Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Interim manager Matt Galante directed the team seated next to  
Dierker's empty chair. The team hung Dierker's No. 49 jersey in the 
dugout above his seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Parrish said Dierker watched Monday night's game on television  
and expected the manager to watch Tuesday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker was the third member of the Astros staff to become ill  
this season. First-base coach Jose Cruz left the team May 10 
because of an irregular heartbeat, and hitting coach Tom McCraw 
left six days later for prostate cancer treatment. Cruz is expected 
back this week.

<HEADLINE> Scores Indicted in Stock Fraud Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Capping a three-year securities fraud  
investigation, federal authorities in Brooklyn charged 85 people 
Wednesday with ripping off more than $100 million from thousands of 
unwitting investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said in three separate indictments that nine corrupt  
brokerage firms -- including some with ties to organized crime -- 
used high-pressure and misleading sales pitches to inflate the 
value of 20 microcap stocks. The defendants turned a profit by 
dumping the small-company shares at inflated prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mob never saw a market it didn't want to control,'' Lewis  
Schiliro, head of the FBI's New York office, said at a news 
conference. ``The bull market is attracting more than just the 
honest investor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Zachary Carter said authorities relied on an  
ongoing series of undercover operations to reveal a ``classic 
boiler-room scheme.'' The scheme involved ``a nest of securities 
scam artists who worked in close cooperation, migrating from 
brokerage firm to brokerage firm,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One $10 million scam was led by two associates of both the  
Colombo crime family and one from the Bor Russian crime group, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The reputed mobsters allegedly infiltrated now-closed New York  
branches of Global Strategies Inc., Amerivet Dymally Securities and 
First National Equity Corp. They paid kickbacks to registered and 
unregistered brokers as incentive to cold call potential investors 
and pitch dubious startup companies, including one which claimed to 
be developing golf courses in the South, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants in a similar plot laundered millions of dollars in  
illegal proceeds through offshore bank accounts, authorities said. 
The funds were eventually wired to Nevada casinos, where they were 
withdrawn in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants were being arraigned Wednesday in Brooklyn  
federal court on charges including securities fraud conspiracy, 
mail and wire fraud, money laundering and obstruction of justice. 
The most serious charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in 
prison.

	Consumer Prices Unchanged in May  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer prices held steady in May following  
an April jump that was the largest in nearly nine years. Falling 
energy prices balanced rising food costs to help keep the Consumer 
Price Index flat last month, the Commerce Department said today. 
Core prices -- which exclude the volatile energy and food categories 
and are the most closely watched by economists -- rose a modest 0.1 
percent as clothing and auto prices declined and medical and 
housing costs edged up. So far this year, the annual rate of 
inflation felt by consumers is 2.6 percent, compared to a 1.6 
percent rise for all of 1998, the smallest in a dozen years. 

</P>
<P>
	Housing Starts Bounce Back in May  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Construction of new homes and apartments  
posted a significant rebound in May, following a sharp drop the 
month before. Builders started work last month on 1.676 million 
units at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, a 6.3 percent increase 
from April, the Commerce Department said today. May's increase 
follows a 9.7 percent drop in construction starts in April, a 
slightly smaller decrease than originally estimated by the 
government. That's because the Commerce Department said today that 
housing starts in April totaled 1.576 million units, a little bit 
more than previously estimated. 

</P>
<P>
	Industrial Production Inches Up  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Industrial production, which is making a  
fragile recovery from a slump in global demand caused by economic 
troubles abroad, edged up 0.2 percent in May, the smallest increase 
since February. The Federal Reserve said the modest production gain 
at the nation's factories, mines and utilities reflects a sharp 
increase in output of automotive products, which partially offset a 
large drop in the production of appliances. 

</P>
<P>
	Beige Book Due Today  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve releases its ``Beige  
Book'' study of regional economic conditions this afternoon. In the 
previous report, issued in early May, the Fed said that the U.S. 
economy continued to operate at ``generally strong levels'' and to 
expand at a moderate pace. 

</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com To Buy Into Sotheby's  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Internet superstore Amazon.com is investing  
about $45 million for a 1.7 percent stake in Sotheby's, and they 
will cooperate in developing an online auction service that will 
sell art and collectibles. The deal, announced today, brings 
together the old world and the new. Sotheby's was founded 255 years 
ago and is known for its expensive auctions of fine art and 
jewelry. Amazon.com started in 1995, and it is the leading online 
merchant of books, video and music.

	All Nippon, Lufthansa Talk Alliance  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo-based All Nippon Airways and the German  
airline Lufthansa are in talks to begin sharing air routes in their 
home markets, an ANA spokeswoman said today. The two air carriers 
are discussing sharing up to nine of ANA's routes in Japan and 15 
flown by Lufthansa in Europe, said spokeswoman Kate Opekar. Japan's 
Asahi newspaper said the talks may be concluded as soon as next 
month, but Opekar said they might take longer. Route sharing allows 
one airline to use the others' flights without issuing separate 
tickets.

	Cable &AMP; Wireless To Take Over IDC

	TOKYO (AP) -- Britain's Cable &AMP; Wireless PLC said today it will  
take a 97.69 percent stake in Japanese phone carrier International 
Digital Communications Inc., a key part of a strategy to expand its 
global reach. The announcement in Tokyo came one week after Cable &AMP; 
Wireless won a bidding war for the Tokyo-based company against 
Japanese giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. The takeover -- 
the first to give a foreign firm a controlling stake in a Japanese 
phone company -- will cost Cable &AMP; Wireless 55.2 billion yen ($459.1 
million) in cash to buy the 82 percent of IDC that it does not 
already own.

	Clinton Seeks Ban on Child Labor

<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- President Clinton, opening a week's diplomacy in  
Europe in the aftermath of NATO's Kosovo bombing campaign, today 
urged the U.S. Senate and governments worldwide to accept a new 
treaty banning what he called ``vicious forms of abusive child 
labor.'' ``There are children chained to often-risky machines, 
children handling dangerous chemicals, children forced to work when 
they should be in school, preparing themselves and their countries 
for a better tomorrow,'' the president told the International Labor 
Organization.

	Most Asian Stock Markets Rise

	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian markets closed mostly higher today  
despite fears of an increase in U.S. interest rates. But Tokyo 
shares fell amid concerns that higher U.S. rates could harm Japan's 
economy, still mired in recession. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock 
Average dropped 71.82 points, or 0.42 percent, to close at 
17,210.18. On Tuesday, the Nikkei gained 0.54 percent. In Hong 
Kong, blue chips rose 1.7 percent as investors shrugged off 
interest rate worries. The Hang Seng Index rose 219.71 points to 
close at 13,155.21. On Tuesday, the Hang Seng had fallen 0.6 
percent. The Korean Composite Stock Price Index rose 25.81 points

<HEADLINE> Six Cities Vie For Olympic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The Poles and Slovaks brought  
musicians dressed in alpine outfits, the Italians brought Olympic 
gold medalist Alberto Tomba and the Finns were described as 
hardworking and ``a little bit crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race for the 2006 Winter Games took center stage at Olympic  
meetings Wednesday, with the six European cities holding news 
conferences to promote their bids -- a warmup for Friday's official 
presentations to the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	An IOC panel will reduce the field to two finalists on Saturday,  
and the general assembly will then choose the winner by secret 
ballot. Sion, Switzerland, is the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Delegates for first-time and longshot bidder Zakopane argued  
that Poland has become one of central Europe's economic tigers with 
an annual growth rate of 5 to 7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Poland has championed the democratic transition in Europe and  
showed its effectiveness,'' Polish delegate Krysztof Gorlich said. 
``We not only are a stable democracy, but have dealt with our 
economic problems effectively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gorlich said it was time for the IOC to take the games to a  
region of Europe where they have never been held. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think we are ready, and it would be good for the Olympic  
movement to expand a little into new territories, become more 
universal,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bid delegates from Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia, pulled on hockey  
jerseys for their briefing and ended with a word from Peter 
Stastny, an NHL Hall of Famer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Slovaks said the republic has stabilized politically and  
economically since throwing off communism 10 years ago and 
considers the Olympics as a way to fully reintegrate back into the 
community of Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting the Olympic Games would be one of the nicest gifts we  
could receive ... we could maybe jump ahead 20 years,'' said 
Stastny, a former Quebec Nordiques star. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would tremendously help a country that came from 45 years  
of communist regime ... help to push us back to where we belong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tomba, appearing on behalf of the bid from Turin, Italy, was  
more succinct: ``I would like to say something about the Olympics 
in Turin -- why not?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turin is the largest city competing for the 2006 games and the  
largest city in the arc of the Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	Bidders from Helsinki noted that most of their facilities are  
already in place and said ``the love of sports'' in Finland and 
Norway would ensure large audiences. Because Finland has no 
mountains, the alpine events would be held in Lillehammer, Norway, 
host of the 1994 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever the Finns do, they do well,'' Marit Myramael of  
Norway's Olympic Committee said. ``They are hardworking, they are 
stimulating and they are a little bit crazy -- that's why we like to 
work with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delegates of Klagenfurt, Austria, pushed the strong symbolism of  
their ``games without borders'' concept that includes sites in 
neighboring Slovenia and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bid officials from several of the cities said they were put at a  
disadvantage by the ban on visits by IOC members instituted in the 
wake of the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Direct contact is much better than seeing the city on video or  
in pictures,'' Turin bid official Marco San Pietro said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italians said the ban on visits favored Sion since more than  
60 IOC members visited the Swiss town during its failed bid for the 
2002 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear we have an advantage because we were a candidate  
for 2002,'' Sion bid director Jean-Daniel Mudry said. ``But we 
regret the visits were canceled. We improved our bid since the last 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Olympic newsletter Sport Intern, published in Germany,  
ranked Sion as the top bid, followed by Helsinki, Turin, 
Klagenfurt, Poprad-Tatry and Zakopane. 
</P>
<P>
	Helsinki's No. 2 ranking came as a surprise to those who have  
considered Turin as Sion's main challenger. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he believed Sion was the frontrunner, Mudry  
demurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``In sports, it's not always the favorite who wins,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Phil Collins Gets Hollywood Star </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It was a family affair as Phil Collins got  
his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	The 48-year-old pop star was joined by his fiancee, two  
daughters and one of his ex-wives for Wednesday's ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pleased for my kids,'' he said. ``When they have their own  
children, they will ask, what did granddad do? And they will show 
them my star.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of fans were also on hand, leaving Collins a little  
overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am pitifully unprepared,'' said Collins, a Grammy Award  
winner and former member of the rock band Genesis. ``I didn't 
realize this would be so big. I thought it would just be me, a few 
people and the star. Silly me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The star was sponsored by Walt Disney Co. to promote Friday's  
nationwide opening of its animated ``Tarzan.'' Collins wrote and 
sang several of the movies' songs, including the hit ``You'll Be in 
My Heart.''

<HEADLINE> Allen Clings to Tool Man Character </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- If Tim Allen were a tool, he would  
probably be a vise. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen doesn't let go of things easily, and that includes his  
recently ended ``Home Improvement'' sitcom. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike many actors who desperately try to shed their character's  
persona when a series ends, Allen remains firmly clamped to his 
role as Tim ``The Tool Man'' Taylor, using it to promote a 
signature line of hammers, drills and other hardware equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	He even stores a huge chunk of the ``Home Improvement'' set at  
his Burbank office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like throwing stuff out,'' Allen said. ``I have so  
much memorabilia from 'Home Improvement,' that eventually I'll just 
have to have a yard sale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Letting go of ``Home Improvement,'' which aired its final  
episode on May 25, was difficult for the 46-year-old actor, who 
talks wistfully about the cast and crew as though they were high 
school chums rather than co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I even gave everybody class rings, and the staff gave  
everybody yearbooks,'' he said. ``So it looks like we all 
graduated. I think of it like that. ... like an alma mater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elaborate collection of wooden walls, worktables and  
swinging garage-style doors from the show's fictional ``Tool Time'' 
do-it-yourself program stands near his fleet of vintage cars in the 
garage portion of his office building. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't get enough of it,'' he said. ``I don't wallow in my  
memories, but the show was such a wonderful memory that I want to 
hold onto the experience. And all I have left is this material.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nearly 40-foot set's plywood backing bears the signatures of  
some of the show's crew, and notable props hang on the front, such 
as a calendar featuring ``Tool Time's'' buxom spokesmodel and a 
cutout reindeer head with a Rudolph-style taillight nose. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they delivered the set, it was too big. I had no idea  
what to do with it,'' Allen said. ``I had grips come over to my 
building and put it up, the doors, the backdrop, the whole thing. 
... Then I was sitting in it the other day saying, 'I don't think 
this is a good thing.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his role as a hapless space captain in the upcoming  
sci-fi comedy ``Galaxy Quest'' keeps him from dwelling on the end 
of ``Home Improvement,'' although he misses the ABC-TV show around 
this time of year because other programs have started shooting 
episodes for next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm on fire now,'' he said of his busy schedule. ``I'll  
probably miss the show more in the fall when things quiet down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides appearing in ``Galaxy Quest,'' a futuristic movie about  
a group of sci-fi actors who are mistaken for real heroes, Allen is 
also reprising his role as the voice of spaceman doll Buzz 
Lightyear in the upcoming ``Toy Story'' sequel with Tom Hanks. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his only career worry is that the two movies may open in  
competition with each other. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, he tinkers in the design process of Tim Allen  
Signature Tools and is actively promoting the line for Father's 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which donates its profits to children's charities,  
produces hammers, power drills, screwdrivers, utility knives and 
outdoor equipment like leaf-blowers and hedge-trimmers. 
</P>
<P>
	OK, so does Allen -- who is currently restoring three more  
vintage cars -- use his own stuff? 
</P>
<P>
	Allen said he prefers to keep the tools as collector's items,  
even though they come with a tag imploring buyers to ``Please use 
it!'' 
</P>
<P>
	He would rather use his grandfather's old tools for household  
work, he said, like the ``greasy screwdrivers with the clear, 
yellow plastic handles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Does Allen love fixing things?  
</P>
<P>
	Instead of buying a new table, he repaired a broken leg on one  
dumped on him by his mother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	He even tracked down the maker of his daughter's inexpensive  
digital watch so they could repair the item, which he said was 
``practically worthless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is something wonderful about taking the effort -- and  
it's physical effort, my energy -- to recycle components of our 
lives,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen acknowledged that just about everything he does has a  
sense of nostalgia to it. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Closing Arguments in Lewis Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Under the gaze of Reggie Lewis' widow and small  
children, an attorney for Dr. Gilbert Mudge implored a jury 
Wednesday to find that the cardiologist acted carefully and 
reasonably while treating the late Celtics star. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things are a lot easier to look at in hindsight,'' defense  
lawyer William Dailey Jr. said in his closing argument at the 
malpractice trial stemming from the player's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``Medicine is not a precise science,'' Dailey said. ``(Dr.  
Mudge) was put in a position where he had to exercise his best 
judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury was scheduled to begin deliberations on Thursday after  
receiving instructions from the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial has centered on whether Mudge, along with Brigham and  
Women's Hospital colleagues Drs. Peter Friedman and Mark Creager, 
misdiagnosed and mistreated Lewis' fatal heart condition after the 
27-year-old team captain collapsed during a playoff game in May 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge offered a second opinion that flew in the face of a  
``Dream Team'' of New England Baptist Hospital doctors, who 
diagnosed Lewis with a life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia. 
</P>
<P>
	After telling Lewis he had a benign fainting condition, Mudge  
called a news conference to announce that the 27-year-old team 
captain could likely return to professional basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months later, on July 27, 1993, Lewis died of an arrhythmia,  
or abnormal heart rhythm, while practicing jump shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Harley, an attorney for Lewis' widow, Donna Harris-Lewis,  
has accused Mudge of arrogantly discounting the opinions of other 
doctors regarding Lewis' care and erring by allowing the star to 
leave the hospital with a life-threatening heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``One must ask whether Dr. Mudge wanted to be the doctor who  
could prove the 'Dream Team' of doctors wrong,'' he said during 
closing arguments Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis, who was joined in court for the first time  
Wednesday by her children Reggie Jr., 6, and Reggiena, 5, is suing 
the doctors for the money Lewis would have made had he lived, which 
witnesses for the plaintiffs have estimated at more than $100 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys say there is no way to know if Lewis could  
have returned to professional basketball, or how long he would have 
lived had he received different treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	In their closings, attorneys for Friedman and Creager said the  
consultants were peripheral to the case and should not be held 
responsible for anything said by Mudge, who was Lewis' main doctor, 
at the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys also emphasized that the infamous news  
conference was not a treatment plan, but a staged public relations 
event at which Mudge purposely did not reveal his private 
suspicions about Lewis' possible heart problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven weeks of testimony have pitted Lewis' survivors against  
some of the city's most well-respected doctors. Testimony ranged 
from complex medical assessments by dozens of experts to 
allegations of cocaine use by convicted felons. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge alleged that two weeks before he died, Lewis admitted to  
the doctor that he had used cocaine. Mudge contends the late 
confession made an accurate diagnosis impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Harley attacked the charge as a dirty move intended only to  
smear the reputation of the NBA All-Star. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the medical defense is so good ... why would they stoop so  
low to destroy the reputation of one of the finest young men of his 
generation?'' he asked.

<HEADLINE> Dierker Remains in Intensive Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- An angiogram performed on Houston Astros manager  
Larry Dierker on Wednesday showed no remaining tangled blood 
vessels that caused him to have a seizure in the Astros dugout on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It confirmed that they did get all of the arteriovenous  
malformation,'' Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``That 
hopefully means that we won't have to worry about this ever 
happening again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker remained hospitalized following surgery on Tuesday by  
Dr. Rob Parrish. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Parrish said Larry had a great day,'' Hunsicker said. ``He  
said Larry had a great attitude and seemed to be his normal self.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker had surgery to remove two tangled sets of blood vessels  
from the front of his brain. Doctors say the malformations caused 
the grand mal seizure he suffered in the dugout during a game 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Parrish said Dierker, 52, probably will remain hospitalized into  
next week and faces four weeks of convalescence at home, meaning he 
likely won't return to the Astros until after the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	Bench coach Matt Galante is handling the team in Dierker's  
absence. One of the team's stars, Craig Biggio, has made a pregame 
ritual of hanging Dierker's jersey over his empty seat at the end 
of the dugout.

<HEADLINE> Dow Jumps After Prices Don't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened sharply higher today, drawing  
strength from a consumer price report that calmed investor fears 
about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 134.24 at 10,729.23. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 21.87 at 1,323.03, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
up 62.43 at 2,477.10. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported that May consumer prices excluding  
the volatile energy and food categories rose a modest 0.1 percent. 
Clothing and auto prices declined, and medical and housing costs 
edged up. 
</P>
<P>
	The markets had been anxiously awaiting today's report, which is  
seen as a gauge of inflation in the prospering economy, after a 
surge in April's Consumer Price Index helped prompt the Federal 
Reserve to warn it would might boost interest rates. The Fed's 
policy-setting Open Market Committee next meets June 29-30. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's report helped alleviate some of the markets' concerns.  
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, the annual rate of inflation felt by consumers  
is 2.6 percent, compared to a 1.6 percent rise for all of 1998, the 
smallest in a dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered declining by a 8-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 116.34 million 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 7.92 at 630.20, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was 3.12 at 767.04. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell .32 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.40 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up .33 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 
1.05 percent.

<HEADLINE> World Cup Opener a Near Sellout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The Women's World Cup opener  
between the United States and Denmark on Saturday at Giants Stadium 
is approaching a sellout. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 74,000 tickets have been sold for the doubleheader,  
which also features Brazil against Mexico. The stadium seats about 
77,000 for soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The response has been astounding, which is why we think we  
will fill Giants Stadium on Saturday,'' Marla Messing, president of 
the organizing committee, said Wednesday at the tournament's 
kickoff luncheon. ``I believe there are three reasons: 
</P>
<P>
	``First of all, the success of the 1994 World Cup fueled the  
sport of soccer and the national team programs. A lot of Americans 
are coming back to get that World Cup experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, there is no doubt the success of the U.S. national  
team ... people are very excited about it for this World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then there's the growth of women's sports. The 1996 Olympics  
saw perhaps for the first time on a global scale how entertaining 
and exciting and passionate women's sports can be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Messing said she is just as impressed with ticket sales for the  
other Saturday doubleheader, which has Sweden playing China and 
Japan facing Sweden at San Jose, Calif. Organizers expect about 
20,000 at Spartan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, more than 460,000 tickets have been sold for the  
32-game event that concludes in the Rose Bowl on July 10. If the 
U.S. team gets that far, the tournament is likely to break a 
half-million in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	A worldwide television audience of 1 billion in 70 countries is  
projected for the largest women's-only sporting event in history. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tournament has already been a success in terms of ticket  
sales, media interest, broadcast coverage and sponsorship support, 
but now its time to let the players take over,'' Messing said. 
``This tournament has reached a level that we could only dream 
about when we began the organizing committee in 1997. Now it is in 
the hands of 16 talented teams to battle for the most prestigious 
trophy in soccer.''

<HEADLINE> Hurricanes Have Cold Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Falling temperatures forced Miami coach Jim  
Morris to break out the cold-weather gear, and the rain made the 
NCAA push the College World Series schedule back a day. 
</P>
<P>
	The clouds rolled in, the rain started at midmorning Tuesday and  
temperatures that had been in the 70s dropped to the 50s. Two games 
were postponed until today, and the schedule was shuffled. 
</P>
<P>
	It was an ugly day for the top-seeded team from sunny South  
Florida. Morris said the warm-weather Hurricanes had a miserable 
intrasquad scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were freezing,'' he said. ``We didn't have a very good  
practice today because we were freezing to death. They were wearing 
gloves, everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most coaches explored the pitching possibilities offered by an  
extra day's rest. Morris was frustrated to learn the Hurricanes, 
who haven't played since Sunday, would have even more time on their 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not looking for another day,'' he said. ``We're ready to  
go out and play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Tuesday's schedule pushed back, today's slate had Rice  
(59-14) playing Alabama (52-15) and Cal State-Fullerton (50-13) 
meeting Florida State (54-13). 
</P>
<P>
	The Rice-Alabama winner will advance to play Miami (48-13), and  
the Fullerton-Florida State survivor meets Stanford (50-13) on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time in 25 years the College World Series had  
more than one game rained out on the same day. The last time a game 
couldn't be played because of rain came when the 1985 championship 
was postponed one day. 
</P>
<P>
	Players from Rice and Alabama ate stadium food while they waited  
out two delays and NCAA officials considered whether to play ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the pitchers who weren't going to play today were  
eating funnel cakes and hot dogs and playing cards,'' said 
right-hander Kenny Baugh, who got the victory in Rice's defeat of 
Oklahoma State on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	When the announcement came that there would be no games, the  
Tide players bolted for the bus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't like we weren't out there long enough,'' Alabama  
coach Jim Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
	The extra day gave Rice coach Wayne Graham the option of going  
with ace lefty Mario Ramos (13-2, 2.42 ERA). Graham said he'll 
probably stick with right-hander Jeff Nichols (15-4, 4.94). 
</P>
<P>
	Wells said he's still planning to use right-hander Scott Murphy  
(7-0, 5.52), a freshman. But also available with the extra day's 
rest is opening starter Justin Smith (6-4, 5.91). 
</P>
<P>
	``In the back of our minds, we're thinking along the lines of  
Smith. I just don't really know at this point,'' Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State coach Mike Martin said he considered another start  
for Nick Stocks (12-2, 3.21 ERA), a first-round draft pick by the 
St. Louis Cardinals who pitched into the fifth in a series-opening 
victory over Texas A&AMP;M. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, Martin decided to stick with Chris Chavez, (7-5,  
2.20), who relieved Stocks with the bases loaded and no outs and 
then struck out the side on 14 pitches. Both are right-handers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to stay with Chavez,'' Martin said. ``We had  
kicked around the possibility of going with Nick but he's only had 
three days' rest. He hasn't gone on three days' rest all year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lefty Jon Smith (7-0, 2.71) goes for Fullerton. Until throwing  
into the eighth in an 11-5 victory over Ohio State in the super 
regionals, he pitched only three-plus innings in a seven-week span 
because of a sore left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know he's ready,'' Fullerton coach George Horton said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Titans hit at an indoor batting cage to maintain their  
rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just one more day in the hotel, and we're getting adapted  
to that,'' Horton said. ``When you're winning, you want to get out 
and keep the momentum going. On the other hand, we've got sore guys 
who get more time to rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said the Seminoles spent the day relaxing.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're just playing Nintendo and playing cards in their hotel  
rooms,'' he said. ``They're just being regular college kids.''

<HEADLINE> Coast Guard Conducts Y2K Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- If seafarers don't prepare their ships'  
computer systems for the Y2K computer bug, they may be forced to 
drop anchor outside a harbor or reduce speed on the nation's 
waterways come New Year's. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard officials made the announcement Tuesday after  
finishing a two-day test of systems at the nation's busiest harbors 
-- the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard also outlined its plans to keep the country's  
ports open on Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines, which emphasize preparation and contingency  
plans, will be presented to the United Nations next week in hopes 
that other countries will adopt them, said Adm. George Naccara, the 
Coast Guard's director of information and technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard has been working on its Y2K plans for about two  
years, Naccara said, to keep ports across the country safe and to 
ensure minimal interruptions to the maritime industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our No. 1 concern is safety and the movement of people on the  
waterways,'' Naccara said. 
</P>
<P>
	To prevent collisions, oil spills and traffic jams, the Coast  
Guard will monitor vessels as they move in and out of ports in the 
hours before and after the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K bug may strike then because many older computers are  
programmed to list years in a two-digit format. Computers that have 
not been updated will interpret the ``00'' of the upcoming year as 
1900, causing glitches in some systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard will check its database of vessels to see if a  
ship has contingency plans and if its computer systems, which could 
effect everything from ship navigation to communications, have been 
fixed. Vessels deemed high-risk will face restrictions on their 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In some instances, a ship may be forced to anchor outside a  
harbor if the vessel is believed unsafe. Other restrictions include 
slower speeds for ships in a harbor; one-way traffic lanes to 
reduce the chance of collision; and extra tugboats to help with 
maneuvering.

<HEADLINE> Fraud Lawsuit Filed Against Sears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDWARDSVILLE, Ill. (AP) -- Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. collected up to  
$400 million for tire balancing services it never performed, then 
paid millions to keep the fraud quiet, according to a lawsuit filed 
in Madison County Circuit Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Tuesday, also claims managers destroyed the  
tire-balancing machines with sledgehammers to cover up the fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint, which seeks class-action status, estimates 7  
million to 30 million people who purchased Sears AccuBalance 
service from 1989 to 1994 were potentially defrauded. 
</P>
<P>
	The balancing machines were used to shave off a tiny layer of  
rubber to make sure the tires were round. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears workers typically charged $12.50 to process each tire but  
often skipped the procedure, which was impossible for the buyer to 
detect, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	It also contends Sears management knew that most of the  
balancing services never were performed, but pressured employees to 
sell the services anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Stephen Katz, who represents the plaintiffs, said he  
believes Sears failed to do the work up to 90 percent of the time 
in its 800 tire stores nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears spokesman David Albritton declined comment today on the  
lawsuit, which he said the company had not seen. 
</P>
<P>
	But he noted the case is the same as a federal lawsuit pending  
in Tampa, Fla. That lawsuit was filed in September 1991, thrown out 
and recently reinstated late last year by a federal appeals court 
that ruled notices Sears sent in 1992 for reimbursement of 
``unnecessary and/or improper repairs'' were too vague to be 
understood. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit accuses Sears of paying almost $30 million in ``hush  
money'' to buy the silence of the machine's manufacturer, Assix 
International Inc., of Tampa, Fla., after that company's workers 
reported significant discrepancies between the services Sears sold 
and the work recorded by mechanical counters on the machines. 
</P>
<P>
	Assix leased about 1,300 machines to Sears for $300 per month  
each, plus a royalty of 15 cents on every tire shaved, according to 
court documents. Sears paid Assix based on cash register receipts 
and not the counters, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Sears paid $30 million in cash and property for a $6  
million contract termination settlement and to acquire the 
AccuBalance machines, the lawsuit contends. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit alleges that Sears, based in the Chicago suburb of  
Hoffman Estates, distributed a ``secret video tape'' telling 
workers to destroy the machines and the counters with 
sledgehammers, then sell the remains for scrap. It claims Sears 
also acquired all Assix paperwork regarding its AccuBalance 
machines as part of ``massive cover-up efforts.''

<HEADLINE> Duval-Woods Rivalry Short Some Wins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- David Duval vs. Tiger Woods has all the  
makings of a great golf rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval is the top-ranked player in the world, an icy, methodical  
man who hides his emotions behind a pair of wraparound sunglasses. 
Woods is the No. 2 player in the world, a fiery, fist-pumping icon 
who pushed the game from the country clubs to the inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, they summon images of those who became inextricably  
linked through the brilliance of their games and the harmony of 
their personalities -- Nicklaus-Palmer, Nelson-Snead-Hogan, 
Sarazen-Hagen, Nicklaus-Watson. 
</P>
<P>
	But it might be a little premature to add Duval-Woods to that  
list. After all, they've never gone head-to-head on a Sunday 
afternoon at Augusta National with a green jacket on the line. For 
that matter, Duval has yet to win a major championship of any kind, 
though his record suggests it's only a matter of time. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're arguably the two best players in the game today. I  
don't think there's any question about that,'' Jack Nicklaus said 
Tuesday after a practice round at Pinehurst No. 2, site of this 
week's U.S. Open. ``But I think they both feel like they're not 
playing against each other. They're trying to figure out a way to 
win a major championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods captured his first major title at the 1997 Masters --  
winning by a record 12 strokes -- and ascended to the top of the 
world standings for a 41-week run. But he has yet to win another of 
the Big Four events. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval replaced Woods at the top of the rankings with a  
remarkable run of 11 victories in less than two years, including 
the Tour Championship and The Players Championship. But his best 
showing in a major was tying for second in the '98 Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Tiger is a player, one of several players out here,  
that will always be motivating to other competitors, solely because 
you known you're going to have to improve and get better,'' Duval 
said. ``At the same time, I'm a firm believer that if you need 
motivation from outside sources, you're not going to go very far. 
You have to have inner motivation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval doesn't think his steely approach would change, even if  
he's paired with Woods in the final group on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would speculate that I would be thinking this ... is just  
another person that I have to beat,'' Duval said. ``Now, if that 
comes to pass and I come out of top, I might gloat a little more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the only pairing of Woods and Duval is the ``Showdown at  
Sherwood,'' a made-for-TV, 18-hole exhibition that will take part 
in prime time on Aug. 2 in Thousand Oaks, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``By talking about that match as a rivalry, I think it's blowing  
it a bit out of proportion,'' Duval said. ``It's a one-day match. 
It's a one-day, 18-hole thing, and that does not make a rivalry. 
What it is is a good way to get golf in prime time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coming off two straight victories capped by a dazzling  
short-game show on the final day of the Memorial, Woods is one of 
the favorites at Pinehurst. The course sets up perfectly for his 
game and he seems filled with a quiet confidence as he tries to win 
his second major. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've learned from my own mistakes,'' Woods said before a  
practice round. ``Most important of all is I'm not afraid to go out 
on the golf course and apply what I've learned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval has learned that it's not good to pick up a hot coffee pot  
with a bare hand. He suffered second-degree burns on his right 
thumb and forefinger after the accident at his new home last week, 
forcing him to compete at the Open with bandages on both fingers. 
</P>
<P>
	Heeding a doctor's advice, Duval punctured the wounds with a  
knife after finding it difficult to grip his clubs while chipping 
and putting Monday. He returned to the course Tuesday for an 
18-hole practice round and reported no problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't exactly the greatest of timing, but it looks like  
it's going to be OK,'' Duval said.

<HEADLINE> This U.S. Open Could Be Wide Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- The U.S. Open has a tendency to be  
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Take 156 players and start weeding them out. The vast number who  
have trouble keeping it straight and narrow off the tee are in for 
a short week. Short-game wizards are stripped of their advantage in 
the clumpy collar of rough around the greens. 
</P>
<P>
	If that's not enough, an attitude check is always a good  
indicator. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to love listening to them gripe,'' Jack Nicklaus said.  
``The rough is too high -- check him off. The greens are too fast -- 
check him off. You just check guys off as they complain, because 
they complain themselves right out of this championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, playing in a record 43rd consecutive U.S. Open, has  
been startled by what he has heard this week -- nothing but praise 
for Pinehurst No. 2, nothing but accolades for the way the USGA has 
set up Donald Ross' masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Too bad.  
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to have so many guys who have a chance to win,''  
Nicklaus said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the U.S. Open gets under way on Thursday, no one is quite  
sure what to expect. Occasional rain over the past two days will 
keep the turtleback greens from being as firm as the USGA would 
like, at least until the weekend. The fairways may be more 
generous, the rough not as deep, but the slopes and hollows around 
the greens can be unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps that is what led Greg Norman to call this an ``open''  
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot more players could win this golf tournament than we've  
seen in the past,'' he said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Lee Janzen has already won the U.S. Open  
twice this decade. So has Ernie Els. Tom Lehman has played in the 
final group the past four years, the first player with that 
distinction since Bobby Jones in the 1920s. Colin Montgomerie has 
played the U.S. Open seven times and has been in the hunt four of 
those years. Payne Stewart won in 1991 and was the runner-up to 
Janzen twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, the U.S. Open brings out the best in certain players.  
Pinehurst may bring out a different breed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this Open championship is going to let some players  
who maybe don't drive the ball quite as straight or have a great 
short game come into the mix,'' said Mark O'Meara, who has missed 
the cut nine times in 17 Opens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say it's wide open, but I think you're going to see  
some familiar names at the top of the leader board after the first 
few days -- and you're going to see some new names right 
alongside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much depends on the weather.  
</P>
<P>
	The USGA can put the pins in the nastiest spots on greens that  
are actually much smaller than they appear because of the slopes 
around the edges. It can grow the rough any way it wants -- 3 
inches, this week. But it cannot control what falls from the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain is in the forecast at least through parts of the first  
round, which may be the best chance to post a low score. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what's going to happen Thursday is one in this field  
is going to play very well, and score very well. ... I'm talking a 
5-under type of a day,'' Montgomerie said. ``But God help us the 
next day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No matter the conditions, the same cast of characters figure to  
be in mix. O'Meara prefers to consider those who have been playing 
well, and his house guest for the week immediately comes to mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods has never fared too well in the U.S. Open,  
especially compared with the other majors. Still, he has won the 
last two times he teed up -- against five of the top 10 players in 
the world in Germany, then against a strong field in the Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	With the rough cut at only 3 inches this week at Pinehurst -- and  
the USGA swears it will stay that height all week -- it's obvious 
why Woods is beaming. 
</P>
<P>
	``In previous U.S. Opens, I wasn't hitting the ball as good,''  
Woods said. ``I was able to chip and putt and get it around good 
enough where I was making cuts, but I wasn't in contention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In some respects, a U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2 could turn into  
a chipping contest. Although the green can be reached out of the 
rough from as many as 180 yards away, getting it to stop might be 
close to impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Even from the fairway, no one expects to hit every green in  
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	David Duval got his first look at No. 2 on Monday and squeezed  
in two practice rounds with tape around the blister burns on his 
fingers. It reminded him of another Ross design, Timuquana Country 
Club in Jacksonville, Fla., where he learned the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``They always seem to be a good golf-and-chip challenge for any  
type player,'' Duval said of Ross courses. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps that will allow Jose Maria Olazabal to become the first  
player since Nicklaus in 1972 to win the Masters and U.S. Open in 
the same year. Olazabal displayed a masterful short game at 
Augusta, and certainly Pinehurst will give him plenty of 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	But Olazabal hasn't cornered the market on chipping and putting.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of players here that their short games are  
really good, good enough to get something out of this golf 
course,'' Olazabal said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, that could be anybody.

<HEADLINE> D-Backs Place Swindell on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Arizona Diamondbacks placed left-handed  
reliever Greg Swindell on the 15-day disabled list Wednesday and 
purchased the contract of reliever Ed Vosberg from Triple-A Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
	Swindell bruised his left rib cage when he crashed into the wall  
shagging fly balls before last Sunday's game in Anaheim. Manager 
Buck Showalter said he hopes Swindell will be able to rejoin the 
team June 30 when the Diamondbacks open a three-game series in 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Vosberg, also a left-hander, signed a Triple-A contract with  
Tucson last Thursday after being released by the San Diego Padres. 
He had no decisions with a 9.72 ERA in 15 appearances with the 
Padres. He is a 1983 graduate of the University of Arizona and 
still lives in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
	Vosberg pitched three innings with Tucson, striking out six,  
walking none and giving up three hits, before getting the call from 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little surprised,'' he said. ``But you never know in  
this game. A lot of times things happen unexpectedly. I just hoped 
to get some innings in down there and get back in a groove and just 
get an opportunity. That's all you can ask for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona is Vosberg's sixth major league team. He had stints with  
San Francisco, Oakland, Texas and Florida. He was with Florida the 
final seven weeks of the 1997 season and worked four times in the 
postseason, including two appearances in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great situation here,'' Vosberg said. ``This is a  
good team and I just hope to be part of it from here on out. If 
it's only for a week or two, that's fine, but I just want to let 
them know I can pitch and hopefully I can help out some way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vosberg is the second 37-year-old left-handed reliever to join  
the Diamondbacks in less than a week. The Diamondbacks acquired Dan 
Plesac from Toronto in a trade on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices Unchanged in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer prices held steady in May following a  
major jump in April and the good news today set off a buying spree 
on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Falling energy prices balanced rising food costs to help keep  
the Consumer Price Index flat last month, the Labor Department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Core prices -- which exclude the volatile energy and food  
categories and are the most closely watched by economists -- rose a 
modest 0.1 percent as clothing and auto prices declined and medical 
and housing costs edged up. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, the annual rate of inflation felt by consumers  
is 2.6 percent, compared to a 1.6 percent rise for all of 1998, the 
smallest in a dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first half hour of trading today, the Dow Jones average  
of 30 blue-chip stocks soared nearly 150 points and by early 
afternoon added another 30 points. The technology-heavy Nasdaq 
index rallied by more than 85 points. 
</P>
<P>
	On the bond market, which had been bracing for signs of  
rekindled inflation, open-market interest rates fell further from 
last week's 19-month high. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds quickly 
fell to 6.04 percent from 6.11 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The May calm came after consumer prices rose an unexpectedly  
sharp 0.7 percent in April. A record increase in energy prices led 
that upward swing. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Federal Reserve officials, after a May 18 meeting,  
issued a warning that if inflation persists, they are more likely 
than not to raise interest rates later this year. That would make 
credit more expensive, likely slowing the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's next meeting is scheduled for June 29-30. Many  
economists, however, believe that central bank officials will wait 
at least until later in the summer before deciding whether to take 
any action on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inflation returned to dormancy in May,'' said Bruce Steinberg,  
chief economist with Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. in New York. ``Recent 
remarks by Fed officials make it seem that they are hell-bent on 
tightening. But there is not much of a rationale that comes out of 
recent data.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other reports released today that the Fed may be watching to  
gauge the health of the economy: 
</P>
<P>
	--Industrial production, which is making a fragile recovery from  
a slump in global demand caused by economic troubles abroad, edged 
up 0.2 percent in May, the smallest increase since February. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve said the modest production gain at the  
nation's factories, mines and utilities reflects a sharp increase 
in output of automotive products, which partially offset a large 
drop in the production of appliances. 
</P>
<P>
	--Construction of new housing rebounded in May, increasing 6.3  
percent to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 1.676 million units 
after falling 9.7 percent in April, the Commerce Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the April spike in prices was surprisingly large, it  
was not totally unexpected and many analysts have predicted more 
moderate inflation for the rest of this year 
</P>
<P>
	Prices are expected to rise as other countries begin to recover  
from nearly two years of global financial turmoil and world demand 
picks up. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy prices dropped 1.3 percent in May after a record 6.1  
percent jump in April. Gasoline prices fell back 2.7 percent after 
a 15 percent rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The April energy price spike, caused mainly by a spring  
agreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to 
limit production, had been expected to be temporary. 
</P>
<P>
	Electricity and natural gas prices also declined in May,  
although fuel-oil prices continued to edge up slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	Food prices, meanwhile, rose 0.4 percent in May, building on a  
0.1 percent April rise. The cost of fresh vegetables was up 4.9 
percent and fresh fruit prices rose 1.5 percent. Meat prices rose 
0.2 percent overall, although poultry prices were down 1.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Clothing prices fell 0.2 percent in May, with the cost of  
footwear down 1.3 percent. Computer prices also dropped, by 1.9 
percent. The apparel and computer industries continue to be 
affected by stiff competition from low-priced imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of new cars and trucks also fell in May, by 0.1  
percent, and public transportation costs dropped 1.5 percent. 
Airline fares fell 2.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of tobacco and smoking products declined 1.4 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	Among prices that increased in May: The cost of housing was up  
0.1 percent with rents rising 0.2 percent. And the price of medical 
care rose 0.2 percent with prescription drug prices climbing 0.4 
percent. Drug prices are rising at a 6.1 percent annual rate so far 
this year.

<HEADLINE> US Soccer Player Adjusts to New Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINSVILLE, N.J. (AP) -- Sorry, folks, there won't be any  
streaking by Briana Scurry this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry, the veteran goalkeeper for the U.S. women's soccer team,  
won't be making any naked dashes through the streets outside the 
Rose Bowl if the Americans win the World Cup. She won't be matching 
her nude run after the U.S. gold medal at the 1996 Atlanta 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time, I'll be ordinary and keep my clothes on,'' Scurry  
said with a laugh Tuesday following the U.S. team's practice 
session in preparation for Saturday's opening game against Denmark 
at Giants Stadium. ``That was just a weird thing, a weird 
promise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after the Americans beat China 2-1 in Athens to win the  
Olympics, Scurry made a short scurry while stark naked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, I took my clothes off in a car and ran down the street  
and ran back, and I have proof. I videotaped it,'' she said. ``I 
ran about 20-30 feet down the road. It was a little nerve-racking. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very funny and one time only.''  
</P>
<P>
	How about if the rest of the team agreed to join her in a  
similar celebration in Pasadena, Calif., on July 10 if the favored 
Americans take their second world title? 
</P>
<P>
	``Trying to get them to do that would be like pulling teeth,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry isn't exactly the most overworked goalie in the world.  
She's played in 89 internationals and can't count how many were 
easy affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, she'll take six more games in which she could stretch  
out on a lounge chair and watch the Americans control play. And, of 
course, she knows that won't happen in this tournament, which 
should be the most competitive in women's soccer history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love it! When my team is down in the other end, I love it,''  
said Scurry, 27, who is 10-2 this year, allowing only eight goals 
and getting six shutouts. ``It's fine with me if we are dominating. 
I couldn't have a bigger smile on my face. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult at times when another team gets a breakthrough,  
but I'm trained to handle tough shots when they come at me. The 
more bored I am, the better. I'd like to be bored out of my tree 
for the whole World Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don't count on it. The Americans know they will have to count on  
Scurry to come up with a key save at some point in the tournament. 
There is no lack of confidence that she'll make that stop. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's done it for us when we've needed it,'' defender Carla  
Overbeck said. ``Bri is one of the best goalies in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry might not say that, but she certainly appreciates hearing  
it. She readily admits she doesn't measure up with some other 
goalies in two specific areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I'm as strong with my footwork as some others,  
and that's because I never played much in the field,'' she said. 
``I've been nothing but a goalie since I was 16, and I hardly got 
into the field before that, even when I wanted to and we were ahead 
by five or six goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm also not as strong with my kicks as some of the Europeans.  
But I think I can hold my own with anyone as an all-around 
goalie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What she really wants is to be the World Cup-winning goalie,  
even if she isn't best keeper in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great we have so much talent and character on this  
team,'' Scurry said. ``Because of that, sometimes I have a very 
easy job.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar, Tokyo Stocks Prices Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen late  
Wednesday in lackluster trading because investors held off ahead of 
the release of a key U.S. economic report. Tokyo stocks also fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.05 yen late Wednesday afternoon in Tokyo,  
down 0.10 yen from late on Tuesday and below its late New York 
level of 120.40 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 71.82  
points, or 0.42 percent, to close at 17,210.18. On Tuesday, the 
average gained 93.18 points, or 0.54 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar stayed in a narrow range as the market awaited the  
May U.S. consumer price index for signs of inflation -- a clue to 
whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	With growing sentiment that the Japanese economy is poised for a  
recovery, as well as anticipation that the Fed will tighten 
monetary policy, market participants are generally inclined to bid 
up the Japanese currency, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, trading was stuck in a narrow range between 120.05 yen  
and 120.65 yen as the Bank of Japan and other financial authorities 
signaled that Japan will prevent excessive gains by the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's central bank is moving to prop up the dollar amid  
concerns that a strong yen could stifle economic recovery by 
driving up the prices of Japan's exports and making foreign imports 
cheaper domestically. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be difficult for the dollar to break below 120 yen,''  
said Kazuo Watanabe, deputy general manager of the treasury 
department at Sumitomo Bank Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading on the stock market was also quiet ahead of release of  
the U.S. consumer price index later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Lingering pessimism about the health of the economy among  
Japanese institutional investors also dragged on share prices, said 
Kunihiro Hatae, general manager at Tokyo Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange ended down 1.90 points, 
or 0.14 percent, at 1,383.17. The TOPIX closed up 3.80 points, or 
0.28 percent, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 692 million shares traded on the first section, up  
from 584 million on Tuesday. Rising and declining shares were 
evenly split. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 125.18 yen, up from  
125.04 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.615 percent from Tuesday's 1.595 percent, driving 
its price down to 98.14 yen from 98.31.

<HEADLINE> 6 Miles of Cooking Oil Cleaned Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORANGE CITY, Fla. (AP) -- The odor of stale french fries and  
greasy chicken filled the air after cooking oil leaked from a truck 
and turned six miles of road slippery. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire department, alerted to Tuesday's spill by skidding  
motorists, spread sand over the oil. There were no serious 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	The goop leaked from a truck owned by a recycling company that  
reclaims cooking oil from restaurants. Investigators said the spill 
was probably caused by driver error, not a problem with the truck. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount spilled was not immediately known. The truck can  
carry about 3,500 gallons.

<HEADLINE> FBI Arrests Longtime Fugitive Soliah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A long-sought member of the Symbionese  
Liberation Army was arrested Wednesday, 25 years after the 
terrorist group kidnapped newspaper heiress Patty Hearst and most 
of its members died in a shootout, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen Ann Soliah, who was known in St. Paul as Sara Jane  
Olson, a married mother of three, was arrested without incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Soliah, 52, was indicted Feb. 26, 1976, by a grand jury in Los  
Angeles on felony charges including conspiracy to commit murder of 
police officers and possession of explosives. Soliah was involved 
in bombings and bank robberies with other SLA members, the FBI 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, on the 25th anniversary of the deadly SLA shootout  
in Los Angeles, the FBI offered a $20,000 reward for Soliah, and 
she was featured on the television show ``America's Most Wanted.'' 
Wednesday's FBI announcement didn't say what led to the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents from Minneapolis and Los Angeles carried out  
Wednesday's arrest with help from St. Paul and Los Angeles police. 
</P>
<P>
	The Olson family lives in a well-kept, ivy-covered home.  
Neighbors said Sara Olson lived with her physician husband and 
their three daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is America, where everyone is innocent until proven  
guilty,'' neighbor Ron Whitcomb told WCCO Radio of Minneapolis. ``I 
stand by the Constitution. Having been an old 1960s war protester 
myself, let's see how it all shakes out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He described the Olsons as ``quiet, very unassuming neighbors.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Hearst case was one of the most sensational news stories of  
the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLA, a band of leftist radicals, kidnapped the  
then-19-year-old Hearst from her Berkeley, Calif., apartment in 
February 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	The group, whose symbol a seven-headed snake, demanded that  
Randolph and Catherine Hearst distribute $2 million worth of food 
to the needy before it would discuss releasing their daughter. The 
demand later climbed to $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The May 17, 1974, shootout and fire was watched live on  
television across the nation. The group's leader, an ex-convict who 
called himself Cinque, and five other heavily armed members died 
when they were trapped by police in a house. 
</P>
<P>
	But then Hearst metamorphosed into Tania, a member of the very  
group that took her prisoner. Two months after the kidnapping, she 
was photographed carrying a carbine during a SLA bank holdup in San 
Francisco -- the robbery for which she eventually was tried, 
convicted and sent to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst went underground. There were scores of sightings, but she  
didn't re-emerge until Sept. 18, 1975, when she was arrested in San 
Francisco along with two associates, Bill and Emily Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she claimed she was the victim of brainwashing, she was  
convicted in a highly publicized trial and sentenced to seven years 
for the bank robbery. She served about two years before President 
Carter commuted her sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, she's a married mother living in Connecticut, and a  
sometime actress and author. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst was granted immunity from prosecution for her admitted  
role in the April 21, 1975, robbery of a Crocker Bank branch in the 
Sacramento suburb of Carmichael in which a woman was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, Hearst, who was waiting in a getaway car outside  
the bank, told authorities that Kathleen Soliah and her brother, 
Steven, took part in the holdup, along with several other members 
of the SLA. Steven Soliah was acquitted by a jury. 
</P>
<P>
	In another sensational fugitive case, Katherine Ann Power,  
antiwar radical implicated in a fatal bank robbery in Boston in 
1970, turned herself in in 1993 and pleaded guilty to manslaughter. 
Taking an alias, she had eventually settled near Corvallis, Ore., 
where she taught, worked as a chef, married and bore a son. With 
continued good behavior in prison, she was scheduled to be released 
in January 2000.

<HEADLINE> Samaranch Aims To Reassert Authority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The boss of the Olympics says he's  
still in control, and will stay in control, as the organization 
follows its own plan to recover from its worst scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch  
dispelled rumors of an internal plot against him, reiterated he 
intends to complete the final two years of his term and declared 
the IOC won't rush into reforms to appease critics. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech at the opening ceremony of the 109th IOC general  
assembly, Samaranch said Wednesday the committee already had taken 
important steps toward reform following the Salt Lake City bribery 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	But he stressed the IOC would move at its own pace and on its  
own terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We say `yes' to reforms necessary to consolidate the Olympic  
movement, without renouncing our convictions,'' he said. ``We say 
`no' to hasty reforms to please our critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``No to reforms which defend the interests of some at the  
expense of others. No to reforms based on personal and conflicting 
interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the speech, Samaranch sought to erase any further speculation  
that he might retire early. 
</P>
<P>
	``My concern is to leave to my successor, at the end of my term  
in 2001, an institution which is over 100 years old, solid and 
beyond reproach,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, in a breakfast meeting with a small group of reporters,  
Samaranch was eager to put across the same point. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not leaving,'' he said. ``I have decided to go until the  
end of my mandate. The only thing that can stop me is if I don't 
have the confidence of IOC members or if I am ill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch dismissed recent published reports that senior members  
of the IOC administration have plotted against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Always we have rumors,'' he said. ``I am not worried. Nothing  
has happened. ... In an organization like ours, we have to be used 
to rumors. But rumors are rumors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch denied there was a split in the administration at IOC  
headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, and expressed support for 
director general Francois Carrard. 
</P>
<P>
	He also refuted suggestions of a rift with IOC vice president  
Dick Pound, who has publicly speculated that Samaranch might retire 
after reforms are made at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch confirmed that he had written Pound expressing dismay  
at the remarks and that Pound had sent a reply. But he denied a 
French newspaper report that Pound, a leading contender to succeed 
him as president, had told him it was time to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a minor incident,'' Samaranch said. ``He has my full  
confidence. I respect him very much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who has been president since 1980 and turns 79 next  
month, released a letter signed by the 10 members of the executive 
board -- including Pound -- endorsing his continued leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``In these difficult times of crisis wrought with danger, a  
strong, wise, trusted leadership is essential,'' the letter said. 
``We unanimously support you ... and ask you to continue to devote 
your time to the Olympic movement as president of the IOC, until 
the end of your present mandate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who has faced numerous calls for his resignation from  
newspapers and critics outside the IOC, said he had survived the 
worst of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you compare these days to the last weeks, this is a  
vacation for me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-day IOC session gets under way Thursday, with reports  
from organizers of the 2000 Sydney Olympics and 2002 Winter Games 
in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the IOC will elect the host city of the 2006 Winter  
Games. The six cities in the all-European race are Helsinki, 
Finland; Klagenfurt, Austria; Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia; Sion, 
Switzerland; Turin, Italy; and Zakopane, Poland.

<HEADLINE> Longshot Oolong Wins Sire Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The longest shot on the board,  
Oolong at 31-1, overcame the outside post position to win the 
$100,000 New Jersey Sire Stakes Championship Final for 3-year-old 
trotting fillies on Wednesday night at the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer, co-owner and driver Per Henriksen lagged Oolong up to  
the starting gate then moved to the pylons as Witching Wind, who 
hung on for third, cut the early fractions, taking the field 
through three-quarters of a mile in 1:27 1-5. Henriksen saved 
ground with the filly before fanning out to the middle of the track 
for the charge to the wire. 
</P>
<P>
	Oolong finished a neck ahead of Dream Valley OM. Oolong posted  
her third lifetime victory and second in a row in a career-best 
1:56 2-5 for a mile. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a little scared of something and didn't get on gait  
right,'' Henriksen said. ``So I pulled her left and saved her. ... 
I knew I had horse, but I also knew I had a lot of ground to make 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oolong paid $65, $23.40 and $9.80. Dream Valley OM returned $18  
and $8.60 and Witching Wind was worth $5.

<HEADLINE> LJ Makes No Difference For Knicks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Larry Johnson hardly made a difference for  
the New York Knicks in Wednesday night's NBA Finals opener against 
the San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, nursing a sprained right knee, scored only five points  
and committed five fouls as the Knicks lost to the Spurs 89-77. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been a doubtful starter until shortly before gametime,  
but decided to play and seemed to have more problems with fouls 
than he did with the knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a wrap instead of the heavy brace that had protected the  
knee during a morning shootaround, Johnson started the game 
guarding 7-foot David Robinson. In 2 minutes, 11 seconds, he was 
whistled for a pair of fouls and went to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in and out of the game after that, logging just 21  
minutes and going 1-of-3 from the field and 3-of-4 from the foul 
line for five points. It was far below his playoff average of 12.7 
points per game. He also had just one rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	When he came out of the game for keeps in the fourth quarter, he  
seemed to be favoring the knee but refused any treatment on the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
	The sprained right knee wasn't Johnson's only problem. He also  
had his right elbow and left knee wrapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who was injured last Friday in the final game of the  
Eastern Conference finals against Indiana, decided to play 
following the afternoon shootaround. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a tough guy,'' New York Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said,  
``so I was not surprised. He feels he can be effective so he's 
giving it a shot. We wanted him out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there wasn't much he could do to help the Knicks, even  
though he seemed to have little trouble getting up and down the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Johnson strolled into the shootaround with  
no limp, no grimace, no sign that his right knee wasn't right -- 
except for the huge brace. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not bad,'' he said. ``We've got a ways to go. It's a  
matter of what I can and can't do and when I can help the team. If 
I can be productive at 50 percent, I'll go out there at 50 percent. 
I may be more than 50 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks are already playing shorthanded because of Patrick  
Ewing's season-ending injury, a tear of the Achilles' tendon.

<HEADLINE> Study Tracks NIH Funding by Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A study suggests that diseases like AIDS and breast cancer get a  
disproportionately large share of federal research dollars in 
relation to the toll they take on public health. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published in Thursday's New England Journal of  
Medicine and conducted by researchers at Johns Hopkins University, 
is the first systematic comparison of National Institutes of Health 
funding for specific diseases and the burden imposed by these 
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the study found a strong correlation between NIH  
funding in fiscal 1996 and the years of life lost to disability and 
death from 29 diseases in the world's industrialized nations -- a 
measure called disability-adjusted life-years, or DALYs. 
</P>
<P>
	That's good news for NIH, said Dr. Cary Gross, who led the  
study. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people have been critical of the NIH for quite a  
while in saying their funding allocation was arbitrary,'' Gross 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the study found that diseases with strong political  
lobbies -- especially AIDS -- got more money according to the DALY 
measure than diseases with less-vocal advocates, such as emphysema 
and depression. 
</P>
<P>
	AIDS got $1.4 billion in grant money in fiscal 1996 and was  
estimated to lead to the loss of 1.27 million DALYs -- about $1,114 
per DALY. Breast cancer received $381.9 million for 1.42 million 
DALYs, or $269 per DALY. Depression got $148.8 million for 8.4 
million DALYs, or $17 per DALY. Emphysema got $62.4 million for 
2.28 million DALYs, or $27 per DALY. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found a pretty good correlation between NIH  
funding and two other, commonly used measures of the burden of 
disease: deaths caused and years of life lost to premature death. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gross said the DALY measure is superior because it better  
captures the effect of chronic, debilitating diseases like mental 
illness and diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauri Flynn, executive director of the National Alliance for the  
Mentally Ill, said the study suggests what mental health advocates 
have long claimed -- that research into mental illness is not as 
high a priority as it should be. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see ourselves as historically underfunded,'' she said. ``It  
would certainly gladden my heart if they took some of this 
information into the equation more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, scientists and advocates warned that using the study to  
conclude that NIH is pouring too much money into AIDS research 
would be a huge mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	AIDS is not the most burdensome disease in the industrialized  
world, but it is deadly, infectious and rampant in Africa and parts 
of Asia, said Daniel Zingale, head of AIDS Action. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a global pandemic that threatens to bring down entire  
nations, and America is the leader in medical research in the 
world,'' Zingale said. ``If you make the error of simply looking at 
it as dollars for deaths, you could come to some rash 
conclusions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jeffrey Laurence, a Cornell University researcher and  
adviser to the American Foundation for AIDS Research, also noted 
that AIDS research has led to breakthroughs in other diseases, such 
as new drugs for hepatitis B and C -- two other disabling, worldwide 
viral epidemics. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the money that's being spent on AIDS research has broad  
benefits for other diseases,'' Laurence said. 
</P>
<P>
	A government advisory group, the Institute of Medicine,  
recommended such a cost comparison be done. About one-third of 
NIH's $15.6 billion budget is spent on disease-specific research; 
the rest supports basic science. 
</P>
<P>
	Leon Rosenberg, chairman of the committee that recommended the  
comparison, said that the study provided important information but 
that it would be foolish to use the burden of disease as the sole 
criterion for funding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm concerned about the use of these data'' by advocacy  
groups, he said. ``But the alternative is worse -- namely, to wall 
scientific decision-making off from any public scrutiny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Harold Varmus, the head of  
NIH, also cautioned that NIH considers many factors when awarding 
grants, including whether a big push in a particular area is likely 
to yield major scientific gains or public health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Advocacy groups have tended, understandably, to focus their  
attention on alleged inequities between the toll of a specific 
disease and spending for research on that disease,'' Varmus wrote. 
``These claims are of great concern to the NIH, because they 
threaten to undermine the agency's credibility, and to Congress, 
because they challenge its oversight in a politically sensitive 
area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Donald Mattison, medical director of the March of Dimes,  
which gives out about $25 million years in grants to study birth 
defects, said some categories used in the study are misleading. He 
noted, for example, that some research counted as alcohol and 
diabetes funding looked at the effects of fetal development and 
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, I'm pleased with the way NIH has funded,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Indian Tribes Sue Tobacco Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- American Indian tribes are intensifying  
their demand on Big Tobacco to repay the cost of treating what they 
insist are smoking-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-four tribes, mostly from the West and Midwest, filed suit  
today in state court accusing the tobacco industry of deliberately 
targeting Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes less than two weeks after 20 tribes and pueblos  
filed a $1 billion federal lawsuit in San Francisco charging they 
were excluded from the settlement reached between states and the 
industry in November. 
</P>
<P>
	In that settlement, the tobacco industry agreed to pay 46 states  
more than $200 billion over 25 years to recover Medicaid costs for 
treating smoking-related illnesses. The tribes were not included. 
</P>
<P>
	``They got no money. They got no benefits of the settlement.  
They had no one representing them at the table,'' said Turner 
Branch, an Albuquerque attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	The new lawsuit also sought an end to tobacco advertisements  
that target Indian teen-agers. Tribal attorneys say damages could 
reach into the billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit named more than a dozen tobacco companies, including  
Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds and the Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Co., 
which distributes American Spirit cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the 1998 surgeon general's report, about 39 percent  
of American Indians smoke. That compares to 26.5 percent of blacks, 
25.9 percent of whites, 18.9 percent of Hispanics and 15.3 percent 
of Asian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a problem because we have never been educated about the  
dangers of smoking,'' said Red Eagle Rael, governor of the Picuris 
Pueblo in northern New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The legal arguments used by Indian tribes may have to be  
different from those employed seven months ago by the states, which 
sought the recovery of Medicare and Medicaid costs caused by 
tobacco use. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the states, however, the federal government generally  
pays for health-care costs on Indian reservations. John Phillips, 
an attorney representing Philip Morris Co., said that fact could be 
a problem for the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tribes have received their health funding -- the vast  
majority of the funding -- through the Indian Health Services, which 
is an arm of the federal government,'' Phillips said. ``Those are 
federal monies, not tribal monies. Only the federal government, not 
the tribes, (has) the right to sue for those funds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albert Hale, a former Navajo Nation president and counsel to the  
law firm filing the lawsuit, disagreed. The federal government must 
allocate money for Indian health services as part of its treaties 
with the tribes, Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The moment it is appropriated, it is Indian money,'' he said.  
``It loses that federal-money label.''

<HEADLINE> Quindlen To Be Newsweek Columnist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Celebrated author Anna Quindlen will be joining  
Newsweek as a regular columnist to replace longtime commentator Meg 
Greenfield, who died last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Quindlen's pieces, which will appear in Newsweek starting in  
October, will alternate with essays by George Will. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Wednesday, Quindlen said she initially turned  
down the offer, but soon reconsidered. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more I thought about it, the more I thought that it was a  
fantastic venue that would offer me a public forum and not 
interfere too much with my fiction writing,'' she said. ``It just 
was too good an offer to say no to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quindlen worked at The New York Times for 18 years, much of the  
time as a columnist, but left in 1995 to write novels full time. 
She won a Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Her recent books include ``Siblings,'' ``How Reading Changed My  
Life'' and ``One True Thing,'' which became a movie starring Meryl 
Streep and William Hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsweek chairman and editor-in-chief Richard M. Smith said  
Quindlen would be an excellent successor to Greenfield, who had 
written for the magazine since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anna's wonderfully creative mind, her no-nonsense thinking and  
her unerring sense of justice and injustice have made her one of 
the most powerful voices of her generation,'' he said. ``She will 
be a superb successor to our beloved Meg, and a source of great 
insight and joy to Newsweek's readers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quindlen said she would continue to focus about the topics she  
wrote about on the Times op-ed page, including health care, child 
care and welfare reform. But she expected more space and less 
frequent deadlines would let her go into greater depth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives me a little bit of breathing room as a writer that  
I'm really looking forward too,'' she said. ``More like an essay, 
less like a column.''
