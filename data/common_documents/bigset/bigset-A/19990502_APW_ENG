<HEADLINE>  3 Race Spectators Killed by Debris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Three spectators were killed and at least  
eight injured when struck by debris that flew into the stands after 
a three-car crash in the VisionAire 500 Indy Racing League event 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Spectators sitting in the area where the crash occurred said a  
tire and suspension parts flew into the fourth-turn grandstands at 
Lowe's Motor Speedway and struck the spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	Speedway officials early Sunday identified two of the spectators  
killed as Randy D. Pyatte, 21, and Jeff Patton, no age available, 
both of Connelly Springs. 
</P>
<P>
	Area hospitals reported treating at least eight people,  
including one child who was in critical condition. Hailey McGee, 9, 
of Conover, was flown to Carolinas Medical Center in nearby 
Charlotte with bruises to her brain and lungs. Also flown to 
Carolinas was Jeremy Jones, no age given, of Connelly Springs. He 
was listed in serious condition with a chest injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Three adults flown to University Hospital in Charlotte were  
listed in good condition. Wesley J. Rice, 29, of Newton, had a 
stomach injury; Matthew J. Picklesimer, 26, of Claremont, had a 
head laceration, and Amanda R. Shondelmyer, 11, Hickory, had a head 
laceration and an injured right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the injured were transported by ambulance to Northeast  
Medical Center in Concord. Nathaniel Blosser, 19, of Hickory, was 
treated for a puncture wound and released and David Duncan, 27, of 
Newton, was treated for a shoulder injury and also released. Chad 
Duncan, 22, of Conover, David's brother, was held overnight because 
of a leg injury but hospital officials said he likely would be 
released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	As rescue workers were attending to the injured, the track  
canceled the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a terrible thing,'' said speedway president H.A.  
``Humpy'' Wheeler, who went into the stands where the debris landed 
and tried to comfort some of the spectators. ``It's very 
regrettable. It's something we'll live with for a very, very long 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ninety minutes after the crash, the nearly 50,000 spectators had  
filed out of the track and investigators were working at the 
accident scene, taking measurements and roping off the area. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1.5-mile superspeedway's sprawling infield, about 200  
drivers and crew members gathered for a somber prayer service. 
</P>
<P>
	``My teammates and I are just full of sorrow,'' 1998  
Indianapolis 500 winner Eddie Cheever said. ``Our thoughts and 
prayers are with the individuals and families. The decision to stop 
the race was the right one. We all leave Charlotte with extremely 
heavy hearts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul Jr. and Stan Wattles slammed hard into the fourth-turn  
retaining wall on lap 61 of the 208-lap event and went spinning 
down the front stretch, collecting the car of Scott Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
	Television replays could not show conclusively what kind of  
debris flew into the stands. But Joe Tiano, a Hickory resident who 
was sitting about 150 feet away in a neighboring section of stands, 
said a wheel and suspension parts flew into the seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``It came up here like a rocket and then started bouncing  
around,'' Tiano said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities cleared the section of the stands and the race was  
red-flagged while emergency workers attended to the injured. While 
medical personnel worked, track security employees stood around 
them holding up white sheets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody who was taking pictures had their cameras taken away  
by the cops,'' Tiano said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the spectators who died was sitting in the 15th row, and  
the other two appeared to be about 10 rows higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Within minutes of the crash, the three drivers were examined at  
the infield care center and released, and about 15 minutes later, 
Wheeler went on the public address system to tell fans the race was 
being canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never done anything like this before,'' Wheeler said.  
``But it seemed like the right thing to do in respect to those who 
lost their lives up there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The incident was similar to an accident last July in which three  
spectators were killed by debris after a racing crash at Michigan 
International Speedway. The track later increased the height of its 
catch fences by 2 1/2 feet, to 17 feet, in an effort to prevent a 
recurrence. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte's catch fences were raised to 15 feet in 1997 in  
preparation for the track getting its first IRL race. Charlotte has 
been holding NASCAR Winston Cup races since it opened in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheeler and IRL founder Tony George, who joined him at a hastily  
arranged news conference after the race was canceled, said they 
were unsure from which car the tire came. The cars of both Wattles 
and Paul were missing tires after the crash, but Wattles' impact 
occurred the closest to where the spectators were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hearts go out to everyone up in the stands,'' Wattles said  
after he was released from the infield care center. 
</P>
<P>
	They were the first spectator fatalities in the history of the  
track and the IRL, which was founded in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte allows spectators to sit in all rows of the track's  
seats for Winston Cup races, but for IRL races the speedway bans 
fans from sitting in the bottom seven rows closest to the racing 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Charlotte's been one of the leaders in protecting and  
taking care of their spectators,'' said Leo Mehl, executive 
director of the IRL.

<HEADLINE> Sharks Head Home Down 3-2 to Avs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Down 3-2 in their first-round playoff  
series to the Colorado Avalanche, the San Jose Sharks return to the 
San Jose Arena where they lost the first two games of this 
postseason series. 
</P>
<P>
	Down 0-2 in this delayed series, the Sharks then won the next  
two at Denver before the Avalanche came back to take Saturday 
night's game 6-2 at home. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks got what they needed in Colorado: a chance to bring  
the best-of-seven series back to California. If the Sharks win on 
Monday night, Game 7 will be played back in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Sharks have a daunting task. They are underdogs to the  
Avalanche no matter where they play. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't happy with our performance, but we came in and won  
two out of three and kept the series alive,'' San Jose forward Jeff 
Friesen said. ``We take the series back to the Shark Tank and will 
go back to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Center Mike Ricci agreed. Perhaps the home-ice advantage would  
work in San Jose's favor this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still a lot of hockey to be played,'' Ricci said.  
``This wasn't their fourth win and that's the positive. They need 
four wins and we need four wins. All we're thinking about right now 
is getting three.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks also face a suddenly rejuvenated Theo Fleury, who was  
fairly quiet early in the playoffs but came back with two goals and 
an assist Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a matter of time,'' Fleury said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche, however, weren't looking past Monday's game  
despite their advantages, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a long ways from over,'' he said. ``They're going to  
bring their best game Monday. ... We've got one hockey game to win, 
and it's the hardest one to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharks coach Darryl Sutter gambled and put Steve Shields in goal  
Saturday, giving Mike Vernon a night off. Vernon has won Stanley 
Cups with Calgary and Detroit over the course of his career, but 
Shields was hot down the stretch of the regular season, going 9-0-2 
in his last 11 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Sutter wasn't about to second-guess himself after the Game 5  
loss. Because of the delayed schedule, Vernon, 36, was facing a 
possible seven games in 11 nights. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was probably going to have one bad night if he did that, so  
we're probably better off that this was how it turned out,'' Sutter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The series was supposed to have started in Denver, but was  
delayed because of the mass shooting at Columbine High School. 
Instead, the first two games were played in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	Vernon, no doubt, will be back for Game 6. He wasn't dwelling on  
what might have been, had he been in goal Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why it's called a team game,'' he said. ``Everybody  
contributes. We just weren't prepared as a team tonight. Now we 
have to regroup.''

<P>
	Today is Monday, May 3, the 123nd day of 1999. There are 242  
days left in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	On May 3, 1802, Washington, D.C., was incorporated as a city.  
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1916, Irish nationalist Padraic Pearse and two others were  
executed by the British for their roles in the Easter Rising. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1921, West Virginia imposed the first state sales tax.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1944, U.S. wartime rationing of most grades of meats ended.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1945, Indian forces captured Rangoon, Burma, from the  
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1948, the Supreme Court ruled that covenants prohibiting the  
sale of real estate to blacks or members of other racial groups 
were legally unenforceable. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1971, anti-war protesters began four days of demonstrations  
in Washington, D.C., aimed at shutting down the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, ``Sun Day'' fell on a Wednesday as thousands of people  
extolling the virtues of solar energy held events across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1979, Conservative Party leader Margaret Thatcher was chosen  
to become Britain's first female prime minister as the Tories 
ousted the incumbent Labor government in parliamentary elections. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, in NASA's first post-Challenger launch, an unmanned  
Delta rocket lost power in its main engine shortly after liftoff, 
forcing safety officers to destroy it by remote control. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: PLO leader Yasser Arafat, ending a two-day visit  
to France, said the PLO charter calling for the destruction of 
Israel had been ``superseded'' by a declaration urging peaceful 
coexistence of the Jewish state and a Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: President Clinton presided over a televised  
forum from Atlanta, during which he denied suggestions he'd 
vacillated on foreign policy, but said global problems were more 
difficult than he'd imagined. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: Space shuttle Columbia and its crew returned to  
Earth, ending two weeks of lab work that advanced brain research. 
After a daylong squabble, European leaders meeting in Brussels, 
Belgium, agreed on Wim Duisenberg of the Netherlands as the chief 
of the new European Central Bank, but with the proviso that he step 
down in 2002 to make way for Frenchman Jean-Claude Trichet. ``The 
Sevres Road,'' by landscape painter Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot, 
was stolen from the Louvre. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Birthdays: Broadway librettist Betty Comden is 80. Folk  
singer Pete Seeger is 80. Country singer Dave Dudley is 71. Singer 
James Brown is 66. Singer Engelbert Humperdinck is 63. Singer 
Frankie Valli is 62. Sports announcer Greg Gumbel is 53. Magician 
Doug Henning is 52. Singer Christopher Cross is 48. Country 
musician Cactus Moser (Highway 101) is 42. Actress Jill Berard 
(``Hiller and Diller'') is 9. 
</P>

	Thought for Today: ``If you want anything said, ask a man; if  
you want anything done, ask a woman.'' -- Margaret Thatcher, former 
British prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Weather Patterns, Warming Linked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scientists looking for signs of global warming should spend more  
time scrutinizing Earth's weather circulation patterns, a new study 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers who studied northern winters since mid-century found  
that a weather pattern favoring typically milder winters was two to 
three times more likely to arise in the mid-1990s than around 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings suggest that global warming blamed on human  
industry is manifesting itself not just by causing a global rise in 
temperatures but by also favoring certain established weather 
patterns. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is telling us that we shouldn't expect to see unusual  
patterns we've never seen before. That's something the atmosphere 
is very reluctant to do. You'll just get certain patterns becoming 
more likely and other patterns being less likely,'' said Tim N. 
Palmer of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts 
near Reading, England. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer and two colleagues from the Interuniversity Computing  
Centre in Bologna, Italy, studied atmospheric circulation data for 
winters in the Northern Hemisphere from 1949 to 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	They charted air circulation patterns into four ``clusters'' of  
high and low pressure systems, finding that the grouping favoring 
mild winters arose more frequently while patterns causing severe 
winters occurred less often. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were published in the April 29 issue of the journal  
Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	They mean climatologists should devote more time to scrutinizing  
shifts in the natural variability of weather circulation patterns 
to understand global warming, said Tom Karl, director of the 
National Climate Data Center in Asheville, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these patterns now seem to have the odds loaded in  
their favor of occurring with more frequency and intensity,'' Karl 
said. ``This points out the importance of looking more closely at 
the patterns of climate circulation that affect the day-to-day 
weather we all experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a U.N.-sponsored  
network of more than 2,000 scientists monitoring the global 
climate, has concluded that there is a ``discernible human 
influence'' on the climate through the burning of fossil fuels, 
which produce greenhouse gases. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Trenberth, who heads the climate analysis section at the  
National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., said 
Palmer's findings don't prove or disprove whether human activity is 
affecting the climate. But he said evidence that the frequency of 
some weather patterns is changing shouldn't be overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly a step along the way in terms of making people  
think of things in a different way and ask different types of 
questions,'' he said. ``Global warming won't be a simple warming of 
the Earth. It's bound to be more complex than that.''

<HEADLINE> Girl's 'Petworld' Game Gets Licensed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Creativity, faith and a lot of hard work let  
11-year-old Casey Smith parlay an elementary school project into a 
board game that will soon be sold in major stores nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey used magic markers and cardboard three years ago to create  
Casey's Petworld -- a Monopoly-style board game in which players 
collect, and sometimes lose, money and pets -- as a classroom 
project. Her mother, an artist, helped with the graphics. 
</P>
<P>
	The invention changed the lives of Casey -- short for Cassandra --  
and her mother, LeAnn, forever. 
</P>
<P>
	The Minneapolis girl, with mother in tow, spent four days at the  
American International Toy Fair in February helping Cadaco Inc., a 
Chicago game manufacturer, introduce the game to big-name toy 
retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	For Casey, a fifth-grader, that meant long days in the Cadaco  
booth talking with retail buyers and a news conference where she 
showed off her invention to the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``She did the whole spiel, showed them how it was played, did  
the sales speech. She was at the booth most times from 8 o'clock in 
the morning to 5 o'clock. She was a pro,'' her proud mother said. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey said the fair was fun.  
</P>
<P>
	``People were real supportive. They thought it was great. The  
other inventors came by and said, 'You've done a great job with 
this,' '' Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith became the backstage mom after she and her daughter  
licensed Petworld to Cadaco for manufacture and distribution. 
Cadaco is rolling out the game nationally the first week of May to 
coincide with Be Kind to Animals Week. 
</P>
<P>
	The company already has Petworld orders from FAO Schwartz, Zany  
Brainy, Learning Express, some Target stores and specialty toy 
stores, said Don Light, Cadaco's national sales manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every year there's probably hundreds of board game invention  
opportunities for big companies. Very few actually get to market,'' 
Light said. ``This is one of the few that actually made it through 
everything and made it to market. That's a real accomplishment for 
Casey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casey, who has two rats, a bird, a cat and fish at home, built  
the game around her favorite subject -- pets. Petworld, intended for 
young school-age children, incorporates reading, counting, 
exchanging money and learning pet responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Smiths were on their own when they took Petworld to the  
Javits trade show during the New York Toy Fair in February 1998, 
manufacturing the game in small numbers and doing their own sales 
and marketing from home. 
</P>
<P>
	They caught the eye of George Oess, Cadaco's president.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're a privately owned smaller company ourselves. We live by  
our wits so I like to look for things that already have had a 
little bit of success,'' Oess said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also liked the story behind Petworld.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith, a single mom, quit her job as a salad and sandwich chef  
and borrowed $30,000 from friends and family to put the game on the 
market. On their own, the Smiths had sold about 4,500 games at 
small specialty stores around the country and locally through two 
major retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said she didn't have the money to properly market the  
game, so she decided to team with Cadaco, a 64-year-old company 
that could do the job. The deal also would enable Smith to pursue 
her own interest in computer graphics. 
</P>
<P>
	Petworld was licensed to Cadaco for a guaranteed royalty on  
sales and a lump sum, ``which took the company pretty much out of 
debt,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thinking about the bills that I owed was really hard on me.  
That was one of the reasons that it was licensed,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadaco is doing a first production run of 10,000 games, and  
plans three or four runs before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel if we give this game a lot of nurturing, Casey could  
have a best-selling game sold throughout the United States,'' Oess 
said. Cadaco has low overhead and can stay with a game that might 
take a while to catch on, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Oess said the game plays well and the topic is timeless.  
</P>
<P>
	``For us, that's better than looking for something that's going  
to be here today, gone tomorrow,'' he said. ``It's not often that a 
little girl creates something that becomes commercially successful. 
We've got pretty high hopes that it will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casey encourages other kids to put their own imaginations to  
work, because ``you never can tell where your ideas might take you. 
If you have what it takes and you have a strong will, go for it.''

<HEADLINE> Right Dream, Wrong Horse at Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Eduardo Caramori's Kentucky Derby dream  
came true -- for D. Wayne Lukas. 
</P>
<P>
	Caramori said he dreamed the winner would come out of the No. 16  
post, and when it came his turn to pick a post position Wednesday 
the trainer chose 16 for First American. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, however, Aljabr, who drew No. 5, was scratched,  
meaning every horse from No. 4 out moved in one place. So First 
American started from the No. 15 post, and the Lukas-trained 
Charismatic started from No. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the 1 1/4 miles Saturday at Churchill Downs,  
Charismatic was first by a neck over Menifee, and Lukas had his 
fourth Derby victory and 11th triumph in a Triple Crown race. 
</P>
<P>
	First American finished, you guessed it, 16th.  
</P>
<P>
	An early celebration by Chris Antley, riding Charismatic for the  
first time, could have proved costly. 
</P>
<P>
	``He got excited and gave the No. 1 sign three jumps from the  
wire,'' Lukas said Sunday. ``If Menifee had caught us, that finger 
would be in glass in formaldehyde in the barn right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas had told anyone who would listen that Charismatic was  
improving rapidly and would be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	One who listened, and believed, was Lukas' sister, Dauna Moths.  
</P>
<P>
	``My sister, bless her heart, said she wanted to bet $30  
across,'' Lukas said. ``She bet 10, 10 and 10.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mutuel clerk, however, punched out three $30 tickets (win,  
place and show). 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic paid $64.60, $27.80 and $14.40. The win payoff was  
the third highest in 125 Derbys, behind Donerail's $184.90 in 1913 
and Gallahadion's $72.40 in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief, Charismatic's more highly regarded stablemate,  
finished third in the 19-horse field. He was 1 1/4 lengths ahead of 
Prime Timber, trained by Bob Baffert, who was trying to become the 
first person to three straight Derbys. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to tell it's the first time I've rooted for a Lukas  
horse, in those last 50 yards,'' Baffert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic is owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis, who own Silver  
Charm, Baffert's first Derby winner. 
</P>
<P>
	The first four Derby finishers will run in the Preakness on May  
15 at Pimlico. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be Charismatic's fourth race in six weeks. But, Lukas  
said, ``He should bounce back. I think he can handle it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert said the filly Silverbulletday, winner of the Kentucky  
Oaks, also is being pointed to the Preakness, but that his other 
Derby starters, the filly Excellent Meeting and General Challenge, 
will get a rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting, 15th with a quarter mile left, finished  
fifth. The strapping General Challenge finished 11th. Baffert said 
the gelding got a lot of dirt in his eyes, and ``it looked like he 
was dragging his right leg, but he's OK today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race was roughly run, and a lot of horses came out of it  
with cuts and bruises. Many were blocked or forced to race wide and 
never got into contention. 
</P>
<P>
	The filly Three Ring was bumped at the start, then her saddle  
slipped and she was out of it quickly. She finished 19th. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been really lucky all these years,'' said Baffert, who  
has two wins and a second in four Derbys. I got the (trouble-free) 
trip. Yesterday, I didn't get the trip with any of my three 
horses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Preakness is limited to 14 starters, and Baffert said he  
would like to see the 20-horse Derby limit reduced. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee's trainer, Elliott Walden, who also finished second with  
Victory Gallop to Baffert's Real Quiet last year, said of 20 
starters being allowed, ``I might win it some day because another 
horse gets in trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They call it a roller Derby, it's rough,'' Lukas said. ``But  
that's what makes it unique.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scotty Schulhofer, trainer of Lemon Drop Kid (ninth), said  
jockey Jose Santos told him, ``Don't be disappointed. He had to run 
1 3-8 miles in a 1 1/4-mile race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid is going to the Preakness and so are the Nick  
Zito-trained Stephen Go Even (14th) and Adonis (17th). Zito said 
it's the most disappointed he's been after a race because neither 
colt got a chance to really run. 
</P>
<P>
	It is possible Worldly Manner, making his first official start  
after only a trial race in Dubai, will go in the 1 3-16-mile 
Preakness. The colt was bought for $5 million by the Maktoum 
family's Godolphin Racing stable after he won the Del Mar Futurity 
on Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Others expected for the Preakness include Derby Trial winner  
Patience Game, Talks Cheap, winner of Pimlico's Federico Tessio, 
and Millions.

<HEADLINE> Real Estate Firms Grapple With Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- For sale: Dream house with white picket  
fence, large back yard. Near outstanding schools. In good 
neighborhood, except for convicted child molester next door. 
</P>
<P>
	Megan's Law, which requires public notification when a child  
molester, rapist or other convicted sex offender moves into a 
community, has real estate agents wondering whether they must 
disclose the presence of pedophiles to prospective home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie Janik, an attorney for the National Association of  
Realtors in Chicago, says real estate agents in most states are 
looking for clarification wherever they can get it -- from the 
government, lawyers, the insurance industry -- to avoid legal 
liability. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no necessarily right answer in a lot of these gray  
areas,'' says Janik, whose organization represents 720,000 real 
estate agents nationally. In most cases, she says, the agents do 
not know where sex offenders live. ``Then the issue is: Do they 
have any duty to find out?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The industry is in a quandary. On one hand, agents depend on the  
commissions they make selling houses, and they represent owners who 
want the best prices for their properties. If an agent discloses 
that a sex offender lives nearby and the property value drops or 
potential buyers evaporate, the seller may sue. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, if an agent representing a potential  
homebuyer fails to mention that a convicted child molester lives in 
the area and the molester attacks a member of the new family, that 
family might also file suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Laws in Alaska, California and Virginia require real estate  
agents to advise home buyers -- in writing -- about local law 
enforcement agencies, databases or other sources where they can 
learn the whereabouts of sex offenders. The agents have won 
exemptions from any responsibility in Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, 
Minnesota, Nevada, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	In Connecticut, pending legislation would require agents to  
include on standard disclosure forms any resources that would help 
homeowners ferret out information on child molesters. Similar 
legislation has been proposed in other states. 
</P>
<P>
	Megan's Law is named for 7-year-old Megan Kanka, a New Jersey  
girl who was raped and murdered in July 1994 by a convicted sex 
offender who lived across the street. Her parents didn't know their 
neighbor was a pedophile and waged a national campaign to make 
public certain information on convicted sex offenders. Requirements 
vary among states. 
</P>
<P>
	After states began passing such laws, the real estate industry  
unsuccessfully lobbied the Justice Department for a regulation that 
would free agents from obligations to disclose the information. 
Now, the agents are lobbying legislators nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	In most states, real estate law requires that agents disclose  
``material facts'' that may be detrimental within the ``four 
corners'' of a property, such as a leaky roof or old pipes. The 
question is whether a sex offender living down the block falls into 
the same category. 
</P>
<P>
	Courts in some states have ruled that ``material facts'' may  
extend beyond property lines. A New Jersey judge, for example, 
ruled that nearby hazardous waste must be divulged to home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Cook, publisher of the Real Estate Intelligence  
Report/Agency Law Quarterly, says the fear and stigma of a sex 
offender in the neighborhood may be impossible to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your resale value goes to hell if a child molester moves in  
down the block. If you had the choice, why would you move next to 
that guy?'' he asks. 
</P>
<P>
	In states where the laws are unclear, agents hope their  
insurance will cover any homeowner suits. Most agents have what is 
known as ``errors and omissions insurance,'' which generally covers 
them in the event they give bad advice or misrepresent facts they 
knew or should have known about a house. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the insurance industry came up with ``errors and  
omissions,'' insurers didn't have sex offenders in mind, says 
Daniel Zielinski of the American Insurance Association in 
Washington, D.C. The court system ultimately may have to resolve 
the issue, he adds.

<HEADLINE> Panel Meets on Olympic Ethics Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- An eight-member ethics panel,  
including former Senate Majority leader Howard Baker and former 
U.N. chief Javier Perez de Cuellar, prepared Sunday for the first 
of a series of meetings intended to clean up the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics commission was established last month in response to  
the Salt Lake City bribery scandal, in which 10 International 
Olympic Committee members were expelled or resigned for receiving 
improper inducements during the campaign to win the right to stage 
the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	It is meant to help the IOC study the Olympic bidding and  
selection process, ensure accountability and enforce compliance 
with a new code of conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission will report the outcome of its opening  
discussions Monday to an IOC executive board meeting the following 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the items up for discussion will likely be the fate of  
Australian IOC member Phil Coles, who has already received a ``most 
severe warning'' from the IOC for receiving travel and 
accommodation perks from Salt Lake City. He is under renewed 
scrutiny since his ex-wife claimed that members of Athens 
unsuccessful bid for the 1996 Olympics gave her jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
	It may also discuss the case of South Korean executive board  
member Kim Un-yong, who also received a ``most severe warning'' and 
is the highest-ranking official implicated. Kim could face 
expulsion if the IOC proves he knew that the Salt Lake committee 
paid for his son's salary at a telecommunications company. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics committee is chaired by IOC vice president Keba Mbaye  
of Senegal, a former vice president of the International Court of 
Justice. The other members are French Sen. Robert Badinter, former 
Swiss President Kurt Furgler, former Canadian Olympic athlete 
Charmaine Crooks and IOC executive board members Kevan Gosper of 
Australia and Chiharu Igaya of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker was a member of the U.S. Senate from 1967-85 and Perez de  
Cuellar was U.N. chief from 1982-91.

<HEADLINE> Silent Classics To Be Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hundreds of silent-movie classics including  
``The Phantom of the Opera,'' ``The King of Kings'' and rare 
footage of W.C. Fields are heading to the auction block. 
</P>
<P>
	The prints of more than 1,500 films come from the Silent Movie  
Showcase in Hollywood, the country's only movie theater dedicated 
to silent films, which closed in January 1997 after a gunman killed 
the theater's owner, Lawrence Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	Other titles expected to be up for auction include ``The  
Hunchback of Notre Dame'' and a collection of Laurel and Hardy 
films including ``Two Tars'' and ``Dr. Jack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the 16mm and 35mm silent films were given to the  
theater's original owner by Charlie Chaplin, D.W. Griffith and 
Cecil B. DeMille. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale was scheduled for May 23-24 by the auction house  
Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin was killed by Christian Rodriguez, who was hired by the  
theater owner's business partner, James Vansickle. Rodriguez got a 
life sentence. Vansickle, also convicted of murdering Austin, is 
awaiting sentencing.

<HEADLINE> Dole Takes Centrist Gun Control View </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole staked out a centrist  
position on gun control, setting her apart from most of the GOP 
presidential field, as eight Republican candidates tried Sunday 
night to take advantage of George W. Bush's absence from New 
Hampshire's unofficial kickoff to the 2000 primary season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you need an AK-47 to defend your family,'' Mrs.  
Dole said, receiving a smattering of polite applause. The reception 
was even cooler when the former American Red Cross president said 
she supported child safety locks on handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	One crowd member booed. Few applauded.  
</P>
<P>
	And in what aides said what challenge to the National Rifle  
Association, a powerful GOP-leaning lobby, Mrs. Dole promised she 
would be tough on crime ``no matter what the special interests 
say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state GOP dinner, which drew 1,200 party activists, was  
billed as the first major Republican event of the 2000 campaign in 
this first-in-the-nation primary state. 
</P>
<P>
	Three likely candidates failed to attend: Arizona Sen. John  
McCain, TV commentator Pat Buchanan and Bush. McCain was 
celebrating his son's 13th birthday; Buchanan was campaigning in 
Arizona; Bush, Texas' governor, has refused to campaign outside his 
state until the legislative session ends later this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Many activists who attended the kickoff questioned or criticized  
Bush's decision to pass up the event. Yet most predicted it would 
not change his front-runner status. 
</P>
<P>
	For the rest of field, the gathering offered a chance to shine  
outside Bush's shadow. Their goal is to emerge as alternative pick 
should Bush falter. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole's was the boldest attempt at creating news and drawing  
attention to her campaign. Wearing a clip-on microphone, she stood 
several feet from the podium -- spinning on her high heels to 
address the crowd that surrounded her. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she supports the continuation of the assault-weapons  
ban, elimination of bullets that pierce bulletproof vests and full 
federal funding of instant background checks for gun buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole's remarks seemed designed to bolster her standing as  
the No. 2 Republican candidate in national polls; restrictions on 
the availability of guns are popular among independent and moderate 
voters, especially women. 
</P>
<P>
	The gun debate has heated up in the wake of the Colorado school  
shootings, a tragedy mentioned by several of the GOP hopefuls. Gun 
control is a prickly issue for Republican candidates because 
conservative voters tend to oppose it, particularly in an 
independent-minded state like New Hampshire, and the National Rifle 
Association is a powerful lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	Typical of the GOP field was Steve Forbes, who wandered a foot  
or two from the podium to say the Littleton, Colo., shootings show 
that people are capable of ``great good and great evil.'' Yet, in 
stark contrast to Mrs. Dole, he said the country must ``resist the 
temptation to enact new laws'' in response to such tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle, avoiding the gun debate,  
argued that he deserves the nomination. ``Who has been fighting for 
your values and your families for over 20 years? Who has the 
experience when it comes to foreign policy and who has been tested 
and has the courage to lead this great country of ours?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Kasich of Ohio portrayed himself as the candidate who  
would ease ``the frustrations of everyday working people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Smith, a native son with little chance of winning the  
nomination, bragged that he voted to impeach President Clinton and 
attacked Republicans who didn't. 

</P>
<P>
	By challening the NRA, Mrs. Dole adopted a strategy used by  
President Clinton in the 1996 presidential campaign to court 
moderate voters from both parties. Aides say they were not troubled 
by the cool reaction Sunday because Mrs. Dole is trying to expand 
the party's base by targeting moderate voters, not party regulars. 

</P>
<P>
	Bush has struggled to make his position on gun control clear,  
though he says he supports instant checks on weapons bought at gun 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole's rivals said the school shootings are a symptom of  
declining values. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Tennesse Gov. Lamar Alexander, promising to make raising  
children easier if elected, said ``the culture is tougher. It's 
getting harder to grow up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative activist Gary Bauer, who announced his candidacy  
the day after the shootings, said America is a great country, ``but 
if we do not remember that America was built on God ... nothing 
else will matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a wide lead in polls, it seems Bush can afford to miss an  
opportunity to court New Hampshire Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a chance to show a lot of people that he is for  
real,'' said Ron Woermer, 51, a Nashua, N.H., marketing director. 
Still, he is open to backing Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looks like a winner, doesn't he?'' Woermer said with a smile.

<HEADLINE> 'Entrapment' Nabs Top Film Spot / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Powered by sexual chemistry, exotic locations  
and Sean Connery's roguish charm, the cat-burglar thriller 
``Entrapment'' nabbed the top spot at the weekend box office with 
$20.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The film, starring Catherine Zeta-Jones as an insurance  
investigator who seduces a high-class art thief played by Connery, 
knocked ``The Matrix'' down to No. 2 with $8.7 million, industry 
estimates showed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Entrapment'' benefited from strong advertising in which a  
leotard-clad Zeta-Jones slinks through a web of laser beams and 
Connery performs stunts reminiscent of his days as James Bond, said 
Robert Bucksbaum, a movie analyst with Reel Source Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sean Connery has been around forever and has a lot of star  
power. Adult women wanted to see him, and young men wanted to see 
her,'' he said. ``It had all the elements of a hit written all over 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The horror-comedy ``Idle Hands,'' the only other film opening in  
wide release this weekend, grossed a disappointing $1.8 million, 
tying for sixth place with ``10 Things I Hate About You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The story of a pot-smoking teen who slays his friends because a  
demon has possessed his hand may have suffered from macabre 
comparisons to the killings at Columbine High School in Littleton, 
Colo., Bucksbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They may have backed off a little on their marketing campaign  
because teen-agers killing other teens would have turned off a lot 
of people,'' he said. ``People didn't feel like seeing a movie like 
this so close to that incident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Comedies dominated the rest of the top 10, with the Eddie  
Murphy-Martin Lawrence prison movie ``Life'' earning $6.4 million 
for third place. 
</P>
<P>
	The Drew Barrymore high school comedy ``Never Been Kissed''  
continued to do well but dropped to fourth place with $4.2 million, 
while the mobster-in-therapy movie ``Analyze This'' fell to fifth 
with $2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Having already grossed $98.5 million, ``Analyze This'' has  
inched its way toward becoming the second film of 1999 to cross the 
$100 million mark. The first was ``The Matrix,'' which has earned 
$129.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	After a disappointing opening, two other comedies plummeted to  
the bottom of the top 10 in only their second week of release. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pushing Tin,'' starring John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton as  
frantic air traffic controllers, earned $1.3 million for eighth 
place. ``Lost &AMP; Found,'' featuring David Spade as a smarmy 
dognapper, opened in ninth place with $1.28 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Weekend ticket sales were 4.5 percent higher than the same  
weekend last year, when ``Titanic'' dropped out of the top 5 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Inc., with final figures 
to be released Monday: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Entrapment,'' $20.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``The Matrix,'' $8.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Life,'' $6.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Never Been Kissed,'' $4.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Analyze This,'' $2.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``10 Things I Hate About You,'' $1.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Idle Hands,'' $1.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Pushing Tin,'' $1.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Lost &AMP; Found,'' $1.28 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Go,'' $1.2 million.

then-Attorney General Kennedy spoke at the University of Waseda in 
Tokyo.

	``He was so impressed by that speech that he had an ambition to  
be a politician,'' said Tsuyoshi Yamamoto, first secretary of the

	Obuchi came to the United States the following year and wanted  
to meet Kennedy. He made his request to Novello, who was Kennedy's

<HEADLINE>  Bulls Bask in Win Over Miami Heat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- It's easy to imagine the reaction by M.J., Scottie  
and the Worm when they saw the score. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumbfounded disbelief. And then delight.  
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan and company always loved to beat the Heat, and  
that's what the Chicago Bulls did Saturday. The defending NBA 
champions lived up to their billing for a change by shocking Miami 
101-86. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat were without Alonzo Mourning, sidelined by an eye  
injury, but so what? The Bulls were without Jordan, Scottie Pippen 
and Dennis Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	``When M.J. calls, I'm going to say I know how he feels some  
nights,'' Bulls guard Ron Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper scored 25 points, all in the second half, and the team  
with the worst record in the Eastern Conference beat the 
first-place Heat, jumbling the playoff picture. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning and coach Pat Riley watched from opposite ends of the  
Heat bench, mirror images of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not disappointed. I'm not discouraged. I'm just absolutely  
disgusted,'' Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami fans felt likewise. They expected the Bulls to play as  
poorly as that other dismantled championship team, the Florida 
Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, in keeping with spring tradition, Chicago dealt Miami  
another crushing defeat. The Heat have made the playoffs five 
times, and three times -- in 1992, 1996 and 1997 -- they were 
eliminated by Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Heat and Bulls go back years,'' Harper said. ``There have  
been a lot of hard-fought games, so this one feels good for all of 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The win left the Bulls a bit giddy in the locker room. Someone  
wrote ``Machine-Gun Harper'' on the blackboard. Toni Kukoc 
pretended to drink cologne in celebration. Dickey Simpkins became 
almost incoherent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've lost games this season by a lot of money -- I mean  
points,'' Simpkins said. ``There's nothing better than beating 
Miami by double figures on their court at crunch time. We feel 
great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls started two obscure rookies and took the court with  
the worst offense in the NBA. They had scored a league record-low 
49 points in losing to Miami just three weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	But by halftime, Chicago had 48 points -- and the lead. Sparked  
by Harper, they built the margin to 22 points in the third period 
and never faltered in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls repeatedly took advantage of Mourning's absence by  
driving inside, and then Harper got hot from the outside. After 
missing his only shot in the first half, he finished 9-for-14, 
including 4-for-7 from 3-point range. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I've seen Ron Harper play like that in a long  
time,'' Riley said. ``He was saving one for us, because he was 
absolutely extraordinary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls made half their shots for only the second time all  
season, sinking 58 percent, the best effort against Miami in 
Riley's four years as coach. Chicago exceeded its scoring average 
by 19 points and topped 100 for just the third time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Bulls fans enjoyed this game,'' Kukoc said with a  
broad grin, perhaps feeling the effects of the cologne. 
</P>
<P>
	Also happy were the Orlando Magic, Indiana Pacers and Atlanta  
Hawks, all trying to overtake Miami for the conference 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though we're not going to the playoffs, it's important to  
establish some momentum for next season,'' Simpkins said. ``Why not 
come in and mess up someone else's playoff chances and try to gain 
some respect at the same time?'' 
</P>
<P>
	So if Saturday's win wasn't exactly Game 7 of the NBA Finals, it  
was the Bulls' biggest victory since then. 
</P>
<P>
	``By far,'' Harper said. ``We enjoyed beating Miami.''  
</P>
<P>
	In Chicago, that's one thing that hasn't changed.

<HEADLINE> Hackman, Freeman To Film Mystery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman are  
getting mixed up in a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
	The two are to begin filming a remake of the French murder  
mystery ``Garde a Vue'' in Puerto Rico later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	In the film, to be titled ``Under Suspicion,'' Freeman will play  
a police chief who investigates the murder of a woman found dead 
during a street festival. Hackman plays the prominent attorney who 
finds the woman's body. The film also stars Italian actress Monica 
Bellucci. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's basically the story of three people and the complexities  
that it generates,'' Hackman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The original French film, based on the novel ``Brainwashed'' by  
John Wainright, debuted in 1972.

<HEADLINE> Law Student Proves Rivera Wrong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- A law school student is waiting for his  
payoff for proving Geraldo Rivera wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Last September, on his CNBC show ``Rivera Live,'' Rivera said  
criminal prosecutions aren't brought for lying about sex, and 
offered $10,000 to anyone who could prove him wrong. He made the 
challenge as he discussed the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve A. McCloskey, 46, a law student at North Carolina Central  
University, checked the computer databases and found about a dozen 
such cases. 
</P>
<P>
	McCloskey sued Rivera in March for breach of contract when the  
network wouldn't pay. Three weeks later, NBC agreed to pay 
McCloskey the $10,000 and an extra $86 for court costs and postage. 
McCloskey declared victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``After winning my first case with somebody like NBC, I hope  
it's not all downhill from there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third payment NBC has made resulting from Rivera's  
challenge.

<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Maurizio Ganz scored with seconds remaining  
on a shot that deflected off the hand of defender Marcello 
Castellini, giving AC Milan a 3-2 victory over Sampdoria of Genoa 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	With three games remaining, AC Milan (17-4-10) remained one  
point behind Lazio of Rome (18-5-8), won 3-0 at Udinese on goals by 
Sinisa Mihajlovic, Christian Vieri and Roberto Mancini. 
</P>
<P>
	AC Milan, in search of its fifth title of the 1990s, plays at  
Juventus of Turin next week, when Lazio is host to Bologna. Lazio's 
lone league championship came in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	AC Milan stretched its unbeaten streak to eight, but not before  
struggling all afternoon against a Sampdoria side that is 17th in 
the 18-team league and played the entire second half a man short. 
</P>
<P>
	AC Milan went ahead in the 17th minute on Massimo Ambrosini's  
25-yard shot, his first goal since November 1997. Sampdoria 
defender Saliou Lassissi was ejected at the end of the first half 
for fouling Ganz, but Sampdoria (7-15-9) tied it in the 59th on 
Vincenzo Montella's header off a corner kick. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonardo put AC Milan back ahead on a 20-yard free kick with 12  
minutes to go, but Marco Franceschetti's first goal of the season 
tied the score with four minutes remaining. The winning goal came 
in the fifth minute of injury time. 
</P>
<P>
	At Udine, Mihajlovic converted a penalty kick in the 29th after  
Mancini was fouled by Valerio Bertotto. Vieri (48th minute) and 
Mancini (57th) added goals on headers. The win was Lazio's 
team-record eighth on the road this season. 
</P>
<P>
	In other games, Fiorentina routed Perugia 5-1, Parma edged  
last-place Empoli 1-0, Salernitana upset Juventus 1-0; Bari beat 
Piacenza 3-1, Cagliari topped Bologna 3-1 and Vicenza beat Venezia 
2-1. Internazionale of Milan's game at AS Roma was pushed back to 
Monday because of a papal beatification.

<HEADLINE> Duke Not Ready To Throw in Towel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- It was supposed to be his last try at a  
political comeback. But David Duke, having fallen short by fewer 
than 4,000 votes in his bid for Bob Livingston's congressional 
seat, was unwilling to say ``never again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former Ku Klux Klan leader and author of ``My Awakening,''  
an autobiographical call for ``Aryan revolution,'' told a crowd of 
about 150 disappointed supporters that he was not ready to fade 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not ruling anything out for the rest of my life,'' he said  
during a grudging Saturday night concession speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke had said several times before Saturday's Louisiana  
elections that this would be his last campaign if he did not win. 
</P>
<P>
	Running as a Republican in Louisiana's unique open primary  
system, he came in third behind two of the state's GOP stalwarts: 
former Gov. Dave Treen, making his own political comeback 15 years 
after he left office; and David Vitter, a two-term state 
representative who won passage of a constitutional amendment 
limiting state legislators to three four-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Treen and Vitter will meet in a May 29 runoff to decide who will  
finish Livingston's term. Livingston was in line to become House 
Speaker after more than 20 years in Congress, but he abruptly 
announced his resignation in December after confessing to marital 
infidelities. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Republican Congressional Committee is relieved that  
Duke was rejected, said its chairman, Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va. ``He's 
out of it, thank goodness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Duke's best showing since the 1991 governor's race, when  
he displaced faltering incumbent Buddy Roemer and won a runoff spot 
against three-term former Gov. Edwin Edwards. Edwards trounced Duke 
in the runoff and Duke's political fortunes fell precipitously with 
a weak run for the Republican presidential nomination, an abandoned 
try for governor in 1995 and a fourth-place showing in the 1996 
U.S. Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Duke benefited from a relatively light turnout of  
about 36 percent and a splintered vote among the seven Republicans 
and two Democrats, all conservatives. He also was buoyed by white 
middle-class voters who feel threatened by affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
	``He ran much better than I thought he would. He ran much better  
than everyone thought he would,'' said Wayne Parent, political 
scientist at Louisiana State University. 
</P>
<P>
	Complete but unofficial returns showed Treen with 36,547 votes,  
or 25 percent, and Vitter with 31,652 votes, or 22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke had 27,967 votes, or 19 percent. Ophthalmologist Monica  
Monica, also a Republican, received 22,855 votes, or 16 percent. 
State Rep. Bill Strain, a Democrat, received 16,372 votes, or 11 
percent. Four other candidates split the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Most polls had shown Duke with no more than 10 percent support,  
demonstrating Duke's oft-repeated campaign mantra: ``I fly under 
radar,'' meaning his supporters are reluctant to acknowledge their 
choice to pollsters. 
</P>
<P>
	That was evidenced even by one of the 150 who attended his  
would-be victory party Saturday night in suburban Metairie. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon, who would not give her last name, confessed to some  
discomfort with Duke's KKK history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't entirely trust him, but a lot of the things he says I  
do support,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's victors promised a clean campaign -- unlike the final  
days before the runoff, when each was drawn into a vitriolic series 
of attack and counterattack ads. Treen turns 71 in July and Vitter 
has said the ex-governor is ``biologically term-limited.''

<HEADLINE> Twin Astronauts Won't Share Shuttle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) -- Scott Kelly couldn't wait to share  
the news: He was going to space. 
</P>
<P>
	First, the astronaut called his wife. Then he walked down the  
hall and told his brother. 
</P>
<P>
	His twin brother.  
</P>
<P>
	His identical twin brother.  
</P>
<P>
	His identical twin astronaut brother.  
</P>
<P>
	Not only are Scott and Mark Kelly both space shuttle pilots,  
they both are also test pilots, combat pilots, Navy lieutenant 
commanders, engineers, married to blondes, with 4-year-old 
daughters on the same soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only are they the world's first astronaut twins, they're  
also the only astronaut siblings. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't expect any sibling rivalry, though. The 35-year-old Kellys  
haven't gone head-to-head since they were teen-agers competing for 
girls back home in West Orange, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Mark is handling the launch invitations and party plans  
for his brother. ``It's wonderful to have a brother, no less a twin 
and they're in the same job, who is so supportive,'' says their 
father, Richard Kelly, a retired police captain. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the family says, there was nothing but brotherly pride  
when NASA called Scott in March and offered him the job of piloting 
the mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	The telescope's deteriorating pointing system prompted NASA to  
move up its next regularly scheduled visit to October, eight months 
early. NASA already had assigned the mission's four spacewalkers, 
but needed a flight crew fast. 
</P>
<P>
	Either brother could have been tapped for the single pilot slot;  
both were awaiting their first flight assignments. But Scott was 
picked because he had been trained in rendezvousing in space. 
</P>
<P>
	``They made the second-best choice. Ha-ha. Just kidding. Yeah, I  
mean it's great,'' says Mark, his brother grinning at his side. 
``Obviously, one of us was going to fly first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Did they take bets on who it would be?  
</P>
<P>
	``Nope,'' is the joint reply. ``The bottom line is it really  
doesn't matter to either of us,'' adds Scott. ``I mean, I'm happy. 
I'm glad it's me instead of him. But if it wasn't me, I would wish 
it would be him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers are quick to point out that flying first has its  
disadvantages. They figure all the relatives and family friends 
will travel to Cape Canaveral, Fla., for Scott's Oct. 14 launch 
aboard Discovery. By the time Mark rockets away in the next year or 
two, many of the guests probably won't go back. Plus, Mark will be 
at the pre-launch party while Scott is stuck in quarantine. 
</P>
<P>
	Mission commander Curtis Brown Jr. jokes that although he can  
tell the balding, mustachioed Kellys apart, ``I had Scott promise 
that he wasn't going to skip out and have his brother substitute in 
unless I knew about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers claim they have never impersonated each other and  
that the only time they dress alike is when they wear their blue 
astronaut jumpsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mark did borrow Scott's new business suit when he went for  
his astronaut interview at the Johnson Space Center in Houston in 
1995. Scott wore the same suit for his interview a month later -- 
and borrowed Mark's shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the more than 2,400 people who applied for NASA's Astronaut  
Class of '96, 35 were chosen, including the Kelly twins. (Jim 
Kelly, no relation, also was picked.) 
</P>
<P>
	NASA knew in advance that both twins were applying, but insists  
they were picked because of their equally impressive credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're down to picking twins to help NASA's image, then  
we're in deep trouble,'' observes commander Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Scott and Mark Kelly will never fly together in space  
or take part in any twin research aloft: too gimmicky, says NASA's 
top doctor, Arnauld Nicogossian. 
</P>
<P>
	Flying has always been in the brothers' blood.  
</P>
<P>
	When they were 8, three years after man landed on the moon, they  
told their grandmother, ``Grandma, we're going up in space 
someday,'' their father recalls. 
</P>
<P>
	``She would just laugh at them,'' he says. ``Now she's very  
upset.'' Although she's 84, she plans to be at the launch. 
</P>
<P>
	The twins' mother, Patricia, says she isn't surprised that her  
sons have lived similar lives. ``I really do believe there is a 
genetic disposition for certain things,'' says Mrs. Kelly, a 
retired police officer like her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep the twins on equal footing, their parents refused to  
tell them which one was older until they were 16. Mark is older by 
six minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	They attended different colleges, yet ended up in the same class  
at the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School in 1993. The school didn't know 
they were twins until they showed up; officials suggested one of 
them shave his mustache so instructors could tell them apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott made the sacrifice.  
</P>
<P>
	The Kellys stayed on at the Naval Air Station Patuxent River in  
Maryland, albeit in different assignments. Their work often put 
them on opposite sides of the world; Mark, for instance, was sent 
to the Persian Gulf during Operation Desert Storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when thousands of miles apart, when one twin called his  
parents, the other would often call within two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	It was at Pax River, in April 1996, that the brothers got The  
Call. NASA wanted them. Both of them. And neither had to shave his 
mustache. They moved to Houston a few months later, to the same 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are, in fact, differences between the two. Scott is  
more laid back, Mark more on the go. Scott has one daughter, Mark 
has two. Scott's wife, Leslie, is a full-time homemaker. Mark's 
wife, Amy, works for a construction company. 
</P>
<P>
	The word ``astrotwins'' makes them wince.  
</P>
<P>
	``Excuse me? That's like a curse word,'' says Scott.  
</P>
<P>
	``Please don't use that in print,'' Mark pleads.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ex-Colonel Faces Third Murder Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- George Marecek's eventful life has  
earned him several vivid appellations: 
</P>
<P>
	Child survivor of a Nazi concentration camp.  
</P>
<P>
	Green Beret colonel.  
</P>
<P>
	Decorated combat veteran in Korea and Vietnam.  
</P>
<P>
	Wife killer.  
</P>
<P>
	The 66-year-old Special Forces retiree has battled the last tag  
for five years, and the fight may not be finished. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been tried twice and convicted once for the 1991 murder  
of his second wife, Viparat Saewong Marecek. The first proceeding 
ended in mistrial in 1995 when one juror held out for acquittal; 
the second jury's conviction was overturned by the state Court of 
Appeals in July 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you would be safe in assuming it will be retried, but  
I can't say when,'' says prosecutor Dean Bowman. Until the state 
decides whether to pursue a third trial, Marecek must check in 
daily with a court officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't need this,'' Marecek said recently as he sat in his  
attorney's office. ``This is going on the eighth year now, and I'm 
drenched. I'm exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if you can imagine the financial and physical  
stress, not only of losing my wife, but then being hammered with 
something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors see him as anything but a victim. Even two of  
Marecek's three children have testified against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they have another trial, I'll have to testify again, and  
I'll just tell the truth ... I have to,'' says Susan Kirk, 41, 
Marecek's daughter. ``Viparat was part of my family. We were 
friends, and she trusted me. I couldn't possibly not stand up for 
her when she can't stand up for her herself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy Hicks, who prosecuted both trials, said Marecek killed his  
wife so he could collect on a life insurance policy and marry his 
Czech cousin, Hana, whom he'd met the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	``We managed to convince 23 out of 24 jurors he was guilty,''  
Hicks says. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kirk testified that her stepmother suspected Marecek was  
having an affair with Hana, whom he had visited at least twice, and 
grew concerned when he took out a new $150,000 life insurance 
policy on her in the spring of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Marecek testified that he and his father got drunk one  
day and his father confessed to making ``a big mistake,'' which 
Michael took to mean he'd killed Viparat. 
</P>
<P>
	Marecek's younger daughter, Eva Lynn, testified on his behalf.  
Despite their differences, all three siblings stay in touch. But 
Mrs. Kirk has not spoken with her father since the first day of his 
first trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``He couldn't believe I would think such a thing,'' Mrs. Kirk  
says. ``But his story of events and the preceding events didn't 
correspond with the things that I knew, the things that Viparat had 
told me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1991, George and Viparat -- his wife of nine years, whom  
he'd met in Thailand in the mid-1970s -- were vacationing at a beach 
cottage near the Cape Fear River. Marecek told investigators he 
went to the beach about mid-afternoon on June 3. His wife planned 
to go out later to check some fishing spots. They agreed he would 
start the chicken for dinner if she wasn't home when he got back. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to the cottage about 5:30 but didn't become alarmed  
at her absence until the rain started. About 8:30, he called 
police, who searched that night. 
</P>
<P>
	Marecek says he resumed the search the next day and found his  
42-year-old wife face-down and nude in the river. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical examiner said she'd drowned but that she'd also been  
struck several times with a blunt object and the blows could have 
incapacitated her before she entered the river. Investigators never 
determined where she was beaten or what happened to her clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things that struck me from the beginning was that  
when her body was found, there was nothing -- no clothes, no 
jewelry, no nothing,'' Hicks says. ``Somebody who had just 
committed a killing would not have taken that care to clean up the 
scene without planning it ahead of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case against Marecek was totally circumstantial. Deputies  
found no murder weapon, and there were no witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Two and a half years passed until Marecek was indicted, charged  
and put on trial. He served 18 months of a 30-year prison sentence 
before the appeals court overturned the conviction, ruling the 
judge had improperly allowed hearsay testimony, including that of 
Mrs. Kirk. 
</P>
<P>
	Marecek says he first tasted captivity as a 12-year-old boy. In  
1944, after his father, an underground activist who helped rescue 
downed Allied pilots, went into hiding, the Nazis sent him and his 
mother to a concentration camp at Terezin, Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
	Marecek is reluctant to discuss either prison experience. He is  
more comfortable talking about his military career. He stills wears 
his hair in a crew cut and lapses into military jargon to spell the 
name of his hometown, Dolni Poustevna -- ``.... Echo, Victor, 
November, Alpha.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Combat awards include the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Silver  
Star, the Bronze Star and three Purple Hearts. He earned the 
Distinguished Service Cross, the Army's second-highest combat 
medal, for actions during a nightime enemy attack in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	``I rallied the troops ... and I knocked out a few automatic  
weapons,'' he says matter-of-factly. 
</P>
<P>
	Marecek believes prosecutors used his combat training and 24  
years with the Special Forces to depict him as a man capable of 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always felt that my military record has been used very  
effectively against me,'' Marecek says. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorney, Gerald Beaver, agrees: ``They tried to turn that  
against him, as if that makes him a cunning, ruthless killer.''

<HEADLINE> Heston Says Gun Laws Not Answer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- National Rifle Association President Charlton  
Heston said Sunday that better pursuit of criminals, not new gun 
laws, is the best way to prevent a repeat of the Colorado high 
school shootings. An administration proposal to impose new 
background checks on gun purchasers, he said, ``smells of 
tyranny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heston, in his first national interview since the shootings at  
Columbine High School, told ABC's ``This Week'' that he would also 
oppose President Clinton's attempt to limit handgun purchases to 
one a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before you know it, it becomes no guns,'' he said, emphasizing  
the NRA argument that gun control advocates are trying to build up 
momentum for more comprehensive restrictions on gun ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA has been on the defensive since two teenagers killed 12  
students and a teacher at the Denver area high school before 
committing suicide. Some 8,000 people demonstrated outside an NRA 
annual convention in Denver Saturday to decry the NRA's hard-line 
positions on gun ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	But Heston insisted that ``the problem is not the availability  
of guns,'' but the failure of the Justice Department to enforce 
what he said are more than 2,000 laws controlling the sale and 
ownership of firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not interested in denying them purchase,'' the former  
actor said of convicted felons, who would be targeted by Clinton's 
proposal to extend waiting periods included in the Brady Law. ``I'm 
interested in seeing them imprisoned. There are plenty of laws to 
do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in the most far-ranging gun-control package since the  
Brady Law passed five years ago, is seeking to raise the legal age 
for handgun possession from 18 to 21, hold negligent parents 
liable, halt imports of all high-capacity ammunition clips and 
limit handgun purchases to one a month. 
</P>
<P>
	He would also mandate child-safety locks on all guns sold,  
impose background checks on buyers for all gun-show sales, and 
require a three-day waiting period for all handgun purchases. Today 
most checks to verify that a would-be purchaser doesn't have a 
criminal record are done instantaneously. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can anyone say that those requirements are not  
reasonable?'' said Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder, also on 
ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder rejected the NRA's ``slippery slope'' argument, saying  
that in five years the Brady Law, which requires background checks, 
has prevented 250,000 people with criminal records from getting 
guns while people's legitimate rights to buy guns have not ``been 
restricted in any kind of major way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton package faces an uphill fight in Congress, where the  
Republican majority has long been suspicious of gun control, and 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., echoed Heston in saying 
the answer to youth violence lies in better enforcement rather than 
more laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think when you commit a crime with a gun, we ought to throw  
the book at them, and we ought to enforce those laws, and the 
Justice Department has not been doing that,'' he said on CNN's 
``Late Edition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, on ``Fox News  
Sunday,'' said that since Clinton took office, gun violation 
prosecutions have been cut in half. ``This administration hasn't 
been very serious about guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a leading advocate of gun control,  
praised the Clinton package but acknowledged that even passing 
modest new laws will be tough. One survey found that only 4 percent 
of Americans think new gun control laws aren't needed, he said, and 
``I think that 4 percent is all in the Congress.'

<HEADLINE> N.Y. To Allow E-Mail Prescriptions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Xjkdfvdsgasdfadstfhfbdfg.  
</P>
<P>
	That's what most people -- and some pharmacists -- see on their  
prescription after a doctor scribbles the name of a type of pill on 
a pad. 
</P>
<P>
	But starting in June, a doctor's bad handwriting won't matter  
because New York state will allow e-mail and fax communication 
between a physician and a pharmacist. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, New York bans doctors from faxing or e-mailing their  
patients' prescriptions to a pharmacy, although 40 states allow 
prescriptions to be faxes and 30 allow them to be e-mailed. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new regulations, however, controlled substances will  
not be able to be prescribed electronically. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining the computer and fax age will virtually eliminate the  
possibility of a pharmacist giving someone the wrong medicine 
because of a misunderstanding caused by the doctor's handwriting or 
a mispronunciation over the phone, Regents Chancellor Carl Hayden 
said April 27. 
</P>
<P>
	``The move to that form could eliminate 40 percent of  
prescription errors,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Within three years, half of the prescriptions will be handled  
electronically,'' Hayden predicted. At least 165 million 
prescriptions are written each year in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of doctors and pharmacists' organizations said  
they don't have any problem with the new regulations, which will 
take effect June 18. 
</P>
<P>
	An e-mail or a fax ``certainly would be easier to decipher than  
it is to decipher someone's handwriting,'' said Craig Burridge, 
executive director of the Pharmacists Society of the State of New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Information will be encrypted to prevent unauthorized access to  
patient information, officials said. Unauthorized access by a 
pharmacist could result in the loss of a license and possible 
criminal prosecution, according to Hayden and state Education 
Commissioner Robert Mills. 
</P>
<P>
	The Board of Regents, which supervises public and private  
education in New York state, also licenses pharmacists, among other 
professionals. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors and pharmacists going online shouldn't increase the  
costs of their services, officials said. ``Pharmacies are 98 
percent electronic anyway,'' Burridge said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new regulations also require pharmacists to personally offer  
counseling about medication when prescriptions are filled or 
refilled instead of allowing unlicensed personnel like cashiers to 
do it. 
</P>
<P>
	Requiring pharmacists to talk to people about their medication  
will decrease the chance that people will take medicines that react 
badly to each other, Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules also allow patients to authorize the electronic  
sharing of their personal medical profile between pharmacies. That 
will allow patients to get their prescriptions filled or refilled 
at any pharmacy in the state or potentially the nation, officials 
said.

<HEADLINE> Elder Runner Sets World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- A 96-year-old man shattered an age-group world  
record Saturday when he ran the 100-meter dash in 24.01 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Erwin Jaskulski of Honolulu broke the 95-and-older age-group  
record of 38.82 seconds set by Kazuhiko Tsutsumi of Japan in 1997, 
said officials at the Punahou Relays. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaskulski broke the world record twice last year, but his  
efforts weren't recognized by the World Association of Veteran 
Athletes because of technical questions about wind and the lack of 
electronic timing equipment, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	All requirements were met for Saturday's race, said meet referee  
Gordon Scruton Sr. 
</P>
<P>
	``This record has to be accepted by WAVA,'' said Jack Karbens,  
president of the Hawaii Masters Track Club. ``Everything was in 
place to meet all the requirements, including adequate officials, 
electronic timing and wind gauges. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our hope that Erwin Jaskulski can finally take his  
recognized place as the world's fastest human in his age group,'' 
Karbens said.

<HEADLINE> Marlins' Fernandez Goes Back on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Florida Marlins pitcher Alex Fernandez is going  
back on the disabled list, this time with a pulled groin muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	In his fourth start of the year -- his second since returning  
from the DL -- Fernandez left in the second inning with a pulled 
right groin and will go on the disabled list Monday. He winced in 
pain after throwing a pitch to Tony Eusebio, coming off the mound 
awkwardly. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest, I'm happy it's not his shoulder,'' Florida  
manager John Boles said. ``When I went out to the mound I thought 
'Oh gosh, this is his career.' But it was his groin ... so right 
away it wasn't an uplifting experience, but it was better than it 
could have been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez, who missed the entire 1998 season following surgery  
to repair a torn rotator cuff, will be examined Monday by Dr. Dan 
Kanell to determine the severity of the latest injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of the game,'' Fernandez said as he leaned on  
crutches. ``What I've gone through and endured over the last 18 
months is a lot more than a groin pull.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez's first trip to the DL this year was caused by  
inflammation in the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't see the life on his fastball,'' said Houston's Bill  
Spiers. ``I know him from the American League and I know how he 
used to throw, but he's coming back from a serious injury. It's a 
long road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez, who threw four shutout innings last Tuesday against  
the Cubs, said his shoulder felt strong Sunday. He also said the 
time off rehabilitating the groin might help the shoulder too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess you have to try and find the positive,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Florida will put Fernandez on the 15-day disabled list Monday  
and bring up reliever Rafael Medina from Triple-A Calgary.

<HEADLINE> Iverson the 'Answer' To 76ers Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Allen Iverson and Larry Brown had their  
moments this season. At times, it seemed as though the kid with the 
cornrows and the traditional, bespectacled coach would never work 
out their differences. 
</P>
<P>
	They finally did, just in time to send the Philadelphia 76ers to  
the playoffs for the first time in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	For a franchise like the Sixers, this is cause for a major  
celebration. And the Sixers had one on Saturday night -- a full 
house, a stellar performance by Iverson and signs of another 
successful turnaround orchestrated by Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've got the best player in the league, and I think  
we've got the best coach,'' said team president Pat Croce, who put 
on a playoff T-shirt and became a human handshake machine after the 
Sixers clinched their first playoff berth since the 1991 with a 
103-96 victory over Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Croce is given to hyperbole, there is no denying the  
extent of this basketball revival. The Sixers have seen some of the 
grimmest moments in NBA history, including the 9-73 record in 
1972-73 that is the league's worst ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia has been through a lot of lean basketball seasons  
since Charles Barkley, Andrew Toney and Rick Mahorn led the Sixers 
to the playoffs eights ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Back then, they didn't have a direction,'' said Mahorn, who  
left the Sixers after their last playoff season and returned this 
year. ``Now they have a direction of not only making the playoffs, 
but making sure we can get in there and do some damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sixers won only 18 games three years ago, the year before  
they picked Iverson No. 1 in the draft. Last year, they hired Brown 
to rescue them from laughability. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pat gave me an opportunity that I wasn't real excited about,  
to be honest with you,'' said Brown, who twice led the Indiana 
Pacers to the Eastern Conference finals before taking the Sixers 
job in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't excited about coaching this team,'' Brown said. ``So  
maybe from where we were to where we are now, it feels as good as 
any situation I've ever been in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But when Brown started having problems with Iverson, the  
franchise player, it seemed as though one of them would have to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson and Brown frequently criticized each other in their  
first season together last year. Brown griped about Iverson's 
missed practices, ill-advised shots and less-than-stellar defense. 
Iverson railed that his coach wouldn't give him enough freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	Late in the year, Brown moved Iverson to shooting guard. He  
still took too many shots, but offered a preview of the kind of 
havoc he can wreak when free to sprint all over the floor and look 
for shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows I'm the scorer on this team,'' Iverson said.  
</P>
<P>
	But just when they seemed to be getting along, Iverson and Brown  
had another meltdown. Iverson cursed Brown as the coach tried to 
put him back into a game against Cleveland on April 2, and Brown 
sent him back to the bench. Iverson didn't make a road trip to 
Toronto, and it seemed as though the two would have to part ways. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday night, Iverson scored 31 points and didn't mind one  
bit when Brown took him out for a curtain call with 19 seconds 
left. Iverson pointed to the crowd and applauded them, then thanked 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been great,'' Iverson said. ``He's the reason all of us  
have put it together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson is in a tight race with Shaquille O'Neal for the scoring  
title, and he is starting to get recognition from the likes of Wilt 
Chamberlain and Julius Erving in his bid for an MVP trophy. For the 
second time in a week, Iverson heard ``MVP! MVP!'' chanted for him 
at the First Union Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Brown is touting him for it now.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think Allen's made great progress,'' Brown said. ``He's been  
here three years and he didn't make the All-Star team. I mean, he 
didn't even get a sniff. Now the crowd is responding to something, 
and it's a possibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Sixers could get back to the playoffs, anything is

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Attends Press Dinner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a year in which he was impeached and his  
life's most intimate moments were exposed to the public, a night 
out with the White House press corps wouldn't seem to be President 
Clinton's ideal evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday evening, though, Clinton put aside any lingering  
bitterness and cracked a few jokes at the annual White House 
Correspondents Association dinner at a Washington hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton showed up late enough to miss the presentation of an  
award to Newsweek's Michael Isikoff, a reporter who dedicated the 
past year to unearthing the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Instead, the 
president came in time to hear the jokes of MSNBC anchor Brian 
Williams, master of ceremonies for the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams poked fun at Washington's media elite, telling the  
audience that The Washington Post was late to the event because it 
has been ``going out to dinner on the same story since 1974,'' a 
reference to its breaking much of the Watergate scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams also took shots at political leaders, frequently  
mocking Vice President Al Gore for his claim that he invented the 
Internet. Clinton took the podium and responded, saying that Gore, 
who attended the Kentucky Derby on Saturday, never claimed he sired 
the winning horse. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton then poked fun at the press, telling the crowd that  
veteran reporter Helen Thomas of United Press International was 
upset at a proposed move in the White House briefing room because 
she remembered the last time it moved -- when the capital changed 
from Philadelphia to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, who later spoke seriously about the situation in  
Kosovo, joked with the assembled media about war coverage. He asked 
them to imagine the effects the 24-hour media would have had on 
other wars. The sub-headline on a story about President Lincoln's 
Gettysburg Address? President ``does not offer exit strategy.'' How 
about Gen. Douglas MacArthur's promise to return to the 
Philippines? MacArthur ``does not set clear timetable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the president and the dinner audience were entertained by  
singer Aretha Franklin.

past year to unearthing the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Instead, the 
president came in time to hear the jokes of MSNBC anchor Brian 
Williams, master of ceremonies for the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams poked fun at Washington's media elite, telling the  
audience that The Washington Post was late to the event because it 
has been ``going out to dinner on the same story since 1974,'' a 
reference to its breaking much of the Watergate scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams also took shots at political leaders, frequently  
mocking Vice President Al Gore for his claim that he invented the 
Internet. Clinton took the podium and responded, saying that Gore, 
who attended the Kentucky Derby on Saturday, never claimed he sired 
the winning horse. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton then poked fun at the press, telling the crowd that  
veteran reporter Helen Thomas of United Press International was 
upset at a proposed move in the White House briefing room because 
she remembered the last time it moved -- when the capital changed 
from Philadelphia to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, who later spoke seriously about the situation in  
Kosovo, joked with the assembled media about war coverage. He asked 
them to imagine the effects the 24-hour media would have had on 
other wars. The sub-headline on a story about President Lincoln's 
Gettysburg Address? President ``does not offer exit strategy.'' How 
about Gen. Douglas MacArthur's promise to return to the 
Philippines? MacArthur ``does not set clear timetable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the president and the dinner audience were entertained by  
singer Aretha Franklin.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Summon Pride for Cuba Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles will wear black, orange  
and white Monday night for their rematch against Cuba. They'll be 
thinking red, white and blue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The important thing of every game is to win no matter what  
kind of uniform you wear or who you represent,'' Orioles pitcher 
Ricky Bones said Sunday. ``This time we're going to represent the 
United States. We should go out there with pride and try to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles have struggled mightily since beating Cuba 3-2 in 11  
innings on March 28 in Havana. The team is in last place, the 
players are being booed at Camden Yards and manager Ray Miller 
might not have his job by the end of the 12-game homestand 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	So the Orioles can be forgiven if they don't regard the game  
with great anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, you'd like the club to have a day off,'' Miller  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's much the same attitude the Orioles carried into the first  
exhibition. But shortly after the playing of both country's 
national anthems, their attitude changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot more comes into it than just you or your team. Even  
though we weren't really representing the U.S., we were in a way,'' 
outfielder B.J. Surhoff said. ``We were one team but we were 
representing a whole lot of people. They looked at it as their 
national team representing them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Down there I knew it would be really intense and they'd be  
into it. I'm kind of curious to see how it's all going to play out 
tomorrow night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the days leading to the first game, the Orioles had to  
scramble to get their birth certificates, passports and visas in 
order. 
</P>
<P>
	This time it's the Cubans who have been tangled in red tape -- a  
visa problem that delayed their flight out of Havana and forced the 
cancellation of Sunday's workout at Camden Yards and a reception in 
their honor. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first game, many of Cuba's best players were unavailable  
because they were involved in the country's playoffs. There was no 
such obstacle this time, so the Orioles can expect even more 
competition in the rematch. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll have a better team this time. They'll have better  
players to choose from,'' said catcher Charles Johnson, whose 
two-run homer provided the majority of Baltimore's offense in the 
first game. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller hoped to rest his starters after six innings of that  
game, but the close score and high intensity caused him to stick 
with most of his stars the entire way. He will use his regular 
lineup Monday with the exception of his starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Kamieniecki, who is on the disabled list, will start for  
Baltimore. The Orioles can only hope the Cubans don't counter with 
Jose Contreras, who allowed two hits over eight shutout innings and 
struck out 10 in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
	While many of the Orioles consider the game a distraction, they  
realize the prestige associated with representing their country. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Twins manager Tom Kelly, whose team faced the Orioles  
on Sunday, wished he could be a part of the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd take it as an honor to manage and represent major league  
baseball in that endeavor,'' he said. ``I think I would really 
enjoy it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles merely want to make the best of the situation.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of pride taken over in Cuba. We did everything  
we could to win that game and I'm sure it will be no different over 
here,'' backup catcher Lenny Webster said. ``We hope to enjoy it, 
but at the same time we're going to try and beat them.''

<HEADLINE>  Grissom's Mercury Capsule Located </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Lost at sea for 38 years, astronaut  
Gus Grissom's Mercury capsule was found over the weekend by an 
underwater salvage team that had been searching for the spacecraft 
300 miles offshore. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty Bell 7 is still 3 miles deep in the Atlantic.  
</P>
<P>
	The cable to a remotely operated rover used to identify and  
photograph the capsule snapped Saturday night because of the rough 
sea, and the rover sank. The salvagers are returning to Port 
Canaveral for new equipment and will have to wait several weeks 
before going back to recover the spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	But at least they know now where it is and they're thrilled  
about Saturday's discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks to be in beautiful condition and certainly capable of  
being recovered,'' expedition leader Curt Newport said Sunday by 
phone from the ship, the Needham Tide. 
</P>
<P>
	The only U.S. spacecraft ever lost following a successful  
mission, the capsule is still shiny in spots with an intact window 
and the name ``Liberty Bell 7'' clearly printed beneath it. Even 
the fake crack that was painted on the exterior to replicate the 
real Liberty Bell is still visible, as are the singe marks left by 
the explosives that blew out the hatch following splashdown on July 
21, 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty Bell 7 sank following Grissom's successful 15-minute  
suborbital flight -- the nation's second manned space shot. The 
explosive bolts for blowing open the hatch detonated prematurely, 
and helicopter rescuers were unable to lift the waterlogged 
spacecraft from the sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Grissom nearly drowned, but was pulled to safety. He insisted  
until his death in the Apollo launch pad fire in 1967 that he'd 
done nothing wrong, although some questioned at the time -- and 
still do -- whether he bumped something or even panicked. 
</P>
<P>
	Grissom's widow, Betty, who feels certain the hatch  
malfunctioned, said last month that she hoped her husband's capsule 
would remain buried in the Atlantic. She resents not being 
consulted from the start about the salvage effort and does not want 
the spacecraft to be restored by the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space 
Center, as is the plan. That's where the capsule eventually will be 
put on display under an agreement with NASA and the Smithsonian 
Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport's success didn't come easy.  
</P>
<P>
	He and his team ran into trouble after setting sail April 19 on  
a voyage financed by the Discovery Channel. The sonar promptly 
broke down. Once fixed, it uncovered 88 potential targets in the 
24-square-mile area that Newport pinpointed based on 14 years of 
studying NASA charts and interviewing those who were there when 
Liberty Bell 7 went down. 
</P>
<P>
	The first target they looked at with the camera-equipped rover  
ended up being the 7-foot titanium and aluminum capsule. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport said the team followed decomposed pieces of the  
capsule's heat shield up a hill. The trail of debris led to the 
capsule, propped upright. It emerged out of the gloom as a tall, 
conical, dark object; Newport thought at first it was airplane 
wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember saying, 'Oh, my God, I can't believe it. That's it.  
We found it. This is it,' '' he said. ``There was a lot of shaking 
hands and slapping each other on the back and just congratulating 
each other and just staring in disbelief at this spacecraft in 
front of us, us being the first ones to see it since 1961.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newport, 47, had made two previous attempts to find the capsule.  
The former space station worker did not have sophisticated enough 
equipment or enough time during his tries in 1992 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was really a difficult thing to find,'' he noted. ``You  
have to understand, what we did was find something in water half a 
mile deeper than the Titanic and it's smaller than one of the 
Titanic's boilers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two cameras and a tape recorder that sank with the capsule could  
shed light on why the hatch blew open too soon -- one of the biggest 
mysteries of American space flight. It's doubtful, however, the 
film could be salvaged after so long underwater. 
</P>
<P>
	The hatch almost certainly would hold the answer. Newport  
estimates the hatch could be as much as a mile from Liberty Bell 7; 
he plans to spend a day looking for it when he returns for the 
capsule. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Newport and his team can recover the spacecraft and rover  
and search for the hatch, they must obtain another submersible like 
the one that sank Saturday. That will take at least a few weeks and 
possibly longer, said Mike Quattrone, senior vice president for the 
Discovery Channel, which is filming the expedition for a 
documentary to be broadcast this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are absolutely ecstatic,'' Quattrone said. ``When he gets  
back, I want to find out what kind of lucky charm he's carrying. To 
do this on the first dive is absolutely unheard of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the record, Newport's lucky charm is a stuffed lamb, one of  
his dog's favorite toys. It's on the ocean floor attached to the 
rover that sank, so Newport will have to wait a while before he 
gets it back.

<HEADLINE> Jockey Hurt After Setting Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just one race after guiding Artax to a track  
record, jockey Jorge Chavez was involved in a nasty spill at 
Aqueduct on Sunday, but was not seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
	In the eighth race, the $200,000 Grade I Carter Handicap, Artax  
and Chavez set a track record, covering seven furlongs in 1:20:04. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ninth and final race, a seven-furlong allowance, Coby  
Appeal, who raced wide from the start, fell, tossing Chavez to the 
track. 
</P>
<P>
	Remsenberg, ridden by Shaun Bridgmohan, instinctively leaped  
over the fallen Coby Appeal causing the jockey to lose his balance 
and fall. Both Coby Appeal and Remsenberg appeared to have escaped 
serious injury as they ran riderless from the site of the mishap. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, 37, was taken from the track on a stretcher and then by  
ambulance to North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	He was examined, evaluated and released, a community relations  
spokeswoman for the hospital said Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a jockey's room attendant, Chavez was complaining  
of shoulder soreness when he was taken to the ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Depass, Chavez's agent, said the rider bit his tongue  
and lost his helmet during the spill. 
</P>
<P>
	Bridgmohan got up immediately and, though shaken up, spoke only  
of experiencing some stiffness. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, a native of Peru, was the leading rider in New York from  
1994 through 1997. In 1997 he finished 10th in the nation in 
earnings with more than $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The track record Artax broke was set by Dr. Fager on Nov. 2,  
1968 in the Vosburgh Handicap. Dr. Fager was clocked in 1:20:20 but 
he carried 139 pounds, 25 more than Artax did. 
</P>
<P>
	Affirmed Success finished 3 1/4 lengths behind Artax and 2 1/2 lengths  
in front of Western Borders in the field of nine. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time in the last three years Chavez rode the  
winner of the Carter as he guided Langfuhr to the winner's circle 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the first in six starts this year for Artax, a  
4-year-old colt by Marquetry from the Apalachee mare, Raging 
Apalachee. 
</P>
<P>
	Artax returned $12.20, $5.40 and $4.40. Affirmed Success paid  
$3.50 and $2.80, while Western Borders was $8.60 to show.

	RAMSTEIN, Germany (AP) -- After being held as prisoners of war in  
Yugoslavia for more than a month, three U.S. soldiers marched into 
freedom today. The jubilant servicemen arrived at a U.S. military 
base in southwest Germany, capping an emotional day-long journey by 
land and air from Yugoslavia's capital with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, 
who orchestrated their release in Belgrade. But there were no signs 
that the soldiers' release would bring an end to the NATO bombing

Panama when the United States cedes control of the Panama Canal at 
the end of the year. She defeated Martin Torrijos, the son of 
military strongman Gen. Omar Torrijos, who had helped depose 
Moscoso's late husband from the presidency and went on to sign the 
1977 Canal Treaties with the United States. Moscoso's supporters

that the decision that's going to impress us most is the decision 
to order troops out of Kosovo,'' and ``clearly and unambiguously'' 
accept an armed international force, said Jamie Shea, NATO's chief 
spokesman. The alliance launched the air campaign to force 
Milosevic to accept a peace deal for Kosovo, including widespread

amphitheater. The crowd was spared the rains that have deluged the 
area since shortly after the April 20 massacre of 12 students and

	Hellebuyck, 38, a native of Belgium and 1996 Olympian who got  
his U.S. citizenship three weeks ago, finished in 2:16:58. Swift, 
28, beat his best-ever time by four minutes and finished the 
26.2-mile course in 2:17:26. 
</P>
<P>
	Vigueras, a substitute teacher who trained in Mexico, running  
his first marathon this year, won his first marathon by breaking 
away from the field at the 14th mile and catching Scott Larson at 
the 18th mile. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished 53 seconds behind his best marathon time, recorded  
in 1996 at Los Angeles. He said he had experienced lower back pain 
during the last three weeks and stomach and right leg pains during 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before the race, I was scared. But after a few miles, I forgot  
the pain and I concentrated on my job,'' Vigueras said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the race, Vigueras thought that Larson, who had pulled  
away from the field early and was running at 4:50 per mile with 
hired pacesetter Peter DeLaCerta, would falter. Larson eventually 
dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he took off, we knew he would either run the race or  
start dying. ... That was not a smart decision. You have to run a 
smart race to win this marathon,'' Vigueras said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had been training with men 10 to 15 years younger in  
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``They gave me new energy,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hellebuyck, who runs a training complex with about three dozen  
runners in Albuquerque, said he realized midway through the race 
that Vigueras was too strong to catch. 
</P>
<P>
	He aimed for either second or third -- ahead of the faltering  
Larson and exploited the downhill on the last course's four miles 
into Point State Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``I turned to Steve and I said, `Let's go get him. We'll both  
make the team,' '' Hellebuyck said. ``I'm a heat runner. I proved 
today that I can run in sunny conditions, and Spain will be even 
hotter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swift said he has been trying to break 2:20 in the marathon for  
two years but did not expect to finish in the top three and make 
the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I put pressure on myself and told myself, `It's got to happen  
soon, or maybe it won't happen at all,' '' he said about the 2:20 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Titova, 33, who will next race in San Francisco's marathon, said  
she was buoyed by live bands along the course and estimated that 
she lost five minutes off her time because of temperatures in the 
mid-60s and a lack of cloud cover. 
</P>
<P>
	She said through an interpreter that she ran through spasms in  
her leg muscles during the last three miles.

<HEADLINE> Wohlers Wild in Minor League Outing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- Mark Wohlers went back to the mound Sunday  
and his control problems came right back. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers had trouble throwing strikes in his debut with the  
Cincinnati Reds' Triple-A team. He walked five of the seven batters 
he faced and threw four wild pitches in one-third of an inning as 
Indianapolis lost to Toledo 8-5 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Wohlers' first appearance in a game since the Reds got  
him from Atlanta on April 16 for reliever John Hudek. Pitching 
coach Don Gullett has changed a few things in Wohlers' delivery to 
help him regain his control. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers, who is on the disabled list with anxiety disorder, came  
in to start the sixth inning with Toledo leading 3-2. He threw 31 
pitches in all, 22 of them balls. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers got one strikeout, walked five, gave up one hit, struck  
out one and threw four wild pitches. Afterwards, he declined to be 
interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	After Hamelin walked to start the inning, Wohlers threw two wild  
pitches with Luis Polonia at bat. Polonia hit an RBI single and 
eventually scored on another wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Cradle and Jim Bonnici walked before Wohlers got a called  
third strike on Walt McKeel. Walks to Jason Maxwell and Kimera 
Bartee forced in another run and ended Wohlers' outing. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers, 29, set an Atlanta Braves record with 39 saves in 1996,  
and had 33 the following season. But last year, he was sent to 
Triple-A Richmond twice when his control deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the season -- after he pulled a muscle in his side,  
his wife filed for divorce and his mother suffered a heart attack -- 
his confidence was shot.

<HEADLINE> Author Criticized for Superstore Ad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Unhappy with an author they once honored,  
independent booksellers overwhelmingly approved a resolution 
criticizing Frank McCourt for appearing in a television ad for the 
on-line superstore barnesandnoble.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Booksellers Association, with a core membership of  
some 3,300 independent stores, voted Saturday at BookExpo America 
to draft a letter to McCourt expressing disappointment. He is the 
author of the hugely popular ``Angela's Ashes'' and the upcoming 
sequel ``Tis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never asked for an apology in my life and I've never  
given one. What I do I do. ... If I get a letter from them it'll go 
back unopened,'' said McCourt, a featured speaker at BEA. 
</P>
<P>
	The expo, a three-day exhibition and trade show that ended  
Sunday, is the publishing industry's annual national convention. It 
was held at the Los Angeles Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABA's letter will be sent to a beloved writer, and not just  
with readers. Two years ago, the association presented McCourt its 
annual ABBY award, given to the author whose book they most enjoyed 
selling. His memoir was a surprise success and he has given a lot 
of the credit to independents. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they (independent stores) had wanted me to do a commercial  
I would have done one for them, too. I'm not a politician. I just 
did what my publisher requested,'' McCourt said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution is actually far lighter than the original  
proposed by independent seller Andy Ross, owner of Cody's Books 
Inc. in Berkeley. Ross, condemning the ``hypocrisy of writers and 
intellectuals,'' had wanted the ABA to call for McCourt to give 
back his ABBY award. 
</P>
<P>
	The booksellers overwhelmingly rejected that idea as too harsh.  
</P>
<P>
	``I really offered this resolution in a spirit to generate  
discussion,'' Ross said. ``They (writers) talk about independent 
booksellers at cocktail parties, but they're afraid to speak up. 
The chains have become so powerful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other writers appearing in ads for barnesandnoble.com include  
Tom Clancy and Stephen King, another vocal supporter of 
independents. 
</P>
<P>
	``In retrospect, I understand how they feel, but I never really  
anticipated it,'' said Susan Moldow, vice president and publisher 
of Scribner, an imprint of Simon &AMP; Schuster that publishes both 
McCourt and King. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he'd do another superstore ad, McCourt said ``I'd be  
very careful the next time. From now on, I probably won't do 
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ABA action highlighted a weekend of tough talk. The  
association aggressively promoted its answer to Amazon.com and 
other on-line sellers, BookSense.com, to be open for business late 
summer. And individual members accused Barnes &AMP; Noble, Amazon.com 
and other ``bad corporate citizens'' of everything from false 
advertising to stealing customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are fighting for our lives,'' said ABA president Richard  
Howorth. 
</P>
<P>
	Booksellers received both bad news and good news at BEA. A new  
consumer survey said that adults in the U.S. bought 30 million 
fewer books in 1998 than the year before. The apparent culprit was 
an odd one: A good economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``In good times, consumers seem to spend their money on other  
kinds of entertainment or on more expensive durable goods. In 
tighter economic times, consumers once again think about books,'' 
said Sandra Paul, managing agent of the Book Industry Study Group, 
which conducted the survey. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ABA, which has lost nearly 2,000 stores over the past  
decade, also reported a long-hoped for statistic. In March of this 
year, the number of stores increased slightly, the first monthly 
improvement in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been going against us for a long time, but it's going to  
go the other way,'' said Avin Mark Domnitz, the ABA's chief 
executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, there was still plenty of time to talk about books.  
Major upcoming releases include McCourt's new book; ``Dutch,'' 
Edmund Morris' long-awaited memoir about former President Ronald 
Reagan; Sue Grafton's latest lettered mystery, ``O is For Outlaw,'' 
and ``Hannibal,'' Thomas Harris' sequel to ``The Silence of the 
Lambs.''

<HEADLINE> US Marine Jet Crashes in Adriatic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO said Sunday a U.S. Marine Corps  
AV8B Harrier plane crashed in the Adriatic Sea on Saturday while on 
a training mission for operations in the Balkans. The pilot was 
reported safely rescued. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second report of a crashed U.S. warplane in 24 hours  
operating over and around Yugoslavia. Neither pilot's name was 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours earlier, the alliance said a U.S. F-16 fighter plane had  
gone down over western Serbia early Sunday. NATO said the crash was 
caused by engine failure, but Yugoslav authorities claimed the jet 
was shot down. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Aviano air base in Italy, Air Force Capt. Ed  
Thomas, said Sunday the F-16 pilot returned to Aviano ``in really 
good condition and really good spirits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot, an American, is expected to quickly return to action.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know the guy. He's a really, really good officer,'' Thomas  
said. ``I'd be surprised at anything less. We're so grateful that 
he's back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And out of 12,000 sorties,'' Thomas said, ``we haven't lost a  
single pilot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas declined to give details of the rescue operation other  
than to say that both ``fixed wing'' aircraft and helicopters were 
involved. Some of the aircraft were ``probably'' out of Aviano, 
although the base is not the primary one for special operations. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said the AV8B Harrier plane crashed  
into the sea while approaching a carrier of the Marine 
Expeditionary Force to land. 
</P>
<P>
	Shea said the plane was not involved in attacks on Yugoslavia  
when it came down and there was no suspicion it has hit by hostile 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The Harrier was assigned to the Marine Attack Squadron 231 from  
Cherry Point, N.C. It is part of the Marine Expeditionary Unit 
deployed in support of the NATO operation in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has now acknowledged the loss of two other aircraft since  
the air campaign against Yugoslavia began on March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. F-117 stealth fighter went down over Yugoslavia on March  
27. The pilot of that plane was also rescued. An Apache helicopter 
gunship crashed in flames last week on a training mission in 
Albania. Its crewmen escaped with cuts and bruises.

<HEADLINE> Five Texas Cities Choose Mayors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- In the lightest turnout for a mayoral election in  
30 years, voters gave the city's first black mayor an easy victory 
in his bid for a second four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	It was one of five mayoral contests decided in Texas cities on  
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Kirk won nearly 74 percent of the fewer than 38,000 votes  
cast in Dallas on Saturday as only 5 percent of voters took part. 
Two challengers polled a total of 10,000 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk called the outcome ``an affirmation of my leadership  
style.'' He had promised to focus his second term on fixing 
streets, maintaining public safety and promoting economic 
development in south Dallas, the city's poorest section. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio Mayor Howard Peak took 85 percent of the votes in a  
five-way race, with a 7.5 percent turnout. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio voters also approved a $140.2 million package to  
improve streets, drainage, flood control, parks and recreation, 
libraries and public safety. 
</P>
<P>
	El Paso Mayor Carlos Ramirez pulled in 56 percent to beat three  
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	The only incumbent mayor to fall was Henry Gonzalez of  
Brownsville. He was defeated by Blanca Sanchez Vela. With all 
ballots counted, Ms. Vela received 4,700 votes, or 56 percent to 
Gonzalez's 44 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Grady Barr, former president of the Abilene Chamber of Commerce,  
was elected mayor in Abilene with 63 percent of the vote, defeating 
A.R. ``Fal'' Falcioni. The incumbent, Gary McCaleb, did not seek 
re-election.

<HEADLINE> Is End of Bull Market Run Near? / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Even if the bull market in stocks remains as  
healthy as ever, analysts worry that many aggressive investors are 
headed for a painful letdown. 
</P>
<P>
	It defies reason, they say, to expect the market averages to  
keep climbing in the future as fast as they have in the recent 
past, fresh from four consecutive years of 20 percent-plus gains. 
</P>
<P>
	While the stock-price indexes keep gaining ground, sudden  
changes in trends within the bull market can still take a heavy 
toll on ``momentum'' investors who like to own the hottest stocks 
of the day, or on day traders playing the market through the 
screens of personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mean to imply that the bull market is coming to an  
end, but investors must lower their expectations for market 
returns,'' says H. Vernon Winters, chief investment officer at 
Mellon Private Asset Management. 
</P>
<P>
	``Individuals are enraptured with stocks,'' Winters said in a  
luncheon speech to the Estate Planning Council of New York City 
last week. After taking a recent look at some establishments where 
the customers were day-trading stocks, Winters concluded, ``this is 
going to end very badly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wild market,'' adds Yale Hirsch, an Old Tappan, N.J.,  
adviser who has published the newsletter Smart Money and the annual 
Stock Trader's Almanac for more than 25 years. ``A shift by a 
fraction of a percent of the money at work can send some stocks 
flying and others plunging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since the bull market took off on its latest run, in 1995,  
analysts and money managers have warned repeatedly that stocks 
could not keep up the pace they were setting indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the market has chalked up one year after another of  
powerful gains, their warnings have been drowned out by the roar of 
the bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it time to adjust expectations for future returns upward?  
Absolutely not,'' says Gus Sauter, who oversees the hugely popular 
index funds at the Vanguard Group in Valley Forge, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Half of the stock market gains over the past 15 years are due  
to increases in price-earnings ratios,'' Sauter says in a current 
report to Vanguard investors. ``So the only way to achieve future 
gains of the same magnitude is to have further dramatic increases 
in P-E ratios, or valuation levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, valuations are higher than they have ever been, so  
it's hard to make a compelling case that we're going to get any 
substantial increases in valuations from here. 
</P>
<P>
	``If current valuation levels remain intact, then future stock  
market returns can come from only two sources: Earnings growth and 
dividends. Earnings have typically grown at about 6 percent per 
year, and the current dividend yield is less than 1.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``So a reasonable estimate of returns over the next decade is 8  
percent annually, and that's assuming that valuation levels don't 
decline, which they very well could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Winters said, ``Stock prices are very high, but  
conditions are really wonderful. Innovation, mainly in the form of 
technology, is allowing the U.S. economy to grow much faster than 
anyone thought possible. We expect continued growth, low inflation, 
and interest rates remaining low. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem I have is valuation. I love the Internet, but is  
it really that easy to make money? I think large U.S. growth stocks 
are perhaps the most overpriced asset in the world at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winters concluded, ``We think that the bull market will  
continue, but it is in a maturing phase.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Airstrikes Will Go On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton welcomed Yugoslavia's  
dramatic release today of three U.S. soldiers, but his 
administration rebuffed Slobodan Milosevic's request for a pause in 
the airstrikes and for a meeting with the president until the Serb 
leader agrees to all NATO demands. 
</P>
<P>
	``This gesture ... of goodwill cannot obliterate or overcome the  
stench of evil and death that has been inflicted in those killing 
fields in Kosovo,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen said on NBC's 
``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen and other U.S. officials sounded a hardline, suggesting  
Milosevic had simply engaged in a ``PR stunt'' in releasing the 
American prisoners. But the administration was coming under 
pressure from a variety of sources to seek a diplomatic end to the 
crisis -- from the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who arranged the soldiers' 
release, to two top Republican leaders in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``As Jesse Jackson would say, 'Give peace a chance here,'''  
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' 
``There seems to be some momentum. There's seems to be an 
opportunity. We should seize this moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Whip Tom Delay, R-Texas, told ``Fox News Sunday''  
that Clinton should meet Milosevic to negotiate an end to ``this 
failed policy of bombing for diplomacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians, who have been seeking a diplomatic solution for  
weeks, won an audience with Clinton on Monday. A spokesman for Rep. 
Curt Weldon, R-Pa., said he had worked out a peace plan with 
Russian legislators in Vienna, Austria, requiring an armed 
international peacekeeping force in Kosovo. But Milosevic hasn't 
accepted yet and Weldon didn't have White House authority to 
negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton gave little ground, insisting that NATO airstrikes, now  
in their sixth week, would continue unabated until Milosevic agrees 
to withdraw troops from the Serbian province of Kosovo and allow 
ethnic Albanians to return under self-rule and the protection of an 
armed NATO-led force. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we welcome our soldiers home, our thoughts also turn to the  
over 1 million Kosovars who are unable to go home because of the 
policies of the regime in Belgrade,'' Clinton said in a statement. 
``Today we reaffirm our resolve to persevere until they, too, can 
return -- with security and self government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he was grateful to Jackson, whose personal  
mission to the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade won freedom for the 
prisoners of war after more than a month in captivity. They were 
flown, with Jackson, to an Army hospital in Germany and were to be 
reunited with their families as soon as Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also discussed the latest developments in a 15-minute  
phone conversation Sunday with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, a 
White House official said. In talks with Moscow, which opposes the 
airstrikes, Milosevic has suggested allowing ethnic Albanians to 
return to Kosovo under protection of a lightly armed U.N.-led force 
-- proposals U.S and NATO officials have rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin plans to meet  
Monday with Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, presidential 
spokesman Jake Siewert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior administration officials questioned Milosevic's motives.  
</P>
<P>
	The POWs' release comes as intensifying NATO airstrikes attack  
40,000 Serb forces in the province of Kosovo and the Yugoslav 
president's sources of power, including TV transmission stations 
and military, party and personal headquarters. A freshly imposed 
U.S. embargo on all but food and medicine to Serbia and a European 
Union ban on oil shipments also is tightening the economic noose. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, appearing on CBS'  
``Face the Nation,'' called Milosevic a ``master manipulator'' and 
scoffed at his request to meet with Clinton, made in a letter given 
to Jackson to deliver to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds very much like a PR stunt on Milosevic's part,''  
Talbott said. ``The president will stop the bombing, along with the 
other leaders of the alliance, if Milosevic accepts the conditions 
that have been laid out. Period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen promised that the airstrikes would intensify.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are prepared to wage this campaign for some months to  
come,'' he said on NBC. ``We have to keep our focus on what 
Milosevic has done, continues to do and what he has to do in order 
to stop the campaign effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the U.S. military might reciprocate by releasing two  
Serb POWs, Cohen was noncommittal, saying, ``That may come about at 
some time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a second day, Jackson urged a pause in the airstrikes in  
favor of further diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly hope there is a courteous response to his setting  
our prisoners free,'' Jackson told The Associated Press in a 
telephone interview from Germany. ``At some point in time we must 
look forward to a meeting, whether it's President Clinton or 
(British Prime Minister) Tony Blair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a presidential hopeful and former  
Vietnam POW, said Milosevic is likely seeking political advantage 
and believes the soldiers' release ``will aide him in his efforts 
to continue to win this war, which he is winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If Mr. Milosevic wants to improve his image, he can start to  
return those (ethnic Albanian) people to their homes and their 
communities,'' McCain said on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was scheduled Monday to debate a McCain resolution  
granting Clinton the authority to use ``all necessary force and 
other means'' against Yugoslavia, including invasive ground troops 
-- which Clinton and NATO say is not under consideration. But Lott 
said he and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., had won 
agreement from McCain to set the measure aside. With peace 
initiatives underway, ``The timing is not right,'' Lott said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A U.S. fighter jet went down in  
hostile Serb territory today, but the pilot was plucked to safety 
by NATO search-and-rescue forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance pounded Yugoslavia with new attacks, and a  
spokesman said there would be ``no reward'' for Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic for freeing three U.S. soldiers. 
</P>

force, said Jamie Shea, NATO's chief spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy anti-aircraft fire could be heard in the capital Belgrade  
on Sunday evening, and the city was plunged into darkness shortly 
afterward when electric power failed. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO struck a metalworks factory at Valjevo that it has attacked  
before, the state-run Tanjug agency said. A missile hit Sremska 
Mitrovica, 45 miles northwest of Belgrade, killing one woman and 
wounding several other civilians, the private Beta news agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty days into the airstrikes, refugees continued to stream out  
of Kosovo by the thousands. Some entering Albania said Serb border 
police had prevented women and children from Kosovo's 
second-largest city, Prizren, from crossing into the country on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The American POWs, freed in Belgrade and bused to the border,  
walked to freedom in Croatia holding hands with the Rev. Jesse 
Jackson, who negotiated their release. They later flew to a U.S. 
base in Germany and will be reunited with their families on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a pair of setbacks for NATO's air force, an American F-16  
crashed in western Serbia and the alliance reported that a U.S. 
Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier had gone down in the Adriatic Sea the 
previous day. The pilots of both planes were rescued in good 
health, the alliance said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO blamed the F-16 crash on engine failure and said it was  
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav authorities claimed their anti-aircraft gunners had  
shot the fighter-bomber down. Serbian television showed footage of 
metal chunks of the wreckage, some with writing in English, near 
the village of Nakucani, 50 miles west of Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied search-and-rescue units picked up the pilot two hours  
after the pre-dawn crash near the Bosnia-Serbia border, Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first allied plane to go down over Yugoslavia since a  
U.S. F-117 stealth fighter crashed on March 27. The pilot of that 
plane also was rescued. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO also has said it was responsible for bombing a bus north of  
the Kosovo capital, Pristina, on Saturday. The Yugoslav Foreign 
Ministry said the attack killed 47 people and seriously injured 17. 
Grisly footage on Serb television showed body parts and the 
ripped-up shell of the bus. 
</P>
<P>
	Alliance officials said it was ``unfortunate'' that a bus had  
crossed the bridge, which it called a military target. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they allow public traffic over these bridges, they risk a  
lot of lives of their public citizens,'' said Col. Konrad Freytag 
at a NATO military briefing in Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO kept up intense attacks Sunday on Kosovo and elsewhere in  
Yugoslavia, making more than 600 sorties over a 24-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
	Early Sunday, Tanjug reported the strongest attack yet on  
Yugoslavia's second-largest city, Novi Sad. Eleven missiles hit a 
refinery, causing a huge fire and touching off explosions, the news 
agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO also hit targets on Mount Goles south of Pristina and the  
nearby Serb-populated Gracanica village, and as many as seven 
missiles hit a spa near the Kosovo town of Kursumlija along the 
road north to Belgrade, Beta reported. 
</P>
<P>
	At Albania's northern border with Kosovo, some refugees said  
they saw groups of Prizren residents, mostly women and children, 
walking back toward the city from the border and said they had been 
turned back by Serb border police. 
</P>
<P>
	Merita Nucaj, who is eight months pregnant and was allowed in  
Sunday, said the border guards told others: ``You wanted NATO -- now 
the women and children will stay until they get killed by NATO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance launched the air campaign to force Milosevic to  
accept a peace deal for Kosovo, including widespread autonomy for 
the province and 28,000 NATO troops to enforce it. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians made up about 90 percent of Kosovo's prewar  
population of 2 million people. More than 600,000 of them have fled 
Kosovo and Serb forces since NATO's air campaign began March 24.

<HEADLINE>  Elway Makes Retirement Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- He sounded so very upbeat at the start,  
cracking jokes and telling stories about himself and his Denver 
Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	Then John Elway turned to his retirement -- and that's when it  
hit him. 
</P>
<P>
	His face crumpled and the sobs came.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't do it physically anymore, and that's really hard for  
me to say,'' the 38-year-old Elway said Sunday, pausing frequently 
to regain his composure as he addressed the crowd at a suburban 
Denver hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to walk away. I can't explain in words how much  
everyone has meant to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After dazzling fans and confounding defenses for 16 years, the  
quarterback made official what everyone had known for more than a 
week. He delayed the announcement because of the school killings in 
Littleton, and his news conference began with a moment of silence 
for the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, master of the last-minute comeback, becomes the third  
superstar to leave his sport since January, joining Michael Jordan 
and Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	``The over-under in the locker room yesterday was how many times  
I'd cry,'' Elway said through his husky, choked voice. ``I took the 
under.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, after crying some more, he added, ``I lost the bet.''  
</P>
<P>
	Elway, wearing a blue-and-silver ribbon on his suit jacket in  
memory of the shooting victims, was joined on the stage by Broncos 
coach Mike Shanahan and team owner Pat Bowlen. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway's wife, Janet, and their four children sat in the front  
row. The children smiled at their dad's jokes and remained poised 
when he broke down. Janet, however, cried as her husband spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``For 16 years, the family life has focused around me and  
football, and it's time it focuses around them,'' Elway said. ``I 
couldn't ask for a better mom and dad and a better wife. I'm tough 
to live with. Thank God she's still with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked what he'd miss most about Sunday afternoons, Elway  
said, ``I'll never be able to fill the void of playing a football 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he'd miss the huddle and telling talkative tight end  
Shannon Sharpe ``to be quiet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know you're open, I know you're open, I know you're open,''  
Elway said about Sharpe, drawing loud laughs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe attended the news conference along with several other  
current and former teammates, including running back Terrell Davis 
and Elway's heir apparent, Bubby Brister. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it's like Haley's Comet,'' Sharpe said. ``It only  
comes along every 77 years, and I got an opportunity to play with 
him. That's what it's like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For years, the only thing missing from Elway's resume was a  
Super Bowl title, and he took care of that by winning two straight. 
In his final game, he was voted Super Bowl MVP in a 34-19 win over 
Atlanta last January. 
</P>
<P>
	He becomes the only quarterback to retire after winning a Super  
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I truly believe John was the very best to ever play,'' Bowlen  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway was exceptionally durable throughout his career, missing  
only 15 starts because of illness or injury, but his retirement was 
hastened by the sheer wear and tear of professional football. He 
was hit more than any quarterback in NFL history, absorbing 559 
sacks in 256 games. 
</P>
<P>
	He compiled the best passer rating of his career in 1998, but  
his season was interrupted by hamstring, back and rib injuries that 
caused him to miss all or part of six games. His deteriorating, 
arthritic left knee probably will have to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, his toughness and productivity might never be equaled.  
</P>
<P>
	``To John Elway, football was the greatest game in the world,''  
commissioner Paul Tagliabue said in a statement. ``And to the game 
of football, John Elway was the greatest ambassador imaginable. He 
combined talent and character to become an incomparable performer 
and champion on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway talked about many of the memorable moments in his career,  
including The Drive in Cleveland in 1986 -- ``That one put me on the 
map,'' Elway said -- and even his first pro game on Sept. 4, 1983, 
in Pittsburgh when he went 1-for-8 for 14 yards with an 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think I was going to last a year,'' he said. ``Jack  
Lambert was snarling at me with no teeth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Elway came back.  
</P>
<P>
	He guided his team to more victories (148) than any other  
quarterback in NFL history. He threw for 51,475 yards and accounted 
for 54,882 total yards -- second only to Miami's Dan Marino. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the only player ever to pass for 3,000 yards and rush for  
200 yards in seven straight seasons (1985-91). 
</P>
<P>
	Elway also rallied his team to 47 game-saving drives -- more than  
any other quarterback. He was selected to nine Pro Bowls and was 
named the NFL's MVP in 1987. He holds 55 Broncos' regular-season or 
postseason records. 
</P>
<P>
	``They talk about 47 comebacks,'' Shanahan said. ``The thing  
that was so impressive was the concentration level and poise and 
thriving on pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After three ugly Super Bowl losses early in his career, Elway  
began to wonder if he would ever get another opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	But thanks to a dynamic running game designed around Davis,  
Denver went to two straight Super Bowls and won them both. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Green Bay in January 1998, Elway set the tone by  
scrambling and diving into two defenders for a first down to set up 
a Denver touchdown late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In the closing minutes, Elway accounted for his 45th game-saving  
drive, completing a 23-yard pass to Howard Griffith to help set up 
Davis' go-ahead scoring run in the 31-24 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that I've been labeled as the guy who's never been on  
the winning Super Bowl team,'' a jubilant Elway said at the time. 
``Boy, am I glad to get rid of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a personally more satisfying performance a year later, he led  
the Broncos past Atlanta. With the Falcons stacking their defense 
to stop Davis, they dared Elway to beat them. He did, completing 18 
of 29 passes for 336 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway became the first quarterback ever to start in five Super  
Bowls, and the Broncos' 23-10 win over the New York Jets in the AFC 
championship game two weeks earlier gave him a 5-1 record in 
conference championship games -- the best in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
	In retirement, he said he plans to devote more time to his  
family and work on his golf game. He has expressed interest in 
getting into broadcasting, perhaps on the Monday night ABC games. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, who has an economics degree from Stanford, could also  
venture into the business world. He had been part-owner of some of 
the most successful auto dealerships in Denver. He and his partners 
sold them in 1997 for $82.5 million, but Elway's name remains on 
the businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't look at it as a retirement,'' Elway said. ``I look on  
it as graduation. You graduate from high school and you graduate 
from college. I'm graduating from pro football.''

<HEADLINE> German Telekom Denies Move Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Deutsche Telekom AG denied on Sunday a  
magazine report that said it planned to move the headquarters of 
its mobile telecommunications unit to Rome if its planned merger 
with Telecom Italia SpA goes ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Der Spiegel newsmagazine reported in this week's issue that  
Telekom chairman Ron Summer intended to relocate the group's 
T-Mobil unit from Bonn to appease Italian politicians over the 
proposed $82 billion merger plan. 
</P>
<P>
	But a Telekom spokesman denied such relocation plans. He added,  
however, that it was possible that the mobile telecoms division of 
the merged company could be headed by an Italian board member. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti SpA opened a hostile bid for Telecom Italia on Friday,  
and investors are waiting to see whether the Italian government 
will side with Olivetti or back the merger with Deutsche Telekom. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian officials have expressed hope that Telecom Italia, a  
former state-owned monopoly, will remain in Italian hands, and have 
pressed the German government to cut the 72 percent stake it still 
holds in Deutsche Telekom.

	He is the only player ever to pass for 3,000 yards and rush for  
200 yards in seven straight seasons (1985-91). 
</P>
<P>
	Elway rallied his team to 47 game-saving drives in his career --  
more than any quarterback ever. He was selected to nine Pro Bowls 
and was named the NFL's MVP in 1987. He holds 55 Broncos' 
regular-season or postseason records. 
</P>
<P>
	After three ugly Super Bowl losses early in his career, he began  
to wonder if he would ever get another opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	But thanks to a dynamic running game designed around Terrell  
Davis, Denver went to two straight Super Bowls and won them both. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Green Bay in January 1998, Elway set the tone by  
scrambling and diving into two defenders for a first down to set up 
a Denver touchdown late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In the closing minutes, Elway accounted for his 45th game-saving  
drive, completing a 23-yard pass to Howard Griffith to help set up 
Davis' go-ahead scoring run in the 31-24 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that I've been labeled as the guy who's never been on  
the winning Super Bowl team,'' a jubilant Elway said at the time. 
``Boy, am I glad to get rid of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a personally more satisfying performance a year later, he led  
the Broncos past Atlanta. With the Falcons stacking their defense 
to stop Davis, they dared Elway to beat them. He did, completing 18 
of 29 passes for 336 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway became the first quarterback ever to start in five Super  
Bowls, and the Broncos' 23-10 win over the New York Jets in the AFC 
championship game two weeks earlier gave him a 5-1 record in 
conference championship games -- the best in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
	In retirement, he said he plans to devote more time to his  
family and work on his golf game. He owns a string of auto 
dealerships and has expressed an interest in getting into 
broadcasting, perhaps on the Monday night ABC games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough decision,'' Elway said. ``I don't look at it as a  
retirement. I look on it as graduation. You graduate from high 
school and you graduate from college. I'm graduating from pro 
football.''

<HEADLINE> Bill Murray Says He's a Writer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``I'm a writer now,'' Bill Murray announced  
to a crowd of publishers and booksellers, ``and in order to give 
you a feeling for the book that I've written I have come completely 
unprepared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray, co-author of the golf book and memoir ``A Cinderella  
Story,'' was speaking Saturday at BookExpo America, the industry's 
annual convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``I became a writer,'' he continued, ``back in 1999. I had  
approximately, uh, the rest of the month to finish it. And those of 
you who know the month of February know what I'm talking about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He joked about his inability to meet deadlines, apologized for  
exceeding his allotted speaking time and offered encouragement to 
all the independent booksellers in his own special way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never gone to the Internet and sat down and read  
anything,'' he said. ``But I've never gone to the Internet and 
shoplifted, either.''

<HEADLINE>  3 Race Spectators Killed by Debris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Three spectators were killed and at least  
eight injured when struck by debris that flew into the stands after 
a three-car crash in the VisionAire 500 Indy Racing League event 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Spectators sitting in the area where the crash occurred said a  
tire and suspension parts flew into the fourth-turn grandstands at 
Lowe's Motor Speedway and struck the spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	Speedway officials early Sunday identified two of the spectators  
killed as Randy D. Pyatte, 21, and Jeff Patton, no age available, 
both of Connelly Springs. 
</P>
<P>
	Area hospitals reported treating at least eight people,  
including one child who was in critical condition. Hailey McGee, 9, 
of Conover, was flown to Carolinas Medical Center in nearby 
Charlotte with bruises to her brain and lungs. Also flown to 
Carolinas was Jeremy Jones, no age given, of Connelly Springs. He 
was listed in serious condition with a chest injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Three adults flown to University Hospital in Charlotte were  
listed in good condition. Wesley J. Rice, 29, of Newton, had a 
stomach injury; Matthew J. Picklesimer, 26, of Claremont, had a 
head laceration, and Amanda R. Shondelmyer, 11, Hickory, had a head 
laceration and an injured right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the injured were transported by ambulance to Northeast  
Medical Center in Concord. Nathaniel Blosser, 19, of Hickory, was 
treated for a puncture wound and released and David Duncan, 27, of 
Newton, was treated for a shoulder injury and also released. Chad 
Duncan, 22, of Conover, David's brother, was held overnight because 
of a leg injury but hospital officials said he likely would be 
released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	As rescue workers were attending to the injured, the track  
canceled the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a terrible thing,'' said speedway president H.A.  
``Humpy'' Wheeler, who went into the stands where the debris landed 
and tried to comfort some of the spectators. ``It's very 
regrettable. It's something we'll live with for a very, very long 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ninety minutes after the crash, the nearly 50,000 spectators had  
filed out of the track and investigators were working at the 
accident scene, taking measurements and roping off the area. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1.5-mile superspeedway's sprawling infield, about 200  
drivers and crew members gathered for a somber prayer service. 
</P>
<P>
	``My teammates and I are just full of sorrow,'' 1998  
Indianapolis 500 winner Eddie Cheever said. ``Our thoughts and 
prayers are with the individuals and families. The decision to stop 
the race was the right one. We all leave Charlotte with extremely 
heavy hearts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul Jr. and Stan Wattles slammed hard into the fourth-turn  
retaining wall on lap 61 of the 208-lap event and went spinning 
down the front stretch, collecting the car of Scott Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
	Television replays could not show conclusively what kind of  
debris flew into the stands. But Joe Tiano, a Hickory resident who 
was sitting about 150 feet away in a neighboring section of stands, 
said a wheel and suspension parts flew into the seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``It came up here like a rocket and then started bouncing  
around,'' Tiano said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities cleared the section of the stands and the race was  
red-flagged while emergency workers attended to the injured. While 
medical personnel worked, track security employees stood around 
them holding up white sheets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody who was taking pictures had their cameras taken away  
by the cops,'' Tiano said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the spectators who died was sitting in the 15th row, and  
the other two appeared to be about 10 rows higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Within minutes of the crash, the three drivers were examined at  
the infield care center and released, and about 15 minutes later, 
Wheeler went on the public address system to tell fans the race was 
being canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never done anything like this before,'' Wheeler said.  
``But it seemed like the right thing to do in respect to those who 
lost their lives up there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The incident was similar to an accident last July in which three  
spectators were killed by debris after a racing crash at Michigan 
International Speedway. The track later increased the height of its 
catch fences by 2 1/2 feet, to 17 feet, in an effort to prevent a 
recurrence. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte's catch fences were raised to 15 feet in 1997 in  
preparation for the track getting its first IRL race. Charlotte has 
been holding NASCAR Winston Cup races since it opened in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheeler and IRL founder Tony George, who joined him at a hastily  
arranged news conference after the race was canceled, said they 
were unsure from which car the tire came. The cars of both Wattles 
and Paul were missing tires after the crash, but Wattles' impact 
occurred the closest to where the spectators were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hearts go out to everyone up in the stands,'' Wattles said  
after he was released from the infield care center. 
</P>
<P>
	They were the first spectator fatalities in the history of the  
track and the IRL, which was founded in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte allows spectators to sit in all rows of the track's  
seats for Winston Cup races, but for IRL races the speedway bans 
fans from sitting in the bottom seven rows closest to the racing 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Charlotte's been one of the leaders in protecting and  
taking care of their spectators,'' said Leo Mehl, executive 
director of the IRL.

<HEADLINE> Cards' Top Pick Injured in Drill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Wide receiver David Boston, the Arizona  
Cardinals' top draft pick last month, fractured his left shoulder 
blade Sunday during a mini-camp passing drill. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials said Boston, taken at No. 8 overall out of Ohio  
State, will need up to six weeks to heal but should be ready for 
the start of training camp July 30 in Flagstaff. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston was injured when he caught a long pass from Jake Plummer  
over defensive back Corey Chavous and both fell heavily to the 
turf. X-rays showed a hairline fracture of the shoulder blade. 
</P>
<P>
	``We both went up for the ball,'' Chavous said. ``We got our  
feet tangled up and I came down on his shoulder a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston, his left arm in a sling, refused to talk to reporters in  
the locker room after the final day of the team's three-day 
mini-camp.

<HEADLINE> Alleged War Criminals in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Alleged war criminals have found a safe haven in  
the United States in recent years, under the noses of immigration 
officials and sometimes with help from the U.S. government, The 
Boston Globe reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said it found evidence that people from countries  
including Haiti and El Salvador, and people involved in the breakup 
of Yugoslavia, have settled in this country and begun new lives, 
despite evidence of their involvement in serious human rights 
abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	The list includes three alleged participants in ethnic cleansing  
in Yugoslavia; several former associates of Somali strongman 
Mohammed Siad Barre; 16 Haitian military officers; and a Salvadoran 
general accused of covering up the massacre of four American 
churchwomen in 1980, according to the Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a member of the Haitian army high command,'' said Carl  
Dorelien, a former head of personnel for the 7,000-member army that 
seized power from President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991 and 
killed as many as 4,000 civilians. ``I lived like a king in my 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dorelien, who now lives in a resort community in Port St. Lucie,  
Fla., won $3.2 million in a Florida lottery in 1997. At the time, 
lottery officials described him as a penniless immigrant and 
political refugee. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dorelien says the U.S. military got him a five-year visa  
after the corrupt Haitian army was forced from power in 1994 by 
20,000 U.S. troops. Fifteen other Haitian military officers have 
since joined him in the United States and are living mainly in New 
York and Florida, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Cadman, chief of the Immigration and Naturalization  
Service's national security unit, said his agency is concerned 
about the problem of human rights offenders taking shelter here. 
But he said it is relatively rare. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concern is deep, but that doesn't necessarily suggest  
there is a widespread problem,'' Cadman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government has invested millions of dollars in a  
program to hunt down Nazis who slipped into the country after World 
War II. But some human rights monitors say more recent war 
criminals have been overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in the thousands,'' said Gerald Gray, who last year  
founded the Center for Justice and Accountability to track down 
human rights violators and bring them to justice. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco-based center has filed lawsuits against two  
alleged war criminals -- a Bosnian Serb refugee living in Atlanta 
who allegedly tortured prisoners and a former Chilean secret police 
officer living in Miami accused of torturing and executing a former 
government official. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is really appalling to think that the United States has  
become the retirement home of choice for murderers and despots,'' 
said William Ford, a New York attorney whose sister Ita, a nun, was 
killed by members of the Salvadoran National Guard.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Exiles To Protest at Baltimore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- About 75 Cuban exiles boarded two buses Sunday for  
a trip to Maryland, where they plan to protest outside the 
Baltimore Orioles' exhibition game against Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who stepped aboard said they think the game will only  
benefit Cuban President Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the beast of the Caribbean,'' said 55-year-old Marta  
Campos, a member of Unidad Cubana, one of six exile groups that 
helped organize the journey. ``This is a promotion for him. Not a 
game. Only a political game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chartered ``La Cubana'' buses were scheduled to meet about  
two dozen other buses carrying Cuban exiles from Tampa, New Jersey, 
New York and Washington. The protesters planned to hold their 
demonstration outside Camden Yards during Monday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers carried aboard the buses both Cuban and American  
flags, and some sang the Cuban national anthem as they stepped on. 
Some held banners that read ``CASTRO: NEW MANAGER OF THE ORIOLES.'' 
Others wore stickers on their clothing that read, ``No Castro, No 
Problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people don't understand why we react the way we do,''  
said Ramon Saul Sanchez, leader of the exile group Democracy 
Movement. ``That is because they haven't lived the 40 years we have 
of injustice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game will mark the first time a Cuban team has played a  
major league team in the United States. The Orioles already beat 
Cuba 3-2 in 11 innings on March 28 in Havana. It was the first time 
in 40 years a major league team played in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who boarded the buses for the 20-hour trip said they  
aren't directing their protest at the major leagues, or at the 
players who will take the field. But they said they are angry with 
the Clinton administration for allowing the game. 
</P>
<P>
	As the two buses pulled out of a parking lot to begin the  
journey, two cars decorated with Cuban and American flags led the 
way, honking their horns. The exiles chanted, ``Libertad!'' the 
Spanish word for freedom, and ``Human Rights for Cuba!''

<HEADLINE> Conn. Rejected Pats' Owner's Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- In one of the last maneuvers of the failed deal to  
move the New England Patriots to Hartford, Conn., team owner Bob 
Kraft asked Connecticut officials to extend a Sunday deadline to 
back out of the deal without penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut Gov. John Rowland refused to grant the extension on  
Thursday, and the $380 million deal was dead within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	In the aftermath of the negotiations -- which ended with Rowland  
promising legal action against Kraft and possibly the NFL -- details 
are emerging about the final round of talks between the governor 
and the owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Kraft flew to Hartford on Thursday for a face-to-face meeting  
with Rowland. He asked the governor to extend a May 2 deadline, 
after which Kraft would have been liable for damages of up to $100 
million if he backed out of the deal. He wanted another 30 to 60 
days, apparently to pinpoint when the new stadium could be 
completed, The Boston Globe reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Kraft had signed a tentative deal with Rowland in November to  
move the team to Connecticut after the state offered him a deal he 
seemingly couldn't refuse: a new stadium on the Hartford 
waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
	But the deal had seemed on shaky ground as it appeared less and  
less likely that the stadium would be completed by 2002 -- the year 
insisted upon by Kraft. 
</P>
<P>
	In a meeting with consultants on Thursday morning, Kraft was  
told Connecticut's chances of meeting the 2002 deadline were slim. 
There was no immediate decision, but Kraft and his associates 
thought another month or two could help in further assessing the 
plan's viability, the Globe reported, citing unidentified sources 
familiar with the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rowland feared the extension request could give  
Massachusetts more time to solidify a competing offer, or give the 
NFL and Bay State lawmakers more time to try to kill the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	So at Thursday night's meeting in Hartford, Rowland rejected  
Kraft's request, telling him instead ``it was time to fish or cut 
bait.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kraft told Connecticut officials he would get them an answer in  
24 hours, and the officials were optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	But by the next afternoon, the announcement had been made: The  
Patriots would not move south. In a letter to Rowland, Kraft said 
he was walking away because the construction of the stadium would 
likely be further delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Rowland's aides said the news came as a surprise in Hartford.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were 98 percent sure the Patriots were going to go  
forward,'' Rowland spokesman Dean Pagani said. ``They had presented 
no rational arguments for pulling out.''

would like to have longer legs and curls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not unhappy with the way I look now,'' Pfeiffer, 41, says  
in the May 10 issue of People magazine. But ``I really would like 
curls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The movie star is featured on the cover of the magazine's  
special issue, making her the only celebrity to have graced the 
``50 Most Beautiful'' cover twice. 
</P>
<P>
	And Pfeiffer has outdone lookers like Tom Cruise, John F.  
Kennedy Jr., and Mel Gibson -- who have 'only' been on the list five 
times. They were not on it this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Aniston, Benjamin Bratt, and Nicole Kidman are also on  
this years list. 
</P>
<P>
	``A person's looks are a double-edged sword. Sometimes it works  
in your favor, sometimes it works against you,'' Pfeiffer said. 
``All I really care about is that I'm able to age gracefully and 
that I don't ever look like a wax figure of myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pfeiffer, the mother of two children, is married to producer  
David E. Kelley, whose credits include ``The Practice'' and ``Ally 
McBeal.''

<HEADLINE> Cuban Fans Long for Baseball Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Sure, Cuban fans think their team can beat the  
Baltimore Orioles. Everyone else does. 
</P>
<P>
	``On Monday, everyone will leave work early to make sure they  
get home in time for the game,'' said Gerardo Mederos, 29, an 
agronomist who regularly joins other baseball fans in the Parque 
Central -- Havana's Central Park -- to discuss baseball. ``No one 
wants to miss one second of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Monday night's game at Camden Yards approached, passion about  
the event spread across the Cuban capital. There has been no 
official announcement, but Cubans assumed the game would be 
broadcast live on government television. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the first game, Cubans weren't sure how their players  
would do against American big leaguers. But after seeing their 
all-stars lose to the Orioles 3-2 in 11 innings March 28, Cuban 
fans dreamed of seeing their team beat Baltimore, which began 
Sunday with a a 6-17 record, the worst in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Orioles have a good team, but so do we,'' said William  
Quijano, among the sports enthusiasts who gather in the park every 
day. ``Our players are strong, big and are going to have a very 
powerful team of the best players in Cuban baseball. We were not 
able to have that the first time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first game, many of the best players were unable to play  
because they were involved in the playoffs of Cuba's league. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who weren't in the first game but are likely to be  
on Monday's roster were second baseman Antonio Pacheco and first 
baseman and designated hitter Orestes Kindelan. First baseman Omar 
Linares, who played during the first game, is also likely to be on 
the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	As of early Friday, the only list announced by the communist  
sports officials was a 48-man preliminary roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one knows who is going to win, but we really want to win  
and this time we know for sure that we have a chance,'' said 
Orestes Llorente, 61, an office equipment technician who is among 
the most vocal amateur baseball analysts found regularly at the 
ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he worried that protests outside the game by those  
opposed to the government of Cuban President Fidel Castro would mar 
the game. Llorente also seemed upset about the possibility of 
defections by Cubans during the visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``That kind of thing would be very bad,'' Llorente said. ``It is  
a betrayal of confidence. But we have seen in the past that our 
real sports stars, especially baseball stars, always return home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost 300 Cubans were to travel to Baltimore for the game,  
including reporters, retired players, members of youth groups and 
outstanding students. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the better-known athletes in the delegation were former  
boxer Teofilo Stevenson, high jump world record-holder Javier 
Sotomayor and Connie Marrero, who once played with the Washington 
Senators and threw out the ceremonial first pitch in the first 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five school-age Cubans, accompanied by a group of  
parents, are scheduled to play a game Tuesday against a group of 
Baltimore-area Little Leaguers -- just as a group of American 
youngsters played Cuban children during their visit to Havana last 
month.

<HEADLINE> Freed US POWs Reach Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMSTEIN, Germany (AP) -- Three U.S. soldiers held in captivity  
by Yugoslav authorities for more than a month were released and 
left Yugoslavia on Sunday. Holding hands with the Rev. Jesse 
Jackson, they walked into neighboring Croatia chanting ``Free at 
last, free at last, thank God Almighty, free at last!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers arrived Sunday afternoon at the U.S. military base  
in Ramstein in southwest Germany on a C-9 military plane. 
</P>
<P>
	A color guard with flags and a 27-man honor platoon, dressed in  
full combat gear from the soldiers' own division, greeted them on 
the tarmac at the air base along with a crowd of about 200 
well-wishers holding U.S. flags and big ``Welcome Home'' signs. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrival ended 32 days in captivity for the soldiers, who  
marked their release in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade on Sunday 
morning with beaming smiles and calls home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to be free,'' exulted Spc. Steven M. Gonzales in the  
Yugoslav capital. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton gave no indication that he was willing to cede  
anything to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for the gesture. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we welcome our soldiers home, our thoughts also turn to the  
over 1 million Kosovars who are unable to go home because of the 
policies of the regime in Belgrade,'' Clinton said in a White House 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we reaffirm our resolve to persevere until they, too,  
can return -- with security and self-government,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The three soldiers, carrying American flags folded under their  
arms, walked onto the tarmac in Ramstein, saluted the honor guard, 
then immediately boarded two UH-60 medical evacuation helicopters 
to be flown to the nearby Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, a U.S. 
military hospital where they were to undergo medical evaluations. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson urged the warring sides in the Kosovo conflict to move  
from ``battleground to common ground'' and find a diplomatic 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you talk, amazing things happen,'' he said. ``Let's seize  
this great moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two other soldiers were Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez and  
Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid huge smiles and a sense of jubilation in Belgrade, the  
soldiers embraced the U.S. civil rights leader, who said he hoped 
their release would lead to a diplomatic breakthrough in the Kosovo 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in Zagreb, Croatia, the soldiers expressed gratitude to  
Jackson and his delegation for mediating their release. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can never thank them enough, we owe them our freedom,''  
Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzales' parents stayed up most of the night, waiting for their  
son's release. Finally Rosie and Gilbert Gonzales received the 
phone call they'd been waiting for. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `I love you, Mom and Dad. I'm free. I'll see you  
soon,''' Mrs. Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson had called Saturday for NATO to reciprocate Milosevic's  
gesture of releasing the soldiers by calling a pause in its bombing 
campaign. But strikes went on through the night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that the NATO alliance will see this for what it is  
worth and not be cynical about that possibility, because the 
alternative to diplomacy would be a war with no end in sight,'' 
Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers' release could be a sign Milosevic is moving to  
find a way to end the Kosovo crisis. The Yugoslav leader might also 
be trying to improve his image in the United States and to exploit 
anti-war rumblings in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president took the decision in support of Jesse Jackson's  
peace efforts,'' Tanjug said. ``We do not see them as enemies but 
victims of war and militarism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials were cautious in their initial responses to the  
announced release. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the release of the  
prisoners would have no effect on NATO's air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon also said it was premature to talk about a reciprocal  
release of Yugoslav prisoners. The United States captured one 
prisoner two weeks ago, and Bacon said NATO is now holding a 
second. He released no details on the second capture, except to say 
it was ``very recently,'' apparently within the last 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials had previously all but ruled out a prisoner  
exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson made several pleas Saturday for NATO to halt its  
airstrikes, saying ``in the coming days, we shall urge all parties 
to seize upon this initiative'' and undertake new negotiations to 
end the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone, 25, was from Smiths Creek, Michigan; Gonzales, 22, from  
Huntsville, Texas; and Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	During their meeting Saturday, Jackson said Milosevic addressed  
the four points raised by the United States and NATO: halting the 
violence in Kosovo, allowing the return of refugees, the presence 
of a multinational force and a political solution to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``But he is going to send to President Clinton a letter laying  
out his response to those four basic concerns, the desire to meet 
with him and to take this matter to resolution through 
negotiations,'' Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Jackson's religious delegation said that during the  
meeting Jackson prayed with Milosevic and held his hand. Then, the 
whole American and Yugoslav delegation held hands and bowed their 
heads in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson had met with the three soldiers Friday in Belgrade, and  
the three told him of being held in isolation. The Friday meeting 
with Jackson was the first time the three had seen each other since 
their capture. They appeared generally healthy, but still showed 
cuts and bruises they suffered when captured. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance launched the air campaign to force Milosevic to  
accept a Western-dictated peace deal for Kosovo, including 
widespread autonomy for the province and 28,000 NATO troops to 
enforce it. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians comprised about 90 percent of Kosovo's prewar  
population of 2 million people. More than 600,000 of them have fled 
Kosovo and Serb forces since the alliance's air campaign began.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers Accused of Cuba Recruiting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Two Cuban minor leaguers say the Los Angeles  
Dodgers held secret tryouts for them in their homeland, arranged 
their escapes and then ordered them to lie about it, according to 
The Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	First baseman Juan Carlos Diaz, 23, and outfielder Josue Perez,  
21, have asked the commissioner's office to declare them free 
agents on grounds they were signed illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	If true, the Dodgers' actions would violate baseball rules  
prohibiting scouting in Cuba. They also may violate the U.S. trade 
embargo against the communist nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand that nobody should go to Cuba,'' Dodgers senior  
vice president Ralph Avila told the Globe. ``Look, I don't work for 
the immigration. I don't work for the State Department. I don't 
work for the police department. If someone went to Cuba, it's not 
my business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pablo Peguero, the scout accused of arranging the defections,  
said he hasn't been to Cuba in more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz said Peguero approached him in 1995 after a game in Havana  
and offered a tryout for the next morning. Afterward, Diaz said, 
Peguero told him the Dodgers wanted to bring him to the Dominican 
Republic. Two months later, Peguero returned with a woman he said 
was his cousin. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz received a visa after the woman told authorities his family  
helped her find a Cuban doctor for surgery she needed. She said she 
had invited Diaz to the Dominican Republic to show her gratitude 
and paid all his expenses, Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz went to the Dodgers' training academy at Campo Las Palmas  
outside Santo Domingo, where Avila signed him to a contract with a 
$65,000 bonus. Last year, Diaz hit a combined 30 homers at Single-A 
and Double-A. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if they paid off people or what, but I  
immediately got my provisional residency papers, which enabled me 
to sign,'' Diaz said, adding that Peguero and Avila told him to lie 
if asked how he escaped to the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, who plays for the Dodgers' Single-A team at Vero Beach,  
Fla., told a similar story in a separate interview. He said after a 
1996 tryout with Peguero he was escorted to the Dominican Republic 
by a young woman he never saw again. Perez was signed to a contract 
with a $40,000 bonus, and also was told to lie about his escape, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The players said they came forward after realizing their signing  
bonuses were low. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioner's office has said teams breaking rules against  
scouting in Cuba face fines, suspensions or loss of amateur draft 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
	In the only documented case of scouting in Cuba, Miami-based  
agent Juan Ignacio Hernandez was arrested for trying to persuade 
players to defect. Hernandez was sentenced to 15 years in prison by 
Cuban authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Dodgers did recruit players from Cuba, they could be in  
violation of the 36-year trade embargo prohibiting American 
companies from conducting business on the island. Individuals can 
be fined up to $55,000 for violations, and corporations up to 
$250,000.

<HEADLINE> Golfer Elkington Has Meningitis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THE WOODLANDS, Texas (AP) -- Steve Elkington was being treated  
Sunday for viral meningitis, an illness that sidelined the PGA Tour 
player for a time last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Elkington, a 36-year-old Australian who attended the University  
of Houston and lives in Houston, withdrew Sunday from the Shell 
Houston Open. He went to a Houston hospital Saturday night 
complaining of severe headaches and spent the night. He remained 
there Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve contracted viral meningitis again like he did last  
year,'' Brian Peters, a spokesman for International Management 
Group, Elkington's agent, told Houston television station KRIV 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not life-threatening but he is in a lot of pain. We  
expect him to be out of the hospital in a few days and back on the 
tour in a few weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elkington was five strokes behind leader Hal Sutton entering the  
final round. Stuart Appleby won the tournament by one stroke over 
Sutton and John Cook. 
</P>
<P>
	Elkington spent most of 1998 fighting health problems, including  
meningitis that was diagnosed just before last year's Byron Nelson 
Classic. He bounced back to win the Buick Challenge in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Elkington picked up his 10th career win in March at the Doral  
Ryder Open and is 12th on the PGA money list this year with 
$776,263. His career victories include two titles at the Players 
Championships and the 1995 PGA Championship.

<HEADLINE> Graham To Lead Prayer at Indy 500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Rev. Billy Graham has been chosen to  
give the invocation at the Indianapolis 500 on May 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony George, president of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway,  
personally invited Graham to give the invocation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm honored to be invited,'' Graham said Saturday. ``I have  
never been there for the 500. I have flown over the Speedway when 
it was on several times. But to be there and to give the prayer 
will be a great honor for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The evangelist will preach for four nights starting June 3  
during his Indianapolis crusade. Organizers expect 200,000 people 
to attend the Christian revival. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham's prayer will break a 25-year tradition at the race.  
Since 1974, the invocation has been given by the Catholic 
archbishop of Indianapolis.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Women Beat Japan in Soccer 7-0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLARKSTON, Ga. (AP) -- Mia Hamm broke an eight-game scoreless  
drought and reserve forward Danielle Fotopolous added two goals to 
lead the U.S. women's soccer team to a 7-0 rout of Japan on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans, coming off a 9-0 thrashing of Japan on Thursday,  
take the next week off, their final break before the World Cup 
begins in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Before a DeKalb Memorial Stadium crowd of 14,652, Japanese  
goalkeeper Naoko Nishigai was under heavy pressure early. Hamm 
served up a perfect cross pass to Shannon MacMillan, who knocked 
home a point-blank shot for the first goal with 17 minutes gone. 
</P>
<P>
	A minute later, Hamm scored from 30 yards out for her 105th  
international goal, three shy of the all-time record. 
</P>
<P>
	Fotopolous came on as a second-half substitute and knocked home  
an easy cross from MacMillan in the 64th minute. Fotopolous, who 
broke Hamm's collegiate goal-scoring record, drilled a header from 
a perfect corner kick by Christie Pearce four minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Whalen, MacMillan and Tisha Venturini completed the scoring  
with goals in the final 10 minutes of the game.

<HEADLINE> Murdered Grandmother Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- John Rizzotti was age 8 when his  
great-grandmother died. He was 10 when he found out how. 
</P>
<P>
	That was when he stumbled across a box of horrors -- news  
clippings, autopsy reports, pictures -- that laid out the last 
terrifying moments of life for 78-year-old Leah Schendel, stripped 
from the chest down and battered with punches that broke her 
dentures and stopped her frail heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen years later, the pain hasn't gone away.  
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Mrs. Schendel's killer, Manuel Babbitt, is scheduled  
to pay for that crime with his life. Only then, Rizzotti thinks, 
will he start to get over his great-grandmother's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want him to feel the exact same fear that she felt when he  
threw himself through her door,'' he says. ``I want him to feel 
that pain that we had when we had no grandmother for Christmas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt's supporters, who argue he was in the grip of a Vietnam  
flashback when he killed, say Rizzotti's feelings are 
understandable but mistaken. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be no closure here because hate doesn't die,'' says  
defense lawyer Chuck Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The last night of Leah Schendel's life started well.  
</P>
<P>
	Her brother, Aaron Weinberg, and his wife had come to Sacramento  
and taken her to a sister's house for dinner. Later, they brought 
her back to her garden apartment in a senior citizens' complex, 
carefully walking her to the door. 
</P>
<P>
	As she often did, Mrs. Schendel locked her screen door and left  
the inside one open for air. Judging by how the apartment was later 
found, she dealt a hand of solitaire, a game she loved to play, and 
turned the TV to a channel showing war movies. 
</P>
<P>
	The next morning, Dec. 19, 1980, the landlady found her  
half-naked body under a mattress. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Thompson, Mrs. Schendel's granddaughter, recalls trying to  
clean up her grandmother's ransacked apartment and watching her 
mother find a pillow soaked in blood. ``I'll never forget that 
scream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Smiling out from family photos, Mrs. Schendel is the  
silver-haired picture of grandmotherhood. 
</P>
<P>
	The family called her ``Gramma.'' They remember how she used to  
pass out silver dollars from her occasional trips to Reno -- ``I 
don't think she ever went bigger than the nickel machines,'' Ms. 
Thompson says with a laugh -- and how she loved being around her 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Thompson doesn't remember her grandmother talking much about  
her own past, her childhood as a turn-of-the-century Jewish 
immigrant, what happened to other branches of the family -- ``You 
could never talk to her about the Holocaust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She does remember her grandmother being firmly fixed in the  
present, making afghans, taking a class to learn to make 
professional-looking ceramics, cooking batches of latkes -- potato 
pancakes -- for Hanukah. 
</P>
<P>
	She never had a driver's license, but that didn't stop her from  
getting around. Ms. Thompson recalls how her just-under-5-foot, 
100-pound grandmother would drag a shopping cart back and forth to 
the local supermarket to get groceries under her own steam. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a very independent lady,'' she says.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt has family, too.  
</P>
<P>
	His brother, Bill, who turned Babbitt in to police, made a  
moving plea at a hearing in April as he asked Gov. Gray Davis to 
show mercy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm up here shaking like a leaf because as I'm running out of  
patience for justice. My brother Manny's running out of ... time,'' 
he said. ``I don't want Manny's blood on my hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Davis rejected Babbitt's clemency bid. Defense  
attorneys are making a last attempt to stay the execution with an 
appeal asking the state Supreme Court to throw out Babbitt's 
conviction and order a new trial on the grounds that attorney 
misconduct made his original defense flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenders say Babbitt, who received a Purple Heart for his  
service in the 77-day siege of Khe Sanh, one of the bloodiest 
battles of the Vietnam war, was suffering post-traumatic stress 
disorder when he murdered Mrs. Schendel and was not in his right 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
	They also argue that his trial lawyer did a terrible job of  
defending him in 1982 and they question whether Babbitt, who is 
black, got impartial treatment from the all-white jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those trying to get Babbitt's life spared were a Florida  
prosecutor, scores of Khe Sanh veterans and David Kaczynski -- who 
like Bill Babbitt, tipped police to the wrongdoing of a brother, in 
his case Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Thompson understands why the Babbitts fight for life. ``My  
heart goes out to the Babbitts. I would never want to be in their 
shoes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she hopes they lose.  
</P>
<P>
	``We want justice to be done,'' she says. ``The only way you can  
get justice is to have the death penalty and to have the execution 
carried out to show people you just can't go out there and kill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rizzotti, Ms. Thompson's nephew, hopes to see Babbitt die.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to say that about another person's life. We don't  
like the fact that another person is dying in this case, but ... 
there's no way around it,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he did destroyed an entire family.''

<HEADLINE> Couple Cultivates 2 Million Worms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REA, Pa. (AP) -- A few times each day, Kay Ihnat grabs a  
paintbrush, scrapes away the top layer of dirt from a pile and 
uncovers what looks like a handful of fettucini in red sauce. 
</P>
<P>
	Fettucini that moves, that is.  
</P>
<P>
	Ihnat and her husband, John, keep 2 million redworms in wooden  
boxes and pickup truck beds in an old dairy barn near the small 
southwestern Pennsylvania village of Rea. 
</P>
<P>
	The redworms -- Lumbricus rubellus to scientists -- are shipped  
across the country for bait at $10 to $18 a pound and in worm 
recycling boxes that sell for $35 to $2,289.50. The biggest kits 
are for schools, where worms are a fun science project. 
</P>
<P>
	``Worm farming is the kind of thing you can do in your  
backyard,'' Jayson Harper, a farm economics professor at Penn State 
University, said Wednesday. ``It's very low-tech -- something even a 
kid could do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The kid would have to work pretty hard, however.  
</P>
<P>
	It takes about 45 minutes just to get a few pounds of worms out  
of a shovelful of dirt on a plywood production line. A bright light 
the worms dislike is aimed at the pile, forcing them down slowly. 
The top layer of dirt is then swept off, and the process starts 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	The farm requires so much labor -- from hauling manure and rotten  
lettuce for worm food to bagging soil enriched with worm waste for 
potting soil -- that none of the Ihnats' six children is interested 
in taking over. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's driving us crazy,'' Kay Ihnat said. ``You'll see an ad  
in the newspaper a few years from now when we are old and gray -- 
`Worm farm for sale.''' 
</P>
<P>
	It could be a good investment. The Ihnats are about to add their  
fourth roomful of worm-raising beds to complement the 42 beds they 
have now. Kay Ihnat said she is thinking about getting a chair 
instead of a couch for their den so she can have more room to store 
outgoing worms and worm kits. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest challenge in running a worm farm is marketing, John  
Ihnat said. The growth area for the worm business is recycling 
boxes. They come in designer colors and can sit beneath someone's 
sink. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecology is the big selling point. Not surprisingly, worm boxes  
are more popular in California. Harper, the Penn State farming 
professor, said some small towns have even tried worm recycling for 
leaves and grass clippings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Half of the people just don't want worms in their house, and  
there is nothing you can say to them,'' said Kay Ihnat, who speaks 
at schools as the ``Worm Lady.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The other half you try to appeal to,'' she said. ``Think of  
all the biodegradable waste that's sitting out there in landfills, 
in non-biodegradable bags. And if you run the garbage disposal, 
that takes an average of eight gallons of water a day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What's yummy for the family dog -- meats and cheeses -- are bad  
for worms. So are oranges, but not grapefruit, strangely enough. 
Everything else that will decompose in nature is good -- including 
newspaper, eggshells and coffee grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ihnats took up worm farming after getting married six years  
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The pitfalls were many, including the fact that worms kept dying  
on delivery trucks. A switch to the U.S. Postal Service, which has 
climate control in the back of its vehicles, saved the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Kay Ihnat, a former lab manager at a cancer clinic, had tried  
and failed at a wallpaper business. John Ihnat was tired of chasing 
dairy cows around the weeping willows on the family homestead and 
had investigated emu, ostrich and rabbit farming as well as hops 
fields for beer. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple decided on worm farming after getting married, just  
three months after Kay Ihnat met her husband at a bachelor auction. 
The Ihnats have six daughters from previous marriages. 
</P>
<P>
	The thrifty couple later plucked a cement mixer from a garbage  
dump to use for mixing dirt, got a great deal on equipment from a 
worm farm that went bust, and fought off moles and three especially 
pesky raccoons. 
</P>
<P>
	The good thing is that worms breed fast, so fast they make  
rabbits look celibate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just phenomenal. I tried to figure out the math on it  
once, and I had to give up. They sit down there in the dark all 
day, so they have nothing else to do,'' Kay Ihnat said.

<P>
	Some facts about worms and worm farming:  
</P>
<P>
	-- A pound of redworms will eat a pound of garbage in two days.  
Feeding the worms too much attracts mites, which compete with the 
worms for food. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Worm farmers prefer redworms to nightcrawlers because they are  
easier to raise, but nightcrawlers are generally considered to be 
better bait. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A mature redworm grows a band around the middle. If faced with  
a shortage of food, ``the older ones will quit eating and die just 
so the little ones can eat,'' worm farmer Kay Ihnat said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Building and stocking a wooden worm bed that produces 168  
pounds of worms per year costs about $300. Three hours a week are 
needed to harvest a bed of that size. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Worm waste, also called castings, contains calcium, magnesium,  
nitrogen and phosphates and potash that can help plants grow.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Gore Addresses School Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tipper Gore says parents and other adults  
should take greater care with children's mental health after the 
Littleton, Colo. school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are serious about stopping the violence and helping our  
children, we as adults need to erase the stigma that prevents our 
kids from getting the help they need for their mental health,'' 
Mrs. Gore, the wife of Vice President Al Gore, said in an essay 
written for this week's edition of Time magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we know a child is depressed or alienated, we need to take  
emergency action and stay involved with the problem,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	An advocate for mental health issues, Mrs. Gore said, ``The  
alarm that sounded in Littleton should wake up all Americans to the 
special needs of our children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The toxic culture of guns and screen violence that kids have  
to navigate has been created by adults who are supposed to offer 
protection and guidance,'' she added.

<HEADLINE> Letters Convey Pain From HS Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- They wrote to say how sorry they were  
about the massacre at Columbine High. They wrote of their tears. 
They wrote about their concerns for the wounded and the frightened. 
</P>
<P>
	One woman in Eagle Creek, Ore., wrote on behalf of her  
5-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the news they kept showing a young man crawling out of a  
second story broken window on to the top of a police van,'' the 
woman, who signed her letter ``The Hill family,'' wrote in bubbly 
cursive. ``Could someone please let us know how he is? This picture 
in particular bothered our son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Patrick Ireland could write back right now, the woman would  
be relieved to know that he is getting better from his head wounds. 
Still in the hospital, the 17-year-old's condition has been 
upgraded from serious to fair. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Metro Denver Chamber of Commerce has received dozens  
of letters. Hundreds more have arrived at a special post office box 
set up after the April 20 shootings, in which 12 students, a 
teacher and the two student gunmen died. 
</P>
<P>
	Some are Hallmark cards; some are written longhand on notebook  
paper. Some are typed or laser-printed; some are posters signed by 
entire senior classes in other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Few want a response from anyone. Some offer help, some offer  
understanding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want you to feel better at this sad time,'' wrote Kalen, a  
second-grader at Moon Mountain School in Phoenix. ``I lost my dad 
like you lost your son or daughter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She drew a smiley face on her letter.  
</P>
<P>
	One of her classmates sent a drawing of heaven. Little  
stick-figure angels stand on clouds, and one cloud says ``Cheer 
up!'' And Carly, another classmate, wrote: ``Dear Denver, I hope 
you feel better. I am so sorry!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the cards and letters were inspired by live television  
images of terrified students running from the school and then 
recounting the nightmare in interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please give this card to the girl I saw on TV that stated she  
begged the gunman not to shoot her,'' wrote Laverne A. Kammerzell 
of Woodward, Okla. ``She resembled my granddaughter so much. My 
heart was broken to think she begged for her life for 30 minutes 
and then saw the girl in front of her get shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One woman wrote that she and two sons -- one in high school, one  
older -- were glued to the TV the day of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``My two boys that were there with me were so upset and  
concerned about everyone and how the students were doing, and I 
caught myself crying,'' wrote Joyce Hulett of Buckner, Mo. ``I did 
not let my family see me during that because they were already 
upset enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The writers have done a lot of crying, tears for people they've  
never met. 
</P>
<P>
	``My tears may not be seen by you, but they were shed in pain  
from the loss of your children,'' wrote Kelly Wayne of Brandon, 
Fla. ``I pray for a great move of God to help you understand that 
angels don't always get to stay here as long as we'd like them 
to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A woman in Idaho wrote that she wept until she had no more  
tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cried as I heard the three young people talking,'' wrote  
Valerie Pareja of Boise. ``How the young man forced the girls to 
the floor, and then covered them with his body, to shield them. To 
keep them safe. To sacrifice himself for them. That was the most 
wonderful display of love I have ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most writers lamented their helplessness.  
</P>
<P>
	``We sincerely wish there were something we could do to  
physically relieve your pain but there is not,'' wrote Sandy Ayers, 
representing a Star Trek club in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Larson of Findlay, Ohio, said he wished he could help in  
some little way. He hoped his letter would do. 
</P>
<P>
	``Remember,'' he added, ``there are others that are looking on  
and know how much it hurts.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bill Murray Says He's a Writer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``I'm a writer now,'' Bill Murray announced  
to a crowd of publishers and booksellers, ``and in order to give 
you a feeling for the book that I've written I have come completely 
unprepared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray, co-author of the golf book and memoir ``A Cinderella  
Story,'' was speaking Saturday at BookExpo America, the industry's 
annual convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``I became a writer,'' he continued, ``back in 1999. I had  
approximately, uh, the rest of the month to finish it. And those of 
you who know the month of February know what I'm talking about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He joked about his inability to meet deadlines, apologized for  
exceeding his allotted speaking time and offered encouragement to 
all the independent booksellers in his own special way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never gone to the Internet and sat down and read  
anything,'' he said. ``But I've never gone to the Internet and 
shoplifted, either.''

<HEADLINE> Families of POWs React to Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALDWIN PARK, Calif. (AP) -- The families of the three U.S.  
servicemen held captive in Yugoslavia shared tearful telephone 
conversations with the men after they were released Sunday 
following a 32-day ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Spc. Steven Gonzales and Staff Sgts. Andrew Ramirez and  
Christopher Stone all called their families on a cellular phone 
after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic allowed them to be 
released to the Rev. Jesse Jackson at the Yugoslav army press 
center in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	``All three of them said almost to the letter in talks to their  
loved ones, 'I am free, I am free,''' Jackson said. ``'I love you 
very much. I hope to see you soon.' That was the message.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stone family spokesman Maj. James McCrone, a public relations  
officer at Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Harrison Township, 
Mich., said relatives of Stone, of Smiths Creek, Mich., might board 
a plane to Europe on Sunday to be reunited with the serviceman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, they're very excited and they're anxious to see  
Chris. They're very thankful for Rev. Jackson and the others who 
have been involved in Chris' release,'' he said. ``Grateful and 
appreciative really captures the essence of what they are 
feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to their release, the families said they would keep their  
televisions on and phone lines open waiting for the good news. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm waiting for the big call that they're on the bus and on  
their way out,'' Ramirez's mother, Vivian Ramirez, said at a news 
conference Saturday. She said she would ``wait with the phone next 
to me ... until they call me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what she would do when she sees her son, Mrs. Ramirez  
said: ``Cry. I will hug him, and then I will not let go.'' She 
called Jackson ``a lifesaver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Ramirez, of Los Angeles, said she had been told by the Army  
she would likely travel to Germany to be reunited with her son. The 
men were expected to be taken to Landstuhl Hospital in Ramstein, 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	In Huntsville, Texas, the parents of Gonzales excitedly awaited  
his release. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just thank God so much for answering our prayers,'' Rosie  
Gonzales, the soldier's mother, told reporters. ``We can't wait to 
hold him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzales, 22, Ramirez, 24, and Stone, 25, were taken captive  
March 31 while patrolling the Yugoslav-Macedonia border as part of 
a peacekeeping mission, seven days after NATO launched its bombing 
campaign in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Tricia Stone, Stone's wife, was ``packed and ready to go'' in  
the event of her husband's release, said her stepmother, Lisa 
McKinney. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is praying and she is very hopeful that it is true,'' she  
said. Mrs. Stone and the couple's 4-year-old son, Ryan, have been 
staying with Ms. McKinney in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors who went to the Ramirez home were filled with hope,  
many bearing flowers. ``I feel wonderful now,'' said Lala Szalonek, 
72, who brought a brimming vase. ``I'm excited. I'm shaking 
inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Capac, Mich., near Stone's hometown, Linda Eldred spent the  
day adorning her downtown floral-and-gift shop with new yellow bows 
-- and making many more to give away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't known that kind of excitement since my brother and  
husband came home from Vietnam,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Race Deaths Raise Safety Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- For the second time in nine months a crash  
at a major open-wheel auto race in the United States has killed 
three spectators, raising questions about safety at the events. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every once in a while, unfortunately, auto racing raises the  
black side of itself,'' Lowe's Motor Speedway president H.A. 
``Humpy'' Wheeler said Sunday as authorities tried to piece 
together evidence from a fatal accident at the track Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people were killed and eight hurt, including a 9-year-old  
girl who was critically injured, when debris from a three-car wreck 
flew into the stands during the VisionAire 500 Pep Boys Indy Racing 
League event. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said the force of the crash at speeds near 215 mph  
rocketed a wheel and suspension parts over a 15-foot-high catch 
fence at the exit of the fourth turn. The debris flew into the 
grandstands and slammed into spectators, some of them seated 
several dozen rows above the 1.5-mile, high-banked superspeedway. 
</P>
<P>
	As shrieking spectators sought help, rescue workers converged on  
the bloody area in a scenario eerily similar to that at Michigan 
Speedway last July 26, when three spectators were killed in a Champ 
Car race. The cause in that event also was a broken wheel and 
suspension parts that hurdled a catch fence. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to keep wheels from flying off at impact, the  
Formula One circuit this year began requiring its teams to use 
tethers designed to keep the wheels and suspension connected to the 
main body of the machine. 
</P>
<P>
	Such tethers are not required on either Champ Cars or IRL  
machines, in part because some racing authorities think the devices 
may solve one problem while creating another. 
</P>
<P>
	Leo Mehl, executive director of the IRL, said there is concern  
that while tethers may prevent parts from flying off cars and 
hitting fans, they also may put drivers in greater danger because 
the parts could snap back and hit them instead. A tethered wheel 
also could be especially dangerous if it is launched into the 
stands in a slingshot fashion, Mehl said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have spent a lot of time looking at that regulation and  
discussing it,'' Mehl said, adding that the IRL feels the matter 
needs more study. ``You must be very cautious that you don't make 
regulations that will make things worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mehl said the IRL would work with the suburban Charlotte track  
to determine if anything can be done to prevent a recurrence. The 
height of Charlotte's catch fence conforms to industry standards, 
but it was difficult to tell how much higher the fence would have 
had to be to keep the debris from reaching the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have very little direct film of the accident,'' Mehl said.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheeler said the IRL and the speedway planned their own  
investigations to augment the efforts of their insurers, ``to make 
sure that this never happens again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three people killed were Randy D. Pyatte, 21, and Jeff  
Patton, no age available, both of Connelly Springs, and Dexter B. 
Mobley, 41, of Statesville. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the eight people hospitalized were released by Sunday  
evening. The lone exception was Hailey McGee, 9, of Conover, who 
was in critical condition at Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte 
with bruises to her brain and lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	The fatalities were the first involving spectators for both the  
IRL, which was founded in 1996, and the speedway, which opened in 
1960. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheeler, who has long been known as one of the sport's most  
outgoing promoters and an innovator in creative pre-race shows, 
remained visibly shaken Sunday afternoon, about 18 hours after the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've talked to a lot of people who have been through it, but I  
certainly understand it a lot better now,'' said Wheeler, who went 
to the grandstand after the crash and tried to comfort some of the 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The speedway canceled the race shortly after the accident and  
said it would refund the ticket prices for the approximately 50,000 
spectators. Shortly after the announcement was made, however, some 
people began calling the speedway's switchboard to say the track 
could earmark their refunds for a trust fund for the victims. 
Speedway officials said they planned to have a trust account opened 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident occurred in the last race of a three-year  
sanctioning agreement between the IRL and the speedway, prompting 
questions about whether the track might not seek to renew its 
agreement with the circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Further clouding the issue is the fact that the Charlotte track  
is owned by Speedway Motorsports Inc., which controls tracks that 
hold five of the 11 races on this year's IRL schedule. Should the 
IRL lose the support of SMI, it could spell serious trouble for the 
fledgling circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wheeler, who in addition to running the Charlotte track also  
serves as SMI's president, said the company remains committed to 
helping the IRL establish itself as a low-cost alternative to the 
Champ Car circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have pretty strong feelings about the IRL,'' he said.  
``They're trying to do the right thing.''

<HEADLINE> Elway Gets Towed Before Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- Forget about the famed fourth-quarter  
comebacks, the two Super Bowl rings and the sure induction to the 
NFL Hall of Fame. What John Elway really needed Saturday night was 
a parking pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway provided comic relief at his emotional retirement ceremony  
Sunday when he recounted having his car towed after dinner with 
several teammates in downtown Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sign didn't say `No parking.' It said, `Postal customers  
only,''' Elway recalled. ``It's 9 o'clock at night and there's 
other cars parked in there. I said, `This must be OK.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	``He came out and believe it or not, they towed his car -- the  
King's car,'' Broncos owner Pat Bowlen said. 
</P>
<P>
	As he has done so many times on the football field, Elway  
improvised. He found out that the towing company was near Coors 
Field a few miles away, and he set out to find a taxi. 
</P>
<P>
	``I start walking. If I run into a cab, I run into a cab,''  
Elway said. ``What do I run into? I run into six limos of high 
school students on their prom. Needless to say, I got to the tow 
lot. It was about a three-mile walk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The driver of the tow truck recognized his victim immediately.  
</P>
<P>
	``We figured it was a brand new car, we figured it was somebody  
with money, but we didn't think it was going to be you,'' the 
driver told Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman collecting the towing fee wasn't so impressed.  
</P>
<P>
	``When he got there, a lady said, `Can I see some ID, please?  
And I need $100 dollars,''' Bowlen said. ``Welcome to the world of 
the retired great quarterbacks, John.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Towing companies aside, Elway repeatedly thanked the fans of  
Denver and Colorado for their support during his 16-year career 
with the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	``Denver has been great. Colorado has been great to me and my  
family -- kind of took us under their wing,'' he said. ``We couldn't 
have asked for anything better.''

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Refugees Recount Day of Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLACE, Macedonia (AP) -- Ethnic Albanian refugees crossing the  
border Sunday recounted a day of slaughter in a central Kosovo 
village and said they were forced to dig graves for the decomposing 
bodies before being expelled from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses claim Serb forces killed at least 32 people in  
Slovinje. Their accounts, if confirmed, would rank it among the 
worst atrocities so far in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Death was all around us,'' said Nebahate Gashi, who claimed  
her husband, Omer, was among five people executed outside their 
home on April 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Accounts from nearly a dozen other refugees, a half-dozen of  
whom said they had witnessed mass killings, create a gruesome 
picture of what allegedly occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Masked militiamen, most with beards and long hair, entered the  
village near Lipljan, about 10 miles southeast of Pristina, the 
refugees said. Their uniforms were green, but no one could say with 
certainty whether they were a special military unit or a 
paramilitary squad. 
</P>
<P>
	People were ordered from their homes, the refugees said.  
Identity papers and other documents were destroyed and many homes 
in the village -- known in the Albanian language as Slovi -- were set 
on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people were lined up and shot at point-blank range, such as  
Omer Gashi and the four others, the refugees alleged. They said 
others were attacked with knives and at least one elderly woman was 
fatally burned. 
</P>
<P>
	Xhevat Gashi said a neighbor was hacked to death. He also  
claimed he saw a woman engulfed in flames who fell to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities later used construction equipment to make two mass  
graves of at least 16 bodies each, said Xhevat Gashi, a cousin of 
the widow. 
</P>
<P>
	Some refugees claimed the death toll was higher. They say Serbs  
also fired at people cowering in the forest outside the village of 
about 4,500 people. One villager, Agim Devshi, estimated at least 
45 people were killed overall. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, authorities exhumed the bodies from the graves and  
delivered them to family members, the refugees said. Armed police 
guards watched as families were forced to dig individual graves, 
they alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then we were told to leave at once,'' said Xhevat Gashi.  
</P>
<P>
	A U.N. refugee official said the reports are apparently part of  
a pattern of escalating Serb reprisals in areas near the Macedonian 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conflict appears definitely to be spreading,'' said Paula  
Ghedini, a spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees. ``We are hearing stories that could rival Racak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least 45 ethnic Albanians were slain outside Racak on Jan.  
15, increasing Western pressure on Yugoslavia to accept a peace 
plan for Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Reported attacks on ethnic Albanians in southern Kosovo have  
sharply increased the refugee tide into Macedonia, where camps are 
severely overcrowded and health officials worry about outbreaks of 
possible killer epidemics such as cholera. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 5,000 refugees passed through the main Blace border  
post Sunday and thousands others were expected to cross over 
mountains dotted with minefields. At least three refugees died last 
week after stepping on mines in the ill-defined border between 
Yugoslavia and Macedonia.

<HEADLINE> Japan Premier To Meet With Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Disputes over trade and the pace of Japan's  
economic reforms will be on the table when President Clinton meets 
Monday with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants Obuchi to pursue revitalizing Japan's economy  
swiftly, by any means necessary, in order to bring greater 
stability to the rest of Asia. Obuchi, who admits joblessness in 
Japan is likely to deepen, says he is doing all he can but that it 
will take time to reverse the worst recession Japan has experienced 
in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have boldly implemented every kind of measure aimed at  
achieving Japan's economic recovery,'' Obuchi said Saturday during 
a speech in Chicago, the second stop on his U.S. tour. ``At 
present, the United States is perfectly healthy and never catches a 
cold, but on the other hand, Japan has been ailing and losing its 
vigor for the last 10 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In spite of his efforts, Obuchi said, the rate of unemployment  
in Japan is 4.8 percent -- twice the rate to which Japan is 
accustomed -- and Japanese companies can be expected to cut more 
jobs, a sobering thought for workers in a land once proud of its 
promise of lifetime employment. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a figure we have to face squarely,'' Obuchi said. ``I  
am appealing for a reform of consciousness and efforts on the part 
of the entire nation ... Japan is capable of change and is, in 
fact, changing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi is making the first official U.S. visit of a Japanese  
prime minister in 12 years. He meets with Clinton Monday at the 
White House. He also will meet with American business leaders to 
tout Japan's economic recovery efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	He arrived in Washington on Sunday, after stops in Los Angeles  
and Chicago, where he threw the ceremonial first pitch at a Cubs 
baseball game. A joint news conference with Clinton and a White 
House dinner also are planned for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said Clinton would stress to Obuchi that  
although his reforms are showing some encouraging results, he must 
do more to open the Japanese market so that economic recovery will 
move faster. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japan has taken some constructive steps on banking and fiscal  
matters,'' said White House spokesman Jake Siewert. ``But it's 
important that they continue to implement those policies in a 
sustained way and do more to open and deregulate their economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taichi Sakaiya, Japan's minister of economic planning, said last  
week that Japan is content to ``achieve growth in a timely and 
flexible manner'' under the strategy Obuchi now is pursuing, ``and 
then see if anything else needs to be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials are worried that Japan cannot achieve the growth  
rate of 0.5 percent that Obuchi's government is predicting this 
year, since some Japanese and international forecasters say there 
will be negative growth well into next year. 
</P>
<P>
	They also note that Japan still lacks a plan for the economic  
recovery's second phase, several months after Obuchi took office 
and immediately began pumping billions of dollars into Japan's 
economy to try to end the recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Lael Brainard, deputy director of the National Economic Council,  
said Clinton has ``a strong interest'' in following up on Obuchi's 
recently stated commitment to removing the ``heavy shackles'' of 
regulation that are holding back foreign investment that can speed 
Japan's growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The terms of the debate in Japan appear to be changing,''  
Brainard said. ``There seems to be serious examination of opening 
the economy to foreign direct investment, of getting bureaucrats 
out of the business of managing industries. There seems to be a new 
seriousness about deregulation in services industries. We will be 
very interested to talk about specific actions in those areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Clinton administration expects to announce  
agreement on a series of measures to further deregulate the 
Japanese economy. U.S. officials also are trying to reach a broad 
market-opening package with China as part of China's bid to join 
the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also is expected to praise the passage of legislation by  
the Japanese parliament's lower house laying out guidelines for 
Japan's military alliance with the United States. The guidelines 
call for Japan to provide logistical support to the United States 
in the event of a military conflict in the region and, for the 
first time, establishes that Japan will help evacuate civilians and 
allow U.S. forces to use its airstrips and hospitals.

<HEADLINE> 7 Dead in Church Bus Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAYHILL, N.M. (AP) -- A camper being towed by a pickup truck  
broke loose Sunday and hit a bus and rammed into another pickup, 
killing six girls traveling home by bus from a church retreat and 
the driver of the second pickup, state police said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the pickup swerved, the camper broke loose and its fifth  
wheel, a device that mounts it to the pickup's bed, broke free and 
``tore along the side of bus,'' state police Capt. John Balderston 
said. It also struck the second pickup, which was behind the bus. 
</P>
<P>
	The mounting device ``just slid and just smashed into the bus,''  
said Julie Selleck, who works at Pine Springs Summer Camp. ``It's 
pretty devastating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The girls, ages 12 to 17, were killed instantly, Balderston  
said. There was no information available about the pickup driver 
who was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to those killed, three people were in critical  
condition, five were in serious condition and 19 were in stable 
condition at Alamogordo and Albuquerque hospitals, Selleck said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 people from Green Lawn Church of Christ in Lubbock,  
Texas, had been at the isolated, mountainous camp in the Lincoln 
National Forest for a weekend retreat, Selleck said. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the church group gathered after the accident at Cuba  
Avenue Church of Christ in Alamogordo. They were to take a bus 
provided by Holloman Air Force Base to another church in Artesia 
and home from there, church elder Jim Morrow said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a a lot of togetherness,'' Morrow said. ``We had a  
special prayer service tonight. It was emotional and intense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayhill is about 150 miles southeast of Albuquerque.

	MAYHILL, N.M. (AP) -- A spare tire apparently fell Sunday from a  
truck and smashed into a bus ferrying students from a church camp 
to their homes in Texas, killing seven people, state police said.

	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- An Arena Football League official was in  
critical condition Sunday after being hit by a player during a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Manning, who has officiated at AFL games for 13 years, was  
injured when Iowa's Mike Horacek apparently ran into him Saturday

been knocked to the ground. Spencer said when he landed, Manning 
already was unconscious.

<P>
	Barnstormers spokesman Dick McDonald said it wasn't known

<HEADLINE> Cuban Team Heads to Baltimore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cuba's national baseball team headed to  
Baltimore on Sunday, getting an airport send-off from Cuban leader 
Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	After sorting out visa problems that delayed the flight from  
Havana, the team boarded a charter about 5 p.m. EDT for its 
exhibition game with the Baltimore Orioles on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the delay meant the Cubans had to cancel their Sunday  
workout at Camden Yards and a reception in the team's honor. 
</P>
<P>
	The visa problems, concerning some in the delegation of more  
than 300, were resolved Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	This will mark the first time a Cuban team has played a major  
league team in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In the opener of this series, the Cubans beat the Orioles 3-2 in  
11 innings on March 28 in Havana. It was the first time in 40 years 
a major league team played in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	In the days leading to that game, the Orioles had to scramble to  
get their birth certificates, passports and visas in order. This 
time it was the Cubans who were tangled in red tape. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, the delay was thought to put Monday night's game  
in danger. But that is no longer the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles will be wearing their traditional black, orange and  
white for the rematch, but they'll be thinking red, white and blue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The important thing of every game is to win no matter what  
kind of uniform you wear or who you represent,'' Orioles pitcher 
Ricky Bones said Sunday. ``This time we're going to represent the 
United States. We should go out there with pride and try to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles have struggled mightily since beating Cuba in March.  
The team is in last place, the players are being booed at Camden 
Yards and manager Ray Miller might not have his job by the end of 
the 12-game homestand Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	So the Orioles can be forgiven if they don't regard the game  
with great anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, you'd like the club to have a day off,'' Miller  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's much the same attitude the Orioles carried into the first  
exhibition. But shortly after the playing of both country's 
national anthems, their attitude changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot more comes into it than just you or your team. Even  
though we weren't really representing the U.S., we were in a way,'' 
outfielder B.J. Surhoff said. ``We were one team but we were 
representing a whole lot of people. They looked at it as their 
national team representing them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Down there I knew it would be really intense and they'd be  
into it. I'm kind of curious to see how it's all going to play out 
tomorrow night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first game, many of Cuba's best players were unavailable  
because they were involved in the country's playoffs. There was no 
such obstacle this time, so the Orioles can expect even more 
competition in the rematch. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll have a better team this time. They'll have better  
players to choose from,'' said catcher Charles Johnson, whose 
two-run homer provided the majority of Baltimore's offense in the 
first game. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller hoped to rest his starters after six innings of that  
game, but the close score and high intensity caused him to stick 
with most of his stars for the entire contest. He will use his 
regular lineup Monday with the exception of his starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Kamieniecki, who is on the disabled list, will start for  
Baltimore. The Orioles can only hope the Cubans don't counter with 
Jose Contreras, who allowed two hits over eight shutout innings and 
struck out 10 in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
	While many of the Orioles consider the game a distraction, they  
realize the prestige associated with representing their country. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Twins manager Tom Kelly, whose team faced the Orioles  
on Sunday, wished he could be a part of the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd take it as an honor to manage and represent major league  
baseball in that endeavor,'' he said. ``I think I would really 
enjoy it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles merely want to make the best of the situation.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of pride taken over in Cuba. We did everything  
we could to win that game and I'm sure it will be no different over 
here,'' backup catcher Lenny Webster said. ``We hope to enjoy it, 
but at the same time we're going to try and beat them.''

<HEADLINE> WTO Deadlocked on Choice of Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The World Trade Organization on Sunday faced the  
prospect of a damaging leadership vacuum that could undermine its 
authority in global trade disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to appoint a new director-general ended in total  
deadlock after more than 12 hours of weekend meetings that 
degenerated into bad-tempered clashes between supporters of former 
New Zealand Premier Mike Moore and Thai Deputy Prime Minister 
Supachai Panitchpakdi. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali Mchumo, chairman of the 134-nation WTO council, reconvened a  
meeting of the decision-making body for Monday in hopes of finding 
a solution. 
</P>
<P>
	But prospects looked grim, with Asian and some African nations  
standing firm behind Supachai -- seen as the candidate of the 
developing world -- and the United States insisting on Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell described the atmosphere at  
Saturday's session as ``testy, tense and not terribly pleasant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The impasse and growing North-South split led to fears that a  
time-consuming hunt for a new leader might have to begin again from 
scratch despite the impressive track record of both current 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's Renato Ruggiero stepped down as scheduled on Friday  
after a four-year term in office, taking the WTO's deputy directors 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockwell said the WTO could continue to function without a  
leader, although it might pose some problems for the work of panels 
set up to adjudicate trade disputes. If parties involved in the 
trade rows can't agree on the composition of the three-member 
panels, the rules say that the director-general must name the 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	The Geneva-based body faces an upsurge in disputes following the  
U.S. announcement Friday that it will file complaints to the WTO 
against Europe, India, South Korea, Canada and Argentina for a 
variety of alleged unfair trade practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, the WTO needs a leader with global clout as it  
prepares for a November ministerial conference in Seattle, meant to 
set the trade agenda for the 21st century and usher in new 
agreements to liberalize global commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if there is agreement Monday on either Moore or Supachai,  
the successful candidate would face an uphill struggle in winning 
over all WTO members given the depth of bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
	WTO council chairman Mchumo, a Tanzanian diplomat, proposed on  
Friday that Moore be approved by consensus since he had the support 
of 62 nations, three more than Supachai. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Japan, Malaysia, India and other Asian nations demanded  
a vote. That ran counter to the WTO's time-honored rule that all 
decisions be reached by consensus. 
</P>
<P>
	Asian countries and their allies are particularly angry that the  
Thai candidate held a clear lead for months while the United States 
and Europe sat on the fence. Only when Washington opted in favor of 
Moore did the New Zealander begin to gain ground.

<HEADLINE> Buffett Criticizes High-Fee Brokers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Multibillionaire investor Warren Buffett on  
Sunday criticized for stockbrokers and investment managers who take 
high fees for their work. 
</P>
<P>
	Investment managers add nothing to the value of the businesses  
they trade stocks in, yet many demand 2 percent and 3 percent 
commissions and fees to help their clients invest, Buffett said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The average investment manager adds nothing,'' Buffett said.  
``He subtracts something from your investment performance. It's 
almost unique among professions that I can think of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Known for investing in companies he likes and holding the stock  
indefinitely, Buffett's estimated wealth of more than $29 billion 
makes him the second richest man in America behind Microsoft Corp. 
chairman Bill Gates, who has $58 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., invests in  
or owns businesses such as General Re and Geico insurance 
companies, Coca-Cola, Nebraska Furniture Mart, The Washington Post, 
International Dairy Queen and See's Candies. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference Sunday during Berkshire Hathaway's annual  
stockholders meeting, Buffett said people who want to invest in the 
stock market should learn about a business, trust its management 
and project earnings into the future. Then, he said, they should 
buy the stock and hold it. 
</P>
<P>
	People investing in mutual funds should make certain the fees  
charged are not too high, Buffett said, and give up hope that their 
investment will do anything better than average. 
</P>
<P>
	Another option is forming a pool of fellow investors who want to  
buy interests in the same companies, Buffett suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, Buffett also has criticized trading stocks in the  
same day for incremental gains, known as ``day-trading.'' saying 
the cost in commissions often outweigh any small gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffett's words are weighed heavily by many of his stockholders,  
about 15,000 of whom were expected at the three-day stockholders' 
extravaganza. 
</P>
<P>
	Many stockholders are with the company for life, and the price  
per share reflects that. Class A stock closed Friday at $76,400 a 
share, Class B stock at $2,470 a share.

<HEADLINE> 13 Dead in Arkansas Boat Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) -- An amphibious tourist boat that dragged  
13 people to their deaths had been in the shop for repair of a 
drive-shaft seal two days before, a federal official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The amphibious vehicle of World War II vintage -- called a  
``duck'' because it travels both on land and water -- sank rapidly 
shortly after entering Lake Hamilton on Saturday while passengers 
panicked and scrambled for life preservers. 
</P>
<P>
	The toll rose to 13 Sunday when a woman died in a hospital and  
divers returned to a lake and found her ex-husband's body. Their 
daughter also was among the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	National Transportation Safety Board member John A.  
Hammerschmidt also said investigators were focusing on a canopy 
over the boat that may have kept people from escaping. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-one people were on board, including the driver.  
</P>
<P>
	``The boat started taking on water and it started to tilt toward  
the back and went down in 15 seconds to 30 seconds,'' Garland 
County Sheriff Larry Selig said Sunday. He said it initially took 
on water over the stern. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand one man tried to pass out life jackets, but there  
was no time,'' Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
	The passengers had to get out through a gap between the sides of  
the boat's hull and the canvas canopy, and their efforts to put on 
life jackets -- which they were not required by law to be wearing -- 
may have contributed to the problem, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims included three children under the age of 5, Selig  
said, adding that the victims came from Tennessee, Louisiana and 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Divers had been sent home Saturday evening, their work  
apparently complete, but then authorities learned that one 
passenger was still unaccounted for when 15-year-old James Patton 
of Russellville viewed the victims' bodies and said he didn't see 
his father, Jim Patton, 48, Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patton's body was found Sunday morning about two hours after his  
ex-wife, Floy, died at St. Joseph's Regional Health Center, Selig 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Their daughter, Jennifer, 20, was among the victims, he said.  
Relatives said she was retarded and unable to swim, and that the 
Pattons had divorced and reconciled. 
</P>
<P>
	Hammerschmidt said he had interviewed the boat's driver,  
54-year-old Elizabeth Helmbrecht of Hot Springs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Helmbrecht had taken the boat back to company mechanics for  
repairs on Thursday, after a bilge pump turned on automatically, 
Hammerschmidt said. That indicated there was a hole in a seal 
around a drive shaft, Hammerschmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the boat is raised, inspectors plan to look at the seals on  
the boat to determine if they were functioning and if the repair 
was made. 
</P>
<P>
	Hammerschmidt said the driver told him that on Saturday she was  
about seven minutes out from shore when she realized the boat was 
taking on water. She said she tried to turn on the bilge pump, grab 
a radio, and turn back to shore, but the boat sank in less than a 
minute after she first knew there was a problem, Hammerschmidt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The duck, the Miss Majestic, is one of the amphibious vehicles  
that have rolled and floated through Hot Springs for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard asked both local companies that operate the  
vehicles to suspend operations until the sunken boat can be 
inspected. Efforts to raise the vessel probably won't be made until 
Monday, the sheriff said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ducks have three axles, six wheels and a propeller, and  
carry about 25 people, including the operator. They are inspected 
annually by the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	The duck that sank was owned by White &AMP; Yellow Duck Sightseeing  
Tours and operated by its subsidiary, Land and Lake Tours Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Bridges, who owns White &AMP; Yellow, said his boats are well  
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, sometimes, even when you do your best,  
accidents will happen,'' he said Saturday.

<HEADLINE> WTO Deadlocked on Choice of Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The World Trade Organization on Sunday faced the  
prospect of a damaging leadership vacuum that could undermine its 
authority in global trade disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to appoint a new director-general ended in total  
deadlock after more than 12 hours of weekend meetings that 
degenerated into bad-tempered clashes between supporters of former 
New Zealand Premier Mike Moore and Thai Deputy Prime Minister 
Supachai Panitchpakdi. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali Mchumo, chairman of the 134-nation WTO council, reconvened a  
meeting of the decision-making body for Monday in hopes of finding 
a solution. 
</P>
<P>
	But prospects looked grim, with Asian and some African nations  
standing firm behind Supachai -- seen as the candidate of the 
developing world -- and the United States insisting on Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell described the atmosphere at  
Saturday's session as ``testy, tense and not terribly pleasant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The impasse and growing North-South split led to fears that a  
time-consuming hunt for a new leader might have to begin again from 
scratch despite the impressive track record of both current 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's Renato Ruggiero stepped down as scheduled on Friday  
after a four-year term in office, taking the WTO's deputy directors 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The work of the organization is absolutely paralyzed at the  
moment,'' said Uruguay's ambassador Carlos Perez del Castillo. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the practical running of the organization, the  
WTO needs a leader with global clout as it prepares for a November 
ministerial conference in Seattle, meant to set the trade agenda 
for the 21st century and usher in new agreements to liberalize 
global commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are nearing a crisis,'' said U.S. ambassador Rita Hayes.  
``It is important we put this behind us and appoint a new 
director-general as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if there is agreement Monday on either Moore or Supachai,  
the successful candidate would face an uphill struggle in winning 
over all WTO members given the depth of bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
	WTO council chairman Ali Mchumo, a Tanzanian diplomat, proposed  
on Friday that Moore be approved by consensus since he had the 
support of 62 nations, three more than Supachai. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez del Castillo called on Supachai to bow out, saying that he  
would be unable to get a consensus even if Moore were vetoed. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Japan, Malaysia, India and other Asian nations favoring  
Supachai demanded a vote. That ran counter to the WTO's 
time-honored rule that all decisions be reached by consensus. 
</P>
<P>
	Asian countries and their allies are particularly angry that the  
Thai candidate held a clear lead for months while the United States 
and Europe sat on the fence. Only when Washington opted in favor of 
Moore did the New Zealander begin to gain ground.

<HEADLINE> IBM To Unveil Powerful Mainframe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM was expected to unveil Monday a new  
mainframe computer than can process 1.6 billion instructions per 
second, a machine designed help companies meet the crushing growth 
of online commerce and ensure IBM's place in an electronic economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The G6 is the first high-capacity business machine made by IBM  
to use the copper-semiconductor technology that the company 
introduced nearly two years ago. In addition to increasing speed 
and capacity, copper chips cost less and use less electricity than 
those made with aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
	The product launch comes at least a month ahead of schedule and  
the jump in performance capacity is much larger than expected. The 
new machines were introduced less than nine months after IBM put 
out the first mainframe to break the 1 billion mark for 
instructions per second. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were not expected to hit these levels until the middle of  
next year. It's really quite a surprise,'' said John Jones, an 
industry analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	That type of power, he said, could help online retailers, Web  
brokerages and other frequently overwhelmed e-businesses better 
``handle the transaction volume growth that's being created by the 
explosion of demand coming from the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The G6, so named because it's the sixth generation of IBM  
mainframes based on an industry format known as S/390, is clearly 
designed with an eye toward the furious, system-clogging pace of 
growth in the everyday use and uses of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	But IBM remains most determined to dominate the market for  
electronic commerce between companies, an even faster growing part 
of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the explosive growth of holiday shopping over the  
Internet last year created many headlines, business-to-business 
e-commerce far outpaces consumer spending,'' IBM said in a separate 
press release announcing plans for a new center to help companies 
develop systems for processing electronic transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement noted forecasts from Forrester Research Inc.  
that business-to-business transactions could grow to $1.3 trillion 
worth over the next four years, up from $43 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	No exact pricing for the new G6 line was disclosed, but in  
trying to stake a claim in such a lucrative, but rapidly evolving 
market, IBM faces many of the same competitive pressures as any 
Internet start-up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the trends in last two years and the competitive  
situation that they have with the Hitachi Skyline product, I would 
expect that they will continue to price this machine 
aggressively,'' said Jones, suggesting that IBM might hold prices 
steady with those charged for the G5 mainframes currently on the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitachi, which has lost considerable market share since IBM  
introduced the G5, is expected to release the next generation of 
its Skyline mainframe later this year which will be able handle 
roughly 2 billion instructions per second. 
</P>
<P>
	At present, the cheapest G5 mainframe may sell for between  
$600,000 and $900,000, while ``full-blown'' machines may cost 
nearly 10 times that amount, said Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	If the same pricing schedule was established for the G6,  
customers would be paying for processing power at a rate of $2,700 
for every ``million instructions per second,'' or MIPS, the most 
common yardstick for measuring mainframe capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	That would represent a drop of 33 percent from the $4,000 per  
MIP that G5 customers have been paying. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, strong demand for the powerful new mainframe could  
provide a boost to IBM's financial performance. The company plans 
to begin shipping the G6 in late May, early enough to have an 
impact on the current quarter's results. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they can get any kind of volume out this quarter, it looks  
like it would have a positive impact on their revenue growth in 
this segment in the business,'' said Jones, noting that while IBM 
holds 82 percent of the S/390 market, mainframes account for just 6 
percent or 7 percent of IBM's sales.

<HEADLINE> Climbers Say Body Found on Everest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Members of an expedition seeking to determine  
whether Englishmen George Mallory and Andrew Irvine were the first 
to reach the summit of Mount Everest say they have located 
Mallory's body near the top of the world's highest peak. 
</P>
<P>
	``They found a name tag sewn into his clothing,'' said Peter  
Potterfield, editor of mountainzone.com, a Seattle-based Internet 
company relaying dispatches from the climbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight climbers have been looking for the bodies of the men -- who  
disappeared in 1924 -- and a camera that could contain pictures 
proving they reached the summit 29 years before Sir Edmund Hillary 
and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay. 
</P>
<P>
	They found the body Saturday but haven't yet found the camera or  
evidence to prove they had reached the summit, Potterfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	The expedition is being documented by the Boston-based public  
television show NOVA, and is sponsored by PBS and Potterfield's 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Expedition leader Eric Simonson and fellow climber Dave Hahn,  
who was the first to come across the body, described their 
excitement over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``And so when we realized that it was George Mallory, we were  
really blown away by that,'' Hahn said. ``We didn't want to disturb 
him, he'd been lying there for 75 years, but at the same time we 
thought what better tribute to the man than to try and find out if 
he had summitted Mt. Everest in 1924.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The body was found about 2,000 feet from the windblown  
29,028-foot summit not far from that of a Chinese climber, whose 
accounts were used by the NOVA crew to try to locate Mallory and 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
	Jochen Hemmleb, a 28-year-old German climber and Mallory  
historian, chose a location for the team to search based largely on 
a report from the climber, Wang Hongbao, of a body on the North 
Ridge route Mallory and Irvine would have taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Hongbao described the body as ``English Dead,'' and indicated  
its vintage clothing broke to pieces when he touched it. 
</P>
<P>
	The body was found on a snow terrace, just below the spot where  
an ice ax believed to be Irvine's was found in 1933. The ax had 
three notches on the handle, which was how Irvine marked his 
equipment. Two days after Hongbao told his story in 1975, he died 
in an avalanche on Everest's North Face. 
</P>
<P>
	The climb, which began on March 29, is being made in six stages.  
The mountaineers establish camps at ever higher altitudes, and then 
descend to base camp as they become acclimated to the thin air. 
</P>
<P>
	High winds combined with low precipitation have scoured the  
mountain clean, helping the expedition.

<HEADLINE>  Grissom's Mercury Capsule Located </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Thirty-eight years after it vanished  
into the Atlantic Ocean, the Mercury space capsule flown by 
astronaut Gus Grissom has been found -- in amazingly good condition, 
considering where it is. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty Bell 7 -- the only U.S. manned spacecraft ever lost  
following a successful mission -- was discovered Saturday 300 miles 
southeast of Cape Canaveral, three miles beneath the surface of the 
Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Salvagers will have to wait several more weeks, however, before  
they can exhume it. The underwater robotic rover that was used to 
identify and photograph the spacecraft sank in rough seas Saturday, 
putting recovery efforts on hold until a new vessel can be 
obtained. 
</P>
<P>
	Expedition leader Curt Newport said on his way back to port  
Sunday that he went from an emotional high when the capsule was 
located to an emotional low when the recovery vessel sank, all in a 
matter of hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't think of a more perfect example of triumph and  
tragedy,'' he said in a ship-to-shore news conference arranged by 
the Discovery Channel, which is funding the mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Before its tether snapped, the remotely operated submersible  
sent back haunting video of the capsule. 
</P>
<P>
	Still shiny in spots, the spacecraft is propped upright on a  
sandy knoll, its window and parachute liner still intact and its 
periscope still extended. The words ``United States'' and ``Liberty 
Bell'' are plainly visible. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport said he also could see the fake crack that was painted  
on the exterior of Liberty Bell 7 to replicate its namesake, as 
well as the singe marks left by the explosives that blew out the 
hatch following splashdown on July 21, 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosives detonated too soon, and the spacecraft took on so  
much water that helicopter rescuers could not lift it from the sea. 
Grissom nearly drowned, but was pulled to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The mishap forever marred Grissom's otherwise successful  
15-minute suborbital flight, which was the nation's second manned 
space shot. The astronaut, who went on to fly in Gemini, insisted 
until his death in the 1967 Apollo launch pad fire that he'd done 
nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Some wondered at the time -- and still do -- whether Grissom  
bumped something or even panicked. 
</P>
<P>
	His widow, Betty Grissom, feels certain the hatch malfunctioned.  
In any case, she wishes the capsule was never found. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Grissom said last month that she resents not being  
consulted from the start about the salvage effort and doesn't want 
the capsule to be restored at the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space 
Center, as is the plan. That's where the capsule eventually will be 
put on display under an agreement with NASA and the Smithsonian 
Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding Grissom's capsule wasn't easy.  
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after setting sail on April 19, Newport and his team  
struggled with a broken sonar. Once fixed, it uncovered 88 
potential targets in a 24-square-mile area that Newport had 
pinpointed based on 14 years of analyzing NASA charts and 
photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	The first target they looked at with the camera-equipped rover  
turned out to be Liberty Bell 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport said the team followed the decomposed pieces of the  
capsule's heat shield up a hill. The trail of debris led them to 
the 7-foot titanium and aluminum capsule. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, Newport thought the dark, tall, conical object was  
airplane wreckage. He was stunned when he saw the words ``United 
States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember saying, 'Oh my God, I can't believe it. That's it.  
We found it. This is it!''' he said. ``There was a lot of shaking 
hands and slapping each other on the back and just congratulating 
each other and just staring in disbelief at this spacecraft in 
front of us, us being the first ones to see it since 1961.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newport, 47, a former space station worker, had made two  
previous attempts to find the capsule in the early 1990s, but did 
not have sophisticated enough equipment or enough time to 
accomplish the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a very difficult thing to find,'' he said. ``You have  
to understand, what we did was find something in water half a mile 
deeper than the Titanic and it's smaller than one of the Titanic's 
boilers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two cameras and a tape recorder that sank with the capsule could  
shed light on why the hatch blew open too soon -- one of the biggest 
mysteries of American space flight. But it's doubtful the film can 
be salvaged after so long underwater. 
</P>
<P>
	The hatch would hold the answer. Newport estimates it could be  
as much as a mile from Liberty Bell 7; he plans to spend a day 
looking for it when he returns for the capsule and the sunken 
rover. 
</P>
<P>
	If the capsule was tough to find, the hatch will be that much  
tougher. But Newport can't resist trying.

</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Oliver Reed, the feisty, hard-drinking actor who  
was as well known for his antics off screen as he was for his 
performances on screen, died Sunday in Malta. He was 61. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed, who played the fearsome Bill Sikes in the 1968 musical  
``Oliver!'', died on the way to a hospital after taking ill while 
drinking with friends in a bar in the Maltese capital, Valetta, 
police said. The cause of death was not immediately disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed was on the Mediterranean island filming a new movie, ``The  
Gladiator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His 53 films include ``Women in Love,'' ``The Devils,'' and  
``Tommy,'' all directed by the eccentric Englishman Ken Russell. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike some stars who need elaborate explication of their roles,  
Reed was content, Russell said, to create his own shorthand as a 
way of understanding his character: ``moody one, moody two, or 
moody three ... depending on the intensity of the smoldering 
meanness required.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Reed was often better-known for misdeeds away from the  
camera and well-publicized drinking bouts.

 *Roderick Thorp    	
</P>
<P>
	OXNARD, Calif. (AP) -- Roderick Thorp, a master of suspense  
fiction whose best-selling novels ``Die Hard'' and ``The 
Detective'' became popular movies, died Wednesday of a heart 
attack. He was 62. 
</P>
<P>
	Thorp's career spanned more than three decades. Born in New York  
City on Sept. 1, 1936, he won prizes for short-story writing while 
attending City College of New York but was unable to find success 
as an author after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he went to work in his father's private detective  
business. Over nine years, he gathered knowledge that stood him in 
good stead in his writing career. 
</P>
<P>
	Success as an author came with his 1966 book ``The Detective.''  
It sold millions of copies worldwide and was turned into a movie 
starring Frank Sinatra and Lee Remick. 
</P>
<P>
	He taught literature at Ramapo College in Mahwah, N.J., then  
moved to Los Angeles in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	His 1979 detective novel ``Nothing Lasts Forever'' was renamed  
``Die Hard'' in its second edition, which later became a 1988 hit 
movie starring Bruce Willis. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his later books was 1995's well-reviewed ``River: A Novel  
of the Green River Killings.'' It was a fictionalized account of an 
unsolved series of murders that occurred in the 1980s in the 
Pacific Northwest.

<HEADLINE>  Grissom's Mercury Capsule Located </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Thirty-eight years after it vanished  
into the Atlantic Ocean, the Mercury space capsule flown by 
astronaut Gus Grissom has been found -- in amazingly good condition, 
considering where it is. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty Bell 7 -- the only U.S. manned spacecraft ever lost  
following a successful mission -- was discovered Saturday 300 miles 
southeast of Cape Canaveral, three miles beneath the surface of the 
Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Salvagers will have to wait several more weeks, however, before  
they can exhume it. The underwater robotic rover that was used to 
identify and photograph the spacecraft sank in rough seas Saturday, 
putting recovery efforts on hold until a new vessel can be 
obtained. 
</P>
<P>
	Expedition leader Curt Newport said on his way back to port  
Sunday that he went from an emotional high when the capsule was 
located to an emotional low when the recovery vessel sank, all in a 
matter of hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't think of a more perfect example of triumph and  
tragedy,'' he said in a ship-to-shore news conference arranged by 
the Discovery Channel, which is funding the mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Before its tether snapped, the remotely operated submersible  
sent back haunting video of the capsule. 
</P>
<P>
	Still shiny in spots, the spacecraft is propped upright on a  
sandy knoll, its window and parachute liner still intact and its 
periscope still extended. The words ``United States'' and ``Liberty 
Bell'' are plainly visible. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport said he also could see the fake crack that was painted  
on the exterior of Liberty Bell 7 to replicate its namesake, as 
well as the singe marks left by the explosives that blew out the 
hatch following splashdown on July 21, 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosives detonated too soon, and the spacecraft took on so  
much water that helicopter rescuers could not lift it from the sea. 
Grissom nearly drowned, but was pulled to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The mishap forever marred Grissom's otherwise successful  
15-minute suborbital flight, which was the nation's second manned 
space shot. The astronaut, who went on to fly in Gemini, insisted 
until his death in the 1967 Apollo launch pad fire that he'd done 
nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Some wondered at the time -- and still do -- whether Grissom  
bumped something or even panicked. 
</P>
<P>
	His widow, Betty Grissom, feels certain the hatch malfunctioned.  
In any case, she wishes the capsule was never found. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Grissom said last month that she resents not being  
consulted from the start about the salvage effort and doesn't want 
the capsule to be restored at the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space 
Center, as is the plan. That's where the capsule eventually will be 
put on display under an agreement with NASA and the Smithsonian 
Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding Grissom's capsule wasn't easy.  
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after setting sail on April 19, Newport and his team  
struggled with a broken sonar. Once fixed, it uncovered 88 
potential targets in a 24-square-mile area that Newport had 
pinpointed based on 14 years of analyzing NASA charts and 
photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	The first target they looked at with the camera-equipped rover  
turned out to be Liberty Bell 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport said the team followed the decomposed pieces of the  
capsule's heat shield up a hill. The trail of debris led them to 
the 7-foot titanium and aluminum capsule. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, Newport thought the dark, tall, conical object was  
airplane wreckage. He was stunned when he saw the words ``United 
States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember saying, 'Oh my God, I can't believe it. That's it.  
We found it. This is it!''' he said. ``There was a lot of shaking 
hands and slapping each other on the back and just congratulating 
each other and just staring in disbelief at this spacecraft in 
front of us, us being the first ones to see it since 1961.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newport, 47, a former space station worker, had made two  
previous attempts to find the capsule in the early 1990s, but did 
not have sophisticated enough equipment or enough time to 
accomplish the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a very difficult thing to find,'' he said. ``You have  
to understand, what we did was find something in water half a mile 
deeper than the Titanic and it's smaller than one of the Titanic's 
boilers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two cameras and a tape recorder that sank with the capsule could  
shed light on why the hatch blew open too soon -- one of the biggest 
mysteries of American space flight. But it's doubtful the film can 
be salvaged after so long underwater. 
</P>
<P>
	The hatch would hold the answer. Newport estimates it could be  
as much as a mile from Liberty Bell 7; he plans to spend a day 
looking for it when he returns for the capsule and the sunken 
rover. 
</P>
<P>
	If the capsule was tough to find, the hatch will be that much  
tougher. But Newport can't resist trying.

<HEADLINE> E-Commerce Alive, Well at ND Ranch / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRANVILLE, N.D. (AP) -- At the Big Sky Buffalo Ranch, checking  
the Internet for meat orders is on the list of daily chores, along 
with tending the herd of 350 bison that roam vast pastures in 
north-central North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Big Sky sells its buffalo meat to customers all over the world  
via the Internet, providing a financial boost while many farmers 
and ranchers are struggling to stay on the land. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to find other avenues to bring money into North  
Dakota,'' Cathy Ulland said as she drove by herds of buffalo on her 
family's pasture. ``We know we don't have much in North Dakota.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ulland's father, Duane Woodall, started Big Sky in 1982 with  
five head of buffalo. It was a hobby, something to supplement his 
farm and ranch income. But bison ranching has become big business 
in recent years, while traditional farming and ranching has hit 
hard times because of bad weather and low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Big Sky started to focus on bison -- and the Internet -- as an  
alternative. Ulland said the ranch sells about the same amount of 
buffalo meat by computer as it does at its small store in downtown 
Granville, also known as McGillicuddy City. 
</P>
<P>
	The ranch started selling online four years ago, and it has  
bolstered sales every year. Big Sky ships buffalo meat to every 
state, and it sells buffalo jerky strips worldwide from Granville, 
population 400. 
</P>
<P>
	``Granville or New York City, it doesn't matter. We're on an  
even playing ground there,'' said Sue Blikre, Internet office 
coordinator for the Minot-based Central North American Trade 
Corridor Association. The business promotion group creates World 
Wide Web pages for companies and cities throughout North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Big Sky customers can fill out an order form on the ranch's Web  
site and have the meat shipped the next day in a special container 
to keep it cool. Buffalo meat is more expensive than regular beef, 
but the product is leaner and lower in fat and cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all North Dakotans like the higher-priced meat, but that  
doesn't matter for people elsewhere who are willing to pay more for 
a delicacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before they would have to depend on the local market with  
people buying buffalo. Some of us can't afford buffalo, but the 
people on the East Coast sure can,'' Blikre said. ``They've made a 
lot of sales all over the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Big Sky is the only North Dakota ranch to sell bison meat on the  
Internet, Ulland said. The North American Bison Cooperative 
processing plant in New Rockford has an informational Internet 
site, offering recipe and menu ideas for the food service industry, 
said Chad Bullinger, marketing manager for the co-op. 
</P>
<P>
	Big Sky is one of 330 ranches throughout the region that belong  
to the cooperative. Ulland expects more ranchers to use the 
Internet to help stay on their land. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you're going to see a lot more farmers doing what  
we're doing,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Hospital Execs Face Fraud Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Four executives of Columbia/HCA Healthcare  
Corp., the nation's largest hospital chain, tried to cheat 
government health care programs by overbilling for services, then 
trying to cover up the inflated costs, the government says. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection begins Monday in the federal lawsuit alleging the  
defendants, all mid-level managers at Columbia, plotted to defraud 
the government of $2.8 million by submitting false Medicare, 
CHAMPUS and Medicaid claims to get higher reimbursements. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare is a government health care program for the elderly and  
frail, Medicaid is government health care for the poor and CHAMPUS 
is a civilian health insurance program for the military. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Susan Bucklew expected to choose from a pool  
of 50 prospective jurors, more than the usual number since the 
trial is projected to last two months. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors allege that the defendants claimed certain expenses  
at Fawcett Memorial Hospital in Port Charlotte, Fla., were 
``capital outlays'' when they knew some charges should have been 
listed as administrative and general expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The government reimburses capital outlays at a higher rate than  
administrative expenses. The claims brought in $2.8 million, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The executives were accused of misleading Columbia's lawyers,  
setting up a reserve bank account to pay back the money if the 
disguised claims were exposed and trying to come up with ways to 
throw an auditor off track -- even if it meant offering the auditor 
a job. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges were the first to come out of a sweeping government  
probe of the giant Nashville-based hospital chain, which took in 
$18.7 billion in revenue in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Named as defendants in an indictment handed up June 25, 1997,  
were Robert Whiteside of Brentwood, Tenn., a senior executive in 
the reimbursement department; Jay Jarrell of Fort Myers, chief 
executive officer of the southwest Florida division and Michael 
Neeb of Jacksonville, chief financial officer of Columbia's 
northern Florida operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In July 1998, a superseding seven-count indictment expanded  
allegations against the three executives and added as a defendant 
Carl Lynn Dick of Orlando, chief financial officer at Columbia's 
central Florida division. He was charged with conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Whiteside, Jarrell and Neeb are charged with conspiracy to  
defraud, making false statements and planning to deceive or 
obstruct a federal auditor. 
</P>
<P>
	Each count carries a penalty of up to five years in prison and a  
maximum fine of $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	An affidavit unsealed in October 1997 showed prosecutors  
believed the Columbia executives tried to cover up a wide-ranging 
fraud scheme by: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Adding blood tests and other tests that either were not  
ordered or not necessary; 
</P>
<P>
	-- Labeling questionable files such as internal audits  
``attorney-client privilege'' to hide results; 
</P>
<P>
	-- Establishing reserve funds to repay Medicare if caught.

<HEADLINE> Heston: Gun Laws Not the Answer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government should do a better job  
of sending gun violators to prison rather than coming up with new 
gun control laws, National Rifle Association President Charlton 
Heston says. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics who link the school shootings in Littleton, Colo., to  
the NRA's success in stopping new gun restrictions should look 
instead to the government's failure to enforce the 2,000 gun laws 
already on the books, Heston said Sunday on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder, appearing on the same show,  
said laws enacted during the Clinton administration have kept 
firearms out of the hands of criminals and contributed to a drop in 
gun violence without imposing on the rights of law-abiding 
citizens. ``How has the universe changed for people who have a 
legitimate right to have a gun?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	A scaled-back NRA convention in Denver on Saturday drew 8,000  
protesters, many saying the NRA's hardline opposition to gun 
control was one reason the two youths who killed 12 of their fellow 
students and a teacher in suburban Littleton, Colo., had such easy 
access to powerful firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is not the availability of arms,'' but the  
government's poor record in prosecuting both juveniles and adults 
for gun violations, Heston said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the NRA did support trigger locks, didn't oppose bans on  
some ammunition clips and favored instant criminal checks on buyers 
at gun shows, as long as files were not kept on American citizens. 
``That smells of tyranny,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the veteran film actor opposed an administration proposal to  
extend the waiting period for background checks under the Brady law 
to prevent felons from buying handguns. ``I'm not interested in 
seeing them denied purchase,'' he said. ``I'm interested in seeing 
them imprisoned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heston said that if invited, he would attend a proposed White  
House summit on juvenile violence. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, seizing the initiative as the nation recoiled  
from the Colorado shootings, last week introduced a broad 
gun-control measure that would raise the legal age for handgun 
possession from 18 to 21, hold negligent parents liable, halt 
imports of all high-capacity ammunition clips and limit handgun 
purchases to one a month. 
</P>
<P>
	His bill also would require child-safety locks on all guns sold,  
impose background checks on buyers for all gun-show sales and 
require a three-day waiting period for all handgun purchases. 
Today, most checks to verify a would-be purchaser doesn't have a 
criminal record are done instantaneously. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the  
Republican-led Congress was willing to look at steps to tighten 
existing laws, but he agreed with Heston that the real need was for 
more aggressive prosecution. The two suspects in Littleton broke at 
least 17 laws in their assault, Lott said on CNN's ``Late 
Edition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, interviewed on  
``Fox News Sunday,'' said that since Clinton took office gun 
violation prosecutions have been cut in half. ``This administration 
hasn't been very serious about guns,'' the Utah Republican said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a leading advocate of gun control,  
praised the Clinton package but acknowledged that enacting even 
modest new laws will be tough. One survey found that only 4 percent 
of Americans think new gun control laws aren't needed, he said, and 
``I think that 4 percent is all in the Congress.''

<HEADLINE> 7 Dead in Church Bus Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAYHILL, N.M. (AP) -- A spare tire apparently fell from a truck  
Sunday and smashed into a bus carrying students from a church camp 
to their homes in Texas, killing seven people, state police said. 
Six of the dead were girls from the church camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty devastating,'' said Julie Selleck, who works at  
Pine Springs Summer Camp. 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 people from Green Lawn Church of Christ in Lubbock,  
Texas, had been at the isolated, mountainous camp in the Lincoln 
National Forest for a weekend retreat, Selleck said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2 p.m. crash on U.S. 82 reportedly involved a semi-trailer,  
a motor home and the church bus, but that could not be confirmed, 
state police spokesman Robert Smoot said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to those killed, three people was in critical  
condition, five were in serious condition and 19 were in stable 
condition at hospitals in Alamogordo and Albuquerque, Selleck said. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Green Lawn church group gathered after the  
accident at Cuba Avenue Church of Christ in Alamogordo. They were 
to take a bus provided by Holloman Air Force Base to another church 
in Artesia and home from there, church elder Jim Morrow said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a a lot of togetherness,'' Morrow said. ``We had a  
special prayer service tonight. It was emotional and intense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayhill is about 150 miles southeast of Albuquerque.

<HEADLINE> Tigers Pitcher Caught With Sandpaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Larry Rothschild didn't feel like a  
good detective who solved a horrible crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tampa Bay manager carefully plotted strategy to prove  
Detroit pitcher Brian Moehler was defacing the ball Saturday night. 
However, he insisted he didn't get any pleasure out of nabbing the 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Moehler was ejected during the seventh inning of the Tigers' 4-3  
loss to the Devil Rays for having a small piece of sandpaper 
attached to his left thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe in the rule book -- and I may be wrong -- that's a  
10-day suspension,'' said umpire Larry Barnett, who described 
Moehler's reaction as that of a kid caught with his hand in the 
cookie jar. ``It's not my decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Section 3.02 of the Official Baseball Rules calls for a 10-day  
suspension. In 1987, Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Kevin Gross was 
suspended for 10 days by NL president A. Bartlett Giamatti after 
Gross was caught with sandpaper in his glove. That same year, AL 
president Bobby Brown suspended Minnesota pitcher Joe Niekro for 10 
days for carrying an emery board and sandpaper in his back pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision by AL president Gene Budig is expected Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Moehler denied scuffing the ball or having sandpaper on his  
thumb when Rothschild asked Barnett to check the pitcher's glove 
and hands after Moehler allowed consecutive singles with one out in 
the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he didn't protest the ejection because it's not his  
nature to argue and that Barnett was just doing his job. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was nothing there. It was dirt,'' Moehler said. ``I  
don't know if other guys do it or not, but I was rubbing the ball 
like I always do. These three fingers get the dirtiest, but the ump 
said he saw something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays became suspicious after Moehler, who allowed  
three runs in the first two innings, suddenly began getting sharper 
than usual movement on some of his pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	He asked his bat boys to start collecting balls tossed out of  
play in the fourth inning. He took his case to Barnett at the 
beginning of the seventh, but waited until the Devil Rays had the 
go-ahead run in scoring position before asking the umpire to check 
Moehler. 
</P>
<P>
	``My third time up that ball cut inside a good foot,'' said  
outfielder Dave Martinez, who drove in Tampa Bay's first run with a 
first-inning triple. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went from seeing the ball and thinking I was going to smoke  
it up the middle to almost getting jammed and flying out to left. 
All of a sudden the ball's coming in on you like that, darting in 
on you, and you're thinking: `If he doesn't throw a cutter, what's 
he throwing?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Rothschild said he only went to Barnett after he was fairly  
certain the umpire would find something. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't check for gamesmanship. I checked because there was  
something going on. I don't play that game,'' the manager said. ``I 
did it because I knew that something was going on. I wouldn't do it 
to distract somebody or anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Moehler, Detroit manager Larry Parrish didn't protest the  
ejection. But Parrish did take issue with Rothschild asking the 
umpire to look at the pitcher's glove and hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a pitching staff in baseball that doesn't have a  
guy who defaces the ball ... If the umpires want to check things 
like that, I think half to three-quarters of the league would be 
suspended, including Tampa Bay Devil Rays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked for names, Parrish tabbed Devil Rays starter Bobby Witt  
and closer Roberto Hernandez as culprits. Witt was the winning 
pitcher, while Hernandez earned his 200th career save Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not a cheater,'' Hernandez said. ``I'm sorry, I'm not  
about that. If he has to say that I cheat he's just putting a 
little more doubt in his hitters' minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rothschild conceded that catching Moehler is not likely to  
change the way pitchers go about their business. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can know about it. But a lot of times there's nothing you  
can do about it ... There are guys who are pretty good at it, and 
you're not going to be able to find anything. That goes on all the 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rothschild added, however, it would have been unfair to his  
players to have known Moehler was doing something and not gone to 
Barnett. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't derive any satisfaction out of getting somebody thrown  
out of the game,'' Rothschild said. ``But I'm going to stand up for 
what these players need, and that's a level playing field.''

<HEADLINE> Star Wars: May the Toys Be With You </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Force is with ``Star Wars'' fans, and it's  
telling them to hit the toy stores early and spend, spend, spend. 
</P>
<P>
	The most-hyped line of movie-themed merchandise in history -- for  
the still unreleased ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' 
-- is finally going on sale on a studio-imposed schedule, and fans 
and retailers aren't wasting a minute. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unprecedented move, Toys R Us stores around the country  
decided to open their doors at 12:01 a.m. Monday for an all-night 
selling marathon of toys based on the movie. Some FAO Schwarz 
stores planned to open from midnight to 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart and Kmart called in extra staff for their 24-hour  
stores to handle the post-midnight crowds. Many stores planned to 
limit the number of items a customer could buy to prevent immediate 
sell-outs. 
</P>
<P>
	By 6 p.m. EDT, some fans were already lining up to get first  
dibs on the new merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been getting lots of phone calls and there are already  
people out there,'' said Randy Perkins, a manager at the Wal-Mart 
store in Rome, N.Y. ``We expect this to be a busy night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the virtual stores were ready for middle-of-the-night  
surfers with an itch to buy. Internet merchants Amazon.com and 
eToys planned to open their online ``Star Wars'' stores just after 
midnight.

<P>
	Fans had been waiting for months to get a glimpse of the vast  
array of goods -- from action figures to wigs to body lotion to 
snack food -- tied to the movie, which opens May 19. 
</P>
<P>
	But LucasFilm Ltd. had signed strict licensing deals that  
prevented manufacturers from releasing virtually any information 
about their products ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, people had been speculating for months, especially  
on the Internet, about what the toys and other merchandise would 
be. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, people are just frothing at the mouth,'' said Omaha  
resident Dean Phillips, a ``Star Wars'' merchandise collector. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Van Pelt had already figured out that he'd spend about $150  
at Toys R Us on Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have gone online, gotten a list of things that's expected to  
come out, so I have an idea of what I'm getting,'' said Van Pelt of 
Concord, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	Die-hard fans who turned out for a Star Wars convention in  
Denver on Friday got a sneak-peek at some of the merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	There were eight basic action figures, which are 3 3/4 inches tall,  
including the Jedi knight Obi-Wan Kenobi as a young man; Anakin 
Skywalker, the father of Luke Skywalker and the man who later 
became Darth Vader; Jar Jar Binks, a new space creature; and Queen 
Amidala, the leader of the ``good'' side. 
</P>
<P>
	The action figures retail for $7 to $8, while related computer  
gear to make them talk costs an additional $20 to $25. 
</P>
<P>
	A collection of Queen Amidala fashion dolls also was introduced.  
And there was a 3-D diorama that recreates memorable movie scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts estimate that sales of merchandise tied to the movie  
could top $2 billion this year alone, with an estimated $1 billion 
coming just from toys. 
</P>
<P>
	Many stores kept the ``Star Wars'' merchandise locked up until  
late Sunday, when they began stocking shelves. At some stores, 
managers were not even permitted to see the merchandise until the 
last minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Some stores created a party atmosphere for the late-night  
crowds. At a Toys R Us in southeast Oklahoma City, there was a 
costume contest as well as a tent set up where they could watch the 
first ``Star Wars'' movies. In Omaha, the Toys R Us served cakes in 
the shape of ``Star Wars'' characters.

<HEADLINE> Mets Celebrate 1969 Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Mets were not willing to compare  
World Series championships Sunday as they celebrated the 30th 
anniversary of their first title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't play that game of one era is '69 and another era is  
'86,'' said Bud Harrelson, who played for the 1969 team and coached 
the 1986 club. ``They were both great teams. The difference is that 
the '86 Mets went from wire to wire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrelson, a scrappy, light-hitting shortstop, was an integral  
part of the '69 World Series champs, who defeated the seemingly 
unbeatable Baltimore Orioles in five games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't expected to win, which made it phenomenal and  
special,'' Harrelson said before the Mets' old-timers beat a team 
of former big league stars 7-0. ``We were America's team. We were 
loved by everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrelson coached third base for the 1986 champions, who coasted  
to a franchise-best 108 wins, but had to struggle through a 
pressure-packed NL championship series against Houston and an even 
more dramatic World Series against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Current Mets bench coach Bruce Benedict was in the dugout during  
the old-timers' game and listened to ex-Mets tell stories about the 
'69 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They weren't expected to win, but they were a wonderful  
defensive team,'' Benedict said. ``They had outstanding pitching 
and they got hot at the right time. They got hot at the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benedict, a catcher for the Atlanta Braves in 1986, remembered  
the '86 Mets as a talented, close-knit group. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did things for you on an everyday basis,'' Benedict said.  
``You have to have a little luck involved too. I think a lot of 
things have to fall together for you. I think the Mets had all 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mets closer John Franco, honored Saturday for becoming the  
second player to save 400 games, was impressed with the ability of 
the '69 Mets to beat an Orioles team that included future Hall of 
Famers Brooks Robinson, Frank Robinson and Jim Palmer. And this 
after a ninth-place finish in 1968 that matched the Mets' best. 
</P>
<P>
	``They won the whole thing,'' Franco said. ``Nobody expected  
them to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franco was the Cincinnati Reds' closer in 1986 and faced a  
feared New York lineup which included Keith Hernandez, Gary Carter 
and Darryl Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were true professionals. They did the little things to  
win ballgames, got runners over and had a solid lineup. They were 
just a tough team to pitch to.''

<P>
	THE WOODLANDS, Texas (AP) -- Golfer Steve Elkington, in  
contention for a victory Sunday at the Houston Open, had to 
withdraw from the tournament and required hospitalization after 
suffering severe migraines, PGA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elkington, 36, an Australian who attended the University of  
Houston and now lives in Houston, sought treatment late Saturday 
and remained in the hospital overnight, forcing him to pull out of 
the event, PGA spokesman Lee Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was only five strokes behind tournament leader Hal Sutton  
heading into Sunday's fourth and final round. 
</P>
<P>
	Elkington picked up his 10th career win in March at the Doral  
Ryder Open and is 12th on the PGA money list this year with 
$776,263 in winnings. His career victories also include a pair of 
Players Championships and the 1995 PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent most of 1998 fighting health problems, including a bout  
with meningitis, but bounced back to win the Buick Challenge in 
October.

<HEADLINE> Experts: Study Fish To Swim Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Swim like a fish? It's not possible unless you  
are one, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	But they say it is possible to study fish and learn to swim like  
a better human. 
</P>
<P>
	``These creatures have evolved for millennia,'' said U.S.  
national team coach Jonty Skinner in Colorado Springs, Colo. ``If 
they don't know how to do it right. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skinner tries to apply some fish skills when he trains his  
swimmers for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. For instance, 
he likes to see ``total body action'' as a swimmer moves through 
the water. A whole-body movement, with a mild undulation, is more 
fishlike -- and more efficient, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A normal human being would say the fish is flapping its tail  
and creating propulsion,'' Skinner said. ``Actually, it's not. It's 
the total movement of the body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A shark's swimming motion, for instance, starts with the head,  
grows through its powerful body and gets final propulsion from the 
tail, Skinner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that the tail motion is unimportant, said zoology professor  
Frank E. Fish of West Chester University, West Chester, Pa. The 
down-and-up motion of a dolphin's flukes creates a sort of pocket 
of low water pressure on one side of the tail, and high pressure on 
the other, he said. The dolphin's body is pulled toward the lower 
pressure and pushed away from the higher pressure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dolphin kick works less well for people because their knees  
don't bend in both directions as a dolphin's flukes do, Fish said. 
Just the same, visualizing a dolphin may help people with their 
dolphin kicks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A sea lion's flippers are long enough to create a pressure  
differential, giving the same lift effect that helps dolphins move 
forward, Fish said. Breast-strokers can hold their hands at a 
slight angle to the flow of water going past, and get some of the 
lift effect themselves, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, hands don't have a flipper's water-friendly form, Fish  
said. A hand is comparatively stubby, and it primarily pushes 
against the water like a paddle, he said. By pushing against the 
resistance of the water, the swimmer moves forward, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	More importantly, fish can teach people about streamlining, Fish  
said. A straighter body line has less drag against the flow of 
water, he said. Swimmers can reduce drag by not having their elbows 
and knees stuck out at odd angles. 
</P>
<P>
	People also can spend more time under water, said researcher M.  
Edwin DeMont of St. Francis Xavier University, Antigonish, Nova 
Scotia. This reduces the drag of waves on the surface, he said. 
Under the water, drag is minimized, and a swimmer can go faster, he 
said. A foot and a half under water is all the depth that most 
swimmers need, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, swimming organizations realize this and have  
set rules that limit distance under water. 
</P>
<P>
	There are some catches to studying fish, however, ``It's  
unlikely that humans will swim like fish to the same level of 
efficiency,'' said zoology professor Thomas Daniel of the 
University of Washington. Fish have some built-in advantages that 
go beyond even their fins and tails, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, fish slime apparently reduces the frictional drag  
of the fish's body through the water, Daniel said. People don't 
know how to duplicate this slippery stuff, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been stories of swimmers covering themselves in  
Vaseline,'' Daniel said. ``It wouldn't work.''

<HEADLINE> Soccer Referee Hit by Flying Object </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) -- Referee Hugh Dallas was hit in the head  
by an object thrown from the crowd and several fans charged onto 
the field during Sunday's game between Glasgow Celtic and Rangers -- 
an intense rivalry often dominated by religious conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas slumped to one knee with blood pouring from a head wound  
minutes after he expelled Celtic defender Stephane Mahe before 
60,000 fans at Celtic Park. The object was thought to be a coin. 
</P>
<P>
	A FIFA referee who officiated at last year's World Cup, Dallas  
remained in the game and one minute later awarded Rangers a penalty 
kick. That prompted more Celtic fans to run onto the the field, but 
they were removed by security. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas later ejected Rod Wallace of Rangers and Vidar Riseth of  
Celtic for on-field flareups in the last few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers won 3-0 to clinch their 10th title in 11 years -- their  
first-ever clinch at Celtic's home field. Sunday's game was the 
334th meeting of the two Glasgow rivals, who have dominated 
Scottish soccer since their first meeting in 1891. The rivalry has 
religious overtones, with Catholics supporting Celtic and 
Protestants backing Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. midfielder Claudio Reyna, who joined Rangers last month,  
took part in his first Old Firm derby. He had few chances on goal, 
had an effective game and avoided the flareups on the field.

<HEADLINE> Willey Credibility Key for Starr </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- A courtroom appearance by Susan McDougal.  
Serious problems with Kathleen Willey's credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's prosecutors may get more to  
handle than they expected in the trial of Julie Hiatt Steele. She 
is accused of obstructing Starr's investigation into Mrs. Willey's 
allegation that President Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance 
toward her. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr is coming off a stinging courtroom setback against Mrs.  
McDougal. So who planned to be on hand for jury selection today? 
</P>
<P>
	``Susan will be there front row center ... in support of  
Julie,'' said Mark Geragos, Mrs. McDougal's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton has made clear he will not  
allow Ms. Steele's lawyers to put Starr's tactics on trial, as 
happened when Ms. Steele testified in support of Mrs. McDougal, a 
former Whitewater investment partner of Clinton and his wife, 
Hillary. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele's lawyer, Nancy Luque, argued before Hilton that  
Starr's prosecutors made a series of misrepresentations, 
designating Ms. Steele as a mere witness in the investigation when 
they actually regarded her as a major focus of the probe. Ms. 
Steele was tricked into making statements for which she was later 
indicted, her legal team contends. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nancy Luque told me that if she sees an opening to put Starr  
on trial, she'll call Starr as her first witness and Susan McDougal 
right behind him,'' said Geragos. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense has subpoenaed testimony and notes from Newsweek  
magazine reporter Michael Isikoff, who first wrote about Mrs. 
Willey's allegation. The defense team also issued a subpoena to CBS 
for outtakes from a ``60 Minutes'' interview with Mrs. Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton has yet to decide whether to allow that evidence into the  
case. CBS and Newsweek are seeking to quash the subpoenas. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey says she confided Clinton's alleged sexual advance  
to Ms. Steele, a fellow resident of the Richmond, Va., area, the 
day it occurred in 1993. Ms. Steele initially supported Mrs. 
Willey's version of events to Newsweek, then recanted, telling her 
revised account to the FBI and two grand juries. 
</P>
<P>
	She now says the first time she heard the allegation was when  
Mrs. Willey called her in 1997 and asked her to back up her story 
to Isikoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office has not said whether Mrs. Willey will testify,  
but Ms. Steele's lawyers are assuming that she will and are 
marshaling evidence about Mrs. Willey's background that they hope 
to use to destroy her credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele lawyer Dan Marino referred to some of that evidence  
Friday, noting that one witness interviewed by Starr's office had 
``extremely bad things to say about Mrs. Willey's credibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another witness, said Marino, alleged that Mrs. Willey ``asked  
her to lie.'' He complained that Starr's office has been slow to 
turn over evidence calling Mrs. Willey's credibility into question. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office denies that and says the information from such  
witnesses has nothing to do with Mrs. Willey's accusation against 
Clinton. It says it has witnesses besides Mrs. Willey who will 
testify that Ms. Steele knew of the alleged sexual advance well 
before 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey aired her allegation in a national television  
interview 14 months ago, triggering a furious counterattack by the 
president's supporters. Clinton denied her story under oath. 
</P>
<P>
	In a risky move for a criminal defendant about to go on trial,  
Ms. Steele took the witness stand in the McDougal case and depicted 
herself as a struggling single parent who was a victim of a 
vengeful Starr. A juror in the McDougal trial in Little Rock, Ark., 
said later he found Ms. Steele's testimony compelling and that it 
gave added credibility to Mrs. McDougal's story that she feared 
Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors acquitted Mrs. McDougal of a charge she obstructed  
Starr's investigation and deadlocked on two counts of criminal 
contempt for refusing to testify before a grand jury.

<HEADLINE> Star Wars: May the Toys Be With You </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Force is with ``Star Wars'' fans, and it's  
telling them to hit the toy stores early and spend, spend, spend. 
</P>
<P>
	The most-hyped line of movie-themed merchandise in history -- for  
the still unreleased ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' 
-- is finally going on sale on a studio-imposed schedule, and fans 
and retailers aren't wasting a minute. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unprecedented move, Toys R Us stores around the country  
decided to open their doors at 12:01 a.m. Monday for an all-night 
selling marathon of toys based on the movie. Some FAO Schwarz 
stores planned to open from midnight to 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart and Kmart called in extra staff for their 24-hour  
stores to handle the post-midnight crowds. Many stores planned to 
limit the number of items a customer could buy to prevent immediate 
sell-outs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this will be very big,'' said Ken Crawford, manager of  
the Target discount store in Menlo Park, N.J., where extra cashiers 
and salespeople were told to be on the job when doors open at 8 
a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the virtual stores were ready for middle-of-the-night  
surfers with an itch to buy. Internet merchants Amazon.com and 
eToys planned to open their online ``Star Wars'' stores just after 
midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans had been waiting for months to get a glimpse of the vast  
array of goods -- from action figures to wigs to body lotion to 
snack food -- tied to the movie, which opens May 19.

<HEADLINE> Docors Revolting Against HMO Decree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For years, heath maintenance organizations have  
been telling you to see your primary-care doctor for nearly all of 
your medical needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, some of the nation's biggest HMOs are restricting the  
primary-care doctor's role in one of the most sensitive places -- 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past two years, HMOs have been hiring doctors called  
hospitalists, who work full time in hospitals coordinating care, 
replacing the role traditionally held by the patient's regular 
physician. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurers say patients tend to get more attention from  
hospitalists since the doctors aren't splitting their time between 
the hospital and an office. As a result, tests are scheduled faster 
and patients often go home sooner without care being compromised. 
</P>
<P>
	Shorter hospital stays mean HMOs can save money, which some  
critics suspect is the real reason behind the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, health plans offered the hospitalists as an option,  
and the reaction was mixed. But now that some plans such as 
Prudential Health Care and Humana have all but mandated the use of 
hospitalists, some doctors and consumer groups are outraged. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is incredible irony in this,'' said Ron Pollack,  
executive director of Families USA, a national consumer health 
group. ``HMOs have for the last few years talked about the virtue 
of having a primary-care physician who coordinates the care for a 
patient, and yet at a point when the patient most is in need of 
health care, they are withdrawing the central feature ... by the 
doctor who knows the patient best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A coalition of 24 medical groups, including the American College  
of Physicians, last month appealed to the HMO industry asking for 
an end to mandatory hospitalist programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a direct attack on our profession,'' said Dr. Cornel  
Lupu, a Miami internist and Prudential primary-care doctor. ``It's 
a horrible idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prudential started its hospitalist program in March in the South  
Florida and Tampa areas. Humana began implementing its program in 
1997 in a dozen major markets, including Chicago, South Florida, 
Louisville, Ky., Kansas City, Mo., Las Vegas and San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	Cigna and some Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans proposed  
mandatory hospitalist programs in certain markets, but decided to 
keep it voluntary after primary-care doctors raised concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Humana spokesman Greg Donaldson said a study of the company's  
use of hospitalists in Kansas City found that they shortened some 
hospital stays by half, and increased the likelihood that patients 
were prescribed appropriate medications. 
</P>
<P>
	And about 85 percent of Humana's members nationally who had been  
cared for by a hospitalist said they would want the same 
hospital-based doctor if they were hospitalized again, the company 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Prudential nor Humana considers its hospitalist programs  
mandatory because doctors can continue caring for their own 
patients in the hospital if they meet certain criteria, such as 
keeping the patient in the hospital for a shorter-than-average 
period. Prudential says fewer than 20 percent of its Tampa and 
South Florida doctors meet the standard. A Humana official did not 
know what proportion of its doctors met the tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to improve efficiency in the hospital and  
improve quality and as a result hopefully save some costs, said Dr. 
Kirk Cianciolo, Prudential's senior medical director for South 
Florida and Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	HMO industry experts say more health plans will require the use  
of hospitalists because they reduce hospital stays. 
</P>
<P>
	``More and more plans are considering making it a mandatory  
program, '' said Brett Turner, a health care consultant with 
Hamilton-HMC, based in Minneapolis. ``It's a major trend, a much 
more efficient way to practice quality medicine,'' he said. ``But 
making the transition is a difficult process for some.''

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Landless workers in Brazil are  
escalating their campaign of seizing land in their push for 
agrarian reform, a magazine reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Landless Workers Movement, known as the MST, invaded 244  
sites in the first four months of 1999, a 40 percent jump over the 
same period last year, Veja magazine reported. One-third were 
working ranches, Veja said. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the MST, in trying to court publicity, destroys the  
ranches it grabs, sometimes wrecking machinery or killing animals. 
</P>
<P>
	The MST, which has thousands of members in poor northeastern  
states, was founded in 1984 to urge land reforms in Brazil, where 
88 percent of arable land is owned by 20 percent of the population. 
The poorest 40 percent owns just 1 percent.

who escaped from a youth prison have been recaptured, police said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the most dangerous of the escapees, Gustavo Adolfo Paredes,  
remained at large. Paredes, 17, was serving a seven year sentence 
for killing at least 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine escaped early Friday from a makeshift youth prison in  
San Francisco Gotera, northeast of the capital. The prison, a 
converted military barracks, held 200 prisoners who had been 
transferred from another prison that is being remodeled.

	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- Nicaragua gains its fourth daily  
newspaper this week, a new 16-page paper called La Noticia that is 
due to appear on the stands in the capital Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a very modern newspaper in full color,'' said its  
director, Horacio Ruiz. The initial press run will be 7,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruiz, who long worked for the local daily La Prensa, said the  
paper at first will circulate only in the area of the capital while 
it acquires and installs its own press. The initial editions will 
be printed by another newspaper, El Nuevo Diario. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruiz said the newspaper will be independent, denying widespread  
rumors that it is linked to the governing Constitutionalist Liberal 
Party.

<HEADLINE> NATO: How Much Can Milosevic Take? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO leaders have insisted from Day 1 of the  
airstrikes on Yugoslavia that the bombs and missiles would keep 
flying until President Slobodan Milosevic decided to reverse course 
in Kosovo rather than end up as the ``ruler of rubble,'' as one 
allied general put it. 
</P>
<P>
	The question many are asking now is, how much more punishment  
can the Yugoslav leader take? NATO has hit his country with 
virtually every instrument of air power in its arsenal, yet he 
remains defiant. Is there any level of military, economic and 
political destruction that will push Milosevic to give up? 
</P>
<P>
	Allied military leaders say yes, but admit they can only guess  
when it might reach that point. After nearly six weeks of attacks 
from one end of Yugoslavia to the other, Milosevic has shown no 
sign of bending, although his firing of a deputy prime minister 
last week suggested internal strains. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have basically given Milosevic the on-off switch,'' says  
retired Adm. Leighton Smith, who dealt personally with the Yugoslav 
president while commanding NATO's Allied Forces Southern Europe 
during the Bosnia war. ``I'm not surprised he has stayed the course 
this long. He is a very stubborn person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith and others say the key to breaking Milosevic's will is  
eroding his base of political power while also pounding his 
military forces, which have continued their routing of ethnic 
Albanian villages in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``When his power structure begins to become threatened within  
Yugoslavia, that's when he may consider'' changing course, Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to the first four weeks of NATO's air campaign, the  
bombing in recent days has hit more political and economic targets 
that allied strategists believe are pillars of Milosevic's power 
base. These include his Socialist Party of Serbia offices, one of 
his Belgrade mansions and Serb TV headquarters. Roads, rail lines, 
bridges, oil refineries and other industrial plants also have been 
struck -- a degree of devastation that NATO officials say has set 
back the Yugoslav economy by 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are systematically taking apart President Milosevic's  
structure and power,'' U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, the top NATO 
commander, told reporters last week at alliance headquarters in 
Brussels, Belgium. ``I can't give you a prediction on how long he's 
going to endure this kind of punishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark said he still believes Milosevic eventually will conclude  
that accommodation with NATO is the only way out as he sees 
Yugoslavia isolated and NATO united in its determination to 
accelerate the bombing. In the meantime, there is no shortage of 
targets for NATO warplanes, which are still trying to cripple the 
extensive Yugoslav air defense system and stop Milosevic from 
reinforcing his troops in Kosovo. There also are more economic 
targets, including the civilian-military electric power and water 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The war will end, Clark said, when Milosevic ``comes to a full  
recognition of what the future holds and makes terms with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	German Gen. Klaus Naumann, chairman of NATO's military  
committee, acknowledged the possibility that the alliance misjudged 
Milosevic when it assumed he would not let Yugoslavia be torn 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our flaw may be that we think he may have at least a little  
bit of responsibility for his country and may act accordingly, 
since otherwise he may end up being the ruler of rubble,'' Naumann 
said in Washington last week. 
</P>
<P>
	So what if that flaw proves fatal for NATO and Milosevic  
outlasts the alliance? What if airstrikes can't finish the job and 
the allies decide against introducing ground forces to defeat the 
Serbs in Kosovo? Those are possibilities that many in Congress have 
raised, including Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Lieberman said he worries that NATO will discover Milosevic is  
``insanely intransigent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Then we're going to be left in a quandary,'' Lieberman said,  
``where we may have achieved our military objectives but not 
achieved our political objectives because the paramilitary ethnic 
slaughterers and expellers and rapists are going to remain in 
Kosovo.'' That, he said, would amount to defeat for NATO.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Team Arrives in Baltimore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cuba's national baseball team arrived in  
Baltimore on Sunday night and was greeted at the airport by Orioles 
owner Peter Angelos, Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke and baseball 
commissioner Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane touched down about 8:30 p.m. at Baltimore-Washington  
International Airport. On his way to a secluded area where he met 
the players, Angelos was asked who would win Monday night's rematch 
between the Orioles and the Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, we'll see tomorrow,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Felix Wilson, deputy chief of the Cuban Interest Section, which  
serves as an unofficial embassy in Washington, was upset that 
Angelos met with the players while local Cuban officials were kept 
away from the group until after the team cleared customs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you imagine we cannot meet the Cuban delegation?'' he  
said. ``This is unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ana Maria Goicoechea, a resident of Columbia, Md., who was born  
in Cuba, was one of handful of people who tried to welcome the team 
at the airport with a sign that said, ``Cuba Va,'' or ``Go Cuba.'' 
The professor of social work at the University of Maryland at 
Baltimore supports the game and improved relations with her native 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a war and it was lost by the people that are here,''  
she said. ``This is a process, a step we have to go through. Little 
by little, this anger will come out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She compared the situation to relations between the former East  
and West Germany, which were reunited in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``How could I not support them? I feel bad for this isolation my  
country, the United States, is imposing on our other country, 
Cuba,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team got a Havana Airport send-off from Cuban leader Fidel  
Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	After sorting out visa problems that delayed the flight, the  
team boarded a charter about 5 p.m. EDT for its exhibition game 
with the Baltimore Orioles on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the delay meant the Cubans had to cancel their Sunday  
workout at Camden Yards and a reception in the team's honor. 
</P>
<P>
	The visa problems, concerning some in the delegation of more  
than 300, were resolved Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	This will mark the first time a Cuban team has played a major  
league team in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In the opener of this series, the Orioles beat Cuba 3-2 in 11  
innings on March 28 in Havana. It was the first time in 40 years a 
major league team played in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	In the days leading to that game, the Orioles had to scramble to  
get their birth certificates, passports and visas in order. This 
time it was the Cubans who were tangled in red tape. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, the delay was thought to put Monday night's game  
in danger. But that is no longer the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles will be wearing their traditional black, orange and  
white for the rematch, but they'll be thinking red, white and blue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The important thing of every game is to win no matter what  
kind of uniform you wear or who you represent,'' Orioles pitcher 
Ricky Bones said Sunday. ``This time we're going to represent the 
United States. We should go out there with pride and try to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles have struggled mightily since beating Cuba in March.  
The team is in last place, the players are being booed at Camden 
Yards and manager Ray Miller might not have his job by the end of 
the 12-game homestand Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	So the Orioles can be forgiven if they don't regard the game  
with great anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, you'd like the club to have a day off,'' Miller  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's much the same attitude the Orioles carried into the first  
exhibition. But shortly after the playing of both country's 
national anthems, their attitude changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot more comes into it than just you or your team. Even  
though we weren't really representing the U.S., we were in a way,'' 
outfielder B.J. Surhoff said. ``We were one team but we were 
representing a whole lot of people. They looked at it as their 
national team representing them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Down there I knew it would be really intense and they'd be  
into it. I'm kind of curious to see how it's all going to play out 
tomorrow night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first game, many of Cuba's best players were unavailable  
because they were involved in the country's playoffs. There was no 
such obstacle this time, so the Orioles can expect even more 
competition in the rematch. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll have a better team this time. They'll have better  
players to choose from,'' said catcher Charles Johnson, whose 
two-run homer provided the majority of Baltimore's offense in the 
first game. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller hoped to rest his starters after six innings of that  
game, but the close score and high intensity caused him to stick 
with most of his stars for the entire contest. He will use his 
regular lineup Monday with the exception of his starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Kamieniecki, who is on the disabled list, will start for  
Baltimore. The Orioles can only hope the Cubans don't counter with 
Jose Contreras, who allowed two hits over eight shutout innings and 
struck out 10 in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
	While many of the Orioles consider the game a distraction, they  
realize the prestige associated with representing their country. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Twins manager Tom Kelly, whose team faced the Orioles  
on Sunday, wished he could be a part of the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd take it as an honor to manage and represent major league  
baseball in that endeavor,'' he said. ``I think I would really 
enjoy it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles merely want to make the best of the situation.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of pride taken over in Cuba. We did everything  
we could to win that game and I'm sure it will be no different over 
here,'' backup catcher Lenny Webster said. ``We hope to enjoy it, 
but at the same time we're going to try and beat them.''

<HEADLINE> Experts: Study Fish To Swim Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Swim like a fish? It's not possible unless you  
are one, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	But they say it is possible to study fish and learn to swim like  
a better human. 
</P>
<P>
	``These creatures have evolved for millennia,'' said U.S.  
national team coach Jonty Skinner in Colorado Springs, Colo. ``If 
they don't know how to do it right. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skinner tries to apply some fish skills when he trains his  
swimmers for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. For instance, 
he likes to see ``total body action'' as a swimmer moves through 
the water. A whole-body movement, with a mild undulation, is more 
fishlike -- and more efficient, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A normal human being would say the fish is flapping its tail  
and creating propulsion,'' Skinner said. ``Actually, it's not. It's 
the total movement of the body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A shark's swimming motion, for instance, starts with the head,  
grows through its powerful body and gets final propulsion from the 
tail, Skinner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that the tail motion is unimportant, said zoology professor  
Frank E. Fish of West Chester University, West Chester, Pa. The 
down-and-up motion of a dolphin's flukes creates a sort of pocket 
of low water pressure on one side of the tail, and high pressure on 
the other, he said. The dolphin's body is pulled toward the lower 
pressure and pushed away from the higher pressure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dolphin kick works less well for people because their knees  
don't bend in both directions as a dolphin's flukes do, Fish said. 
Just the same, visualizing a dolphin may help people with their 
dolphin kicks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A sea lion's flippers are long enough to create a pressure  
differential, giving the same lift effect that helps dolphins move 
forward, Fish said. Breast-strokers can hold their hands at a 
slight angle to the flow of water going past, and get some of the 
lift effect themselves, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, hands don't have a flipper's water-friendly form, Fish  
said. A hand is comparatively stubby, and it primarily pushes 
against the water like a paddle, he said. By pushing against the 
resistance of the water, the swimmer moves forward, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	More importantly, fish can teach people about streamlining, Fish  
said. A straighter body line has less drag against the flow of 
water, he said. Swimmers can reduce drag by not having their elbows 
and knees stuck out at odd angles. 
</P>
<P>
	People also can spend more time under water, said researcher M.  
Edwin DeMont of St. Francis Xavier University, Antigonish, Nova 
Scotia. This reduces the drag of waves on the surface, he said. 
Under the water, drag is minimized, and a swimmer can go faster, he 
said. A foot and a half under water is all the depth that most 
swimmers need, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, swimming organizations realize this and have  
set rules that limit distance under water. 
</P>
<P>
	There are some catches to studying fish, however, ``It's  
unlikely that humans will swim like fish to the same level of 
efficiency,'' said zoology professor Thomas Daniel of the 
University of Washington. Fish have some built-in advantages that 
go beyond even their fins and tails, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, fish slime apparently reduces the frictional drag  
of the fish's body through the water, Daniel said. People don't 
know how to duplicate this slippery stuff, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been stories of swimmers covering themselves in  
Vaseline,'' Daniel said. ``It wouldn't work.''

<HEADLINE> Colo. Students To Return To Class </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORRISON, Colo. (AP) -- Columbine High School students and  
teachers on Sunday poured out bittersweet stories about their 
fallen friends in a final memorial service at a majestic outdoor 
amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
	The sun shined over the Red Rocks arena, whose awesome acoustics  
have drawn artists ranging from the Beatles to Pearl Jam to 
now-famous Columbine graduates Big Head Todd and the Monsters, who 
opened Sunday's memorial with a song. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd was spared the rains that have deluged the area since  
shortly after the April 20 massacre of 12 students and one teacher 
at the Littleton high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just what the doctor ordered,'' said school board  
president Jon DeStefano, at the end of the nearly two-hour service. 
``It's time to get back up on the horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He promised they will get their school back -- there had been  
talk of demolishing it and rebuilding a new facility. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the students go back to class at nearby Chatfield  
High School, their former rival. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not allow this tragedy to erase the 27 years of  
excellence that Columbine represents,'' principal Frank DeAngelis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also vowed the students would be safe.  
</P>
<P>
	Close friends of the 12 slain students and teacher Dave Sanders  
told stories to the 3,000 students, parents and teachers assembled 
at Red Rocks about 15 miles west of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Baumgartner said he was told to compress Rachel Scott's  
life into one minute, and then he listed all the bad things she 
never was. 
</P>
<P>
	He ended it with: ``This has been the one-minute version of  
Rachel's life. I can assure you the 17-year version was a heckuva 
lot better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Student representatives from each of the four grades sent  
get-well wishes to the 23 wounded, five of whom remained in the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want you to know that we miss you guys and that we look  
forward to having you back again in school with us,'' said Tim 
Matteson, the sophomore class representative. 
</P>
<P>
	Two science teachers unfurled a banner at the front of the stage  
in honor of all Columbine students. It read ``You are OUR heroes.'' 
Two-hundred columbines were placed in front of the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Student body president Heather Dinkel urged students to wear  
their T-shirts that say ``We are Columbine'' on Monday, when they 
return to class at Chatfield. 
</P>
<P>
	The memorial service opened with a song by Big Head Todd and the  
Monsters, who won Columbine's school talent show in 1984. They 
performed a song called ``Brother John,'' which included the 
lyrics: ``Children give up, don't you ever. Remember that the 
devil's clever. ... Heaven could be anywhere, why not here?'' 
</P>
<P>
	As mourners gathered at the amphitheater, others gravitated to a  
memorial near the school in Littleton. Around town, Columbine 
students got ready to go to school at their old rival. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to go back for sure,'' said Tiffany Typher, an  
18-year-old senior wearing a ``CHS'' ribbon in her hair. But, she 
said, ``I don't want to go to Chatfield. I'd rather go back to 
Columbine, just to have closure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine is still a massive crime scene after two student  
gunmen went on a shooting and bombing spree April 20, killing 12 
students, a teacher and themselves. The school won't be reopened 
until the fall, at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine's nearly 2,000 students will finish out the year at  
Chatfield, three miles away. Under a school district plan, 
Chatfield students will attend classes in the morning and Columbine 
students in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Deputy Sheriff Troy Gardalen said Sunday that the  
parents of gunman Dylan Klebold were ``very cooperative'' in an 
hour-and-forty-five-minute interview with investigators. Thomas and 
Susan Klebold met with authorities Friday to answer questions about 
their 17-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents of the other gunman, 18-year-old Eric Harris, have  
refused to talk with investigators unless they are granted immunity 
from criminal prosecution.

<HEADLINE> Willey Credibility Key for Starr </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- The credibility of Kathleen Willey, the  
former White House volunteer who accused President Clinton of 
making an unwanted sexual advance, is the key to Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Starr's latest criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey's one-time friend, Julie Hiatt Steele, is charged  
with lying to investigators when she undercut Mrs. Willey's story. 
The trial, opening Monday in federal court across the river from 
Washington, will revive lingering questions about what, if 
anything, happened between the president and Mrs. Willey in a room 
next to the Oval Office in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey aired her allegation in a national television  
interview 14 months ago, triggering a furious counterattack by the 
president's supporters. Clinton denied her story under oath. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the Monica Lewinsky case, Starr investigated Mrs.  
Willey's account but did not assemble enough evidence to include 
any related information in his impeachment referral to Congress. 
One reason he did not was Ms. Steele's testimony that Mrs. Willey 
had asked her to lie to back up the allegation against the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele's trial on three obstruction counts and one count of  
making false statements is the only criminal trial to arise out of 
the Lewinsky investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton has said he will not allow Ms.  
Steele's lawyers to put Starr's tactics on trial, which happened in 
the case of Clinton's former business partner, Susan McDougal. In 
that trial, Ms. Steele testified that she had been indicted because 
she refused to help Starr. McDougal's lawyer said her client plans 
to attend the opening of Steele's trial to show support. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele's lawyer, Nancy Luque, argued that Starr's office  
made a series of misrepresentations in order to trick Ms. Steele 
into making the statements that led to her indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense has subpoenaed testimony and notes from Newsweek  
reporter Michael Isikoff, who first wrote about Mrs. Willey's 
allegation, and from CBS for outtakes from a ``60 Minutes'' 
interview with Mrs. Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge has yet to decide whether to allow that evidence into  
the case, and CBS and Newsweek have objected to the subpoenas. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey says she confided the alleged advance to Ms. Steele  
the day it occurred in 1993. Ms. Steele initially supported Mrs. 
Willey's version of events to Newsweek, then recanted, telling her 
revised account to the FBI and two grand juries. 
</P>
<P>
	She now says the first time she heard the allegation was when  
Mrs. Willey called her in 1997 and asked her to back up her story 
to Isikoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office has not said whether Mrs. Willey will testify,  
but Ms. Steele's lawyers are assuming she will and are marshaling 
evidence about Mrs. Willey's background that they hope to use to 
destroy her credibility in front of a jury. 
</P>
<P>
	In a risky move for a criminal defendant about to go on trial,  
Ms. Steele testified last month at the McDougal trial and was 
depicted as a struggling single parent and victim of a vengeful 
Starr. A juror in the McDougal trial said later he found Ms. 
Steele's testimony compelling and that it gave added credibility to 
Mrs. McDougal's story that she was frightened of Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors acquitted Mrs. McDougal on a charge of obstructing  
Starr's investigation and deadlocked on two counts of criminal 
contempt for refusing to testify before a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys haven't said whether Ms. Steele will take the  
stand in her own defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor David Barger and the judge indicated the government's  
case against Ms. Steele might take only a few days.

<HEADLINE> Elway Makes Retirement Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- He sounded so very upbeat at the start,  
cracking jokes and telling stories about himself and his Denver 
Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	Then John Elway turned to his retirement -- and that's when it  
hit him. 
</P>
<P>
	His face crumpled and the sobs came.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't do it physically anymore, and that's really hard for  
me to say,'' the 38-year-old Elway said Sunday, pausing frequently 
to regain his composure as he addressed the crowd at a suburban 
Denver hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to walk away. I can't explain in words how much  
everyone has meant to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After dazzling fans and confounding defenses for 16 years, the  
quarterback made official what everyone had known for more than a 
week. He delayed the announcement because of the school killings in 
Littleton, and his news conference began with a moment of silence 
for the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, master of the last-minute comeback, becomes the third  
superstar to leave his sport since January, joining Michael Jordan 
and Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	``The over-under in the locker room yesterday was how many times  
I'd cry,'' Elway said through his husky, choked voice. ``I took the 
under.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, after crying some more, he added, ``I lost the bet.''  
</P>
<P>
	Elway, wearing a blue-and-silver ribbon on his suit jacket in  
memory of the shooting victims, was joined on the stage by Broncos 
coach Mike Shanahan and team owner Pat Bowlen. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway's wife, Janet, and their four children sat in the front  
row. The children smiled at their dad's jokes and remained poised 
when he broke down. Janet, however, cried as her husband spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``For 16 years, the family life has focused around me and  
football, and it's time it focuses around them,'' Elway said. ``I 
couldn't ask for a better mom and dad and a better wife. I'm tough 
to live with. Thank God she's still with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked what he'd miss most about Sunday afternoons, Elway  
said, ``I'll never be able to fill the void of playing a football 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he'd miss the huddle and telling talkative tight end  
Shannon Sharpe ``to be quiet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know you're open, I know you're open, I know you're open,''  
Elway said about Sharpe, drawing loud laughs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe attended the news conference along with several other  
current and former teammates, including running back Terrell Davis 
and Elway's heir apparent, Bubby Brister. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it's like Haley's Comet,'' Sharpe said. ``It only  
comes along every 77 years, and I got an opportunity to play with 
him. That's what it's like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For years, the only thing missing from Elway's resume was a  
Super Bowl title, and he took care of that by winning two straight. 
In his final game, he was voted Super Bowl MVP in a 34-19 win over 
Atlanta last January. 
</P>
<P>
	He becomes the only quarterback to retire after winning a Super  
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I truly believe John was the very best to ever play,'' Bowlen  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway was exceptionally durable throughout his career, missing  
only 15 starts because of illness or injury, but his retirement was 
hastened by the sheer wear and tear of professional football. He 
was hit more than any quarterback in NFL history, absorbing 559 
sacks in 256 games. 
</P>
<P>
	He compiled the best passer rating of his career in 1998, but  
his season was interrupted by hamstring, back and rib injuries that 
caused him to miss all or part of six games. His deteriorating, 
arthritic left knee probably will have to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, his toughness and productivity might never be equaled.  
</P>
<P>
	``To John Elway, football was the greatest game in the world,''  
commissioner Paul Tagliabue said in a statement. ``And to the game 
of football, John Elway was the greatest ambassador imaginable. He 
combined talent and character to become an incomparable performer 
and champion on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway talked about many of the memorable moments in his career,  
including The Drive in Cleveland in 1986 -- ``That one put me on the 
map,'' Elway said -- and even his first pro game on Sept. 4, 1983, 
in Pittsburgh when he went 1-for-8 for 14 yards with an 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think I was going to last a year,'' he said. ``Jack  
Lambert was snarling at me with no teeth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Elway came back.  
</P>
<P>
	He guided his team to more victories (148) than any other  
quarterback in NFL history. He threw for 51,475 yards and accounted 
for 54,882 total yards -- second only to Miami's Dan Marino. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the only player ever to pass for 3,000 yards and rush for  
200 yards in seven straight seasons (1985-91). 
</P>
<P>
	Elway also rallied his team to 47 game-saving drives -- more than  
any other quarterback. He was selected to nine Pro Bowls and was 
named the NFL's MVP in 1987. He holds 55 Broncos' regular-season or 
postseason records. 
</P>
<P>
	``They talk about 47 comebacks,'' Shanahan said. ``The thing  
that was so impressive was the concentration level and poise and 
thriving on pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After three ugly Super Bowl losses early in his career, Elway  
began to wonder if he would ever get another opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	But thanks to a dynamic running game designed around Davis,  
Denver went to two straight Super Bowls and won them both. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Green Bay in January 1998, Elway set the tone by  
scrambling and diving into two defenders for a first down to set up 
a Denver touchdown late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In the closing minutes, Elway accounted for his 45th game-saving  
drive, completing a 23-yard pass to Howard Griffith to help set up 
Davis' go-ahead scoring run in the 31-24 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that I've been labeled as the guy who's never been on  
the winning Super Bowl team,'' a jubilant Elway said at the time. 
``Boy, am I glad to get rid of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a personally more satisfying performance a year later, he led  
the Broncos past Atlanta. With the Falcons stacking their defense 
to stop Davis, they dared Elway to beat them. He did, completing 18 
of 29 passes for 336 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway became the first quarterback ever to start in five Super  
Bowls, and the Broncos' 23-10 win over the New York Jets in the AFC 
championship game two weeks earlier gave him a 5-1 record in 
conference championship games -- the best in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
	In retirement, he said he plans to devote more time to his  
family and work on his golf game. He has expressed interest in 
getting into broadcasting, perhaps on the Monday night ABC games. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, who has an economics degree from Stanford, could also  
venture into the business world. He had been part-owner of some of 
the most successful auto dealerships in Denver. He and his partners 
sold them in 1997 for $82.5 million, but Elway's name remains on 
the businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't look at it as a retirement,'' Elway said. ``I look on  
it as graduation. You graduate from high school and you graduate 
from college. I'm graduating from pro football.''

<HEADLINE>  Bulls Bask in Win Over Miami Heat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- It's easy to imagine the reaction by M.J., Scottie  
and the Worm when they saw the score. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumbfounded disbelief. And then delight.  
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan and company always loved to beat the Heat, and  
that's what the Chicago Bulls did Saturday. The defending NBA 
champions lived up to their billing for a change by shocking Miami 
101-86. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat were without Alonzo Mourning, sidelined by an eye  
injury, but so what? The Bulls were without Jordan, Scottie Pippen 
and Dennis Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	``When M.J. calls, I'm going to say I know how he feels some  
nights,'' Bulls guard Ron Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper scored 25 points, all in the second half, and the team  
with the worst record in the Eastern Conference beat the 
first-place Heat, jumbling the playoff picture. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning and coach Pat Riley watched from opposite ends of the  
Heat bench, mirror images of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not disappointed. I'm not discouraged. I'm just absolutely  
disgusted,'' Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami fans felt likewise. They expected the Bulls to play as  
poorly as that other dismantled championship team, the Florida 
Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, in keeping with spring tradition, Chicago dealt Miami  
another crushing defeat. The Heat have made the playoffs five 
times, and three times -- in 1992, 1996 and 1997 -- they were 
eliminated by Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Heat and Bulls go back years,'' Harper said. ``There have  
been a lot of hard-fought games, so this one feels good for all of 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The win left the Bulls a bit giddy in the locker room. Someone  
wrote ``Machine-Gun Harper'' on the blackboard. Toni Kukoc 
pretended to drink cologne in celebration. Dickey Simpkins became 
almost incoherent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've lost games this season by a lot of money -- I mean  
points,'' Simpkins said. ``There's nothing better than beating 
Miami by double figures on their court at crunch time. We feel 
great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls started two obscure rookies and took the court with  
the worst offense in the NBA. They had scored a league record-low 
49 points in losing to Miami just three weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	But by halftime, Chicago had 48 points -- and the lead. Sparked  
by Harper, they built the margin to 22 points in the third period 
and never faltered in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls repeatedly took advantage of Mourning's absence by  
driving inside, and then Harper got hot from the outside. After 
missing his only shot in the first half, he finished 9-for-14, 
including 4-for-7 from 3-point range. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I've seen Ron Harper play like that in a long  
time,'' Riley said. ``He was saving one for us, because he was 
absolutely extraordinary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls made half their shots for only the second time all  
season, sinking 58 percent, the best effort against Miami in 
Riley's four years as coach. Chicago exceeded its scoring average 
by 19 points and topped 100 for just the third time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Bulls fans enjoyed this game,'' Kukoc said with a  
broad grin, perhaps feeling the effects of the cologne. 
</P>
<P>
	Also happy were the Orlando Magic, Indiana Pacers and Atlanta  
Hawks, all trying to overtake Miami for the conference 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though we're not going to the playoffs, it's important to  
establish some momentum for next season,'' Simpkins said. ``Why not 
come in and mess up someone else's playoff chances and try to gain 
some respect at the same time?'' 
</P>
<P>
	So if Saturday's win wasn't exactly Game 7 of the NBA Finals, it  
was the Bulls' biggest victory since then. 
</P>
<P>
	``By far,'' Harper said. ``We enjoyed beating Miami.''  
</P>
<P>
	In Chicago, that's one thing that hasn't changed.

<HEADLINE> Citadel To Graduate Woman Cadet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- The bitter fight over admitting women to  
The Citadel now long past, Nancy Mace is about to become the 
156-year-old South Carolina state military school's first female 
cadet to graduate. 
</P>
<P>
	Mace, who entered in the fall of 1996 after the college dropped  
its all-male admissions policy, is to receive her degree with about 
400 male cadets at commencement ceremonies on Saturday. The 
business major transferred credits from a community college to 
graduate a year early. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's done it all on her own with no help from daddy,'' said  
her father, retired Army Brig. Gen. J. Emory Mace, who became the 
school's commandant of cadets during his daughter's first year 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would make an effort not to associate with her,'' he said.  
``You need to make it on your own and blend in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mace, 21, who is taking an analyst job with a business  
consulting firm in Charlotte, N.C., leaves the Citadel with a 
mixture of pride and humility. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still don't think of it in an historic context,'' she said  
in Sunday's The (Charleston) Post and Courier. ``I just wanted an 
opportunity to join the long, gray line. I think I am paving the 
way for other women ... but I don't think of myself as a pioneer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Citadel now has 42 female cadets, a number expected to  
increase to about 90 next year, said Bonnie Jo Houchen, who 
graduated with the first women at the U.S. Air Force Academy and 
now serves as The Citadel's assistant commandant helping oversee 
the assimilation of women. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to give everyone time to accept the reality,''  
Houchen said. ``Some men in the corps still don't like women 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shannon Faulkner sued over the all-male admissions policy and  
became the first woman cadet under a federal court order in 1995, 
but she dropped out after less than a week, citing the loneliness 
and stress. 
</P>
<P>
	The legal fight continued with other women while the state and  
Citadel supporters contended that all-male schools promoted 
diversity in education. Before the case could reach the U.S. 
Supreme Court, however, the justices ruled that Virginia Military 
Institute's all-male policy was unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with that decision, Citadel officials decided to open the  
school's gates to women. Two women will graduate from VMI this year 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Mace entered The Citadel in 1996 with four other women, two of  
whom left after a semester, saying they had been hazed and 
harassed. The fourth was Petra Lovetinska, who will oversee 
military training for freshmen athletes this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my company, guys will tell me, 'I didn't like women coming  
here and I still don't like women here but I respect what you do 
and I respect you,' '' said Lovetinska. ``Some of my biggest 
supporters did fight the fight and they didn't want women at The 
Citadel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regimental Commander Reed Wilson, the school's highest-ranking  
cadet, said women will be more accepted with each passing year. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see the class of '99 leave you will see a change in  
the air here,'' Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mace told the Charleston newspaper her graduation has more  
meaning because of the hardships she endured. 
</P>
<P>
	``Separating your emotions all the time is very tiring and I  
have broken down in tears,'' she said. ``But I have never said I 
wanted to quit.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Struggles in World Hockey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMAR, Norway (AP) -- Winner of 23 world titles and eight Olympic  
gold medals as the Soviet Union, Russia appears a weaker team at 
hockey's world championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians struggled to a 2-2 tie Sunday against Belarus,  
which is making only its second appearance in this tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottawa Senators captain Alexei Yashin, the only NHL player on  
the Russian team, scored the opening goal in the Group D game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's right to say we're disappointed,'' Yashin  
said. ``It was only our first game and our team was nervous at the 
start. I'm sure we'll get better as we go along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sergei Tertyshny saved Russia from a loss by scoring the tying  
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Group B opener in Oslo, Switzerland rallied to beat Latvia  
5-3. The United States opened play in Group C on Saturday by 
routing Japan 7-1. The Americans play Austria in Oslo on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Belarus-Russia game, Yashin showed no lingering effects  
from a fever, scoring short-handed 4:19 into the game. Oleg Romanov 
answered for Belarus 1:15 later with a wrist shot from the blue 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11:04 into the second, Aleksandr Andrievsky put Belarus  
ahead, swiping in a rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians averted an upset by the former Soviet republic when  
Tertyshny flipped the puck above goalie Andrei Mezin's right glove 
from the top of the slot at 5:02 in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team was nervous in the first period but they played well  
in the other two,'' Yashin said. ``Belarus played a good game and 
they didn't give us many opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, there was the danger we might lose at one point,  
but if you are afraid of losing, chances are you will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Oslo, Marcel Jenni led the way for the Swiss, last year's  
surprising semifinalist. He broke a 3-3 tie at 18:39 in the second 
period and added the go-ahead goal at 13:44 in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
	On his last goal, he stole the puck from a Latvian near the blue  
line, skated in and beat goalie Andrejs Zinkovs to the stick side. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathias Seger, Mark Streit and Mattia Baldi had the other Swiss  
goals. Aleksandrs Semjonovs, Aleksandrs Kercs and Andrejs Maticins 
scored for Latvia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a young team and they were nervous early,'' Swiss  
coach Ralph Krueger said. ``But they played really well in the 
third period and we also had excellent goaltending.''

<HEADLINE> Conn. School Honors Dylan McDermott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) -- Dylan McDermott was late to school. But  
he didn't get in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor, who plays lawyer Bobby Donnell on ABC's ``The  
Practice,'' was scheduled to attend a fund-raiser Saturday at his 
old grade school, St. Mary's School, and receive a Distinguished 
Alumnus Award. 
</P>
<P>
	His flight from St. Louis was canceled, so the ceremony was  
pushed back nearly two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm filled with so many different emotions coming back to  
Waterbury,'' McDermott said when he finally arrived. ``I'm here 
being honored, but I think we should be honoring St. Mary's. The 
school gave me so much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDermott, dressed in a charcoal designer suit with matching  
shirt and tie, took some ribbing about looking like his character 
on ``The Practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always in a suit,'' he said. ``I can't seem to get away  
from it.''

<HEADLINE> Doctor: Harris, Klebold Deadly Mix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Eric Harris was a troubled teen,  
apparently suffering from depression and obsession. Dylan Klebold 
was a follower, who was rejected by his peers and who found 
acceptance from Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	Psychologists say that was a deadly mix, exploding April 20 at  
Columbine High School when the pair marched through the school's 
halls, killing 13 of their classmates and then themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``What leads to violence in kids is a series of problems:  
problems with the parents, a feeling of low self-esteem, a pattern 
of being rejected,'' said Dr. Jeff Dolgan, chief of psychology at 
Children's Hospital in Denver. ``These kids were in a group that 
was put down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, whose father retired to Colorado from the U.S. Air  
Force, railed against his tormentors on his Internet web page, 
saying ``we have many enemies in our school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also warned of the attack that he planned for a year, saying  
``I don't care if I live or die in the shootout.'' The pair timed 
their assault for Adolf Hitler's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Just five days before the attack, the Marine Corps rejected  
Harris as a recruit because he had been taking the antidepressant 
drug Luvox. He also reportedly was turned down by a girl he wanted 
to take to the prom. An autopsy found no drugs -- illegal or 
prescription -- in his body. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Don Marxhausen, pastor of St. Philip Lutheran Church in  
Littleton and pastor for the Klebolds, said his daughters knew 
Harris as a young man filled with rage. He said Klebold, ``a nice 
young man with above-average intelligence,'' was easily pulled 
under Harris' spell. 
</P>
<P>
	``Harris was just so charismatic, but he was definitely angry,''  
Marxhausen said. ``There was just such a rage in Harris. You either 
had to follow him or get away from him,'' the pastor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and Klebold found comfort and refuge in a group called  
the ``Trenchcoat Mafia,'' a group of about a dozen school outcasts 
who bought floor-length dusters at a western store sale for $99 
each. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the group were angry because ``jocks'' and other  
members of the school elite teased and harassed them, throwing 
rocks and cigarettes at them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everywhere they went, they were teased about how they  
dressed,'' Harris' former girlfriend, Tiffany Typher, told The 
Denver Post. ``If you're called a psycho all your life, you're 
going to live out that reputation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friends said Klebold joined up with Harris about four years ago  
and began shunning his former friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Eric and Dylan got together, Eric changed Dylan's  
demeanor. Dylan was a follower, who was constantly looking for 
someone to lead,'' said Nick Baumgart, 17, a senior who met Dylan 
in grade school. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold and Harris got their own home computers, and linked them  
with modems, playing simulated shooting games like ``Doom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They had death matches with violent computer games, matching  
computer to computer,'' Baumgart said. ``I don't believe violent 
video games lead to violence, but this was different. They'd play 
these games for hours and hours and hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. John Kluck, a psychiatrist at the University of Colorado  
Health Sciences Center, said the youths did a good job of hiding 
their antisocial behavior from their parents and authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Following their arrest on criminal trespass, theft and mischief  
charges, the two boys were ordered to perform community service and 
write apology letters. Harris' juvenile diversion supervisor wrote 
that the boy enjoyed his anger management class and he called him 
``a bright young man who is likely to succeed in life.'' 
Supervisors wrote that Klebold needed to work on his motivation. 
</P>
<P>
	``They played social roles so they didn't stand out to the  
judges or their parents,'' Kluck said. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Good knew Harris, the schoolmate who lived in the gray,  
two-story home two doors down. He said Klebold often came over in 
his older BMW to visit Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt, 16, now wonders about the explosions neighbors heard in a  
nearby meadow. But other than that, ``We never saw anything to be 
alarmed about,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Good said Harris and Klebold spoke German to each other in  
the hallway and talked a lot about World War II, Hitler and the 
Nazis. ``He thought Eric was a little strange, and he didn't want 
to associate with him,'' said Matt's father, Mike Good. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Beard, a fellow student, said Harris came to class in  
steel-toed combat boots and a German cross. Harris was also said to 
be a big fan of Rammstein, a German industrial, or techno, rock 
band. 
</P>
<P>
	John House, 17, a senior, said he refused to associate with  
Klebold after he joined the Trenchcoat Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went bowling with him, and when he would do something good,  
he would shout, `Heil Hitler!' and throw up his hand,'' House said. 
``It just made everyone mad.''

<HEADLINE> Bulls Bask in Win Over Miami Heat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- It's easy to imagine the reaction by M.J., Scottie  
and the Worm when they saw the score. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumbfounded disbelief. And then delight.  
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan and company always loved to beat the Heat, and  
that's what the Chicago Bulls did Saturday. The defending NBA 
champions lived up to their billing for a change by shocking Miami 
101-86. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat were without Alonzo Mourning, sidelined by an eye  
injury, but so what? The Bulls were without Jordan, Scottie Pippen 
and Dennis Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	``When M.J. calls, I'm going to say I know how he feels some  
nights,'' Bulls guard Ron Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper scored 25 points, all in the second half, and the team  
with the worst record in the Eastern Conference beat the 
first-place Heat, jumbling the playoff picture. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning and coach Pat Riley watched from opposite ends of the  
Heat bench, mirror images of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not disappointed. I'm not discouraged. I'm just absolutely  
disgusted,'' Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami fans felt likewise. They expected the Bulls to play as  
poorly as that other dismantled championship team, the Florida 
Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, in keeping with spring tradition, Chicago dealt Miami  
another crushing defeat. The Heat have made the playoffs five 
times, and three times -- in 1992, 1996 and 1997 -- they were 
eliminated by Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Heat and Bulls go back years,'' Harper said. ``There have  
been a lot of hard-fought games, so this one feels good for all of 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The win left the Bulls a bit giddy in the locker room. Someone  
wrote ``Machine-Gun Harper'' on the blackboard. Toni Kukoc 
pretended to drink cologne in celebration. Dickey Simpkins became 
almost incoherent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've lost games this season by a lot of money -- I mean  
points,'' Simpkins said. ``There's nothing better than beating 
Miami by double figures on their court at crunch time. We feel 
great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls started two obscure rookies and took the court with  
the worst offense in the NBA. They had scored a league record-low 
49 points in losing to Miami just three weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	But by halftime, Chicago had 48 points -- and the lead. Sparked  
by Harper, they built the margin to 22 points in the third period 
and never faltered in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls repeatedly took advantage of Mourning's absence by  
driving inside, and then Harper got hot from the outside. After 
missing his only shot in the first half, he finished 9-for-14, 
including 4-for-7 from 3-point range. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I've seen Ron Harper play like that in a long  
time,'' Riley said. ``He was saving one for us, because he was 
absolutely extraordinary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls made half their shots for only the second time all  
season, sinking 58 percent, the best effort against Miami in 
Riley's four years as coach. Chicago exceeded its scoring average 
by 19 points and topped 100 for just the third time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Bulls fans enjoyed this game,'' Kukoc said with a  
broad grin, perhaps feeling the effects of the cologne. 
</P>
<P>
	Also happy were the Orlando Magic, Indiana Pacers and Atlanta  
Hawks, all trying to overtake Miami for the conference 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though we're not going to the playoffs, it's important to  
establish some momentum for next season,'' Simpkins said. ``Why not 
come in and mess up someone else's playoff chances and try to gain 
some respect at the same time?'' 
</P>
<P>
	So if Saturday's win wasn't exactly Game 7 of the NBA Finals, it  
was the Bulls' biggest victory since then. 
</P>
<P>
	``By far,'' Harper said. ``We enjoyed beating Miami.''  
</P>
<P>
	In Chicago, that's one thing that hasn't changed.

<HEADLINE>  Grissom's Mercury Capsule Located </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Lost at sea for 38 years, astronaut  
Gus Grissom's Mercury capsule was found over the weekend by an 
underwater salvage team that had been searching for the spacecraft 
300 miles offshore. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty Bell 7 is still 3 miles deep in the Atlantic.  
</P>
<P>
	The cable to a remotely operated rover used to identify and  
photograph the capsule snapped in the rough sea Saturday night and 
the rover sank. The salvagers are returning to Port Canaveral for 
new equipment and will have to wait at least a few weeks before 
going back to recover the spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	But at least they know now where it is and they're thrilled  
about Saturday's discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks to be in beautiful condition and certainly capable of  
being recovered,'' expedition leader Curt Newport said Sunday by 
phone from the ship, the Needham Tide. 
</P>
<P>
	The only U.S. spacecraft ever lost following a successful  
mission, the capsule is still shiny in spots with an intact window 
and the name ``Liberty Bell 7'' clearly printed beneath it. Even 
the fake crack that was painted on the capsule to replicate the 
real Liberty Bell is still visible, as are the singe marks left by 
the explosives that blew out the hatch following splashdown on July 
21, 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty Bell 7 sank following Grissom's successful 15-minute  
suborbital flight -- the nation's second manned space flight. The 
explosive bolts that blow open the hatch detonated prematurely, and 
helicopter rescuers were unable to lift the waterlogged spacecraft 
from the sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Grissom nearly drowned, but was pulled to safety. He insisted  
until his death in the Apollo launch pad fire in 1967 that he'd 
done nothing wrong, although some questioned at the time -- and 
still do -- whether he bumped something or even panicked. 
</P>
<P>
	Grissom's widow, Betty, who feels certain the hatch  
malfunctioned, said last month that she hoped her husband's capsule 
would remain buried in the Atlantic. She resents not being 
consulted from the start about the salvage effort and does not want 
the spacecraft being restored by the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space 
Center, as is the plan. That's where the capsule eventually will be 
put on display. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport's success didn't come easy.  
</P>
<P>
	He and his team ran into trouble after setting sail April 19 on  
a voyage financed by the Discovery Channel. The sonar promptly 
broke down. Once fixed, it uncovered 88 possible targets in the 
24-square-mile area that Newport pinpointed based on 14 years of 
studying NASA charts and interviewing those who were there when 
Liberty Bell 7 went down. 
</P>
<P>
	The first target they looked at with the camera-equipped rover  
ended up being the 7-foot titanium and aluminum capsule. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport said the team followed the capsule's corroded, broken  
heat shield up a hill. The trail of debris led them to the capsule, 
propped upright. It emerged out of the gloom as a dark shape; 
Newport thought at first it was airplane wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember saying, 'Oh, my God, I can't believe it. That's it.  
We found it. This is it,' '' he said. ``There was a lot of shaking 
hands and slapping each other on the back and just congratulating 
each other and just staring in disbelief at this spacecraft in 
front of us, us being the first ones to see it since 1961.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newport, 47, had made two previous attempts to find the capsule.  
The former space station worker did not have sophisticated enough 
equipment or enough time on his first two tries in 1992 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was really a difficult thing to find,'' he said. ``If you  
could see what the terrain is like down there, you could understand 
this capsule, had it fallen somewhere else, could easily have been 
obscured from the sonar and we may not have seen it at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to understand,'' he continued, ``what we did was find  
something in water half a mile deeper than the Titanic and it's 
smaller than one of the Titanic's boilers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two cameras and a tape recorder that sank with the capsule could  
shed light on why the hatch blew open too soon -- one of the biggest 
mysteries of American space flight. It's doubtful, however, the 
film could be salvaged after so long underwater. 
</P>
<P>
	The hatch almost certainly would hold the answer. Newport  
estimates the hatch could be as much as a mile from Liberty Bell 7; 
he plans to spend a day looking for it when he returns for the 
capsule. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Newport and his team can recover the spacecraft and rover  
and search for the hatch, they must obtain another submersible like 
the one that sank Saturday. That could take several weeks, said 
Mike Quattrone, senior vice president for the Discovery Channel, 
which is filming the expedition for a documentary to be broadcast 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are absolutely ecstatic,'' Quattrone said. ``When he gets  
back, I want to find out what kind of lucky charm he's carrying. To 
do this on the first dive is absolutely unheard of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the record, Newport's lucky charm is a stuffed lamb, one of  
his dog's favorite toys. It's on the ocean floor attached to the 
rover that sank, so Newport will have to wait a while before he 
gets it back.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Attends Press Dinner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a year in which he was impeached and his  
life's most intimate moments were exposed to the public, a night 
out with the White House press corps wouldn't seem to be President 
Clinton's ideal evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday evening, though, Clinton put aside any lingering  
bitterness and cracked a few jokes at the annual White House 
Correspondents Association dinner at a Washington hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton showed up late enough to miss the presentation of an  
award to Newsweek's Michael Isikoff, a reporter who dedicated the 
past year to unearthing the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Instead, the 
president came in time to hear the jokes of MSNBC anchor Brian 
Williams, master of ceremonies for the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams poked fun at Washington's media elite, telling the  
audience that The Washington Post was late to the event because it 
has been ``going out to dinner on the same story since 1974,'' a 
reference to its breaking much of the Watergate scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams also took shots at political leaders, frequently  
mocking Vice President Al Gore for his claim that he invented the 
Internet. Clinton took the podium and responded, saying that Gore, 
who attended the Kentucky Derby on Saturday, never claimed he sired 
the winning horse. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton then poked fun at the press, telling the crowd that  
veteran reporter Helen Thomas of United Press International was 
upset at a proposed move in the White House briefing room because 
she remembered the last time it moved -- when the capital changed 
from Philadelphia to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, who later spoke seriously about the situation in  
Kosovo, joked with the assembled media about war coverage. He asked 
them to imagine the effects the 24-hour media would have had on 
other wars. The sub-headline on a story about President Lincoln's 
Gettysburg Address? President ``does not offer exit strategy.'' How 
about Gen. Douglas MacArthur's promise to return to the 
Philippines? MacArthur ``does not set clear timetable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the president and the dinner audience were entertained by  
singer Aretha Franklin.

<HEADLINE>  Elway Rode Big Drive to Greatness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Brian Brennan was shaking. So was Cleveland  
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The scoreboard towering over the Dawg Pound read:  
</P>
<P>
	Broncos 13, Browns 20. Time remaining: 5:32.  
</P>
<P>
	Brennan had just given Cleveland the lead over Denver with a  
stunning 48-yard touchdown reception in the 1986 AFC championship 
game. And when the Broncos' return team botched the ensuing 
kickoff, Denver was pinned inside its 2-yard line -- 98 yards from a 
tying TD. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right then,'' Brennan said the other day. ``I'm thinking, it's  
a done deal. We're finally going to the Super Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 80,000 fans and a nationwide television audience thought  
the same thing. For Denver to tie, quarterback John Elway would 
have to take his team the length of a muddy field into the teeth of 
a strong Lake Erie wind, fighting rabid fans and one of the 
league's top defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	No shot. Game over. At long last, Cleveland had a spot in the  
Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	And Brennan's TD had put them there.  
</P>
<P>
	``I remember standing with (backup quarterback) Gary  
Danielson,'' he said. ``There we were, two guys from Detroit, and 
we were going to the Super Bowl. We were hugging and I was thinking 
that like ``The Catch'' Dwight Clark made for San Francisco, I had 
made ``The Catch'' to put us in the Super Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, though, had other plans. And during the next five minutes  
he would lead the Broncos on a 15-play, 98-yard odyssey that would 
become known as ``The Drive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver tied the score and the Broncos won in overtime to put  
Elway in his first Super Bowl. And of the great moments in a career 
Elway closed Sunday with his retirement, none defined him more than 
``The Drive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland lost to the Broncos in the AFC title game again the  
next year, partly because of ``The Fumble,'' and again in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``The Drive'' and Elway still haunt Cleveland.  
</P>
<P>
	Mention ``The Drive'' to a Browns fan, and you may get punched  
in the nose. It seems everyone here remembers where they were on 
Jan 11, 1987, when in a five-minute span Elway, the quarterback who 
couldn't win the big one, became Elway, the comeback quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	It figures, too. Just when Cleveland is making its greatest  
comeback with a return to the NFL this year, Elway isn't coming 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Elway, unequivocally, is the best clutch player ever to  
play the game,'' Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Time hasn't eased the pain of ``The Drive'' much for Brennan. He  
still takes a deep breath and stares blankly as he begins reliving 
it for the zillionth time. But before starting, he makes a few 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were a better team,'' he said. ``And Elway just took it  
away. He did everything right on that drive. He still had to make 
the passes. He still had to execute the plays. He could do no wrong 
on that drive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Drive'' began inconspicuously with an Elway incompletion,  
and the Broncos had to burn a timeout and convert a third-and-2 on 
the first series to avoid punting. 
</P>
<P>
	Four plays later, Elway had the Broncos on the Cleveland 40 for  
the two-minute warning. Following an incompletion, the Browns -- for 
the only time on the drive -- put some pressure on Elway and sacked 
him for an 8-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``We finally got to him,'' said Brennan. ``I still think we were  
in a prevent defense too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Third-and-18.  
</P>
<P>
	Here's where it gets really painful for Brennan and Browns fans.  
</P>
<P>
	With Cleveland Stadium fans roaring, Elway in the shotgun and  
the Broncos' offensive line unable to hear a thing, Denver center 
Billy Bryan snapped the ball a count early. 
</P>
<P>
	As wide receiver Steve Watson came in motion, the ball hit him  
in the hip as he crossed in front of Elway. The ball bounced wildly 
and Elway was somehow able to one-hand it before firing a 20-yard 
pass between two defenders to Mark Jackson for a first down. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was when I felt like it was just meant to be,'' said  
Brennan. ``And somehow he got the ball in there with guys right in 
Jackson's face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 14-yard pass and Elway's 9-yard scramble put the ball at the  
5. On third-and-1, Elway sidesteppped a defender, and threaded the 
ball through heavy traffic to a sliding Jackson, tying the score. 
The Broncos would win in OT on Rich Karlis' 33-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	From his vantage point, Brennan saw the ball make it through a  
labyrinth of Browns arms and hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``That TD pass to Mark Jackson that tied it?'' he said. ``I  
think (defensive tackle) Carl Hairston might have even tipped it. 
And (cornerback) Mark Harper was right there diving and . . .'' 
</P>
<P>
	No Browns fan or player has more of a reason to hold a grudge  
against Elway than Brennan. He doesn't. But rarely does a day pass 
that he doesn't think about what might have been if ``The Drive'' 
hadn't trumped his TD on a play called, ``Y option, X smash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I catch the pass, I'm catching a lot of other things with it  
here in Cleveland,'' he said. ``I'll tell you this, my name would 
be known in a lot more households than it is today. I guess when I 
caught it, maybe I should have run around a little bit and taken 
some time off the clock.''

	Broncos 13, Browns 20. Time remaining: 5:32.  
</P>
<P>
	Brennan had just given Cleveland the lead over Denver with a  
stunning 48-yard touchdown reception in the 1986 AFC championship 
game. And when the Broncos' return team botched the ensuing 
kickoff, Denver was pinned inside its 2-yard line -- 98 yards from a 
tying TD. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right then,'' Brennan said the other day. ``I'm thinking, it's  
a done deal. We're finally going to the Super Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 80,000 fans and a nationwide television audience thought  
the same thing. For Denver to tie, quarterback John Elway would 
have to take his team the length of a muddy field into the teeth of 
a strong Lake Erie wind, fighting rabid fans and one of the 
league's top defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	No shot. Game over. At long last, Cleveland had a spot in the  
Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	And Brennan's TD had put them there.  
</P>
<P>
	``I remember standing with (backup quarterback) Gary  
Danielson,'' he said. ``There we were, two guys from Detroit, and 
we were going to the Super Bowl. We were hugging and I was thinking 
that like ``The Catch'' Dwight Clark made for San Francisco, I had 
made ``The Catch'' to put us in the Super Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, though, had other plans. And during the next five minutes  
he would lead the Broncos on a 15-play, 98-yard odyssey that would 
become known as ``The Drive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver tied the score and the Broncos won in overtime to put  
Elway in his first Super Bowl. And of the great moments in a career 
Elway closed Sunday with his retirement, none defined him more than 
``The Drive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland lost to the Broncos in the AFC title game again the  
next year, partly because of ``The Fumble,'' and again in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``The Drive'' and Elway still haunt Cleveland.  
</P>
<P>
	Mention ``The Drive'' to a Browns fan, and you may get punched  
in the nose. It seems everyone here remembers where they were on 
Jan 11, 1987, when in a five-minute span Elway, the quarterback who 
couldn't win the big one, became Elway, the comeback quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	It figures, too. Just when Cleveland is making its greatest  
comeback with a return to the NFL this year, Elway isn't coming 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Elway, unequivocally, is the best clutch player ever to  
play the game,'' Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Time hasn't eased the pain of ``The Drive'' much for Brennan. He  
still takes a deep breath and stares blankly as he begins reliving 
it for the zillionth time. But before starting, he makes a few 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were a better team,'' he said. ``And Elway just took it  
away. He did everything right on that drive. He still had to make 
the passes. He still had to execute the plays. He could do no wrong 
on that drive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Drive'' began inconspicuously with an Elway incompletion,  
and the Broncos had to burn a timeout and convert a third-and-2 on 
the first series to avoid punting. 
</P>
<P>
	Four plays later, Elway had the Broncos on the Cleveland 40 for  
the two-minute warning. Following an incompletion, the Browns -- for 
the only time on the drive -- put some pressure on Elway and sacked 
him for an 8-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``We finally got to him,'' said Brennan. ``I still think we were  
in a prevent defense too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Third-and-18.  
</P>
<P>
	Here's where it gets really painful for Brennan and Browns fans.  
</P>
<P>
	With Cleveland Stadium fans roaring, Elway in the shotgun and  
the Broncos' offensive line unable to hear a thing, Denver center 
Billy Bryan snapped the ball a count early. 
</P>
<P>
	As wide receiver Steve Watson came in motion, the ball hit him  
in the hip as he crossed in front of Elway. The ball bounced wildly 
and Elway was somehow able to one-hand it before firing a 20-yard 
pass between two defenders to Mark Jackson for a first down. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was when I felt like it was just meant to be,'' said  
Brennan. ``And somehow he got the ball in there with guys right in 
Jackson's face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 14-yard pass and Elway's 9-yard scramble put the ball at the  
5. On third-and-1, Elway sidesteppped a defender, and threaded the 
ball through heavy traffic to a sliding Jackson, tying the score. 
The Broncos would win in OT on Rich Karlis' 33-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	From his vantage point, Brennan saw the ball make it through a  
labyrinth of Browns arms and hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``That TD pass to Mark Jackson that tied it?'' he said. ``I  
think (defensive tackle) Carl Hairston might have even tipped it. 
And (cornerback) Mark Harper was right there diving and . . .'' 
</P>
<P>
	No Browns fan or player has more of a reason to hold a grudge  
against Elway than Brennan. He doesn't. But rarely does a day pass 
that he doesn't think about what might have been if ``The Drive'' 
hadn't trumped his TD on a play called, ``Y option, X smash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I catch the pass, I'm catching a lot of other things with it  
here in Cleveland,'' he said. ``I'll tell you this, my name would 
be known in a lot more households than it is today. I guess when I 
caught it, maybe I should have run around a little bit and taken 
some time off the clock.''

<HEADLINE> Is End of Bull Market Run Near? / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Even if the bull market in stocks remains as  
healthy as ever, analysts worry that many aggressive investors are 
headed for a painful letdown. 
</P>
<P>
	It defies reason, they say, to expect the market averages to  
keep climbing in the future as fast as they have in the recent 
past, fresh from four consecutive years of 20 percent-plus gains. 
</P>
<P>
	While the stock-price indexes keep gaining ground, sudden  
changes in trends within the bull market can still take a heavy 
toll on ``momentum'' investors who like to own the hottest stocks 
of the day, or on day traders playing the market through the 
screens of personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mean to imply that the bull market is coming to an  
end, but investors must lower their expectations for market 
returns,'' says H. Vernon Winters, chief investment officer at 
Mellon Private Asset Management. 
</P>
<P>
	``Individuals are enraptured with stocks,'' Winters said in a  
luncheon speech to the Estate Planning Council of New York City 
last week. After taking a recent look at some establishments where 
the customers were day-trading stocks, Winters concluded, ``this is 
going to end very badly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wild market,'' adds Yale Hirsch, an Old Tappan, N.J.,  
adviser who has published the newsletter Smart Money and the annual 
Stock Trader's Almanac for more than 25 years. ``A shift by a 
fraction of a percent of the money at work can send some stocks 
flying and others plunging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since the bull market took off on its latest run, in 1995,  
analysts and money managers have warned repeatedly that stocks 
could not keep up the pace they were setting indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the market has chalked up one year after another of  
powerful gains, their warnings have been drowned out by the roar of 
the bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it time to adjust expectations for future returns upward?  
Absolutely not,'' says Gus Sauter, who oversees the hugely popular 
index funds at the Vanguard Group in Valley Forge, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Half of the stock market gains over the past 15 years are due  
to increases in price-earnings ratios,'' Sauter says in a current 
report to Vanguard investors. ``So the only way to achieve future 
gains of the same magnitude is to have further dramatic increases 
in P-E ratios, or valuation levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, valuations are higher than they have ever been, so  
it's hard to make a compelling case that we're going to get any 
substantial increases in valuations from here. 
</P>
<P>
	``If current valuation levels remain intact, then future stock  
market returns can come from only two sources: Earnings growth and 
dividends. Earnings have typically grown at about 6 percent per 
year, and the current dividend yield is less than 1.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``So a reasonable estimate of returns over the next decade is 8  
percent annually, and that's assuming that valuation levels don't 
decline, which they very well could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Winters said, ``Stock prices are very high, but  
conditions are really wonderful. Innovation, mainly in the form of 
technology, is allowing the U.S. economy to grow much faster than 
anyone thought possible. We expect continued growth, low inflation, 
and interest rates remaining low. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem I have is valuation. I love the Internet, but is  
it really that easy to make money? I think large U.S. growth stocks 
are perhaps the most overpriced asset in the world at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winters concluded, ``We think that the bull market will  
continue, but it is in a maturing phase.''

<HEADLINE> Dole Takes Centrist Gun Control View </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- A Republican quiz: In seven minutes or  
less, explain why you should be the party's presidential nominee 
instead of George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight GOP candidates faced that test Sunday night in speeches to  
New Hampshire party leaders. The Texas governor, meanwhile, 
remained at home in Austin -- unwilling to risk his front-runner 
status. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole answered with a challenge to the National Rifle  
Association on gun control, promising to be a tough-on-crime 
president ``no matter what the special interests say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rival Steve Forbes replied that the country must ``resist the  
temptation to enact new laws'' in response to tragedies such as the 
school shooting in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks were made at a dinner billed as the party's first  
major event of the 2000 campaign in this first-in-the-nation 
primary state. Candidates were given seven minutes to speak, with a 
band enforcing the time limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Three likely candidates stayed away: Arizona Sen. John McCain,  
commentator Pat Buchanan and Bush. McCain was celebrating his son's 
13th birthday; Buchanan was campaigning in Arizona; Bush has 
refused to campaign outside his state until the legislative session 
ends later this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Many activists who attended the kickoff questioned or criticized  
Bush's decision to pass up the event, but most predicted it would 
not change his front-runner status. 
</P>
<P>
	For the rest of the field, the gathering offered a chance to  
shine outside Bush's shadow. Their goal is to emerge as alternative 
pick should he falter. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole's was the boldest attempt at creating news and drawing  
attention to her campaign. Wearing a clip-on microphone, the former 
American Red Cross president stood several feet from the podium -- 
spinning on her high heels to address the crowd that surrounded 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she supports the continuation of the assault-weapons  
ban, elimination of bullets that pierce bulletproof vests and full 
federal funding of instant background checks for gun buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you need an AK-47 (assault rifle) to defend your  
family,'' she said, receiving a smattering of polite applause. The 
reception was even cooler when Mrs. Dole, ranked second in most GOP 
presidential polls, said she supported child safety locks on 
handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	One person in the crowd booed. Few applauded.  
</P>
<P>
	Aides say they were not troubled by the reaction because Mrs.  
Dole is trying to expand the GOP's base by targeting moderate 
voters, not party regulars. President Clinton adopted a similar 
approach on gun control in 1996 to court moderate and independent 
voters, particularly women. 
</P>
<P>
	The other GOP candidates found other ways to set themselves  
apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle argued that he deserves the  
nomination. ``Who has been fighting for your values and your 
families for over 20 years?'' he asked. ``Who has the experience 
when it comes to foreign policy and who has been tested and has the 
courage to lead this great country of ours?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Kasich of Ohio portrayed himself as the candidate who  
would ease ``the frustrations of everyday working people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith, a native son with little chance of  
winning the nomination, bragged that he had voted to remove Clinton 
from office and criticized Republicans who didn't.

<HEADLINE>  Grissom's Mercury Capsule Located </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Lost at sea for 38 years, astronaut  
Gus Grissom's Mercury capsule was found over the weekend by an 
underwater salvage team that had been searching for the spacecraft 
300 miles offshore. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty Bell 7 is still 3 miles deep in the Atlantic.  
</P>
<P>
	The cable to a remotely operated rover used to identify and  
photograph the capsule snapped in the rough sea Saturday night and 
the rover sank. The salvagers are returning to Port Canaveral for 
new equipment and will have to wait at least a few weeks before 
going back to recover the spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	But at least they know now where it is and they're thrilled  
about Saturday's discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks to be in beautiful condition and certainly capable of  
being recovered,'' expedition leader Curt Newport said Sunday by 
phone from the ship, the Needham Tide. 
</P>
<P>
	The only U.S. spacecraft ever lost following a successful  
mission, the capsule is still shiny in spots with an intact window 
and the name ``Liberty Bell 7'' clearly printed beneath it. Even 
the fake crack that was painted on the capsule to replicate the 
real Liberty Bell is still visible, as are the singe marks left by 
the explosives that blew out the hatch following splashdown on July 
21, 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty Bell 7 sank following Grissom's successful 15-minute  
suborbital flight -- the nation's second manned space flight. The 
explosive bolts that blow open the hatch detonated prematurely, and 
helicopter rescuers were unable to lift the waterlogged spacecraft 
from the sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Grissom nearly drowned, but was pulled to safety. He insisted  
until his death in the Apollo launch pad fire in 1967 that he'd 
done nothing wrong, although some questioned at the time -- and 
still do -- whether he bumped something or even panicked. 
</P>
<P>
	Grissom's widow, Betty, who feels certain the hatch  
malfunctioned, said last month that she hoped her husband's capsule 
would remain buried in the Atlantic. She resents not being 
consulted from the start about the salvage effort and does not want 
the spacecraft being restored by the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space 
Center, as is the plan. That's where the capsule eventually will be 
put on display. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport's success didn't come easy.  
</P>
<P>
	He and his team ran into trouble after setting sail April 19 on  
a voyage financed by the Discovery Channel. The sonar promptly 
broke down. Once fixed, it uncovered 88 possible targets in the 
24-square-mile area that Newport pinpointed based on 14 years of 
studying NASA charts and interviewing those who were there when 
Liberty Bell 7 went down. 
</P>
<P>
	The first target they looked at with the camera-equipped rover  
ended up being the 7-foot titanium and aluminum capsule. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport said the team followed the capsule's corroded, broken  
heat shield up a hill. The trail of debris led them to the capsule, 
propped upright. It emerged out of the gloom as a dark shape; 
Newport thought at first it was airplane wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember saying, 'Oh, my God, I can't believe it. That's it.  
We found it. This is it,' '' he said. ``There was a lot of shaking 
hands and slapping each other on the back and just congratulating 
each other and just staring in disbelief at this spacecraft in 
front of us, us being the first ones to see it since 1961.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newport, 47, had made two previous attempts to find the capsule.  
The former space station worker did not have sophisticated enough 
equipment or enough time on his first two tries in 1992 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was really a difficult thing to find,'' he said. ``If you  
could see what the terrain is like down there, you could understand 
this capsule, had it fallen somewhere else, could easily have been 
obscured from the sonar and we may not have seen it at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to understand,'' he continued, ``what we did was find  
something in water half a mile deeper than the Titanic and it's 
smaller than one of the Titanic's boilers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two cameras and a tape recorder that sank with the capsule could  
shed light on why the hatch blew open too soon -- one of the biggest 
mysteries of American space flight. It's doubtful, however, the 
film could be salvaged after so long underwater. 
</P>
<P>
	The hatch almost certainly would hold the answer. Newport  
estimates the hatch could be as much as a mile from Liberty Bell 7; 
he plans to spend a day looking for it when he returns for the 
capsule. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Newport and his team can recover the spacecraft and rover  
and search for the hatch, they must obtain another submersible like 
the one that sank Saturday. That could take several weeks, said 
Mike Quattrone, senior vice president for the Discovery Channel, 
which is filming the expedition for a documentary to be broadcast 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are absolutely ecstatic,'' Quattrone said. ``When he gets  
back, I want to find out what kind of lucky charm he's carrying. To 
do this on the first dive is absolutely unheard of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the record, Newport's lucky charm is a stuffed lamb, one of  
his dog's favorite toys. It's on the ocean floor attached to the 
rover that sank, so Newport will have to wait a while before he 
gets it back.

	Captive Soldiers Reach Freedom  
</P>
<P>
	RAMSTEIN, Germany (AP) -- Three American servicemen arrived at a  
U.S. military base in Germany today, ending a month of captivity in 
Yugoslavia. Dressed in Army fatigues, the freed soldiers were 
exuberant and appeared healthy, standing tall and walking briskly. 
But they still showed signs of the cuts and bruises they suffered 
when captured on a patrol mission along the Macedonia-Yugoslav 
border on March 31. They were escorted to Ramstein by the Rev. 
Jesse Jackson, who arranged their release in Belgrade just hours 
earlier.

	No End in Sight for Airstrikes  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Although President Clinton welcomed  
Yugoslavia's dramatic release today of three U.S. soldiers, his 
administration rebuffed Slobodan Milosevic's request for a pause in 
the airstrikes and for a meeting with the president until the Serb 
leader agrees to all NATO demands. ``This gesture ... of goodwill 
cannot obliterate or overcome the stench of evil and death that has 
been inflicted in those killing fields in Kosovo,'' Defense 
Secretary William Cohen said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' But the 
Russians, who have been seeking a diplomatic solution for weeks, 
won an audience with Clinton tomorrow.

Japan's economy in order to stabilize the rest of Asia. But Obuchi 
says he's doing his best and that it will take time to reverse 
Japan's worst recession in 50 years. Obuchi is making the first

	HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) -- The death toll from the sinking of a  
tourist boat rose to 13 today when a woman died in a hospital and 
divers returned to a lake and found her ex-husband's body. Their 
daughter also was among the victims. The amphibious vehicle of 
World War II vintage -- called a ``duck'' because it travels both on

yesterday while passengers panicked and scrambled for life 
preservers. Twenty-one people were on board, including the driver.

the April 20 massacre. The gathering at the scenic Red Rocks 
amphitheater comes a day before they head back to class at nearby 
Chatfield High School, considered a rival. Columbine, still a 
massive crime scene, won't be reopened at least until fall. Some

Tomorrow, students will be given lapel ribbons with blue for 
Columbine and burgundy for Chatfield, bound together in the shape

capsule was found over the weekend after it was lost at sea 38 
years ago. An underwater salvage team that had been searching for 
the spacecraft for nearly two weeks discovered the capsule. But 
Liberty Bell 7, the only U.S. spacecraft ever lost following a 
successful mission, is still 3 miles beneath the Atlantic's surface 
and about 300 miles offshore. Salvagers won't be able to recover 
the space craft for another few weeks because of problems with a

	HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) -- An amphibious tourist boat sank  
yesterday, drowning 11 people in a lake as panicked passengers 
scrambled for life preservers and nearby residents rushed to their 
boats to pluck victims from the choppy water. The open-air, World 
War II-vintage boat sank quickly on Lake Hamilton near this popular 
tourist town. A cloth canopy may have trapped the victims as the 
wheeled craft went down less than a mile offshore, Mayor Bob Mathis 
said. A survivor, Gary Ledin, said there was little time to react.

	Clinton Attends Press Dinner  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton put aside any lingering  
bitterness and cracked a few jokes at the annual White House 
Correspondents Association dinner last night. Clinton showed up 
late enough to miss the presentation of an award to Newsweek's 
Michael Isikoff, a reporter who dedicated the past year to 
unearthing the Monica Lewinsky scandal.

	GOP Seeks Military Spending Boost  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican Rep. Robin Hayes, whose North  
Carolina district includes two major military bases, said yesterday 
that the Clinton administration has neglected defense spending and 
left the military's resources stretched too thin. In the weekly GOP 
radio address, Hayes said a smaller military has been called on to 
handle crises all over the globe, with the current action in 
Yugoslavia taking a further toll.

	NRA Takes Stand Against Gun Laws  
</P>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Charlton Heston took a defiant stand against  
gun-control laws yesterday at the National Rifle Association's 
annual meeting in Denver, saying the NRA isn't the villain in the 
Colorado school shooting. While the gun lobby held its annual 
meeting, thousands of opponents circled outside. Officials of the 
nation's largest group of gun owners -- at 2.8 million members -- 
refused to cancel the meeting despite requests from Mayor 
Wellington Webb and other local officials. ``We will not be silent 
or be told, `Do not come here, you are not welcome in your own 
land,''' Heston said.

	Duke KO'd in Livingston Race  
</P>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Former Gov. Dave Treen and state Rep. David  
Vitter qualified yesterday for a May 29 runoff to replace Bob 
Livingston in the House. Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke ran 
third. While Treen and Vitter celebrated, Duke refused to concede 
and backed off earlier statements that this would be the end of his 
political career.

<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Like high school chums with fond pasts to  
recall, former prisoners at one of Pennsylvania's oldest prisons 
returned yesterday with the jailers who once guarded for their own 
``alumni reunion.'' The first-ever such social event at the 
170-year-old, stone-walled Eastern State Prison gave all who once 
dwelled behind its foreboding walls a chance to swap stories about 
their time at the prison.

<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- A 96-year-old man shattered an age-group world  
record yesterday when he ran the 100-meter dash in 24.01 seconds. 
Erwin Jaskulski of Honolulu broke the 95-and-older age-group record 
of 38.82 seconds set by Kazuhiko Tsutsumi of Japan in 1997, said 
officials at the Punahou Relays.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Jokes with Journalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After each tumultuous turn of his presidency --  
congressional defeat, re-election, impeachment -- President Clinton 
has been known to muse about his greater role in history. This 
weekend, he sat down with 2,000 or so journalists to ponder where 
he'll be in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Raising the possibility he may have to fill out a co-op  
application in New York, where his wife is considering a run for 
the Senate, Clinton asked the crowd to imagine what he would have 
to write: 
</P>
<P>
	``Intended employment: Unknown. Expected earnings: Unknown.  
Current residence: Public housing. References: Nelson Mandela, the 
Dalai Lama, Steven Spielberg. Outstanding debts? Williams &AMP; 
Connelly, the House Democrats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The occasion for Clinton's banter Saturday evening was the 85th  
annual dinner of the White House Correspondents Association, one of 
the few times each year when the president and the journalists who 
cover him get together simply to laugh at and with one another. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton showed up late enough to miss the presentation of the  
association's Edgar Allan Poe Award to Michael Isikoff, the 
Newsweek reporter who devoted the past year to unearthing the 
Monica Lewinsky scandal. Instead, Clinton came in time to hear 
MSNBC anchor Brian Williams, master of ceremonies for the black-tie 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams poked fun at the media elite, mocking The New York  
Times, which boycotts the dinner, and telling the audience that The 
Washington Post was late to the event because it has been ``going 
out to dinner on the same story since 1974,'' a reference to its 
breaking much of the Watergate scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams also took shots at political leaders, frequently  
mocking Vice President Al Gore for his claim that he invented the 
Internet. Clinton took the podium and defending his No. 2, pointed 
out that Gore, who attended the Kentucky Derby on Saturday, never 
claimed he sired the winning horse. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton took his own friendly shots at the press, inviting the  
audience to imagine what would have happened had the 1990s media 
been around to cover other wars. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested some headlines that would have emerged: ``Paul  
Revere's warning: Too little too late?'' ``Lincoln speaks at 
Gettysburg: Fails to articulate exit strategy.'' ``MacArthur to 
Philippines: 'I Shall Return' -- Refuses to set specific 
timetable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president turned back to his own role in history. He told  
the audience that he saw a list of the top 100 news stories of the 
century compiled by the Newseum, a journalism-oriented museum in 
across the Potomac in Virginia, and noticed that ``something about 
the events of the past year'' were on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, smiling, revealed his number on the list: No. 53.  
</P>
<P>
	``No. 53! I mean, what does a guy have to do to make the top 50?  
I came in six places after the invention of plastic, for crying 
outloud. And I don't recall a year of 24-hour-a-day saturation on 
the miracle of plastic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Clinton, the first lady and the guests rose to their feet  
for a performance by singer Aretha Franklin.

<HEADLINE> Denver Fans Accept Elway's Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- It was time.  
</P>
<P>
	Although Denver Broncos' fans had dreaded the day, most  
reluctantly agreed Sunday it was time for legendary quarterback 
John Elway to leave the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not disappointed,'' said David Hill of Denver. ``I don't  
think you can ask for anything better than what he has done for 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For 16 years, Elway, 38, has been entertaining fans with pass  
after pass, heart-stopping, come-from-behind victories, jaunty runs 
into the end zone and a toothy grin. 
</P>
<P>
	And, of course, two straight Super Bowl victories.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bummer,'' said John Woodmansee of Denver, who sat on a  
bench, enjoying a quiet afternoon in Larimer Square. ``We think one 
more year, he could have done that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, he reflected, ``I guess when you're done, you're done. And  
I definitely respect that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway delayed the official announcement of his retirement  
because of the Columbine High School shootings that left a dozen 
students, a teacher and two student gunmen dead. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Elway has been troubled by injuries, including  
an arthritic left knee that probably will have to be replaced. Last 
year, he missed all or part of six games because of hamstring, back 
and rib injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	With that in mind, most fans thought it best for the future Hall  
of Famer to leave a winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Stephen Young of Denver wanted Elway to help the team to  
a third consecutive Super Bowl victory, even if he could have 
played just a few of the games. ``It's going to be tough (for the 
team next season),'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His favorite Elway memory is of The Drive in 1986, when Elway  
took the Broncos 98 yards for a tying touchdown in the final 
minutes before defeating Cleveland in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Young's wife, Leslie, said she understood Elway's decision.  
``With things the way they are in Denver, maybe it's just time,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	For Hill, favorite memories range from an Elway run that ended  
in a tackle that spun him like a helicopter in Super Bowl XXXII to 
the quarterback's community leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a professional athlete's standpoint, he's a wonderful  
role model,'' Hill said. ``I'm very happy for him and his family 
who can go on about their lives and live like you and I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Elway said he's not going anywhere. He has firm  
roots in the Denver area now, has his name on a string of auto 
dealerships and there has been speculation about a future in 
politics or broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he will be the team's biggest fan.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Colonel Faces Third Murder Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- George Marecek's eventful life has  
earned him several vivid appellations: 
</P>
<P>
	Child survivor of a Nazi concentration camp.  
</P>
<P>
	Green Beret colonel.  
</P>
<P>
	Decorated combat veteran in Korea and Vietnam.  
</P>
<P>
	Wife killer.  
</P>
<P>
	The 66-year-old Special Forces retiree has battled the last tag  
for five years, and the fight may not be finished. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been tried twice and convicted once for the 1991 murder  
of his second wife, Viparat Saewong Marecek. The first proceeding 
ended in mistrial in 1995 when one juror held out for acquittal; 
the second jury's conviction was overturned by the state Court of 
Appeals in July 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you would be safe in assuming it will be retried, but  
I can't say when,'' says prosecutor Dean Bowman. Until the state 
decides whether to pursue a third trial, Mracek must check in daily 
with a court officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't need this,'' Marecek said recently as he sat in his  
attorney's office. ``This is going on the eighth year now, and I'm 
drenched. I'm exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if you can imagine the financial and physical  
stress, not only of losing my wife, but then being hammered with 
something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors see him as anything but a victim. Even two of  
Marecek's three children have testified against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they have another trial, I'll have to testify again, and  
I'll just tell the truth ... I have to,'' says Susan Kirk, 41, 
Marecek's daughter. ``Viparat was part of my family. We were 
friends, and she trusted me. I couldn't possibly not stand up for 
her when she can't stand up for her herself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy Hicks, who prosecuted both trials, said Marecek killed his  
wife so he could collect on a life insurance policy and marry his 
Czech cousin, Hana, whom he'd met the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	``We managed to convince 23 out of 24 jurors he was guilty,''  
Hicks says. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kirk testified that her stepmother suspected Marecek was  
having an affair with Hana, whom he had visited at least twice, and 
grew concerned when he took out a new $150,000 life insurance 
policy on her in the spring of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Marecek testified that he and his father got drunk one  
day and his father confessed to making ``a big mistake,'' which 
Michael took to mean he'd killed Viparat. 
</P>
<P>
	Marecek's younger daughter, Eva Lynn, testified on his behalf.  
Despite their differences, all three siblings stay in touch. But 
Mrs. Kirk has not spoken with her father since the first day of his 
first trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``He couldn't believe I would think such a thing,'' Mrs. Kirk  
says. ``But his story of events and the preceding events didn't 
correspond with the things that I knew, the things that Viparet had 
told me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1991, George and Viparat -- his wife of nine years, whom  
he'd met in Thailand in the mid-1970s -- were vacationing at a beach 
cottage near the Cape Fear River. Marecek told investigators he 
went to the beach about mid-afternoon on June 3. His wife planned 
to go out later to check some fishing spots. They agreed he would 
start the chicken for dinner if she wasn't home when he got back. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to the cottage about 5:30 but didn't become alarmed  
at her absence until the rain started. About 8:30, he called 
police, who searched that night. 
</P>
<P>
	Marecek says he resumed the search the next day and found his  
42-year-old wife face-down and nude in the river. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical examiner said she'd drowned but that she'd also been  
struck several times with a blunt object and the blows could have 
incapacitated her before she entered the river. Investigators never 
determined where she was beaten or what happened to her clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things that struck me from the beginning was that  
when her body was found, there was nothing -- no clothes, no 
jewelry, no nothing,'' Hicks says. ``Somebody who had just 
committed a killing would not have taken that care to clean up the 
scene without planning it ahead of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case against Marecek was totally circumstantial. Deputies  
found no murder weapon, and there were no witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Two and a half years passed until Marecek was indicted, charged  
and put on trial. He served 18 months of a 30-year prison sentence 
before the appeals court overturned the conviction, ruling the 
judge had improperly allowed hearsay testimony, including that of 
Mrs. Kirk. 
</P>
<P>
	Marecek says he first tasted captivity as a 12-year-old boy. In  
1944, after his father, an underground activist who helped rescue 
downed Allied pilots, went into hiding, the Nazis sent him and his 
mother to a concentration camp at Terezin, Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
	Marecek is reluctant to discuss either prison experience. He is  
more comfortable talking about his military career. He stills wears 
his hair in a crew cut and lapses into military jargon to spell the 
name of his hometown, Dolni Poustevna -- ``.... Echo, Victor, 
November, Alpha.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Combat awards include the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Silver  
Star, the Bronze Star and three Purple Hearts. He earned the 
Distinguished Service Cross, the Army's second-highest combat 
medal, for actions during a nightime enemy attack in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	``I rallied the troops ... and I knocked out a few automatic  
weapons,'' he says matter-of-factly. 
</P>
<P>
	Marecek believes prosecutors used his combat training and 24  
years with the Special Forces to depict him as a man capable of 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always felt that my military record has been used very  
effectively against me,'' Marecek says. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorney, Gerald Beaver, agrees: ``They tried to turn that  
against him, as if that makes him a cunning, ruthless killer.''

<HEADLINE> Surgery in Womb Saves Lives of Twins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Lisa Bailey was 19 weeks pregnant with  
identical twins when her doctor in Oklahoma City darkened an 
ultrasound screen and gave her heartbreaking news: One twin was 
robbing the other of life. 
</P>
<P>
	The watery sac protecting one child had collapsed like shrink  
wrap. Inside it, movement was faint. The other fetus was big, 
active and well-cushioned in fluid. If nothing was done, chances 
were one would shrivel; the other would become overwhelmed. Mrs. 
Bailey could lose one fetus, or both. 
</P>
<P>
	The prognosis was poor.  
</P>
<P>
	Then she learned of a selective endoscopic procedure pioneered  
by Dr. Ruben Quintero, a fetal surgeon in Tampa. He used a tiny 
doll-sized optical instrument to penetrate the amniotic sac of the 
plump twin. In utero, he traced and selectively lasered culprit 
vessels that prevented the deprived twin from getting the nutrients 
needed to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven weeks later, the smaller twin had nearly caught up in  
size. One was 2 pounds 13 ounces; the other was 2 pounds 11 ounces, 
Mrs. Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent stress test showed that the twins were doing well.  
``Their little hearts are beating fine. We're so thankful,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And they're moving around like acrobats,'' added her husband,  
Keith Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
	At the University of Oklahoma, Dr. John R. Stanley III, who  
specializes in high-risk pregnancies, told the couple their options 
were few. There was a hallmark surgical technique -- selective laser 
surgery -- but he didn't know much about it. They could research it 
on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were shocked, numb,'' Mrs. Bailey said at learning her  
twins were in jeopardy. ``We waited 17 years to have children and 
we wanted our two boys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Baileys didn't have access to the Internet. So friends  
gathered the data. The couple read up. They paged Quintero. Within 
10 minutes he called them. They were on the phone with the 
perinatologist for 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Quintero canceled a trip to Venezuela. Within a few days the  
Baileys flew to Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the week was over, their fears had turned to hope -- Mrs.  
Bailey had every expectation of delivering two healthy sons in 
early July. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my miracle,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Inside her were two strong heartbeats. The bladder on the puny  
baby was working, refilling the dry amniotic sac. Three liters of 
fluid had been drained from the sac of the larger twin, fluid that 
wouldn't return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so glad we went to Florida,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	In February, when she arrived in Tampa less than five months  
pregnant, swelling and fluid buildup left Mrs. Bailey looking and 
feeling like she was eight months along. The babies were a mere six 
or seven ounces each. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't breathe,'' she said. ``It was like when you blow up  
a ball too tight,'' her husband said. 
</P>
<P>
	She credits Quintero, who works at St. Joseph's Women's  
Hospital, with saving the lives of her boys against the odds: She 
is 35 years old, a first-time mother-to-be, carrying twins, and her 
high-risk pregnancy was in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease is called twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), a  
condition affecting 10 percent of the identical twins in utero. 
</P>
<P>
	Each case has a donor twin and a recipient twin, the dichotomy  
created by an unbalanced blood flow between identical twins sharing 
a common placenta. 
</P>
<P>
	When the vascular system is healthy, the blood travels to the  
placenta via the arteries, picks up oxygen and nutrients and 
returns to each fetus via the veins. 
</P>
<P>
	In diseased cases, the vascular systems are altered. Some  
arteries deliver the blood of the donor twin to the placenta, but 
the veins return the blood to the recipient twin instead of the 
donor. 
</P>
<P>
	Without surgery, both babies could die. Previously, surgeons  
severed all vessels crossing the membrane dividing the amniotic 
sacs to stop the piracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Quintero believed there had to be another way, a way to pinpoint  
problem vessels and sever only those. Such a selective technique 
would leave intact other vessels essential to fetal survival, 
vessels that carry oxygen and nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
	Quintero built on the work of Dr. Julian DeLia, a fetal surgeon  
from Milwaukee, and others before him who took on the task of 
trying to surgically intervene in similar cases of aberrant 
identical twin development in utero. 
</P>
<P>
	And he came up with a selective endoscopic procedure to operate  
within the womb. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Quintero pioneeded endoscopic fetal surgery. He was the  
first person in the history of surgery to operate on a human fetus 
through an endoscope,'' said Dr. Roberto Romero, chief of the 
perinatology branch of the National Institute of Child Health and 
Human Development in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a landmark advance,'' Romero said. In earlier  
procedures Romero said a fetus was accessed through an abdominal 
incision and an open uterus creating a high rate of complications. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Frank Manning, a Bronx, N.Y., obstetrician-gynecologist  
specializing in maternal-fetal health, said Quintero's work wasn't 
scientifically original, but added that the Florida surgeon 
developed his own variations and a better way to find vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	``I claim originality,'' said Quintero. ``I spent three years  
trying to find a way to find the vessels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quintero used miniature instruments: an endoscope smaller than a  
pencil to look into the womb, and a needle about the size of one 
used to draw blood to sheath the endoscope. 
</P>
<P>
	The precision and clarity of the pictures transmitted through  
the endoscope were so detailed Quintero could see everything from 
tiny fingers to minute organs. 
</P>
<P>
	Painstakingly, the surgeon tracked each blood vessel and blunted  
certain ones using the minimally invasive procedure. It left a tiny 
incision a bandage was able to cover. 
</P>
<P>
	``With previous techniques, there was nothing that clearly says  
these are the vessels that allow blood sharing and these don't,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The technique changed the odds of survival.  
</P>
<P>
	``It went from almost 100 percent likelihood of losing the  
pregnancy if nothing were done, to at least 80 percent chance one 
twin would survive and 50 percent chance the two would survive,'' 
Quintero said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The important thing is for people to know there is hope that  
we can stop the disease, that we can turn this around,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Quintero came to Tampa in October 1996 from Wayne State  
University in Detroit. He introduced his technique four years 
earlier at the university's Hutzel Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bailey has had sonograms weekly since Quintero performed  
the procedure and said ``each time it's just gotten better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Terminating the pregnancy was not an option,'' explained her  
husband, a 41-year-old businessman. ``Sacrificing one for the other 
wasn't either,'' added Mrs. Bailey, a representative for a 
California fragrance company. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have passed the first threshold and are hoping for a  
storybook ending,'' said Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
	The names of the babies? Dillon and Ryan. The Baileys had the  
names picked out from the start. Ironically, the first letters also 
stand for donor and recipient.

<HEADLINE> Silent Classics To Be Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hundreds of silent-movie classics including  
``The Phantom of the Opera,'' ``The King of Kings'' and rare 
footage of W.C. Fields are heading to the auction block. 
</P>
<P>
	The prints of more than 1,500 films come from the Silent Movie  
Showcase in Hollywood, the country's only movie theater dedicated 
to silent films, which closed in January 1997 after a gunman killed 
the theater's owner, Lawrence Austin. 
</P>
<P>
