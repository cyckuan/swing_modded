CHAMBLEE'S JUST HORSING AROUND 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ It wasn't exactly a grand arrival for Brandel
Chamblee when he made his noontime drive up Magnolia Lane last
weekend. He nearly missed the entrance and tiny guard house several
hundred yards from the Augusta National clubhouse at the end of the
roadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sort of snuck up on me,'' said the Texan who qualified for
the 63d Masters by winning the Greater Vancouver Open last August.
``I almost drove right by the entrance.''
</P>
<P>
   After Chamblee got his bearings, he approached the guard house
to show his calling card _ his PGA Tour money clip.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I don't need to see that. What's your name?' ''
Chamblee related. ``I told him, and he said, `Go on in.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't ask for an ID or anything like that. Very trusting.
I thought, `Man, I'm going to ask my buddies to give that a shot.'
I was dropped off by my wife, so I just walked into the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `This was pretty easy.' I walked in, and I thought
we'd have lockers. You don't. It's just a small, intimate
environment in the locker room. They put my shoes in Jack Baker's
locker. I know Jack. I thought there might be a bottle of scotch in
there, knowing Jack. I went out and had lunch by myself under the
oak tree overlooking the 18th green.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamblee, who grew up riding cutting horses and roping calves on
an Irving, Texas, ranch that is now the site of a Tournament
Players Club, usually spends Masters weekend doing his taxes and
hosting a party at his home outside Phoenix to watch the tournament
on TV.
</P>
<P>
   He certainly was having more fun Thursday, when he posted an
opening round of 69, 3 under par, to tie for the lead with Davis
Love, Scott McCarron, and Nick Price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the course played pretty much the way I expected it
to play,'' said Chamblee. ``I came here early and played a number
of rounds on the golf course. So I felt comfortable. I thought the
course played pretty similar to way it played Tuesday and
Wednesday. They do a good job keeping the greens consistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know how I was going to handle the first day. You
never know how you're going to feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamblee, who went to the University of Texas, was asked how
riding cutting horses compares to the excitement of Amen Corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very similar when you get your foot caught in the saddle
and you fall off,'' said Chamblee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to ride competitively, but a couple horses reared up
and fell over on me. When you ride horses, you're going to get
hurt. I never got hurt playing golf. So it was an easy choice. I
still love horses though, and I hope to get one soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamblee certainly endeared himself to the membership of this
very private club.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear how it's a pretty tight ship,'' said Chamblee. ``It
is. Essentially it's a pretty tight club 51 weeks out of the year.
They open it one week. So that's the intriguing thing about this
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to see it, and they can't get in here but one
week of the year. I don't know anybody who wouldn't love to be a
member of this golf club. But they have their club and it's an
exclusive membership. Some people frown on that, and some people
say, `You have a right to do that.' Personally, I think this is a
wonderful place, and I'd love to be a member here. Who wouldn't?''
</P>

   Sergio Garcia is golf's newest golden boy. The 19-year-old
Spaniard, who won the British Amateur a year ago, plays out The
Golf Club of Georgia in Atlanta and may turn professional following
the Masters. He qualified for the Mediterranean Open on the Eurpean
PGA Tour at the age of 14, and since 1995 he has played in 80
amateur and professional events in 20 countries. He was a
semifinalist in the US Amateur last year at Oak Hill. He says his
decision to go pro is on hold until Monday. ``I can't tell you for
sure,'' Garcia said. ``That's a thing I have to just be with my dad
on, with all of my family after this tournament. I can't tell you
for sure.'' Is it because of the Ryder Cup? ``I'm not thinking
about the Ryder Cup at this moment,'' he said. ``Once I turn pro, I
want to make my European card. If I can get on the Ryder Cup team,
it would be perfect. But I'm just going step by step, and we'll see
how it goes.'' . . . Fred Couples on the Tiger Woods-David Duval
rivalry: ``You know Tiger Woods can do anything. You know David
Duval can do anything. They're just totally different. They play
differently. Tiger plays with a boatload of emotion, and when he's
going strong he's pumping his fists and he's hitting it farther.
David hits it the same every single time, and that's how they both
play to their strong points.'' . . . Joe Durant, who won the
Western Open to qualify for the Masters, won Wednesday's par 3
tournament and realized no winner of that event has ever won the
Masters. ``I'm the sacrificial lamb,'' quipped Durant. ``I came out
and had fun. I birdied 2, 3, 4, and 5 without thinking about it.''
He shot 87 Thursday. Duval took the right approach in the par 3,
shooting a plus-14 round of 41 and permitting caddies to hit shots
for him . . . Paul Runyon, who played with tournament founder Bobby
Jones in the inaugural Masters in 1934, returned to participate in
the par 3 tournament, and he and his wife Bernice were given a
shuttle ride from their hotel to the course. The driver left them
at the wrong gate; so here was 90-year-old Runyon lugging a heavy
golf bag up Washington Road to the clubhouse. Fortunately someone
stopped to give them a ride. Runyon played in a threesome with Tom
Watson and Ben Crenshaw in the par 3 . . . Isn't this 1999? Some
people at Augusta National seem to still be living in the 1930s.
There is a copy of the front page of the Augusta Chronicle from
July 15, 1931, framed and hanging in a men's room. The banner
headline proclaims, ``Bobby Jones to Build His Ideal Golf Course on
Berckman's place.'' Nothing wrong with that, but tucked on the
bottom left of the page is a crude attempt at humor under the
heading ``Hambone's Meditations.'' A black cartoon character named
``Hambone'' is sitting on a wall saying, ``You jes cain' do good
work en hurry . . . Dey might apt to ketch you in de' lie. What you
fixes up right quick!'' It's so tasteless you wonder why it could
be left hanging there all these years _ and you have to wonder
whether Woods has seen it.

   Caddie Mike ``Fluff'' Cowan, who was fired by Woods March 8,
signed on with Jim Furyk and worked the Masters. ``I want him to be
my full-time caddie, and I want him to be happy working for me,''
said Furyk. ``He's one of the best caddies out here. I was
fortunate when I needed a caddie that he was available and he
wanted to work for me.'' Before they teed off in the final grouping
Thursday, Cowan said, ``I hope it's a permanent job. We'll see.'' .
. . There were separate pretournament meetings laced with anguish
involving golf writers' associations based in the United States and
the United Kingdom. The subject was the price of a single room at
the Sheraton Boston the week of the Ryder Cup at The Country Club.
The going rate is $237 per night before taxes. The rub is that
rooms at nearby hotels are topping $400 and the Sheraton Boston
tried to get out of its contract with the writers. PGA of America
representatives said they'd sue to hold the hotel to its contract.
There will be courtesy transportation to and from The Country Club
so visitors won't have to rent cars, but residents should be
concerned about what is happening to the image of Boston, which is
becoming known as ``Ripoff City'' _ and the Ryder Cup is still more
than five months down the road . . . Then there is this story
regarding price gouging at the Masters: According to the Augusta
Chronicle, a man named Love was in the Medical College of Georgia
Hospital after being critically injured in his hometown of
Moultrie. His wife reserved a room at a Holiday Inn to be near him,
but the room rates went from $59 to $200 a day because it was
Masters week. ``It's a touch-and-go, critical situation with my
husband,'' she told the Chronicle. ``It's not right. The sports
part of it has overshadowed anything else, and we don't think
that's right.'' She and her sister-in-law had to vacate because
they couldn't afford the Masters rates . . . The 60th PGA Senior
Championship is this week at PGA National GC in North Palm Beach,
Fla., and 20 international players representing 10 countries are in
the field. Hale Irwin is defending champion . . . The PGA of
America will honor Judy Rankin with its First Lady of Golf award .
. . This is the final year the Masters will extend invitations to
players who have won on the PGA Tour in the previous 12 months. The
two new criteria state that the top 40 money-winners on the Tour,
instead of the top 30, will get in and the top 50 players on the
season-ending World Golf Rankings will receive invitations. ``We
wanted the most consistent players over the balance of the year,''
said Will Nicholson, chairman of the competition committee.

AWARD SPEAKS TO SHERIDAN'S TALENT 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bob Sheridan was not feeling well but it didn't
matter, even though his idea of not feeling well was like most
everything else about him _ larger than life.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime international broadcasting voice of championship
boxing had suffered his third heart attack two days earlier and had
had an emergency angioplasty performed in a Las Vegas hospital, but
this was Big Fight Night, so he knew where he had to go.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan was going to the place where his heart has been for
more than 25 years. He was going to the fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably wasn't the smartest thing I ever did, but if this was
it, I wanted to get in one more big fight,'' said Sheridan, who was
presented the Sam Taub Award from the Professional Boxing Writers
Association Friday night in New York as its broadcaster of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ram K. Singh, who performed the emergency operation,
protested loudly, but not as loudly as Sheridan, who talks for a
living and thus had the advantage. He also had a 7-foot-2-inch,
500-pound bodyguard named Pancho who made it clear to Singh that
they were going to go to the arena to broadcast a fight between
Evander Holyfield and Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   So off they went, Sheridan, Singh, Pancho, an ambulance, and a
ringside defibrillator just in case. For six endless hours on June
8, 1997, Sheridan called the action of one fight after another as
Singh sat nervously by his side, handing him water and monitoring
his vital signs. This would be the night Tyson bit off a chunk of
Holyfield's ear, but even with blood dripping onto his shoulder,
Holyfield was not in as difficult straits as the 320-pound
heavyweight broadcaster sitting at ringside trying to explain to
the world what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Tyson was disqualified and all hell had broken
loose inside the MGM Grand Garden arena, Pancho cleared a path for
Sheridan from ringside to the ambulance. There Sheridan was given
fluids and taken back to the hospital, where the following morning
Singh did two more angioplasties. Sheridan has not missed a
broadcast since then, and he will work his 616th world title fight
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no name or voice is better known to boxing fans around
the world than Sheridan's, because the Lexington-bred former
baseball star and rodeo bull rider has done more fights in more
places watched by more people than anyone else in history. But if
you've never heard of him, you can be excused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably the most famous boxing announcer in the world not
known in the United States,'' Sheridan joked. ``Maybe that's why
this award meant so much to me. Being recognized by my peers, by
the writers who know boxing best, that's great!''
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, so is the Colonel, so called because of his rank in the
Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts, the
oldest chartered military organization in the Western Hemisphere.
His baritone is as smooth as 30-weight oil and just as valuable to
the engine that keeps boxing running _ television.
</P>
<P>
   When Sheridan calls a fight, which he has done more than 10,000
times since his first radio broadcast on WGBS in Miami of a card
promoted by Chris Dundee in the '60s, you not only know what has
happened but also why it happened, how it happened, and whether
it's likely to happen again.
</P>
<P>
   When Holyfield was destroying Tyson in their first fight,
Showtime's crew kept telling America that Tyson was starting to
come on and Holyfield was ``showing the first signs of fatigue.''
On the international broadcast, Sheridan was telling the rest of
the English-speaking world that Tyson was taking the worst beating
of his life. A round later, Tyson was on his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you wish they had erasers on microphones,'' Sheridan
said. ``We all say things we wish we hadn't. But I try to work at
the job, to talk to the fighters and their trainers and gather
information that can help me tell the listener why the things
they're seeing are happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan began doing that not long after leaving the University
of Miami, where he was ``the worst scholarship athlete in the
history of the university.'' Soon he was broadcasting Florida State
League baseball games and within a few years had graduated to doing
play-by-play for University of Miami football and the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   He became a big name in Miami, moving to local television and
doing a daily radio talk show. But it was boxing that he loved, so
he continued to do Dundee's weekly cards, calling more than 5,000
radio fights before his big break came in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a chance to do Ken Buchanan's world title fight against
Frankie Otero for Video Techniques on worldwide television because
all the New York broadcasters were off doing more important
stuff,'' Sheridan said. ``I was about 29 years old and I knew it
was my big break.''
</P>
<P>
   From that fight call, he landed a contract with Video Techniques
and two years later found himself in the Congo, calling one of the
most historic fights in boxing: the Rumble in the Jungle between
Muhammad Ali and George Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan did a call so memorable that it was the one used on the
Academy Award-winning documentary about the fight, ``When We Were
Kings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What a night that was,'' Sheridan said. ``It was everything I
love about boxing. It was a great fight with two great champions.
It was excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me boxing is the ultimate in sports _ two gladiators trying
to make the other guy's mind go blank for 10 seconds. I love it! I
love the hustle of boxing. All of sports is a hustle, but what I
love about boxing is it's so blatant about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan has been hustling, too, replacing the only broadcaster
in boxing's Hall of Fame, the late Don Dunphy, on closed-circuit
telecasts in the mid-1970s and signing on with Don King, for whom
he has broadcast every title fight since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   How, you might ask, could anyone work 26 years for the bombastic
promoter? For the affable Sheridan, it has been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never talk to Don,'' Sheridan said. ``I interview him at the
start of most of our international broadcasts because KingVision is
his network, but otherwise we seldom talk. I've been loyal to him
for 26 years and he's been loyal to me, but we don't spend a lot of
time chatting. It's a good way to do business with your boss.''
</P>
<P>
   It has paid off well enough that Sheridan recently landed a
contract to work all of US Satellite Broadcasting's cards as well
as King's shows, a schedule so heavy that he has left Massachusetts
for Las Vegas so he can be home with his wife once in a while.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hectic schedule, Sheridan knows he has not worked a
day in his life, not even on the day he risked his life to call a
fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father told me when I was young to find a job you like and
you'll never have to work a day in your life,'' the 54-year-old
Sheridan recalled. ``That's me. I still love doing this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I go to the arena it's exciting. How can you get
tired of this? I've drank in every corner of the world and known
some of the greatest fighters and fight people you could imagine.
If you don't love this job, you don't love living.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield originally was upset at the Boxing Writers Association
for awarding Lennox Lewis an ``undisputed heavyweight
championship'' belt at Friday night's dinner, but after speaking
with the organization's president, Newark Star-Ledger writer Chris
Thorne, Holyfield sent a letter congratulating Lewis and saying he
hoped that belt would be on the line in their rematch along with
the World Boxing Council one Lewis holds and the World Boxing
Association and International Boxing Federation versions Holyfield
still wears . . . Speaking of that rematch, King has asked the
Nevada State Athletic Commission to hold open Nov. 6 and Nov. 13, a
sign that it likely will be in Las Vegas . . . Reform efforts
continued in New York, where state legislators filed a bill
proposing open scoring and another calling for an extra round if a
fight ends in a draw. Gov. George Pataki said he would wait for a
report from the state athletic commission before backing any
changes in the boxing rules. But here's why they never work. The
same week, the New York commission sent former IBF junior
middleweight champion Paul Vaden home to California without a
payday after he'd flown there to fight on a card at Yonkers Raceway
against Edwin Rodriguez, a fighter approved by the commission. When
it came time for the weigh-in, the fighter who showed up was not
the Edwin Rodriguez the commission expected. He was supposed to be
a guy with a 13-3-1 record, but the one who showed up was a kid
from the Bronx who had never won in 13 fights. So the fight was
canceled and Vaden had to fly back to San Diego, about $3,000
poorer in travel expenses. What makes this worse is that the
Rodriguez the commission had approved was on a medical suspension
dating back to March 23, 1998, and could not have fought . . . The
anticipated shakeup of the Duvas' family boxing business went down
last week, but not as expected. Instead of Lou and Dino Duva buying
out the interest of deceased brother Dan Duva's wife, Kathy, Dino
took a leave and Kathy has taken over the day-to-day operation
along with Mike Boorman, Lou's son-in-law and a former publicist
who had left the company a month ago after tiring of the bickering
between the company's warring parties.

STEWART ON FAST TRACK TO STARDOM 
</HEADLINE>
 RACING NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With each race he starts, Tony Stewart is feeling more
and more at home in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series. And with each
race he finishes, it is becoming more and more apparent that the
rookie driver from Rushville, Ind., is the sport's next budding
superstar, certainly its Rookie of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   When Joe Gibbs lured Stewart away from the Indy Racing League _
which had pinned so much of its future on the local sprint car hero
_ the plan was to put him in a Busch Grand National car, get him
acclimated to stock car racing, then have him make the jump to
Winston Cup this season.
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart, much to Gibbs's surprise, has proven to be more
than just a shotgun-riding sidekick to Bobby Labonte, the primary
driver at Gibbs Racing. Stewart, driver of the No. 20 Home Depot
Pontiac, has been a quick study in learning the ropes from Labonte
and is emerging as a driver to be reckoned with after a pair of
front-row starts and sixth-place finishes in the last two races.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see the 20 car with Tony step out there with that all-new
race team,'' Gibbs marveled. ``I think that was one that, if there
was a surprise in here, certainly that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, driver of the No. 18 Interstate Batteries Pontiac, has
benefitted from the expansion of the Gibbs Racing stable. With the
proliferation of multicar teams in Winston Cup, it was imperative
that Labonte have a teammate with whom to work, and to generate and
share information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby's the one that has the experience, and I know Tony's
constantly asking Bobby questions,'' Gibbs said. ``I think Bobby's
our lead guy that directs things out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like about Tony is his attitude. He doesn't have an ego
thing. He is wanting to learn every single thing he can learn. He's
excited about it. He talks to Bobby. He's a willing learner and
looks at it that way. And people like that, who have a lot of
talent, which he does, I think are going to make quick learners.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Winston Cup series resumes with Sunday's Food City 500
at Bristol, Tenn., Labonte will enter a scant 2 points behind Jeff
Burton in the standings (909-907), while Stewart is in 13th place
with 696.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say if you asked almost anybody, here or anywhere in
NASCAR, they would say that has been a real surprise to see Tony
run that well,'' Gibbs said. ``He's only had one wreck, and that
wasn't his fault. Somebody else wrecked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's run extremely well, he's qualified every week on the
first day. We've just been really excited and pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It may not all be smooth sailing for Stewart, especially come
May when he'll attempt to drive in both the Indy 500 and the
Coca-Cola 600 the same day. He has been given license by Gibbs to
attempt the Memorial Day double in Indianapolis and Charlotte,
N.C., but Stewart may have to negotiate a legal pothole opened by
John Menard, Stewart's former IRL owner. Menard, who claims to hold
an option on Stewart's contract, apparently has threatened to file
a lawsuit against Gibbs, Stewart, and their Home Depot sponsor to
prevent him from racing for any other team at Indy. But Stewart,
who was under contract to Menard from 1996-98, maintains he is no
longer contractually obligated to Menard and is free to drive for
his own IRL outfit, Tri-Star Motorsports, which he co-owns with
Larry Curry, former team manager for Team Menard. ``I'm confident
I'm free of any obligations to that team,'' Stewart said. ``I'm not
going to guess on what John is going to do. The important thing to
me is I'm confident I've fulfilled all of my obligations there and
I'm looking forward to the future and moving forward with this.'' .
. . Jeff Gordon, the defending Winston Cup champion, will aim for a
record fifth victory in the Food City 500 at Bristol Motor
Speedway. Gordon, who experienced ``the hardest hits I've ever
had'' when he smacked the outside retaining wall in the Primestar
500 at Texas Motor Speedway March 28, appears to be in much better
shape for the season's first short-track event, a grueling
500-miler at Bristol's .533-mile bullring. ``I'm feeling much
better,'' said Gordon. ``My ribs are still a little bit sore, and I
can feel it mostly when I take a deep breath. I feel fortunate that
nothing was cracked, chipped, or broken. I've just been sore. But
I'm ready for Bristol, though. I won't need a relief driver or
anything like that.'' . . . That is not likely to be the case for
Mike Skinner, who broke his right shoulder blade at Texas.
According to Skinner's crew chief, Larry McReynolds, Randy LaJoie
will be on stand-by in case Skinner is unable to go . . . Andy
Santerre, the Cherryfield, Maine, native who won the 1998 Busch
Series Rookie of the Year award, has marked his calendar and plans
to be back behind the wheel of his Busch car June 5 for the MBNA

   Roger Penske tabbed 23-year-old Brazilian driver Tarso Marques
as Al Unser Jr.'s replacement in this weekend's Firestone Firehawk
500 at Motegi, Japan. Marques jumped into the ride after Unser
fractured his right ankle in the first turn of the first lap of the
CART FedEx Series opener at Homestead, Fla., March 21. Unser, who
also sustained a small fracture and a torn ligament in his left
knee, underwent two hours of surgery at Indianapolis Methodist
Hospital and is expected to be back racing in 4-6 weeks, but will
not be able to walk for 8-12 weeks, according to his surgeon, Terry
Trammell . . . After rain postponed the initial Ice Breaker at New
Thompson (Conn.) Speedway at the end of last month, the NASCAR
Featherlite Modified Series will try this weekend to kick off its
season at New Thompson. With two-time defending series champion
Mike Stefanik now racing as a rookie on the NASCAR Craftsman Truck
Series, a new champion will be crowned.

FOUNDATION, HOMELESS SCHOOL CLASH OVER CASH, CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Thomas J. Pappas School for homeless children and the
charitable foundation created to support it are scrapping like
schoolyard bullies for control of thousands of dollars in private
donations.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by personal animosity between school officials and top
officers of the Thomas J. Pappas Regional Education Center
Foundation, the conflict over management of donations has left a
$15,000 construction project in limbo. It also indirectly led one
donor to recall a $15,000 grant because the school didn't use the
money quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   School officials are so upset that they say they're willing to
sever the relationship with the foundation and give up the money
rather than give the foundation control of the school budget. The
foundation, meanwhile, has expanded its mission far beyond helping
only Pappas School.
</P>
<P>
   The rift comes at a critical point in the school's young life,
with enrollment doubling over the past year alone. Most of the
school's funding comes from public sources, which are not
endangered, and the school appears to be thriving. However, private
donations totaling about $1.7 million over the past four years have
been tapped to pay for everything from physical education classes
to computer labs.
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County Regional School District officials say the
foundation is being stingy by not handing over all the money it has
raised, because the foundation doesn't trust the school district.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation board says it's just showing financial
responsibility and it suggests it has good reason to be concerned:
One school employee admitted embezzling a donation, and other
donations were taken without school permission.
</P>
<P>
   Amid deepening tensions, the foundation board three weeks ago
removed foundation President Ron Cooper as liaison to the school,
hoping to ease personality conflicts between Cooper and top county
school officials, including Art Parker, the district's director of
finance and administration.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, county officials are adamant that they will pass up
future funding from the foundation if its board keeps interfering
in spending decisions and berating school district employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real problem here has been the attempt, notably by Ron
Cooper, to say, `Here's our money, we want to run the school,' ''
Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Those comments are echoed by county schools Superintendent
Sandra Dowling, Parker's boss, who said she is ready to end the
relationship between the school and the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   County officials were dismayed three weeks ago to learn, from a
reporter, that the foundation quietly expanded its mission last
November so it can raise money for underprivileged children
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The news left county officials chafing over the foundation's
continuing use of the Pappas name, one most Valley residents
associate specifically with the downtown school for homeless kids.
</P>
<P>
   Dowling said she would prefer the foundation change its name,
give Pappas School all money raised in its name, then move on to
new fund-raising horizons without the school. That would allow a
new foundation to be created that would have closer ties to the
school.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs the foundation is thinking along the same lines,
although Cooper said it intends to keep the Pappas name.
</P>
<P>
   In a March 31 letter to ``The Republic,'' the foundation board
said its ``success in raising funds and community attention has
contributed to the school's ability to raise funds independently,
allowing us to move forward in a positive manner and assist other
less fortunate schools and organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides at least agree on this: The Pappas School is
providing a unique and invaluable community service, one whose
importance grows every year, along with the number of homeless
families seeking help in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   As details of the rift have spread, however, both sides fear its
disclosure will cost the Pappas School and the foundation vital
public support.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, the Pappas Foundation has raised $1,725,752 in cash
and in-kind donations, according to Kristi Donaldson, the
foundation's lone paid staff member. Pledged donations total
$225,166 more, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, a Phoenix businessman who has been the foundation
board's unpaid president since 1996, was taken aback by the school
district's increasingly open criticism, saying board members have
worked hard to help the school in recent years. The foundation's
sole reason for being, according to its articles of incorporation,
had been to support the school.
</P>
<P>
   But last November, Cooper and board members amended those
articles with the Arizona Corporation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment expands the foundation's funding horizons to
``other poor, distressed, underprivileged or homeless children from
preschool through high school in the United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   During initial interviews on the subject in mid-March,
foundation board members said they were considering how to advise
donors of the change in focus. Three weeks ago, a letter went out.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Don Zavala, an attorney, said it informs donors
that all money raised before April 1 will be used ``only for Pappas
School.'' Money raised strictly for Pappas will be held in a
separate account, he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Donaldson, $847,589 _ slightly less than half of
the $1.7 million reportedly raised by the foundation since 1996 _
has been given to the Pappas School in cash or donated goods and
services.
</P>
<P>
   However, about $190,000 worth of goods and services reported as
contributed through the foundation was, in fact, given directly to
the school by donors. Although often arranged through the
foundation, those donations were not reported to the Internal
Revenue Service as charitable contributions to the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson said a preliminary accounting indicates $726,472 in
cash and investments remains in foundation checking, savings,
investment and equity accounts.
</P>
<P>
   She said $151,691 _ or over 8 percent of the total raised since
1996 _ has paid for fund-raising, administration and overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raising alone has been a relatively small cost, amounting
to about 5 percent of total contributions, according to the
foundation's 1997 report to the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Administrative costs have included one staff person's salary,
which the foundation would not disclose.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Philanthropic Advisory Service, which offers
guidelines by which donors may judge charities, suggests reasonable
fund-raising and administrative costs should not exceed half the
total income of an organization. It also suggests that at least
half of total income should be applied to program activities.
</P>
<P>
   By those standards, the four-year financial history prepared by
the foundation shows that its fund-raising expenses are well in
line, but it is not donating at least half its total income to
program activities. Its report to the IRS for 1997 alone showed
that only about 45 percent of the direct contributions went to
program services, falling slightly short of the recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Although school district officials don't have a bone to pick
with the foundation's overhead or fund-raising costs, they do
object to the process the foundation established to dole out money
to the school.
</P>
<P>
   Dowling and Parker repeatedly complained in recent interviews
about having to apply for funding and the foundation's tight-fisted
distribution methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're not going to trust us, then we shouldn't be doing
business,'' Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation board members say they are simply doing what they
should: making sure money is used precisely as donors intended.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question the school district would like to have
funds without all the strings attached and not to have to go into
some planning process,'' said David Hansen, an Arizona Public
Service executive and foundation board member who replaced Cooper
as liaison to the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little bit more diligent in the process,'' Hansen
said. ``They kind of resent some of those controls. So that may
foster some bad feelings and, maybe, the impression that we want to
be more involved in their business than we really do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to make sure that funds are being used at the
right time, in the right place, for the right purpose, in the best
interest of the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pappas School has carved a permanent spot in the hearts of
many Valley residents because it uniquely addresses three popular
public concerns: children, schools and the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Starting nearly a decade ago as a ragtag program housed at local
churches, the Pappas School found a permanent home last school year
at 355 N. Fifth Ave., Phoenix, where a new campus was opened by the
Maricopa County Regional School District. Built with a bond-backed
loan, the campus now serves kindergarten through Grade 5. Grades 6
through 9 are housed at nearby First Presbyterian Church.
</P>
<P>
   It's a learning center, a safe haven, a feeding station and a
clearinghouse for social services that often go undelivered to
children with no permanent address.
</P>
<P>
   But it is only one part of a network of county alternative
schools serving children overlooked by regular school districts _
kids who were expelled, homeless children, pregnant teens and
residents of the northern tip of the Gila River Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the foundation board's concern is that money intended
for Pappas not be mingled with money headed to other county
alternative schools.
</P>
<P>
   It is also worried about other irregularities. A school employee
was fired last year after admitting embezzling a $1,046.75 donation
check to the foundation, according to school officials. The
foundation also complains that $1,900 in checks sent to the
foundation via the school were cashed by the school without
foundation authority. The school is in the process of reimbursing
the funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Pappas Foundation was incorporated in late 1995 by Nancy
Haas, an Arizona State University education professor, to raise
money to equip the new school once it was built.
</P>
<P>
   It was intended to pay for things that the school could not
afford or spend public money on.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, thousands of dollars in cash, goods and services
have been donated both to the school and to the foundation. The
school's enrollment has doubled to between 670 and 680 in the past
year alone.
</P>
<P>
   Its sudden growth has prompted the school to receive more than
its usual share of specially allocated growth funds from the state.
But that money won't always be there, Parker said, and supplemental
funds from private sources have always been a part of the mix to
improve programs and facilities at Pappas.
</P>
<P>
   Broad public interest in the plight of homeless children
prompted not only bountiful donations to the foundation but a
mountain of goods _ from blankets to computers _ given directly to
the school.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the school recently bought several trailers to
house the donations, then set up a system to sort and store them.
The cost: about $50,000. Parker says the foundation offered no
help.
</P>
<P>
   The wealth of donations to both the foundation and the school is
due largely to the positive publicity the school has always
enjoyed. Attracting both local and national attention, Pappas
School also spurred a tug of war of sorts between Cooper and
Dowling over who deserves credit for its success _ the county or
the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing friction prompted Dowling to name Parker her point
man in dealing with the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided that if there was a personality problem with me, I
wasn't going to let it interfere with Pappas or the fund-raising
for the kids, so I turned it over to Art about eight or nine months
ago,'' Dowling said. ``He's been dealing with it ever since, and
it's been horror stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, while guarded in his comments about Dowling, had this to
say: ``I'm not the only one who's been in Sandra's way _ I'm the
flavor of the month. Sandra's a kind of divide-and-conquer
individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper also called attention to a lengthy and unflattering 1997
story about Dowling that appeared in the local weekly ``New
Times.''``'' The article questioned Dowling's status as the lone
board member for the regional school district, saying her unchecked
power led to abuses, poor management and nepotism.
</P>
<P>
   The backdrop of mutual mistrust led the foundation board three
weeks ago to remove Cooper as its liaison with the school district,
replacing him with Hansen.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the effort to minimize personality conflicts, Parker
said fundamental differences remain. The county, he said, can't
live with foundation requirements for specific written and oral
funding requests. Nor does it like its policy of requiring the
district to pay for goods and services in advance, using district
funds that are later reimbursed by the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bookkeeping nightmare,'' Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said the foundation often wants the school district to
spend its own money on foundation-backed items, then submit
receipts for reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm subsidizing the foundation until they get around to paying
me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dowling said she would rather pass up future funding than fight
such budget wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not pay for me to have full-time people running around
on staff trying to figure out how to work the system so they can
get the foundation to give them what they need,'' Dowling said. ``I
said, `Just forget it. Don't ask for anything, we'll find another
way to do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The result: For the past several months, Parker has not asked
for any specific funding from the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The school's capital and operating costs are paid by a
combination of state funding, county taxes and whatever private
donations roll in. Operating costs last year were roughly $1.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation board members generally have required written and
oral funding requests from the school, including details on
precisely how donated money will be spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have run this like you run a business,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the standoff, donors sometimes have to wait a
long time to see their money put to use.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one corporate donor put up more than $20,000 for
school operations and supplies, giving the money to the foundation
to ensure full tax deductibility. The foundation, as a tax-exempt
organization, can offer donors greater tax benefits than if the
money is given directly to the school.
</P>
<P>
   The school district was told by the foundation that it needed to
document how the money would be used before a cent would be turned
over. The district refused, complaining that it would not create
special budgets to accommodate the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after several weeks of back-and-forth charges, a
check for $22,500 arrived in Parker's mail _ without any paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   The same argument surrounds funds that ostensibly would be used
to build shade areas on the Pappas school playground. The project
would cost roughly $15,000, Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   A donor has pledged money for the project through the
foundation, but the foundation wants detailed plans from the school
before it accepts the money, according to Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said the school sent several proposed bids to the
foundation. Foundation board members say they have seen no plans,
and they won't free up any money as long as there is no detailed
accounting from the school district.
</P>
<P>
   ``What might be unique about our situation _ as opposed to other
non-profits _ is . . . we're supporting a quasi-governmental agency
here that has a budget for their light bill, their salaries, the
operation of the school,'' said foundation board member Brenda
Armour, a Sears National Bank executive. ``We want to ensure that
the donated funds are being used for appropriate purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansen was more direct, criticizing the school's unwillingness
to work closely with the foundation on mutually agreeable short-
and long-term budget plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd fire me if I ran the business that way,'' Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more than $700,000 sits in the foundation's savings,
checking, investment and equity accounts. Though district officials
say it should be put to use, foundation board members see no danger
in sitting on the nest egg if the school isn't willing to come up
with specific spending plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to be able to help the school not only this month, but
next month, the following month, the following year, two years from
now,'' Zavala said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one donor didn't think banking his donation was such a
good idea. Jonathan Marshall, founder of the Marshall Fund of
Arizona, withdrew a $15,000 pledge for school counseling programs
after the first $7,500 sat idle for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it wasn't the foundation's fault. The foundation
gave the school the money five months after the donation arrived,
but the school district then had trouble hiring a part-time
counselor. The money was unused.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, unsure where the problem was, simply decided to get
his money back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them, if you can straighten your problems out, we'll
be happy to reconsider in the future because we still think the
program is good,'' Marshall said. &QL;

PATE'S BIRDIES ARE ALL IN A ROW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga.One, two, three _ how many consecutive birdies would
it be?
</P>
<P>
   Four, five _ Steve Pate's record bid was alive.
</P>
<P>
   Six, seven _ for one shimmering stretch it was almost heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Augusta National Golf Club bowed to Pate on Saturday and the
next thing he knew he was royalty, being feted by a gargantuan
gallery as though he were Jack Nicklaus down the stretch in 1986 or
Tiger Woods bringing history home in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Agoura Hills resident bled the course for seven consecutive
birdies to break the tournament record shared by three players and
vault into contention for his first major championship. His was the
red ribbon in which the third round of the 63rd Masters came
wrapped.
</P>
<P>
   The fun-loving Pate has tied one on before, he said, but never
like this. ``This is very special,'' he said after carding a
7-under-par 65, ``because it's someplace where it means
something,''
</P>
<P>
   From the seventh hole through the 13th, Pate went along picking
up birdies on the course as nonchalantly as workers on the other
side of the ropes did cigarette butts and beer cups.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-foot birdie putt with the five-foot break at No. 10,
chased by a 30-footer at No. 11? To hear Pate talk, it was easier
done than said. The same thing goes for the shots that set up the
7-foot uphill putt on No. 7, the 20-footer at No. 8, the 18-inch
tap-in at No. 9, the 12-incher at No. 12 and the 7-footer at No.
13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no explanation for what happened,'' Pate said, drawing
laughter from the roomful of reporters he was addressing after
moving into a tie for third with Davis Love III at 5-under 211, two
strokes behind Jose Maria Olazabal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably the easiest stretch of holes I've played all
week. For an hour-and-a-half, everything I did was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knew flukes could elicit laughter and not just pain?
Certainly not Pate, 37, who has had more accidents, if you will,
than a puppy not yet housebroken.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 the former UCLA standout broke both wrists, the right
one when he rear-ended a truck while traveling 75 miles per hour
and the left one when he tripped on a dock while vacationing at
Lake Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, Pate suffered a hip injury when the car he was
riding in was broadsided en route to a banquet during the 1991
Ryder Cup. Which is not to be confused with the time he was
broadsided by a deer in his driveway while astride his bike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done a lot of amazing things,'' Pate said, poking fun at
himself. ``Some good, some bad.''
</P>
<P>
   There was little that was ugly about Pate's first two rounds
here, save his double-bogey, bogey finish during Friday's second
round. He had been striking the ball well all week so he wasn't
nearly as surprised as all the scoreboard watchers when his birdie
barrage began on the par-4 seventh (he had foreshadowed his round
with a birdie at No. 3).
</P>
<P>
   ``I played real solid the first two days,'' Pate said. ``So it's
not like this came out of nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Pate could not say the same for his gallery. It swelled with
each stroke he shaved off par, growing so humongous that Pate could
have been forgiven for muttering, ``I am Tiger Woods.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of people in the middle of the round that
started appearing out of nowhere,'' Pate said. ``They started
appearing out of trees like Bigfoot.''
</P>
<P>
   They also started rising at every green and tee to applaud Pate.
It was a bit overwhelming, for him to look around and know the
cheers were for him, the same guy who three years ago had a hard
time getting motivated to get up off his couch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great,'' Pate said. ``You appreciate it. But it can be
a distraction so you've got to try to shut it out.''
</P>
<P>
   He hadn't given the record for consecutive birdies any thought
until he floated to the 14th tee on yet another wave of adoration.
Then, Pate said, ``it popped into my head that I might get my name
in the record book, which might be nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, by that time it was a fait accompli. His playing
partner, Lee Westwood, who had the nicest 68 that nobody noticed,
seemed to seize the significance of the moment before Pate. After
Pate's birdie putt on 13 died in the hole, Westwood bowed and
fanned Pate as if to say, ``I am not worthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe he was just trying to cool Pate off.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 13 I figured he'd caught fire, yeah,'' Westwood said.
</P>
<P>
   It was all so different from 1996, when nothing could light a
fire under Pate. He had lost much of his enthusiasm for golf even
before injuries gave him a handy excuse to leave it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 he had no top-10 finishes in 32 events and earned less
than $100,000 for the first time since his rookie year of 1985.
``My attitude wasn't good,'' Pate said.
</P>
<P>
   So when he got injured he was perfectly content to sit around
and do nothing for most of 1996. He played in three PGA Tour
events. The rest of the time, ``I got fat, really,'' Pate said. ``I
laid on the couch and ate, basically.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife Sheri finally got tired of having a human dust ball
instead of a husband. She told him to go do something. He got back
into golf because, as he explained, ``I wanted to stay married.''
</P>
<P>
   That's his punchline. In plain talk, ``I realized that playing
poorly,'' Pate said, ``is better than not playing at all.''
</P>
<P>
   And playing like he did Saturday? Well, nothing beats that. But
check back with Pate tonight.

   SHERBORN, Mass. _ There are times when Bill Rodgers wonders
whether he's crazy for even thinking about taking the line in
Hopkinton again.

   Rodgers is sitting on the sofa in his rambling brown house on a
country lane with a grandfather clock ticking in a corner and a
display case crammed with trophies from the '70s and '80s in the
hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always think I'm going to feel good when I go out the
door,'' he says. ``I think, `Hey, I'm 27.' And then I go out and
I'm still 51.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston Billy is a ``veteran'' now. He has not run the Boston
Marathon competitively in nine years. His appearance in the
centennial race three years ago was just that, a ceremonial trot
along a 26-mile memory lane. This time, it's for real.
</P>
<P>
   When he answers the gun a week from  &UR; tomorrow &LR; , Rodgers will be
chasing three age-group records: the US point-to-point mark
(2:25:46), the course mark (2:27:17), and the American course mark
(2:31:34).
</P>
<P>
   Whichever African wins the open race will have been wreathed,
medaled, interviewed, and massaged by the time Rodgers crosses the
line and waves to his two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can get a record, I'll walk away a very happy runner,''
he says. ``All I want is by one second.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1975 through 1980, when he won four times, Rodgers owned
this race. He would come bouncing down from the Wellesley hills
around 1:15 p.m. and see nothing but police motorcycles and macadam
ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I'm back in the pack a lot,'' he says. ``I see the good
runners take off and it's fascinating how far they pull away. By
the mile, they're not too far ahead. By 2 miles, it's, `Holy cow,
this is getting bad.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Rodgers harbors any illusions of hanging with the
Kenyans. The last time he ran Boston seriously, in 1990, he posted
a respectable 2:20:46 _ and came in fifth in the masters category.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers has long since conceded what the calendar and the clock
tell him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think like an age-grouper now,'' he says. ``I'm like most of
the other runners. I run for the time. I go by my watch, I look at
my splits, I go how I feel. I look for certain people whom I know
run whatever time I'm looking for. And if I don't get my time,
that's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   He has nothing to prove to the world anymore. Rodgers's face,
with its unruly shock of blond hair and its quizzical expression,
is already chiseled onto the Rushmore of modern American
marathoning, along with Frank Shorter's and Joan Benoit
Samuelson's. But Rodgers laughs if you call him an icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there's such a thing in marathoning,'' he
says. ``Pheidippides was an icon. Maybe Rosie Ruiz is an icon.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been two dozen years since Rodgers, an unknown grad
student with ``GBTC'' (for Greater Boston Track Club) penciled on
his T-shirt, won his first Boston in 2:09:55 and was hailed as
``Will Rodgers.'' (``Got some advice for you,'' a stranger told
him. ``Never take a plane ride with a one-eyed pilot.'')
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers stuck with paved roads and quickly became the affable
Everyman in the forefront of the country's running boom. Besides
his four Bostons, he also won four New Yorks. He ran in the 1976
Olympics and was leading until he ran out of gas and finished 40th.
``A beginner's mistake,'' he says now.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the glory days for US males in the marathon, when it
seemed there would be a continuum of Virgins and Salazars and
Beardsleys and Meyers, and Boston would be a made-in-America
showcase. But no Yank has won here since 1983 and none is expected
to next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is the top American marathoner right now?'' Rodgers muses.
``I don't know. It seems we've come to the end of a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers ticks off a few who have shown a recent aptitude and a
taste for the distance: Mark Coogan, Todd Williams, Jerry Lawson,
Rod De Haven. But only Bob Kempainen has run under 2:09 since 1982,
and no American ranks in the all-time world top 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the talent, but a lot of our best people now go to
track and cross-country,'' Rodgers says. ``Like Pat Porter. I
remember talking to him about the marathon because he was doing 130
miles a week. But he was already doing great and he said, why
move?''
</P>
<P>
   Why switch to an event dominated by altitude-born Africans who
compete as a team, who play cat-and-mouse with the lone challenger
until they break him? Why take on a distance that you can run well
only three times a year with little chance of winning the major
events that bring the big paychecks?
</P>
<P>
   ``You could do almost any job in America now and make a better
living at it than being a marathoner,'' Rodgers observes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a different world on the road now, and Boston Billy
understood that by 1988. He was 40 that year and no longer chasing
the laurel wreath, even if the faces lining the course didn't
understand that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually you have a five-year span when you can be at your very
best,'' Rodgers figures. ``Then physically or psychologically you
hit the wall and you can't do it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers had a decade of lining up in the front row with the
world's best, and the record that most satisfies him is the global
one he set for most marathons (28) under 2:15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so proud of that, but I don't think anybody knew about
it but me,'' he says. ``Then some Ethiopian guy passed me last
year. I don't even know his name, but I want to meet that guy and
buy him a drink.''
</P>
<P>
   The days when Rodgers could peel off a 2:15 are a decade past
and more, and he accepts that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, I'm duking it out now with the leading women,'' he
says. ``And the very best women kick my butt. Fatuma Roba, I just
wave her goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   He races for time now, and for his livelihood and for the
pleasure of the chase. Rodgers and his brother Charlie still have
their running store in Quincy Market and Rodgers still has a shoe
endorsement (Etonic), does work for Ronzoni pasta, and has other
corporate tie-ins. He leads employee fun runs, speaks to execs,
turns up at running expos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great fun going to a marathon,'' Rodgers says, ``without
having to do the marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers does only as much as he wants now. His driven,
top-of-the-world days are many checkpoints behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a world of difference between trying to win Boston and
running it when you're 50 and you have kids,'' he says. ``I used to
run around Jamaica Pond a lot and pass a park bench and think, I
just want to sit down there and look at the water. Now, I'll do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers has done enough marathons _ 57, he says _ for a
lifetime, once as many as five in a year. There are enough 5Ks and
10Ks and half-marathons around for Rodgers to easily run the 25
races he's penciled in annually for more than a quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   What lured him back to Hopkinton this time were the veterans
records for runners between 50 and 59, which he had looked up and
concluded were within reach. Rodgers was undefeated last year in 29
races at shorter distances and the times he posted in half a dozen
tuneups this year convinced him he was ready to run 26 miles and
mean it.
</P>
<P>
   Though many macadam clockers and watchers are buzzing about a
possible age-group duel between Rodgers and New Zealand's John
Campbell, Rodgers shakes his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campbell just killed me in a 10K in Alabama,'' he says. ``If
he's here, he's the top guy, without question. I don't know a
50-year-old who can beat him. He says he's trying to crack 2:20. I
don't think he can run 10 minutes faster than me. Maybe he can, but
. . .''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers is chasing not Campbell but a mark in a record book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might totally wipe out,'' he says, ``but if it's a cool day
I shouldn't be too far off, even if I miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   He is going to run steady and smart, Rodgers says, and not let
adrenaline and ambition pull him too far ahead of himself. He has
learned much since 1976 and Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I don't want to do is what I did twice here when I was
younger _ run hard and then keel over,'' Rodgers says. ``I've had
enough of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers just wants to run a sound and sensible 2:31 and not be
trucked in with the blister brigade. After all, his daughters will
be waiting for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very strange just sitting here thinking about it,'' he
says. ``I wonder, am I crazy? It's a scary thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers hears the grandfather clock ticking and a voice in his
head that reminds him that 1990 was a thousand years ago. Is he
sure he wants to go through with this?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see if I make it to the line,'' Boston Billy says, with
an impish grin. ``I still might chicken out.''
</P>

PARK WANTS TO WAIT TO TALK CONTRACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While Chan Ho Park was pitching Korea to the Asian
Games gold medal in January, Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone
was talking about signing the 25-year-old right-hander to a
long-term contract. When spring training commenced, and when Park's
agent, Steve Kim, showed up at Dodgertown, Malone reiterated his
wish.
</P>
<P>
   However, now that the season is underway, Park said he doesn't
want to deal with contract negotiations until after the season
ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sign it,'' Park said. ``Not now. Not during
the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Park doesn't want to worry from pitch to pitch on how it could
affect negotiations and a possible deal. He will earn $2.3 million
this season and won't be eligible for free agency until after the
2001 season. He's eligible for salary arbitration after this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're interested in doing a long-term deal,'' Malone said.
``The key is the timing and we want to work with Chan Ho. We're
going to let him decide when we start (talking).''
</P>
<P>
   Park said he wants to remain with the Dodgers for a long time,
and that not wanting to negotiate now doesn't mean he wants to
leave L.A. In fact, he often says how much he likes playing for the
Dodgers and that he wants to play his whole career in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Park's career numbers, industry people figure a
four-year deal worth $30 million would be the starting point in the
negotiations. Park is beginning his fourth full season in the
Dodgers organization, his third as a starter. Heading into today's
start against the Colorado Rockies, he was 34-22 with a 3.62 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   But Park's value is as a No. 2 starter, perhaps with the ability
to anchor a staff one day. In the last two years he was 29-17.
</P>
<P>
   __ On the Mark: After a day off, shortstop Mark Grudzielanek
returned to the lineup and doubled his season hit total by going 2
for 4. Through the first six innings, Grudzielanek had the only two
Dodgers hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was hitting the ball fairly well, but I hit a
couple of line drives (that were caught) in key situations,'' said
Grudzielanek, who's hitting .235. ``Actually, I was kind of upset
with having the day off. I wanted to play. I'm used to having five
or six days off a season. You have to struggle through things. I'm
not used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Pitch-outs and pepper: Eric Young (heel) and Gary Sheffield
(right hip) were both in the starting lineup. Sheffield missed
Friday's game and Johnson expressed a concern with Young's heel,
though it seemed OK. . . . The Dodgers are 5-1, but they're
surviving via the home run. They're 10 for 57 with runners in
scoring position. Gary Sheffield is 0 for 10, Grudzielanek and Todd
Hundley are each 0 for 6 and Eric Karros is 1 for 6. . . . Colorado
shortstop Neifi Perez tied a club record with three errors. . . .
Left-handed pitcher Greg Cadaret, who declined an assignment to the
minor leagues, is expected to be released Monday. The Dodgers were
trying to trade him before he becomes a free agent, but there
haven't been any takers.

TIGER APPEARS TO LACKING SOME BITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Environmental Alert. The Tiger is an endangered
species in America.
</P>
<P>
   The Tiger must be saved. Quick, spare no expense. Find that
Tiger who used to roam the greensward of America a mere year or two
ago. The species seems to be on the way to extinction, a quick
extinction, too, the Tiger's sharp bite smoothed by fame,
expectations, hype, and the sheer weight of carrying an entire
sport on his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Where is that Tiger who used to shoot a 67 and say, ``I didn't
have my A-game?'' Where is that Tiger who used to snarl at par 5s,
ripping that orange Tiger-faced cover off his driver before booming
his drive over any and all bunkers. Now, Tiger Woods pulls out his
2-iron and lays up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happens, happens,'' the man who used to be Tiger
Woods said Saturday after he struck the golf ball from tee to green
as well as any human can strike a golf ball. ``Our objective right
now is to get to the point where we can legitimately contend with
nine holes to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are words Mark O'Meara might say. Those are words David
Duval might utter. Those are words any number of good golfers might
mouth if they had shot a nice, safe, sound, and comfortable
2-under-par round of 70 on a Saturday at the Masters and were
within shouting distance of the leaders. Not words the man who used
to be Tiger Woods would say, especially when his round could have
been 65 or 66.
</P>
<P>
   Especially after this: Woods hit 17 of 18 greens Saturday, and
on the one he missed, the seventh, he was on the fringe by a foot.
Woods hit 11 of 14 fairways Saturday and the three fairways he
missed, he missed by a foot or 2 or 3, his ball sitting up nicely
in the pseudo-rough.
</P>
<P>
   But Tiger Woods could not putt Saturday. He had an astonishing
36 putts, one three-putt green, and a one-putt green, the 16 others
two putts each. The old Tiger Woods would have been fuming, smoke
billowing from his ears at this chance puttered away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was more comfortable _ by far _ with my putting (Saturday,
compared to the first two rounds),'' said the man who used to be
Tiger Woods. ``I'm starting to get used to the slower speed (of the
greens). I've left a lot of putts short this week. I've been here
four years now, this is my fifth year and I'm used to seeing the
putts a little faster. Putts that I've run by the hole in the past,
I'm leaving them short.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Faxon could have given that reply. Larry Mize, too. But if
the golfer who used to be Tiger Woods twice left makeable _ and
straight uphill, at that _ birdie putts short at the Masters, as
Woods did Saturday on the sixth and 16th holes, the Tiger would
have been snarling. Now, this Tiger Woods has explanations.
</P>
<P>
   Told his round could have been four to five shots better, if
only a few of his makeable first putts had dropped, Woods agreed,
``Yeah, easily.'' But he then added, ``Just as it could have been
four to five strokes worse (Friday), too. It all evens out in the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   When? Next month? Where? In the Quad-Cities Open?
</P>
<P>
   This new Tiger Woods has donned a pleasant mask. It's as if the
sports psychobabblers have gotten to him, telling him everything is
OK just as long as he thinks it's OK.
</P>
<P>
   Two examples: On Friday, Woods hit a horrible tee shot on the
par-3 12th, his ball bungee-jumping up and down into Rae's Creek.
Woods either misclubbed badly or misswung terribly, but he chose a
safe-to-the-psyche explanation, that ``I hit it perfect'' but the
wind ballooned his ball into disaster.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, when Woods needed eight strokes to complete his
horticultural tour of the par-5 eighth hole, again he was kind to
his psyche. Despite the eight swings, Woods argued, he had hit
several good shots.
</P>
<P>
   Can anyone imagine the former Tiger Woods distorting reality so
flagrantly?
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all can sympathize with Woods. He is barely into his
third year as a pro, into his second year as the cause of a social
revolution _ Saturday, just as two years ago, waiters flocked out
of the Augusta National clubhouse just as Woods was about to tee it
up on the first hole, the occasion too momentous to miss for black
fans everywhere _ and he has had so much to bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I'm in good shape,'' Woods replied when asked about his
chances Sunday. ``Anybody who'll be 4 or 5 under par with nine
holes to go will be right there in the ballgame. Anything can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but only if the Tiger can be saved from extinction, only
if the old Tiger can be found, only if Tiger Woods drops this new
bland mask and snarls once again.
</P>
<P>
   It was near excruciating to watch how virtually perfect Woods
was from tee to green Saturday, and then how poorly he putted,
missing all but two of his 17 chances to lower his score. It was
even worse to listen to this new Tiger say he really hadn't putted
that poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I hit a lot of good putts,'' said Woods, ``but it
was just that my feel was just a little off. I was leaving them a
little short on the low side, or I burned a couple on the top side.
It's just the matter of getting the right speed.''
</P>
<P>
   And then these words, ``You know you've just to got hang in
there. You've just got to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   America's last and only Tiger may already be extinct if words
like that are repeated. So, it is more than urgent. The old Tiger
must be found. Quickly.

BRUINS DEFUSE LIGHTNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Goodbye and good riddance.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins couldn't wait to put their back-to-back series with
the Tampa Bay Lightning behind them. After a long battle to earn a
playoff berth that ended last Wednesday with a victory over
Florida, the Bruins were just dreadful against the Lightning in
Tampa, Fla., the following night. They were shut out and couldn't
do anything right.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Tampa Bay was in town, and after a sluggish start, the
Bruins kicked it into high gear in the final two periods and earned
a 3-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The club breathed a big sigh of relief. Now the Bruins have four
days off to nurse many nagging injuries and then will play three
games in four nights against contending teams to wind up the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't analyze these last two games,'' said coach Pat Burns,
who would just as soon burn the videotape. ``These were probably
the worst two games we've played in God knows when and these are
tough games to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins picked up where they left off, falling behind, 1-0,
on a goal by center Chris Gratton at 8:10 of the first period. Rob
Tallas, who was the hard-luck loser Thursday, looked as if he might
get no support again.
</P>
<P>
   But Boston came back at 14:19 on the power play with Steve
Heinze potting his 22d to tie it. Heinze also had two assists.
Defenseman Pavel Kubina gave the Lightning back the lead at 18:52
with his eighth. In the second period, center Joe Thornton picked
up goal No. 15 on the power play to pull Boston even again at 2:07.
It was Anson Carter who tallied the winner, his 22d, scoring at
7:43 of the third period. Carter, who had a hat trick Wednesday
against Florida, took the puck from Thornton and fired a shot past
goalie Corey Schwab from low in the slot.
</P>
<P>
   The game took a turn for the weird at 12:40 with the Lightning
on a power play. Darcy Tucker was called for a high stick for
clipping Ray Bourque in the mouth. Carter was then called for an
illegal stick. Tampa players Rob Zamuner and Mike Sillinger spotted
it and pointed it out to coach Jacques Demers. Referee Kerry Fraser
measured Carter's stick and found that the blade was wider than the
3 inches allowed and assessed a minor penalty. What was odd was the
timing. The penalties ended up being coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't amount to anything,'' said Bourque. ``He was too
smart for his own good. All he had to do was wait five seconds and
let that go by and he would've had an odd-man situation. It worked
out all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said 90 percent of all sticks in the NHL are illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we learned something,'' said Burns. ``I think the players
learned something. It's something to be aware of in the playoffs. I
hope I don't have to start measuring hockey sticks now before every
game. I have enough to worry about. The onus is the player. We'll
have to take a little bit of money out of A.C.'s pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter didn't know why he was singled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was in a lot of guys' faces early in the game, maybe
they wanted to make me pay for it,'' said Carter. ``I don't really
know. It could've been anybody. I saw Petr Svoboda come over and
take a glance at my stick. I tried to hide it just in case because
I wasn't really sure what he was looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing puzzled him as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they'd gain something more out of it than they
did,'' said Carter. ``I was really wondering what they were
thinking. I don't know if they were trying to get under Burnsie's
skin. I don't know if Burnsie and Demers have a little French
rivalry going or what.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns waved off the measurement (``That's Jacques,'' he said)
and said he's just glad it resulted in a victory after such a
letdown Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had the pedal to the metal for the last two months,'' he
said. ``It's been a playoff game every single night. Now you have a
sigh of relief because you clinch in Florida and it's tough for the
players and it's tough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque said he's just glad the Lightning are out of here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to get rid of these guys after the other night,'' he
said.

HOT DAY FOR PATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ In the calm and almost summerlike heat that
turned Saturday's third round of the 63d Masters into a scorer's
delight at Augusta National GC, Steve Pate left the first tee at
11:40 a.m. and must have sent shivers up the spines of the leaders
as he played one of the tournament's heroic stretches of golf to
set up what could very well be one of its finest hours.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at the par-4 seventh, Pate ran off a remarkable record
stretch of seven consecutive birdies, punctuated by a 50-foot
birdie putt on the 10th, to soar from a tie for 28th place to a tie
for third as Moving Day became Stagnation Day in conditions that
were ideal. ``I have no explanation for what happened out there,''
said Pate. ``People started appearing out of the trees like Big
Foot.''
</P>
<P>
   When he finished his early round at 5-under-par 65_211, it
appeared he had merely shot himself into contention entering
Sunday's final round. Instead, he ended up just two shots behind
leader and 1994 champion Jose Maria Olazabal. This was an afternoon
when Greg Norman lost a ball in the azaleas on the 12th hole; when
Davis Love, who was leading at the time, wound up in water on the
15th and took a double bogey; and when Lee Janzen went bogey-bogey
on the 15th and 16th.
</P>
<P>
   The final accounting showed Olazabal (73_209) rising to the
occasion when it mattered for the second straight round to stand on
the threshold of making it back all the way after he sat out
virtually an entire year with what was originally diagnosed as a
foot injury but turned into a back ailment that threatened his
career. Norman, who holed a sizable putt for a bogey on the 12th,
floated a 9-iron out of the rough on the 18th to set up a 4-foot
birdie putt and second place at 71_210.
</P>
<P>
   Pate, who won the final PGA tournament at Pleasant Valley CC in
Sutton last summer, wound up tied with Love (70) as the sifting and
sorting process became a story of survival. Paraguayan Carlos
Franco (68) birdied the par-5 13th and 15th holes and was in a tie
with Ernie Els (69), Bob Estes (69), and Janzen (73) at 212.
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal, who saved par out of the left rough on the 18th,
salted away his lead with a birdie on the 15th. Norman, who had to
return to the tee on the 12th, ended up holing a 22-foot putt for
bogey. Then he had to come to grips with a second shot on No. 13
that ended up in a divot. ``I'll give 500 bucks if anyone can go
find that ball,'' said Norman. ``I hit the same shot the second
time. I never doubted I was going to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal, who started the round in the lead, bogeyed the third
and sixth holes and made the turn in 38. He had pars until the
15th, which has become a threatening hole with its rock-hard green,
and made the only birdie of his round when he hit a 3-iron second
shot into the green. ``It was a tough day out there,'' said the
Spaniard. ``I couldn't make any putts out there, which is the exact
opposite of yesterday, when I made everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Pate's run of birdies started at the seventh hole, where he hit
a 3-wood within 8 feet of the pin. He then birdied the eighth
(pitching wedge, 20 feet), ninth (9-iron, 1 1/2 feet), 10th
(6-iron, 50 feet), 11th (wedge, 20 feet), 12th (8-iron, 1 foot),
and 13th (lob wedge, 7 feet). The 12th? ``Just a shock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His bogey on the 17th, when he left a 9-iron short and took
three putts, was the only blemish in the round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today it just seemed easy,'' said Pate. ``Everything I was
doing was turning out well. It was probably the easiest stretch of
holes I've played all week. The first 36 holes I played well and
didn't get anything out of it, and that seemed harder than watching
the balls dive in the holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Love, who has been in contention in this tournament in the past
but has won just one major, the 1997 PGA Championship, seized the
lead when he made a 25-foot birdie putt on the 13th. Then came the
15th, when an errant drive forced him to lay up. ``That was the
mistake,'' said Love. ``I drove left, laid up, and the ball was
sitting down a little.'' His third shot went into the water, and he
wound up two-putting for a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an interesting day,'' said Love. ``I rode the roller
coaster of emotion. I just had a great, solid day all day. It's
nice to be this close.''
</P>
<P>
   What transpired Saturday didn't surprise Love. ``It's Masters
Saturday,'' he said. ``It's conditions. There were some very, very
hard greens. Tomorrow? You never know.''

LEFT GUTHRIE NOW ALL RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-GUTHRIE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ The man who may be the missing link in
the Red Sox bullpen has a missing rib.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep it at home,'' Mark Guthrie said. ``John Hudek wears his
on a necklace, but he's a little crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what it looks like? Just like one of those ribs you
eat in a restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie can make light of it now, but in 1993, when doctors
removed the top rib on Guthrie's left side, the lefthanded reliever
could not be certain he would pitch again.
</P>
<P>
   The rib had to come out in order to relieve a 7-inch blood clot
that had developed in the large vein that supplied blood to
Guthrie's left arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's happened to a few relievers,'' Guthrie said, citing the
Reds' Hudek, among others. ``The muscles in your shoulder get large
from pitching. My first rib was too big, and the rib and muscles
were squeezing the vein, impinging the flow of blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie, then with the Twins, was pitching against the Indians
when his arm suddenly went numb. Somehow, he was able to register
four more outs, but when he returned to the clubhouse after the
game and took off his uniform jersey, his arm was swollen, blue
from his shoulder to his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   He thought he'd just need some antiflammatory medication, but
the gravity of the situation was brought home to him the next
morning, when he awoke and found that his skin had turned black in
a large area extending from his collarbone to his shoulder and down
his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie reached for the phone and called the Twins' doctor. For
four days, doctors pumped medication into his arm in an attempt to
dissolve the clot. ``They called it liquid gold, because it was so
expensive,'' Guthrie told reporters afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Howard Saylor, a vascular specialist in Minneapolis,
performed the surgery and removed most of Guthrie's top left rib.
``I guess I didn't really think about how serious the operation
was,'' Guthrie said.
</P>
<P>
   The hard part was still to come. It would take months for
Guthrie to regain the strength in his shoulder. ``Your first rib
may not seem that important,'' he said, ``but because of the way
your skeletal structure works, they warned me that I could have
problems in other parts of my body, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitty Galica, the therapist who supervised Guthrie's
rehabilitation, told the St. Paul Pioneer Press that the muscles in
Guthrie's left arm were so weak he could not resist the pressure
applied by a single finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark would extend his left arm and I could put a finger on the
back of his hand and push it down,'' Galica said. ``Two months
later, I would have to lean on his arm with force to push it down.
Mark has worked very hard to get his strength back.''
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie returned to the Twins the following season, but he did
not pitch well, going 4-2 with a 6.14 ERA in 50 appearances. The
Twins traded him to the Dodgers in mid-1995, in a deal for
infielder Ron Coomer and two minor league pitchers, and Guthrie
appeared in 205 games for the Dodgers until signing a two-year,
$3.2 million free agent contract with Boston this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie's best pitch is a split-fingered fastball, though scouts
here say he doesn't throw it with the velocity he did in the past.
Both his splitter and his sinker are in the mid-80s, which means he
doesn't change speeds quite as effectively as is ideal.
</P>
<P>
   But in his first two appearances for the Sox, the 33-year-old
fit the profile of exactly what the Sox were seeking, an effective
lefthanded specialist. He relieved Bret Saberhagen in a 4-0 game in
Kansas City and breezed through a 1-2-3 seventh inning, striking
out two. Then, Friday night against Tampa Bay, he relieved Mark
Portugal with two on and one out and needed just one pitch to
induce Wade Boggs to hit into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to make a good impression,'' he said. ``Glad
to get the first one out of the way.''

CUMMINGS LIKES BEING HOME
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ Saturday was the beginning of what Val
Cummings hopes is the road to the American Race Trucks regional
championship.
</P>
<P>
   The West Covina resident, who returned to oval-track racing two
years ago after a 19-year hiatus, won the championship in 1997 and
finished a strong third in 1998. Now, helped by the close proximity
of Irwindale Speedway, he's ready to etch his name on the regional
trophy for the second time in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got a good shot at it,'' said Cummings, who
Saturday piloted his No. 1 Chevrolet Truck for the first time on
Irwindale Speedway's half-mile oval. ``I won the (American) Truck
championship in 1997, my first year out. We finished third last
year. And we'll see what happens this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good track. The series is good with a bunch of nice
guys, and this year we won't have much traveling to do. The first
year we traveled as much as 10,000 miles. (Irwindale Speedway) is
real nice because I'm only five miles away.''
</P>
<P>
   Cummings, who competed at the old Speedway 605, raced quarter
midgets in the 1960s and 1970s. He retired 19 years ago and
returned in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids were older and I had some extra money,'' Cummings said
of why he pondered a return to his first love. ``Plus, I could
afford to do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Nice night: Saturday was a strong night for Rick Harbaugh.
The Santa Fe Springs resident paced the American Race Trucks field
with a fast lap of 85.71 mph during qualifying, then, despite
starting in the back row of an inverted field, won the American
Race Trucks trophy dash race. He beat John Hulsebosch to the line
of the six-lap sprint by 1.394 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   __ NASCAR sportsman update: Saturday concluded the second night
drivers in the NASCAR sportsman classes could compete for both the
track- and regional-season championships in the respective classes.
</P>
<P>
   Gerrit Cromsigt has the early lead for the track championship in
Late Model after capturing his second victory here in as many weeks
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dusty McDonald, who finished second to Cromsigt last week,
believes the race to the Irwindale Speedway season championship in
the division is wide open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a good car, a great team and a good crew chief,''
said McDonald, a Simi Valley resident. ``It's hard to say who has
an advantage. I seen a lot of guys who have gone fast in the past,
continue to go fast. We'll just have to wait and see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Upcoming: The NASCAR Super Late Model regional series, which
made it's second of 21 stops at Irwindale Speedway on Saturday,
returns to the twin ring next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Late Models, the same type of cars that launched the
careers of NASCAR Winston Cup star Bobby Labonte and 1998 NASCAR
Busch Grand National champion Dale Earnhardt Jr., highlight Friday
night's event that also includes the third Late Model race and
Super Stocks and Mini Stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Grand American Modifieds, which made their second appearance
this past Friday, return Saturday, April 17 as part of a combined
NASCAR/USAC show that includes Midgets and Quarter-Midgets.

Collins hopes NFL team sees his love for game, gives him a chance
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cecil ``the Diesel'' Collins is a legend in Louisiana. Legendary
for one glimpse of almost unparalleled greatness at LSU.
</P>
<P>
   Legendary for failing drug tests, being arrested twice and
getting kicked out of two colleges.
</P>
<P>
   In next weekend's NFL draft, Collins won't be the first or
second running back selected. He might not even be third or fourth.
But general managers, coaches, personnel directors and scouts agree
no prospect is more intriguing than Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this,'' Collins says with a huge grin. ``There can't be
any back hungrier than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins isn't just hungry _ he's starved for football. Once he's
drafted, he has a chance to be a model case for a player who turned
around his life and fulfilled his enormous potential. Or he can go
down as a blown pick, a con artist who wasted the kind of God-given
talent many scouts call extremely rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've missed the game so much, too much,'' Collins says. ``It's
been so long since I've played. I'm trying to prove I'm not a bad
person, that I'm a good person who can do all the right things on
and off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to church and trying to get back with the Lord. I'm
trying to get my life straight. I'm looking forward to having an
opportunity to take care of my family. I want to be a role model.''
</P>
<P>
   Cecil the Diesel a role model?
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a role model for kids, to show them I got
everything straightened out, that I worked hard and came back from
a lot of adversity,'' Collins says.
</P>
<P>
   And Collins knows about adversity. Like a hurricane, Collins
blew through Baton Rouge in a flash, and then he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   At Leesville High School, Collins became the second-leading
rusher in Louisiana history. In 1996 at LSU, he was a Proposition
48 casualty. He began the 1997 season on the bench behind Kevin
Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   When Faulk was injured, fans in football-mad Baton Rouge got
another look at the Diesel. In his first appearance for the Tigers,
Collins carried 22 times for 172 yards against Mississippi State.
In the next game against Auburn, he carried 27 times for 232 yards.
He followed those Southeastern Conference games with 179 yards
against Akron.
</P>
<P>
   But one week later at Vanderbilt, the Diesel ran out of fuel. On
his third carry, Collins suffered a fractured fibula and ligament
damage in his ankle. His season was over, but his rsum showed 583
yards rushing on 69 carries, an incredible 8.4-yard average per
carry.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was tough,'' Collins says. ``While I had it going, it was
a lot of fun. It was fun to get that opportunity to play at that
level, especially playing in the SEC. It was great.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, hey, things happen to everybody, all types of things.
Now, I'm ready for better things.''
</P>
<P>
   After undergoing surgery on his leg and ankle, Collins began the
long and arduous rehabilitation period. In the summer of 1998, his
life and his football career began to unravel, and he had no one to
blame but himself.
</P>
<P>
   In separate incidents in June and July, he was arrested twice.
He was indicted on two counts each of unauthorized entry and simple
battery. He pleaded guilty. Last week, a judge suspended his
sentence, and Collins was given supervised probation for four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Because Collins had flunked three drug tests at LSU for smoking
marijuana, he was kicked off the team. He transferred to McNeese
State and reported overweight and out of shape. In two games last
season, he rushed for 46 yards on 12 carries against Southeast
Oklahoma and 71 yards on 17 carries against Northern Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a drug test was ordered, and he failed for smoking
marijuana. Because it was a violation of his probation, Collins
spent 27 days in East Baton Rouge Parish Prison and two months in a
halfway house.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those things happened, but I can't dwell on them,''
Collins says. ``It was bad, but I turned into a man. I just got
through it. You've got to move on with your life. I've tried to
correct everything and do better.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I sat down and analyzed everything. Not only did I
harm myself, but I harmed my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins sought the counsel of his father, James, a prison
officer in Richmond. He thought about his two children _ daughter
Zakei, 2, and son Brandon, 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I did will affect my children, too,'' he says. ``They
look up to me. I want them to respect their father. Right now, I'm
feeling good about myself and my family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably stronger because of what's happened to me, but
I've always been a positive person. It's changed me for sure, but
I'm not the first person who's made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins laughs a lot. He's comfortable answering uncomfortable
questions. His agent, Jimmy Sexton, has prepared him well for his
indoctrination into the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   At the Indianapolis scouting combine, Collins, 22, was 5-8{ and
209 pounds. On a sore hamstring, he ran the 40-yard dash in 4.45
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   NFL teams know everything about Collins on and off the field. He
has spent the last three months trying to tell them what's in his
heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know where I've been,'' Collins says. ``I've been in
hiding. They know the things that went on in my life. But everybody
goes through changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm back on the scene now. It's been a while since I've played
football, but, hey, I'm an athlete. I don't think it's going to be
tough to be ready. I'm in shape right now. Once I get back on the
field, I think things will go good. I'm just waiting for that
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Randy Moss' success with the Vikings last season should
benefit Collins. Like Collins, Moss had a checkered past. The team
that drafts Collins can remind the fans and media what happened to
Moss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give him a lot of credit because of the problems he had
going into the draft,'' Collins says. ``A lot of people were
doubting him. He dropped down in the first round. Then he proved
everybody wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I think I'm going to prove everybody wrong.
Fortunately, you're allowed to get a second chance in life. That's
what Moss got. Right now, that's what I've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins isn't concerned about where he will be drafted. Miami
loves him. Coach Jimmy Johnson is secure enough to draft Collins
and withstand criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really optimistic, but I'm not expecting the worst,
either,'' Collins says. ``I'm kind of in between. I'm just lucky to
get the opportunity. But I think the team that takes me is going to
be lucky, too. Hey, even if I don't get drafted, I'm going to make
the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Collins is asked where he thinks he would be rated if he
hadn't had the off-the-field problems, he hesitates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the future would have held,'' he says.
``Those things just happened at that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's a mystery. Just like the game's a mystery. I'm
a strong person, but I feel like I'm a mystery to them (teams). I
just look them in the eye, tell them the truth and try to explain
what's going on in my life and which direction I'm headed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, Collins is headed up. University of Texas Heisman
Trophy winner Ricky Williams will be the first back selected. Miami
underclassman Edgerrin James will be the second. Collins or Faulk,
his former LSU teammate, could be third.
</P>
<P>
   Collins doesn't think he should take a back seat to any back,
including Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say he's any better than me, but I'm not
going to say I'm better than him,'' Collins says. ``I like Ricky. I
like his style. He's a great player. I think we have a similar
style of running downhill. By that, I mean I ain't no jitterbug. I
just run downhill and try to put the ball in the end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   If Collins doesn't go early in the draft, he can draw
inspiration from Terrell Davis, Jamal Anderson and Dorsey Levens,
three of the NFL's best backs _ all of whom were drafted after the
fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody respected them because they didn't do too much in
college,'' Collins says. ``They weren't expected to do much in the
NFL. It's not where you get drafted. It's what you do when you get
there. If you've got heart and your mind's right, you can be
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins insists he has heart, and he claims his mind's right.
Many of his fans in Louisiana hope he will succeed, but his critics
wait for him to fail. Only time will tell.

Three factors jeopardize Williams' status as top pick
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
It might not be the same as going from a penthouse to an outhouse
or even seeing your fluffy French pastry turn into a pop tart, but
it hurts.
</P>
<P>
   After a yearlong worship service in his honor, Ricky Williams is
finding out he is not the perfect football player after all, or at
least that is what some NFL teams are trying to tell him.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time recently when the University of Texas running
back was considered the best college football player in the
country. Even his stiffest competition for the subjective honor _
Tim Couch, Cade McNown, Michael Bishop and others _ proclaimed the
NCAA's all-time leading rusher to be just that.
</P>
<P>
   But a few weeks ago there were rumblings from the front offices
in Cleveland, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, Indianapolis and Washington
that Williams might be the best college football player available
for the 1999 NFL draft, but he might not be the best one available
for those teams.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to prove there is no one better, Williams held an open
house in San Diego on Monday and then went on a door-to-door sales
trip in hopes of preventing a slide from the top of the NFL draft
board.
</P>
<P>
   In the short span of three days, Williams threw dirt on the
floor and plugged in his vacuum cleaner in St. Louis, New Orleans,
Washington, Philadelphia, Cleveland and Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allowed a 21-year-old young man to meet football people he
would have not otherwise had a chance to meet,'' said Leland Hardy,
Williams' agent. ``It was a chance for building relationships with
owners, general managers and coaches in a sport where he is going
to be a prominent player.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is in little danger of coming down with the dreaded
``draft-day slippage.'' You know, sitting around an embarrassingly
long time April 17 _ a la Thurman Thomas, Darren Lewis or Randy
Moss _ waiting for his name to be called.
</P>
<P>
   No, he almost assuredly will go in the first six picks, but he
believes he should be No. 1. Of course, he thought that before the
NFL started to review his rsum. There have even been reports some
teams are concerned because he has shorter arms and smaller hands
than normal, which might lead to fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the top guys are scrutinized the most to try to find
out the kinks in their armor,'' Williams said as he toured the
country this week. ``And I understand that they're investing a lot
of money in players like myself so it's going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the way things are, if it's not one thing it's going
to be something else. So, I'm not worried about it. I'm sure if it
wasn't if I had bigger hands then it would be something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the questions, some will do whatever it takes to get
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans has stated it would trade its entire 1999 draft
allotment, including the 12th pick of the first round, to move up
high enough to choose Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone thought Williams would be the top pick until
three postseason events affected his stock _ Couch escapes,
Williams inflates, Master P negotiates. Those three factors
introduced a question to the foregone conclusion Williams would be
the first player taken.
</P>
<P>
   That honor might well go to Couch or Oregon's Akili Smith. The
first three draft picks might be quarterbacks for the first time
since 1971, when Jim Plunkett, Archie Manning and Dan Pastorini
went 1-2-3.
</P>
<P>
   But hold on. Cleveland coach Chris Palmer met with Williams on
Friday and told the San Diego native no decision has been made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very candid with him and told him what direction we
possibly can go, that there were several avenues we can take and we
would not have brought him in here unless we were truly interested
in him,'' Palmer said. ``I told him he was definitely in the
hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is why Williams might be in the hunt, but is no longer the
pick of the litter.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback factor &QC;
</P>
<P>
   When Couch elected to go to the University of Kentucky to play
football, some questioned his sanity. Had he decided to stay for a
fourth year at the basketball-dominated school, the questions would
have been answered.
</P>
<P>
   When the record-setting quarterback chose to enter the NFL draft
after his junior season, there was talk the expansion Cleveland
Browns could not go wrong in selecting a franchise quarterback as
the team's first pick.
</P>
<P>
   Couch's decision gave Williams instant competition for the
coveted No. 1 slot in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Clouding matters is the group of subpar little-knowns, who last
season were the starting quarterbacks for Philadelphia, Cincinnati,
Washington and St. Louis _ the teams with the Nos. 2, 3, 5 and 6
draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   This draft is considered to have the most quarterback prospects
since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis, which has the fourth pick, has a franchise
quarterback in Peyton Manning, the No. 1 selection in 1998, and a
top-notch running back in Marshall Faulk. The Colts might opt to
take Williams should he be available, and trade Faulk. Miami is
rumored to be interested in Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns might not be sold on Couch as their top pick after an
earlier workout, but they were leaning toward another quarterback,
Smith, instead of Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' workout last week apparently did not change that, but
you never know. Couch gets his chance in a workout for the team
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky helped himself,'' Cleveland general manager Dwight Clark
said of Monday's workout. ``But as far as him being our clear-cut
No. 1 guy, it's tough to say. We still have the Couch workout to go
through. That will tell us some more and we'll make our decision
after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland owner Al Lerner and team president Carmen Policy, who
have not attended any other potential draft pick's workout, are
scheduled to attend Couch's workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if Couch's workout will make or break him, but
it's certainly important,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   With quarterback being such a precious commodity, Williams'
can't-miss status still does not guarantee a spot among the top
three picks. It might have had he not exhibited a weight problem
after the season.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter-pounder factor &QC;
</P>
<P>
   After a glorious season, Williams packed home such prestigious
honors as the Heisman Trophy, the Doak Walker Award, the Maxwell
Award and an ESPY. Problem is, each award has its own celebration,
banquet or dinner, or maybe all three.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the airline meals, hotel room service and banquet
fare hit Williams in the gut, literally.
</P>
<P>
   The usually rock-hard 5-10, 225-pounder ballooned to 244 pounds.
There was probably little cause for alarm though because Williams
said in November that he regularly gains 20 to 30 pounds every
offseason. The difference is this offseason the NFL was watching.
</P>
<P>
   When Williams showed up at the NFL combine, he measured 5-10,
244 pounds. He had shrunk two inches and gained 20 pounds from his
listed size at Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most media guides are wrong and Texas' was as well,'' Hardy
said. ``Ricky probably played at 235 pounds and he put on a few
pounds, because for the first time in his life he wasn't in the
weight room every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The French Quarter factor &QC;
</P>
<P>
   This might be the most important ingredient in Williams'
rise-and-fall formula, though it is difficult to get an NFL
executive to admit to it.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans is the stomping ground of Williams' agent, Percy
Miller. Even Williams' mother questioned the hiring of No Limit
Sports at first.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is upset at what he calls an attack on his character by
those questioning his decision to sign with Miller's No Limit
Sports.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who also represents Ron Mercer of the Boston Celtics and
Ricky Davis of the Charlotte Hornets, has said he is a businessman
and not involved in negotiating the contracts of any of his
clients.
</P>
<P>
   Clark says the fears, which gained momentum at the combine, are
unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was drifting around at the time of the combine, and
somebody sat him down and said, `Do this and that,' and he's done
it,'' Clark said. ``We've checked on him thoroughly and he's a
really good kid. To talk to him, you know he's genuine. I really
like him.''
</P>
<P>
   But does he like him enough to draft him No. 1?
</P>
<P>
   Williams hopes so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see myself fitting in, in Cleveland,'' Williams said. ``It's
a great organization. They have the best fans in the NFL. Maybe I
can charm them into taking me No. 1. But it looks like they are
bent on drafting a quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy says Williams will ``be doing two-a-days before any other
1999 draftee,'' meaning his client will be easy to sign.
</P>
<P>
   That is good news to whichever teams chooses him. What team that
will be is anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is sure. Williams is positive that team will get the
best player available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to be No. 1, that's human nature, that's why
we compete,'' Williams said. ``But if I don't go No. 1 somebody
will get a hard-working player, who gives it his all every time
out. I think they'll be happy with that.''

ROCKIES ARE NO OBSTACLE TO DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kevin Brown can mix intensity with poise,
understand and deal with the magnitude of an event such as opening
day, yet be able to eliminate emotion from it.
</P>
<P>
   It's his strength and, he said in hindsight, one of the
weaknesses in his first start with the Dodgers. Brown rarely makes
the same mistake twice.
</P>
<P>
   If the last season of the 1900s unfolds the way the Dodgers
believe it will, they will undoubtedly remember Brown's second
outing much more than his first.
</P>
<P>
   Brown allowed three hits in eight innings and the Dodgers got
homers from Raul Mondesi and Eric Karros in a 2-0 win against the
Colorado Rockies at Dodger Stadium on Saturday. It was the
antithesis of Brown's opening day _ a three-homer outing in which
he was pulled after 52/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is probably going to happen a lot more frequently than
what happened opening day,'' Karros said. ``This is Kevin Brown.
It's why he's been to the World Series the last two years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies looked as though they had one glorious opportunity
to score against Brown _ but in reality, they never had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's throwing error in the fourth put Rockies on second and
third with none out and the middle of the lineup due up. Brown also
tweaked his right hip on the play when he and third baseman Adrian
Beltre bumped fielding Neifi Perez's dribbler down the line.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter. Brown stuck out Pat Watkins and Dante Bichette
and got Vinny Castilla to fly to left to end the inning. The
Rockies had two more baserunners the rest of the way. Brown (1-0)
and closer Jeff Shaw, who notched his third save, retired the last
12 Rockies in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have tried so much to keep the adrenaline out of
(opening day) that I may not have been pumped up enough,'' Brown
said. ``I probably threw more and worked more (between starts). I
tried to find a comfort zone. I was searching.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown found the downward action on his pitches. Sixteen of his
outs were on groundballs, including one double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was going to have a good start,'' Beltre said. ``He
was throwing strikes and had good speed on his fastball and it was
sinking. I knew there would be a lot of groundballs.''
</P>
<P>
   The only reason Brown didn't try for his 16th career shutout was
the slight stiffness he told manager Davey Johnson he was
experiencing before the eighth inning. It was a result of the brush
with Beltre and it bothered Brown so much he went out and threw his
fourth 1-2-3 inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I'm going back out there,' but if anyone got on I
would have hooked him,'' Johnson said. ``There was no question for
me after the eighth.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned into the type of pitchers' duel that was expected
opening day when Brown and Randy Johnson met. The Dodgers won that
one 8-6 in 11 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the fireballing Johnson, it was Colorado's Darryl
Kile (1-1) baffling the Dodger hitters with effective wildness. He
hit three batters, walked another five and pitched his way out of
three bases-loaded situations in six innings. The most crucial was
the fourth inning when the Dodgers loaded the bases with none out
but failed to score.
</P>
<P>
   While the clutch single never came, the long ball did on Kile's
first pitch of the seventh. It was a belt-high fastball that
Mondesi whacked to left for his league-leading fourth homer. Two
batters later, Karros hit his first homer of the season, a towering
shot down the left-field line.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to go out there and keep them from scoring,'' Brown
said. ``They (his teammates) picked me up the other day and I did
my job today.''

CARDINALS MUST DECIDE WHICH WAY TO GO IN DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Imagine a speedy receiver _ say Torry Holt or
David Boston _ sprinting past the opponent's secondary to snare a
long touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   Or a revamped linebacking corps _ say Chris Claiborne or Andy
Katzenmoyer in the middle, or Rahim Abdullah outside _ finally
stuffing the New York Giants' rushing game.
</P>
<P>
   Or a huge left tackle _ such as Tempe native John Tait _
protecting quarterback Jake Plummer and opening holes for Adrian
Murrell.
</P>
<P>
   Or Plummer handing off on third-and-2 to a big back with the
size and strength to move a pile and convert.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals can envision it.
</P>
<P>
   Matter of fact, they expect to make at least one of the above
reality in the annual NFL draft next Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be prepared to go a lot of different directions on draft
day,'' Coach Vince Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are coming off their first winning record (9-7)
since 1984, their first playoff appearance in a full-length season
since 1975, and their first playoff win since 1947, when they won
the NFL championship.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to build on that momentum with their 11 draft picks,
including eighth and 21st in the opening round, the biggest
question facing them is which position to address first.
</P>
<P>
   Signs point to wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess where a difference of opinion could occur is when you
address a particular need,'' Tobin said. ``When you draft that high
you don't want to get a player who is going to sit on the bench for
couple of years. You hope you draft a guy there who is going to
play and be a very, very good football player, have an impact on
your team.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt, of North Carolina State, is considered the best receiver
in this year's crop. At 6-feet, 190 pounds, he has been compared
with Jerry Rice of the San Francisco 49ers. He also is an
outstanding return specialist, another Cardinals need with Eric
Metcalf not expected back.
</P>
<P>
   Holt almost came out a year early last season. By all accounts,
he benefitted from staying for his senior season. He should be a
solid top-10 pick.
</P>
<P>
   The only negative on Holt is a reportedly low score on the NFL's
intelligence test during the league scouting combine in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Others think Boston, of Ohio State, has an edge because he is
slightly larger (6-2, 205) and nearly as fast. What scouts must
sort out is whether Boston, who is leaving the Buckeyes after his
junior year, is ready for pro football.
</P>
<P>
   They also have to satisfy themselves that he can be a main
weapon. Holt was without question the leader of the Wolfpack
offense. Boston was surrounded by several luminaries at Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals offensive coordinator Marc Trestman wanted to use
three- and four-wide receiver sets but often was thwarted because
Metcalf was injured and not productive, and because fourth receiver
Fred Brock, who went to Cleveland in the expansion draft, was
inexperienced and short.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' receiving tandem of Rob Moore and Frank Sanders
has been one of the league's best for three years. Adding another
target for Plummer, especially one with breakaway speed, would make
an emerging offense even more explosive.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, however, are coming off a year in which they paid
a $7.5 million signing bonus to defensive tackle Eric Swann, just
under $11 million to defensive end Andre Wadsworth and a
league-record $15 million to Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   That's about as deep as their pockets are. Estimates of the
signing bonus for the eighth pick this season run at about $6
million. That opens the possibility of a trade down, possibly to
10th or 12th in the first round, where the Cardinals would not have
to shell out as much cash and still be able to land Boston or Tait.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that their first pick is used for a receiver, the
Cardinals then face some decision-making. Do they spend still more
time and energy trying to re-sign free-agent outside linebacker
Jamir Miller, their leading tackler last season, who now is
represented by agent Leigh Steinberg? Could Steinberg get another
of his clients, fullback Larry Centers, to restructure his contract
to create salary-cap room that would allow the club to offer more
to Miller?
</P>
<P>
   Or should they tell Miller once and for all to go fish and then
go another way in the draft?
</P>
<P>
   Given that Miller might have been the most valuable player of
the defense last year after Swann was felled by a season-ending
knee injury, they should not blow him off. They should find a way
to salvage him, if Miller is willing, as he says, to now bite the
bullet for one year with a below-market incentive-laced
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Cardinals more than likely will have their choice
of middle linebacker Katzenmoyer, another Ohio State player leaving
after his junior year, or outside linebacker Abdullah of Clemson,
with the 21st pick.
</P>
<P>
   But if a quick arrangement is reached this week with Miller _
considered unlikely because the club's personnel people now are
engrossed with draft preparation _ then they would draft a tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Four tackles are considered to have first-round potential _ Tait
(6-7, 290) of Brigham Young; Lonnie Shelton (6-5, 324) of Eastern
Michigan; Matt Stinchcomb (6-6, 295) of Georgia, and Aaron Gibson
(6-7, 371) of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Some early mock drafts have all four of them being taken before
the Cardinals' 21st pick.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardinals have drafted a receiver at No. 8 and agreed to
terms with Miller, they could package some of their remaining draft
picks with the No. 21 pick and move up to get a tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Both Tobin and Bob Ferguson, Cardinals vice president for player
personnel, downplay the need for a left tackle, saying backup Matt
Joyce and Anthony Clement, who missed all of last season after
surgery on a herniated disk, are excellent candidates to replace
seven-time Pro Bowler Lomas Brown, who left for Cleveland via free
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't have a gun to our heads as far as a left
tackle goes,'' Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   In the lower rounds, the Cardinals need to find a big back,
depth across the offensive line and a third quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson said he is thankful the draft has several first-round
prospects at quarterback. Four teams drafting ahead of the
Cardinals in the opening round need starting quarterbacks. The
Cardinals, with Plummer, do not. Perhaps three of the first four
picks will be quarterbacks, in turn driving players at positions of
greater need lower where they would be available to the Cardinals.
Claiborne, a middle linebacker from Southern California, could be
one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 11 picks in this draft, and it's a deep draft,''
Ferguson said. ``We just want to get the best player. I hope
everybody ahead of us takes a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you for sure what we're going to do, but I can
tell you that we will not draft a quarterback at No. 8.'' &QL;

DRUG CASE PAVED WAY FOR EMPIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - There will be a birthday of sorts this Friday. Nobody
will celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix, the big league sports market, will turn 12 years old.
As a historical marker, the day is unofficial. Publicists and
marketing directors probably would prefer to memorialize the
official arrival of the NFL, NHL, major league baseball, arenas and
ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   Without all of them, there is no big top. No show.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the stage was set on April 16, 1987. That's when a
major league town grew out of a major league scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Five players who were former or current Suns that year were
indicted by a Maricopa County grand jury. The indictments and
subsequent headlines told a sordid tale of suspected drug use and
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Six others were mentioned in indictments but not charged.
Testimony from one _ the Suns' leading scorer, Walter Davis _ was
crucial through the entire incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Illustrated'' called the case ``the biggest drug bust
in the history of professional sports.'' As it turned out, it was
something less than that.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the five players, there were eight other people
in the Valley restaurant business who were indicted on drug-related
charges such as conspiracy to possess or conspiracy to traffic in
narcotics, mostly cocaine. Of the 13, only one spent time in jail,
and that was on a charge not related to the investigation and
prosecution of the players.
</P>
<P>
   On the law enforcement scoreboard, it was a forgettable case.
</P>
<P>
   But Suns President and Diamondbacks Chief Executive Officer
Jerry Colangelo hasn't forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Without an investigation by the Phoenix Police Department and
the subsequent charges filed by the Maricopa County Attorney's
Office, the Suns owners might not have been so eager to put the
franchise up for sale. But they did, and Colangelo, then the Suns
general manager, put together a group that purchased the team in
1988 for $44.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the estimated value of the team has at least
quadrupled, according to various business magazines. And downtown
has been transformed. The old vacant lot is not so empty anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's speculation, but the opportunity presented itself because
the old owners were disenchanted,'' said Colangelo, managing
general partner of a group that bought the Suns from Donald Pitt
and Don Diamond of Tucson and Richard Bloch of Santa Fe. ``I used
to read about this, but sometimes, yes, opportunity does come out
of adversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite honestly, you could build a case that because of that, a
team was purchased, an arena was built, a ballpark was constructed
and a major league baseball team was acquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changed the landscape of Phoenix forever.''
</P>
<P>
   It also changed Colangelo forever. His confrontation with the
crisis turned a relatively anonymous NBA general manager into a
powerful and sometimes controversial figure. He emerged like the
city itself. A winner. One of the few.
</P>
<P>
   There weren't many victories for anyone else who had a role in
the scandal. There were lessons. And some regrets. For one person,
there was tragedy that in some minds is still a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Former Suns guard Johnny High died early in the morning of June
13, 1987, at a spot that today sits near the late-afternoon shadows
cast by Bank One Ballpark. High was alone behind the wheel when his
car hit a light pole at 20th and Jefferson streets.
</P>
<P>
   The former Suns guard had testified to the grand jury. He also
was not charged. &QL; 
Moving on &QL; 
Since then, the players involved have drifted on to other lives and
other cities. So have most of their friends and acquaintances who
were either charged or somehow drawn into the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Most don't want to talk. They have families, jobs and lives to
live. Others have players from a different generation to coach.
They don't want to be remembered for a time when the NBA was a
fast-paced reflection of an era when drugs were cool.
</P>
<P>
   It was life on the run. Basketball and ``Boogie Nights.''
Players served up triple-doubles on the floor and were served
triple-doubles at last call. Cocaine was felonious, chic and
available in trendy nightspots coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a learning experience,'' said Alvin Scott, a 6-foot-7
forward who was not charged. He was named an unindicted
co-conspirator two years after he completed an eight-season career
with the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was part of growing up. That's all I can say,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not bitter or angry with anybody else about what happened.
It was just part of those times, and I was there. I've moved on.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott, a Southwest Gas employee for the past 10 years, continues
to live and work in the Valley, unlike the players indicted. James
Edwards, Jay Humphries, Grant Gondrezick, Garfield Heard and Mike
Bratz were indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, a center, entered a plea bargain in which he agreed to
undergo drug counseling. Charges were dismissed. The Suns then
traded him to Detroit midway through the 1987-88 season. He played
in the NBA for eight more years and won three championship rings,
two with Detroit and one with Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Humphries, a guard, entered a drug diversion program that
included counseling. Charges were dismissed. The Suns traded him to
Milwaukee, where he played for a few years. Today he's working as
an NBA scout and lives in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Gondrezick, a guard, pleaded guilty to witness tampering in a
plea bargain that called for a $100 fine and three years of
probation in exchange for dismissal of felony charges. The Suns
waived him. He played in Europe for a couple of years. Today he's
living in Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Bratz, a guard, had ended his playing career at the time of the
indictments and was living in Sacramento. California authorities
refused to extradite him. A Sacramento assistant district attorney
called the charges vague and unsubstantiated. Eventually, they were
dismissed. Bratz worked as a Sacramento Kings assistant coach
through last season. Today he's a scout. This week, he'll be
coaching one of the teams of NBA draft prospects at the Nike Desert
Classic at Wells Fargo Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Heard, a former Suns forward, also was retired at the time of
the indictment. Charges were dropped. Heard then was hired as an
assistant to then-Dallas Mavericks Coach John MacLeod, who was
fired by the Suns before the indictments came down. Heard is now an
assistant coach of the Detroit Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like me, I guess the other fellas are trying to move on with
their lives,'' said Scott, the father of three daughters who range
in age from the early teens to the mid-20s. ``I can't speak for
everybody, but I know I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott said he has no contact with Davis, who lives in Denver.
Davis worked as a broadcaster after playing for the Nuggets, who
signed him as a free agent after the Suns let him go in July 1988.
He then moved into the Nuggets community relations department,
where he worked through last season. He could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Others touched by the case include:
</P>
<P>
   Former Suns guard Don Buse, who has been living in Hammond, Ind.
He was not charged in the case, but his name was included in
national wire service reports. When the story broke, Buse was an
assistant coach with the Spurs. San Antonio newspapers ran
headlines that linked his name to alleged cocaine use. He left the
Spurs' coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Dennis Johnson has been living in Orlando, where the
former Celtics assistant coach was charged with spousal abuse in
November 1998. This month, he was hired to coach a Continental
Basketball Association team in La Crosse, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   DJ also was not charged in the case, but, like Buse, he was
mentioned in the widely publicized allegations. At the time, he was
starting for the Celtics, who would lose to the Los Angeles Lakers
in the NBA Finals that year. In a memorable news conference before
a Celtics-Bucks playoff game at Milwaukee, DJ was asked if he were
a casual user of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   DJ angrily dismissed the question by saying he didn't know what
was meant by casual. He said he simply didn't use the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bucks center Paul Mokeski sobbed as he stood next to
DJ, whose number was retired by the Celtics a couple of years ago.
Mokeski had not been charged, either. His name wasn't in an
indictment, but it was in newsprint. In terms of his reputation,
there wasn't much difference between the two. &QL; 
Drug policy under fire &QL; 
Questions remain about how much the NBA has moved beyond those
difficult days.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 12 years after the indictments, the NBA drug policy
continued to be a source of controversy last fall. It was an issue
in negotiations to end the owners' lockout. The players agreed to
be tested for marijuana for the first time since an NBA drug policy
was implemented.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987 and in years since, the league's drug policy has been
questioned. Is it a serious campaign or mere window dressing?
</P>
<P>
   The question was often at the philosophical heart of the 1987
investigation, which was led by then-Phoenix Police Chief Ruben
Ortega, Maricopa County Attorney Tom Collins, prosecutor James
Keppel and Detective Gary Ball.
</P>
<P>
   Like the players they investigated and tried to prosecute, these
men have moved on to different lives. Ortega is the police chief in
Salt Lake City. Collins is an attorney in southern Arizona's
Cochise County. Keppel is a Maricopa County Superior Court judge.
Ball is retired in Pocatello, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, what got my eyes opened in this whole thing is that
you have star athletes who have been idolized since they were in
grade school,'' said Collins, who has been in Cochise County for
nearly 10 years. ``There is all this adulation, and then they are
handed all this money. They travel all over the country, put up in
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have this moving party atmosphere, this movable-feast
aspect. They are in this kind of specialized shell. They are not
mature emotionally. They're extremely vulnerable to what happened
then and, from what I hear, happens now.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he is not a sports fan. But he said he couldn't
help remembering what happened in 1987 when he heard about Magic
Johnson's HIV diagnosis a few years ago and Latrell Sprewell's
assault last season of Golden State Coach P.J. Carlesimo.
</P>
<P>
   Keppel declined comment. It would be inappropriate because of
his responsibilities as a judge, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before he moved to the bench, however, Keppel talked to writers
Armen Keteyian, Harvey Araton and Martin F. Dardis for a 1997 book
titled ``Inside The New NBA, Money Players.''
</P>
<P>
   A portion of an early chapter is devoted to the Phoenix
investigation and how it exposed the NBA drug policy as a
well-marketed but hollow campaign against substance abuse. Keppel
recalled a visit from Gary Bettman, then deputy commissioner of the
NBA and current National Hockey League commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Keppel said Bettman was worried that the widely praised policy,
adopted in 1983, might be destroyed by the investigation. The book
quoted Keppel as saying he didn't think the policy ``was that
effective in the beginning.'' Ball is quoted as saying Bettman
wanted to protect the league's image and sweep evidence of
potential problems ``under the rug.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, however, said he does not recall any overt pressure
from the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really couldn't put pressure on me or Ruben Ortega or
anybody else working on the case,'' Collins said. ``They came into
our offices very self-importantly and expressed their concerns.
There was a lot of strutting around by guys in very expensive
suits. But not much more than that.'' &QL; 
Case falls apart &QL; 
Collins' case came apart within three months after April 17, 1987,
when a shopping cart full of indictments was pushed into a room
jammed with reporters. The news conference itself became a target.
Defense attorneys dismissed it as a publicity stunt. Critics called
it a cheap platform for the political ambitions of Collins and
Ortega.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he was stunned by the backlash.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, the story about the investigation had been on the
front pages for days,'' Collins said. ``We had been besieged by the
press for days to say something, say anything. Finally, we called
that press conference, which was the biggest circus I had ever seen
in my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically stood up in front of that screaming, howling mob
and read the indictments. Then we sat down. That was our big
publicity stunt.''
</P>
<P>
   What followed was a flood of leaks to the media detailing grand
jury testimony from Davis, or High, or Scott, or former center and
first-round draft pick William Bedford.
</P>
<P>
   Collins contends that the leaks killed his case because stories
were changed or potential witnesses quit talking after details were
disclosed. Davis changed his story. High went back on part of his.
Some evidence was thrown out after Scott complained that testimony
he provided to Detective Ball had been summarized inaccurately.
</P>
<P>
   But defense attorneys and the NBA argued that the case was
flawed from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation itself began with rumors of a gambling tip,
supposedly furnished by Mokeski and Jack Sikma, also of the Bucks,
to a bartender at an old Valley nightspot, Malarkey's. The two
Bucks reportedly advised the bartender to bet the ``under'' on a
Bucks-Suns game on Feb. 21, 1987, at Veterans Memorial Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The over-under betting line was 226 points, and the Suns lost,
115-107, a victory for the under. The information was allegedly
exchanged over some cocaine provided by the bar manager.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Collins, Keppel and Ball said there was nothing to the
gambling allegations. The self-inflicted blow bloodied their
credibility. It was only a matter of time before defense attorneys
would finish the job. Skepticism was furthered by California's
refusal to honor a fugitive complaint filed against Bratz. The
implication was clear: Law enforcement in a neighboring state
didn't think much of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Then High died.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hurt our prosecution a little bit,'' said Collins, who
continues to argue that changes in Davis' story were insurmountable
for prosecutors. &QL; 
Not ordinary guys &QL; 
Erosion in Collins' case undoubtedly pleased the NBA, whose
officials were angered by what they saw as misuse of the league's
drug policy to further police work.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was targeted by law enforcement, the NBA argued, because
he already had admitted to cocaine use. He had talked about it in
newspaper stories and for television cameras. He had spent time in
an NBA-appointed rehabilitation center near Los Angeles during the
1985-86 season. The argument was that it was easy to haul Davis in
front of the grand jury and ask him, under oath, for the names of
suppliers and fellow users.
</P>
<P>
   Other players, the NBA argued, were targeted because their
celebrity put the spotlight on what otherwise might have been just
another drug bust. But it was the celebrity aspect that caused the
most trouble, Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, I didn't have much consideration for the NBA or
even knew that much about sports,'' Collins said. ``I was
surprised, frankly, that the public thought it was a lot more
important than I did. The public reaction was far more than I had
anticipated. I just wanted to treat the players like anybody else,
just like any other guy.'' &QL; 
Just 1 did time &QL; 
Some average, any other guys were caught up in the storm. They were
waiters and bartenders at nightspots the players frequented after
games. Seven were charged on a variety of drug offenses. One was
charged with obstruction of justice. Of the eight, only one did
time. Superior Court Judge Michael Ryan sentenced Terrence Kelly,
then a waiter at Avanti's restaurant, to 30 days in jail for a
charge unrelated to the Suns case.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went before the judge, he told me: `I sure can't
sentence you if I can't sentence Walter Davis,' '' said Kelly, who
had eight Suns-related charges dismissed by Ryan. ``But then he
looked at me and said, `However, there is this other matter of
selling pot to an undercover cop.' They got me on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly sounds today a lot like Scott. He's moved on with his
life. He's a successful liquor salesman in the Valley. There were
lessons from those days, but Kelly said they didn't have to be
learned through what he believes was an overblown case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a real deal,'' Kelly said. ``They thought we were a
bunch of drug dealers. We weren't. We were just guys having fun the
way a lot of people did in those days. You grow up. Hey, the whole
thing put a damper on my life for a while. No doubt about that. It
was tough, but I got through all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly continues to be a sports fan. He applauded Colangelo for
the sports empire he built out of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire the guy, more than anything,'' he said. ``Look at
what he did for the town.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kelly stays in touch with Bratz, now an old friend.
He also has had Suns season tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three rows back,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   From his seat at America West Arena, Kelly can see a symbol of
that troubled time. It is a remnant that angers him to this day.
Davis' old jersey number, 6, hangs alongside numbers worn by Dick
Van Arsdale, Connie Hawkins, Alvan Adams and Paul Westphal.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns retired it a few years ago in a ceremony that resulted
in an emotional standing ovation. The crowd forgave Davis, the
all-time leading scorer in the franchise's 30-year history. But
Kelly said Davis doesn't deserve the honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry shouldn't have done that,'' Kelly said. ``He (Davis)
brought down his friends, teammates and some other people, who
didn't deserve to be treated that way. It hurt me. It hurt Bratz.
Edwards didn't have any fun with it, I know that. We tagged along
with him. What I did is my fault. But for him to go scot-free just
isn't right.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, the retirement of Davis' number was a rite of passage.
Davis played in a different building, Veterans Memorial Coliseum.
When his number was given an honored spot at America West Arena, it
was an acknowledgement that he had a lot to do with all that
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it was good. A generation of Suns fans grew up watching
Davis' graceful moves and jump shots along the baseline. He was
Michael Jordan's basketball model. He provided Phoenix and the
league a hint of what about to emerge with Jordan's brilliant play.
Davis was a reason to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the profound irony is that Davis' most important role in
Suns history came about because he was the central figure in a
crisis that forced a remake of the team and its city. Davis marks
the first step in a series of changes that continue. &QL; 
Rising from the ashes &QL; 
Opportunity sprang from the crisis. It's Phoenix, in name and fact.
America West Arena, Bank One Ballpark and the Diamondbacks grew
from the abyss.
</P>
<P>
   But the price was steep. For some, it's forgotten. Paid in full.
For others, it's still there, like some old debt that can never be
wiped off the books.
</P>
<P>
   For Colangelo and the city, from crisis to skyline, 1987 and
1999 are part of a single continuum.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the case broke, I'm sure it was a particularly painful
time for Mr. Colangelo,'' Collins said. ``But the whole team went
on to much bigger and better things. From a distance, it looks like
it all worked out for the best, at least for the Suns and Mr.
Colangelo.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, I didn't realize how much the basketball
team was tied to big money, stadiums and downtown development.
Everything was so intertwined. I guess I never appreciated all of
the ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of downtown seemed to hinge on what happened to that
basketball team. Like I said, it was a real eye-opener.''
</P>
<P>
   It still is. &QL;

NO. 1 CHOICE IN ENTRY DRAFT NOT CLEAR CUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay Lightning keeps telling anyone who will listen
that the club will not trade away the No. 1 overall pick in the
upcoming June entry draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I traded the pick, the fans would kill me,'' said
Coach/General Manager  &UR; Jacques Demers. ``I'd come walking out of a
restaurant and they'd shoot me and never find who did it. Are you
kidding me?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, don't be surprised if he trades it anyway. And here's why.
Unlike last year's draft class, which featured top-pick  &UR; Vincent
 &UR; Lecavalier, &UR; whom Tampa promptly plucked, this year's crop of top
picks isn't as certain as it was months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The player most scouts expected to go No. 1,  &UR; Patrik Stefan,
recently suffered his second concussion of the season while playing
for the Long Beach Ice Dogs in the International Hockey League.
It's the third one of his young career, and now there are some
questions as to his future.
</P>
<P>
   The next-best prospects are twins  &UR; Daniel and  &UR; Henrik Sedin from
Sweden, but they are telling teams they plan to remain in Europe
for another season and they don't want to be separated. They've
played on the same teams since they were 5, and they want whoever
takes them to put a package together to bring them both to the same
NHL team, which isn't likely to happen.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is goal-scorer extraordinaire  &UR; Pavel Brendl from
Calgary in the Western Hockey League. He's scored 70 goals this
season, but he's reportedly a head case who takes too many games
off and tends to coast.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever ends up with the No. 1 pick will have some interesting
decisions to make, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'll see a few of the teams who pick high scrambling
on draft day to trade down,'' one NHL scout said. ``But you might
not find too many takers.'' &QL; 
Say that again?
</P>
<P>
   Just when it looked like  &UR; Jaromir Jagr's silly feud was over
with Penguins Coach  &UR; Kevin Constantine, it reared its ugly head
again when some of Jagr's comments to a Czech Republic newspaper
made their way back to Pittsburgh via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the way he prepares the team, and I'm not the
only one among the players,'' Jagr reportedly told the Prague
newspaper ``MF'' ``Dnes.'' ``His communication with us is just
awful. Either he yells at us, or he just hides someplace. Right
now, it's just impossible to talk to him.''
</P>
<P>
   But wait, there's more.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can turn below-average players into at least average
ones,'' Jagr said, ``but he also does everything he can to turn top
players into average ones, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Confronted by a beat writer about the remarks, Jagr became
agitated and didn't wish to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about it,'' he said. ``Do what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he apparently shouted some obscenities and refused to talk
altogether. Constantine's response?
</P>
<P>
   ``Those (comments) are water under the bridge as far as I'm
concerned.'' &QL; 
Tough times for Robinson
</P>
<P>
   His contract is up after this season, and Los Angeles Kings
Coach
 &UR; Larry Robinson, rumored to be leaving for Montreal this summer,
doesn't sound as if he plans to be back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. It's been a tough year,'' he said. ``When even
my wife is finding it tough, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, whose last-place Kings have fallen to 13 games below
.500, was asked whether these could be his last few days on the
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I think about it,'' he said, ``but it's not something
I think keeps me up at night. What keeps me up at night is not
winning hockey games.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll be a total insomniac if the Kings somehow manage to lose
for the fourth straight time this season to the expansion Nashville
Predators, whom they meet Monday. &QL; 
Oilers find Roy offensive
</P>
<P>
   After barely missing a chance at an empty-net goal earlier this
season against Philadelphia, Colorado Avalanche goalie  &UR; Patrick Roy
decided he'd take a couple of chances with the net unguarded last
Saturday during a game against the Edmonton Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers, though, took exception because of the way Roy went
about it. He strayed well away from the crease and into corners for
loose pucks to try to fling a shot down toward the other end, which
infuriated Edmonton players and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling: ``He's got an ego bigger than the Goodyear blimp,''
Oilers assistant coach  &UR; Ted Green said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the last minute, we're pressing and Patrick is making a
mockery of the game by trying to score,'' forward  &UR; Doug Weight
said.
</P>
<P>
   Coach  &UR; Ron Low said his team should be allowed to bowl Roy over
if he's going to stray from the nets like that in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Roy took it all in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they respect my shot because they were all ready at
the blue line,'' he said. ``I tried (to score). I had my chances.
Maybe it's going to come one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy and the Avalanche meet the Oilers again on Friday in
Colorado. Could be interesting, unless the Avs start Roy the night
before against Calgary and give him the day off against Edmonton. &QL; 
Squawking Ducks
</P>
<P>
   They're in a slump, but that hasn't stopped the Mighty Ducks
from doing a little chirping lately.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Anaheim would have to face Detroit or Colorado in
the first round by finishing sixth or seventh in the West instead
of fifth, where they have been for most of the season, high-scoring
forward  &UR; Teemu Selanne said fifth place is definitely the way to
go.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a way better situation, to play against
Phoenix,'' Selanne said. ``That's our goal right now. We don't have
anything else on our mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mighty Ducks are 2-1-2 this season against the Coyotes, whom
they meet today. They are 1-3 against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think we have a chance to even beat Detroit,'' Selanne
said, ``but I think it would be a big difference to play Phoenix.
If we look at our record against Detroit, it's not as good as it is
against Phoenix.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Paul Kariya said he also would prefer to meet the Coyotes, but
after a 1-4-1 slide, he wisely cautions that the Mighty Ducks
shouldn't take any team lightly. Especially now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost our desperation once we clinched the playoffs,''
Kariya said. ``We've got to get it back because we're not a good
enough team to float. Our whole game is awful.'' &QL;

`SHARK' CIRCLING  
 NORMAN IN POSITION TO STRIKE AT MASTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. - Tied for the lead, Greg Norman watched his ball
take flight, blue eyes upturned, his tanned hard-cast face
squinting into the afternoon sun.
</P>
<P>
   Over the water. Over the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. Oh no ''.`` .''`` .''``''
</P>
<P>
   In sympathy, the spectators groaned, a familiar sound at this
picturesque little theater nestled in Amen Corner, the most famous
par 3 in golf. Norman recognized the sound. He knows it well.
</P>
<P>
   His nickname is the Shark but he is known by other aliases. The
Choker. Mr. Heartbreak. The No. 1 Victim of Golf's Inexorable Fate.
A Disaster Waiting To Happen.
</P>
<P>
   The Man Who Can't Win The Masters was tied for the third-round
lead. But not for long.
</P>
<P>
   Norman soon found himself behind the 12th green where no one
wants to be. Bending over, he sighed. He peered into a thick bush.
His ball had to be there ``somewhere.'' But where was it hiding?
The clock ticking, his heart sinking, Norman parted the foliage
with both hands, up to his elbows in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   His caddie joined in the search. Even his playing partner, Lee
Janzen, helped them look. From afar they could have been kids at a
backyard party, hunting for colored eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Norman's head-shaking history is well documented. The man has
lost numerous major championships in ways that defy belief and
mathematical odds.
</P>
<P>
   Norman lost the 1986 PGA when Bob Tway holed out from a sand
trap on the last hole. A year later The Masters slipped away in a
sudden-death playoff when Larry Mize performed a miracle in the
purple twilight, making a 140-foot chip.
</P>
<P>
   Norman led the 1996 Masters by 6 shots after Saturday. ``Shark
Smells Blood'' the banner headline in the ``Augusta Chronicle''
warned. On Sunday, the only blood in the water was his own.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Faldo won. Norman was runner-up, for the third time. The
biggest collapse in Masters history inspired comparisons with the
'64 Phillies and the Hindenburg disaster. A multimillionaire,
Norman owns a fleet of expensive cars. It was said that day that
the Titanic went down and took four Ferraris with it.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a way to lose a major Norman surely can find it. On
Saturday his optimism dimmed when he lost his ball. ``Mystifying,'
he said later.
</P>
<P>
   Penalized 1 stroke, Norman marched grimly back to the 12th tee.
The gallery's heart went out to him. ``I don't think there was one
individual who didn't want to see me hit the green,'' Norman said.
``They didn't want me to make a six or an eight and take myself out
of the tournament. They know what the anguish is. I could feel
their emotions.'' Their support. ``It's the most I've ever felt in
golf.''
</P>
<P>
   After Norman had shoulder surgery last year critics and skeptics
wrote his obituary. But the 44-year-old Australian isn't finished
and he showed me something Saturday. Courage. Determination. Grit.
</P>
<P>
   Norman landed his second tee shot onto the green. Then he rammed
in a 22-foot putt to save bogey. Another bogey followed on the
par-five 13th hole after he laid up with his second shot and his
ball landed in a sandy divot. Murphy's Law.
</P>
<P>
   This man who carries a trunk load of emotional baggage sensed
his round, and his chances, slipping away. ``I had to fight hard to
keep my composure,'' Norman admitted.
</P>
<P>
   But he came back, with birdies on two of the last four holes,
including the 18th, and at day's end the Man Who Can't Win The
Masters found himself alone in second place trailing Jose Maria
Olazabal by 1 shot.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't sure whether the public views him as the sentimental
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you determine that? From '96 or because I'm getting
old,'' Norman joked, flashing his toothpaste-ad smile.
</P>
<P>
   He long ago gave up trying to foresee the future, saying, ``I
don't know what my destiny is.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman's swing doctor, David Leadbetter, won't offer a
prediction either. ``The losses have an effect,'' Leadbetter said.
``We're trying to eradicate those. . . But I can't control the
brain. . .''
</P>
<P>
   No, but Greg Norman's name is on the big board, again. He has
worked hard to give himself another opportunity to win the
tournament he covets more than any other, and, if by chance he
does, what a story that would be. &QL;

AMEN CORNER SHOULD DECIDE IT

<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ For some, the nightmares are real. Others can
only imagine. Both will come together today in a violent mental
collision at The Masters, where the three most terrifying words
uttered at Augusta National will once again be on everyone's lips.
</P>
<P>
   The back nine.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Maria Olazabal, the Spaniard who won here in 1994, has been
through the fabled war zone on a previous Sunday. He recalls the
final nine holes against Tom Lehman that year, which ended with
Olazabal out front by 2 strokes, chiefly the result of a brilliant
eagle at the 15th hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I won here in '94, I think virtually everybody was
rooting for Tom,'' said Olazabal, who watched Lehman miss birdie
after birdie coming down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be pretty much like that (today). Everyone will be
rooting for Greg, after what happened to him here (in 1996). It
might make it just a little bit more difficult, but that's what
we're here for.''
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal knows. He realizes that his 1-stroke lead is tentative
at best against Norman entering the final fray. And if the Great
White Shark doesn't get him, maybe Steve Pate, the human birdie
machine, or supersolid David Love III, each 2 shots back, might get
the job done.
</P>
<P>
   There are others of merit, such as Ernie Els and Lee Janzen (3
off the pace); Steve Elkington, Colin Montgomerie and Nick Price (4
back); and even Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson (down by 5).
</P>
<P>
   ``When you reach the back nine, you have to be good, and you
have to be tough,'' said Olazabal, whose 1-over 73 was good enough
to keep the lead at 7-under 209 on a sunbaked, sometimes windy day.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I find it very difficult to score on the front nine. And
the start is so important here if you're to have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal, who had opened the day with a 3-stroke lead, lost his
advantage by the sixth hole, where he made his second bogey. But
eight straight pars through the most dangerous stretch of the
course, coupled with a birdie at the ever-difficult 15th got him
back on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough day out there, but I managed to hang on,'' said
Olazabal, who is winning this tournament mostly by not making
mistakes (four bogeys through 54 holes).
</P>
<P>
   Norman also is playing well, but was mystified on this day when
he tee shot at No. 12 _ the famed middle hole of Amen Corner _
became lost in an jasmine bush. After searching for five minutes,
the Shark abandoned the mission, went back to the tee and promptly
stuck his third shot 22 feet from the cup, holing the putt for a
brilliant bogey (if there is such a thing).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll give 500 bucks if anybody can go out and find that ball
on No. 12, because I don't have a clue,'' said Norman, who shot 71.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the ball was found by a CBS camera crew and tournament
officials about 50 minutes after Norman departed. It was deep in a
clump of pine needles and ivy.
</P>
<P>
   Norman has to wonder if he's cursed around here. He also got a
bad lie in a sandy divot on No. 13, which led to yet another bogey.
But Norman insisted afterward that he doesn't have any bad vibes
dating back to '96, when he took a 6-shot lead into the final
round, and lost by 5 to Nick Faldo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't reflect on negative situations,'' said Norman, who has
two British Opens wins but has folded in eight other majors,
including runner-up finishes here in '86 and '87.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where my strength of mind comes in. I don't cry over
spilled milk.''
</P>
<P>
   Love, who also was at 7 under before he took a dip at the 15th,
also will need some strength of mind. His horror stories at the
Masters are limited to a runner-up finish in '95. But in that
tournament, Ben Crenshaw went out and won it with birdies on the
16th and 17th holes rather than Love choking it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rode the roller coaster of emotions,'' said Love, who closed
out his round with four straight pars for a 70. ``But in the end,
I've still got a chance going into (today), and that's all you can
hope for around here.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other highs and lows, like the record-setting seven
consecutive birdies made by Pate beginning at the seventh hole that
led to a tournament-best 65. Scott McCarron felt the extreme, as
his triple-bogey 6 at the 12th knocked him out of a share of the
lead. He finished with a 76 and is 3 under.
</P>
<P>
   But that's Augusta National, it giveth and it taketh away like
no other course in the universe. Over the years, the 11th, 12th and
13th holes have gained a reputation as perhaps the most scary
stretch of golf. Coupled them with the toughened-up 15th, and
that's probably the equation which will determine who wears the
green jacket today.
</P>
<P>
   Norman fully expects the outcome to be settled on those four
holes ``because they're just hard shots to play, and you don't have
any room to bail out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Shinnecock's probably the hardest golf course in the
world to play,'' he said. ``But this one gets there in the last two
days when it's drying fast.''

RANGERS' HELLING HIT HARD AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Reserve outfielder Scarborough Green soon
might become a luxury the Rangers no longer can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Green's destiny could be determined by the performance of the
Rangers' rotation, and that may not be comforting to the
late-inning specialist after last night's 10-0 defeat to the
Anaheim Angels at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got two relievers who've thrown more innings than three
of our starters,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ``That's not a good
sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Rick Helling (0-2) failed to complete the fourth
inning for the second time in as many starts this season, and the
Rangers' bullpen soon will require reinforcements if the rotation
does not begin to pitch deeper into games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't keep going on like this very much longer,'' Oates
said.
</P>
<P>
   Helling's 3 2/3-inning appearance marked the fourth time through
five games that a member of the rotation failed to complete the
fifth inning. Right-hander Aaron Sele, who pitched seven scoreless
innings during Tuesday's 6-0 victory against Detroit, remains the
rotation's only member to surpass the five-inning barrier.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers need a performance similar to the one right-hander
Omar Olivares gave the Angels. Olivares required only 97 pitchers
to complete 7 1/3 scoreless innings in which the Rangers managed
only three singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need is someone to go out and give us seven or eight
strong innings,'' Oates said. ``That would be the best shot in the
arm for our ballclub. I feel like we've got that guy going tomorrow
in Aaron.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling allowed 12 of the 20 batters he faced to reach safely
and departed after surrendering six runs on nine hits and two
walks. His brief appearance forced the bullpen to accumulate
another 4 1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all been in this game long enough to know that this is
going to happen sometimes,'' Helling said. ``You just don't want
this trend to continue. We just haven't had quality starts in four
of these five games.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-handers Mike Morgan and Esteban Loaiza have pitched seven
and 6 1/3 innings, respectively, during their relief appearances.
Morgan, though, will join the rotation and start Tuesday's game
against the Seattle Mariners at The Kingdome, Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   That means the Rangers' seven-member bullpen will be reduced to
six beginning with tonight's game. That makes it even more
imperative that Sele provide the Rangers quality innings tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who earned a berth on the Rangers' Opening Day roster by
hitting .361 (13-for-36) during his final 16 exhibition games,
likely would be the one who pays the price should the Rangers
require a 12th pitcher. Oates envisioned utilizing the 24-year-old
outfielder as a late-inning pinch-runner in close games.
</P>
<P>
   ``One run might not be the difference if we don't start getting
people out,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Green could be optioned to Triple-A Oklahoma in favor of a 12th
pitcher to help what soon could become the Rangers' depleted
bullpen. Right-handers Jeff Zimmerman and Jonathan Johnson likely
would be the favorites to be recalled from Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson (1-0, 3.60) earned the victory for the RedHawks during
Friday's 7-4 triumph against Vancouver. Johnson surrendered two
runs on seven hits and two walks during his five-inning appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman, who impressed the Rangers with his performance this
spring, earned the save during Johnson's start with two innings of
perfect relief that included one strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it gets dark, you never ever think you're going to see
the light at the end of the tunnel again,'' Oates said. ``Believe
me, I've been there, and I promise you that you will.''

JOHNSON FANS 15 IN D-BACKS' WIN OVER BRAVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Diamondbacks' Brian Anderson peered through the
gate of the bullpen in the left-field corner at Turner Field and
watched fellow left-hander Randy Johnson go about his business
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson gave up a run to the Atlanta Braves in the first inning
and another in the second. Anderson noticed a change in him after
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been around him long enough through the spring that we
can tell a lot by his body language,'' Anderson said. ``Even though
we were that far away, we could tell in a heartbeat that he was
getting mad, that he was saying to himself, `All right, I'm going
out and taking control.' His stuff just exploded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned to the guys and said, `I don't think we're going to
be throwing tonight, boys.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's complete-game, six-hit, club record 15-strikeout
performance not only gave the beleaguered bullpen a breather, but
it was like water down the parched throat of a person dying of
thirst in the desert. After four close losses to begin the season,
the Diamondbacks drank from the victory cup, 8-3.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 103rd time that Johnson struck out 10 or more batters
in a game, the 25th time he had fanned 14 or more and the 19th time
for 15 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson threw 125 pitches in seven innings while getting a
no-decision in a season-opening loss in Los Angeles on Monday, and
he threw 123 this time, including 83 strikes. He walked two
Saturday night as compared with six on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That right there was a big difference,'' Johnson said. ``This
was a good win for the team after a couple of heartbreaking losses.
Those are part of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to win our share of games coming back like people
came back on us. Tonight, all the guys battled out there for me and
scored some runs for me. That makes it a lot easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still made some big mistakes today. I went against the book
a couple of times and found that the book was right. But I was able
to adjust. I don't know the hitters (in the National League) like I
would like to, but I think I'll make the adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson relied on his trademark fastball that reached speeds of
97 mph, but it was his slider that had the Braves twisting like a
pretzel, usually swinging and missing. Only Brian Hunter and
Chipper Jones did significant damage to Johnson, hitting solo
homers in the second and sixth innings, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get three off him, you've put in a good night's work,''
Braves Manager Bobby Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Said outfielder Brian Jordan, who had two hits off Johnson: ``If
you don't get to him early, you're in trouble. We didn't get enough
of him, and he was dominating.''
</P>
<P>
   On the field, Braves second baseman Bret Boone was lamenting to
Arizona third baseman Matt Williams about the slider's virtual
invincibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him about the time I was with Cleveland and Kevin
Seitzer had an 0-2 count against Randy (who was with Seattle),''
Williams said. ``The slider looks almost the same as a fastball
leaving his hand, and Kevin was so far out in front of it that when
he took a big cut and missed, the ball hit his front knee and he
went down.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Damian Miller, who came up with three hits and a pair of
RBIs, enjoyed the performance, up close and personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd see Randy on TV strike out what seemed like 30 guys and
you would think, `Man, I'd like to be a part of that sometime,' ''
Miller said. ``You see him stare from behind that glove and even as
a catcher you say, `Wow, this guy means business.' He threw a lot
of sliders today, and they were nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was locked in a 2-2 duel with Atlanta left-hander Tom
Glavine, the 1998 NL Cy Young Award winner, for the first three
innings. Arizona's two runs came in the second on Bernard Gilkey's
one-out solo home run and an RBI double by Miller.
</P>
<P>
   The hit scored shortstop Tony Batista, who had singled. Batista,
who began the season 0-14 entering Friday night's game, went on to
record four more hits, including a solo homer in the fourth, giving
him a club record seven in a row going back to Friday night. He
also had four RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Batista and Miller combined to produce two more runs in the
sixth. Williams, who had three hits, including two doubles, drove
in one run in the seventh and Batista another. Batista drove in
Williams again in the ninth for Arizona's final run.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Buck Showalter said it was good to get the first
victory, particularly since the Braves are one of the top-hitting
clubs in the league, but ``it won't mean anything in less than 24
hours, because we'll be going up against Greg Maddux. Although come
to think of it, it's better than the alternative.'' &QL;

ANGELS' OFFENSE PACKS A WALLOP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ All winter there was talk the Angels needed
another starting pitcher _ someone who could eat up valuable
innings and give the club a chance to win. Omar Olivares thought he
was the guy for the job all along, so he remained patient and
Saturday night he got his chance to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Mission accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares (1-0) produced the best pitching performance by an
Angels starter this season, throwing 71/3 scoreless innings in the
Angels' 10-0 victory over the Texas Rangers before 37,974 at The
Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels offense made things easy for Olivares, getting 19
hits, including four each by Randy Velarde and Garret Anderson. But
Olivares, the No. 5 man in the starting rotation, obviously didn't
need it all.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers got only three hits off him and only one Rangers
baserunner even got as far as second base. The key for Olivares is
control, and Saturday he walked only one.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's had trouble, it's when he'd walk guys, because he's
not a strikeout pitcher,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said.
``Tonight if somebody got on base, he made big pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk about guys you know. . . . If these guys step up and
give you more than you anticipate, it's a surprise. Rick Helling
was a surprise last year because he won 20 games (for Texas). I'm
not saying Omar's going to win 20, but if he pitches consistently
he's going to win a lot for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Rangers, Helling (0-2) pitched the way he
did in his first start this season in an 11-5 loss to the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Helling lasted only 32/3 innings Saturday, getting yanked in the
fourth after allowing six runs and nine hits. The Angels did not
put together a big inning, never scoring more than two in a frame.
But they scored at least once in every inning except the seventh
and ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde was a big part of it, getting a single in the first, a
two-run single in the fourth, a single and run scored in the sixth,
and a single in the seventh. But he wasn't about to pat himself on
the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised because traditionally I'm a slow starter in
April,'' he said. ``All of a sudden I'm getting all these hits, so
I'll take advantage of it. You know how this game is _ you don't
own it, you rent it.
</P>
<P>
   When Todd Greene singled with one out in the fifth inning, every
Angels starter had at least one hit. Besides Velarde and Anderson,
Orlando Palmeiro, Tim Salmon, Troy Glaus, Greene and Matt Walbeck
all had two hits apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Angels would like to have Mo Vaughn, Jim Edmonds and
Gary DiSarcina in the lineup. But they insist it isn't that bad
without them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hear anybody talking about it,'' Anderson said.
``They're gone. What are you going to do? We're not going to sit
here and cry, because the next thing you know we'll be 2-20. . . .
People always talk about what we don't have instead of (the players
we can) field every day. But we have a pretty good team.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen of the Angels' 19 hits were singles, and they didn't
hit even one home run. But they scored runs by moving runners and
putting the ball into play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we've got to do,'' Collins said. ``We should
always play that way anyway. We've got guys that can do some
damage, but we have to do the little things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had everything today,'' Olivares said. ``Great hitting,
good defense, good pitching.''

BATTLE LINES DRAWN AS HOCKEY ARENA VOTE NEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL SOWERS AND DIANA BALAZS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It appeared at first that opponents of a Phoenix Coyotes arena
in south Scottsdale would finance their ``vote no'' campaign by
selling 75-cent cookies and $4 yard-sale dresses.
</P>
<P>
   With just weeks left before a crucial May 18 vote on the
project, they were counting their pennies, up against the hockey
team, a high-profile developer willing to spend more than $100,000
on ads and a savvy political consultant from Dallas with a track
record for delivering ``yes'' votes.
</P>
<P>
   Cookies vs. cash. Goliath on a power play.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, the gap narrowed.
</P>
<P>
   Business interests that might be razed to make way for the $624
million redevelopment of Los Arcos Mall announced that they could
pledge at least $50,000 to A Better Way, a new umbrella
organization for anti-arena factions.
</P>
<P>
   The group was forged after project advocates changed their name
from Don't Let Los Arcos Die to Vote Yes Scottsdale. The
name-changing underscores the high emotion and dizzying stakes
riding on the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In five weeks, Scottsdale residents will decide whether to
approve the formation of a stadium district, a tax-supported plan
that could pave the way for a massive makeover of the fading Los
Arcos into a sports-entertainment complex anchored by the Coyotes'
National Hockey League arena.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale voters aren't the only ones being asked to give
thumbs up or down to sports-entertainment meccas. Mesa residents
will go to the polls on May 18 to vote on a city sales-tax hike to
help pay for a $1.8 billion convention complex and football stadium
for the Arizona Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In Scottsdale, a yes vote would mean about $100 million in
state sales taxes generated in the project over the next decade
would go to the Ellman Cos. and the Coyotes. They say they need the
money to transform the area around Los Arcos into an inviting
collection of shops, restaurants, a convention center and a hotel.
Without the tax break, they warn that Los Arcos will decay further
into ``empty and run-down storefronts.''
</P>
<P>
   Not true, say A Better Way and other opponents.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that a yes vote would destroy a neighborhood by
erecting looming parking garages and a too-tall arena. And they
condemn stadium districts as flagrant corporate welfare, benefiting
the rich and diverting state tax money needed for schools and other
services. They disagree with promoters' insistence that Los Arcos
needs an arena to seduce other businesses and free-spending
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plenty of other plans out there,'' said Alan
Kaufman, a Scottsdale lawyer, chairman of A Better Way.
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming vote could do more than determine the fate of the
arena or the makeover of the Los Arcos area. It could also decide
whether the Coyotes move to Scottsdale or stay in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes have long been dissatisfied with America West Arena,
where 4,300 seats have a limited view of the action on the ice. But
if Scottsdale voters turn down the stadium district, an
entertainment group headed by producer Barry Kemp has offered to
buy the team and keep it in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes owner Richard Burke says he hasn't accepted the offer
and is confident that Scottsdale voters will welcome his team and a
new Los Arcos.
</P>
<P>
   A Better Way wants to make sure that doesn't happen. Now with a
bigger bankroll, the group won't have to depend on bake sales'
profits to pay for television and newspaper ads, or campaign signs
and brochures to try to persuade voters to defeat the stadium
district.
</P>
<P>
   The emotion roiling around the project is not limited to south
Scottsdale. The Coalition of Pinnacle Peak, a powerful slow-growth
faction from north Scottsdale, also is pledging money to help
defeat the stadium district. Its target is ``irresponsible
development, and they think the arena fits that category,'' said
Kaufman, also a COPP member.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the new infusion of green, A Better Way is likely to
be outspent by the pro-project groups 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Kaufman, senior vice presi dent for the Ellman Cos. and no
relation to Alan Kaufman, says his company and the Coyotes and
other contributors plan to spend ``north of $100,000'' on the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Ellman Cos. came off the bench early with television ads in
December. They have also taken out full-page newspaper ads, planted
a thicket of signs throughout Scottsdale and hired political
consultant Carol Reed, who helped win voter approval of the $230
million American Airlines Center in Dallas, set to open in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters are orchestrating their publicity blitz from a pair
of rent-free offices in the largely Ellman-owned Los Arcos Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Action shots of the Coyotes decorate one of the offices. Inside,
volunteers and paid staffers answer phones and punch voter
information into computers.
</P>
<P>
   In an adjoining office, Mark Booth, a paid staffer, answers
questions from visitor Andrew Young, a hockey fan. Pastel drawings
of the entertainment-sports complex are displayed like artwork on
easels, depicting lush landscaping, a home-entertainment and
grocery store, restaurants, movie theaters, a convention center,
500-room hotel and a 20,000-seat arena.
</P>
<P>
   When Young noticed that a giant screen would beam arena events
into the mall, he was pumped. ``No kidding? That would be great,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Young plans to vote yes May 18.
</P>
<P>
   But project opponents worry about what a yes vote will mean to
people like Kathryn Crittenden, 85, who lives at what they call
ground zero, the home closest to the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just sick about it,'' said Crittenden, who has a ``No
Arena'' sign in her manicured front yard.
</P>
<P>
   There's no hope that project backers will win over Crittenden
and voters like her. But both campaigns may have a chance with the
undecideds, including Mike Thomas, who lives about two miles from
Los Arcos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have mixed emotions,'' he said. ``I realize that Los Arcos
has been a negative area for Scottsdale. But some residents here
stand to lose a lot from it. I don't think the needs of the
residents have been addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides claim converts.
</P>
<P>
   The pro faction points to Lynn Doiron, who lives a mile east and
a mile north of Los Arcos. Undecided at first, she now says the
project makes sense. In a show of support, she planted a pro-arena
sign in her yard. The next day, it had been strung with toilet
paper.
</P>
<P>
   Such strong feelings mean votes, and both groups want to get
their messages out by April 19, when early ballots become
available.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the project is just as much about taxes as it is
about hockey or convention centers or a grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge facing both groups is untangling the complex
stadium-district law for confused voters. A Better Way says stadium
districts are tax giveaways for developers. Worse, it says, the
districts are immune from certain property taxes and, with city and
court approval, can condemn businesses, more than 50 in the
redevelopment boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Vote Yes Scottsdale argues that the tax breaks will be a
windfall for Scottsdale and triple the state sales-tax revenues
that sagging Los Arcos generates. And it points out that
condemnation has long been a tool for redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, developers keep half the state sales taxes
generated in the new complex for 10 years. Ellman Cos. says that
would mean $10 million a year over the next decade, money used to
help pay for free parking garages and the convention center.
</P>
<P>
   The other $10 million half in state sales-tax revenues would be
new money to be returned to the state for schools and other
services.
</P>
<P>
   The slogan of project supporters _ ``No New Taxes'' _ is a clear
attempt to distance their plan from the Bank One Ballpark in
Phoenix, which was partly funded by a quarter-cent increase in
Maricopa County sales tax. The hike, which voters didn't get a
chance to vote on, soured many voters countywide on using public
money to build stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   The Ellman Cos. and Coyotes are planning to invest about $400
million in the project, including $140 million for the arena. Even
with the state sales-tax money, the developers will be $120 million
short, and have said they will ask for a share of city sales taxes
produced in the new complex to help fill the gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our challenge,'' said Ellman's Bob Kaufman. ``We are
working with Scottsdale to make that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether Scottsdale can take up the slack is uncertain. The
thought of ``well-heeled developers'' using tax money enrages
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to build an arena, let them pay for it
themselves,'' Alan Kaufman said, adding that diverting state taxes
could sap money from education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools, not skates,'' he said, voicing an anti-arena anthem.
</P>
<P>
   He says opponents don't object to a new mall to revive south
Scottsdale, but one built without an arena and tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these arenas are so attractive,'' he asked, ``wouldn't a
bank finance it?''
</P>
<P>
   But Bud Sampson, who has owned a rental business in south
Scottsdale for more than 30 years, says the sports-entertainment
complex would be a big score for the long-neglected Los Arcos area.
</P>
<P>
   This project, he said, would ``make it a destination for people
to go to.'' &QL;

LAKERS COACH NOT AFRAID TO BENCH STARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Kurt Rambis may have a short tenure as the Lakers head coach,
but at least he's going to do the job on his terms, interim tag or
not.
</P>
<P>
   In a day when many league superstars influence coaching
decisions, practice routines and personnel moves, Rambis has taken
a stand. He has shown he's more than willing to seat both his
superstars,
 &UR; Shaquille O'Neal and  &UR; Kobe Bryant, next to him on the bench if
they're not getting the job done.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis has been pulling O'Neal in late-game situations because
he can't be counted on to hit free throws, such as a game at
Phoenix in which the Suns began fouling O'Neal away from the ball
just to make him shoot.  &UR; Glen Rice won the game with a baseline
jumper as O'Neal watched from the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   And in a game against Utah, Rambis yanked Bryant, who was
getting torched by Jazz forward  &UR; Shandon Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fine with it,'' Bryant told Los Angeles reporters after
the move. ``I told Kurt, `Man, I'm with you.' Now, obviously, I
don't like getting taken out of the game at any point. You want to
play. But I'm always with Kurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect Kurt because he has the (guts) to make those types
of decisions. A lot of coaches, they would just panic and say, `OK,
regardless of what's going on, regardless of the mistakes that
you're making, I'm just going to stick with you, because if we
lose, I can say we lost with our best guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kurt, he really doesn't care about any of that.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal and Rambis have met and talked about Rambis' decision to
avoid ``Hack-a-Shaq'' tactics that teams have employed, and he also
has taken forward  &UR; Dennis Rodman off the floor for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis and O'Neal say they have cleared the air, but it's clear
O'Neal does not like the strategy _ which Rambis employed again
Friday night against Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a player, Kurt is the coach,'' O'Neal said early last
week. ``Whatever he decides to do, I'll always be behind him. But
keep in mind, in any relationship, we're going to have arguments. I
mean, I wouldn't want to date anybody not having any arguments.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, O'Neal may thank Rambis, who is either going to
force O'Neal to improve his free-throw shooting or go down trying.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal is a career 53.5 percent free-throw shooter, and he knows
teams are going to intentionally foul him with the game on the line
to try to make him beat them with his weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, probably,'' O'Neal said. ``But I'd rather get the chance
to prove myself. I've been in that situation before, and I've
knocked them down. I want to prove myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I miss a shot and lose a game, I'll take the blame. And
I'll come back and try to be better next game. But I'd rather be
put in that position.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis, however, is trying to give his entire team the best
chance to win. For that, he deserves respect _ even from his stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fine,'' Rambis said of his relationship with O'Neal.
``He's fine. I know where he's coming from, he knows where I'm
coming from. My ballplayers can speak their mind with me.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal has been out early before games working on his free
throws, and he has told reporters he's trying to go back to the
shooting technique he used early in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize I have to step that part of my game up,'' O'Neal
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis said he thought O'Neal could improve dramatically, and
maybe that's why he's forcing O'Neal to work on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's capable of being between 65 and 70 (percent),''
Rambis said. ``I think that's fairly realistic. But I am in no way
putting any pressure on him. I think he is capable of getting to
that level.''
</P>
<P>
   The underachieving Lakers may not realize it, but Rambis'
approach is exactly what they need. &QL; 
It could be worse &QL; 
At least Rambis doesn't have  &UR; Paul Westphal's &UR; headaches in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal has had to endure a report from ESPN, apparently
unfounded, that the Sonics were ready to mutiny and wanted
assistant  &UR; Nate
 &UR; McMillan to replace Westphal, who is in the first year of a
three-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   And his two stars,  &UR; Vin Baker and  &UR; Gary Payton, got into a
heated argument during a practice the day before Baker returned
from the injured list because of torn thumb ligaments.
</P>
<P>
   During a scrimmage, Baker and Payton reportedly began arguing,
with Payton calling Baker a ``fat (expletive)'' and a ``fake
All-Star.'' At one point, Baker reportedly said, ``So this is
getting personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh, yeah.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the two downplayed the incident, as did Westphal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just Gary and I being competitive,'' Baker said. ``Gary
and I are the best of friends. We're like brothers. We're not going
to let one incident in practice break us apart. We talked it over,
and it's washed.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal said, ``Crazy, stupid things happen in basketball all
the time,'' citing the time he had to make a run for it from an
angered
 &UR; Steve Kuberski during a Boston Celtics' practice and another time
in which  &UR; Charles Barkley pounded on  &UR; Oliver Miller during a Suns
workout. &QL; 
Labels &QL; 
Charlotte interim Coach  &UR; Paul Silas has his sights set on keeping
the job permanently, although the possible sale of at least half
interest in the team to  &UR; Michael Jordan could have an impact on his
future.
</P>
<P>
   But Silas has the Hornets playing respectably again, with the
help of the  &UR; Glen Rice trade that brought  &UR; Eddie Jones and  &UR; Elden
Campbell from the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Silas' name often pops up in coaching searches, but he hasn't
had a head coaching job since he guided the 1982-83 San Diego
Clippers. Silas said he thought he had been labeled as a career
assistant. He got interviews in Chicago, Seattle and Sacramento
last summer, but no offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a stigma, but it is a perception,'' said Silas, a
former Phoenix assistant. ``And it's hard to take. But (good)
things happen when you least expect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornets Vice President  &UR; Bob Bass reportedly has told Silas his
future depends on three factors: wins, improvement and how players
relate to him.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's if Bass is calling the shots when the time for
a decision comes. &QL;

HOME ICE ON THE LINE  
 COYOTES CAN CINCH 4TH SEED WITH WIN IN ANAHEIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Is it really a race to catch Phoenix for the fourth
seed in the Western Conference and the home-ice advantage in the
first round of the NHL playoffs that goes along with it?
</P>
<P>
   Or, is it a three-way dogfight between St. Louis, Anaheim, and
San Jose to win the fifth playoff spot and a match up with the
Coyotes, instead of a playoff meeting with Colorado or Detroit,
which will meet the sixth and seventh place finishers?
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes can eliminate themselves from this scrambled scene
with a win over the Mighty Ducks tonight at Arrowhead Pond, which
would clinch fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix, with 88 points, holds a seven-point edge over St. Louis
and an eight-point margin over the Mighty Ducks with four games
remaining for each team. Any Phoenix win, or a loss by St. Louis
and Anaheim, makes it mathematically impossible for the Coyotes to
be caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it (fourth) is in our hands,'' Coyotes defenseman
Keith Carney said. ``If we concentrate on playing our game and
playing it well, it will take care of itself. I think we are going
to be playing our kind of hockey the rest of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   But Phoenix doesn't have a cake walk ahead. After tonight's
meeting with Anaheim, the Coyotes travel to Dallas, which has
clinched the best record in the NHL, then come home to host St.
Louis and Dallas. Four very loseable hockey games.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the coin is the mad scramble going on for
the fifth, sixth and seventh positions; a race separated by a grand
total of two points.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis has 81 points, followed by the suddenly sagging Mighty
Ducks at 80. San Jose is right behind with 79, although the Sharks
have only three games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting Phoenix tonight, the Mighty Ducks host St. Louis
on Wednesday, travel to crosstown Los Angeles on Thursday and close
the season Saturday in San Jose. St. Louis meets Colorado today,
then goes to Anaheim, visits Phoenix and closes the year at LA.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose finishes on home ice. The Sharks host Edmonton, which
has opened a three-point edge over Calgary for the eighth playoff
spot, Los Angeles and the Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Trends of late? The Coyotes have lost two straight at home and
are 2-3 in their past five. St. Louis and San Jose are 5-3-2 in
their past 10 outings, while the Mighty Ducks have gone 1-4-1 in
their past six, and are 0-3-1 since clinching a playoff spot April
2 against the Rangers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   While the Coyotes were busy blowing a 4-3 decision to Nashville
on Friday night, the Mighty Ducks were putting on a fowl
performance themselves in a 4-1 loss at home to San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were awful,'' star Paul Kariya told the ``Los Angeles
Times'' after the game. ``We didn't do what we talked about. We
didn't work. We didn't play the systems right. You can't win like
this. You can't play like this and expect to win in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has got to give each other a kick in the butt and
get going. We have to get things in gear. You play soft and cheat
for scoring chances in the playoffs and team will kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   If one didn't know better, Kariya could have been standing in
the Phoenix locker room Friday night, doing a perfect imitation of
any one of several Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Think not? A few words from Mr. Carney, explaining the Nashville
debacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took it too easy and played down to their level,'' he said,
disgustedly. ``Even though we had the lead and were in control, we
just didn't put them away. It's disappointing. We want to win games
at this point. We came out hard but didn't sustain it for 60
minutes, which is inexcusable at this time of year.''
</P>
<P>
   The ideal situation for the Coyotes would be to close out
speculation about the fourth seed tonight, enabling them to rest
some players this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we need rest,'' Carney said. ``Our schedule
hasn't been that tough recently; it has been pretty easy on us, and
we'll probably have four or five days off before the playoffs
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more important that we get to playing well and playing
our kind of hockey for 60 minutes. We want to be playing our best
going into the playoffs and have everybody's confidence up.''

FATE OF PRO FOOTBALL-CONVENTION COMPLEX TOO CLOSE TO CALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBBIE SHERWOOD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Voters in Mesa, Gilbert and Queen Creek will go to the polls in
a little more than five weeks to answer the $1.8 billion question:
Hitch or ditch?
</P>
<P>
   Will the East Valley hitch its economic and cultural wagon to
the massive Rio Salado Crossing convention center and football
stadium, or ditch the notion of spending tax money for a
professional sports and convention complex?
</P>
<P>
   Mesa, the nation's 51st-largest city and growing, stands to shed
its non-image as an average city and proud of it to create a name
for itself as a big-time convention destination and Super Bowl
playground, supporters say.
</P>
<P>
   Rio Salado Crossing opponents in Mesa like their city as it is
and loathe the use of taxpayer money to benefit the Arizona
Cardinals. As the May 18 vote nears, the competition for the
relatively few available votes is growing intense, but not in the
way usually associated with big-ticket campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   You won't be hearing television and radio ads about this vote.
The Rio Salado Crossing campaign is well-funded, with the Cardinals
as primary bankroller, but it's not so fat it can waste backfields
of cash selling a stadium to 2 million Maricopa County residents
who can't vote on it.
</P>
<P>
   Only the 219,000 registered voters of Mesa, Gilbert and Queen
Creek can decide the project's fate.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, supporters have adopted a more passive-aggressive
strategy. They're engaged in an intensive person-to-person campaign
that injects the pro-stadium stand into just about any crowd that
gathers in the three voting cities. And they're trying to lock in
``yes'' votes through a concerted push for early voting by mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I see two guys at a bus stop, I'm there talking to them,''
said Kerry Dunne, director of the Rio Salado Crossing Association
and the East Valley Partnership, which supports the project.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign booths were noticeable additions to Chicago Cubs
spring-training games in Mesa and such events as the Airshow
Spectacular at Williams Gateway Airport. Supporters recently
mass-mailed a videotape touting the project, and they meet with up
to four civic organizations, church groups and unions a day.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy was enough to snare the attention of Marc
Jablonowski and family last month at Mesa's Chicagofest blues
festival. A large-scale model of the futuristic Rio Salado Crossing
stadium and convention center was declared cool by Jablonowski's
two young sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's cool, too,'' said Jablonowski, 32, a Mesa
resident who works in electronics. ``If it were just a stadium, I'd
say no way. But I think this is a good economic idea. I travel to a
lot of seminars, and the convention business is huge.''
</P>
<P>
   A campaign staff member of Yes! On Rio Salado Crossing stood
nearby, poised to answer any questions or help potential voters
sign pledges to vote for the project.
</P>
<P>
   The message struck the wrong note with Brian McCord, 38, of
Mesa, who was also at the blues festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can find some way to build it other than raising
taxes, it would be a better idea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State University political pollster Bruce Merrill
describes the stadium backers' strategy of attending sporting and
recreational events as preaching to the converts. It's the wisest
move, he said, with recent polls putting supporters slightly
behind. Voter turnout is expected to be low.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a low turnout, generally it's a matter of who goes to the
polls and who doesn't,'' Merrill said. ``It's in (stadium backers')
interest to go get their people out to vote and not make this a
controversial thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to whether it's going to fail is whether opponents can
have any kind of focused opposition. They need to have a
respectable group or coalition come out against it.''
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers Against Rio Salado is the small but feisty group
taking up the challenge. Its members dog the Yes! On Rio Salado
Crossing crowd at as many stops as they can.
</P>
<P>
   The Yes! campaign's budget has exceeded $250,000; &UR; Against
chairman Manny Cortez would be thrilled if his reached four. But
the group has some political muscle. State Sens. Rusty Bowers and
Tom Freestone, as well as Mesa City Council members Keno Hawker and
John Giles, have declared war on the project.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers instigated a move to kill legislative amendments that
stadium supporters need to make their financing plan work.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium-district law allows a project's developer to
recapture 50 percent of the state sales tax the project generates
for 10 years. Rio Salado Crossing supporters want permission to
begin the 10-year recapture during the construction phase. The law
doesn't address the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Backers expect the amendments to pass eventually. But even if
they're killed, stadium district chairman Marty Whalen said, the
election will go on. It would get more expensive, however, as the
project likely would face lawsuits, or have to shop for a judge's
legal opinion supporting the early recapture.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents made their strongest showing to date during
Chicagofest at Riverview Park _ a fitting site, because the
convention facility and its surrounding shopping plazas, golf
courses and canal walks would occupy this area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not against the stadium, we're just against using tax
money for private enterprise,'' Jan Gurtin said from a makeshift
protest area.
</P>
<P>
   She and Art Kauffman of Sun City, who led anti-stadium efforts
against Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix, handed out protest fliers.
Gurtin isn't from one of the voting cities, but has offered her
services to fight the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from Tempe, and originally this was going to be built in
both cities, so I came down to help out,'' Gurtin said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents couldn't match the endless supply of pro-stadium
stickers and brochures, the glossy display or the cool scale model.
They fought back with Vince Fantozzi, who donned a Cardinals
football helmet and paraded around Chicagofest with a bright-red
sign board that read ``You: play. Me: pay. That's fair, right? Give
me your lunch money, kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents also gave away about three dozen T-shirts. It cost
them $236, leaving the campaign with about $600 in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Yes! On Rio Salado Crossing has spent nearly $200,000, according
to campaign finance reports. Rio Salado Association's Dunne said
the campaign signed up at least 1,200 new supporters during the
three-day Chicagofest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a David and Goliath situation,'' Cortez acknowledged.
``But so what? David won, didn't he?''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters plan to pick up the pace in coming weeks,
distributing 4- by 4-foot campaign signs, Yes! bumper stickers and
displays that can be set up inside sports bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to put on the gas,'' said Brad Wright, executive
director of Yes! On Rio Salado Crossing.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of radio and TV, supporters and opponents alike
have turned to direct mail and early voting.
</P>
<P>
   The Yes! campaign has been gathering pledges of support since
before the project was put on the ballot, and it now has a database
of thousands of promised yes votes. Those supporters will be mailed
request forms for early voting ballots, courtesy of Yes! On Rio
Salado Crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Project opponents want traditionally anti-tax retirees to vote
before they leave for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Stadium foe Bob Powers said supporters ``make it extremely easy
to vote yes on this, so we have to work to get the people who are
not in favor to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Early voting could be key to the campaign. Since the state
changed the law in 1991, making it unnecessary to provide a reason
to receive an early ballot, voting by mail in Mesa elections has
grown from 700 ballots in 1994 to 13,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The county will mail out early ballots beginning Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dunne said, the campaign's focus will continue to be
face-to-face meetings to explain how the project works.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' presence in the campaign has been ubiquitous and
understated. Most of the funding for the campaign is coming from
the Cardinals' checkbook.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have also hosted events where stadium campaigners
do their thing, and the team is at least a supportive presence at
most of the events targeted by the campaign. But Cardinals vice
president Michael Bidwill shies from taking a leading campaign
role.
</P>
<P>
   ```We are part of the project and it's important to us,''
Bidwill said, ``but there are also many other parts to this project
which the community and some leaders are taking an active role
in.''
</P>
<P>
   The pro-stadium campaign's most consistent presence so far was
at Mesa's HoHoKam Park during Cactus League games. Campaign
volunteers or former Cardinals players, such as Garth Jax, engaged
Cubs fans strolling by or stopping at the condiment carts.
</P>
<P>
   Back at Riverview Park, C.A. Cole listened to a campaign spiel
and looked over the model stadium but remained unswayed. The
72-year-old retiree lives less than a mile from the park's lake and
ballfields and doesn't want to see them replaced with restaurants,
privately owned golf courses and, least of all, a behemoth stadium
and convention center.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too many families that enjoy this park to put in a
commercial venture like this,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   Right behind him stood Joe and Kathy McCabe of Phoenix, who wish
they could vote on the project. Joe drives a van for SuperShuttle.
He predicts a huge boost to business with a convention center just
six freeway miles from Sky Harbor International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just don't realize the economic impact of the
convention business in the Valley,'' Joe said. ``But I see it
firsthand, and I see what Scottsdale gets at all those hotels. To
be honest with you, I don't like the economic blackmail of the NFL
offering the Super Bowl if the project passes, but I still think
it's a great project.'' &QL;

COWBOYS GO WITH NEW DRAFT STRATEGY THIS YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys scouting director Larry Lacewell's
office sits on one side of the team's Valley Ranch headquarters,
far away from the cozy confines of Cowboys owner/general manager
Jerry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Lacewell might be 62 years old, but he hears very well.
</P>
<P>
   From his position, the criticism leveled at Jones for the
Cowboys' drafts the past five years are really grievances against
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry needs a football man, they say,'' Lacewell said. ``I've
been in this business for 43 years. I think I know a little bit
about football.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson, who has credited Lacewell
with teaching him more about football than any other person.
</P>
<P>
   So what gives with the Cowboys' draft shortfalls since Johnson's
bitter departure as coach after the 1993 season? Forty-four picks
in the past five drafts have resulted in just six starters and just
one Pro Bowl-caliber performer, tackle Larry Allen.
</P>
<P>
   And what hope do Cowboys fans have that things will be different
in the 1999 draft next weekend?
</P>
<P>
   Lacewell points to a change in philosophy, born partially out of
necessity and partially out of design.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, he said, are going into the draft looking to take
``the best athlete available'' with their top pick rather than
trying to fill a specific need, as they've done in recent years.
The Cowboys, who have eight selections, own the 22nd pick in the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful feeling,'' said Lacewell of the best-athlete
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Lacewell said the Cowboys are in that position because they've
worked to address their most pressing needs in free agency. The
Cowboys are confident wide receiver Raghib Ismail, linebacker
Quentin Coryatt and center Mark Stepnoski, all free agents, will
sign with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it happens very often that you are in position
to draft the best athlete,'' Lacewell said. ``This day and age with
the cap and free agency, when you lose a player and you need to go
get a guy. It goes back to the draft.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said the Cowboys have no choice but to
adopt that credo because of their low-draft position.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we pick, you can't look at a certain position because you
don't know what you are going to get at 22,'' Gailey said. ``You
have to take the best athlete available.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' top pick could come from one of five positions _
wide receiver, offensive line, defensive line, linebacker and
defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   The team slightly tipped its hand about which positions it
covets the most this past weekend when it hosted 20 prospects for a
visit. The group was dominated by linebackers, wide receivers and
defensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   Among the top players who could slide to the Cowboys at No. 22
are Tennessee linebacker Al Wilson, LSU defensive tackle Anthony
McFarland and receivers Troy Edwards of Louisiana Tech and Kevin
Johnson of Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Lacewell, who said the Cowboys aren't leaning in any direction,
is just glad to have options. And while he said some of the
criticism the Cowboys have received for their drafts is unfair, he
acknowledges some mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a blind ego,'' Lacewell said. ``We know we made
mistakes, and mistakes are part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacewell said part of the team's problems the past five years
was that few starting spots were open. Shante Carver was brought in
to back up defensive end Charles Haley in 1994. In 1995, running
back Sherman Williams was drafted to be a backup for Emmitt Smith.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't explain the team's No. 1 pick in 1996, however. The
Cowboys wanted Texas defensive end Tony Brackens, but gambled that
they could move down into the second round and get him and
linebacker Randall Godfrey. Jacksonville nabbed Brackens, forcing
the Cowboys to ``reach'' for Kavika Pittman with their first pick
because of their need for an end.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman's slow development has caused the Cowboys to continue to
be haunted by that decision. Last year, they again took a defensive
end, Greg Ellis, with their top pick, the third time in five years
they've used their first pick on a defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   Just seven players remain on the team from the 26 taken in the
1994, 1995 and 1996 drafts combined. If not for Allen, 1994 might
have been one of the worst drafts in Cowboys history.
</P>
<P>
   Lacewell said the Cowboys have learned and moved forward _
pointing to solid draft classes of 1997 and 1998, though they
drafted for need first both years. All nine picks in 1997 made the
team as rookies and the top two picks _ tight end David LaFleur
(first round) and linebacker Dexter Coakley (second round) _ are
firmly entrenched as starters. Only five of those players are still
on the roster, however.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the nine from last season are still on the team. Ellis
started as a rookie and is considered to be a longtime fixture on
the Cowboys' defensive line. Second-round pick Flozell Adams, an
offensive lineman, might the best selection since Allen. He started
10 games as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Of Adams, Lacewell says it was a case of the Cowboys being
patient that he would be available in the second round and then
``taking the best player available.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what they plan to do for the entire draft this time
around.

THE BREAK DOWN THAT STARTED IT ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The beginning of the 1987 drug investigation and
attempted prosecution of Suns players by Valley law enforcement
authorities can be traced to an earlier date and a different city.
</P>
<P>
   The day: Dec. 12, 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The place: Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   That's the when and where of Walter Davis' first reported
problems with cocaine. The day after Davis scored a career-high 47
points in a Suns victory at Golden State, he notified the NBA that
he wanted treatment for cocaine and alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Al Bianchi remembers the day, perhaps the most stunning in the
30-year history of the Suns. At the time, Bianchi was a Suns
assistant to then-head coach John MacLeod.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the Suns' career leading scorer, could not be reached for
comment. He is living in Denver, where he played for the Nuggets
from 1988 through 1992. He then worked as a broadcaster for the
Nuggets and had been part of the team's community-relations
department until last year.
</P>
<P>
   Davis missed the Suns' flight on the morning after his brilliant
play at Golden State. In those days, NBA teams flew commercial,
instead of charter.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, he had been seen by teammates in a bar at an
Oakland hotel near the airport. The Suns and other visiting NBA
teams stayed there in those days.
</P>
<P>
   The bar was a notorious nightspot that always was jammed after
Golden State games. The place was jokingly compared with the weird
bar crowd in ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis left the bar near closing time and, as it turned out,
wasn't seen again by his teammates for nearly a month.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, not much was thought about his absence. On the
morning of Dec. 13, the Suns flew from Oakland to Los Angeles,
where they were scheduled to play the Lakers that night. There were
plenty of flights. The assumption was that Davis would board a
later one, pay a fine and be in uniform at tip-off.
</P>
<P>
   But by midday, it was clear there were problems.
</P>
<P>
   MacLeod sent Bianchi back to Oakland. Bianchi, now a Suns scout,
remembers that he found Davis in his Oakland hotel room with Al
Attles, then Golden State's general manager. Attles had rushed to
help when he heard Davis was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was literally sobbing,'' Bianchi said of the 6-foot-6
swingman, whose jersey, No. 6, hangs high above the seats at
America West Arena. It was retired by the Suns a couple of years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   From Oakland, Davis went to Van Nuys, Calif., where he entered a
rehabilitation center that had been selected by the NBA upon its
1983 adoption of a drug policy. The league had imposed that policy
after former New York Knicks guard Michael Ray Richardson's widely
publicized substance-abuse problems.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, former Atlanta Hawks forward John Drew and two
former Houston players, Mitchell Wiggins and Lewis Lloyd, underwent
treatment and were eventually suspended by the league before Davis
spent 28 days in rehab. He returned to the Suns on Jan. 13, 1986.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than a year later, Davis was brought in by
Maricopa County prosecutors and Phoenix police to testify to a
grand jury about where and from whom he had acquired cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Indictments were handed down on April 16 and announced at a news
conference the next day. Davis was back in rehab for a second
28-day stretch that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' drug problems stunned the Suns and Phoenix fans, who saw
him as a model citizen. There were no signs.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, recognition of potential drug problems was not a
skill of most basketball coaches in those days. MacLeod said he
hadn't seen the signs.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, he couldn't have seen them. He didn't know what they
were.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know what we know now,'' said Bianchi, a former
Seattle SuperSonics head coach who also was the New York Knicks
general manager from 1987 through 1991. ``If we had, we could have
helped Walter right away.'' &QL;

HIGH'S DEATH STILL PUZZLES AFTER 12 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Johnny High died nearly 12 years ago, but suspicion
that his death was the result of foul play is still alive.
</P>
<P>
   In the early-morning hours of June 13, 1987, High was alone,
driving a blue 1979 Mazda RX-7. The estimated time was 2 a.m.,
according to police reports.
</P>
<P>
   High was traveling east on Jefferson Street about 35 mph. His
vehicle went through the right-hand turn lane at 20th Street and
slammed into a utility pole.
</P>
<P>
   When police arrived at the scene, High, 30, was reported to be
unconscious. He was taken to Maricopa Medical Center, where he died
about 3:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   A toxicology report showed his blood-alcohol level at 0.11
percent. Under Arizona law, drivers with a blood-alcohol level of
0.10 percent are considered intoxicated. According to accident
investigators, High took no evasive action. There were no skid
marks in the intersection.
</P>
<P>
   The Maricopa County Medical Examiner's office ruled that the
death was accidental. According to the report, High suffered a
crushing chest injury when he hit the steering wheel at the moment
of impact. He was not wearing a seat belt.
</P>
<P>
   But the hour of the accident, the relatively low speed and
High's role as a grand jury witness in an ongoing drug case against
former Suns teammates left behind questions. Doubts that still
exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I drive by 20th Street and Jefferson, I wonder what
happened there,'' said Dick Todd, a former police detective who
today runs a Valley drug-screening company.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, High was working part time for Todd in his
investigation business. High sold shoes during the day and worked
as a process server for Todd during the evenings.
</P>
<P>
   Todd recalls that High had begun to complain about threats. The
former Suns guard wasn't specific. But, Todd said, he was worried.
In a tearful interview with Channel 12 before the crash, High said
he had been threatened after it became known that he had provided
damaging information against three people who were indicted.
</P>
<P>
   After his death, Channel 12 sportscaster Mark Curtis said in an
editorial that he was sure High had been murdered. Curtis didn't
provide any solid evidence to support his contention. Curtis said
he continues to believe that High was a victim of foul play.
</P>
<P>
   What really happened?
</P>
<P>
   If anybody knows for certain, he or she hasn't talked.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to retrace High's steps on that fateful night, there
are several scenarios. He was seen at a bar near Chris-Town Mall
and then another one near Metrocenter. There were reports that he
then showed up with an unidentified professional athlete at an
after-hours club in south Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   There also were reports of a car chase on Interstate 10, near
the 16th Street exit. But to this day, a reliable witness to the
accident has never stepped forward. At 2 a.m., there is little
traffic at 20th and Jefferson streets. The site is surrounded by
warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators at the time theorized that High might have fallen
asleep at the wheel. An independent expert, Ed Maciag, ruled out
suicide and/or foul play. A problem with the brakes or some other
mechanism in the vehicle was not reported. In the collision, the
light pole penetrated 21 inches into the nose of the car.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Collins, the Maricopa County attorney at the time, is
convinced High died in an accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do recall a great deal of controversy about what happened
there,'' said Collins, adding that High's death did some small
damage to the prosecution of his case. ``But the accident report
indicated pretty clearly that he probably fell asleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every little indicator showed that it was not a suicide or a
deliberately caused crash. None of that was there. Every indicator
aligned with the thesis that it was simply an accident.''
</P>
<P>
   But Todd is one among many who remains unconvinced. He said
there is no way to prove exactly what caused the death of High, a
reserve guard for the Suns between 1979 and 1984.
</P>
<P>
   High's grave is in Bessemer, Ala., his hometown, which is
located about 10 miles southwest of Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   One of his former Phoenix teammates, Alvin Scott, said he often
thinks about High.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a wall at my house where I keep team photos from my
eight years with the Suns,'' Scott said. ``He was a teammate, a
friend. I remember him that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, no, I never think about what happened on that night.
We'll just never know. There could be a million stories out there.
It'll always be kind of a mystery, I think.'' &QL;

JOHNSON'S EYE FOR TALENT FREQUENTLY SHOWS IN DRAFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Much as he did during his days in Dallas, Miami Dolphins coach
Jimmy Johnson is using a keen eye for talent and multiple picks in
the college draft to build a perennial playoff team.
</P>
<P>
   Since Johnson joined the Dolphins as head coach and general
manager before the 1996 season, he has retooled a roster of old
players, adding eight starters through the draft. According to a
draft formula devised by the Star-Telegram, only the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers have drafted better than Johnson over the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy is the only coach I've worked for that personally
interviews his own assistant coaches and the individual scouts
one-on-one about a particular player _ he knows everything about a
guy on draft day,'' said Tom Braatz, the Dolphins' director of
college scouting.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson often trades down in the draft to obtain extra picks.
With more picks, he has more chances of hitting on a player.
Johnson selected a league-high 26 players in his first two drafts.
With the last of three picks in the fifth round of 1996, he landed
linebacker Zach Thomas, who in 1998 turned out to be the club's
first first-team All-Pro since offensive tackle Richmond Webb and
place-kicker Pete Stoyanovich in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people probably overlooked Zach because of his
height,'' said Braatz of Thomas, who is 5-foot-11. ``Jimmy doesn't
care about height. He cares about whether or not the guy makes
plays. That is his only criteria.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins are still an offensive weapon or two from being
considered a legitimate Super Bowl contender. And this is where
Johnson has had trouble drafting. He has been much more adept at
drafting defensive players than offensive players.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, for example, he wanted to draft Baylor linebacker
James Francis and had to ``settle'' for Emmitt Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's misjudging of offensive talent has followed him to
Miami. Of the eight starters he has drafted, all but running back
Karim Abdul-Jabbar (third round, 1996) and fullback Stanley
Pritchett (fourth round, 1996) have been defensive players.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas (fifth round, 1996) was a first-team All-Pro in 1998.
Defensive linemen Daryl Gardener (first round, 1996), Jason Taylor
(third round, 1997), and Kenny Mixon (second round, 1998), and
linebacker Derrick Rodgers (third round, 1997) have started at
least 75 percent of the time for a defense that ranked third
overall in 1998. Cornerback Sam Madison led the team in
interceptions in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most of the offensive players Johnson has drafted have not
been productive. Johnson spent a No. 1 on wide receiver Yatil Green
in 1997 and a No. 1 on running back John Avery in 1998. Green,
because of injuries, has not played in an NFL game. Avery fumbled
five times and averaged 3.5 yards per rush as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Dolphins are pleased with their recent drafts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to draft the best football player, not the guy who
runs the fastest or is maybe the strongest,'' Braatz said. ``We're
still working, but we'd like to think we've done a good job.''

 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In an NBA date that would make even Clint Eastwood
flinch, the good and the bad seemed to join forces to produce more
ugly than anyone could use.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news was delivered in front of 12,853 at the Pond by the
Portland Trail Blazers, whose fullcourt defensive maneuvers
transformed their 20-3 hole into a 97-70 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after mauling the Utah Jazz in Anaheim, the league's
worst team _ that would be the 4-31 Clippers _ began this one by
mugging the team with the league's best record. The Clippers, who
tripped Minnesota on Thursday, were attempting to win two in a row
for the first time in about 450 days.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes after tipoff, Arvydas Sabonis, Portland's 7-foot-3
center, was accused and convicted of his second personal foul. This
legal precedent inspired a basket assault by Clippers forward
Maurice Taylor and center Michael Olowokandi, who equally split 12
points en route to a 22-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Dunleavy promptly summoned his subs, who have provided the
Blazers coach with more bench mileage than anyone since Forrest
Gump. And with 6-11 forward Rasheed Wallace as point man on the
press, the Blazers closed it to 27-16 at the end of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers were ridiculous in the second period, finishing
with the same number of points as turnovers (11). Their doom was
accelerated by Taylor's third foul on a rebound skirmish with 8:20
before the half.
</P>
<P>
   And Portland's fullcourt trap was devastating.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers took advantage of several transition opportunities
to pile up 33 second-quarter points. Nine of those came from Walt
Williams and seven were added by Wallace, who spent most of his
time in orbit around the east-end rim.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the third quarter was finished the Clippers trailed
74-54. The Blazers looked as though they were worth every penny
that's been spent by owner Paul ``Microsoft'' Allen.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers simply performed like the best team money can
bypass.

<P>
   What a wonderful celebration the Atlanta Braves put on Thursday
night to honor the often-forgotten accomplishments of  &UR; Hank Aaron,
who is arguably baseball's greatest living player.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron's low-key and dignified manner often made it easy to
overlook the feats of the quiet leader of the Milwaukee/Atlanta
Braves for so many years. Even after he returned to Milwaukee to
finish out his career with the Brewers, he had a way about him that
made that then-young club realize how fortunate they were to be
playing baseball for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever a discussion ensues over the greatest players ever,
Aaron's name quite often is left out. It's not because someone
might not believe Aaron belongs on such a list, it's just that his
effortless style often made baseball fans believe he was not giving
his all every moment he was on the field.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, Aaron was so gifted he made playing the game look
too easy. He glided through baseball games, never appearing to work
up a sweat. When it's all said and done, Aaron deserves to be
listed among the top five players ever.
</P>
<P>
   Put whoever you want in the other four slots, but Aaron's
accomplishments, highlighted by his major league record 755 home
runs, deserve the most select company.
</P>
<P>
   We should never forget what Aaron went through on and off the
field in the days, weeks and months leading up to his eclipsing
 &UR; Babe Ruth's home run record. That Aaron did not allow us to know
of the pain and exact harshness of some of those ugly letters and
phone calls at the time, speaks volumes about Aaron the man.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he is the epitome of grace and elegance, an equal to
 &UR; Joe
 &UR; DiMaggio in that respect, but someone who went through so much more
grief than most human beings will ever know.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron is a true American hero, more than worthy of all the
praise he has received through the years and someone we should all
make an effort to remember. &QL; 
Trivial question &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Name the nine active players on big-league rosters who have been
with their current club for at least 10 years and have never played
for another major league club. &QL; 
Return of the Bronx Zoo? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tired of  &UR; George Steinbrenner's meddling during the last week,
interim Yankees Manager  &UR; Don Zimmer openly chastised the Yankees
boss as few have during the 27 years since Steinbrenner bought the
Yankees away from CBS for $13 million (who advised CBS on that
deal?).
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Steinbrenner basically insisted  &UR; Hideki Irabu
should have started last Wednesday's game, Zimmer asserted his
intention to defy Steinbrenner and wound up starting  &UR; Ramiro
Mendoza, who turned in eight shutout innings before Irabu pitched a
scoreless ninth in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Steinbrenner) has done a lot of good things for me,'' Zimmer
said. ``He's been good to me, but I always tried to do the right
thing working for George Steinbrenner, too. I can't sit here and be
a little wimp and scared of something. I haven't been scared of my
job in my life, and I'm not scared of it now.''
</P>
<P>
   They are words that so many previous and current employees would
love to tell Steinbrenner. Surprisingly, it's the type of response
Steinbrenner respects more than any other, those who have worked
for him have said. After all, this is a man who basically devours
those who show weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would resign if Steinbrenner tendered an ultimatum,
Zimmer responded, ``It won't be resigning if something happens,
I'll quit. I'm not saying I'm quitting. But there ain't nobody who
is going to tell me one thing and then double-talk on something
else. I mean, I ain't going to buy it.'' &QL; 
The Queen's Zoo? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the New York Mets' 6-2 opening day loss in Florida, the
``New'' ``York Pos''t's back-page headline screamed, ``$75M Flop.''
One caller to the Big Apple's lead sports radio station was
seriously concerned about ``a pattern developing'' that he did not
like.
</P>
<P>
   Almost on cue, the Mets' front office and staff went bonkers
after reading the coverage of their loss, to the point where the
``Post'' ran a second-day story with the headline ``Phillips: It's
Way Too Early To Write Us Off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was humorous,'' Mets General Manager  &UR; Steve Phillips said.
``It was more like, `You've got to be kidding me.' I did not
anticipate that. I guess I should have. That's why it's great to
play in New York. But writing off the whole season seems a little
extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets went out the next two games in Miami and drilled the
Marlins by a combined score of 18-3, causing  &UR; Orel Hershiser to
warn his teammates, ``Don't be too arrogant in your interviews.
It's only one game.'' &QL; 
Mo-mentum &QL; 
The hottest items selling in Orange County have  &UR; Mo Vaughn's name
stamped all over them. T-shirts with ``The Beginning of a New
Mo-llennium,'' are $23 for adults and $20 for kids. A baseball cap
that reads ``Mo-llennium'' runs for $20.
</P>
<P>
   ``The addition of Mo did wonders for us,'' said Angels vice
president of sales and marketing  &UR; Ron Minegar.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Angels made their splash by signing Vaughn
away from the Boston Red Sox, the club sent out pizza boxes to its
season ticket holders. On the top of the box was a smiling picture
of Vaughn. Above were the words, ``We Deliver.'' &QL; 
Lookin' out my back door &QL; 
Los Angeles' $105 million pitcher,  &UR; Kevin Brown, finally recovered
from his initial ``sticker shock'' of the Southern California
housing market and managed to purchase a quaint $3.8 million home
in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The 7,800-square-foot home, which sits on an acre, is described
as ``Country English.'' It belonged to  &UR; John Fogerty, the lead
singer for the 1960s and '70s band Credence Clearwater Revival. It
has seven bedrooms, a pool, a spa and views of the city.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Brown bought the lot next door for $1.5 million. He
is also building a new home on 60 acres in his year-round residence
of Macon, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Sticktoitivness &QL; 
Veteran  &UR; Mike Morgan pitched his way into the record books last
week when he entered a Texas Rangers game, giving him 11 different
clubs he has played for, the most of any athlete in any pro sport.
Morgan was tied with  &UR; Tommy Davis,  &UR; Bob L. Miller and  &UR; Ken Brett.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means somebody wants you, and that's not all bad,'' Morgan
said. ``It might be broken by a guy in this room (pointing to  &UR; Todd
Zeile, who is on his seventh club).''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, who made his big-league debut within weeks of graduating
high school in Las Vegas, has played for 22 different managers,
starting with  &UR; Bobby Winkles in Oakland in 1978 and leading all the
way to current Rangers Manager  &UR; Johnny Oates. Some other notable
managers include  &UR; Bobby Cox,  &UR; Cal Ripken Sr.,  &UR; Frank Robinson,
 &UR; Tony La Russa and
 &UR; Tom Kelly. &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL; 
The parade of loyalists is led by Baltimore's  &UR; Cal Ripken Jr., and
San Diego's  &UR; Tony Gwynn. Also on the list are Cincinnati's  &UR; Barry
Larkin, Atlanta's  &UR; Tom Glavine, Anaheim's  &UR; Chuck Finley, Seattle's
 &UR; Ken Griffey &UR; Jr. and  &UR; Edgar Martinez, Houston's  &UR; Craig Biggio and
the Cubs'  &UR; Mark
 &UR; Grace. &QL; 
THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; That's a lot of history they're fighting: The Chicago Cubs have not
had consecutive winning seasons since  &UR; Leo Durocher managed the
club to that feat in 1970-71. The last time the Cubs posted
back-to-back playoff clubs was 1907-08.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; It's a message, but what kind?: The name of Chicago White Sox
Manager  &UR; Jerry Manuel's pastor is  &UR; Frank Thomas. Honest. ``I was
like, `Dang, I finally met the real  &UR; Frank Thomas,' '' Manuel said.
We're not quite sure what he meant by ``the real'' Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Ron LeFlore.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Cincinnati Bearded Blonds?: Now that the Reds have relaxed
their long-standing facial hair policy, the club had 13 of its 25
opening day players sporting some form of hair on their faces. Six
of the players had colored their hair with peroxide.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The walking man: San Francisco outfielder  &UR; Barry
 &UR; Bonds made his way into the record book last week when he was
intentionally walked for the 290th time in his career, surpassing
 &UR; Hank
 &UR; Aaron for the National League record. With another four intentional
walks, Bonds will pass Aaron for the major league record. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL; 
 &UR; Juan Encarnacion, a leading candidate for AL Rookie of the Year,
slammed a leadoff home run for Detroit in the first inning of the
first game of the season. It was the first time a Detroit leadoff
hitter began a season with a home run since  &UR; Roy Johnson did it for
the 1932 Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Phillies entered the season with 8,260 losses
during the current century, easily the most among any professional
sports franchise, and equates to an average of more than 84 losses
per season. The Phillies' .458 winning percentage is the worst
among the original 16 major league clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The trade that sent reliever  &UR; Bobby Ayala, a Valley resident,
from Seattle to Montreal last week included the Mariners also
agreeing to pay $1.2 million of Ayala's $1.8 million salary.
</P>
<P>
   Short bites from Cubland include  &UR; Henry Rodriguez becoming the
first left fielder to start two straight opening days since  &UR; Brian
Dayett in 1986-'87 and  &UR; Mark Grace joining  &UR; Cap Anson as the only
Cub to start at the same position on opening day an entire decade.
Anson's decade was the 1880s.
</P>
<P>
   When second baseman  &UR; Carlos Feebles and outfielder
 &UR; Carlos Beltran were in Kansas City's opening day lineup, it marked
the first time since 1987 that two rookies were in the Royals'
first lineup of the season. The last time featured third baseman
 &UR; Kevin
 &UR; Seitzer and outfielder  &UR; Bo Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; James Baldwin, who was the Chicago White Sox opening day
starter, is now an incredible 10-0 when pitching in domed stadiums.
Baldwin was the winning pitcher in the White Sox opening day win at
Seattle's Kingdome. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL; 
Cleveland was hot and heavy to make a trade with Oakland for
starter  &UR; Kenny Rogers but has apparently cooled on the idea for now
because of Rogers' elbow pains during the spring. The Indians were
talking about sending  &UR; Richie Sexson and  &UR; Dwight Gooden to the
Athletics for Rogers, a deal that could be resurrected in the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle has targeted pitcher  &UR; Jamie Moyer as its first priority
among pitchers, leaving  &UR; Jeff Fassero's status up in the air for
now. Moyer and the team are close to agreeing to a three-year
extension.
</P>
<P>
   The agent for  &UR; David Wells and the Toronto Blue Jays have begun
negotiations to extend the pitcher's contract beyond this season.
Wells has an extension for 2000 but can be guaranteed a trade after
the season since he was traded in the midst of a long-term deal.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect Baltimore starter  &UR; Scott Kamienicki back anytime
soon. His pulled hamstring is still a concern, and the Orioles
aren't counting on the right-hander's return before the first week
of May at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mark Langston, who retired two weeks ago and is now pitching
minor league games for Cleveland, could very well be placed into
the Indians' pitching plans, probably in the bullpen initially,
before the month is out. &QL; 
The final word &QL; 
The Pittsburgh Pirates finally stuck the first shovel in the ground
where PNC Park, their new home starting in 2001, will be built.
This was a franchise on the brink of leaving Pittsburgh not long
ago, which would have been a sad day for all in baseball. The $228
million ballpark will come with a fabulous reminder to all since
the Sixth Street Bridge, which runs from downtown to where the park
will be located, was renamed last week Roberto Clemente Bridge. &QL; 
THE RANKINGS &QL; 
 &UR; TOP OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. BostonGreat start, but Nomar Garciaparra is ailing again. Not a
good sign.  &QL; 
2. N.Y. YankeesAlready, the Bronx Bombers are flexing their
muscles.  &QL; 
3. San FranciscoNever consider this club out of any game or
divisional race.  &QL; 
4. ClevelandNo reason why the Tribe shouldn't win their fifth
straight division title.  &QL; 
5. AtlantaTroubles ahead? This bullpen is awfully young and
inexperienced.  &QL; 
6. Los AngelesRaul Mondesi's heroics have the Dodgers riding high.
 &QL; 
7. N.Y. MetsHot out of the gate, which can only lead to higher
confidence.  &QL; 
8. Chicago CubsSammy Sosa's not even doing his thing yet.  &QL; 
9. TexasQuite an impressive series in Detroit, especially after
losing the first one. &UR; BOTTOM OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
30. Kansas CityIt goes to show that spring training means
absolutely nothing.  &QL; 
29. MinnesotaThe season's one week old, and it's already gotten
ugly in the Twin Cities.  &QL; 
28. OaklandHow many designated hitters can one club have?  &QL; 
27. CincinnatiToo bad starter Pete Harnisch can't pitch every day.
 &QL; 
26. ArizonaThe players' self-confidence is definitely shaken right
now.  &QL; 
25. San DiegoStarting the season in Mexico made no sense at all.  &QL; 
24. TorontoLost to Minnesota while scoring nine runs Thursday.  &QL; 
23. Tampa BayIn two opening days, Wilson Alvarez has given up 12
runs in 5 innings.  &QL; 
22. MontrealIt's so bad that for the first time in 31 years the
opener was not on TV. ON THE RISE &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Chicago White Sox: Yes, it's only the first week of the season, but
the White Sox went into the Kingdome and basically toyed with the
Seattle Mariners, a far more talented ballclub. Respected Manager
 &UR; Jerry Manuel is now in his second season, and maybe his eloquent
demeanor is filtering its way down to the players. This club is not
good enough to contend, however. It's a scrappy bunch that very
well could wind up having the better record in Chicago this
season. &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL; 
 &UR; Baltimore Orioles: The starting pitchers are giving up runs by the
truck load, and the offense did little the first week. This is a
club that will not respond well to losing, especially with Manager
 &UR; Ray
 &UR; Miller's status very much in question. A poor April would probably
cost Miller his job. &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL; 
Judging by this response, count Philadelphia outfielder  &UR; Ron &UR; Gant
among those who strongly disapprove of the idea Major League
Baseball is kicking around of putting small advertising patches on
big-league uniforms: ``Ads belong on billboards and walls, not
uniforms. To me, my uniform is sacred, and I'd like to keep it that
way.'' &QL; 
OUT OF LEFT FIELD &QL; 
This space is normally reserved for up-and-coming players, but this
week we will deviate and offer it to the New York Mets' 40-year-old
wonder,  &UR; Rickey Henderson. The 10-time All-Star blazed out of the
blocks, batting .545 in the Mets first three games. Henderson had
three doubles, two home runs, four RBIs, a stolen base and five
runs scored. He has been staving off challenges from younger
players for more than 10 years and continues to be a productive
player. &QL;

BATTING SLUMP IS OVER, IT'S MILLER'S TIME

   ATLANTA _ It was a picture of frustration, and it had  &UR; Damian
 &UR; Miller's face right smack dab in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Saturday night's game against the Atlanta Braves, the
catcher had struck out five times in as many at-bats and had one
measly walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I have ever struck out that many times in a row
before,'' Miller said. ``I'm wearing a path between the plate and
the dugout walking back.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller was able to get a bit more exercise Saturday night,
legging out a pair of doubles to right field and hitting a single
to emerge from his slump in Arizona's 8-3 victory, its first of the
season. The Diamondbacks amassed 16 hits.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kelly Stinnett continues to be hobbled by a bruised quadriceps
muscle suffered in Friday night's series opener.  &UR; Greg Colbrunn,
the third catcher, has been away from the team since midweek due to
the death of his grandmother. &QL; 
Wohlers a temptation &QL; 
Right-hander  &UR; Mark Wohlers a Diamondback?
</P>
<P>
   It's a remote possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The man who had 77 saves for the Atlanta Braves from 1995 to
1997, then ran into mechanical and personal problems, was
designated for assignment by the Braves on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He must first clear waivers, and if that occurs by Monday, he
could agree to go to the minor leagues or elect to become a free
agent. &QL; 
Chouinard in, Young out &QL; 
The Diamondbacks, wanting to add an 11th pitcher to the roster with
right-hander  &UR; Armando Reynoso joining the rotation, purchased the
contract of right-hander  &UR; Bobby Chouinard from Triple-A Tucson and
designated outfielder  &UR; Ernie Young for assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is out of options, Young will be placed on waivers
beginning Monday, and if he clears by Wednesday, the Diamondbacks
will re-sign him and send him to Tucson. &QL;

BATISTA FULL OF FIRE _ INSIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - The thing about Tony Batista is you can never tell
what type of day he's having simply by looking at his face.
</P>
<P>
   This is a player whose emotional speedometer never varies. Even
on a night when the Diamondbacks shortstop went 5 for 5 with a home
run and four RBIs, Batista refused to show much of anything.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to assume that Batista isn't giving his all. His
smooth and laid-back approach has often been interpreted as his
having little or no drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when I was coming up through the Oakland system,''
Batista recalled after the Diamondbacks' first victory of the
season Saturday night. ``I had players and coaches tell me my body
language made it seem like I didn't want to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the way I approach the game. I don't put pressure
on myself. I can't be in the bottom of the ninth inning thinking,
`Oh my, I have to make this play.' I get the ball easy and make my
throw. Different people take different approaches.''
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of different approaches, how about Batista's
batting stance? As a keen baseball observer once noted of Batista's
awkward batting stance, ``It's looks like he lost a bet or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Batista has taken grief from fans and even opponents, who have
openly mocked him, because of his wide-open stance. He stands with
both feet squarely facing the pitcher before he begins the
transition to a more traditional stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he hits the way he did tonight, I don't care if he stands
on his head,'' said Randy Johnson, who in some form, had to be the
pitcher to give the Diamondbacks their first victory. ``Who knows,
maybe he lulls the opposing pitcher to sleep with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Batista began using the exaggerated stance two years ago while
playing winter ball in his native Dominican Republic, where he is
considered the best current Dominican-born shortstop in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's weird,'' Batista said. ``But I see the ball better
with both eyes facing the pitcher. I can pick up what kind of pitch
is coming easier. It's almost like I am a fan sitting in the
stands, being able to see the pitch with both eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   As is the overwhelming feeling within the Diamondbacks
organization: If it works, who cares what it looks like.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't mean Batista doesn't hear it from the fans. In
Los Angeles last week, several fans were all over him, yelling that
he would never hit with that stance.
</P>
<P>
   After swatting 18 home runs last season in fewer than 300
at-bats, the Diamondbacks were convinced that Batista had at least
earned the right to open the season as the every day shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Buck Showalter never came out and said that, wanting to
see how Batista would react to competition with rookie Danny
Klassen, who eventually was sent to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   But Batista reacted the same way he always has. This is a player
who was signed to a $2,000 bonus at 17 in 1991. Considered little
more than a live body in the Athletics chain during his first three
years, Batista finally caught the attention of the front office
after his 17-home run season at Class A Modesto in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He followed that with 16 home runs at Double A the next season
and made his major league debut in the middle of the 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``With God's help, I have been able to make myself a major
league player,'' he said. ``All those times that nobody considered
me anything, I used that as motivation. I wanted to demonstrate
that I could play. Thankfully, somebody noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Batista, who has seven consecutive hits, certainly grabbed
Atlanta starter Tom Glavine's attention in the fourth inning when
he rocketed a line drive into the left field seats and continued
ripping line drives the rest of the night.
</P>
<P>
   He easily can be overlooked on this club. But if the
Diamondbacks are to contend for the National League West title,
which they plan to do, then their shortstop must play a big role.
</P>
<P>
   Batista said he's ready for the challenge, which is simply the
latest in a line of them. &QL;

A BEANBALL WILL SURELY FLY, BUT WHY SHOULD IT?

<P>
   Once, I tried out for a baseball team. Near the end of a
gymnasium cattle call, I stepped into a long, rectangular net. My
turn to go deep.
</P>
<P>
   Two upperclassmen were standing over the pitching machine,
feeding a wicked contraption with wheels spinning furiously. One of
them smirked as he showed me the ball. Then . . .
</P>
<P>
   THWAAAACK.
</P>
<P>
   It should've been the sound of crushed cowhide. Except my bat
was gone, rolling on the floor. And so was I, giving birth to a
bruise that would strangely resemble the state of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   I learned then what I know now: Beanballs are for sissies.
</P>
<P>
   And so, under an ominous backdrop, the Diamondbacks return home
tomorrow, opening their season at Bank One Ballpark. The Dodgers
will be in town, and six games into the season, there is already an
unspoken bounty waiting to be claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Todd Stottlemyre pitches today and will miss the
series. But someone else on the Diamondbacks will be expected to
lose control of a fastball, one that somehow finds Dodgers flesh.
If not, the home team will be labeled for its lack of spine, and
the scouting report will spread to every clubhouse in the National
League.
</P>
<P>
   Every sport has its rituals, things that go unquestioned because
they've always happened in the past, and therefore, mistakenly
placed into the fabric of competition. Somehow, the beanball has
fallen into the category of necessary evil.
</P>
<P>
   The logic is baffling. The best hitters in the game fail seven
of every 10 at-bats. But if they succeed, as Matt Williams did with
a home run in Los Angeles followed by a long foul ball in his next
appearance, a pitcher is suddenly privileged to commit a cowardly
act of revenge. In this case, it was Dodger hurler Chan Ho Park who
felt compelled to send Williams sprawling.
</P>
<P>
   And now the Diamondbacks are forced to retaliate? Risk losing a
starting pitcher and possibly another game for their own pound of
flesh? Please.
</P>
<P>
   There is a strong need for reform. To eliminate a barbaric act
that has no place in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it will never happen under a clueless commissioner.
And here's all you need to know about Bud Selig. Upon returning
from a controversial trip to Cuba, Selig was interviewed by ``Miami
Herald'' columnist Dan LeBatard. Selig is Jewish, and was asked how
he would feel if a major league baseball team went to Germany and
he saw the commissioner sitting next to Adolph Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, um,'' Selig replied, followed by a 10-second pause.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good bet that Selig has no idea of the impending chaos at
BOB.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was particularly incensed over the incident because his
home run trot is steeped in embarrassment, a man who runs the bases
with his head down. In truth, humility shouldn't mean squat.
</P>
<P>
   It is a pitcher's right to throw inside, to back hitters off the
plate. But no one should have the license to throw a
90-mile-per-hour fastball at someone's cranium just because he's
insulted. Just because he failed.
</P>
<P>
   That is a weapon for the weak, and any pitcher who indulges in
such malice should be ejected on the spot, placed on probation,
subjected to a heavy fine.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the burden is placed on the victim.
</P>
<P>
   The same applies to Stottlemyre, who blew a gasket during spring
training after Sammy Sosa crossed home plate and bowed to the fans.
Because of the ensuing retaliation, the game turned vicious, and
the Cubs' June journey to BOB is already circled on the calendar.
</P>
<P>
   After that game, Sosa vowed to quit styling on the field. Not
because Stottlemyre was offended. Rather, because one of his
teammates, Mark Grace, openly feared a steady diet of
hit-by-pitches, the result of Sosa's crowd-pleasing antics.
</P>
<P>
   Memo to pitchers everywhere: If you don't like it, get the guy
out.
</P>
<P>
   In football, there is a natural deterrent, and any cheap shot
can be dealt with legally on the ensuing play. In basketball,
unless you're Dennis Rodman, no one is undercutting an opponent
just because he drained a three-pointer. In hockey, fighting is
allowed because it's the final line of accountability.
</P>
<P>
   But baseball players don't want to fight. They want to run on
the field with 20 of their closest friends and act tough. And when
it's all over, they want one of their pitchers to even the score.
</P>
<P>
   Stop already. Before someone loses his career, and maybe his
life. &QL;

DUVAL, WOODS CLING TO HOPES OF COMEBACK VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ When the final 18 holes are played out today in
the 63rd Masters, don't look past the 1-2 punch that was favored to
win this tournament.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; David Duval and  &UR; Tiger Woods, the Nos. 1 and 2 players, are
lurking, and are very much in it. OK, Woods is 5 shots back and
Duval is 6, but with the course playing harder than in past years
after a redesign and added rough, and with the nature of the beast
called Augusta National, anything is possible if you're just close.
</P>
<P>
   Look how much ground  &UR; Steve Pate made up during Saturday's third
round with a 7-under 65. Spain's  &UR; Jose Maria Olazabal might be at 7
under but . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``As you now, it's not easy to go low on this course when you're
near the lead,'' said Woods, who finally got off the 72s with a 70
in the third round that featured two birdies on the back side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in good shape. Really good shape. Anybody 4 or 5 under
after nine holes is in the ballgame. Anything can happen on that
back nine.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval, who is going for his third straight victory, was
perplexed after also shooting 70. Along the way, he birdied his way
through Amen Corner (Nos. 11-13).
</P>
<P>
   ``How far back am I?'' Duval asked as he walked off the course,
his tunnel vision causing him to be oblivious to what was going on
around him. ``That's a little bit of a reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you just never know what's going to happen here. I was
just happy to get back in it a little bit on the back (side). I
might still have a chance.'' &QL; 
Arizona connection &QL; 
 &UR; Phil Mickelson said Augusta National is playing ``the fairest I've
ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really surprised that no one has gone 10 or 12 under,''
said the Scottsdale pro, who is 2 under after a 71 on Saturday.
``The golf course is very susceptible to a low score.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson even predicted that someone would come from 2 or 3
back on the back nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many different kinds of shots you have to play
out there at the end,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson had one of those at No. 15, where he made an
incredible recovery from the trees on the right side to make par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no shot,'' he said. ``So I hit a 3-iron under, between,
around and over these branches to just right of the bunker. And
that wasn't even one of the more difficult ones I've had out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's other four entrants,  &UR; Brandel Chamblee (1 over, 75),
 &UR; Tom
 &UR; Lehman (2 over, 73),  &UR; Tim Herron (2 over, 74) and  &UR; Andrew Magee (3
over, 72) are probably too far back.
</P>
<P>
   Of that group, Magee did have one of the big moments of the day,
holing out a sand wedge from 115 yards at the troublesome 15th
hole. It marked the first eagle of the week on the redesigned
hole. &QL; 
The payout &QL; 
The official purse was announced at $4 million on Saturday, with
$720,000 going to the winner along with a $200 green jacket.
</P>
<P>
   The payout places the season's first major championship above
regular PGA Tour events, but below the Tour Championship, Players
Championship and the three World Golf Championship events, which
are worth $5 million. &QL;

PATE SETS MASTERS RECORD  
 MISHAP MAGNET HITS 7 BIRDIES IN A ROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ After going through a series of accidents that
would make even the most careless guy look over his shoulder,
temperamental Steve Pate has become a ``dormant volcano.'' At least
that's what his caddie, Allan Mellan, calls ``Pater.''
</P>
<P>
   But the volcano erupted on Saturday at The Masters, and this
time he let his clubs do the talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no explanation for what happened,'' said Pate, who
somehow strung together seven consecutive birdies at Augusta
National beginning at the seventh hole.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he walked off the 13th green, the record for birdies
in a row at The Masters firmly in his hand, playing partner Lee
Westwood was fanning him with a towel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just kind of laughing,'' said Pate, whose 7-under 65 is
the best round of this tournament so far, moving him to 5 under and
within 2 shots of the lead going into today's final round.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't much to be said after I made those two putts in a
row on (Nos.) 10 and 11 _ a 45-footer backed up by a 30-footer.
Things were going well.''
</P>
<P>
   A routine par at the 14th finally cooled him off, but not before
he usurped three other players from the past who had holed six in a
row _ Johnny Miller in 1975 beginning at No. 2; Ahwatukee's Mark
Calcavecchia in '92 starting at No. 13; and David Toms in '98
beginning at No. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Pate birdied his way through famed Amen Corner,
which includes the 11th, 12th and 13th holes.
</P>
<P>
   As the run grew, so did his gallery with ``people coming out of
the woods like Big Foot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that was kind of cool,'' Pate said, his best shot being a
7-iron to 1 foot at the 12th.
</P>
<P>
   Pate is an amazing story. He almost ended his career three years
ago with a series of accidents.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he drove his car into a truck at 75 miles an hour,
breaking his hand and wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have come out a lot worse,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he was riding his bike in the family driveway and got
hit by a deer that his dog was chasing, but he escaped with minor
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Later that summer, he tripped on the dock at Lake Powell during
a family vacation and broke the other wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've settled down a little,'' Pate said. ``I wouldn't say (my
temper) has disappeared, but after (the accidents), a bad shot
doesn't seem like such a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Pate hit only one of those in Round 3, which led to a bogey at
the 17th.
</P>
<P>
   But he said his birdie binge was really no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I play is usually to par the course to death and
somewhere during the week have one or two stretches where I make
seven birdies in 10 holes,'' said the 37-year-old Californian who
has won six times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first 36 holes, I played well and didn't get anything out
of it. Then boom. I've done this before, but seven is about my
limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Pate's run was the longest on the PGA Tour this season. Steve
Elkington made six in a row at the Doral Open, a tournament he won.

FLESHMAN RUNS A NATIONAL BEST AT ARCADIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KIRBY LEE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Lauren Fleshman conquered a cold and a stellar
field in the girls' 3,200 meters in the Arcadia Invitational on
Saturday night at Arcadia High.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Clarita, Calif., Canyon High senior ran 10 minutes,
21.36 seconds, the fastest time in the nation this season, an
improvement of nearly 17 seconds off her career-best 10:38.13 run
as a sophomore. In addition, Fleshman moved into eighth on the
area's all-time list. Not bad for somebody not feeling exactly 100
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of phlegm,'' Fleshman said. ``I had enough phlegm to
rehydrate the entire field of girls out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford-bound Fleshman had more than enough to run away
from one of the nation's strongest fields, clocking 68.0 seconds
over the final 400. She won comfortably over a field which included
Catherine Guiney of New Jersey, the national scholastic indoor
champion, and Indiana's Michelle De La Vina, the freshman national
indoor record-holder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there is more there,'' said Fleshman, who has run only
one interval workout on the track this year. ``I am sick, but I
can't wait to get back out there on the track. I am really ready to
run fast. Things can only get better from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleshman passed through the mile among a lead pack of four in
5:12.8 but took the lead with two laps to go after the pace
dwindled to 81 and 83 seconds over the next 800. Canyon coach Dave
DeLong instructed Fleshman to take the lead and she was never
challenged the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really talk about time,'' DeLong said. ``We talk
about racing. I say, `You're here to win. You're here to race as
fast as you can. Do not blow this opportunity to get something
special done. Take a risk and go for it.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a breakthrough night for Glendale Hoover sophomore
Anita Siraki, who chopped 25 seconds off her lifetime best in
placing second in 10:30.81. The mark moved her into 10th on the
region list. Siraki moved into second after Fleshman's break and
maintained it to the finish. Katie Brizgys of Palo Alto and Liana
Tuson of Australia finished third and fourth, respectively, in
10:35.44 and 10:35.74.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pace was fast at the beginning,'' Siraki said. ``And I was
a little intimidated with everybody up there. I just wanted to keep
my position when I was second and stay there.''
</P>
<P>
   Simi Valley Royal junior Oliver Jackson reaffirmed his position
as the state's top long jumper. The junior sailed 24 feet, 3 inches
to improve on his nation-leading best of 24-1 and a five-inch
victory over Sacramento El Camino's Robert Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   In the boys' pole vault, Troy Becker of Malibu finished second
at 15-6 and Shane Hackeett of Los Angeles Verdugo Hills tied for
seventh at 14-6. Tim Adrian of Moorpark, who has signed a letter of
intent with Syracuse, placed eighth in the boys' discus at 178-10.
</P>
<P>
   Annmarie Turpin of Simi Valley and Bridget Pearson of Glendale
Hoover registered runner-up performances in the girls' high jump
and pole vault, respectively. Turpin equaled her state-leading mark
of 5-8 but finished second on misses. Pearson, the 1997 state
champion, cleared 11-6.
</P>
<P>
   It was a hectic day for Turpin, who also competed in the long
jump, 400 and 300 hurdles during the open session earlier in the
day. Turpin cleared both 5-6 and 5-8 on her third attempt before
taking three attempts at 5-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what you can do with fresh legs, but I like to
do an event or two before I high jump to get warmed up,'' Turpin
said. ``I am used to doing that in league meets so I did not feel
too tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Deneeka Torrey of L.A. Taft, who won the 100, 100-meter hurdles
and 300-meter low hurdles in a Northwest Valley Conference meet
against L.A. Birmingham on Friday, was fourth in the 100 hurdles in
14.58 and third in the 300 low hurdles in 44.35 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Rhodes of L.A. Loyola finished second in the boys'
seeded 110-meter high hurdles in 14.53 and fifth in the
invitational 300-meter intermediate hurdles in 38.64. L.A. Notre
Dame's Sierra Hauser-Price was a winner in the girls' seeded 100 in
12.22 and second in the seeded 200 in 24.87. &UR; !dlim!!end! &LR;  &QL;

LONGLEY: MALONE TRIED TO INJURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX -  &UR; Luc Longley has seen the video now, and he's
convinced: The Suns center believes Utah forward  &UR; Karl Malone was
out to hurt him Friday night when Malone crashed into Longley,
hyperextending Longley's left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Dr.  &UR; Richard Emerson, the Suns' orthopedic surgeon, examined
X-rays and a magnetic resonance imaging test and said Longley has a
bone bruise and capsular sprain, but there is no ligament damage.
</P>
<P>
   For that, Longley said he's lucky.
</P>
<P>
   But still mad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked pretty bloody flagrant to me,'' Longley said after
viewing a tape. ``There's a fine line between trying to draw a foul
and going straight for someone's leg. It looked like he went for my
knee, and that's piss-weak, as far as I'm concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (term) is probably Australian.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter, the message was clear enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like the knee was damaged,'' he said. ``I think I'm
lucky. It was pretty sore, but I knew when I got up (Saturday) I
wasn't in too much trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just amazed that someone would do that. He had a smile on
his face when he was going back down the court. I looked at that on
the video and I was amazed. We all make our living with our
bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   And Longley suggested maybe Malone might be trying to settle a
score. Malone and the Jazz lost in the last two NBA Finals to
Longley's former team, the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize the last two years haven't been great for him, as
far as playing against the Bulls,'' he said. ``But I don't know why
he would do that, especially for a guy who projects himself as
being a class act.''
</P>
<P>
   Longley is expected to be out for at least a week with the
injury. He will not make the club's trip to San Antonio and Seattle
Monday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Suns Coach  &UR; Danny Ainge said the Suns probably won't try to sign
a big man to a 10-day contract for a couple of reasons. One, there
aren't any big men available that would be likely to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``And by the time we brought somebody in, and they learned what
we're doing, Luc will probably be back,'' Ainge said.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge said he didn't think Malone was trying to hurt Longley.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always lowering his shoulder and bulling into people,''
Ainge said. ``But I didn't think he was trying to intentionally
hurt Luc.'' &QL;

KONRAD'S THE FULL PACKAGE 
</HEADLINE>
 DRAFT-KONRAD-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ As someone who has lived in North Andover
since he was 8 years old, Rob Konrad, not surprisingly, has a
preference as to which NFL team he'd most like to be drafted by
next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take a lot of pride in being from Massachusetts, and my
dream is to play for the Patriots,'' said Konrad, the Syracuse
fullback who this weekend was scheduled to visit St. Louis
following his stop in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Konrad visited with the Patriots two weeks ago, one of several
stops on a hectic tour around the country. Teams such as the
Patriots, Cowboys, Dolphins, Falcons, and Rams are truly intrigued
by the tremendous athleticism in a back who is 6 feet 3 inches and
255 pounds. He runs a 4.53 40-yard dash and is considered a
physical specimen.
</P>
<P>
   Teams are intrigued because they see Konrad as more than just a
fullback. He can run with the ball, catch it, and block, though
he's not considered the smash-mouth blocker Sam Gash is. There is
more finesse and skill to his game, which fascinates some teams and
scares others.
</P>
<P>
   Some draft gurus have Konrad going late in the first round to
Minnesota or late in the second round to New England. He probably
won't have to settle for third-round money, for he is the top-rated
fullback in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   In visits with coaches such as Dan Reeves, Jimmy Johnson, Pete
Carroll, Dick Vermeil, and Chan Gailey, he often finds himself
answering the same questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hear a lot is, `Can you line up and carry it 25 times a
game?' I answer it, `Sure, I could.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was given the chance to do that, I could, but with our
offense, I wasn't called on to do that. If I had gone to Wisconsin,
I would have carried it 25-35 times a game and people wouldn't be
asking me that question. I know one thing: The fact they're asking
means they think I can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some think he can be a feature back, and almost everyone agrees
he could be a versatile player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any team that drafts me is going to use me as more
than just a fullback,'' said Konrad. ``I'll be used a little as the
lone back, and I'll probably be used as a second tight end and an
H-back. I don't envision being a guy who carries the ball 25 times
a game, but you never know. I think the guy I'm closest to in the
NFL is a Mike Alstott at Tampa Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   Which should be enough to get him drafted no later than the
second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a pride point of view, I'd like to think I'm one of the
top 30 players in the draft, but I understand how it works,'' said
Konrad. ``The last fullback drafted in the first round was Tommy
Vardell by the 49ers in 1992, and he didn't have a real long
career. Drafting a fullback in the first round just isn't done in
the NFL. Hopefully, a team will look at me a little differently and
picture me being an all-purpose type of player in their offense.''
</P>
<P>
   While visiting the Cowboys' Valley Ranch complex Thursday,
Konrad hooked up with Darryl ``Moose'' Johnston, another former
Syracuse fullback of note. He also met Deion Sanders, whom he
compared to the Patriots' Tebucky Jones _ a former teammate with
the Orangemen _ in terms of athleticism. Some say it was Konrad who
forced Jones to defense because it was when Konrad came along that
Syracuse moved Jones out of the running back spot to safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't too many people as athletically gifted as `Buck,'
'' said Konrad. ``He's Deion Sanders-like. He's that type of
athlete. I really didn't beat him out for a job, he was just one of
those special players who was able to fill another need on the
team. Now he's playing corner, and if people are patient with him,
he'll do a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Konrad was a star tailback/linebacker at St. John's Prep in
Danvers. He was big and fast and there were few high school
defenses that could stop him. He also was a promising baseball
player who drew the attention of some pro scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people thought I was a better baseball player than a
football player, but I just didn't love it,'' said Konrad. ``I
wanted to play football.''
</P>
<P>
   He was highly recruited throughout the country and had his pick
of the top football programs, including Notre Dame and Florida
State. There also was a possibility that he would stay home and
play for Boston College, but Konrad broke hearts at the Heights and
chose Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation there just wasn't right,'' said Konrad. ``If Tom
Coughlin had stayed, I probably would have gone there, but Dan
Henning took over and some of the things they were doing with the
offense there didn't seem to suit my game. Syracuse seemed like the
right place for me, and I've never regretted that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   As a recruiting inducement, the Orangemen offered Konrad the
seldom-used and storied No. 44, which had been worn by Jim Brown,
Ernie Davis, and Floyd Little. The number is huge in Syracuse lore,
so huge that there's a bar near campus called ``44s'' and the
Syracuse ZIP code also ends with 44.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a number that I asked for,'' said Konrad, who even
has a phone number with 44. ``At the time, I didn't even know the
story behind the number. I came to realize that it was a
significant thing, and in my years at Syracuse, I got to meet and
sit down with both Jim Brown and Floyd Little and talked to them
about football. That meant a lot to me and they are conversations
I'll never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Konrad may not live up to the deeds of Brown, Davis, and Little,
but he is used much differently than they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my junior year, I got a taste of being the primary
runner,'' said Konrad, ``and while I was in there I was averaging
about 7 yards per carry and things were going really well for me. I
was being considered as a finalist for the Doak Walker Award, but
then I got hurt. It was very disappointing, but I think it built
character and it helped me get through adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Konrad suffered a severe hamstring injury as a junior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hamstring was torn off the bone on my leg,'' he said.
``But it was clean and they were able to pull it off the bone and
screw it back in.''
</P>
<P>
   That is an issue that comes up during his NFL visits, but he
feels he has quelled any concerns about his physical status.
</P>
<P>
   Konrad was injured in each of his seasons at Syracuse, leading
some to wonder whether he was like a skilled boxer with a glass
jaw. As a sophomore, he broke his hand. As a junior, he had the
hamstring and knee problem, along with cracked ribs. Last season he
sprained his knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's been an issue with the teams I've
interviewed with,'' said Konrad. ``I think they know that all the
injuries had nothing to do with a lack of conditioning or anything
like that. They were fluke things that could have happened to
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how much talent Konrad actually has may be unknown because
the injuries always seemed to set him back when he was on the verge
of really wowing the country. Many described him as the key to the
high-powered Syracuse offense directed by Donovan McNabb. Konrad,
when healthy, seemed to give McNabb incredible options.
</P>
<P>
   Konrad carried the ball 295 times in his career for 1,516 yards,
a 5.1-yard average, with 20 rushing touchdowns. He also made 41
catches for 473 yards and three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catching the ball is a second-nature thing to me,'' said
Konrad. ``It's just something I do and that I have to do at the
position I play. It's definitely something I can help an NFL team
with.''
</P>
<P>
   The modern NFL fullback is used almost exclusively for blocking,
but Konrad could very well be a throwback to a John Riggins type,
i.e. the featured runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've been prepared for the NFL with our program at
Syracuse,'' said Konrad. ``I think there are some unique things I
can offer. It's just a waiting game right now, just like it is for
everyone else. I'm going to enjoy it because it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially if he's a Patriot.

WALTON'S COMMENTS HEARTFELT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The great thing about Bill Walton is that he's Bill
Walton.
</P>
<P>
   He says things that are easily questioned, but it doesn't
matter.
</P>
<P>
   He's been there, and done it, several times, and the one thing
that he believes and says again and again is irrefutable: NBA
championships are about the team. It's all about the chemistry, the
attitude, and, of course, the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Walton knows about ``team.'' John Wooden, one of the greatest
college coaches ever, once called Walton ``as fine a team player as
you'll ever see. He knows there's more to the game than scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton loved his teams at UCLA. Loved the championship team in
Portland. He especially loves the Boston championship team he
played on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I owe so much to the Celtics,'' Walton said. ``They gave me my
life back. I want to see them back on top.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is not going to happen soon, according to Walton, who
is now an NBC commentator. The present Celtics just don't have it.
No chemistry. No attitude. No heart.
</P>
<P>
   They have coach Rick Pitino, but even he might not be able to
get it done in time to satisfy his own impatience, much less
diehard Celtics fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitino is trying to establish his authority on the team,''
said Walton, who is a Pitino fan. ``There has to be one guy at the
top, and if the coach loses his authority, the team faces very
dangerous times. It's critical that the team buys into the coach's
philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   What if Pitino's philosophy doesn't work?
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to make sense or the team won't buy it,'' Walton said.
``The key players have to be in unison. If it's ever going to work,
the players must acquiesce to what the coach says.''
</P>
<P>
   Can a pressing defense work in the NBA? Walton couldn't say. He
argued that players make the team, not the style or defensive
schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Well, do the Celtics have the players to execute Pitino's
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Walton said. ``I was shocked when they signed Kenny
Anderson. Pitino needs physical athletes. Playing defense and being
physical is not what Anderson does.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't even ask about what Walton considers to be the key to
winning championships: rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Celtics have no chance of competing on the boards,''
Walton said. ``Put it this way. Neither (Vitaly) Potapenko or Tony
Battie will replace Robert Parish or Kevin McHale on the all-time
50 greatest list.''
</P>
<P>
   What about Antoine Walker?
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a chance to be a big-time player,'' Walton said. ``But
so much of success involves character and personal values. That's
where it all starts. It was the foundation that (Michael) Jordan
used to get to the top. You can't just sit there and take wild
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pitino is in charge of personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the greatest assumptions that people make is that there
is an endless list of quality players out there,'' Walton said.
``There isn't. Boston is committed to assembling its championship
through the draft. Unlike the Knicks or the Lakers, the Celtics
appear reluctant to enter the free agency market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of the Celtics is filled with genius drafts _
(Bill) Russell, (Dave) Cowens, and (Larry) Bird, the anchors of the
three Celtics dynasties. We're talking three of the top 15 players
to ever play the game. They have nine most valuable players among
them. Ask yourself this: Is there anyone on the Celtics right now
on the verge of being a league MVP?''
</P>
<P>
   Walton is right about that, and he puts so-called marquee
players in context.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talent alone is not the sole answer,'' he said. ``Sure it's a
lot easier with talented players. But you can't tell me that Cowens
had more talent than Kareem (Abdul-Jabbar) or Elvin Hayes or Willis
Reed. But yet he was still able to win championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowens. Bird. Russell.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all had heart,'' Walton said.
</P>
<P>
   Especially Russell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the greatest winner in the history of sports,'' Walton
said. ``What's interesting about Russell is that he was considered
a project in high school. He never scored double figures. The
college scouts came to McClymonds High to see Paul Silas. Russell
was just a role player.''
</P>
<P>
   While working games on NBC, Walton often collides with his
colleague, Steve Jones, disagreeing on many subjects. But it's
never less than civil. Just two old-school guys, talking about
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Walton understands the frustration of Celtics fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston is such a special place,'' Walton said. ``More than any
other place, Boston loves basketball. They have seen the best and
you can't fool them. They have a knowledge and appreciation for the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA playoffs are about three weeks away. There's no telling
how soon it will be before the Celtics are ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry Bird was happy only three times in his life,'' Walton
said. ``Each time he had a championship trophy in his hand. If
Larry wins another one as a coach, he will be happy again. But only
for a little while. Then he will want another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah yes, matters of the heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no substitute for it on a team,'' Walton said. ``That
is what Pitino is searching for. Players with heart.''

CLAIBORNE TALENTED ENOUGH TO BE INSIDE OR OUTSIDE 
</HEADLINE>
 DRAFT-LINEBACKERS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Maybe Chris Claiborne's workouts haven't
been top-shelf this spring, but who cares? There is a reason
Claiborne wore the honored No. 55 at Southern Cal, just as there's
a reason he'll likely be the first linebacker selected in
Saturday's draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got inside toughness and outside speed,'' said a West
Coast scout. ``He could play either position in the NFL, but with
that quickness, he's going to be intriguing on the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne's 6-foot-2 1/2-inch, 248-pound frame makes him big
enough to shake off blockers and his 4.6-4.7 speed in the 40
enables him to chase down the fastest running backs.
</P>
<P>
   There are always exceptionally talented players that scouts say
lack motivation or are inconsistent performers. But would anyone
dare pass him up based on that? He'll likely be there for the
taking at No. 4 for the Indianapolis Colts, who desperately need
help on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Right behind Claiborne as a strong inside guy is Ohio State's
linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer. At 6-2 1/2, 258, he is a ferocious
hitter and a high-energy player. Some scouts believe he never
achieved his full potential in college and may be overrated, but he
plays the game hard and on adrenaline.
</P>
<P>
   Jevon Kearse was technically a defensive end at Florida, but
he'll likely play linebacker or an elephant spot in the NFL. He is
6-5 but only 262 pounds, which could mean trouble against 300-pound
linemen. He could gain weight and become a pure end, but regardless
he will be a good pass rusher with quick feet and long arms.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia's Gary Stills, Clemson's Rahim Abdullah, and
Florida's Mike Peterson are highly rated outside linebackers.
Peterson could be a terrific replacement for Todd Collins on the
weak side if the Patriots are looking for that type of linebacker.
Stills, 24, rushes the passer well and is one of the best blitzing
linebackers in the draft. Abdullah is just plain big; at 6-5, 245,
he gobbles up smaller running backs.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's Al Wilson may be the best inside guy after Claiborne
and Katzenmoyer. He is only 6 feet but his 239-pound frame is a
killer.
</P>
<P>
   Fall River's Marc Megna, at 6-1, 250, is too small to play nose
tackle as he did at Richmond and is projected as an inside
linebacker and a middle-to-late rounder. UMass linebacker Khari
Samuel, at 6-2 1/2, 242, also may be taken in the late rounds.

CARTER CAUGHT IN STICKUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fortunately for Anson Carter, National Hockey League
justice is not retroactive.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the sheepish grin he wore in the Bruins' dressing
room Saturday after their 3-2 win over the Tampa Bay Lightning at
the FleetCenter would have been a frown of remorse. And the winning
goal he scored at 7:43 of the third period would have gone the way
of the stick he used to score it _ into infamy.
</P>
<P>
   Just under five minutes after depositing a Joe Thornton feed
into the right side of the Lightning net, increasing his
career-high goal total to 22, Carter was in the penalty box. His
felony: a stick blade that exceeded the NHL limit of 3 inches in
width.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd measured it before without the tape and it was fine, but
the tape must have pushed it over,'' said Boston's quicksilver
forward. ``I'm going to make sure I'm real careful about it the
last couple of games and in the playoffs. I don't want to cost the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't cost the team Saturday because the Bruins' penalty
killers, statistically the best in the business, lived up to their
reputation by holding the Lightning without a shot on the power
play, though Pavel Kubina did ring one off the left post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to put the guys in that position,'' said Carter.
``But I have faith in our penalty killers.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter was put in a potentialy embarrassing position because
Lightning coach Jacques Demers tried to replicate the ploy he used
to help the Montreal Canadiens win the 1993 Stanley Cup. Back then,
with his team having lost the opener of the finals against Los
Angeles, Demers challenged the stick of the Kings' Marty McSorley.
It was found to be illegal, Montreal cashed in on the power play,
and the Canadiens were never headed again in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday the stakes were a tad lower: This was a garbage-time
special between one team locked into the playoffs and another
residing in oblivion. Nevertheless, Demers was willing to try every
strategic wrinkle to give woeful Tampa a sweep of this
home-and-home series. But he may have outfoxed himself.
</P>
<P>
   During the third period, while watching the action from the
bench, Tampa wingers Mike Sillinger and Rob Zamuner took special
note of Carter's blade.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was skating by and we said, `Holy cow, look at that,' ''
said Sillinger. ``We told the coach, but it's up to him what to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Demers decided to save that intelligence until it could best
serve the Lightning, and by then, Carter already had done his
damage, snapping the 2-2 tie. Trying to recoup at 12:40, with
Boston's Cameron Mann already in the penalty box for hooking,
Demers decided it was time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to try to get the power play at the right time,''
said Demers. ``We're trying to teach our young guys to play by the
rules, and this was an example.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it wasn't purely educational.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a five-on-four,'' said Sillinger, ``so he figured it
was a good time to call for the measurement, try to get a
five-on-three.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem. Tampa's Darcy Tucker had been called for
high-sticking at 12:40, just before Demers called for the
measurement. So although referee Kerry Fraser's metal gauge found
the stick to be illegal, it didn't give the Lightning a two-man
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jacques still thought he was in the 1993 Stanley Cup finals,''
said Bruins coach Pat Burns. ``The only thing was he forgot about
the coincidental minors, so it stayed a five-on-four instead of a
five-on-three.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who stands to be assessed a kangaroo court-type fine by
Burns, also wondered whether Demers's effort was worth the bother.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't expect something like that to happen, especially at
this time of the year with them out of the race,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Demers may have done him a favor in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned my lesson,'' said the Bruins' chastened hero, now
fully aware that crime won't always pay.

RADATZ RAN OUT OF GAS IN 1964 
</HEADLINE>
 GAME-RADATZ-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Dick Radatz was so close to being named Most Valuable
Player of the 1964 All-Star Game that he was already imaging what
it would be like to slip behind the wheel of the Corvette that the
game's MVP received.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then that son of a gun backed it right out of my garage,''
said the former Red Sox fireballer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That son of a gun'' was Philadelphia Phillies outfielder
Johnny Callison, who took Radatz deep for a three-run home run in
the bottom of the ninth to give the National League a stunning 7-4
win over the American Leaguers, who did not take kindly to losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My locker was in between (Mickey) Mantle and (Rocky) Colavito,
and there must have been 30 reporters around me after the game,''
Radatz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reporters asked, `What did he hit, Dick?' Mantle
turned around and said, `One of the damnedest home runs you've ever
seen.' And he wasn't laughing, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Radatz, known as the Monster for his imposing size and
terrifying fastball, was an All-Star in both 1963 and '64, when he
reigned as the AL's best closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I struck out 10 guys in 4 2/3 innings in those games,
and all I have to show for it is an 0-1 record and a 7-plus ERA,''
Radatz said.
</P>
<P>
   Radatz struck out five NL Stars in 1963, including future Hall
of Famers Willie Mays, Willie McCovey, and Duke Snider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate him,'' Pirates shortstop Dick Groat, a former NL MVP
and Radatz strikeout victim, told the Globe's Harold Kaese after
that game. ``I hate all big guys who throw the ball with such
little effort.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 7, 1964, the game was played in a brand-new ballpark,
Shea Stadium, located next to the site of that year's World's Fair.
The NL took an early 3-1 lead on home runs by Billy Williams and
Ken Boyer off Johnny Wyatt, who pitched for the Kansas City
Athletics at the time but later would be a star reliever for the
1967 Sox Impossible Dreamers.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time Radatz took the mound in the seventh, the AL had
taken a 4-3 lead. Future Hall of Famer Brooks Robinson hit a
two-run triple to tie the score, and Jim Fregosi's sacrifice fly
scored Elston Howard with the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   Radatz held the lead through the eighth, but in the ninth he
walked Mays, still a beloved figure in New York six years after the
Giants had left the Polo Grounds for San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had Willie struck out,'' Radatz said 35 years later. ``The
umpire was Ed Sudol, and on a 2-and-2 pitch Willie took one step
toward the dugout. Sudol called it a ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Mays walked, I never heard such a roar. I stepped off the
mound, it was so exciting. It was so loud, you could feel the
ground shake. I may have gotten caught up in it a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Mays then stole second, racheting up the noise level, and
Orlando Cepeda followed with a bloop single to right on which Joe
Pepitone threw past catcher Howard for an error, allowing Cepeda to
score.
</P>
<P>
   Radatz induced Boyer to pop up for the first out, then
intentionally walked Johnny Edwards. Ron Hunt was the scheduled
hitter, but instead Radatz saw a pinch hitter: Henry Aaron, who 10
years later would become the all-time home run king. Howard came to
the mound to talk with Radatz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Ellie, I don't know this guy,' '' Radatz said.
``Howard said, `He likes the ball up. Keep it down. You have the
control to do it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I lived on the high fastball, but I threw him three
straight fastballs down around his knees and he swung at all three
of them. Afterward, he told a reporter, `I never saw a fastball
like that.' I kept the article.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then Callison came up, and bingo.''
</P>
<P>
   Radatz went out to dinner with his parents after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother, Virginia, said, `Son, it's a privilege just to be
chosen to the team. You did very good.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Mom, I know you're right, but not  &UR; today &LR; .' ''

RED SOX STAY PERFECT 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-DEVIL RAYS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ At this rate, the only question left may
revolve around how many fans intend to be at Logan Airport Sunday
night if the Red Sox finish their season-opening trip undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects a throng like the 10,000 that mobbed Logan when
the '67 Impossible Dreamers returned home with a 10-game winning
streak in August. That was during the summer in a pennant race.
This is April _ before the Boston Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   But these Red Sox, who stand alone as the only team in major
league baseball without a loss after they held on against the Tampa
Bay Devil Rays, 5-3, Saturday &UR;  &LR; night for their fifth straight win,
are stirring spring's annual hope in New England every bit as much
as the crocuses and daffodils blossoming in backyards.
</P>
<P>
   The Sons of Jimy Williams became the first Sox team since the
'46 World Series contestants to open 5-0, and if they can sweep the
Devil Rays Sunday afternoon behind newcomer Pat Rapp, they will be
the first 6-0 Sox team since 1918. The rest of the planet recalls
that as the year World War I ended. Locals cherish it as the last
time the Sox won the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez squashed Tampa Bay hitters like they were the
Florida state bird (the palmetto bug) until they tagged him for
four hits and all of their runs at the start of the eighth; Jose
Offerman continued trying to earn his $26 million contract in the
season's first week; and John Valentin and Troy O'Leary hit home
runs, with O'Leary also hitting a two-run double in the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to him a little bit in the eighth,'' Wade Boggs said of
Martinez, who is 2-0, 27-7 in April and May over the last five
seasons. ``Up until then, he was basically unhittable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have not trailed in 42 innings since the third inning of
their opener at Kansas City, taking advantage of a schedule in
which they don't play a team that had a winning record last year
until they host Cleveland, 15 games into the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still too early _ it doesn't matter,'' Martinez said.
``But I can tell you, we're playing solid. It's not going to be
that easy, but we have a very deep bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be a big surprise, but don't make it too much of a
big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But surely Martinez has spent enough time in Boston to know how
baseball fever can grip the Hub.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston is a small city,'' he said with a smile. ``Hopefully,
we can keep it in Boston, and no one else will know until it's too
late.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who in one stretch struck out 9 of 15 batters and
allowed just three hits, two of them infield singles, said he
wasn't tired in the eighth, when the home team finally awakened.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Cairo singled and Kevin Stocker beat out a bunt that
Martinez probably should have allowed third baseman Valentin to
handle instead of taking himself. Quinton McCracken then lined a
double to center to spoil the shutout, and when Dave Martinez
followed by cracking a two-run double, Williams lifted Martinez for
Jim Corsi.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping in against Corsi was new Tampa Bay strongman Jose
Canseco, who tapped out to Valentin, making him hitless in his
first seven at-bats before the hometown fans, who already have
resorted to some scattered booing. Fred McGriff then swung at
Corsi's first pitch and grounded out to second baseman Jeff Frye.
And when John Flaherty flied out to center, Corsi bounded off the
mound triumphantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really did an outstanding job against the middle part of
their lineup,'' Williams said. ``Nobody out, tying run at the
plate. A big inning for us, a big inning for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez takes great joy in needling Corsi, who leaves no target
untouched in the Sox clubhouse.  &UR; Last night &LR; , Martinez was serious,
for a moment at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corsi's a very good pitcher,'' he said. ``Believe me, as much
as I make fun of him, he knows his duty and has been around
forever. Believe me, I'd give him the ball every time.''
</P>
<P>
   But is he handsome, someone asked?
</P>
<P>
   ``Shhh,'' Martinez said. ``He thinks so, but don't tell him, his
mama told me he's ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gordon walked Wade Boggs to open the ninth but struck out
two of the last three batters for his third save and 46th in a row,
extending his major league record.
</P>
<P>
   How good has the bullpen been in the early going? Sox relievers
have pitched 13 1/3 innings and have allowed just one earned run
(McGriff's home run off Derek Lowe Friday night), two overall.
They've allowed just three hits, while walking six and striking out
14.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary's two-run double after an error by McGriff and a hit
batsman gave the Sox a 2-0 lead in the first, which grew to 3-0
when O'Leary led off the fourth with a drive deep into the
right-field seats for his first home run of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin made it 5-0 in the fifth with his second home run with
Darren Lewis aboard on a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez gave the Devil Rays one chance early, when McGriff
singled off Valentin's glove and Flaherty doubled to left to open
the second. But the Red Sox ace retired Boggs on a checked-swing
comebacker to the mound, Valentin threw out McGriff at the plate on
Danny Clyburn's grounder, and Cairo struck out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was nasty, real nasty,'' Canseco said of Martinez. ``I
think he lost a little bit in the eighth, but I don't think I've
ever seen a ball move so much coming out of a pitcher's hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Offerman, who has had at least two hits in each of the first
five games, tripled and doubled Saturday &UR;  &LR; night and now has eight
extra-base hits, six doubles and two triples.

REVOLUTION POINTLESS IN HOME OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Revolution's home season started in a
familiar manner: A commendable crowd of 18,373 arrived but the team
failed to win Saturday &UR;  &LR; night. The Revolution rallied twice to tie
D.C. United, 2-2, in regulation time before losing the shootout.
</P>
<P>
   And, as player-coach Walter Zenga noted, this was the first time
the Revolution have not lost in regulation time after their first
three games. The semantics become complicated for what has been
described as ``the simplest game,'' but the Revolution should be
encouraged by having played three opponents even.
</P>
<P>
   They recovered from a last-second goal in the first half,
remained compact defensively, and demonstrated attacking
resourcefulness. Jair contrived a free kick out of a spontaneous
dribble through the center of the field, leading to Joe-Max Moore's
second goal of the season, and newcomer Tony Kuhn provided a tall
target to complement Johnny Torres, who converted the Revolution's
second goal in the 83d minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will always play for the win,'' Zenga said. ``It is a big
satisfaction for us that nobody has beaten us (in regulation time)
in three games. We are trying to improve the team and bring the
team on top of the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Revolution have only 3 points in three games, they
have established a style of play that could keep them in
contention, especially during a stretch that continues against
Columbus Saturday and at D.C. United April 24.
</P>
<P>
   They disrupted United, which has 7 points in three games, just
enough to stay in contention, and created just enough offense to
eventually knock the visitors off balance. Moore nearly scored in
the third minute, but hesitated after losing sight of the ball in
the lights and was stripped from behind by Ben Olsen on the edge of
the goal area.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Aunger headed in Marco Etcheverry's cross for the first
goal with 11 seconds remaining on the scoreboard clock of a
45-minute-30-second first half. This was a demoralizing blow for
the Revolution, who had possession in the final minute, but Moore
lost control about 40 yards from the goal. Etcheverry and Jaime
Moreno combined to quickly counterattack, then Aunger redirected
Etcheverry's cross into the far upper corner of the goal, leaving
Zenga no chance.
</P>
<P>
   Moore slammed a perfectly placed free kick into the left side of
the goal four minutes into the second half. But United capitalized
on its midfield dominance to create excellent chances, only to be
stopped by Zenga until Roy Lassiter converted an Olsen cross in the
72d minute.
</P>
<P>
   But the combination of Edwin Gorter in midfield, and Torres's
persistence, paid off for the tying goal.
</P>
<P>
   Gorter, making his first appearance after serving a two-game
suspension, soon placed his stamp on game after replacing Kuhn, who
was picked up after being waived by Chicago last week, in the 69th
minute. His curling shot was tipped for a corner by goalkeeper Tom
Presthus. Then, Gorter combined with Torres, whose shot was blocked
by Carlos Llamosa. But Torres remained composed and sent the
deflection into the far side of the net to tie the score, then ran
50 yards to the bench to embrace Giuseppe Galderisi, who was acting
as assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution entered the match with only one regulation-time
victory in 14 attempts against United. They had thrice surrendered
deciding goals in the final minutes of games, but they maintained
their poise this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed good fight,'' Revolution defender Dan Calichman
said. ``We got right back in the game in the second half and fought
even harder. These are great signs for the future, it shows we are
playing together as a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a real situation, we would have two ties. But, in any case,
we didn't get beat and we'll get the 3 points later.''

BIRDIE RUN HELPS PATE TAKE FLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Steve Pate was just about to make the turn
Saturday when he noticed ``a lot of people appearing out of
nowhere. They started appearing out of the trees like Big Foot.''
Remarkable Pate could notice, considering the zone he was in.
</P>
<P>
   Pate accomplished the remarkable, birdieing seven consecutive
holes _ the seventh through 13th at Augusta National _ to catapult
himself from 1 over par to 6 under. He finished with a 65, the low
round of the tournament, and at 5-under 211 he is just two shots
behind leader Jose Maria Olazabal starting Sunday's final round of
the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like this came out of nowhere,'' Pate said of his
Masters record-breaking streak that, of course, came out of
nowhere. ``It's not like where I've struggled and then did this.
I've played solidly for three days and I expect to do the same
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for nothing is Pate known as ``Volcano.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I have no explanation for what happened out there,''
said Pate. ``I didn't really do anything differently than I did the
first two days. I don't know why. I just made a couple of putts and
it just . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   There is no terrestrial explanation for extraterrestrial golf.
He started the run with a wedge into the par-4 seventh that left
him a 8-foot putt straight uphill. Plop. Followed by a 20-footer on
the par-5 eighth that also went plop. A 9-iron on the ninth left
his ball a foot and a half away, and another plop.
</P>
<P>
   On and on it went, the gallery growing and finally a storm of
people rushing over to see this phenomenon of Steve Pate leveling
Augusta National. On the par-5 13th, Pate hit a lob wedge to 7 feet
for another plop.
</P>
<P>
   Pate tried to explain this zone to those who might make seven
birdies a season or, for the fortunate, seven birdies a month. ``It
just seemed easy,'' he said. ``Everything I was doing was turning
out well. It was probably the easiest stretch of holes I've played
all week.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Miller (1975), Mark Calcavecchia (1992), and David Toms
(1998) held the previous mark of six birdies in a row, but Pate
merely shrugged at the feat. ``I've done it before,'' he said,
though he was not able to remember where or when.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea I had a record,'' he said. ``Actually, the
thought crossed my mind after I made the seventh one. I don't know
why, but it popped into my head I might get my name in the record
book, which might be nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Pate seemed much more nonplussed than the media or the
spectators. ``I've done a lot of amazing things in 15 years, some
good, some bad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And some absolutely incredible.

TORRES ELEVATES GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Johnny Torres was wondering when this day
would come.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution forward had not scored a goal since last June 7
against the Los Angeles Galaxy, spending most of the second half of
his Major League Soccer rookie season on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night he got back on the scoreboard, and his goal in
the 83d minute lifted the Revolution into a 2-2 tie before D.C.
United won the shootout, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   The goal didn't come easily. After a nifty setup pass from
midfielder Edwin Gorter, Torres had his first shot attempt blocked
by a defender but scored on his second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the first shot and it bounced _ I didn't get full
contact on the ball,'' said Torres, a native of Colombia who won
the 1997 Hermann Award as college player of year during his career
at Creighton University. ``Luckily, I was able to get a second shot
at it and I was able to finish. It's very difficult to shoot while
you're running in the opposite direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres sent both of his shots toward the far post. ``As a
forward, you know that the goalie's going to stand at the near
post,'' Torres said. ``It feels good to get a goal. You can't get
frustrated, you can't look for it too hard. That just makes it
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres's goal enabled the Revolution to make their first tying
comeback of the season. In their opener, they led until the final
minutes before Miami sent the game into a shootout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great thing for the team, for myself,'' said Torres
of the comeback. ``Hopefully I can get a little bit of confidence
from it, and hopefully I can knock in a couple more.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ultimate defeat, Torres feels his team showed its
strength. ``I think we showed we can play against anybody in the
league,'' he said. ``D.C.'s a great team, and we proved something
by coming from behind twice. There are little things that we can
work on _ maybe a little more discipline. I really think we have a
lot of potential to go far.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres made a point to say hello after the game to United coach
Thomas Rongen, the former Revolution coach. ``I have a lot of
respect for Thomas Rongen,'' said Torres. ``After all, he's the guy
who believed in me and drafted me out of college.''
</P>
<P>
   In the shootout, Torres took the 12th shot and missed. He
doesn't like that method of deciding tie games. ``It's a sad thing
that it can go to any team,'' Torres said. ``What can you say?
Shootouts are the luck of the draw, and, unfortunately, we couldn't
finish it off. It could have gone either way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what a better way is, but I don't like this way
very much, ever since the MLS started. Maybe it's best to end it
the way the rest of the world does it.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be to call the game a draw.

 &HT;    We don't have to buy abuses from Beijing
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I mailed two pairs of little-girl shoes, wrapped in
pink tissue, to my 4- and 6-year-old granddaughters. Shoes aren't
gifts I send from afar, but these were irresistible _ shiny black
pumps with tiny flowers embossed on them. Of course, they were made
in China.
</P>
<P>
   What should I tell the granddaughters about ``Made in China''?
</P>
<P>
   If they were older, I'd tell them that even though the Chinese
people make perfect shoes for little girls, the Chinese government
still sends people to prison for speaking the truth. I'd tell them
to pay attention to what Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji is saying about
U.S.-China trade relations on his current U.S. visit. (The
70-year-old Zhu spoke in Los Angeles, near Georgia's home, and
soon, he'll be in Denver, where Sydney lives.)
</P>
<P>
   The girls are too little to understand that even though Zhu
smiles a lot, he's done nothing to release hundreds of brave
Chinese young people who marched for freedom 10 years ago and who
are still political prisoners. But someday, I'll tell them the
story of Harry Wu, who broke his back when forced to do impossible
work in a Chinese coal mine. Wu kept criticizing the government
anyhow _ despite five arrests and 19 years in prison. He spoke out
against the Chinese laogai system. Laogai means ``thought reform
through labor,'' hard labor under cruel conditions for those who
refuse to think and talk like the government says they should.
</P>
<P>
   I hope laogai will be history by the time the girls grow up.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is only in first grade, but she can write some Chinese
characters and sing Chinese songs. That's because my daughter Lisa,
her mother, studied in Beijing when she was in college, returning
home just months before the pro-democracy students were killed in
Tiananmen Square. When Lisa returned from China, she talked a lot
about how happy Chinese families are with simple pleasures _ flying
kites together, going to market on their bicycles, sharing an apple
with a stranger from America.
</P>
<P>
   The smiling Zhu says a lot of things we like to hear from a
Chinese leader: how he will open China's markets wider to the
United States, how admission to the World Trade Organization will
further China's market economy. But I can't forget that he also
believes it's none of our business when people are beaten or killed
in China or any other country.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a reason to push aside the human rights stuff, just
because the government of Zhu and President Jiang Zemin allow the
Chinese people to produce and sell more goods than ever? Or because
American corporations want U.S. political leaders to focus
exclusively on trade issues with China?
</P>
<P>
   America cannot respect Zhu's ``none of your business'' rule when
it comes to internal human rights abuses. My granddaughters will
learn that. Like other American children, they ask questions about
the NATO planes they see on television bombing Serbia, about the
Kosovar children who are crying or sick. They understand that bad
people are doing bad things to others who are different from them,
and that the United States is trying to put a stop to it.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has a record $57 billion trade deficit with
China now _ partly because of the Asian financial crisis, but
partly because people like me buy ``Made in China.'' There's no
direct line from a free market to a free society, but there's a
relationship. Tying trade issues to human rights doesn't work
anymore. But I want Sydney and Georgia to learn that standing up
for human rights always does.

Messer worry that motto can be taken to self-defeating extremes.
</P>
<P>
   They worry that Texas isn't going to give them much help once
Della Marie's out of school, even though they helped Texas big-time
almost 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the Lorena couple took Della Marie as a foster
child, later to adopt her.
</P>
<P>
   Texas should be ever in their debt. She could have been in an
institution all that time, costing the taxpayers bundles. Instead,
the Messers raised her.
</P>
<P>
   Someone should slap our faces at this point for talking about
cost. What the Messers did was right, humane, loving. They gave
Della Marie a home, a real home, not a ward, not a sea of tile, not
overseers in shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Messer points out that his daughter had behavior problems
as a toddler. She was a likely candidate for medication _ Thorazine
the drug of choice 20 years ago. She might have spent much of that
time zombie-like.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, representatives of families like the Messers
asked the Senate Appropriations Committee to increase the funding
for home and community services _ HCS.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has close to 10,000 people like Della Marie on a waiting
list for HCS. These are clients of the State Department of Mental
Health-Mental Retardation who are young adults or are approaching
life after school. House budget writers authorized a mere pittance,
enough to take 110 people off the waiting list. MHMR officials are
pleading for funds to remove 800 from the list. A Senate mark-up is
expected this week. Interests compete within the MHMR budget _
state schools vs. community care. The irony is that some families
that don't qualify for HCS end up tearfully turning to institutions
for their grown children.
</P>
<P>
   This is how Texas, always near the bottom in spending on human
services, and proud of it, ends up shortchanging lots of caring
families.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the extent of the disabilities in question, those
on the waiting list need several things. They might need someone to
care for or watch their disabled child when they are away from the
house, at work or simply taking care of other personal matters.
They might need need job training and continuing education for
these children.
</P>
<P>
   Della Marie has one more year in Lorena schools before she
enters unknown territory. Her parents say she'll need to continue
sign-language lessons she's getting in school, or she'll forget
what she's learned. They want her to be in a sheltered workshop to
make more friends and learn some life skills.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Kagle, far less disabled than Della Marie, has been on the
HCS waiting list for five years. His need is different. Adopted as
a Korean orphan by Joe and Anne Kagle of Waco, Chris is 25 and
wants to be in a group living setting, to move out of his parents'
home yet remain in his home town.
</P>
<P>
   HCS is not needed while these children are growing up and in
special education. The school is their support arm. But they can
only go to school until they're 22.
</P>
<P>
   After that, they are home, and in these cases they wait for the
funds for HCS support services or opportunities to relocate in a
community-based living arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   What often happens in cases like Della Marie's is the parents
can't continue to care for a grown child 24 hours a day.
Regretfully, they place the child in an institution, sometimes far
from home.
</P>
<P>
   That's the irony about the waiting list. Rather than
self-sufficiency, some people like Della Marie end up in
institutions costing us bundles. That's some economy measure. Slap
our faces.

 &HT;    Ex-migrant worker reaps harvest of fame
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BAY, Fla. _ When Clarence Anthony goes to the mountaintop,
it's just a short drive.
</P>
<P>
   But the view he gets of his humble hometown from the 40-foot
levee surrounding Lake Okeechobee fills him with an almost
unspeakable pride and contentment.
</P>
<P>
   Raised a dirt-poor migrant farm worker in a time when
opportunities for African-Americans were just opening up after
segregation, Anthony was never expected to climb to the heights of
national prominence.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, though, through a childhood of picking celery in South
Bay and rattling around the country in a school bus with his family
to follow the harvest up the East Coast, he managed to build dreams
and ambitions for a life beyond the vegetable fields.
</P>
<P>
   After working his way through college sacking groceries, Anthony
began fulfilling those dreams when he was elected tiny South Bay's
mayor at the tender age of 24.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 15 years later, he's been recognized by his colleagues from
across the nation as a leader of uncommon skills and vision. In
December, Anthony was elected president of the 17,000-member
National League of Cities, a post that typically goes to chief
executives of giant cities, not struggling farm hamlets like South
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Now the mayor of this one stop-light town sometimes sits at his
government-issue metal desk in his windowless office and takes
calls from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone gets real excited here when one of those calls comes
in,'' said Anthony, who at 38 still looks young enough to be in
college. ``It's been a wonderful experience. Sometimes I pinch
myself because I can't believe I'm serving in a position like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   He certainly overcame the odds to get there.
</P>
<P>
   South Bay is not the kind of town a casual visitor would
identify as a hotbed of national leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Hard by the southern shore of Lake Okeechobee, the town is 90
percent minority, with a per capita income of only $13,000 and a
chronic unemployment rate running near 30 percent. The main reason
for South Bay's existence is to serve the vast fields of sugar cane
and vegetables that stretch, flat as a table top, in nearly every
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Southern blacks migrated here in the 1930s and '40s to do
the backbreaking work of tending the fields, and they were joined
in the 1960s and '70s by equally poor Haitians and other Caribbean
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions for the workers were so bad they spawned famed
journalist Edward R. Murrow's shocking documentary, ``Harvest of
Shame.'' The program, depicting hard labor, low wages and pitiful
living conditions, stunned many Americans who didn't know their
country harbored such misery.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony was right there in those fields, living in a tattered
housing project, spending hours after school each day working the
celery fields. ``It sounds like it was so bad, but I really had a
very loving childhood,'' he said. ``You don't even realize you're
poor when everybody around you is in the same state. We had the
basics _ food, shelter and each other. That was enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony's mother pressed him to stay in school, even when each
academic year was interrupted by the family's yearly treks to
Maryland and New York to follow the harvests.
</P>
<P>
   It was in school that he got his first taste of politics. He
liked it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got elected president of the student body at Glades Central
High School,'' he said. ``Even then I was tinkering with
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   As a ninth-grader, Anthony graduated from working in the celery
fields to an indoor job that paid wages cut by check: a grocery bag
boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had it made,'' he recalls. ``I got to wear a
tie.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony worked at the grocery all through high school, community
college and and even after he enrolled at Florida Atlantic
University in Boca Raton. He remembers telling the produce manager
that he had ambitions to succeed him and to one day become a store
manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he was going to fire me the next day if I kept
talking that way,'' Anthony said, recalling his shock. ``He told me
I could do better than to spend my life in a grocery store.''
</P>
<P>
   After earning a graduate degree in public administration _ and
serving as head of FAU's Student Government Association _ Anthony
did something surprising on his own: He returned to South Bay.
Clearly his hometown had a hold on him, because it was a place of
such limited horizons that many youth with freshly-minted college
degrees would have rushed to leave.
</P>
<P>
   South Bay then didn't look much different from the run-down
village portrayed in Murrow's documentary. A couple of gas stations
and garages, one motel and several liquor stores lined U.S. 27, the
main drag that still roars all day with heavy trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing from his own experience, Anthony decided the way for the
town's poor to rise was through education. His first big project
after he was elected mayor in 1984 was to secure a branch of the
Palm Beach County library for South Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took four years,'' he said. ``The county commissioners and
legislators got so used to hearing my speech they would introduce
me as Clarence `I-want-my-library' Anthony.'' Another big goal
during Anthony's tenure has been to bring more jobs and new
industry to South Bay. On that count, he and his town suffered a
devastating blow.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, South Bay's main employer had been a vegetable
packing house, which in season employed hundreds, giving them just
enough wages to get by. But the packing house closed down in 1994,
taking with it a $17 million payroll and 1,300 jobs _ including
that of Anthony's own mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the lowest,'' Anthony recalls. ``It made me feel like
I had failed. It looked like South Bay might become a ghost town.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony turned to contacts he had made in state government
through his years of activity in groups like the Florida League of
Cities. He secured a prison that soon opened and employed 300
people in steady, good-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Now his goal is to broaden and diversify South Bay's economic
base. Working again with state officials, he arranged for the city
to obtain 170 acres of property that had been confiscated from a
convicted drug dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Already South Bay has opened an RV park on part of the land
nearest the Lake Okeechobee levee, where there are boat ramps for
sportsmen attracted by the lake's world-class bass fishing.
</P>
<P>
   There are plans for a new housing development and a commerce
park that the city hopes will attract small- to medium-sized firms
that would employ a few dozen people each.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony often takes his morning coffee on the levee, reading and
contemplating as he gazes over his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Along with his own career satisfaction, he has enjoyed watching
his son, Reidel, excel in a football career that has taken him from
the University of Florida to the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where
he is now a star wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up he was always the mayor's son,'' Anthony said.
``Now I'm Reidel Anthony's father. I just love that. I'm as proud
of him as of anything I've ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   During his yearlong tenure as the National League of Cities
president, Anthony is stressing the concept of building a sense of
community by involving citizens in the life of their towns.
</P>
<P>
   It's the magnet that has kept him in South Bay, and despite the
town's struggles, he believes it is the glue that holds any
successful community together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you're from Detroit or Orlando or Atlanta, that's what
makes a city work,'' he said. ``People participating, feeling like
this is their home town.

 &HT;    Raleigh-Durham region working together to control growth
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ This high-tech mecca is packaged like one metro
area, routinely referred to as Raleigh-Durham, but it doesn't act
like it.
</P>
<P>
   Even the phone company knows it. Raleigh-Durham isn't in the
same local calling zone. It can be a long-distance charge to dial
from the Durham area to Raleigh 20 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Want a road built? That could require approval of one of two
separate regional transportation authorities that split the metro
area.
</P>
<P>
   Raleigh-Durham is in fact a hodgepodge of communities strung
together by Interstate 40 and a famous research campus, Research
Triangle Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a dominant city,'' says Jim Roberson, the
president of Research Triangle Foundation, the developer of the
park. ``This is a community of communities and each works hard at
maintaining its own identity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people here think it is a strength,'' Roberson said.
</P>
<P>
   But it also complicates the task of managing growth.
Administrators build new schools at a furious pace, but they still
don't have enough to avoid packing classrooms into school
gymnasiums and libraries. Gridlock has metastasized into a daily
menace, burrowing its way into the daily fabric of home life and
workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came down from D.C. in '92. There was no traffic problem
compared to D.C., but we are catching up fast,'' says Gaile
Renegar, an attorney who works in Research Triangle Park. ``There
is a sense it's not being managed, that it's uncontrolled growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Job recruiters have noticed the effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago traffic didn't play a role in job decisions.
Now it has a major influence,'' says Kabir Mahadeva, who directs
recruiting for technical positions for Fortune Personnel
Consultants of Raleigh. Some highly marketable workers refuse to
apply for jobs that would involve traffic-clogged commutes, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   One such person is Donna Bennett, a veteran of computer project
management who won't pursue jobs that could pay $80,000 a year if
they entail a commute on I-40 that will cut into time with her
family. Traffic ``is a critical factor even in things like where I
let my daughter do extracurricular activities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Growth,'' she said, ``is starting to run up smack against
family values.''
</P>
<P>
   Last September, some of the major employers in Research Triangle
Park met with North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt to plead for emergency
funds for better roads. They warned that major expansions could be
threatened by traffic.
</P>
<P>
   One of those companies asking for improvements was the
pharmaceuticals company Glaxo Wellcome, which has nearly 6,000
employees locally. The company takes the traffic risks so seriously
that Bob Ingram, Glaxo's chief executive of worldwide operations,
agreed to chair a regional committee looking into traffic fixes.
</P>
<P>
   New regional efforts _ mostly voluntary strategy sessions
involving government and business leaders _ have raised hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole region is starting to work together a lot better,''
says Bill Shore, Glaxo's director of community affairs. ``We are
probably five years late in doing it, but we are doing it now.''
But for all its downside, growth has plenty of fans here.
Raleigh-Durham has cracked the million population mark and growth
has made sure the metro area stays fresh, with new store concepts,
new restaurants and a barrage of new civic projects that include a
new stadium, a new entertainment and sports arena, plans for a
sports park, a new art museum and a major expansion of a science
and natural history museum.
</P>
<P>
   While Donna Bennett refuses to seek a job that would require
driving on I-40, she quickly points out that her family has
benefited from the area's dramatic economic growth and spreading
pool of entrepreneurial start-ups. Her husband works for one,
commuting sometimes an hour each way to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs have been plentiful and diverse. Research Triangle Park's
heavily wooded setting has drawn big branches of big companies.
IBM's largest single cluster of workers _ 14,000 _ is here, rather
than at the company's headquarters in New York. Raleigh is North
Carolina's state capitol with a plethora of government workers.
Then there's the metro area's concentration of major hospitals and
universities, from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
to Duke University in Durham and North Carolina State in Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   But problems remain. Planners predict the metro area will dirty
its air so much within the next five years that it will fall out of
compliance with federal clean air standards. The pressure to keep
up with growth has frustrated local elected officials. The city of
Cary resorted to water quotas to divvy up future supplies for
predicted development.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials have tried to make progress. A regional transit
authority plans to open a light rail system connecting Durham,
Research Triangle Park, Raleigh-Durham International Airport and
Raleigh by the year 2004. It's run into snags working out details
with the airport and Duke University. And it is still short of
money to complete its first phase, though it has both state and
federal funding and money from a local rental car tax.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, last month a group of business and government leaders
announced its suggestions for how to keep up with transportation
needs. The recommendations include a five-cent increase in the gas
tax statewide, creation of HOV lanes and state legislation to allow
construction of toll roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our challenge,'' says Raleigh planning director George
Chapman, ``is one of more trying to develop some kind of collective
decision-making in the region as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Change in Raleigh-Durham's approach to growth has been slow in
coming, says Mack Paul, a local attorney who has been active in
area growth coalitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is what point along that continuum will we have
the political will that we need to make these changes,'' Paul says.
He favors the idea of a strong regional authority to make growth
work, but he adds, ``Local officials are not going to relinquish
authority without some political pressure or pots of money as
incentives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at what it took in Atlanta for you to do something,'' he
said. ``We are a long way from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Some business leaders, like developer and former Raleigh mayor
Smedes York, say the area doesn't need another layer of government.
Instead they say it needs leaders who are less reactive to
neighborhood fights and willing to allow developments that put
homes, stores and workplaces within walking distance.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the rub of how best to get Raleigh-Durham's
independent communities to work together.
</P>
<P>
   Says Roberson of the Research Triangle Foundation, ``Any notion
to try to force anybody in Durham to do something with folks in
Raleigh would not work. If you're talking about sticks it wouldn't
work. Carrots, maybe it would.

 &HT;    Texas forces truce to tackle growth
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ This college city that never wants to graduate
seems to do everything with the passion of a 20-year-old. Club
music zings and tech geeks are kings. And people jealously protect
their city.
</P>
<P>
   Consider environmentalists: In Atlanta, they negotiate for
parkland and struggle to persuade people to recycle and carpool. In
Austin, they dominate the City Council, mobilize voters, force
tough building restrictions directly on the ballot, scrounge up
money to protect tens of thousands of acres and squash resistance
from developers.
</P>
<P>
   Their handiwork has embroiled the state Supreme Court and
angered Texas legislators, who, frankly, never particularly liked
Austin's liberal lean, which they have to endure every time they
are in session.
</P>
<P>
   So, relationship building hasn't been a strong point. At least
not between the business community and environmental organizations.
Which is why a lunch meeting last year at a hip downtown Mexican
restaurant was so strange.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at a corner table at Guerro's were opposing forces. F.
Gary Valdez, a bank president and the then-chairman of the local
chamber of commerce, was dining with Robin Rather, the president of
a high-tech market research subsidiary and the chairwoman of the
Save Our Springs Alliance, a locally powerful environmental
organization. The two agreed it wouldn't hurt to talk. They weren't
completely correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was ugly. It was awkward. No one knew what to say,''
recalls Rather, whose father is CBS newscaster Dan Rather.
</P>
<P>
   But they agreed to meet again. And after a series of parleys,
SOS and the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce agreed they could
work together. Some people in both organizations still have
difficulty accepting that conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question was,'' Valdez says, `` 'Why should you trust
them? We've never been able to trust them before.' ``
</P>
<P>
   But last year, the chamber and SOS supported referendums that
would expand a downtown convention center, begin construction of an
urban flood control project and set aside $65 million to buy and
preserve up to 15,000 acres to protect water quality.
</P>
<P>
   They both backed Mayor Kirk Watson's efforts to convince the
Computer Sciences Corp. to build a major work complex downtown
rather than in an environmentally sensitive area the corporation
had originally favored.
</P>
<P>
   SOS and a local developers group also have worked out a truce.
The two sides had been bitter adversaries, especially since 1989
when SOS succeeded in putting strict watershed protection measures
on the voting ballot. SOS said it was crucial to protect the area's
drinking water supplies, which come from the city's limestone
canyonland where soils are thin and water pollution can be
particularly damaging.
</P>
<P>
   Developers and the chamber spent $200,000 fighting the watershed
measure and warning that it would crush Austin's growth. Voters
approved it overwhelmingly.
</P>
<P>
   Developers fought the issue all the way to the state Supreme
Court and lost. State legislators have tried to help out
developers, but so far their efforts haven't succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   The rules put sharp limits on the size of parking lots, homes
and buildings in a southwest corner of the metro area that had been
fast growing. Developers have to tag cedar, oak and other trees
over a certain size and face fines if they cut down those they are
supposed to save. They have to build a series of special catch
basins to filter rainwater running off oily parking lots.
Developers find they may need up to six times as much land as they
would for projects in portions of Austin where city officials are
more willing to see growth.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the headaches, chamber president Glenn E. West
acknowledges the measure hasn't been the obstacle to development
that he predicted. But he said it has driven up development costs
and some believe it has added to sprawl by pushing more affordable
projects out to suburbs like Round Rock, where rules are less
restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that Austin is becoming a more expensive city
to live in, but it hasn't slowed the wave of newcomers. The metro
area's population, now just over 1 million people, is expected to
double around the year 2015. Jobs in just the last four years grew
24 percent, fueled by companies like Dell Computer Corp. and
Motorola and numerous small high-tech startups. Austin is almost
always ranked among the nation's top high-tech cities.
</P>
<P>
   It is a young and optimistic town. One in 10 Austin residents is
a student at the University of Texas or other area colleges.
Hiking, hunting and fishing are big pastimes.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Zandan moved here from Massachusetts 22 years ago to
attend the University of Texas. Now 46, he still can't bring
himself to leave the city he loves, even after building
IntelliQuest, a firm that specializes in market research for
high-tech companies. The publicly traded company has 500 employees
and $50 million in annual revenues.
</P>
<P>
   But Zandan and others worry about what continued growth will do
to Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made Austin special in the first place could be lost,''
he said. ``If we don't get ahead of growth Austin will lose its
competitive edge in terms of attracting people with the quality of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of cities, Austin drivers face growing traffic jams.
Some of the worst are on Interstate 35, the main north-south
connection through the city. The interstate cuts straight down the
nation's midsection, through San Antonio, Dallas, Oklahoma City,
Kansas City and Minneapolis. But its slowest drive times are in
Austin, according to the local chamber. The problems are
compounding. The metro area is close to falling out of compliance
with federal air quality standards.
</P>
<P>
   Chamber officials are pushing for construction of a light rail
system and a new north-south highway. More road projects are
possible, but so are battles over them. Environmental and business
leaders agree their truce will be tested by debates over roads and
how much additional development intown areas can handle.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to avoid slipping into the community-splitting
warfare of the past. Says West at the chamber, ``We want to conduct
ourselves in ways that when we are 2 million people _ which we will
be _ we will have the quality of life that people are still happy
they live here. That's a theme that I believe everybody can
embrace.''

   KOSOVO-MAIN _ WASHINGTON _ NATO said Sunday that the air war
against Yugoslavia is expected to go on ``many more weeks.''
Meanwhile, key members of Congress, which is returning Monday after
its Easter recess, are urging President Clinton to begin planning
for the use of U.S. ground forces. Developing. (Shepard, Cox News

   KOSOVO-AIRBASE _ RINAS AIR FIELD, Albania _ In just seven days,
the United States Air Force has turned this sleepy Albanian airport
into a surging Western military airbase which is already moving in
more military supplies than during the Berlin Airlift. For the
airmen and women filling the sandbags and running the air tower,
the biggest headache is the mud. It's rained hard for the past
several nights, and people have up to six inches of water in their
tents when they wake up in the morning. Once the base is fully
operational, it will be one of the busiest air fields in the world.

   KOSOVO-WITNESS _ STANKOVAC, Macedonia _ The horrific stories
ethnic Albanians are bringing from Kosovo to refugee camps here
could make them witnesses for the prosecution in future war crimes
trials. Scores of Western investigators are interviewing the
refugees and are meticulously gathering eyewitness accounts. But
hard evidence is in short supply from some refugees, who say Serb
soldiers and militia wore masks to shield their identities.

   TOPMAYOR _ Clarence Anthony grew up in an impoverished farm
family in one of the nation's poorest towns, but that hasn't
stopped him from success. After toiling in the fields as a boy and
putting himself through college by working in a supermarket,
Anthony was elected mayor of tiny South Bay at the tender age of
24, becoming one of Florida's first African-American mayors.
Fifteen years later, he's still mayor, but much more: Anthony was
recently elected as president of the National League of Cities. We
profile the mayor, whose son happens to be Reidel Anthony, a star
receiver with the NFL Tampa Bay Buccaneers. (MWilliams, Atlanta

   RAP-OPERA (Undated) _ Hip-hop magazines are hailing Prince Paul
as a genius, an Einstein, calling his new CD, ``Prince Among

that may be hyperbole. ``I call it a movie on wax,'' said the

   &UR; MUSIC:  &LR;  SPRINGSTEEN-TOUR (Barcelona, Spain) _ Bruce
Springsteen, rock's living symbol of indefatigable American spirit,
began his world tour here Friday at a moment when American cultural
dominance may not be altogether welcome in Europe. But by pushing
through the particulars of his story-songs to their core of common
feeling, this cultural emissary renewed an international bond. By

   LETTERS-TV-REVIEW (Undated) _ It was probably a mistake to turn
the two-character play, ``Love Letters,'' into a full-fledged

could have been much worse. By Anita Gates.

   NETWORK-AFFILIATES (Undated) _ Two networks, Fox and ABC, made
decisions last week that were directly antithetical to the interest
of their affiliates. If that message was not clear enough,
executives at both networks underscored in interviews that the
moves were part of efforts to redefine totally the
network-affiliate relationship _ with the network looking to pocket
the proceeds from the redefinition. By Bill Carter.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-IPO-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ As Internet-related
companies get eager to go public while the getting's good, at least
200 IPO's could be in the offing before August. Many other
companies are already being turned away by investment bankers too
busy to take on new IPO clients. By Edward Wyatt.

   DAVENPORT-RACE (Undated) _ Chester C. Davenport does not deny
that he got a piece of the Ameritech Corp.'s $3.3 billion sale of
half of its wireless telephone business, at least in part, because

JOURNALISM REVIEW CHANGES APPROACH  
 COVER OF FORTUNE RAISES RIVALS' EYEBROWS  
 ANOTHER APOLOGY BY `60 MINUTES' 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX KUCZYNSKI and FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Faced with an environment in which media practices
are scrutinized by every outlet from consumer magazines like
Brill's Content to an ever-multiplying band of Internet scribes,
The Columbia Journalism Review is rethinking its approach.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Konner, the publisher of the Review since 1988, will step
down on July 1. David Laventhol, a longtime newspaper executive who
has been publisher of The Los Angeles Times, publisher and editor
of Newsday and president of the Times Mirror Co., will take her
place. Laventhol retired from Times Mirror last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Goldstein, dean of Columbia University's Graduate School of
Journalism, said that the appointment of Laventhol _ whose name is
closely associated with New York Newsday _ was a step toward
retooling the approach of the Review, a bimonthly with a
circulation of about 30,000 that is published out of the journalism
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``CJR was first published in 1962, and that's almost 40 years
ago,'' Goldstein said. ``It is an understatement to say that
journalism has changed considerably since then. And it's also an
understatement to say that journalism criticism has grown up since
then. But there's a lot of it out there and some of it is very good
and some of it just adds to the noise. What we have now is an
opportunity to really think about what we should be doing, and we
can spend the next year trying to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's on the table,'' Goldstein said. ``From an
enhanced Web presence, to changing its size, to changing the
frequency of the magazine's appearance to either more or less. We
have a little bit of time in which we can make these decisions and
we will do it with deliberation.''
</P>
<P>
   Laventhol said he was not yet sure how he would specifically
shift the magazine's perspective, but he said he was keenly aware
of the ever-growing arena of media critique.
</P>
<P>
   Laventhol had resigned from his duties at Times Mirror partly
because he has Parkinson's disease, but he said that he had been
taking medication for about a year ``that has given me a lot of
energy and endurance and enables me to do this job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit of an awkward discussion, but I am fine,'' he
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cover of Fortune Raises Rivals' Eyebrows
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Fortune magazine ran different covers on the
same issue, and half of the split run has the other financial
magazines buzzing.
</P>
<P>
   One version of the issue dated April 12 announces ``Speed
Sells!'' across a picture of Jeff Gordon, Nascar's 1998 driver of
the year. It was sent to subscribers and was sold on newsstands in
the South, most of the Midwest and as Fortune's managing editor,
John Huey, put it, ``wherever there are motorheads.''
</P>
<P>
   The other cover, which featured an article about Levi Strauss &AMP;
Co., displayed a curvy female bottom clad in a pair of fashionably
snug Levi's jeans and was sold in markets more amenable to bottoms
on newsstands: New York and most of the East Coast, Chicago and
California.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis D'Vorkin, the executive editor of Forbes magazine,
criticized the Levi's cover as sensational. ``It was a cover solely
for the purposes of titillation and had nothing to do with the
thrust of the story,'' he said. ``When you look at that cover, you
think, Levi's is a sexy company on the move. The story, if you read
it, says Levi's is a disastrous scenario. It was deceptive.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for McGraw-Hill's Business Week, Robert Pondiscio,
said that the Levi's cover had been the subject of discussion and
that the general consensus was that ``it looks like John Huey's bid
to become editor of Maxim magazine.'' He was referring to the
popular men's magazine that often features female models on its
cover.
</P>
<P>
   Huey said that he based his decision to run split covers largely
on research that suggested that ``Nascar sells really well in
certain parts of the country and doesn't sell in other parts of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Huey said that he was not guilty of sensationalism. He said that
his competitors at Forbes and Business Week were jealous.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not our model for how to sell on the newsstand,'' Huey
said. ``And Maxim isn't either, come to think of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Final sales figures for the two covers of Fortune, which is
owned by Time Warner, won't be available for months.
</P>
<P>
   Another Apology by `60 Minutes'
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in four months, the CBS News program ``60
Minutes'' is acknowledging that it was snookered.
</P>
<P>
   A statement prepared for Sunday night's broadcast says that a
1997 report on drug smuggling at the California-Mexico border
highlighted a supposedly official memo that was actually a fake.
The memo, designed to look as if it came from the local district
director of the service, called on Customs agents to process ``as
quickly as possible'' the trucks owned by a company linked to
Mexican drug cartels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have concluded that we were deceived,'' the CBS statement
reads. The Customs Service, it says, was correct in saying that the
memo was ``fraudulent'' and that ``60 Minutes'' had been ``the
victim of a hoax.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement also apologizes to Rudy M. Camacho, the San
Diego-based district director of the Customs Service, whose name
was attached to the bogus memo, featured at the end of a report by
correspondent Mike Wallace and producer Lee Zeidman.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the program's executive producer, Don Hewitt,
apologized on the air for broadcasting an independent filmmaker's
report about drug smuggling, which also contained faked material.
That June 1997 report, broadcast two months after the Mexican
border report, purported to show people described as Colombian drug
couriers swallowing heroin-filled latex containers before their
flights to London. A British newspaper, The Guardian, later
reported that the film maker hired the purported couriers to play
scripted roles.
</P>
<P>
   Camacho filed a defamation suit a year ago against CBS over the
report. When asked for comment on the case Friday, both Camacho's
lawyer, David Hicks, and the ``60 Minutes'' spokesman, Kevin
Tedesco, offered an identical one-sentence response: ``The matter
was amicably resolved.''

BRITISH ARCHITECT WINS $100,000 PRITZKER ARCHITECTURE PRIZE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir Norman Foster, the British architect whose work celebrates
the power of modern building technology, has been awarded the
Pritzker Architecture Prize for 1999. The prize, which includes a
stipend of $100,000, is to be presented at a ceremony on June 6 in
Berlin, where Foster has recently completed a redesign of the
historic Reichstag building.
</P>
<P>
   Other prominent buildings designed by Foster, who is 73, include
the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp. in Hong Kong, Stansted
Airport outside London, and the Sainsbury Center for Visual Arts,
in Norfolk, England.
</P>
<P>
   Foster is the second British architect to be honored with the
Pritzker Prize, considered the profession's most prestigious award.
The first, James Stirling, was awarded the prize in 1981. Unlike
Stirling, however, Foster has remained faithful to esthetic
concepts developed by the modern movement in the early decades of
the century: the bold expression of structure, a lavish use of
glass, and dramatic interior spaces unimpeded by walls.
</P>
<P>
   At the 47-story Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp., perhaps
Foster's best known project, tall, thin slabs of metal, glass and
concrete appear to be clamped together by three immense steel
trusses.
</P>
<P>
   For the Sainsbury Art Center, he designed a hangarlike
structure: a metal space frame, inset with glass, in the form of an
inverted U. His design for the Carre d'Art in Nimes, France,
emphasized formal and structural affinities between modern
architecture and the classical vernacular of the adjacent Maison
Carree.
</P>
<P>
   Born to a working-class family in Manchester in 1935, Foster has
refined an esthetic whose roots lie in the Industrial Revolution
and in the split that developed in the 19th century between
architecture and engineering.
</P>
<P>
   It is fitting that the Pritzker Prize will be awarded to Foster
in Berlin, for that is where architects sought to eliminate that
split by deriving forms from modern structural techniques in the
period between the world wars. Foster's design for the Reichstag,
which features a glass dome enclosing spiral ramps, is a crowning
achievement of this 20th-century tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The Pritzker Prize will be presented at the Altes Museum, a
Neo-Classical landmark designed by Karl Friedrick Schinkel in
1923-30. A reception will then be held at the New National Gallery,
the final work of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, which was completed in
1967.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1979, the Pritzker Architecture Prize is sponsored by
the Hyatt Foundation of Los Angeles. The jury for this year's prize
included J. Carter Brown, Giovanni Agnelli, Ada Louise Huxtable,
Toshio Nakamura, Jorge Silvetti and Lord Rothschild. Bill Lacy was
executive director. Previous winners include Philip Johnson, Luis
Barragan, I.M. Pei, Aldo Rossi, Alvaro Siza, Tadao Ando and Renzo
Piano.

BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN AND THE E STREET BAND TAP AN INTERNATIONAL
LANGUAGE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANN POWERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARCELONA, Spain _ ``As You Know, You Are the Boss,'' read a
red, white and blue banner flung over the highest balcony of the
Palau San Jordi arena here on Friday night, hailing Bruce
Springsteen in the oddly formal language of translation, as he
began his European tour in the same arena where Michael Jordan
displayed a different form of prowess during the 1992 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen, rock's living symbol of indefatigable American
spirit, entered Europe at a moment when American cultural dominance
may not be altogether welcome. But by pushing through the
particulars of his story-songs to their core of common feeling,
this cultural emissary renewed an international bond. His music was
much more confident than the careful Spanish with which he
occasionally greeted the zealous crowd. His message, of freedom
found in personal heroism and communal empathy, came clear not only
in the words that these fans had memorized but in his dependably
inspiring sound as well.
</P>
<P>
   The show reasserted Springsteen's belief in what he called ``the
ministry of rock.'' ``I can't offer you everlasting life,'' he
preached during ``Light of Day.'' ``But I can promise life right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for Springsteen's vigor is his reunion with the
eight-piece E Street Band, prompted by the release of the Columbia
boxed set ``Tracks'' last November. Springsteen's longtime group,
which had not toured together in a decade, is as emblematic of
democratic camaraderie as Springsteen is of proletarian striving.
With all members present, including the original guitarist, Steve
Van Zandt, and his successor, Nils Lofgren, and the singer Patti
Scialfa, who joined in the 1980s and later became Springsteen's
wife, 1999's E Street Band represents an accord dismissing past
differences in favor of longstanding pacts and familial
connections.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the show band members hugged, shared microphones and
beamed at one another, showing delight that seemed real, though not
at all spontaneous. If at times they seemed to be enacting a revue
about rock instead of a plain old rock show, no one in the arena
minded. E Street Band shows have always been highly staged affairs.
Fans welcomed cues as corny as the guitarists lining up to play a
riff, or the brawny saxophonist Clarence Clemons lifting the
diminutive Lofgren out of the way to get at the vocal microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Actual spontaneity would not have been as rousing as these
familiar signs of fun, especially across the lines of nation and
language. On Friday old moves were revived while new ones claimed a
place. At 49 Springsteen is neither the runty dreamer he was early
on, nor the ascendant action hero of the mid-1980s. He played the
patriarch, surveying his compadres like one of the likable padrones
in ``The Sopranos,'' the popular HBO mini-series in which Van Zandt
is a co-star. When Springsteen wiggled his hips, he seemed like
Otis Redding; in more somber moments, like the acoustic ``The Ghost
of Tom Joad,'' he evoked Woody Guthrie.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly he played Bruce Springsteen, the outsider who found
citizenship amid fellow strivers who still believe in ``the
promised land.'' ``Sometimes I feel so weak I wanna explode,'' he
sang in the song named for that biblical image. It is an emblematic
Springsteen lyric, expressing vulnerability and virility in one
compelling stroke. ``The Promised Land,'' like ``Badlands,''
``Thunder Road,'' ``Backstreets'' and many other favorites offered
alongside quieter picks like ``The Streets of Philadelphia'' and
``Mansion on the Hill,'' blended the lyrical strains of Clemons'
saxophone, Roy Bittan's piano and Danny Federici's keyboards with
the brawn of all those guitars. (Ms. Scialfa also played
acoustically.)
</P>
<P>
   In Barcelona the sound's links to florid Mediterranean pop
traditions surfaced, especially in Springsteen's ardent vocals and
the melancholy core of his melodies. But the music was also
emphatically American in its blend of the homey and the grand, the
conventional and the seemingly unbound.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen and his band took some chances. A new version of
``Youngstown'' turned that acoustic tale of woe into a bitter
rocker. ``She's the One,'' a ballad two decades old, was
resurrected in a spellbinding version driven by Springsteen's tense
vocals and the skipping heartbeat of Max Weinberg's drums. The
night's one new song, ``Land of Hope and Dreams,'' was a
self-conscious attempt at a modern-day spiritual that did not
completely coalesce. In the bit of new choreography most likely to
endure, Springsteen traded vocals with Van Zandt, Lofgren, Ms.
Scialfa and Clemons in a hymnlike take on the lovely ballad ``If I
Should Fall Behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally though, it was a patented E Street Band show, with
much emotion generated on cue. Not every cultural divide was
crossed; the crowd filled the empty moments between songs with
distinctly European soccer chants. But the pleasure palpable
everywhere showed that Springsteen and his band can still tap the
healing power of their own personal, universal language.

BEETHOVEN VIA TOKYO WITH A RUSSIAN TOUCH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Beethoven string quartets, a specialty of the
Tokyo String Quartet in its earlier configurations, have been
notably absent from one listener's experience of the group since
Mikhail Kopelman became first violinist in 1996. So a special
curiosity attached to the performance of Beethoven's C major
``Razumovsky'' Quartet (Op. 59, No. 3) that ended the Tokyo's
concert on Wednesday evening at Alice Tully Hall.
</P>
<P>
   It was a marvel. True, the deck was stacked a bit with this
work, tinged as it is with Russian folk music, since Kopelman, who
was trained in Russia, has given the group a certain Slavic quality
of its own. But the unanimity of spirit here was remarkable by any
standard, and individual voices were no less impressive on their
own.
</P>
<P>
   Sadao Harada, the cellist, gave the Andante a firm grounding
with his squarely tuned and resoundingly plucked bass notes.
Kazuhide Isomura, the violist, set the fugue of the finale spinning
with fine rhythmic definition and delicious vigor and was answered
in kind by Kopelman, Harada and Kikuei Ikeda, the second violinist.
In all, the work sounded freshly minted and brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   The Tokyo also gave a compelling account of a work that was
freshly minted, the Third Quartet by Michio Mamiya, a 69-year-old
Japanese composer, subtitled ``A Song of the White Wind.'' Vaguely
programmatic in relation to the American Indian god of the wind,
and amiably asymmetric, the work offsets an engaging, angularly
stated thesis in the first movement with a sentimental antithesis
in the second, offering no attempt at synthesis.
</P>
<P>
   As gripping as many of the Tokyo's interpretations have been
with Kopelman, there has been a persistent unevenness in the
quality of performance, whether because certain works have yet to
settle into the altered group's repertory or because Kopelman is
slow to warm up.
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, the first performance in the program, in this
case, Schumann's A minor Quartet (Op. 41, No. 1), was the least
impressive, because of sour or slightly mistuned attacks from
Kopelman: something perhaps in keeping with Russian style but
foreign to the Tokyo's. Still the group conveyed the work's
Mendelssohnian spirit in exuberant fashion.

A VACCINE THAT MAY PREVENT SHINGLES  
 GETTING THE GOODS OUT OF A BOTTLE 
SAFER STICKS FOR FLAG WAVERS 
SAVING MONEY BY REUSING STEAM 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Md., Mass.)   By Teresa Riordan   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chicken pox is a classic childhood ailment that can leave a kid
housebound with a sore throat, fever, and itchy sores. After two
weeks, the chicken pox symptoms usually have vanished, but the
varicella-zoster virus lingers behind, hiding in sensory nerve
cells near the spinal cord. It lies dormant through adulthood when,
for some people, it becomes active again, causing another disease _
shingles.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 600,000 to 1.2 million cases of shingles occur
every year, in the elderly or in people whose immune systems are
compromised. ``It can be very painful because it pinches the nerve
cells,'' said Dr. Abbas Vafai, chief of biologics at the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. ``The rash area
causes excruciating pain. It may last for four weeks or longer.''
</P>
<P>
   While antiviral drugs can reduce the length of the rash, no drug
currently available prevents the disease from occurring or
recurring. Vafai hopes that a vaccine he recently patented will do
exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a vaccine currently available against chicken pox,''
Vafai said. ``But it uses a live, attenuated virus. While it is
very effective against chicken pox, the vaccine itself becomes
latent again and can reactivate later in life to cause shingles.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of using a live virus to create his vaccine, Vafai took
a piece of a glycoprotein _ which attaches to the surface of the
varicella-zoster virus _ and chopped it off at one end. The
remaining part of the glycoprotein stimulates the immune system to
produce virus-neutralizing antibodies, which when used as a
vaccine, Vafai said, would prevent a dormant virus already in the
body from reactivating and causing shingles.
</P>
<P>
   So far Vafai's vaccine has been tested on lab animals. He was
granted patent 5,824,319, which has been assigned to Research Corp.
Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the Goods Out of a Bottle
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's shampoo or ketchup, the problem is the same: how to
get those last dribs and drabs out of the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Moheb M. Ibrahim, a machinist in Baltimore, thinks he has solved
the problem with his recently patented double-ended bottle.
</P>
<P>
   The bottle looks like a normal bottle with one big exception: It
has a neck and opening at each end. Although the necks of the
bottle are narrow, the caps that cover them are wide, so that the
bottle will be stable resting on either end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The caps are larger to allow the bottle to stand freely, and
there's a plug in the caps to keep the product from leaking,''
Ibrahim said.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim hopes to license patent 5,829,607.
</P>
<P>
   Safer Sticks For Flag Wavers
</P>
<P>
   Carol Goodman Kaufman, a mother of three, used to think of
flag-waving as a harmless fun for kids. Until, that is, she saw a
girl almost get her eye poked out by an overzealous flag-wielding
sister at a holiday celebration a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kaufman has patented a flag stick made of a flexible foam
plastic that bends when jabbed into a firm object.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kaufman now sells her Flexi-Flags through her one-woman
business in Worcester, Mass. She received patent 5,862,773.
</P>
<P>
   Saving Money By Reusing Steam
</P>
<P>
   An inventor in New York City has patented a way to cut energy
costs for factories that use high-pressure steam in their
production processes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, they just vent the exhaust steam into the
atmosphere,'' said Gerald Fisher, whose system captures excess
steam and diverts it into a series of pipes and valves so that it
can be used to heat the plant.
</P>
<P>
   One of his systems, Fisher said, has been installed at the
Smurfit-Stone Corp.'s plant in Wakefield, Mass., which uses
high-pressure steam to stiffen and dry cardboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not 100 percent efficient,'' he said. ``But they've been
saving 15 percent of their total energy bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher and Joseph Manaseri received patent 5,865,369.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent

`LOVE LETTERS:' RICH FOLKS, ONE INSCRUTABLE, THE OTHER VULNERABLE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When rich people go bad, at least in fiction, they do it in one
of two ways. Like Andrew Makepeace Ladd III, they shut down
emotionally and rely on taste and convention to make life seem
controllable. Or like Melissa Gardner, they seek out sensation and,
intoxicated by the freedom that money allows, eventually drown.
</P>
<P>
   It was probably a mistake to turn Andy and Melissa's
two-character epistolary play, ``Love Letters,'' into a
full-fledged television movie (Monday night on ABC). But there are
enormously talented people at work here: A.R. Gurney wrote the
script, based on his own play, and Stanley Donen, doing his first
television project at the age of 75, directed.
</P>
<P>
   So it's safe to say that in less gifted hands the result could
have been much worse, given the inevitable loss of impact when
described events are acted out and visible, rather than revealed a
sentence at a time through the written word. For those who missed
the stage production, it's worthwhile seeing the film just to get
to know the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love Letters'' was first performed in New York in 1989 by
Kathleen Turner and John Rubinstein. Over the years scores of
couples from Brat Pack members to Jayne Meadows and Steve Allen
have taken a turn in the roles, in New York and Los Angeles. For an
actor it's a low-commitment job: minimal rehearsals, no sets, no
costume changes; the two characters just sit at a table side by
side and read.
</P>
<P>
   Now Laura Linney, who has played some intriguing variations on
all-American innocence (in ``The Truman Show'' and in Armistead
Maupin's ``Tales of the City''), is Melissa, and Steven Weber, best
known for the sitcom ``Wings,'' is Andy. Ms. Linney makes every
facial expression enchanting. Weber stands there like a lump,
resistant to emotion even when his father dies; but that's
certainly true to character. It would just be nice if at times we
could see an emotion trying to bubble to the surface before he
pushes it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love Letters'' begins in the characters' childhoods, with an
invitation to Melissa's seventh birthday party and her thank-you
note for Andy's gift. It follows the characters through boarding
school, college, war, marriages, children, divorce, career
decisions, alcoholism and, finally after all those years, an
affair. With each other. In the end (and in the beginning, in the
television version), Andy is a middle-aged U.S. Senator, coming
home from Melissa's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone familiar with Gurney's work knows that his characters are
almost always affluent East Coast WASPs, and these two are no
exception. In one letter Andy apologizes to Melissa's nanny. He
remembers her family's butler bringing them ginger ale and cookies
on a silver tray.
</P>
<P>
   But Melissa at least is irreverent about it all. In college she
turns up for the Yale-Harvard game in a new red convertible,
announcing: ``Granny died. She left me tons of dough.'' She never
loses her sense of humor. Years later, when Andy's annual Christmas
card, with family photograph, arrives (``Joy to the world from all
the Ladds _ Andy, Jane, Drew, Nicholas and Ted''), she replies with
one sentence, ``Remind me to send a check to Planned Parenthood.''
</P>
<P>
   She always bounces back: after her husband cheats on her, she
loses custody of her daughters, and she pays a return visit to the
drying-out center with the rolling green lawns. She keeps traveling
and painting and having shows in SoHo, until finally it's all too
much. Andy is such an idiot that he never notices, over the
decades, that Melissa's descents into drinking and depression
always come right after he has disappointed her. That's his
tragedy.

WAR-VETERAN (Kansas City, Mo.) Ben Alvarado, a World War II
veteran, recently returned to Germany and now grapples with
memories of the war's effect on his brother. By DONALD BRADLEY.
Story will move in the ``a'' category.

   MASS-MURDER (Kansas City, Mo.) _ As the details of five puzzling
murders begin to unfold, the neighborhood where the crimes occurred
still is trying to recover from the shock. By MATT CAMPBELL. Story
will move in the ``a'' category.
SPRINT-CHIEF (Undated) Call him the $280 million man. That's the
windfall _ so far _ that Sprint Corp. Chief Executive Officer
William T. Esrey stands to collect when he cashes in the gargantuan
stock option grants he has received in the past two years. Forget
his salary and bonus. Options alone have earned him the equivalent
of $2.7 million a week, $538,000 per workday, or $67,000 an hour,
as of the close of business Friday. The company response, however,
echoes others caught up in the national debate about the widening
wage gap between executives and workers. By TED SICKINGER. Story
will move in the ``f'' category.
MILITARY-CONFLICTS (Undated) Although U.S. involvement in
Yugoslavia and Iraq do not yet meet the Pentagon's idea of a major
war, every sortie flown and each missile launched pushes America's
military closer to its limits. Likewise, flights bringing relief
supplies to Kosovar refugees or whisking those exiles out of the
region further tax American military wherewithal. The danger,
experts say, is a small but growing risk that U.S. forces could
find themselves shorthanded if trouble cropped up elsewhere. By
SCOTT CANON. Story will move in the ``w'' category.
Y2K-BILL (Undated) Customers stacked up 20 deep in 1995 on the
opening day of a gourmet grocery in Warren, Mich., before finally
walking out in a huff.
</P>
<P>
   The swipe of a single credit card with a year 2000 expiration
date had crashed the Produce Palace's computer register, which was
high-tech but not Y2K-compliant.
</P>
<P>
   That made owner Mike Yarsike an early victim of the Y2K bug. He
settled for $260,000 from the cash register company after becoming
one of the first victims to file a Y2K lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But few others will have that option if some federal and state
lawmakers have their way. By FINN BULLERS. Story will move in the
``w'' category.

RETURN TO GERMANY IS POIGNANT JOURNEY FOR WORLD WAR II VETERAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONALD BRADLEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, MO. _ Two pieces of paper. One more than a
half-century old, the other new.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Alvarado sat at his kitchen table and tried to fit the two
together like a puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   The first was a worn photograph taken in 1944 of his brother,
Mike. It showed a young soldier with bright eyes, shiny gold
buttons on his lapel and a confident, almost cocksure, smile.
</P>
<P>
   The other was an invitation to Ben Alvarado and other members of
the 80th Infantry Division to return to Weimar, Germany, where in
April 1945 they took part in a bizarre capture _ involving a
bicycle courier and a sleepy mayor _ that ended World War II for
the small German town.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Weimar now want those GIs to return for a
celebration of life, and to thank the American soldiers for sparing
their town that day 54 years ago Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the Bible says, `Love thy enemy,' but this is
confusing,'' Alvarado said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   There was no humor. His chuckle was a plea to help him
understand.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Alvarado, who loved to sing and dance to swing music, had
lied about his age to get into the Army. He was full of spunk and
wanted to go where his brother, Ben, was. Their parents were dead.
</P>
<P>
   Mike was only 17 when he landed on Utah Beach on D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   He lost his vigor in places such as Cherbourg and Bastogne. He
came back to Kansas City, Mo., in 1945 and spent the next 20 years
in mental hospitals. Then he lived with Ben for 24 years in south
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Mike never recovered. He never held a job. He never married.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were you at Cherbourg?'' he would ask strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ben Alvarado, who landed on Omaha Beach and was later shot
and spent three months in a hospital, has been invited to celebrate
life with a country that took so much from him.
</P>
<P>
   And he accepted. He arrived in Weimar Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll make friends there,'' he said last week before leaving.
``I'm easy to get along with.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he holds no bitterness toward the German soldiers. They
were following orders, just like he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were scared and they cried, just like us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he sees the strangeness of a mutual celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The trip is highly unusual, said a spokesman for the Veterans of
Foreign Wars.
</P>
<P>
   Weimar isn't in France or Belgium, countries that were liberated
by Allied forces and where citizens embraced American GIs. Many
reunions have been staged in those places.
</P>
<P>
   But Germany was the enemy. Its people weren't liberated. They
were defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of another case where a German city has wanted to
thank American GIs,'' VFW spokesman Bill Smith said from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Gerlinde Schmidt, a Weimar resident who helped arrange the
reunion, said the town wanted to thank the American soldiers for
capturing the city ``without running blood.''
Ben Alvarado, 73, lives in south Kansas City. He's been married 50
years to his wife, Victoria, and the couple raised five children.
He has a pet donkey and seldom misses church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to lie to anybody,'' he said last week. ``I
wasn't a very good soldier.''
</P>
<P>
   He was just a guy who was drafted at age 18 and went where he
was told and did what he was told.
</P>
<P>
   That meant landing at Omaha Beach on D-Day. The first wave was
still pinned on the beach when his outfit scrambled ashore 30
minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't fighting. We were just being shot at. We couldn't
see anything and it was so loud,'' Alvarado said. ``I knew it was
the end of my life ... There was no way to get out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, he figured, Mike was doing pretty much the same
thing. Because of secrecy of the D-Day landing, Alvarado had just
learned that his brother had joined the Army and had actually
beaten him to England.
</P>
<P>
   Ben was mad, but understood. Mike had always wanted to tag along
when Ben would go off with friends.
</P>
<P>
   Ben wrote Mike: ``Take care of yourself. I'll see you back in
Kansas City.''

LAWSUITS RELATED TO Y2K PROBLEM START TRICKLING INTO THE COURTS

 By   BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A trickle of new lawsuits in recent months is expanding the
legal landscape of the Year 2000 computer problem. But so far, the
cases offer little support for the dire predictions that courts
will be choked by litigation over Y2K, as the problem is known.
</P>
<P>
   Some major equipment vendors, including IBM, AT&AMP;T and Lucent
Technologies Inc., for example, have joined the ranks of those
being sued for not forewarning customers that equipment they sold
in recent years cannot handle Year 2000 dates and for not supplying
free upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   A California suit claims that Circuit City Stores Inc., CompUSA
Inc. and other mass-market retailers violated that state's unfair
business practices law by not warning customers about Year 2000
problems in computers and other equipment they sold.
</P>
<P>
   And an Alabama lawyer sued the state of Alabama on behalf of two
welfare recipients, asking that the state be ordered to set aside
money to upgrade its computer systems to ensure that benefits will
be delivered without interruption.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such skirmishes, though, which lawyers say only offer
hints of the wide variety of cases yet to come, there is no sign
yet of the kind of high-stakes damage suits that some have
projected could overwhelm courts with $1 trillion in claims.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, while Congress and many state legislatures are suddenly
awash in proposed laws meant to prevent such a tidal wave, many
lawyers actively involved with Year 2000 issues now question just
how big the litigation threat really is.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was more reason to be alarmed a year ago,'' said Wynne
Carvill, a partner at Thelen, Reid &AMP; Priest in San Francisco, one
of the first law firms to devote major resources to Year 2000.
``People are finding things to fix but not many that would shut
them down.''
</P>
<P>
   The work and the litigation stems from the practice in older
computers and software programs of using two digits to denote the
year in a date; some mistakenly read next year's ``00'' as meaning
1900, and others do not recognize it as a valid number.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between 50 and 80 cases linked to the Year 2000
problem have been filed so far, according to various estimates. The
vast majority focus on whether hardware and software vendors are
obligated to pay for fixing or replacing equipment and programs
that malfunction when they encounter Year 2000 dates.
</P>
<P>
   When such cases involve consumer products, a key issue has been
whether lawsuits could be filed before any malfunctions have
actually occurred. Plaintiffs lawyers have likened the situation to
a car known to have a safety hazard; Detroit would be expected to
take the initiative, send out recall notices to car owners and pay
for the fix before an accident occurred, they say.
</P>
<P>
   But in the major rulings so far, courts in California and New
York have concluded that the law in those states does not treat the
fast-changing, low-cost world of consumer software like cars.
</P>
<P>
   Actions against Intuit Inc., the manufacturer of Quicken, a
popular financial package, have been dismissed because consumers
were unable to demonstrate that they had already been damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit has promised to make free software patches available
before next Jan. 1, but is fighting efforts by plaintiffs' lawyers
in California to force the company to compensate consumers who
dealt with the problem by purchasing upgrades before learning of
the free fix.
</P>
<P>
   The case against mass retailers, filed in Contra Costa County,
Calif., in January, argues that the stores violated a state
consumer protection statute by selling a wide array of software,
including Windows 98 and certain versions of Quicken, Microsoft
Works, Peachtree Accounting and Norton Anti-Virus, without warning
customers about potential Year 2000 problems or supplying free
patches from the manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where consumers were told of software defects, the
complaint contends, they were sometimes told that the least
expensive solution was to buy an upgrade from the store, even
though the manufacturers had a stated policy of providing free
patches.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint also cites hardware with Year 2000 defects that
was sold in the stores without warning, including equipment from
Compaq Computer, NEC and Toshiba from 1995 to 1997. It also
contends that as recently as this year, the stores have been
packaging a wide variety of new computers with software that
contains Year 2000 defects.
</P>
<P>
   The stores have moved to dismiss the suit, arguing among other
things that failing to warn consumers about defects does not amount
to misleading them under the California law.
</P>
<P>
   Many other cases have involved business software, services and
computer equipment, but lawyers describe them largely as ``plain
vanilla'' contract disputes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The first case to result in a settlement paying damages to a
plaintiff involved Produce Palace International, a Warren, Mich.,
grocery that had complained that its business had been repeatedly
interrupted by the failure of a computerized checkout scanning
system to read credit cards expiring in the Year 2000. In the
settlement, reached last November, the vendor, TEC America Inc., an
Atlanta-based unit of the TEC Corp. of Japan, paid Produce Palace
$250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Several software manufacturers have settled suits on terms that
provide free upgrades and payments to the lawyers that sued them.
Last month, for example, a magistrate for U.S. District Court in
New Jersey approved a settlement that provided up to $46 million in
upgrades and $600,000 in cash to doctors who had purchased billing
management software from Medical Manager Corp.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the end of Year 2000 problems for Medical Manager,
which is based in Tampa, Fla. It still has to contend with a
shareholder lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Florida last
fall after its stock tumbled on the news of the New Jersey
class-action suit. Several other shareholder suits have been filed
against other software companies based on claims linking Year 2000
problems to stock declines.
</P>
<P>
   In general, defendants have fared well in Year 2000 business
software cases. Courts have strictly interpreted contracts and
licenses to prevent plaintiffs from collecting on claims for
upgrades or services unless they were specifically called for in
the contract.
</P>
<P>
   In December, an Ohio court threw out a potential class-action
claim against Macola Inc., a software company, contending that
early versions of its accounting program with Year 2000 defects
should be upgraded for free because the company advertised it as
``software you'll never outgrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that anyone actually licensing the software
accepted the explicit and very limited terms of the warranty as all
that Macola had legally promised. That decision has been appealed.
</P>
<P>
   One closely watched case involves the Cincinnati Insurance Co.'s
request that a U.S. District Court in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, declare
that the company is not obligated to defend or reimburse a client
that has been sued on an accusation that it failed to provide
hospital management software free of Year 2000 defects.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first case to raise the question of whether insurance
companies may be ultimately liable for much of the hundreds of
billions spent on Year 2000 repairs, if not damages from breakdowns
in the future. But lawyers say the actual insurance policy at issue
may not cover the crucial years in the underlying suit against
Cincinnati Insurance's client. That wrinkle, they say, could let
the insurer off the hook without the court's shedding light on the
larger issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results in the initial cases have dampened the fervor
somewhat,'' said Charles Kerr, a New York lawyer who heads the Year
2000 section of the Practicing Law Institute, a legal education
group. ``Legislation could change the landscape dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Many lawyers say the momentum for some kind of action in
Congress looks unstoppable. Seven states have already barred Year
2000 damage suits against themselves and similar proposals were
filed in 30 other legislatures this year. Some states have already
passed bills limiting private lawsuits as well. A recent example,
signed last Tuesday in Colorado, gives businesses that attempt to
address their Year 2000 risks stronger defenses against lawsuits;
it also bans punitive damages as a remedy in such litigation. &QL;

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
[HEAD RETURN TO GERMANY IS POIGNANT JOURNEY FOR WORLD WAR II
VETERAN After D-Day, Ben's 80th Infantry made its way inland.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike's unit went west to Cherbourg. The deep channel port was
vital for the Allied advance. The fighting raged three weeks before
Patton broke through June 27.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Alvarado was shot Sept. 27 during night fighting near St.
Genevieve. He spent the rest of 1944 in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Mike found himself surrounded in Bastogne during the Battle of
the Bulge. Americans fought off repeated German attempts to take
the city.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Mike, barely old enough to drive, decided he'd had
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just sat down and said he couldn't fight no more,'' Ben
Alvarado said.
</P>
<P>
   About that same time, Ben Alvarado rejoined the 80th Infantry,
which later that spring would cross the Rhine River and push into
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   On April 12, 1945, the 80th arrived on hills above Weimar. Ben
Alvarado was in a nearby town guarding prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The American commander, Col. N.O. Costello, knew that surrender
talks had begun and that the war would soon be over.
</P>
<P>
   He decided to give Weimar a chance to save itself. But the
Buchenwald concentration camp was nearby, and he knew SS troops
were in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Costello summoned a burgermeister from another town and gave the
man an ultimatum to deliver by bicycle to the Weimar mayor. If the
town would fly a white flag, the American guns would spare the
city.
</P>
<P>
   The burgermeister roused the town's mayor from bed.
</P>
<P>
   A town meeting was convened as American tanks and artillery sat
poised above. SS soldiers argued against surrender, saying Hitler
wouldn't approve.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans were hoping the city would go for the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was spring,'' remembered Richard Bobb, now 80, of Ormond
Beach, Fla. ``The trees were blooming and the birds were singing.
We didn't want to fight anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   That evening, a white flag was hoisted. The SS troops fled into
the woods shortly before American jeeps rolled into town.
Last week in their kitchen, Victoria Alvarado tried to help her
husband make sense of the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about winners and losers or conquerors and heroes.
This is about surviving,'' she told him.
</P>
<P>
   Think about the German children and their children who came from
those who were there that day, she said. That's what these people
are talking about. Many of them may never have been born if the
town meeting had turned out differently.
</P>
<P>
   Ben knew she was right.
</P>
<P>
   So he went to Weimar, and this week will visit those who
remember that day. He will talk to children who, as his wife said,
may never have been born.
</P>
<P>
   And he will think of his brother.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Ben had tried to get Mike to talk about the war.
What had he seen so terrible at Cherbourg and Bastogne to render
him a shell of the young man who would jump, jive and wail to Benny
Goodman?
</P>
<P>
   Mike never answered. Maybe he didn't remember.
</P>
<P>
   There were times when Ben caught Mike singing, in a near
whisper, a song from the days before the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``His voice was weak and would break,'' Ben remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Alvarado died of a heart attack on a summer day in 1989 in
Ben's back yard. Ben found him, a leaf rake clutched in his
brother's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Ben often wondered why he was able to come home, get married,
work and raise a family while his brother never stopped hearing the
bombs of Cherbourg and would sing the old songs in a broken voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the difference was that I ignored it. ... I refused to
believe it was real,'' Ben said. ``Mike couldn't do that. He was
too young. It was too real for him.''

 2ND TAKE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT CAMPBELL and CHRISTINE VENDEL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Beach's neighborhood, people sit on their front porches on
warm evenings. The street he lived on is secluded, but the lights
and sounds of the Westport area _ bustling bars, packed restaurants
and live music _ are in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the residents are renters, and their houses are being
bought up by a subsidiary of DST Systems Inc. for redevelopment.
Residents in these single-story and two-story frame homes include
waitresses, children who ride bicycles, young musicians and a few
partyers. Beach and Davis were limousine drivers who took
passengers to and from the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Heidi Phillips, lead singer of the band Frogpond, recalled
residents barricading the one-way street for a block party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd play on someone's porch to entertain everyone,'' she
said. Now she can't imagine something like that happening. Phillips
spent the night at a friend's home after hearing news of the
killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was creepy,'' she said. ``The vibe on the street was too
weird. I've never been that close to something that weird.''
</P>
<P>
   To Brian Miller, who moved in down the block about a year ago,
the street used to be unnoticed. But the killings have brought
gawkers and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, nobody knew this street was here,'' he said.
`` Now everybody does.''
</P>
<P>
   The killings also have affected waitresses at nearby Nichols
Lunch, where Beach, Davis and Nickerson frequently dined. The
waitresses shook their heads in amazement one day last week while
swapping stories about having served Beach many meals.
</P>
<P>
   Tears welling in her eyes, Angelina Wood bragged about the
kindness Beach, Davis and Nickerson showed her one Christmas,
giving her a Chiefs pin as a gift. They knew she collected pins and
wanted to thank her for her service.
</P>
<P>
   For years Beach had come in virtually every day, often for more
than one meal a day. Davis called him ``Dad,'' and Beach would
always pay for his stepson's meals, they remembered. Police who
searched the Beach house and a cleanup team that later disinfected
it reported an unforgettable scene:
</P>
<P>
   There was virtually no furniture. A couch and easy chair
apparently served as beds. Several cats lived in the house, which
reeked of cat waste.
</P>
<P>
   Police discovered a dozen or more stick-on air fresheners
throughout the house and a window-unit air conditioner turned on
high. They were not enough to mask the odor left by the cats and
the killings.
</P>
<P>
   After the bodies were removed, the blood remained.
</P>
<P>
   Cobwebs and dust blanketed shelves and walls. Shredded remnants
of drapes were strung across some windows. A back-door window was
covered by a white terry-cloth towel.
</P>
<P>
   There were no lamps. The rooms were lighted by bare light bulbs
in ceiling fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   The living area had stereos, televisions and a VCR containing
the rental movie ``Pleasantville.''
</P>
<P>
   Several plastic model cars and trucks and numerous wall posters
of military aircraft also were found. Wall-mounted display cases
held dozens of Matchbox cars. A laminated map of Kansas City _
useful for livery drivers _ was tacked to a wall.
</P>
<P>
   There was no kitchen table. Conveniences for everyday living
were missing. The sinks were rusted and piled with rusted pans. The
refrigerator was not running. The stove was crusted and inoperable.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning the house was a task that fell to Don McNulty and Shawn
Bayouth of Bio Cleaning Services of America, which specializes in
cleaning crime scenes. The house, protected by plastic and duct
tape, was worked on by the men for seven hours Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two days, families of the five victims said their
final goodbyes.
</P>
<P>
   At Nativity of Mary Catholic Church in Independence, Mo., on
Saturday, Beach's ex-wife, Erika Bauer, and her other children
mourned the loss of Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Their faces bathed in tears, their bodies racked with sobs, they
remembered their son and brother by his affectionate nickname,
``Mikey,'' and recalled his loving attention to those around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gather today with broken hearts and angry hearts,'' said
the Rev. Bob Rost. ``...Whenever we face death or violence, we know
that God has already faced this personally and God is always with
us. ... Precious Lord, we ask you to take Mikey's hand and lead him
home. Take our hands, too. We need you to give us strength and to
heal the wounds we cannot heal.''

<P>
   Kansas City, Mo. _ It started with two homicides on a Sunday two
weeks ago. The body count grew and eight days passed before anyone
outside the tiny corner house realized that something was terribly
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, five men were discovered dead inside Gary Beach's
rented home in the Westport area of Kansas City. Each of the
victims had been shot and left where he fell in the home. With
rooms barely 11 feet square, it became impossible for anyone inside
to move about without stepping over bodies.
</P>
<P>
   One was in the middle of the kitchen floor. One was slumped on
the couch. One blocked the doorway to the bathroom. Two lay on the
steps to the basement.
</P>
<P>
   Even with victims scattered about the house, neighbors say,
Beach came and went as he always had.
</P>
<P>
   Today he is in jail, charged in one homicide and a suspect in
the four others. He knew all of the victims: Kenneth H. Gulley Jr.,
45, stepson of Beach's brother; Michael Davis, 32, Beach's stepson,
who lived in the house; Mark Nelson, 28, who also lived at the
house; Christopher G. Conrad, 27, who knew Beach through Nelson;
and Jerry Nickerson, 56, a longtime friend of Beach's.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated requests, The Kansas City Star has been unable
to talk to Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the investigation say police think they have
pieced together a chronology of the killings.
</P>
<P>
   The first two victims, Nelson and Davis, were killed March 28.
Both were shot with a .25-caliber pistol. Nelson also had been
beaten on the head with a hammer and Davis had been suffocated.
Nelson was found in the bathroom and Davis on the basement steps.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining victims were killed with a 9mm handgun. Conrad was
killed on the basement steps and Nickerson in the kitchen. Gulley
was killed April 1. He died on a couch in the front room. Neighbors
later recalled hearing gunshots that morning but had no idea what
was going on inside the house.
</P>
<P>
   They notified two Kansas City police officers who were parked
along Jefferson on an unrelated call. The officers left without
investigating. Police are trying to determine what might have
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say police think that Conrad was the principal target of
a murder plot and that the others were killed for various reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The mass murder disturbed even veteran homicide officers, who
deal with death on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most emotionally disturbing scenes I've ever
seen,'' said homicide Detective Ron Russell, a 29-year-veteran.
``It was eerie.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a typical homicide involved one body and four or five
relatives. This case involved five bodies and more than 40
relatives. Police briefed the relatives as a group Wednesday night
about the status of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You begin to feel everyone's pain,'' Russell said. ``It starts
to wear on you emotionally as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Beach became a suspect Monday after Gulley's relatives drew
attention to the Jefferson Street house. Gulley had told them he
was planning to go out with Beach after work in North Kansas City
about 12:30 a.m. April 1. When he failed to return later that day
or the next, the relatives became worried.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives followed up with North Kansas City police early
Monday and persuaded Detective Rick Landon and Detective Duane
Hostikka to check Beach's house. Gulley's brother, Dennis, and
other relatives followed the officers.
</P>
<P>
   The detectives said they had no authority to enter the house.
They radioed Kansas City police and left.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives stayed, and moments later a couple of them kicked
in the rear door. Once inside, Dennis Gulley noticed a pile of
blankets on the basement steps. Lifting them, he found one of the
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City police soon arrived and found distraught members of
the Gulley family in front of the house. Within 24 hours, police
had arrested Beach in the parking lot of a hotel near his house.
He's charged with Gulley's death and has pleaded not guilty. Police
are investigating the four other deaths. &QL;

`A PRAYER FOR THE DYING:'   A GODLY MAN CALLED JACOB, IN A PLAGUE'S
CRUCIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The terrifying compression of Stewart O'Nan's novella of
mortality triggers a synapse of memory: the lines by the
Elizabethan poet Thomas Nashe:
</P>
<P>
   The plague full swift goes by;
</P>
<P>
   I am sick, I must dye ...
</P>
<P>
   ``A Prayer for the Dying'' uses different lines for its
epigraph, from Albert Camus: ``There is no escape in a time of
plague. We must choose to either love or to hate God.'' It
accomplishes a closer thematic job; it does not come as close as
Nashe to suggesting the cold bronze hammer-blows of O'Nan's
writing.
</P>
<P>
   It must seem like critical hypertrophy _ quibbling with the
epigraph for goodness' sake _ but there is a point. As parables
should and rarely do, O'Nan's plague story has so much that is
implicit and hollowed out, so much emptiness between the sentences,
that the reader is called upon to enter, invent and rearrange. A
parable is a vacuum that sucks you in. Only great artfulness
manages the seal. O'Nan, a young writer of unusual range and
variety, is a master of voices and the place they resonate from, of
human rhythms and the universal rhythms they cut across.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Prayer for the Dying'' uses the Wisconsin countryside of the
late 1860s for its setting instead of Camus' Oran, and diphtheria
instead of bubonic plague. (``Prayer,'' in the metaphysical anguish
that hovers through its particular agony, is of course a grandchild
of ``The Plague.'' I take leave of the comparison: Grandchildren
get to be considered for themselves.)
</P>
<P>
   The mines around the town of Friendship are played out; heat
sears and bleaches the land, and ragged Civil War veterans still
straggle through. The conflict's horrors shadow the book. They
obsess Jacob, the driven narrator, who saw his companions starve
and go mad in the course of a long siege between the armies.
Throughout Friendship's destruction by diphtheria, fear and then
fire, it is as if the war, having died out, had come back as a
ghost, to punish.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, at the start, Jacob's voice is fresh and redolent:
</P>
<P>
   ``High summer and Friendship's quiet. The men tend the
shimmering fields. Children tramp the woods, wade the creeks, sound
the cool ponds. ... The only sound's the freight drumming through
to the south, tossing its plume of cinders above the treetops, the
trucks clicking a mile off. Then quiet, the buzz of insects, the
breathless afternoon. Cows twitch and flick.
</P>
<P>
   ``You like it like this, the bright, languid days.''
</P>
<P>
   Note the ``you.'' As the story spins down its vortex, the
pronoun acquires meaning. Jacob, who tries desperately to maintain
hope and faith and finally loses, cannot bear his own ``I'' and
lays it aside. (Conceive Job punished so far as to have to think of
himself in the second person.) Even before we notice this, we sense
doom in Jacob's initially exuberant account. He is, he tells us,
the town sheriff. He is the minister. He is the undertaker.
</P>
<P>
   This wacky accumulation expresses his obsession: Out of the
destruction of the war, when God seemed to have vanished, Jacob is
determined to reinvent Him. He cares for his town as God is
supposed to care for the world: He punishes transgressions,
provides faith for the living and passage for the dead. ``Credo
quia absurdum'' _ the classic religious formula of, roughly, ``I
believe even to absurdity'' _ becomes, as horrors multiply, its own
horror: I believe right on into madness.
</P>
<P>
   With a shivery economy of means and a dreadful lavishness of
effect, O'Nan advances the horror on parallel tracks, the growth of
the epidemic and the disintegration of Jacob. The former begins
with the discovery of a dead soldier, then a maddened cow, then the
awful suicide _ throats burned through with poison _ of the cow's
owners. Deaths occur one by one, then by clusters, as the bell
ringer works to exhaustion tolling the age of each of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor makes his rounds and Jacob goes with him; at first as
undertaker and then, as the corpses mount, as sheriff. He puts up
quarantine signs, bolts a rebellious woman into her house, burns
down the house of a dead man, noticing too late an old woman's
desperate face at an upper window. With the sheriff of the next
town he enforces the quarantine at the town line. Surreally, a
circus parade arrives, mechanically tootling, and the elephant in a
dust cloud. As the wagons are turned, one by one, Jacob braces
himself for the drivers to protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of them do, except the elephant, who leaves a single
cannonball of a dropping as he swings around; it raises a puff of
dust, then sits there like an insult as the tinny music fades.''
</P>
<P>
   The scenes grow more terrible. Townspeople rebel, try to break
through by force. There are shootings and an ending, produced by a
forest fire that engulfs the town, like the Apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   More affecting and harsher than all of this is Jacob's own
pulling apart. He cannot bear his degrading, the process by which
he must give up the sacramental care he brings to the dead as
undertaker and his pastoral care for the living. Only the sheriff
remains in him, enforcing an increasingly mad notion of order and
belief.
</P>
<P>
   Amelia, his baby daughter, dies, and then Marta, his wife. (She
coughs at breakfast; pink spots flower suddenly in the milk jug.)
He sits them in chairs, embalmed, chats with them in the evenings,
bathes Marta and in despairing denial, makes love to her. A sample
of the Bosch-like domestic scene:
</P>
<P>
   ``After dinner Marta plays the melodeon and the two of you sing.
She falls off the stool but you prop her up, set her feet on the
pedals, her fingers on the keys, help her find middle C. `Jesus Our
Redeemer. He Will Come in Glory for Me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yet O'Nan has much more in mind than twin horrors, external and
interior. If Jacob, trying to be the God of love, becomes the God
of retribution, the spiral does not stop there. His madness is not
all of him; there is a bleak awareness at the same time, and this
is what makes ``A Prayer'' more than a brilliant exercise of
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Clinging to his faith, Jacob disputes it as well. Here is one of
his tortured arguments with himself:
</P>
<P>
   `` `It's not right,' you say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you angry with?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not God
</P>
<P>
   ``No? Who else is there? Is this the devil's work?
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be, you think, but uncertainly.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the problem of belief: how to reconcile God with evil.
O'Nan carries it further. In Jacob he has the believer, torn. He
has God, as well: struggling in despair with the same problem.

 &HT;    WORLD COMMUNITY BEGINS BUILDING ITS CASE TO PROSECUTE SERB
ATROCITIES

   STANKOVAC REFUGEE CAMP, Macedonia In a quiet corner of this
sprawling tent city, a sad and exhausted man from Pristina told
international observers of the horror he witnessed the day Serbian
forces emptied the capital of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing to his parents' home as Serb police and masked
paramilitary gunmen began their brutal sweep of the city on April
1, the young man said he found eight lifeless bodies in one room.
Among the freshly bloodied corpses was his mother, who had been
shot twice in the back of the head. His father was missing and
dead, too, he presumed.
</P>
<P>
   The man, whose name was withheld by international authorities
here to protect his identity, wants justice.
</P>
<P>
   So does much of the world.
</P>
<P>
   With the aim of supplying a case for the international war
crimes tribunal, United Nations officials and other international
monitors at refugee camps in Macedonia and Albania are recording
eyewitness testimony from among the some 600,000 refugees forced
from Kosovo, the ethnic Albanian province in Yugoslavia besieged by
Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Observers of the 55-nation Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), who until late March sought to
monitor a cease-fire in Kosovo, have in the past week collected
testimony from hundreds of refugees in the budding effort to
prepare war crimes indictments.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any criminal case, the sooner you can get hold of the
evidence and take down those stories, the better,'' said Sandy
Blyth, spokesman for the OSCE monitors in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The detective work, slowly being organized by the United
Nations, the OSCE and non-profit agencies, will be turned over to
the war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials, seeking to bolster domestic and international
support for NATO's continuing air war against Yugoslavia, have
accused Serb authorities of mass executions, at least one mass rape
of young women at a Serb army camp near Dakovica and the pillage of
scores of cities and towns. Last week, the Pentagon announced the
names of nine Yugoslav commanders put on notice that their actions
are being closely monitored by the West.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen surmised Sunday on ABC's ``This
Week'' that ``we are going to find more and more evidence of mass
graves, mass executions, some pretty horrific stories.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no way independently to verify the accounts of killings
and other atrocities because most international aid workers and
foreign journalists have been expelled from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The task of investigators inside the refugee camps is enormous
and painstakingly slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``In two weeks of interviewing, I've only found a handful of
eyewitnesses to killings and from our point of view only one
witness is not good enough,'' said Ben Ward, a war crimes
researcher for Human Rights Watch, a private group that monitors
human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Ward is concentrating on reports of the methodical destruction
March 28-30 of the town of Vucitrn (CQ), north of Pristina. He
needs 10 to 12 independent eyewitness accounts to make a solid
case, and so far has only two.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the first step is simply to catalog the
testimony of refugees and then cull the most dependable stories for
further examination and verification.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence also is being collected from sophisticated U.S. spy
satellites, aerial reconnaissance and sporadic contacts via mobile
and satellite telephone connections to residents still in Kosovo.
However, those contacts are becoming rarer, officials conceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best evidence is going there and seeing it with our own
eyes,'' said Sheri Fink (CQ) of Physicians for Human Rights, an
independent aid organization. ``It is frustrating that we don't
know and can't say yet what is going on in Kosovo. There may be no
one left there to tell the stories.''
</P>
<P>
   From descriptions by refugees crossing into Albania and
Macedonia, the worst atrocities appeared to have occurred in the
western areas of Kosovo near the border with Albania, where
fighting had been heaviest between Serb forces and the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgium on Sunday, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea showed aerial
photographs of the village of Pusto Selo, southwest of Pristina,
that appeared to be freshly turned soil at a site that looked
``somewhat similar'' to aerial shots of mass graves seen during the
war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators in Macedonia said the prosecution of leading
Serb figures, including Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
could be hindered by the fact that the Kosovo atrocities appear to
have been random, varying from village to village or even from
block to block in the same town, and not a consistent blitz applied
to all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the villages were being cleared was systematic, but
not the atrocities,'' said an OSCE field worker at the Stankovac
refugee camp north of the Macedonian capital, Skopje. ``Those seem
to have been left to the discretion of the individual commanders
and vary from house to house and street to street.''
</P>
<P>
   Many refugees report that they could not positively identify the
police or paramilitary forces who committed killings and torched
houses because they wore masks. However, investigators are
soliciting other identifying details from eyewitnesses, such as
markings on military vehicles and troop uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Recording the eyewitness testimony _ and doing it soon _ is
crucial. Aid workers in the camps are overwhelmed trying to cope
with the basic needs of the refugees and there are too few
investigators, officials agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is wasting,'' said Fink. ``Memories fade and dead bodies
decay.''

SPRINT CHIEF IS COMPENSATION KING, BUT IS HE WORTH IT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call him the $280 million man.
</P>
<P>
   That's the windfall _ so far _ that Sprint Corp. Chief Executive
Officer William T. Esrey stands to collect when he cashes in the
gargantuan stock option grants he has received in the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Forget his salary and bonus. Options alone have earned him the
equivalent of $2.7 million a week, $538,000 per workday, or $67,000
an hour, as of the close of business Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it took Esrey 47 minutes to earn what an average
Kansas City, Mo., family took home during all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey didn't care to comment on his stock options, which make
him the undisputed compensation king of Kansas City and one of the
best-paid chief executives in the country, if not worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The company response, however, echoes others caught up in the
national debate about the widening wage gap between executives and
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Namely, not every Walter Mitty out there can run a Fortune 500
company, much less generate Sprint's market-beating returns.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: In four years, Sprint has built the nation's
fastest-growing wireless phone company from scratch. Its flagship
long-distance division is beating competitors handily. And the
company is one of the most talked-about takeover targets in the
telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line? Sprint shareholders have doubled their money in the
past year alone.
</P>
<P>
   So who's arguing with a few hundred million for the man in the
baronial corner office?
</P>
<P>
   Union members, for one, are wondering how one man can reap such
a bonanza when thousands who toil in the company trenches are
seeing their relatively measly base salaries frozen or increased by
3 or 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even some Sprint shareholders are scratching their heads,
wondering about the propriety of such eye-popping pay. The company
has even attracted its own gadfly, George Speight, who annually
proposes resolutions at the company's shareholders meeting to limit
the packages.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the issue raises the question: Is Esrey _ or any
other master of the universe _ worth that much money? Some
independent experts doubt it.
</P>
<P>
   They also wonder whether Sprint's board has simply given Esrey
an enormous golden parachute if or when he sells the company.
According to executive headhunters, the pool of managers with the
proven ability to run a Fortune 500 company is minuscule.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're hot commodities that are hard to attract,'' said
Spencer Fields, a principal at William M. Mercer Inc. ``The chief
executives understand what they're worth, and the boards are forced
to acknowledge that with competitive pay packages.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock options are essentially a promise from the company to sell
a given number of shares at a fixed price for a specified period of
time. If the market price goes up after the grant, the option
holder can exercise the option, buy the shares at the old price,
then sell them at a profit.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale behind megagrants is simple: If chief executives
can jump-start a company's performance and generate high returns
for shareholders, then they deserve to share the swag.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with large salaries and bonuses, options are relatively
inexpensive for the company in terms of immediate cash outlays, and
are often rewarded in lieu of cash pay.
</P>
<P>
   Option plans also can be structured to tie the executive to the
company for the life of the option and often contain specific,
measurable performance criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, if the company underperforms, top officers feel
shareholders' pain, most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   That win-win reasoning is seen as sound corporate governance by
hundreds of companies, including the board of directors at Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   According to the company's proxy report to shareholders, the
board tries to link executive pay to the short- and long-term
performance of the company ``so as to maximize shareholder value.''
</P>
<P>
   Esrey can't cash in all his chips until 2002, unless someone
buys the company and accelerates the vesting schedule of his
options. Until then, he has to keep Sprint's stock levitating at
current levels or risk seeing his pot of gold shrink considerably.
</P>
<P>
   If the bull market continues, however, Esrey's financial picture
gets even rosier.
</P>
<P>
   None of the members of the board of directors' executive
compensation committee were available to comment on the specifics
of his compensation. Nor were subordinates willing to comment on
the boss's pay.
</P>
<P>
   The company did, however, release a statement saying,
``Shareholders consider his leadership critical to the steady
upward trend of the company's ... stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement also referred to the results of a recent Fortune
magazine survey that ranked Sprint as the most admired
telecommunications company _ ``results of his leadership and his
vision put into action.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's policy is to compare top officers' pay with that of
leaders at similar-size companies. The company tries to put total
compensation at the 75th percentile of those surveyed _ if
performance goals are met.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Sprint was ranked No. 88 in the Fortune 500 revenue
ranking. Esrey, however, ranked 16th in terms of the number of
options granted to Fortune 500 executives in 1997, according to
Executive Compensation Advisory Services.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by USA Today ranked Esrey's 1998 pay package _
$148.8 million, according to their calculations _ as the
10th-highest among 469 companies that had reported their executive
pay so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Esrey's compensation is definitely up there, but we see so
many of these that I can't say that it's overwhelmingly large,''
said Emily Zasada, senior project manager at Executive
Compensation, which tracks compensation at more than 1,000 public
companies. ``There's other executives who are within that
ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Disney's Michael Eisner, who exercised options valued at
more than $570 million in 1998. Or Jack Welch, the chief at General
Electric, who exercised $46 million in options and is sitting on an
additional $290 million in unexercised grants.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, consider what Sprint delivered to its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The company's regular stock, which tracks Sprint's local,
long-distance and directory publishing businesses, is up 83 percent
in the past year. The company also issued each shareholder a half
share of Sprint PCS stock for each regular share owned. Sprint PCS
stock is now worth $57 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Add in regular dividends, and Sprint is up almost 110 percent in
the past year, almost seven times the market as measured by the
surging Dow Jones industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   If Sprint's largest shareholders _ mostly mutual and pension
funds _ are worried about Esrey's megagrants, which are big enough
to dilute earnings slightly, they aren't complaining.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to see why. Sprint's high-octane performance has
created about $31 billion in shareholder wealth in the past year
alone, of which Esrey is on track to take home a little less than 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Said Tony Ferrugia, a former Sprint employee who is now an
industry analyst with A.G. Edwards in St. Louis: ``If he could go
out and double my money again next year, I'd give him another 1
percent. Wouldn't you?''
According to industry studies, stock options now make up two-thirds
of a chief executive's pay. As the stock market has soared, those
executives have reaped enormous gains.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts contend that many chief executives are simply
riding the roaring bull market to mammoth paydays. With the size of
today's grants, a small uptick in stock price can produce a
windfall for the option holder.
</P>
<P>
   Many corporate chiefs also are allowed to eat their dessert
early, then go back for more. It's called a reload, or restoration
option, and allows an executive to capture any market gains in a
stock by exercising options he owns. The options are then replaced
at the new market price so any future gains also can be captured.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey exercised options on 433,580 shares of Sprint and 216,792
shares of Sprint PCS in 1998, realizing $20 million in value. In
both cases, more than half of those options were reloaded, and
Esrey has already seen an additional $17.2 million in unrealized
gains on the underlying shares.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of double-dipping rankles the rank and file, who see a
widening gap between the average worker and the occupants of the
corner offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most employees at Sprint are aware of Mr. Esrey's pay package,
and it doesn't sit well with them,'' said John Howard, an assistant
vice president at the Communications Workers of America, which
represents about 4,500 Sprint employees in 15 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go to local union meetings, I hear about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaints have been louder this year, as Sprint is freezing
base pay for some staff and imposing an incentive compensation plan
that includes disciplinary actions _ including firing _ for those
who don't meet sales targets, union members said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the kingpin, the main man,'' said Jim Brimer, a spokesman
for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which
represents 5,000 Sprint workers. ``And there's no question that
Sprint is a well-oiled machine that is churning out profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's got an entire organization behind him. Don't those
workers deserve to share in the rewards as well? This sounds like
`Sacrifice the workers, and give everything to me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Brimer is a shareholder and says he's ``tickled to death'' at
what has happened to Sprint stock. He concedes that Esrey should be
handsomely rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's reached the level of being ridiculous,'' he said.
``He's not worth that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Some compensation experts agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was grossly overpaid,'' said Graef Crystal, a professor at
the University of California-Berkeley and the editor of
crystalreport.com, an online newsletter on executive compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal uses a common but complicated mathematical formula known
as the Black and Scholes Model to value and compare executives'
stock options packages.
</P>
<P>
   Using that model, Crystal valued Esrey's 1997 pay package _
comprising base pay, bonus, incentive pay and options _ at $38.3
million.
</P>
<P>
   The package actually was worth far more because of Sprint's
subsequent share price appreciation. But using the more
conservative number, Crystal figured that Esrey's pay was 384
percent of the average chief executive's at a similar-size company
that generated similar performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 3 percent of chief executives among the 1,568 public
companies I surveyed were more overpaid than he was,'' Crystal
said.
</P>
<P>
   To calculate its own value of Esrey's 1997 option package, the
AFL-CIO simply picked the figures from the company's proxy report
and calculated that Esrey earned $76 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at it that way, the union figured it would take a
minimum-wage worker 7,142 years to earn the equivalent of Esrey's
1997 pay package.
</P>
<P>
   If the worker started today, he'd be finished by the year 9141.

   NEW YORK _ Out of the tombs of pharaohs and the highest
officials of ancient Egypt come more than 200 objects reunited for
the first time since they were excavated in the mid-19th century.
Dating from 3110 B.C. to 2258 B.C., these statues, bas-reliefs,
painted decors and items of jewelry have been assembled at the
Grand Palais in Paris in ``Egyptian Art at the Time of the
Pyramids.'' The exhibition closes on July 12 and will be seen from
Sept. 16 through Jan. 9 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in
Manhattan. Information: 011-33-1-44-13-17-17.

ORAL TRADITIONS CONVERGE AS POETS GO OUT FOR A DRINK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mont., Mass., Puerto Rico, Brazil)   By KATHRYN SHATTUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was billed as ``a populist bacchanal'' and was
offered with a verse of advice plucked from T.S. Eliot: ``O, do not
ask what is it/Let us go and make our visit.''
</P>
<P>
   So they converged on Manhattan last weekend _ the poets, the
poetry lovers and the simply curious _ to travel in the footsteps
of Walt Whitman, Dylan Thomas, Allen Ginsberg, E.E. Cummings and
Edgar Allan Poe at the first People's Poetry Gathering. Presented
by City Lore, a New York cultural organization, and Poets House, a
literary center with a 35,000-volume poetry library, the three-day
festival took its cue from the Greek epic and explored two themes,
``Masters of Oral Tradition'' and ``Emerging Forms and Formats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The term `spoken word' is very popular right now, but we
forget that poetry began with words spoken out loud,'' said Steve
Zeitlin, the event's co-director with Lee Briccetti. ``The
gathering is the first festival that highlights the oral roots of
poetry. We're recognizing that poetry happens every day and
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   With headquarters at Cooper Union, the festival took
participants on a walking tour of some of the locations in lower
Manhattan that have nurtured the city's poetic activity for nearly
two centuries, from Washington Square Park to the White Horse
Tavern to St. Mark's Church and the American Indian Community
House.
</P>
<P>
   The 50 poets on hand guaranteed that there was someone to suit
almost every literary taste. Some wielded grand titles, like Robert
Pinsky, the U.S. Poet Laureate; others, grand traditions, like Jose
Joao dos Santos, a Brazilian who accompanied himself on a 12-string
guitar while singing of President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky and
mermaids at the bottom of the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Some gleaned inspiration from their occupations, like the cowboy
poet Wallace MacRae, a rancher in Montana who wrote about saving
his land from the coal-mining industry. Still others took delight
in the unknown, like the Puerto Rican decima poets who improvised a
10-line song from a verse picked from a hat and the free-style
poets who rapped on topics sometimes unmentionable.
</P>
<P>
   True to its billing, the festival merged serious thought, joyful
abandon and a touch of debauchery. The events ranged from the staid
to the extreme, from a joint reading by Pinksy and Robert Bly, the
author of ``Iron John,'' to a midnight orgy of erotic poetry
featuring Penny Arcade, Anselm Berrigan, Max Blagg, Lee Ann Brown,
Sharon Mesmer and Edwin Torres. A ``Literary Pub Crawl'' featured
readings in some of the Greenwich Village bars that have been homes
away from home for poets.
</P>
<P>
   During the days the poets discussed topics like democracy,
education and feminism and paid homage to Pablo Neruda, Rudyard
Kipling and Federico Garcia Lorca; in the evenings they tried their
hands at performing. Don Edwards sang of rodeos and cattle drives
and riding the range; the hobo U. Utah Phillips joined the
folk-punk rocker Ani DiFranco in a sentimental ode to life on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   At a Talking Book Festival on Friday night at Irving Plaza, the
American Indian poet Sherman Alexie, the urban poet Sekou Sundiata
with his Eclectic Poetic collective, and Jerome Rothenberg, ``the
poet laureate of the underground,'' whispered, chanted and
sometimes screamed their words in time to the wail of backup bands.
Between sets the master of ceremonies, Bob Holman, shouted to the
audience, ``Go write your own poems!''
</P>
<P>
   Competition was rife. There were slams among teen-agers, slams
between the Nuyorican poets and the cowboys and hobos, slams
featuring the unlikely form of haiku. A ``New York Heavyweight
Bout'' on Saturday pitted the defending champion, Alexie, against
Patricia Smith, a former Boston Globe columnist and four-time
national poetry slam winner, in a verbal boxing match.
Neck-and-neck with Ms. Smith, Alexie produced these lines, based on
his random selection of ``the grotto'' in the final,
improvisational round to secure his title:
</P>
<P>
   Praise the soprano that gave birth to me
</P>
<P>
   Praise the vibrato of the first cry
</P>
<P>
   Praise the paper-thin lungs burned in the heat of my arrival
</P>
<P>
   Praise the vibrato of the heart-and-lung machine
</P>
<P>
   Praise my enemies lest they defeat me.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith bowed in admiration as the crowd stood and roared.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the weighty credentials and the achievement awards and
the best-seller lists and the movie deals. Maybe the cheering is
what a poet really wants after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``My deepest ambition as a poet is to become and be a people's
poet,'' said Pulitzer Prize winner Galway Kinnell, who defined his
style as academic and less often spoken aloud. ``All poetry is
one,'' he said. ``One person telling others what it is for me to be
alive, here and now. And whatever it means, good.''

<P>
   BRUSSELS _ A Russian relief convoy headed for Yugoslavia was
stopped by Hungarian authorities Sunday after they determined it
was carrying fuel and equipment that could be used by Belgrade's
military, NATO officials reported.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, which occurred as the convoy was trying to cross
into Hungary from Ukraine, is the latest irritant in the rapidly
deteriorating relationship between Russia and the Western alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials charged the alliance was harassing its relief
efforts. NATO officials insisted, however, that the alliance was
strictly enforcing the U.N. Security Council embargo on military
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO members are not blocking humanitarian aid but trying to
filter out those elements that could have a military use,'' NATO
spokesman Jamie Shea said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Western relations with Russia have been severely strained by the
conflict in Kosovo. While Russian officials say they have been
frustrated by President Slobodan Milosevic's refusal to work out a
peace settlement for Kosovo, Moscow staked its prestige on averting
military action.
</P>
<P>
   Now that NATO has begun bombing, Russian President Boris Yeltsin
has drawn a new line in the sand: stopping a ground invasion that
NATO says it does not now plan to launch but which has been
prepared by the Western alliance as a contingency.
</P>
<P>
   But with his political standing and physical stamina waning,
Yeltsin's comments seemed largely intended for a domestic audience.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his views remain of concern to the Western alliance,
which would like Russia to be part of an eventual autonomy
agreement for Kosovo and even contribute troops to an international
force that would police the accord. In an effort to achieve that
goal, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright plans to meet in Oslo,
Norway, on Tuesday with the Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   The downturn in Russian-NATO relations is also a concern to
Western military officials, who worry that Russia may provide
intelligence to Belgrade or dispatch military advisers or arms
there.
</P>
<P>
   One focus of concern is a Russian intelligence ship, the Liman,
which is now in the Adriatic Sea. It has positioned itself near the
U.S. aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt and appears to be trying
to count the planes taking off from the carrier, among other
things, according to a Pentagon official.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Foreign Ministry, for its part, says the information
gathered by the ship is being transmitted to Moscow. But the
Foreign Ministry has not said how the information will be used or
whether it will be shared later with other nations friendly to
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, however, has not abandoned all cooperation with NATO.
More than 1,000 Russian peacekeeping troops are still deployed in
Bosnia. They are not formally under NATO command but report to Gen.
Wesley K. Clark, the supreme commander of NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sunday's confrontation over the Russian convoy epitomized
the sharp downturn in relations.
</P>
<P>
   The episode began when a convoy of 73 trucks carrying supplies
from Russia and Belarus was stopped at the border of Ukraine and
Hungary, which is one of NATO's newest members.
</P>
<P>
   The convoy carried food, medicine and toys for children. Russian
officials said they had hoped the convoy would reach Yugoslavia in
time for Orthodox Christian Easter celebrations on Sunday. The
convoy also included eight fuel tankers, which Russian officials
insisted were carrying gasoline for the relief convoy.
</P>
<P>
   Hungarian authorities, however, insisted the fuel tankers could
be used by the Yugoslav military and refused to allow them to pass.
A major aim of the allied bombing campaign has been to destroy fuel
supplies for the Serbian military.
</P>
<P>
   Hungarian authorities also refused to allow the armored vehicles
and armored Kamaz trucks to cross the border. At NATO headquarters,
Shea insisted that the Hungarians were simply trying vigorously to
enforce the U.S. arms embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday evening, Russia said it hoped to work out an arrangement
so that the supplies could proceed on civilian trucks. Money, they
said, will be sent so that fuel can be purchased in Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regard any stalling of the humanitarian cargo as an attempt
to block its passage,'' the Russian Foreign Ministry said.

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO issued an aerial photograph on Sunday
of what officials said could be ``possible mass graves'' of ethnic
Albanian villagers killed by Serb forces inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph, taken on Friday over Pusto Selo, near Orahovac,
showed what appeared to be two long parallel lines of mounds in a
clearing off a road with buildings scattered nearby and tracks in
the ground that could have been left by military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The freshly turned earth could indicate possible mass
graves,'' said Col. Konrad Freytag, a spokesman for the allied
military command.
</P>
<P>
   While he emphasized that the existence of a mass grave could
only be confirmed if independent observers eventually got in on the
ground, the photograph provided the first evidence other than
accounts from refugees of atrocities taking place in Kosovo since
journalists and foreign observers were expelled or evacuated from
the province last month.
</P>
<P>
   Freytag said the weather forced cancellation of some bombing
missions Saturday night and early Sunday, and the command reported
no successful attacks during that period against Serbian forces or
tanks operating in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance spokesman Jamie Shea, perhaps just putting the best
face on the situation, said: ``Last night, NATO had a night of
relative restraint, mindful of the Orthodox Easter celebration.''
Attacks, however, resumed with renewed vigor Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   In obtaining the photographs, Freytag said the allies had flown
reconnaissance missions over the area around Orahovac, halfway
between the Kosovo provincial capital of Pristina and the Albanian
border, after receiving intelligence reports that Serb military and
paramilitary police units had committed atrocities against
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The command also released aerial photographs of what it said
were displaced people near Malisevo. The reconnaissance effort
apparently came in response to complaints by some allied civilian
representatives here that the military had not been trying hard
enough to find out what had happened to tens of thousands of
fleeing ethnic Albanian civilians who vanished overnight last week
after Serb border guards turned them back at the frontier with
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are simply indicating something from the air that could be
a mass grave,'' Shea said of the first picture, ``and based on our
experience in Bosnia, of course, a number of mass graves were
identified and recovered and from the air, the form looks something
similar, and that's the reason why we've shown you these
photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a mass grave, but obviously it will be up to the
international tribunal in The Hague, once it's able to go into
Kosovo, to conduct a thorough investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The photographs of what NATO officials said were displaced
Kosovo Albanians were also taken on Friday, and from high altitude.
Clouds and rain over the area since then have made it impossible to
follow up, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs appeared to show vehicles scattered along a road
and crowds of people in temporary shelters in fields or scrub land
near a destroyed village, which the command did not identify.
</P>
<P>
   ``They lack the basic elements of relief and are particularly
short of food,'' British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Sunday
in London. ``The weather currently is against them. It is snowing
today in western Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the alliance could do to help the people believed to
be hiding in the forests and mountains around the province _
400,000 of them by Cook's estimate _ Shea said Sunday, ``The best
thing NATO can do for internally displaced persons is to drive away
the Serbian forces that are attacking them.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior allied diplomat said: ``Air drops, if we could identify
where people are, could be a way of dealing with this, if we aren't
just feeding the Serbs.'' NATO planes would have to fly at high
altitude to avoid Serb anti-aircraft fire from the ground, but that
would mean an increased chance that the food and supplies they
dropped could fall into the hands of Serb forces instead of the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But the refugees are probably moving about on the ground, and
with bad weather expected to last through Wednesday, allied
intelligence is apparently finding it difficult to keep information
up to date.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Serbian Orthodox Christian calendar marked Sunday as Easter,
but allied military authorities had adamantly rejected calls from
the Vatican and from Russian Orthodox leaders in Moscow for a pause
in the bombing to cover the entire 10-day Easter holiday period
that began with Good Friday observances for most Christians on
April 2.
</P>
<P>
   Among the allies, both Greece and Italy had sought political
support for such a pause but did not press when military commanders
responded that a break in the bombing would just give Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic that much more time to push many of
Kosovo's 1.8 million ethnic Albanians from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO commander, said in a television
interview with CNN on Sunday: ``I'm just going to be able to tell
you that we have been sensitive to this holiday, but we are going
to continue the military operation.''
</P>
<P>
   A Greek diplomat at NATO headquarters here said there had been
no political decision to show even the ``relative restraint'' Shea
spoke of.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, almost all the targets NATO planes or
unpiloted missiles hit in the 18th day of bombing, the 24 hours
ending Sunday morning, were in Kosovo and none was anywhere near
Belgrade, according to the sketchy information released Sunday by
the command.

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Eleven months after exploding a series of
nuclear bombs, India tested an intermediate-range missile Sunday
that reportedly traveled more than 1,250 miles in 11 minutes and
left no doubt about the nation's plans to develop a modern system
for delivering the megaton punch of its new weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``With today's launch we have reached a point where no one from
anywhere will dare to threaten us,'' Defense Minister George
Fernandes declared triumphantly.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised address, Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee,
saying that the missiles were for defensive purposes only,
concluded by quoting the 17th-century Sikh guru Gobind Singh: ``Oh
Shiva, bless me, that nothing deters me from doing good deeds, and
where I am obliged to fight, I fight for sure to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Since detonating five underground blasts in the Pokhran Desert
last May, India has spoken consistently of reaching a point of
``minimum credible deterrence.'' Though it has yet to spell out
that minimum, it has been clear that India has felt it needed the
ability to strike deep into the territory of its neighboring
nuclear powers, China and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats have been concerned that India's and
Pakistan's nuclear quests could set off a regional arms race. After
India's May nuclear tests, Pakistan quickly set off nuclear blasts
of its own _ and Pakistani officials hinted on Saturday that they
may answer again, this time with missile tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will probably have to again respond, but we will only make
a decision in a day or two,'' said Pakistan's Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, India tested an earlier, shorter-range version of the
Agni, a missile named with the Hindi word for fire. They had since
developed an Agni that could go further, but had not yet launched
it. Computer simulations, no matter how accurate, do not deter
potential adversaries like a live demonstration. Yesterday the
updated Agni II was fired off the coast of the eastern state of
Orissa, Fernandes said. It splashed into the Bay of Bengal.
</P>
<P>
   The defense minister described the weapons test with
superlatives, boasting that ``we have achieved perfection of a very
high order in missile technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Questioned about plans to equip the missile with nuclear
explosives, he said, ``Whatever we need to meet our security
concerns will be done.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Agni II burns solid fuel, uses state of the art navigation,
carries a payload of more than a ton and can be fired from mobile
launchers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can move the missile to rugged areas with a very compact
system,'' Fernandes said.
</P>
<P>
   Shifting a missile's location over roads lowers the odds of its
destruction in an enemy attack, though experts say it raises the
chance of accidents during the transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This test was overdue and inevitable,'' said Uday Bhaskar,
deputy director of the government supported Institute for Defense
Studies and Analysis. ``If you are going to be a nuclear state, you
have to test the weapons. And this is only the beginning. More
tests have to be done, maybe 15 to 20 tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebratory news in New Delhi about the missile test did not
travel well over the 300 miles to Islamabad. India has fought three
wars with Pakistan in the 51 years since the two nations were
created.
</P>
<P>
   Traiq Altaf, a spokesman for the foreign ministry, said in a
formal statement: ``This is a matter of serious concern to us. The
development of Agni adds to our concerns and is a threat to our
security.''
</P>
<P>
   The Agni I demonstrated two-thirds of the range of the Agni II,
already enough to hit all targets in Pakistan. The updated Agni,
however, could be deployed from Indian territory further from its
border with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan itself has an intermediate range missile, the Ghauri,
which it had tested prior to last year's tit-for-tat nuclear
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to foreign assistance, Pakistan's missile programs are
further along than India's,'' said a RAND study published late last
year, listing China and North Korea as two nations believed to have
given technological support.
</P>
<P>
   Just two months ago, in a hopeful gesture toward peace, Vajpayee
made a bus trip to Pakistan and met with his counterpart, Nawaz
Sharif. Despite the optimism accompanying the meeting, agreements
they reached did not preclude missile tests. Rather, the two
nations simply agreed to forewarn the other before a test took
place.
</P>
<P>
   India said Pakistan received such a warning two days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan is not the only nation in the region that has fought a
war with India. China defeated India in 1962, and territorial
disputes between the two remain unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Agni II, India finally has a reliable nuclear delivery
vehicle to deter China,'' said Brahma Chellaney, an Indian expert
on nuclear weapons. By his calculations, the missile could carry a
reduced nuclear payload deep into China.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could reach Beijing and Shanghai for sure,'' he said.

   The Agni test is a setback for the United States. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott has been attempting to dissuade
India and Pakistan from developing and deploying the missiles and
aircraft that could carry nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret very much India's decision to test,'' said Donna
Roginski, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy here. ``Its leaders
had said they would take care of their military needs at a minimal
level and that does not seem to be the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The Agni test was not unexpected. Vajpayee had announced the
government's intentions in a statement to Parliament in December.
</P>
<P>
   But time was running out. According to experts, the missile
needed to be tested before the start of the monsoon season in
mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the timing is bound to raise some suspicions here.
The Vajpayee government finds itself embattled, facing a likely
withdrawal of support by a key ally in its coalition. A test of its
majority may come as early as this week.

`MARLENE:' ALL THAT DAZZLES IS NOT DIETRICH, HOWEVER REAL SHE
LOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
(DW) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Kitsch!'' growled the voice of Marlene Dietrich,
again and again, in Maximilian Schell's 1984 documentary about her
life. The screen goddess, by then reclusive, whose octogenarian
self was never seen but was very much heard in the film, applied
the German word to anything she regarded as cheaply sentimental.
This ranged from undue attachments to countries to the famous scene
in her 1931 film ``Dishonored'' in which she coolly applied
lipstick before being executed by a firing squad.
</P>
<P>
   It seems likely that had Dietrich been alive to see the show
about her that opened Sunday night at the Cort Theater, titled
(like Schell's documentary) ``Marlene,'' the word ``kitsch'' would
have shot once more from her lips.
</P>
<P>
   This self-described ``musical play'' by Pam Gems, which stars
the commanding Welsh actress Sian Phillips looking like a cryonic
version of the title character, portrays a woman who definitely
didn't stint on sentimentality. Set backstage and onstage during a
concert appearance by Dietrich in Paris in 1969, the evening finds
the most self-contained of Hollywood's sirens in a state of
emotional thaw, lamenting the steep price of being eternally
glamorous and exhuming glorious memories with a catch in her
throat.
</P>
<P>
   Tough and imperious this Dietrich may be, but when she finds a
photograph of her late friend Ernest Hemingway, she can't resist
clutching it to her breast and singing, in a tremulous voice, ``I
wish you bluebirds in the spring.'' It should be noted that when
Ms. Phillips sings, she captures, with uncanny precision, the husky
cello voice that was distinctively Dietrich's. Ms. Gems' script, on
the other hand, turns its subject into what has become a tiringly
familiar type on the New York stage: the suffering sacred monster.
</P>
<P>
   This theater of dead celebrities has flourished in recent years,
with varyingly successful portraits of Maria Callas (``Master
Class''), Lillian Hellman (``Cakewalk''), Diana Vreeland (``Full
Gallop'') and Jacqueline Onassis (``Jackie''). The shows, which
peddle tabloid prurience with a cultural sheen, are notable for
allowing female performers to reclaim the art of female
impersonation.
</P>
<P>
   Whether flip (``Jackie'') or earnest (``Master Class''), such
works usually focus on the personal agony behind the ecstatically
glossy image, while dropping lots of famous names and the sort of
dishy epigrams that drag queens have always thrived on. The plays
often resemble those National Enquirer photographs of famous,
beautiful people frozen in moments of unflattering disarray,
pictures that promise that stars are as prone as anyone to
heartbreak and bad hair days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marlene,'' directed by Sean Mathias, is thuddingly true to
this genre. While it incorporates numerous idiosyncratic details
from biographies of Dietrich, the play flattens them into the sorts
of cliches that Jacqueline Susann used to flesh out her
icon-in-winter characters. The show is by far most interesting when
Ms. Phillips simply does Dietrich the concert performer in the
second act. But the work registers as mechanical throughout, and
for a study in gallantry and glamour under siege, it is
surprisingly unmoving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marlene,'' which began its life in England three years ago,
finds its touring title character, then in her late 60s, in her
dressing room, trying to summon the energy to dazzle. She is
accompanied by her mute dresser, Mutti (Mary Diveny), a
concentration camp survivor, and Vivian (Margaret Whitton), a young
American playwright with a crush on the star who has arrived to
help her idol and sometime lover ``get this face on the road,'' as
Dietrich puts it, one more time.
</P>
<P>
   As Dietrich consults her mirror, checks her memory and gives an
interview to an unseen reporter, the audience is shown assorted
faces of Marlene. There's Marlene the image-making perfectionist,
who gives comically precise instructions on the flowers (which she
has ordered) to be presented during her curtain calls; Marlene the
compulsive hausfrau, who scrubs her dressing room floors kneeling
on her mink coat; Marlene the good friend, who has homeopathic
medicine sent to Georges Pompidou, and Marlene the catty wit, who
dismisses a dreary offering of flowers saying: ``I'm not dead yet.
They can send it to Bette Davis.''
</P>
<P>
   This Marlene is also given to tender reminiscence, temperamental
tantrums and crippling bouts of fear. ``I am Marlene, Marlene,
Marlene,'' she chants, fists clenched like a tennis player before a
break point. She slugs down the booze but holds off on the
tranquilizers. Ms. Gems, a veteran of biodrama (``Piaf,''
``Stanley'') has crammed all this in with dutiful, checklist
perfunctoriness, and it is hard for Ms. Phillips or Mathias to
generate a natural flow.
</P>
<P>
   At moments, the transitions can seem grotesque, as when Marlene
vacillates abruptly between grande dame tyranny and little girl
terror. But Ms. Phillips, best known here for her deliciously evil
turn in the mini-series of ``I, Claudius,'' keeps her dignity and
mostly resists playing for camp.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, in seeking to expose the woman behind the
artificial persona, the play has substituted an equally artificial,
and far less compelling, construct. Ms. Phillips occasionally
brings an amusingly wry world-weariness to her lines, as when
Vivian tells Marlene she loves her and Marlene answers, ``You and
the world, baby.'' But she is largely a prisoner in a soap opera,
except when she is singing, and sometimes even then.
</P>
<P>
   Dietrich fanatics will presumably focus on more important
things, like the meticulous re-creation of the fabled ``nude''
beaded concert gown by Jean Louis, here rendered by Terry Parsons.
Ms. Phillips wears that dress with authority, while subtly
suggesting the discomfort of the aging body beneath it. Yes, awash
in Mark Jonathan's cheekbone-conscious lighting, singing Dietrich
standards like ``Lili Marlene'' and ``Falling in Love Again,'' she
looks and sounds enough like the real thing to give you the
willies.
</P>
<P>
   What she doesn't project is the layered, exquisitely mannered
irony with which Dietrich always presented herself. It's not that
the surface is markedly different from what you see in films of
Dietrich in concert. But there is little of that provocative,
quizzical tension between surface and subtext.
</P>
<P>
   There is a difference between impersonation and interpretation,
and only the latter can illuminate. Ms. Phillips, though her skills
of replication are formidable, remains largely an impersonator
here. You end the evening thinking that as long as there are shows
like ``Marlene,'' opening a Madame Tussaud's in Times Square would
be superfluous.

HOW ONE MAN USED CORPORATE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION TO GET A PIECE OF A
BIG DEAL
</HEADLINE>

 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chester C. Davenport, the managing director of a private
investment firm in Bethesda, Md., does not deny that he got a piece
of the Ameritech &UR;  &LR; Corp.'s $3.3 billion sale of half of its wireless
telephone business, at least in part, because he is black.
</P>
<P>
   But he will also tell you that after years of struggle, he has
no problem with the concept of corporate affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   The GTE &UR;  &LR; Corp., which along with Ameritech is one of the
nation's biggest local phone companies, bought the lion's share of
the Ameritech properties _ about 93 percent. But for an investment
of about $60 million, Davenport's Georgetown Partners &UR;  &LR; agreed to
acquire 7 percent of the equity in the venture that will run the
former Ameritech operation.
</P>
<P>
   GTE did not need _ or, according to some executives close to the
deal, particularly desire _ Georgetown's help, though it made some
vague statements about Davenport's company helping develop minority
markets.
</P>
<P>
   But SBC Communications &UR;  &LR; Inc., which is trying to win approval
from the Federal Communications Commission for its pending
acquisition of Ameritech, pushed for Georgetown's participation, at
least partly to curry favor with William E. Kennard, the
commission's chairman, the executives said. Kennard, who is black,
has tried to increase minority participation in the communications
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport is one of the wealthiest black entrepreneurs in the
nation with a net worth of perhaps as much as $100 million. Ask him
whether he believes that he would have been invited into the
Ameritech deal if he were white and his answer opens a revealing
window on a new sort of corporate affirmative action that people
from the Rev. Jesse Jackson to C. Michael Armstrong, chairman of
the AT&AMP;T &UR;  &LR; Corp., are seizing on to bring blacks into the
traditionally white worlds of telecommunications and finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if I were white, I would own one of these damn
telephone companies, OK?'' Davenport said in an interview last
week. ``All the time I've spent here, whatever money I have now, if
I were white, doing everything I've done, I would have 100 times
more money than I have now, OK?''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport's obviously shocked public-relations consultant
interjected, ``You're not joking, right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm not joking,'' Davenport responded. ``I would have 100
times more money than I have now, and I think that these guys know
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``these guys'' in that statement are the white businessmen
and financiers among whom Davenport seems to move easily.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to comment on SBC's motives in bringing him into
last week's deal. But he insisted that any benefits black people in
business may enjoy these days because of the color of their skin
are greatly outweighed by the stream of irrevocable, racially
motivated slights and pitfalls that have befallen them over the
course of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never make up that time, the opportunity,'' Davenport
said of racially motivated setbacks. ``That's what I'm saying. This
whole networking thing you're talking about, I mean just think
about it. Just think about what I had to go through. If I had that
network, the network that these guys were operating in, I'd have
100 times more money than I have now.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport has ended up with an impressive network of his own,
but he will tell you that it was forged from struggle.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, just before attending his first lecture on his first
day as the first black student at the University of Georgia's law
school, he recalls looking up to find that none of his fellow
students had sat within 15 chairs of him in any direction. Before
the next class, the professor made up a mandatory seating chart.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in the top 5 percent of his class, he began his
career in the tax division of the Justice Department, followed by
stints on the Senate Banking Committee staff and with a mortgage
banking venture backed partly by Salomon Brothers. ``Back then, for
an African-American you always had to be the best,'' he said. ``It
was always, if you're not better than everybody you're not going to
get anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It was my mentality then, it is my mentality today,
that you have to be better and you have to be smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Washington around 1973 and eventually joined
Jimmy Carter's presidential campaign. After the election he became
assistant secretary of transportation and soon became friends with
two men who would become among the most influential black power
brokers in Washington, the late Ronald H. Brown and Vernon Jordan,
who later became his lawyer. Davenport stayed in the government for
about 18 months, then he made his first big business deal.
</P>
<P>
   His partner was Mortimer B. Zuckerman, who was then building his
real estate empire. Broad swaths of Washington were being
redeveloped in the late 1970s, and Davenport used his contacts in
government to help get a piece of property in southwest Washington
rezoned for commercial use.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the redevelopment authority in Washington judged
redevelopment applications based partly on their level of minority
participation. That proved lucrative for Davenport and his law
partners, James L. Hudson and Willie Leftwich, whose firm became
bond counsel for the city.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, The Washington Post reported that the three lawyers had
received 15 percent of a proposed $25 million redevelopment project
without contributing any money to the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat across the table from these guys and said, `Look, how
much are you willing to put into this?''' Nathan Landow, the
project developer, told The Post at the time. ``They looked back
and said: `This is the way it has to be. No money.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Landow added that the attitude of Washington's redevelopment
authority was `` `don't even bother to come in unless you're with
the right people.'''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport said last week that he could not recall the Landow
deal specifically, but through most of the 1980s he continued to
work mostly in the Washington real estate market.
</P>
<P>
   He founded Georgetown Capital around 1989 at least in part to
take advantage of new financing opportunities being developed by
Michael Milken at Drexel Burnham Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   Although Davenport never completed a deal through Drexel, he
studied Milken's techniques for raising high-yield debt financing.
Then in the early 1990s, Davenport and his partners acquired United
Technologies' automobile emissions testing business for about $30
million, of which about $23 million was borrowed.
</P>
<P>
   The timing was fortuitous. Georgetown Partners acquired the unit
just as Congress passed a law requiring uniform automobile testing
procedures. Georgetown sold the business last year to Stone Rivet
Inc. for $266 million.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Davenport has moved into the telecommunications business.
According to executives close to last week's deal, Ameritech
initially wanted to sell Georgetown all the wireless units in the
deal and had even been willing to help the firm find financing.
Such a sale would have had the benefit of keeping the wireless
units out of the hands of a big competitor, like GTE, which has
agreed to merge with the Bell Atlantic &UR;  &LR; Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But that thought died, at least partly because the Justice
Department, which was also reviewing the Ameritech-SBC merger, said
that it would not approve the deal if Ameritech helped arrange the
financing for selling its own business. (Ameritech had to sell the
wireless properties partly to avoid an antitrust conflict with
SBC's wireless business.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the facilitating roles in the deal was played by Jackson
and his Wall Street Project, the part of his Rainbow/PUSH
organization that tries to increase minority participation in big
business.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, who has known Jackson for about 10 years and who has
contributed to the Wall Street Project, told Jackson about his
interest in telecommunications. Jackson helped SBC and Ameritech
develop a list of minority entrepreneurs with whom they could do
business. Last month Rainbow/PUSH endorsed the Ameritech-SBC
merger.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who declined to comment, has had other successes in the
communications business. At the Wall Street Project's conference in
January, Bell Atlantic, GTE, SBC and Ameritech each agreed to
direct between $50 million and $100 million of their pension funds
to minority money managers. And AT&AMP;T made good on a promise that
Armstrong made at the conference to use more minority underwriters;
it included Blaylock &AMP; Partners, a minority-owned investment bank,
among co-managers of its recent $8 billion bond offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had an ongoing dialogue with Rainbow/PUSH in sharing
their views of where we are and how we can share our wealth with
the minority universe,'' Edward M. Dwyer, AT&AMP;T's treasurer, said in
an interview. ``They helped us focus our initiatives better,'' he
said, adding that Jackson's organization had no direct role in
AT&AMP;T's selection of Blaylock.

<P>
   They have been partners in a highly successful marriage for most
of the century, ever since William S. Paley put the two together
for CBS radio. But for the relationship between broadcast networks
and their affiliated stations, while not permanently estranged, is
certainly on the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Two networks, Fox and ABC, made decisions last week that were
directly antithetical to the interest of their affiliates. If that
message was not clear enough, executives at both networks
underscored in interviews that the moves were part of efforts to
redefine totally the network-affiliate relationship _ with the

</P>
<P>
   More pointedly, some network executives now question the
long-term value of relying on affiliated stations to deliver
network programs. The executives are confident they can force the
stations to accept tougher terms in the future because of a
fundamental shift in the way network programs are distributed, away
from traditional over-the-airwaves broadcasting and toward delivery
by cable or satellite.
</P>
<P>
   NBC President Robert Wright has said that his network might
consider the option of replacing an affiliate reluctant to renew
its network contract in ``a sensible fashion'' with a channel on a
local cable system.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior network executive, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said of the moves made by Fox and ABC last week: ``This
is only the beginning. This is what the networks should have been
doing a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason, this executive said: ``Networks aren't as important
as they used to be. And the stations are much less important than
they used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   For the affiliate side of the business, those are fighting words
that could lead to a period of open hostilities. Among the actions
one affiliate executive, Alan J. Bell, said might be possible:
significant pre-emptions of network shows and even defections by
affiliates to different networks when contractually possible.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, the president of the broadcast division of Freedom
Communications Inc., a company with three ABC affiliates, said that
ABC and Fox had ``declared civil war on their affiliates.'' He
added, ``When you make war on affiliates, you are inviting these
proud local media barons to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   David Barrett, the executive vice president of the Hearst
Corp.'s Hearst-Argyle Television unit and head of the ABC affiliate
board, said of the network-affiliate relationship: ``We're in a
deadly embrace here. But no one wants to have a nuclear war.''
</P>
<P>
   What Fox and ABC did last week was take steps to benefit
themselves at the expense of their affiliates, without any input
from the executives at the stations. ABC announced that it would
start a cable channel that will replay soap operas owned by ABC on
the same day that they are broadcast on ABC's affiliates. The
announcement represented the most direct challenge ever mounted to
the program exclusivity that has been a cornerstone of the
network-affiliate relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Fox was even more aggressive. It told its affiliates it was
claiming for itself more than 20 percent of the commercial time the
stations had been selling to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Looming in the future is an almost certain drive by the networks
to end the system that has compelled them to pay affiliates a fee
for carrying network programs. That fee, known as compensation, has
come in addition to the commercial time that affiliates sell in
network shows. The networks cede the time in order to assure
themselves of access to hours on the local stations on which to
place their programming.
</P>
<P>
   Fox already does not pay affiliates compensation. The other
networks would like to stop doing so, since that would mean another
$200 million or so to their bottom lines. Those bottom lines have
been acutely depressed in recent years everywhere but at NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Fox executives, in defending their decision to redirect
affiliate revenue back toward the network, noted that Fox had
gradually improved its standing to a point where it is now a solid
No. 2 behind NBC in the most desirable audience group for
advertisers, adults between the ages of 18 and 49. Yet the Fox
network barely makes money.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many Fox affiliates have profit margins of 50 percent or
more. Moreover, the Fox executives argue that many of their
affiliates were once weak independent stations that have become
enormous assets to their companies thanks to Fox's success.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said Fox seems to have concluded that it can push its
affiliates around. ``Fox is saying to its affiliates: `I found you
in the gutter, drunk, with vomit on your clothes, and a bottle of
Thunderbird in your back pocket. Then I cleaned you up, gave you a
haircut and shave and a job in the mail room. Now you're doing
well, so you should do whatever I tell you to do.'''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling a previous showdown with a network in the late 1980s,
when CBS tried to eliminate compensation to stations, only to stir
up an insurrection and eventually back down, Bell said: ``I don't
think the Fox thing is going to stick. It's going to force them to
meet and try to do things together.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Barrett and Bell questioned the network version of
television economics, saying that the companies that own the
networks, far from being bankrupt entities, make billions in
profits from their stations and syndication divisions. ``It is
intellectually dishonest to say we're making profits and they're
not,'' Barrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell speculated that the networks plan to swallow the station
business whole. ``They would like to eliminate me,'' he said.
``Like radio, they want to own multiple stations in every market,
even two networks.''
</P>
<P>
   The networks have indeed pressed Congress to change rules that
limit their ownership of stations. Mel Karmazin, the chairman of
the CBS Corp., has openly said he would like to own a second
network as well, preferably NBC.
</P>
<P>
   The affiliates argue that in trying to bully them the networks
are playing a dangerous game. ``Distribution is not fungible,''
Barrett said, citing numerous examples where networks either
benefit or suffer from the strength or weakness of a local
affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   But network executives say competition from multitudes of
channels has reduced the number of local stations that have a
powerful impact on the lives of viewers, and besides, most stations
are now locked into long-term deals, which means they cannot quit
their networks for three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave pre-emptions as the affiliates' only weapon in
the near term. Bell noted that most ABC stations carry both
``Nightline'' and ``Politically Incorrect'' in their late-night
time periods, when they could make much more money by programming
repeats of a situation comedy like ``Seinfeld'' and keeping all the
advertising money to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to hurt programs as good as those,'' Bell said.
But he said revenge could become a motivation for some affiliates
who do not want to see their business relationship with their
network redefined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business is not just about figures,'' he said. ``It's about
people. And that means there's a lot of emotion and drama.''

ONLINE MERCHANTS GROW UNEASY AS WEB PORTALS SELL MORE GOODS
THEMSELVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many Internet merchants are feeling nervous these days about
their partnerships with portal sites, the gateways to the Web for
millions of Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   Portals like Yahoo, Excite and America Online have generated
unbridled enthusiasm on Wall Street for their ability to attract
users and a diverse roster of advertisers. Yet, while advertising
continues to drive revenues, analysts are questioning the portals'
ability to sustain growth with a business model that relies heavily
on advertising. The obvious answer: grab a piece of the growing
e-commerce pie.
</P>
<P>
   Web merchants like Barnesandnoble.com and CD Now may pay fees as
high as $5 million apiece each year to be featured on portal sites.
Some say they are not eager to see the potential e-commerce
competition from the very Web sites that carry the merchants'
customer traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The situation has created a growing sense of distrust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got finished doing a panel at a conference,'' said
Michael Baum, vice president for e-commerce at the Go Network, a
portal started in January by the Walt Disney Co. and Infoseek,
which itself is partly owned by Disney. ``I told an audience of
merchants that our goal is to empower them, not compete with
them,'' said Baum, who recalled that his reassurances seemed to be
well received. ``I must have had 60 merchants come up to me
afterward and say, `Wow, I didn't know that's the way it is.'''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and industry executives say this uneasy phase in the
relationship between portals and merchants could lead to a better
shopping environment for consumers, if it leads to more choices.
But the road to that high ground is strewn with obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   First, Internet merchants fear that portals will compete with
them by selling goods directly to their users, as Lycos, a popular
portal, has announced it plans to do. With its pending acquisition
by USA Networks, which also owns the Home Shopping Network, Lycos
hopes to fulfill orders of goods directly from its own warehouse _
thus potentially circumventing the merchants that pay to be
featured on its site. Lycos' featured merchants currently include
Eddie Bauer and Etoys.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond direct competition, however, merchants are concerned that
portals will increasingly try to keep consumers on the portal site
for most or all of a shopping transaction, rather than direct them
to the merchants' sites, as is now typically the case.
</P>
<P>
   By ``taking more of the transaction,'' as the practice is known,
portals rankle retailers in various ways. The portal can capture
most of the buyer's personal information _ through a registration
process or a credit card form. Merchants fear that the portals will
then sell that information to competing retailers, which could then
market competing goods to those customers.
</P>
<P>
   There's another concern. Top-tier Internet retailers go to great
lengths to merchandise their goods effectively and implement
technological innovations, like offering shoppers a personalized
online catalog. The more time shoppers spend on a portal's general
commerce area, the less time they have for the personal,
brand-enhancing flourishes on the merchant's site.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce executives say that America Online has been
particularly sensitive to such concerns, by generally ushering
customers to the merchant's site early in the shopping process. And
in cases where America Online does gather customer information,
these executives say, the company pledges to its merchants that it
will not let that information fall into the hands of competitors.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Less sensitive to these issues, many say, is Yahoo, the portal
that attracts the most traffic. Though other portals offer shopping
channels that prominently feature certain retailers, Yahoo instead
offers categories of goods, like outdoor apparel or music. A Yahoo
search feature enables shoppers to find and purchase an item from
any number of stores that have bought space on the site. On Yahoo,
in other words, the product _ not the retailer _ is king.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo also keeps shoppers on its site for the entire
transaction, so merchants have less control of the data, and the
shopper's experience, than they do with other portals.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Brady, Yahoo's vice president for production, acknowledges
the tension such an approach has caused, but stressed that it was
meant to help customers find goods they needed, not usurp merchant
brands. ``I think it's a healthy tension, and I think that's
natural, and there's room for both sides to succeed,'' Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   But Marc Johnson, an analyst with Jupiter Communications, a
research firm, said that this tension could cost portals like Yahoo
in the long run. So far, traffic leaders like Yahoo have been able
to justify charging merchants millions of dollars to be linked to
their sites for the same reason a television network can charge
hefty advertising rates for a popular program: because that's where
the potential customers are. But if merchants feel that a portal is
actually undermining its business, the checkbooks may slam shut.
</P>
<P>
   ``When these portal deals come up for renewal, merchants will
look at them much more closely,'' Johnson said. ``It's not a given
anymore that they're going to renew.''
</P>
<P>
   Arno Harris, vice president of the online retailer 911gifts.com,
which has portal deals with America Online and Excite, among
others, predicted that the discord between merchants and portals
would ``change the strategic landscape'' of Internet shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to get lost by focusing on immediate business needs,
but the guiding principle in all of this is delivering the best
possible customer experience,'' Harris said. That experience
involves a multitude of merchandising and customer service nuances,
he said, adding, ``Portals will never be able to provide that.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, some merchants are willing to share the wealth
with portal sites, if trust is established. Revenue sharing,
wherein merchants pay portals a small fee for each transaction
generated, is an increasingly common arrangement between portals
and their partners, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If portals are instrumental in making e-commerce run, I'm
willing to do a revenue share and to share limited data, if that
improves the customer conversion rate and gets more people buying
online,'' said Jonathan Morris, executive vice president of
Bluefly.com, a discount apparel merchant, which is featured on
several major portals, including Go Network and Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all trying to figure this out,'' Morris said. ``For the
most part, the portals have been modest enough to say no one knows
the best way to structure e-commerce. The ones that are
closed-minded about it are going to fail because they'll lose their
merchants.''
</P>
<P>
   Baum, of Go Network, said he was not surprised that some
merchants were fearful. ``Any time you see business models collide,
as they have on the Internet, people quickly gravitate to fearful
rather than a forward-thinking position,'' Baum said. ``I just
don't think that as a whole, portals have done a good job of
sending out the message of what we're all about.''

INDEPENDENT JOURNALIST KILLED BY ARMED GUNMEN IN BELGRADE

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ In a vicious message to the few remaining
independent news outlets in Yugoslavia, gunmen on Sunday shot and
killed a well-known opposition publisher outside his apartment
building in central Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Slavko Curuvija, the owner of the Dnevni Telegraf, or The Daily
Telegraph, and the news biweekly Evropljanin, was shot as he
returned home from an Easter lunch with his wife, historian Branka
Prpa.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Prpa told police and friends that two gunmen dressed in
black, including black leather jackets, fired several bullets into
Curuvija's back. They then pistol-whipped her, opening a large cut
on her head, she said, before firing more shots into Curuvija's
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe that they're killing journalists,'' Ms. Prpa
said afterward in her apartment, clearly stunned. ``Was he so
dangerous for the state? He was just doing his job.''
</P>
<P>
   In the widespread crackdown by President Slobodan Milosevic
against the independent news media, Dnevni Telegraf and Evropljanin
were heavily fined last year for breaching Serbia's restrictive
information law, passed only in October, and then the publications
were banned.
</P>
<P>
   Curuvija reregistered them in Montenegro, Yugoslavia's second,
more liberal republic. They were printed in Croatia, but their
distribution in Serbia had been widely curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the Yugoslav government has moved to shut down
all independent media here, closing radio station B-92 in Belgrade
and reopening it under more compliant leadership, as well as
closing Radio 021 in Novi Sad. All independent Albanian-language
media in Kosovo have also been shut down or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Curuvija and two reporters were fined last month for linking
last year's killing of a Belgrade doctor to the Serbian vice prime
minister, Milovan Bojic. Later, a police investigation concluded
that it was not linked to Bojic. Curuvija, who refused to pay the
fine, was sentenced to five months in jail, and was awaiting the
results of his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, state television read an open attack on Curuvija,
accusing him of supporting NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia. The
commentary said: ``Today when these bombs that were desired so much
are killing Serbia, the traitors are silent. If they expect Serbs
and Serbia to be enslaved, they're waiting in vain. And if they
hoped their treason would be forgotten they hoped in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, in the newspaper Politika Ekspres, a headline
read: ``Curuvija has finally got his bombs.'' The article quoted
Milosevic's powerful wife, Mira Markovic, as saying: ``The owner of
a Belgrade daily newspaper said he supports the United States in
its desire to bomb Serbia.'' The writer of the article then
continues: ``This is of course Slavko Curuvija.''
</P>
<P>
   Curuvija denied making any such comment.
</P>
<P>
   The official Yugoslav news agency, Tanjug, reported on Sunday
night that Curuvija had been killed ``by unknown perpetrators,''
and added, ``The police are intensively searching for the
perpetrators.''
</P>
<P>
   Curujiva, who was about 50, was a tall, elegant man with a small
gray beard. He and Ms. Prpa recently gave an interview for a story
that was published in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will go to jail for five months, and after this bombing,
who will care?'' Ms. Prpa asked. ``The West can't help him, that's
another effect of this bombing. Milosevic can act like a dictator
and lock us all up, and who will care for us? I agree the West
should care for the human rights of ethnic Albanians, but do they
also care for mine?''
</P>
<P>
   Curuvija, said that it is impossible now for democrats or
dissidents to raise up their heads in this war fever. ``The Serbs
feel under a collective guilty verdict, and the democratic forces
are pushed into their mouse holes because of this permanent state
of emergency,'' he said. ``In this moment, you cannot say you want
to change something, or bring Serbia closer to the West, which is
bombing your country _ it makes you a traitor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All this helps Milosevic,'' he added. ``Everything Western is
terrible right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Prpa said softly: ``The worst of all is to feel you have no
future. What kind of future do we have?''

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Belgrade's markets were stuffed full with
meat and vegetables of all kinds for the Orthodox Easter
celebrations on Sunday, with formerly scarce items, like cooking
oil and sugar, plentiful in state stores at cheap prices.
</P>
<P>
   Wartime regulations, instituted a few days after NATO's bombing
campaign began 19 days ago, have kept prices down. After a few
early days of shortages, as worried residents bought up
imperishables, the state funneled new supplies into the shops.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarettes and gasoline remain very scarce and expensive on the
black market, when available at all, although the official state
media on Friday promised that new supplies of cigarettes would
arrive soon.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking oil and sugar in particular, which had been hard to find
in the weeks before the war, suddenly filled the shelves at
reasonable prices: cooking oil is about 11 dinars a liter, or about
63 cents; sugar is about 9.5 dinars per kilogram, or about 54 cents
for 2.2 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The dinar has been losing value against hard currencies, now
trading on the black market at about 17.5 dinars per dollar and 10
per German mark, making prices expressed in dollar terms seem
absurdly low. But salaries and pensions are also much lower than in
the West, roughly averaging $60 and $40 a month, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Springtime in fertile Yugoslavia is always marked by plentiful
greens, spring onions, radishes and other vegetables, but supplies
of fresh fruits, even imported varieties like kiwis, are available
from Greek suppliers, shop owners said Sunday in Belgrade and
nearby Zemun, where the head of the Serbian Orthodox Church,
Patriarch Pavle, came to preside over Easter services.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksandara Vucic, a 26-year-old mother of two small children,
said the filled shelves were reassuring in a difficult time. ``I
know the government is doing this to raise our spirits, but I'm not
unhappy about it,'' she said. ``Why should I be?''
</P>
<P>
   But the amount of Greek produce coming into the capital is less
than before, the shop owners say. There are no flights to Belgrade,
its airports damaged and airspace closed by NATO. NATO attacks on
Yugoslavia's oil refineries and fuel supplies, designed to hobble
its military campaign against the Kosovo Liberation Army in Kosovo,
have meant extreme shortages of gasoline and diesel fuel for truck
transport, let alone private cars.
</P>
<P>
   But authorities in Belgrade have been trying to negotiate with
the army for more gasoline so that the city's shops, many of them
private, can get new stocks of food and other consumables, said
Deputy Mayor Milan Bozic.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers are full of stories of war profiteers arrested by
martial-law authorities. Western cigarettes are about 25 to 30
marks a carton of 10 packs, or about $14.30 to $17.15, with locally
made ones, which few people favor, at about $11 a carton.
</P>
<P>
   Despite early worries, bread and flour supplies are also
plentiful. Flour is only 4.5 dinars a kilo, or about 25 cents for
2.2 pounds, and milk is only 20 cents a quart. Decent cuts of pork
and beef cost from $2.57 to $3.43 a kilo, with good salami roughly
double that. A good ham for Easter is roughly $6.30, a decent
chicken is about $1.43 a kilo. And coffee, virtually an essential
in Belgrade, is about $6.80 a kilo for whole beans.
</P>
<P>
   Gordana Perazic, chatting outside the Church of the Holy Mother
of God in Zemun, where Patriarch Pavle conducted services Sunday,
said that this Easter had sent the Serbs special tribulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``But our tables are full, thank God,'' she said. ``Not even
Hitler could scare us, so Clinton won't manage to do it. We have a
heroic heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Perazic, who works with Russian tourists here, said she
hoped that no one would learn to hate the people bombing them, and
that the Americans, too, would understand that the Serbs were a
generous people. ``One person does not make a nation,'' she said in
a clear reference to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the American nation does not hate the Serb
people. It is a matter of one or two people, not the rest,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In his Easter message, Patriarch Pavle did not shy away from the
war. ``We pray for peace and good will among people, but now we are
suffering,'' the statement said. ``All just proposals for a
peaceful solution for the Kosovo problem based on respect for all
people have been rejected. NATO has offered only a cynical
explanation about the necessity of bombing to prevent a human
catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to be responding to an unusual Easter statement made
Saturday by the Yugoslav army's chief of staff, Gen. Dragoljub
Ojdanic, who said, ``In this difficult and fateful historic moment,
the Yugoslav army expects a strong contribution from the Serbian
Orthodox Church to unity, strengthening belief in the justification
of the defense of, and love toward the fatherland.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Milica Sabinovic, a 29-year-old obstetrics nurse, lives near the
Yugoslav air force headquarters blown up by NATO in the center of
Zemun. ``I was walking my dogs when it happened,'' she said. ``It
was terrible that night,'' she said, then stopped, suddenly
speechless, brushing back her hennaed hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Easter is a celebration, like always, but even more holy,
more precious, because of everything the people from the outside
are doing to us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same, but with more temptations that the Lord sends
us.'' Asked what she meant, she said: ``Oh, the hatred, the anger
toward the enemy. These are temptations that must be overcome. As
Christ said, `God forgive them for they know not what they do.' If
they did know,'' she said with a sweet and fervent smile, ``I'm
sure they wouldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sabinovic always comes to this church, and was in the third
row when she began to faint from the press of the worshippers, the
heat and the incense. She was helped from the church by Vojislav
Cavic, 43, a driver at a factory making animal feed.
</P>
<P>
   Cavic, too, said this was a special Easter, but said he was
``100 percent sure that NATO and the Americans would be vanquished
in this war.'' If the war does not stop soon, he said, echoing the
state media, ``we will enter a grand alliance with Russia and
Belarus and then the United States will have to make concessions.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he dropped the belligerence and said: ``We all live for a
better time. War is a dark time for us. Will the bombs hit here or
there? We live with this fear every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sabinovic, who is still without telephone service after the
bombing of Zemun, said that she had managed to surmount her fears.
``I prayed with all my heart before the fear went away,'' she said.
``Prayer is better than any sedative.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she thought Serb forces were committing atrocities in
Kosovo, she said: ``If ethnic cleansing were going on, I would
speak out against it. But it's not true,'' she said sweetly. ``Half
my family is from Kosovo, and the problem in Kosovo are all the
Albanians that Tito let in, who don't even have Yugoslav papers.''
</P>
<P>
   She smiled again. ``We should pray for everyone of every
religion,'' she said. ``And for our enemies, we should probably
pray even more.''

   KOSOVO-AIRBASE _ RINAS AIR FIELD, Albania _ In just seven days,
the United States Air Force has turned this sleepy Albanian airport
into a surging Western military airbase which is already moving in
more military supplies than during the Berlin Airlift. For the
airmen and women filling the sandbags and running the air tower,
the biggest headache is the mud. It's rained hard for the past
several nights, and people have up to six inches of water in their
tents when they wake up in the morning. Once the base is fully
operational, it will be one of the busiest air fields in the world.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although Rupert Murdoch has an obsession with sports, no one has
ever accused him of being a team player. And last week he put on a
remarkable individual performance.
</P>
<P>
   Even before last week, Murdoch's News Corp. _ already a power
here and overseas in broadcast sports coverage _ had became a
dominant force in sports cable television. With a three-year string
of investments, he had turned the News Corp.'s Fox Entertainment
unit into a partial owner of all but four of the nation's 23
regional sports networks _ cable networks that arrange with
professional teams to carry all games that are not picked up by
national networks or local broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   But it was last week that Murdoch swung for the fences. In
intricate deals worth billions of dollars, Fox Entertainment moved
to take outright control of two of the nation's top five regional
sports networks, as measured by number of cable subscribers. And he
raised his stakes in 13 other regional networks _ including the two
in the lucrative New York market that together carry the games of
all the local professional baseball, basketball and hockey teams.
</P>
<P>
   In very short order, in other words, the Australian-born
Murdoch, who seldom watches games on the tube or in person, has
acquired all or part of the regional cable rights to most
professional U.S. teams. (That does not include teams in the
National Football League, which deals only with the national
networks _ like Fox's broadcast network.)
</P>
<P>
   With Walt Disney Co.'s ESPN still dominating cable sports _ 75
million subscribers nationally, compared with the 65 million total
for all of Murdoch's various regional pacts _ the playing field may
not yet be level. But the topology has changed. Not only must many
of the nation's cable operators now pay homage to Murdoch or his
partners if they want to offer some of the most popular local
programming on cable, but suddenly ESPN, long the star of cable
sports, may have a viable, voracious competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Pilson, who heads a sports television consulting firm,
considers the Murdoch game plan a smart one because it offers
advertisers a form of one-stop shopping for most of the teams in
three major professional sports. ``They are creating an alterative
to ESPN for advertisers and sponsors that want to buy into
baseball, hockey and NBA basketball on a national level,'' Pilson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the professional teams carried on local cable, Murdoch now
has access to all but a half-dozen holdouts that have forged local
pacts: the San Diego Padres, Florida Marlins and Tampa Bay Devil
Rays baseball teams, the Florida Panthers in the National Hockey
League, and the Phoenix Suns and Portland Trailblazers in the
National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch was traveling last week and not available for an
interview. But he is known for his oft-stated conviction that
sports _ like movies, news and children's programming _ is a format
with universal appeal. And as he tightens his grip on the regional
sports services, he appears intent on creating the equivalent of a
national network that can rival ESPN for advertiser dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN says it is not worried about Murdoch's moves, the
centerpiece of which was an agreement to buy the cable titan John
C. Malone's interest in the Fox/Liberty Sports cable venture in
exchange for a 5 percent stake in the News Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even after the deal, we are facing the same competition
against the same teams,'' an ESPN spokeswoman said. ``All that has
changed is the ownership. The thing is, our prime time viewership
was up 12 percent last year.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, ESPN and Fox are attacking the same market from
different ends. ESPN's is primarily a top-down, national network
approach, based on relationships with professional and college
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Fox cable model is based on local and regional
fare, with a supplemental national overlay.
</P>
<P>
   One of its regional networks, Fox Sports West 2, for example,
carries games of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team _ which News
Corp. owns _ along with Los Angeles Clippers basketball and Anaheim
Mighty Ducks hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports West 2's 3 million subscribers also get some
professional and college games of national interest, including some
Pacific 10 Conference football and basketball, but much of the
nonprofessional fare involves local offerings like University of
Southern California baseball, high school basketball and football
and horse racing from Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   The real national overlay comes from Fox/Liberty Sports Net, a
24-hour service filled with talk and news shows, which is owned
jointly by Cablevision Systems Corp. and News Corp., which also
manages the service. It is in this arena where Fox and ESPN compete
most directly, as when Fox Sports News Prime Time goes up against
ESPN Sportscenter _ and where Fox is intent on building a cable
brand that can attract national advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are doing is growing the network feed,'' Tracy Dolgin,
Fox/Liberty chief operating officer, said. ``As that gets better,
people who are not as passionate about the home teams will want the
regional service anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Fox lures new subscribers to its local offerings,
its greater control of the regional networks could let it move more
quickly to buy programming rights and might allow it to raise the
monthly fees it charges cable operators.
</P>
<P>
   That influence worries some sports-business experts.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Zimbalist, a sports economist who teaches at Smith College,
is one who expresses concern about the concentration of financial
and media power Murdoch has amassed. Not only does News Corp. own
the Dodgers, but Fox is a partial owner of other teams, including
the New York Knicks basketball and the New York Rangers hockey
teams, through its partnership with Cablevision.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One example illustrates the sporting experts' concerns.
Zimbalist said that some Major League Baseball team owners were
already worried about the Dodgers' seven-year, $105 million
contract with pitcher Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It represents Brown's value not only to the Dodgers but to the
Fox media empire _ since what Fox is trying to do is to develop a
name for its network by assuring a winning team,'' Zimbalist said.
``Part of the value of the contract is the expectation of the
double return. That means Rupert Murdoch has the reason to spend
more for contracts, creating the issue of salary imbalance.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable operators are also worried. As long as Malone's Liberty
Media Group was a Murdoch partner, the intricate web of alliances
with cable operators made it tough for the venture to foist pay
increases on cable operators. After all, Malone's ties to
Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's second-largest cable
operator, provided a buffer.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Media itself was originally spun off from TCI. And even
though AT&AMP;T Corp. bought TCI last year, Liberty Media remains an
AT&AMP;T tracking stock with a close relationship to the cable company.
And Liberty has investments in other cable companies, owning 10
percent of the cable leader Time Warner Inc., and in programming
services like the Discovery Network, in which Cox Communications
and other cable companies also own a stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberty was partnered with the cable operators, so they
couldn't be too aggressive about jamming rate increases through,''
said Niraj Gupta, a media analyst at Schroder &AMP; Co. ``Now it will
be easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Fox did manage to raise rates about 18 percent. But
Disney's ESPN, which has no ties to cable-system ownership, has
been even more aggressive. Last year, the service, which charges an
average of 85 cents per subscriber per month, said it would raise
rates 20 percent. And this year it plans to add a 20 percent
surcharge to defray costs of its rights to some NFL games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now all the sports are controlled by two companies, neither of
which owns any cable systems,'' said one bitter cable operator, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``ESPN announced a 20 percent
rate increase,'' he said. ``When we raise our rates 5 percent,
people cry out for reregulation.''
</P>
<P>
   John Mancel, who follows the sports business for Paul Kagan
Associates, a media consulting firm, said regional sports services
generally get less per subscriber than the 85 cents a month ESPN
charges, probably about 75 cents.
</P>
<P>
   And there are other limits to Murdoch's power. It would be
difficult, for example, to prime the pump by buying more sports
teams.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's rules give an owner the ability to have multiple
stakes in as many teams as desired, but only as long as the total
combined percentage of all teams is under 50 percent. After
Murdoch's deal with Liberty is completed, News Corp. will have 40
percent of the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is another matter. A person or organization that is a
managing partner of one team is forbidden to own even the smallest
stake in any other baseball team. By the same token, News Corp.'s
40 percent stake in the Rangers would prohibit any further
investment in an NHL team.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even without acquiring any more teams, the power Murdoch
has consolidated over regional cable sports is extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   The regional business was born in the 1980s, when the Englewood,
Colo.-based TCI started sports services in cities like Pittsburgh
and Seattle. And at times, the sports team owners also had a stake
in the service _ a tradition that continues in cases like
Cablevision's ownership of the Knicks and Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   TCI was by no means the sole player at this game. Cablevision
was starting regional sports services in areas where it owned cable
systems, including New York, Chicago and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, as was Malone's wont, TCI transferred ownership
of its sports services to its programming arm, Liberty Media, which
in turn bought up more services. And in April 1996 Rupert Murdoch
joined with Liberty to gain half ownership of Liberty's stake in
nine regional sports services.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisitive Murdoch-Malone alliance, in turn, made an $850
million investment in Rainbow Media, as Cablevision called its six
regional services. That deal paved the way for a matrix of regional
services that could also deliver national programming. Thus was the
groundwork laid for Murdoch's coup last week.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of last week, Murdoch held an interest in all but
four of the nation's regional cable sports networks. He would
probably like to own them all, but there are sticking points.
Sportschannel Florida, for instance, is majority owned by the
financier H. Wayne Huizenga, with Cablevision and Fox merely
minority investors. And any change in ownership triggers a
provision that lets Huizenga buy out his partners, should he choose
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Comcast Corp. has no plans to sell its sports
service, which dominates the Philadelphia market.
</P>
<P>
   Still, whether or not Murdoch makes a clean sweep of the
industry, his work is far from finished. Already he has plans to
offer Fox Sports Net Interactive, a joint venture with Access TV
that would let viewers pay $9.95 to select among various camera
angles while watching games.
</P>
<P>
   And some purists worry that Murdoch's quest for team _ or
athlete _ ownership is not over.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Joe Sakic, center of the the Colorado Avalanche
hockey team, whose games are carried on a regional Fox network. In
1997, when the New York Rangers offered $21 million for Sakic, the
Denver-region Fox Sports Net effectively provided the cash for the
Avalanche to make a competing bid by extending the team's cable
contract and committing $15 million for construction of a new
arena. Sakic remained in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   It might have seemed as if Murdoch were an old-time movie mogul,
angling to keep a star within his studio. But in fact it was simply
further evidence of Fox's remote control over cable sports.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Semiconductors in the 1970s. Software in the 1980s.
Biotechnology in 1991. The Internet in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly once a decade, as some emerging technology reaches
critical mass, start-up companies rush to cash in on the ensuing
enthusiasm by selling their stock to the public.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, where nothing succeeds like excess, investment
bankers take a Darwinian view of these frenzies, pushing as many
companies as possible through the financing process while the
public's appetite is whetted but before it is sated.
</P>
<P>
   This year, it is a feast. The eager Internet start-ups are so
numerous that investment banks tell of having to turn away
potential clients while some companies have resorted to trying
creative methods to whisk their documents through regulatory
approvals. A company might list itself in the transportation
industry, for example, if it plans to sell airline tickets over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a midsummer market collapse, more than 100 newly public
companies might be competing for the attention of investors before
the usual August break of investment bankers, the finance
professionals say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've certainly seen other booms, but we've never seen
anything like this,'' said Kenneth R. Fitzsimmons, director of
capital markets at BancBoston Robertson Stephens, the San Francisco
firm that has been one of the biggest underwriters of Internet
stock offerings in the last six months. ``The market is far more
frenetic, and companies are getting higher absolute valuations than
ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   The bankers typically scrutinize a company's financial condition
and business plan, and they promise to provide coverage of the
stock once trading starts.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with past frenzies, this one is extreme in several
ways. Internet-related businesses already account for a bigger
portion of the total number of new issues than biotechnology
companies ever did, and these new stocks are rising higher and
faster than anything in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   While individual investors and day traders are contributing to
the activity, institutional investors like mutual and pension funds
are also eagerly chasing companies that many of them would have
previously dismissed as speculative. Those big investors, ever
mindful of investors' high expectations, are holding onto their
shares longer, dampening supply and reinforcing the upward rise of
many Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   All this interest is putting some strains on the
initial-offering system, which usually steers the public's money
only to the most promising companies. Jesus Cabrera, who oversees
the State Street Emerging Growth fund, says so many Internet
companies are jockeying to go public that he cannot make it to all
the ``road shows,'' the presentations at which company managers and
their bankers use to describe the company's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   His solution: Watch some of the road shows over the Internet, on
a service called Netroadshow.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I place value in meeting companies in person so I can see the
whites of their eyes,'' Cabrera said. ``But if I tried to go to
them all, I wouldn't have a life,'' or much time to manage a $100
million mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   Portfolio managers might take comfort in knowing that it has
been hard to lose money investing in an Internet public offering in
the last year. The point was driven home again on Friday, when
shares of USInternetworking, iTurf and Extreme Networks each jumped
more than 100 percent from their offering prices in their first day
of trading.
</P>
<P>
   Such leaps are typical of the more than two dozen
Internet-related companies that have completed initial offerings so
far in 1999, and an improvement over the performance of similar
offerings last year. Fitzsimmons said his research shows that
Internet offerings jumped nearly 70 percent, on average, in their
first day of trading last year.
</P>
<P>
   According to Thomson Financial Securities Data, a quarter of the
initial public offerings so far this year have been for
Internet-related companies, up from less than 10 percent last year.
In 1991, when biotechnology companies were all the rage, those
concerns represented about 20 percent of new issues.
</P>
<P>
   The $9.4 billion raised in all types of new public offerings in
the first quarter of this year was a record, leading many on Wall
Street to believe that 1999 could follow the path set in 1991, when
a hot market for biotechnology offerings led to a record year for
underwriters.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, meanwhile, have shrugged at high-profile deals that
in past years would have dominated headlines.
</P>
<P>
   On March 30, Pepsi Bottling, the largest bottler and seller of
Pepsi products, completed the largest initial public offering this
year by selling $2.3 billion of its shares at $23 apiece. The
shares sank more than a point their first day of trading and have
since fallen further, closing at $21.4375 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Delphi Automotive, which makes auto components and systems, sold
$1.7 billion of shares at $17 apiece in early February. Though the
shares have spent most of their time at $18 or more, they have
recently slipped to less than the offering price, closing at
$17.4375 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current IPO market is significantly more concentrated in
one sector than I've ever seen it,'' said Scott Sipprelle, a
co-founder of the Midtown Research Group, which tracks initial
offerings, and the former head of the equity capital markets
division of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   That might be diverting money away from promising companies in
other industries. Global Markets Access, an insurer based in
Hamilton, Bermuda, had planned to raise $244 million in an initial
offering to be underwritten by Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and Prudential
Securities but withdrew its offering on March 31, citing market
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly is straining the lives of bankers, lawyers,
accountants, printers and others who keep the IPO machine running.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never been this busy, and we're turning things down,''
said Fitzsimmons of BancBoston Robertson Stephens. While the firm's
committee that reviews underwritings has always rejected some deals
because of poor quality, ``we're having to pick and choose the
deals we do much more now,'' he said, citing the high volume.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps of greatest concern to investors, however, is the
relative shortage of analysts who understand and can follow the
Internet companies once they begin trading. There is an almost
endless supply of potential Internet companies _ which are often
little more than a business plan and some financial projections.
But few analysts can make sense of both Internet technology and the
economic models that will lead to success on the new medium.
</P>
<P>
   David Readerman, a software and Internet analyst at Thomas
Weisel Partners, a San Francisco investment bank, notes that while
nearly every investment bank has at least two or three bankers
working on Internet-related offerings, they have one securities
analyst, at most, to follow the companies once the stock is
trading.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   Analysts will play a far more important role in following
Internet companies, Readerman said, than they did in, say, the
biotechnology boom. In the Food and Drug Administration,
biotechnology companies had, an outsider to rule on their products'
ultimate success or failure. But determining the prospects of an
Internet company is more prophesy and conjecture.
</P>
<P>
   People involved in bringing Internet companies to market also
complain of a bottleneck at the Securities and Exchange Commission,
which must review a company's disclosure documents before granting
approval to sell shares.
</P>
<P>
   Investment bankers say the initial review, which is supposed to
be completed within 30 days, is taking closer to six weeks. Chris
Ullman, an SEC spokesman, denied that backlog; he said that while
the average time for review of a filing for initial public
offerings had recently been 31 to 33 days, it has now returned to
30 days.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley there is talk that the fastest way to get an
Internet business to market is to pretend it's not an Internet
company. When companies register with the SEC, the documents are
initially routed within the agency to industry experts based on the
company's Standard Industrial Classification code, a four-digit
number indicating the industry in which the company does business.
</P>
<P>
   Investment bankers and other Wall Street professionals say that
companies have recently been tweaking their industry codes to avoid
the queues numbered in the 7370's, which denotes computer systems
and software.
</P>
<P>
   That queue has been used by a wide variety of companies,
including Priceline.com, which sells discounted airline tickets
over the Internet. But two other companies in a similar business _
Lowestfare.com and Cheap Tickets Inc. _ used the codes for
transportation services and general business services,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Ullman said that whatever code a company initially files under,
the SEC will determine the correct industry and route the filing
accordingly. In other words, he advised companies, don't try it.
</P>
<P>
   Companies still cannot get their offerings to the market quickly
enough, in part because they fear missing the opportunity before
the financing window closes.
</P>
<P>
   Investment managers, on the other hand, cannot seem to buy
quickly enough, showing little regard for the outsized valuations
at which Internet companies are going public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had lunch with a mutual fund manager the other day and asked
if he'd played in these Internet IPO's,'' said L. Keith Mullins,
who tracks small companies at Salomon Smith Barney. ``He said he
had, so I asked if he could give me a fundamental reason to own any
of these stocks at these prices. He said no. But he added, `That's
what's working right now.'''
</P>
<P>
   George S. Shirk III, managing editor of the New Issues
newsletter, said his publication has recommended that investors
``flip,'' or sell on the first day of trading, nearly every
Internet IPO that has come to market this year _ provided that an
investor can get shares at the initial offering price, as
institutions can but individuals usually cannot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not seeing a lot that we would recommend for a long-term
investor,'' he said, particularly after trading begins and the
stock has already more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Though individual investors may be left out of the earliest part
of the game, institutions are jumping into deals that, in the
not-so-distant past, would have drawn little enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demand by institutional investors has gotten much higher
because those managers want to show these stocks in their
portfolios at the end of each quarter,'' said Linda Killian, who
herself manages a mutual fund that invests in new offerings, the
IPO Plus Aftermarket fund.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the quality of the companies coming public has
deteriorated is a matter of opinion. A decade ago, only rarely
could a company go public without a record of sales growth from
three to five years and at least some profits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, though, about a third of the companies completing
initial offerings were losing money, Ms. Killian said. Today, a
similar portion have virtually no sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if you are simplistic about it and look at traditional
measures, you'd have to say that the quality has plunged,'' she
said. ``But if you look at it in a different way, maybe not.
Hindsight will be a great teacher.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Rain showers will fall in the deserts of the Southwest Monday as
a storm system associated with the southern branch of the jet
stream churns eastward. A few peals of thunder will accompany the
afternoon showers. Snow will fall in the mountains of Arizona and
southern Utah with several inches possible above 6,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   A warm front associated with the Southwest low will surge toward
the Rio Grande River, preceded by a band of rain and thunderstorms.
A few of the storms may turn severe in the afternoon across central
and western Texas as winds changing direction with height increase
the likelihood for supercells. Large hail and isolated tornadoes
are possible. Farther north, patches of rain will break out in
western Kansas and eastern Colorado as moist winds ascend the
sloping terrain.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, high pressure will promote tranquil conditions from
the Mississippi Valley to the Deep South, including Florida. Ample
sunshine and mild air will grace the region.
</P>
<P>
   Very cool air will enter the Northeast and Middle Atlantic
States in the wake of departing low pressure. Rain will fall in the
early morning along the coast from Cape Cod to the Delmarva
Peninsula while scattered showers of rain and snow will develop
over the Appalachians of New York and Pennsylvania as a pocket of
cold air aloft moves overhead.
</P>
<P>
   A weak storm will bring rain to coastal areas of Washington and
Oregon, with snow likely in the Cascades above 5,000 feet.
Elsewhere, high pressure will ensure a sunny and dry day for
Northern California and the northern Rockies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Late Chill and Rain
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonably cold weather contributed to more than a dozen new
record minimums in southern California over the weekend. The lowest
readings occurred early Saturday in the high desert as the mercury
tumbled to 20 degrees at Idyllwild. Even the coast noted record
lows as Santa Barbara fell to 35 degrees. On Sunday, another potent
disturbance had descended on the region with a chill rain dampening
the shore and heavy wet snow, above 3,000 feet, in the mountains
around Los Angeles, perhaps tempering the effects of a serious
winter drought in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Extended Forecast Text for Monday, April 12
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Thursday: Sunshine in the Northeast will fade behind
increasing clouds as a storm approaches from the west. The
Southeast will be warmer and humid while thunderstorms rumble
through the Mississippi Valley. It will turn noticeably colder in
the Northern Plains as rain mixes with snow before ending in parts
of the area. It will be warmer in the Southwest, but still damp
along the Northwest Coast.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Saturday: A potent storm system will move into Eastern
Canada leaving behind rain or snow showers in the Great Lakes and
cooler air in the Northeast. Showers will linger in the Southeast
as a cold front stalls in northern Florida. The Middle West will be
cooler than average as sunshine makes a return. The Southwest will
be very warm with ample sunshine. While in the Northwest, a new
cold front will produce clouds and showers.  &QL;

WHICH WAY WOULD THEIR `WIND' BLOW? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Frankly, my dear, you can find someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Conroy, author of The Prince of Tides, has walked away from
a deal to write a second sequel to Margaret Mitchell's 1936 Gone
With the Wind after getting into a dispute with the executors of
her estate.
</P>
<P>
   Previous reports said Conroy would be paid about $10 million for
the book. St. Martin's Press, the publisher, is reported to have
paid $4.5 million to Mitchell's estate for the rights to the second
sequel. ''_ The Associated Press &QL; 
_To the editors of St. Martin's Press: Pat Conroy is not only
derelict but a traitor to his country, as well. You want a big
name? You got it. I would love to take over the book. It's my duty
as a writer and a patriot.
</P>
<P>
   Any red-blooded American can tell you that this demands to be a
story about weapons. Forget Rhett and Scarlett and that mushy love
garbage. The Civil War redefined weaponry, from the Gatling gun to
the ``Monitor'' and the ``Merrimac.'' The cluster of barrels on the
early machine gun; the low, flat deck, the heavy guns, the
revolving turrets of the ``Monitor.'' I tear up just thinking about
it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, I see in Rhett Butler a Jack Ryan-type hero _ the
star of endless sequels. Rhett Butler for president! And God bless
America! Patriotically yours, Tom Clancy.
</P>
<P>
   _Dear Editors: Pat Conroy was wrong from the start. You need a
writer to explore Rhett Butler for what he really is _ a sensuous
vampire.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain his derring-do as a blockade runner for the
Confederate Army? He didn't fear death _ because he was already
dead! It's also the reason he had to leave Tara _ undead, he sadly
feels at home nowhere. This also explains his supernatural appeal
to women, including, of course Scarlett _ scarlet, the color of
blood. Coincidence? I hardly think so. Sigh. Vivian Leigh would
have looked ``so'' good in Goth. Yours without garlic, Anne Rice. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dear Editors: Shame on Pat Conroy. What he needs to learn is
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   And frankly, so do Rhett and Scarlett. As anyone can see, these
two need to be punished for their antics. Three marriages for
Scarlett? Rhett abandons his wife _ and curses while doing so?
Sure, ``damn'' might not seem obscene, but in the same way
marijuana leads to heroin, this leads to dirtier words, including,
yes, the Big One. These losers need to take control of their lives,
and if they can't, they need to find someone who can.
</P>
<P>
   They need to find me. You owe it to yourselves and your readers
to let me write this book! Sanctimoniously yours, a fully clothed
Dr. Laura Schlessinger.
</P>
<P>
   _Dear editors: I am willing to leap into the void and write the
second sequel to ``Gone With the Wind.'' I see it shaping up as
something you might find surprising: a bloody horror story scarier
than ``Creepshow,'' with Scarlett O'Hara as a cruel sadist and
serial killer. Impossible? Perish the thought (pun, as always,
intended).
</P>
<P>
   Here's the pitch _ Scarlett, back on her feet, takes in poor and
needy people left destitute by the Civil War. Yet, ominously, they
are never seen again. Scared yet? We learn that there is a basement
in her home, and when one spunky, sexy female unfortunate _ think
Claire Danes _ leads other wretches into it, they are shocked to
find perfectly preserved heads of victims smiling at them. Scarlett
is in a dark corner, preserving another head, blood smeared all
over her, chanting incoherently, looking like Marilyn Manson. Does
our heroine escape? Read on.
</P>
<P>
   I'm perfect for the job, and _ I don't want to brag, but it's a
fact _ a ``lot'' of my books have been made into movies. Forget
critics. Pay attention to sales. Yours in telegraphed terror,
Stephen King.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Dear Editors: What we obviously have here is a Southern legal
thriller. Carpetbaggers, the financial ruin caused by the Civil
War? This was a world ripe for lawsuits. I see this as Rhett
Butler's revenge. His enemies keep showing up dead. Why? We'll find
out in court, once he's charged with murder _ murder he didn't
commit. The key to the crimes? Two words: tax laws. Throw in some
red herrings, unlikely romances and a chase scene or two and we've
get a best-seller! Litigiously yours, John Grisham. &QL;

RAUL SILVA HENRIQUEZ, CHILEAN CARDINAL WHO CHAMPIONED HUMAN RIGHTS,
DIES AT 91  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Chile, Argentina)   By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raul Cardinal Silva Henriquez, who led Roman Catholicism in
Chile for more than two decades, championing human rights and
sharply criticizing Gen. Augusto Pinochet's dictatorial regime,
died on Friday in a home for retired priests in Santiago, Chile. He
was 91.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, church officials said..
</P>
<P>
   He became bishop of Chile's great Pacific port, Valparaiso, in
1959 and archbishop of Santiago, the country's capital and largest
city, in 1961. He was elevated to the rank of cardinal by Pope John
XXIII in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   By 1963, the cardinal had become one of the foremost figures of
Latin America in campaigning for immediate sweeping reforms to
improve the lives of the masses. He retired in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet overthrew Chile's socialist president, Salvador
Allende, in a coup in 1973 and held power as the country's
president and dictator until 1990, after he lost a plebiscite. He
was succeeded as president by Patricio Aylwin, a member of Chile's
Christian Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Under the cardinal, the Chilean church made demands, during the
Pinochet years, for the return of democracy to Chile. When the
cardinal preached about the sacredness of human rights, worshipers
frequently cried out, ``Raul! Our friend, the people are with
you!''
</P>
<P>
   Despite death threats and other efforts at intimidations, the
cardinal also helped gather documentation about human rights
abuses, including torture, during the Pinochet era. He sponsored
efforts to help people who had lost their jobs because of political
persecution to get new ones. He also sponsored legal assistance for
political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   When an organization that the cardinal had set up to alleviate
the sufferings of victims of repression was broken up by the
Pinochet government, he founded a successor group that managed to
carry out similar activities.
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner in his home in 1985, he looked back on his attempts
from 1973 to 1983 to deter the Pinochet regime from its use of
terror.
</P>
<P>
   A guest at the dinner, the Rev. Robert F. Drinan, a professor of
law at Georgetown University and a former U.S. congressman, wrote
later that that the cardinal had ``concluded by saying that the
government's oppression of the church is as bad as persecution of
the church in the Roman Empire in the early centuries of
Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chile is harassing the church because, almost alone among
social institutions, it represents the tortured, the exiled, the
unemployed and the poor,'' Drinan wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal also played an important role in forestalling a war
in 1978 between Chile and its neighbor, Argentina. He is credited
with persuading both governments to consent to mediation of a
border dispute between them by Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   Silva Henriquez was born in Talca in central Chile, received a
law degree from Catholic University in Santiago and was ordained a
priest in 1938. From 1939 to 1959 he held a succession of
educational posts, and from 1951 to 1959 he concurrently headed a
charitable organizatin.

NEWCOMER CAUSES COMPETITION TO HEAT UP AMONG TRAVEL MAGAZINES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A nymphet in a clingy ski top gazing out from a chalet. A couple
locked in an embrace, backlit by the fingered rays of a Caribbean
sunset. A tanned woman in a white bikini walking a solitary line on
a Palau beach.
</P>
<P>
   These images _ those that grace the current covers of travel
magazines _ suggest a world of Zen serenity and connubial bliss.
</P>
<P>
   But with the economy roaring and consumers ready to spend
Dow-fattened travel dollars on summer vacations, the competition
for readers is hotter than for a round-the-world ticket on the
Concorde for New Year's Eve 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And 1998 brought a new foe. The two mainstay travel magazines _
Travel &AMP; Leisure and Conde Nast Traveler _ are dealing with a
feisty newcomer: Arthur Frommer's Budget Travel, a quarterly which
met with such newsstand success that it will be published bimonthly
starting September and, its publishers predict, monthly within the
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Its newsstand sales _ twice those of its larger cousins _ made
the stalwarts take note. But it was Frommer's editor's letter in
his premiere issue last summer that really stung.
</P>
<P>
   Frommer, who publishes a series of travel guidebooks, Arthur
Frommer's Travel Guides, proclaimed that the current crop of travel
magazines are inane, irrelevant, ``elitist, haughty and
high-society.'' He argued that 90 percent of the country cannot
afford to go on the vacations ``the glossy travel magazines''
espouse. They were in fact, ``a public scandal, a disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   And that hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was stupid and untrue,'' said Nancy Novogrod,
editor in chief of Travel &AMP; Leisure, which is produced by the
American Express publishing unit. ``It was graceless to attack us
in his first issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Hill, the publisher of Budget Travel, stood his magazine's
ground. ``We're not an armchair book,'' he retorted, using the term
aficionados use to refer to magazines intended for armchair
travelers and wishful thinkers. ``We're about real people.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as they acknowledged Frommer's shots, Travel &AMP; Leisure and
Conde Nast Traveler have so far tried to ignore his magazine and
have reasons to celebrate their own successes.
</P>
<P>
   Both have been nominated for National Magazine Awards this year.
Travel &AMP; Leisure has just published its largest issue ever, at 212
pages. Thomas J. Wallace, the editor in chief of Conde Nast
Traveler _ put out by the Conde Nast unit of Advance Publications _
has won four National Magazine Awards for General Excellence in the
last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Ad pages, as estimated by the Publishers Information Bureau, are
up in both, with Travel &AMP; Leisure weighing in at 1,552 for 1998, up
36.3 percent since 1994, and Traveler with 1,428, up 32.9 percent
since 1994. Travel &AMP; Leisure, though, often features advertising by
its parent corporation; in the April issue, for example, a 40-page
advertorial about Europe is sponsored by the American Express card.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most consumer magazines, travel magazines are almost
entirely dependent on subscriptions for circulation. Travel &AMP;
Leisure's circulation is the largest, at 1,013,327, according to
the Audit Bureau of Circulations, but its subscribers _ many of
whom are drawn from American Express card data bases _ make up 97
percent of that number; only 28,418 are sold on newsstands.
</P>
<P>
   Conde Nast Traveler is second, with a circulation of 766,338,
only 32,535 of which are newsstand sales. National Geographic
Traveler and Hachette-Filipacchi's Travel Holiday follow with
circulations of 715,437 and 558,610, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The Frommer magazine is not yet audited by the Audit Bureau of
Circulations. According to Hill, it outsells both Traveler and
Travel &AMP; Leisure on the newsstand, selling roughly 70,000 copies an
issue that way, of a total of about 350,000. Its newsstand appeal,
he said, is its budget-consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   What also rankles Frommer's magazine rivals is that he has
accused the entire category of the worst kind of collusion between
advertising and editorial: accepting free trips. Writers for the
competition, he wrote in his first editor's letter, ``get sent on
paid junkets and write rapturously of three-star restaurants and
deluxe hotels.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Travel &AMP; Leisure and Conde Nast Traveler said that
is not true. Arthur Frommer's publisher, Hill, conceded that while
expense-paid trips were out of the question at his magazine,
junkets _ organized trips for groups of journalists _ were not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not take `comps,''' Hill said, meaning that a writer for
Budget Travel would not travel for free on an individual vacation
for a specific story. He did, however, concede that ``an organized
press trip is a little bit different, but there's never a quid pro
quo for advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, the magazine's executive editor, Bill
McCoy, went to Poland on a junket at the expense of the Polish
tourism office earlier this year. When he decided to stay in Warsaw
for a few extra days, the magazine covered his expenses, but the
initial costs for his trip were covered by the tourism office _ a
practice neither Traveler nor Travel &AMP; Leisure say they allow.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Bellows, the editor in chief of National Geographic
Traveler, said that no writers on assignment may accept free trips,
but that editors may occasionally travel on press trips, paying
reduced rates so that they can familiarize themselves with a
destination.
</P>
<P>
   John Owen, editor of Travel Holiday, said his magazine spends
``hundreds of thousands of dollars'' a year to send writers and
photographers on assignment. ``Do we sometimes work with people to
get press rates? Sure. But we make the itineraries. It's not driven
by public relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Other publishers consider Frommer's approach hypocritical. Lisa
Henriques Hughes, who was named publisher of Conde Nast Traveler
two weeks ago, said Frommer's magazine could not be considered
uninterested in promoting certain destinations. ``He is not an
objective reporter, because he promotes travel guides,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hill dismissed the charge. ``Travel guidebooks are
nonadvertising-supported, and they are where you find the most
objective journalism,'' he said. ``The irony of her saying that is
that Arthur has made his reputation for 40 years by writing
guidebooks and being known as America's most objective critic of
travel.'' Hill added that Frommer is also not involved in the
day-to-day administration of the guidebooks.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hughes also criticized Travel &AMP; Leisure. ``They are owned by
the largest travel-related services company in the world,'' she
said, ``so by definition they are not objective.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Kelly, publisher of Travel &AMP; Leisure, said the American
Express connection helps market the magazine, but has no effect on
content. For all he cared, he said, ``Lisa can go back to selling
shower curtains,'' a reference to Ms. Hughes' recent stretch as
publisher of Conde Nast's House &AMP; Garden.

<P>
   Tax returns from Americans earning more than $100,000 a year and
from the biggest corporations are increasingly escaping the
scrutiny of the Internal Revenue Service, new agency figures show.
</P>
<P>
   Just one of every 60 high-income tax returns was audited last
year, compared with a rate of one in nine in 1988, according to IRS
data analyzed by Syracuse University researchers. Among the 8,500
largest companies, slightly more than one in three companies were
audited last year, down from two out of three in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   While audit rates overall have fallen substantially since 1986,
some tax experts and former IRS officials are worried that the
decline in high-income and corporate audits may mean that reporting
by many of the richest taxpayers is now effectively on an honor
system, inviting abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the investments and deductions used by such taxpayers,
these critics note, are not subject to the kinds of reporting
required of employers, banks, mortgage lenders and others, which
must pass along information on income and potential deductions to
the IRS. And for the less affluent, of course, the bulk of income
taxes are withheld from paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fewer traffic policemen you have, the more chances people
are going to take,'' said Donald C. Alexander, a Washington tax
lawyer who was IRS commissioner in the Nixon administration. ``And
as people find that their neighbors are not paying their fair
share, they are encouraged to not pay their share, either.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRS contends that sufficient audits were conducted last
year. The assistant commissioner for audits, Tom Smith, said that
increased financial reporting requirements by employers and others,
combined with changes in tax law, had reduced the need to audit
wage earners, while other strategies, such as tip-reporting
agreements with restaurant owners, lower the need for audits, too.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in audit rates began in 1968 but accelerated in
1995, after Congress, by then controlled by Republicans, cut IRS
spending sharply and required the agency to devote more resources
to customer service. Republicans characterized the IRS as an agency
that was out of control and that was intruding far too deeply into
the lives of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, the IRS has reduced the hours it spends auditing tax
returns by 27 percent for individuals and 12 percent for
corporations, according to the new data.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, overall audit rates fell to record lows last year.
Of the 120 million individual tax returns, only one in 217 was
audited, down 36 percent from 1994. During the same period, the
number of returns reflecting incomes of $100,000 and up grew 62
percent, to six million.
</P>
<P>
   The audit data also show the reversal of a trend that emerged a
few years ago in which audits rose for the lowest-income Americans,
those making less than $25,000. Last year, one in 370 such returns
was audited, down from one in 178 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela F. Olson, a tax lawyer with the law firm of Weil, Gotshal
&AMP; Manges in Washington who is a former chairwoman of the American
Bar Association's tax section, said she was neither surprised nor
troubled by the drop in overall audit rates, given the increased
reporting required of employers, lenders and others. She said that
large, publicly traded companies also get sufficient scrutiny, not
only from the IRS but from independent auditors and the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But like a number of other tax experts, Ms. Olson said that the
IRS was paying too little attention to privately owned businesses.
``They have not gotten much in the way of audit coverage, and this
is where there is lots of room to play games,'' she said, largely
by owners charging personal expenses to the company.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS has long audited sole proprietors closely, but critics
say that small and medium-size corporations and their owners and
executives get less scrutiny. Some IRS officials have also
acknowledged privately that opportunities remain for underreporting
capital gains, which are subject to fewer formal checks than are
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Several tax experts said the new data raised troubling questions
about the equity of the tax system.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will the impact of this shift in audit policy have on
people's long-term faith in our tax system, on people feeling that
others are paying their fair share and I should pay my fair
share?'' asked Susan Long, co-director of Syracuse University's
Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, which obtained the IRS
data.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An audit is begun for many different reasons. In many cases, an
IRS scoring system has identified deductions or other factors on a
return as being far outside statistical norms. Increasingly, the
IRS is picking specific occupations for audits to gather data about
tax-paying patterns. The agency is also selecting more returns for
auditing because of suspicions about the tax preparer whose name is
on the return or because of referrals from other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Audits about simple issues are often handled through the mail,
with taxpayers being asked to justify or explain a line on their
tax return. For more serious questions, taxpayers are asked to come
to the IRS, or an examiner visits their home or business to inspect
records and ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   The agency can refer cases for prosecution if there is evidence
of tax evasion, tax fraud or a variety of nontax crimes, including
money laundering, drug dealing and racketeering. It referred 3,990
cases to the Justice Department last year, down 21 percent from
5,078 in 1993, the clearinghouse said.
</P>
<P>
   Only 514 people were convicted of tax evasion or tax fraud in
1997, down from 594 in 1993, according to the data the
clearinghouse obtained from the Justice Department. Justice
officials cautioned that the actual number of such convictions
might be more or less than the figures in its data base, but they
did not dispute that the number of such cases was small and
decreasing.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecution of tax cheats, long a minor government activity, has
shrunk even more since 1994, other data collected by the
clearinghouse show. Last year, just 766 people were prosecuted for
federal tax crimes, according to data that the administrative
office of U.S. courts gave to the clearing house.
</P>
<P>
   Long said the data make a case for more aggressive prosecution
of scofflaws. ``If you are involved in large-scale cheating on your
taxes and all you have to do, if you are caught, is pay the money
and some penalty,'' she said, ``it is almost a reward.''
</P>
<P>
   The new IRS audit data cover the period through last Sept. 30.
In the past, publicly disclosed data on IRS enforcement efforts
were typically at least two years old. The fresh data were turned
over to the clearinghouse by Charles O. Rossotti, the computer
industry executive who became IRS commissioner last year.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this data, including details on incomes by state and
county, is available on the Internet at http://trac.syr.edu/
without charge. The clearinghouse also maintains a World Wide Web
site with more detailed information that it sells by subscription.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexicans were expecting the governor of the state
of Chiapas to mobilize hundreds of troops to impose his will and to
teach a lesson to the Zapatista rebels who brazenly defied his
authority last week.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen did a conciliatory
about-face that may signal a major change in government policy
toward the Zapatista insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown was over San Andres Larrainzar, an Indian village
in the Chiapas highlands taken over by Zapatista supporters in late
1995. On Thursday, state police swooped in and took it back,
installing a mayor from Albores' party, the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the loss of a village that is hallowed ground to
them, the Zapatistas reacted in less than 24 hours. More than 1,000
rebel sympathizers, their faces covered with ski masks and
bandannas, drove the police away from the town hall on Friday and
reoccupied it. No one was hurt, but several police patrol cars were
damaged.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, Albores announced unexpectedly that he was
going to use ``patience and politics'' instead of force to resolve
the dispute. He canceled arrest warrants that police were preparing
against the Zapatistas who led the retaking of the town hall and
ordered the police to withdraw from the town.
</P>
<P>
   Albores named several top officials of the state government to
open negotiations with the Zapatistas to try to resolve the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Later on Saturday _ the 80th anniversary of the death of
Emiliano Zapata, the peasant farmer revolutionary from whom the
Zapatistas take their name _ thousands of rebel supporters gathered
in the rustic central square in San Andres Larrainzar for a noisy
fiesta to celebrate their winning gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Many had expected an armed battle with government forces to
defend their control of a village that is an internationally known
symbol of their movement because it was the site of peace talks
with the government three years ago. The talks produced a partial
accord and then collapsed in late 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround in Chiapas in recent days came during a visit to
Mexico of Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada, a member along
with Mexico and the United States of the North American Free Trade
Agreement. President Ernesto Zedillo pledged publicly to Chretien
to resolve the Chiapas confrontation peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   But a year ago, on another day of Zapatista festivities marking
their hero's holiday, Albores dispatched police and army troops to
break up a rebel administration and to arrest its leaders in an
Indian town similar to San Andres Larrainzar. The operation was
part of a string of government actions in 1998 to destroy Zapatista
town governments, which raised tensions in Chiapas to a boil not
seen since the Zapatistas' brief armed uprising in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have to fight among ourselves,'' Albores told a
happy crowd of pro-government Indians gathered to hear his most
recent announcement in a town right next to San Andres Larrainzar.
</P>
<P>
   Later Saturday, he planted a new white flag in a square directly
in front of the main cathedral in the Chiapas highlands, in the
city of San Cristobal de las Casas. He rechristened the square,
which until recently was a site for Zapatista political rallies,
The Plaza of Peace.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop presiding in the cathedral is Samuel Ruiz Garcia, who
has made no secret of his support for the Zapatistas' principles _
although not their armed tactics _ and has carried on a feud with
Albores. Ruiz did not take part in the flag ceremony.

IN THE MOVE FROM WELFARE TO WORK, MANY PEOPLE LOSE HEALTH
INSURANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., N.J., Conn., Texas, Pa., Calif., Ariz., R.I., Md.,
Mich.)  (js) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hundreds of thousands of low-income people have
lost health insurance as an unintended consequence of the 1996
welfare law, federal and state officials and health policy experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   The law created strong incentives for people to move from
welfare to work, and in theory, most people who worked their way
off welfare were supposed to be able to keep their Medicaid
coverage. But in practice, many people leaving welfare have lost
Medicaid and become uninsured, health care experts say.
</P>
<P>
   State officials, who administer welfare and Medicaid,
acknowledge that they have not always complied with the
requirements of federal law intended to preserve Medicaid for
people losing cash assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Many welfare recipients have taken low-wage jobs with no health
benefits. Even when employers offer benefits, low-wage workers are
often unable to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, President Clinton's decision to sign the 1996 welfare law
has unexpectedly undermined his goal of increasing the number of
Americans with health insurance _ a goal shared by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John H. Chafee, R-R.I., the main author of the provision of
the law meant to preserve health benefits for people who lose cash
assistance, said: ``I'm deeply concerned about the reports I've
heard that people are losing their Medicaid coverage. This directly
contradicts the intent of the 1996 welfare law and could very well
undermine states' future success in helping people become
self-sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Stan Dorn, director of the Health Consumer Alliance, a consumer
help group for low-income people in California, said: ``We are
seeing substantial losses in Medicaid coverage resulting directly
from welfare reform, despite the best intentions of Congress to
make sure that did not happen. The administration hopes its legacy
will be expanded health insurance coverage for children. But the
unintended fallout of welfare reform threatens to swamp the
significant benefits of new legislation to cover children.''
</P>
<P>
   Since early 1998, Clinton has repeatedly urged state officials
to seek out children who are eligible for Medicaid but not
enrolled, and he says there are at least 4 million of them. Even as
some state health officials try to find these children, other state
employees, in the same or different agencies, are denying or
stopping Medicaid for many low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that some welfare recipients might lose health
insurance was recognized in 1996. But in the last month, several
authoritative studies _ by the Rockefeller Institute of government
in Albany, N.Y., the Center for Health Policy Research at George
Washington University and the Urban Institute _ have documented the
pervasive problem.
</P>
<P>
   On March 22, the secretary of health and human services, Donna
E. Shalala, sent a sternly worded letter to state officials
reminding them of their statutory obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law says that when a state cuts off a family's welfare
payments because of increased earnings, it must include a Medicaid
card or other document authorizing the family to continue receiving
Medicaid. This law, adopted in 1988, was strengthened by the 1996
law, which provided additional protection for people losing welfare
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   State officials boast that they have transformed the culture and
philosophy of welfare agencies, so they now focus on finding jobs
rather than issuing checks. Besides cutting off Medicaid for many
people who find jobs, some caseworkers have erroneously told poor
people that they must search for work as a precondition for getting
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1996 law, people who received cash assistance were
automatically enrolled in Medicaid, and many welfare recipients
said they stayed on welfare to keep their health insurance.
Congress severed the link between the two programs in 1996, but
federal officials said there was still a widespread perception that
Medicaid eligibility depended on whether a person received welfare.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 law requires most welfare recipients to work as a
condition of getting cash assistance, sets a five-year limit on the
receipt of federal welfare benefits and imposes many other
restrictions on cash welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon K. Smith, a former Medicaid director in Michigan who has
studied the interaction between welfare and Medicaid nationwide,
said: ``Many people believe incorrectly that the tough new welfare
policies apply to Medicaid. The stigma associated with welfare is
often attached to Medicaid as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt D. Salo, a health policy expert at the National Governors'
Association, said it was difficult for caseworkers to reconcile two
contradictory messages implicit in the 1996 law: ``Medicaid is
good, everyone should stay on Medicaid. But welfare is bad,
everyone should stay off welfare.''

</P>
<P>
   In New York, the number of people on Medicaid has dropped by
265,348, or 9 percent, since Clinton signed the welfare law in
August 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Frances E. Tarlton, a spokeswoman for the New York state Health
Department, said: ``We are concerned about the drop in the Medicaid
rolls. People who no longer qualify for cash assistance need to be
informed that they are still probably eligible for Medicaid and
should sign up for it. But for some reason, we are not seeing this
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, a federal district judge ruled that New York City
had improperly denied applications for Medicaid from needy
individuals, on the ground that they had failed to comply with the
work requirements of the city's welfare program. The city has vowed
to improve its procedures, but the plaintiffs say the city's plans
are inadequate. The judge will hear arguments this month.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, the number of people on Medicaid has declined by
54,261, or 8 percent. In Connecticut, which made a major effort to
find eligible people, the number enrolled in Medicaid rose by
3,258, or 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon, the number of Medicaid recipients has dropped by
43,000, or 11 percent. In Texas, it has dropped by 306,890, or 15
percent, even though the state has expanded eligibility for
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people on Medicaid has dropped by 213,614, or 13
percent, in Pennsylvania; by 453,640, or 8 percent, in California,
and by 58,899, or 4 percent, in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Redmond, health director of Philadelphia Citizens for
Children and Youth, a child advocacy group, said: ``When parents
leave welfare for work, they and their children still qualify for
Medicaid. That's the theory. In reality, it often doesn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time after time, children and parents who are legally entitled
to Medicaid end up without it because of misinformation and
burdensome reporting requirements. The main message they hear is,
`Go to work.' They are not told what they need to do to keep their
Medicaid.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White
House, said there were ``unacceptable barriers'' to getting and
keeping Medicaid in some states. ``It isn't necessarily
intentional,'' he said, ``but it has the same effect. People lose
out on access to affordable coverage they desperately need.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Diane Ross, assistant director of the Arizona Medicaid program,
said: ``When people get a job, they think they're not eligible for
welfare or medical assistance, so they don't seek a redetermination
of their eligibility for Medicaid. They just call and drop out of
both programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The coverage available to people leaving welfare is sometimes
called transitional Medicaid, because it helps them make the
transition from welfare to work. When welfare rolls shrink, as they
have in most states, the number of people using this form of
Medicaid would be expected to increase. But that does not always
happen.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, the number of people getting both welfare and
Medicaid dropped by 45 percent, to 81,106 last month from 147,890
in August 1996. But contrary to the expectations of state
officials, the number of Arizonans with transitional Medicaid fell
in the same period, to 19,105 from 23,426.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding who gets Medicaid, states must use eligibility
criteria at least as generous as those in effect in July 1996, just
before passage of the welfare law. Families with incomes low enough
to qualify for Medicaid under the old standards are thus supposed
to be eligible today, regardless of whether they receive welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Congress provided $500 million to help states carry out the
Medicaid provisions of the 1996 law. States can use the money, for
example, to hire workers to determine who is eligible for Medicaid
and to help people enroll. But states have used less than 10
percent of the money, the government says.
</P>
<P>
   Some counties in California have long lists of former welfare
recipients waiting to have their Medicaid eligibility re-evaluated.
``The state has not given us clear instructions or correct forms,''
said Darlene D. Landis, the eligibility director for the local
Department of Health and Human Services in Inyo County, Calif.
``Our computers are not ready yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Czapanskiy, a law professor at the University of Maryland,
said she and her students had represented many welfare recipients
who were deprived of Medicaid when they lost welfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, if our clients get jobs, they call their
caseworkers to stop cash benefits,'' Ms. Czapanskiy said. ``The
caseworker rarely mentions that transitional medical assistance is
available. Or the caseworker requires extraordinarily burdensome
documentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Martin P. Wasserman, the secretary of health and mental
hygiene in Maryland, acknowledged that this could happen.
``Sometimes,'' he said, ``as you're going through the busy pace of
the day, if somebody calls in and says, `I'm going off welfare,'
the eligibility worker doesn't have a chance to explain that
Medicaid and other benefits are still available.''

TAMPA BAY EARNS TOP SLOT IN DRAFT SKILLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They couldn't convince Bo Jackson to play on their team. And
they couldn't develop Vinny Testaverde into a playmaker. They
traded away the fourth overall pick in the 1979 draft for Chicago
Bears defensive end Wally Chambers, who lasted two seasons. They
traded away the first overall pick in the 1984 draft for Cincinnati
Bengals quarterback Jack Thompson, who lasted 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   It is no coincidence that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers endured 11
consecutive double digit-loss seasons. They annually made a mess of
the college draft, throwing darts and completely missing the board.
Of their 11 top-10 first-round picks from 1980 to 1993, just one _
linebacker Hugh Green _ made the Pro Bowl as a Buccaneers player.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with a change in philosophy and the promotion of Rich McKay
to general manager in 1995, the Buccaneers have become experts in
the art of the draft. Over the past five years, Tampa Bay has
drafted better than any other team in the NFL, according to a
formula, admittedly unscientific, devised by the Star-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, the Tampa Bay franchise focused too much on
potential and not enough on a guy's production in college, and when
you do that, you keep having busts in the draft,'' McKay said. ``We
had a small scouting department, and we weren't even computerized.
In some ways, it's like this franchise skipped the 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   McKay's system has certainly proven its worth. The Bucs have
strung together back-to-back nonlosing seasons for the first time
since 1981-82.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Buccaneers have found a formula they like, there's
no consensus on how to draft. Tampa Bay, for instance, relies
heavily on its scouts. The Miami Dolphins, who finished eighth in
the Star-Telegram's study, rely much more heavily than most teams
on input from their assistant coaches. Some teams consistently
draft for need. Others target the best player/athlete available,
regardless of need.
</P>
<P>
   Yet talks with several general managers and scouting directors
revealed a few common threads among teams that draft well. Teams
that consistently hit on draft day are usually directed by a keen
talent evaluator; they hoard as many draft picks as possible,
increasing the odds of drafting a superstar, even in late rounds,
and they have luck on their side.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs have had all that.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a system that heavily awards points for drafting
All-Pros, Pro Bowlers and team leaders in major statistical
categories, the Buccaneers scored 80 points in the Star-Telegram's
study to beat second-place New England (75). The top 10 was rounded
out by Jacksonville (69), Tennessee (68), St. Louis (62), Green Bay
(62), Cincinnati (62), Miami (60), Minnesota (57) and Denver (53).
The Cowboys, whose past two drafts have helped take the sting out
of dismal 1994 and 1995 drafts, finished 15th with 48 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a whole lot of magic to drafting,'' Cowboys
scouting director Larry Lacewell said. ``People know who can play
and who can't play.'' \Nsubheds:Adopting a plan Before Malcolm
Glazier bought the Buccaneers in 1995, Tampa Bay was a team that
relied heavily on input from tenured assistant coaches to make
draft-day decisions, McKay said. With five head coaches and five
new coaching staffs in 11 years from 1984-1994, the evaluation of
talent was inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   That had all changed by the time McKay, already the club's vice
president of football administration, was put in charge of the
Bucs' personnel department. In 1992, the Bucs hired Tim Ruskell as
the director of college scouting along with two additional college
scouts and two additional pro scouts. Their directive: Concentrate
on players who had highly productive college careers, regardless of
their size or speed. The symbolic results: The Bucs took linebacker
Derrick Brooks in the first round in 1995 and running back Warrick
Dunn in the first round two years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody acknowledged that Derrick Brooks was great in
college, but half the teams were afraid of taking him because of
his size,'' said McKay of Brooks who, at 6 feet tall, is four
inches smaller than the typical pro linebacker. ``We thought that
if Derrick was that good in school, and he was a first-team All
America, then he'd be great in the NFL. Same with Warrick Dunn. A
small guy \R5-8, 178\S. But all he did was produce in college
\Rcareer rushing leader at Florida State\S. Had we been concerned
about their size, we'd have missed out on two Pro Bowlers. We're
not looking for the fastest 40 \Ryard dash\S times. We're looking
for the best football players.''
</P>
<P>
   It no doubt helped McKay take a first-round risk on Brooks when
he has two first-round picks, which the Buccaneers had in 1995,
1996, and 1997. This hoarding of draft picks through trades has
long been the way that Jimmy Johnson operates, first as Cowboys
head coach, and now as the Dolphins coach.
</P>
<P>
   In his first two years with the Dolphins, Johnson drafted a
league-high 26 players. Johnson's philosophy? The more players you
draft, the better your chances of hitting on a potential star. This
strategy brought eight starters in 1996-1997, including All-Pro
linebacker Zach Thomas in the fifth round of the 1996 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is generally regarded as one of the best evaluators of
talent in the league, having drafted two starters in seven of his
eight drafts as a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Yet other personnel directors have proven to have sharp eyes for
talent.
</P>
<P>
   New England vice president of personnel Bobby Grier and
then-Patriots coach Bill Parcells drafted four Pro Bowlers and four
other starters from 1994-96.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville head coach Tom Coughlin and player personnel
director Rick Reiprish built the nucleus of their roster by finding
seven starters in the Jaguars' first two drafts.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay general manager Ron Wolf spends four days a week on
college campuses during football season watching first-hand the
players who would go in the next draft. Wolf and former Packers
coach Mike Holmgren parlayed a great working relationship to draft
12 players who started at least half the time in Green Bay from
1994-97.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time when I'm on the road it is an escape,'' said
Wolf, who has been scouting players since 1963 when he was a talent
scout with the Oakland Raiders. \Nsubheds:Blind luck Despite all of
the planning, there is still a great amount of luck involved in
drafting well.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Randy Moss was regarded as the best wide receiver
to come out of college since Jerry Rice. Yet his stock dropped in
the first round last year because he served some jail time for an
assault and was kicked out of Florida State for marijuana use.
Minnesota took Moss with the 21st pick, and he became the first
rookie first-team All Pro since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Dungy was the defensive coordinator of the Vikings in 1995
when his club passed on defensive tackle Warren Sapp with the 11th
pick because Sapp had flunked a drug test at the University of
Miami. Dungy was named Buccaneers head coach two years later. No
doubt Dungy is glad his new team had drafted Sapp with the 12th
pick in the 1995 draft because he has made the past two Pro Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Broncos were just looking for a ``camp guy,'' when
they drafted Terrell Davis with their sixth pick in the 1995 draft.
Davis had a non-descript career at Long Beach State and the
University of Georgia. He turned his chance in Denver into a
2,000-yard season, a regular-season MVP, and a Super Bowl MVP.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsey Levens transferred from Notre Dame to Georgia Tech. He
was the Packers second fifth-round pick in 1994. Given the primary
starting role with a season-ending injury to Edgar Bennett in 1996,
Levens first helped lead the Packers to a Super Bowl title, and in
1997, he became the first Packers Pro Bowl running back since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   There were 200 players drafted in 1994 before the Falcons spent
a seventh-round pick on Jamal Anderson out of Utah. Anderson slowly
worked his way into the starting lineup. Last year, he rushed for
an NFC-high 1,846 yards, and was the catalyst in the Falcons' first
Super Bowl appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, you just stumble on the right guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't call somebody smart for drafting an All-Pro in the
lower rounds,'' said Lacewell, whose club drafted All-Pro lineman
Larry Allen in the second round of the 1994 draft, and Pro Bowler
Leon Lett in the seventh round of the 1991 draft. ``If anybody knew
that somebody like Terrell Davis would be that good, they would
have drafted him in the first round. Give those teams credit for
drafting those players, though. You make the most of what you
got.''
</P>
<P>
   Some teams make more than others.

RANGERS SAVING NHL FROM SEEDING FIASCO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Gary Bettman and his boys at the NHL offices have any class,
they'll send the New York Rangers a big Thank You present.
</P>
<P>
   By falling apart in the final month of the season, the Rangers
prevented what could have been one of the most heated debates in
sports this year _ the possibility of the Carolina Hurricanes
making the playoffs with the ninth-best record in the Eastern
Conference while the Rangers sat home with the eighth-best record.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost too bad the Rangers weren't left out in the cold by
way of a rules technicality _ it might have forced the NHL to
address what obviously is an unfair system.
</P>
<P>
   In splitting the league into six divisions this season to
accommodate current and future expansion, the NHL fathers believed
it best to make a divisional championship worth something. So they
declared the division winners would be the top three seeds in each
conference and the remaining five spots would go to the
non-division winning teams with the best records.
</P>
<P>
   Give them credit for trying something new and for standing
behind their decision. The problem is, it doesn't work. It's bad
enough that the Hurricanes will take the third seed in the Eastern
Conference, despite the fact they'll likely finish with the
eighth-best record. Can you imagine, though, if the Rangers had
made a late-season surge, finished three or four points better than
the Hurricanes and still not made the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   There would have been outrage.
</P>
<P>
   There still should be.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing the Hurricanes to the third seed changes the entire
format of the Eastern Conference playoffs. It can be argued that
the sixth seed could actually have an easier first-round opponent
(the Hurricanes) than the top-seeded Ottawa Senators, who will face
either the Philadelphia Flyers, Buffalo Sabres or Boston Bruins.
How is that in any way fair?
</P>
<P>
   In the Western Conference, the Phoenix Coyotes stopped battling
weeks ago because they were slotted into the fourth playoff spot no
matter what. They were too far behind the Stars to catch up for
first place in the Pacific Division and too far ahead of the fifth
seed to care about dropping. Those were the only two options for
the Coyotes _ first or fourth _ despite the fact they and the Stars
were the two best teams in the Western Conference for much of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of a great race down the stretch to establish seeding
among the Coyotes, Detroit Red Wings and Colorado Avalanche,
Coyotes fans were treated to a month of boredom.
</P>
<P>
   The league believes these inequities are flukes, chance
happenings that likely won't occur again. But in just the first
season under this system, there are already two noticeable problems
with Carolina and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock suggests having two conferences, no
divisions and then adjusting the schedule to reflect natural
rivalries. Let the Stars play Detroit and Phoenix six or seven
times each and maybe see LA and Anaheim only three or four times
apiece. And make sure that each team gets to see teams from the
other conference at least two times in a season.
</P>
<P>
   That's one answer. There could be 50 more. The league says it
has no intention of making changes, but don't be surprised if a
general manager or two raises the issue this summer.
Focus on...Al MacInnis
MACINNIS GETTING NORRIS RESPECT THAT IS OVERDUE
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the fact that everyone is so in love with his booming
slapshot. Maybe it's the fact he's played in cities (Calgary and
St. Louis) that aren't media hotbeds. Maybe Al MacInnis has just
been overshadowed in his career by Norris Trophy hogs Ray Bourque
and Chris Chelios.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, the name Al MacInnis doesn't garner the
same respect when talk turns to ``the best defensemen in the NHL.''
But the 35-year-old rearguard for the Blues should change that this
season. He's the favorite to win the Norris Trophy, going away.
Bourque, the Red Wings' Nicklas Lidstrom and the Rangers' Brian
Leetch are all fighting for second place.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame that MacInnis is getting the hype now because he's
leading NHL defensemen in scoring with 20 goals and 38 assists. The
real reason Al MacInnis should be considered the best defenseman in
the NHL is because he's just that _ the perfect mix of defensive
responsibility with offensive prowess.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, he's the closest thing to Bourque (a five-time
Norris winner) the league has seen _ and a heck of a lot more than
just a guy who can shoot the puck 100 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the \Rreputation of the\S shot keeps me from winning the
Norris, there's nothing I can do about it,'' MacInnis said. ``But I
think the last couple of years, people have looked at me as more
than the shot. And this year, it seems more than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Slap Shots
</P>
<P>
   MUSH MOUTH
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Marchment, Reunion Arena's favorite whipping boy, isn't
going to endear himself to fans after considering a lawsuit against
the NHL in the wake of a one-game suspension for making an
``offensive comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Give the man they call Mush some credit, though, he's not
running away and hiding. After calling Vancouver Canucks winger
Donald Brashear, who is black, a ``big monkey,'' after a fight,
Marchment owned up to the statement and said he had no racist
intentions in making it. He said he calls all ``tough guys''
monkeys and is furious with the league for implying he might be
racist.
LINDROS UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   Eric Lindros was moved from a hospital in Nashville, Tenn., to a
hospital in Philadelphia to continue treatment on his collapsed
lung. Lindros will miss the first round of the playoffs and could
be out for the season.
</P>
<P>
   After the lung originally collapsed and filled with blood,
Lindros had three liters of blood drained. That's one and a half of
those big soda bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Expect Lindros, whose brother, Brett, had to quit hockey because
of postconcussion syndrome, to be extremely careful in making his
decision on when to return.
SAFETY SHIELDS
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks might be the hottest team in the NHL, but they're not
without controversy.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose could move all the way up to the fifth seed in the
Western Conference playoffs, but the reason they will is because of
goalie Steve Shields, who is supposed to be the team's backup.
Shields went on an 8-0-2 run while Mike Vernon was nursing a groin
injury, and now coach Darryl Sutter will have to choose between
Vernon and Shields in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   That could be particularly interesting if the Sharks play the
Red Wings, the team that traded Vernon after he won the Conn Smythe
Trophy two seasons ago.
BATTLE?
</P>
<P>
   The scribes in Alberta are having a hoot of a time making fun of
the fight between the Flames and Oilers for the final playoff spot
in the Western Conference. Once called the proud Battle of Alberta
between two teams considered the best in the league, the fight is
now labeled: ``The Crawl to the Ball.''
</P>
<P>
   AROUND THE LEAGUE
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Larry Robinson told the Los Angeles Times that he
might quit after this season. ``It's been a tough year. Even my
wife is finding it tough.'' Robinson's Kings have missed the
playoffs three out of four seasons and were swept in the first
round last season. ... The Predators have rejected the latest
contract proposal by the agent of David Legwand, who was taken
second overall in last year's draft. The Predators have the upper
hand in negotiations as Legwand could use another year in junior
hockey. ... The Blackhawks have been spectacular under new coach
Lorne Molleken and took the interim off his title last week. The
Blackhawks are 6-2-2 in their past 10 games, despite trading Chris
Chelios and losing Doug Gilmour to back surgery. ... Blues winger
Geoff Courtnall, who has missed 55 games with postconcussion
syndrome, is practicing again with the team. He said he'd like to
be ready for the playoffs. ... Jaromir Jagr has cemented the Hart
Trophy as league MVP. In games he has not played this season, the
Penguins have been lost. ... The Ducks are 1-10-3 lifetime at Joe
Louis Arena and are scared to death of facing the Red Wings in the
first round. ... Flames defenseman Steve Smith was cut with a skate
across the neck and had to have microsurgery to close some veins.
Smith said he has lost feeling on one side of his face. ... The Red
Wings are hoping recently acquired defenseman Ulf Samuelsson
(broken foot) can play his first game today against the Penguins.
\Nsubheds:THE WEEK AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday: Blues at Ducks _ Both teams fighting for right to
face Phoenix instead of Detroit. Saturday: Flames at Oilers _ This
could decide who the Stars play in the first round of the playoffs.
Sunday: Bruins at Flyers _ Flyers in jeopardy of falling all the
way to eighth place in the Eastern Conference.

BROWN PROBABLY ON WAY OUT IN PHILLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pack your bags, Larry Brown.
</P>
<P>
   No, the ultimate coaching nomad isn't moving on again by his own
choice. This time, it will be his brittle relationship with Sixers
star Allen Iverson that forces him to leave Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Remember how Magic Johnson forced out coach Paul Westhead in the
early '80s? How Michael Jordan longed for, and got, a coach other
than Doug Collins in Chicago? And Penny Hardaway leading a revolt
to push out Brian Hill three years ago?
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Philadelphia is headed the same direction:
</P>
<P>
   Star player and coach don't see eye-to-eye. Player gets his way.
Coach gets fired.
</P>
<P>
   If Brown doesn't already know it, Iverson is the league's
leading candidate for most valuable player and the man in Philly.
But Brown's butted heads with the lightning-quick shooting guard
all season, and even before.
</P>
<P>
   When Brown called for Iverson to re-enter last week's game
against Cleveland, Iverson responded ``About (bleeping) time.''
Brown then told Iverson, who had played all 12 minutes of the first
quarter and shot 0-for-7, to sit back down. He sat out the second
half, and was late joining the team on the bench for the third
quarter. After the game, Iverson said he would not play the next
game in Toronto and doubted that he would play at home against
Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Iverson called it ``a misunderstanding, a
miscommunication. Everything is not going to be peaches and cream
all the time, but I don't have any problems with \RBrown\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Iverson scored 27 points and said, ``It's no
time to act like a baby now,'' and ``I was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates, however, say the relationship between Iverson and
Brown is headed in the wrong direction. Brown is notoriously hard
on guards, and Iverson is the poster boy for Gen-X players full of
talent and themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Brown talked at length last week about players who don't put the
team first, saying `It's been a problem here the last eight, nine
years. It's been a problem in our league in a lot of cases with
losing teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson knows Brown was talking about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might be; I don't put it past him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is philosophical suicide for Brown. In a league that has
already swallowed up Bernie Bickerstaff, Del Harris, John Calipari
and Dave Cowens this season, getting along with players is priority
No. 1 _ especially player No. 1. Also on the hot seat: New York's
Jeff Van Gundy, Phoenix's Danny Ainge, the Clippers' Chris Ford,
Vancouver's Brian Hill, Boston's Rick Pitino and, yes, even the
Mavericks' Don Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the business,'' said Orlando's Chuck Daly. ``You never
hear of anyone in the league office losing their job. You rarely
hear about a general manager getting fired. And scouts are pretty
secure, too. There's a hot seat with every franchise, and it's
usually where the coach sits.''
</P>
<P>
   Right or wrong, Brown must cool his relationship with Iverson
immediately or be the next to feel that heat.
QUICK HITS
AROUND THE EAST
</P>
<P>
   The struggling Celtics brought in Bill Russell for a formal
number retirement ceremony and a pep talk last week. ``He could
speak about anything, and I would be in awe,'' said guard Kenny
Anderson. ... The Bucks have begun to put on quite a floor show in
warm-ups, at times coming out for layups in Chris Gatling-style
headbands, putting on a dunking display or even intentionally
missing layups to get their misses out of the way. And now,
Haywoode Workman is letting out a scream on the court right before
the jump ball. ``I've never coached warm-ups,'' Bucks coach George
Karl said. ``They're free to prepare for war in any manner they
desire.'' ... Orlando's Penny Hardaway has made it clear that he no
longer wants to play point guard _ much to the frustration of coach
Chuck Daly. Things changed quickly when starting shooting guard
Nick Anderson left the lineup last week with a hamstring strain,
Hardaway moved over and Darrell Armstrong started at point guard.
The result was phenomenal. The Magic won all four games, Hardaway
scored 30, 24, 30 and 24, and now he won't go back into the box at
point guard. Anderson is healthy again, but he won't get his
starting role back.
\Nsubheds:AROUND THE WEST
</P>
<P>
   Things are rocky again in Houston for Scottie Pippen. He sat out
the final 8:02 of Thursday's loss to San Antonio, in which he was
outscored by Sean Elliott, 19-7. He's also been lit up by Utah's
Bryon Russell (25 points) and, yikes, the Clippers' Tyrone Nesby
(24 points, 10 of 14 from the field) in the past two weeks. ...
More proof that Nick Van Exel is one of the more flaky, talented
players in the league. Motivated by playing a Lakers team that
traded him last April, he went off for 41 points in LA last week.
In his previous three games, Van Exel had scored a combined 31
points. ... The Timberwolves decided last week to take the Nets'
1999 first-round draft pick unconditionally to complete the Stephon
Marbury trade.
\Nsubheds:QUOTE TO NOTE
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep your eye and focus on God. God's going to
favor us because of our faith.'' _ Knicks guard Charlie Ward,
downplaying the team's record. Guess the Almighty favors Orlando's
faith more.
\Nsubheds:OFFBEAT BEAT
</P>
<P>
   With its plodding pace, record-low scoring and scarce
buzzer-beaters, this irregular season is nothing to jump and down
about. But don't tell that to coaches, who are quickly making
pacing the sideline a pet peeve right behind slapping hands with a
shooter after a missed free throw.
</P>
<P>
   Example: In last week's titanic Mavericks-Clippers struggle at
Reunion Arena, both veteran Chris Ford and Don Nelson were prowling
and yelling at least 10 feet from their seat on the bench. The
score was 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   The king of overcoaching, however, is the Knicks' Jeff Van
Gundy. Down 12 with 19 seconds left in last week's loss at Indiana,
Van Gundy crouched near midcourt and clapped his hands to encourage
effort from players who had long _ and justifiably _ given up. In
an earlier victory against the Clippers, Van Gundy was seen pacing,
calling plays and using extensive body language in a game his team
led by 19 with 1:02 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches should take a clue from the Pacers' Larry Bird, who only
stands up to stretch his legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to stand up too much because I feel it interferes
with the play of the players, to always be looking over there for
help and guidance,'' Bird says. ``I like for our team, once the
game starts, just to play. Players can tune a coach out pretty
quickly in this league.''
Numbers Game
</P>
<P>
   ]24: Consecutive road losses by the Nuggets before last week's
victory in Vancouver. ``It was like we won the second round of the
playoffs, like we swept Utah or something,'' said guard Chauncey
Billups. Best and Worst
</P>
<P>
   Worst draft: If last week's Portsmouth Invitational predraft
camp is any indication, this year's draft could be the worst in
years. ``It's the worst group of talent I've ever seen there,''
said one Western Conference scout. ``There's not one player who
could play in the NBA next season.'' The draft's stock should
improve at this week's Desert Classic in Phoenix, where most of the
projected lottery picks show up.
</P>
<P>
   Best coaching move: LA's Kurt Rambis did the right thing by
benching free-throw clanger Shaquille O'Neal on the final
possession in Phoenix. The only thing he did wrong was apologize
for it after his designed play for Glen Rice resulted in a
game-winning jumper. ``It was probably the wrong decision,'' Rambis
said. ``Shaq's our go-to guy. He's going to make or break us in the
playoffs.'' A better move would be targeting Rice as LA's clutch
shooter.
</P>
<P>

`OUT OF THE CHANNEL' A PAINFUL LOOK BACK AT SPILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Anybody who loves the marine environments and maritime
communities of the Pacific Coast should, albeit with a bit of pain,
read John Keeble's ``Out of the Channel: The Exxon-Valdez Oil Spill
in Prince William Sound.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is an investigative work, as well as a personal memoir,
of the greatest environmental disaster to hit the United States,
and of its yet-to-end aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Originally issued after the spill, ``Out of the Channel'' has
been updated to show how the spill set off a succession of
discouraging events. They include the high death rates in a killer
whale pod that resides in the pristine environment fouled by the
spill, the destructive clearcutting of forests by cash-strapped
native corporations, and a back-door deal between Exxon and a group
of seven Seattle-based seafood processors.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon quietly paid out a $70 million settlement for fishing
losses to the ``Seattle Seven.'' Secretly, however, the processors
agreed to apply for their share of any punitive damages awarded to
fishermen suing the oil giant. They would then hand the money back
to Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   A writing professor at Eastern Washington University, Keeble has
an eye for characters. Several are from the village of Cordova,
Alaska, whose fishermen fought against construction of the
Trans-Alaska Pipeline and warned that the Alyeska Pipeline Co. was
not prepared to deal with a spill.
</P>
<P>
   He relates a memorable prediction, delivered by phone to a
meeting in Valdez just six hours before the Exxon-Valdez went
aground on Bligh Reef. It came from Dr. Riki Ott, a marine
biologist and Cordova-based gillnetter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the high frequency of tankers into Port Valdez, the
increasing age and size of the tanker fleet, and the inability to
quickly contain and clean up an oil spill in the open water of
Alaska, fishermen feel that we are playing a game of Russian
roulette,'' Ott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When, not if, The Big One does occur and much or all of the
income from a fishing season is lost, compensation for processors,
support industries and local communities will be difficult if not
impossible to obtain,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The prediction has proven remarkably accurate. Exxon has used a
multiplicity of appeals to avoid paying a $5.3 billion civil
judgment awarded in 1994 by an Anchorage jury. In Cordova, the
largest cannery has closed. The value of a fishing license is
perhaps one-tenth of what it was before the spill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of the Channel'' is not a book of stereotypes. Keeble is
sympathetic to Capt. Joe Hazelwood, depicted as a drunken
ne'er-do-well even though he wasn't on the bridge at the time of
the accident. Keeble is scathing toward the U.S. Coast Guard for
its haphazard tracking of tankers and can't-happen-here attitude.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, Exxon has cleverly cut its losses from the '89
disaster. Its scientists claim that Prince William Sound has
completely recovered. Oil company apologists in the media have
taken to beating up Cordova, claiming the fishing village is
inhabited by people with nothing to do in the winter but watch
television and endlessly complain.
</P>
<P>
   Keeble presents a far truer picture. His Cordova is a town that
refuses to let Prince William Sound become the petroleum industry's
Potemkin Village, and dares to assert that a multinational company
must pay for the damage it did to a once-vibrant economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ Serb forces are heavily fortifying their
positions in Kosovo, particularly around the Pristina Airport,
moving anti-aircraft batteries, tanks and other heavy weapons into
villages and large civilian buildings such as factories, according
to refugees arriving here.
</P>
<P>
   A second group of refugees from villages near the
civilian-military airport in Pristina _ a target of recent NATO
bombings _ was allowed through the border here overnight Saturday.
Their accounts, which correspond with the previous group's, suggest
that what is happening is not a general reopening of the border by
Serbs as a continuation of their campaign to drive out ethnic
Albanians, but a new phase, the emptying out of specific strategic
sites for military bases.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a Serb village near the airport called Skulan has been
evacuated, ethnic Albanian refugees from the neighboring area said
Sunday, so that the former Serb village can be turned into what
they describe as the major air defense point. In Skulan, they said,
surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft guns had been hidden in
and around a big factory that had made electrical products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every night they are fighting NATO from Skulan,'' a refugee
said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been increasing Serb troop movements on the roads
over the past three days, the refugees said. They describe
concentrations of tanks and troops hiding in villages, tanks in
forested areas camouflaged with tree branches and leaves over them,
railroad tank cars full of fuel shuttled from a station during the
day and returned at night, and squads of Serb policemen rushing
about packed into civilian cars whose lack of license plates
indicate they had been taken from fleeing refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The account suggest the extensive NATO bombing has had little
effect on the Serbs' ability to move and deploy their forces, who
usually operate in small groups, in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more ominously, the accounts suggest that they are
digging in for the kind of defensive war that has always been in
the heart of Yugoslav army doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees who arrived at about 2 a.m. Sunday, roughly 5,000
of them, had traveled from two adjacent village clusters, first
Miradije-E-Ulet and Miradije-e-Larte, which they said were about
two miles from the airport. The other group had come from the
nearby village of Vragoli.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts of both groups suggested the Serb tactic was not to
terrorize them, but to move them out as expeditiously as possible.
Their treatment was marginally different from that of earlier
refugees, suggesting a new tactic. It would be absurd to call them
well treated, but by the standards of brutality that have applied
here, both groups arrived in notably better shape than the broken,
weeping, traumatized refugees who arrived in the last wave
numbering almost 300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, both groups arriving here in the last
two days contained large numbers of men and there were no accounts
of slayings as the people were driven off. As has become routine,
however, they were robbed and their identifying documents destroyed
before they were sent on their way.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers said they were called together at 12:45 Saturday
afternoon and ordered to leave after an ultimatum issued the day
before, the demand reinforced by volleys of shots in the air. Like
the first group, they were directed along a lengthy circuitous
route over secondary roads left, and then back east, to join the
main highway to the border around Prizrin.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like the earlier group, they traveled along roads once so
clogged with refugees it took a day to go a few dozen miles and
were now empty except for Serb military traffic. They, too, saw
burned-out farms and villages along with wandering cows and sheep,
but their descriptions of clusters of tanks and other military
activity were much more extensive, perhaps indicating the pace of
Serb military movements had stepped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw burned tractors, yes, but traffic, no,'' one man said.
``Only police. Private cars with no plates filled with police.''
</P>
<P>
   They said that Serb forces had moved tanks and other weapons
into Vragoli as soon as it was cleared. On the bridge over the
Sidrica River, the Serbs had placed anti-aircraft guns, a young man
said, mimicking a weapon that can be rotated and aimed by a system
of foot pedals and hand cranks, corresponding to the Soviet-style
M-75.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we left our village, I had seen with my own eyes the
tanks enter our village,'' said one man, who, like other refugees
interviewed Sunday, declined to give his name because for fear of
retribution if he returned.
</P>
<P>
   In a different different area, another villager said: ``At the
moment we left, the tanks and artillery were coming behind there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Serbs now are stuffed into the houses of the Albanians
or up on top of the hills,'' another refugee said.

<P>
   The movement of Serb troops had been so heavy, one man said,
that for three weeks his village had been isolated not by being
surrounded, but simply by the amount of military traffic.
</P>
<P>
   There was sporadic gunfire along the isolated mountainous
stretches of the Albanian-Serb border between elements of the
Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbs. A local Albanian border
commander, Bajram Gosturani, told the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe that two people had been killed in the
village of Tropoje when a Serbian mortar shell struck the village.

   KOSOVO-RUSSIA (Moscow) _ The NATO bombing of Yugoslavia may or
may not free the Kosovars; but a thousand miles from Belgrade it
has had a profoundly liberating effect. After eight long-suffering
years, it's once again acceptable _ even de rigeur _ for Russians
to dislike Americans. Enough of them have embraced animosity, and
with such sudden fervor, that some Russian experts say it threatens
to become the guiding force in a relationship with little else
going for it. By Michael Wines.

   TERMLIMITS-POLITICS (Spokane, Wash.) _ Once seen as the poster
child for the term-limits movement, which seemed to be catching
fire in 1994 but has quieted down in the wake of adverse court
rulings and flush economic times, Rep. George Nethercutt, the man
who defeated Speaker Thomas Foley five years ago, is one of 58
members of Congress who have set a limit on their time in office,
and one of 10 House members whose pledges come due next fall. And
of those 10, all but one of them Republicans, at least four are
currently wavering on their pledges, driven in part by the urgings
of party leaders and the high stakes involved in the 2000 races:
with the Democrats needing just six seats to retake control of
Congress, every seat is vital, and Republicans seem loathe to
sacrifice strong incumbents on the altar of the term-limits cause.

 &HT;    PRIMITIVE ALBANIAN AIRPORT BECOMES THROBBING NATO BASE
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    With PHOTOS 
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service (at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   RINAS AIR FIELD, Albania In just seven days, the U.S. Air Force
has turned this primitive airport into a throbbing airbase moving
more cargo every day than the Allies flew in at the height of the
1948 Berlin Airlift.
</P>
<P>
   Against a leaden gray sky, the West's nearest airfield to Kosovo
surged with adrenaline on Sunday. Its flight line roared almost
nonstop with beating rotors from scores of humanitarian helicopters
whirling in from the refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   About every 15 minutes, the rotor noise was overwhelmed by the
whine of a giant C-17 wide-bodied Air Force transport or a smaller
C-130 screaming in from Germany. Interspersed every half hour or so
was a transport plane from one of half a dozen non-NATO aid donors.
</P>
<P>
   If the overall NATO air war against Slobodan Milosevic is bogged
down, there was no sign of it here at Rinas. In the last five days,
the Air Force has pushed more than 2,000 tons of cargo through its
single runway _ a cargo flow that the Air Force says is bigger than
the cargo tonnage handled by Chicago's O'Hare International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Berlin Airlift Two, I suppose,'' said Air Force Maj.
Brian Jurkovac, 38, of Columbus, Ohio, who flew in from a NATO base
in Germany a week ago to set up satellite communications and help
coordinate cargo unloading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's C-17 transports can carry so much more than the C-47s
and C-54s that they were using 50 years ago,'' he said. ``The flow
and amount of aircraft and the density of the aircraft is very
similar to what was used in the Berlin Airlift, except that the
tonnages and the transport planes are much bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was the first day that the U.S. Air Force took over
control of all the airspace within five miles of the airport from
the Albanian air controllers.
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday was the first night that the Air Force had enough
landing beacons and radars in place to extend the daylight airlift
into a round-the-clock operation. Night operations have begun, an
Air Force duty officer confirmed just before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday American airmen at this base outside the capital
Tirana expected to take over control of a wider sector _ the
so-called ``approach'' zone extending out to 60 miles from Rinas.
</P>
<P>
   The hulking U.S. transports that made up the bulk of the airlift
Sunday carried everything from aid rations to the first batch of
heavy trucks to support the U.S. Army's expected Apache helicopters
and artillery rocket launchers.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the 430 airmen and women in the Air Force's ground
party at Rinas, Sunday will be remembered more as a mudlift than an
airlift. Spring is supposed to be sunny in Tirana, but over the
last three nights it has rained buckets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water table is so high that if you dig down a foot you hit
water,'' said Staff Sgt. Jesse Parker, 32, who woke up Sunday with
eight inches of water in his tent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are below ground water level, and we are living in water,''
said Staff Sgt. Neil Rothbauer, 33, of Hallettsville, Texas. ``We
are trying to build up the ground and set up our communications and
living areas, you name it.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Rinas was Albania's only functioning civilian
airport. And it wasn't functioning much.
</P>
<P>
   Without a single working radar or beacon for instrument
landings, Rinas managed to attract only about five or six flights a
day by Albania's national airline and a few intrepid foreign
carriers. The buzz among journalists covering the Balkans was that
Rinas was about the scariest airport in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In a week, almost everything at Rinas has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Up in the ramshackle Albanian control tower, Air Force master
sergeants who are some of the top air controllers in the U.S.
military were giving crisp orders on the radio to pilots from
France, Switzerland, Germany and a half-dozen other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robot 41, re-position granted,'' intoned Air Force Tech. Sgt.
Whit Morrison, who until a week ago was on a temporary assignment
drafting radar procedures at Ramstein Air Force Base, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   There was one plane _ a slender blue and white Lear jet _ that
seemed oddly out of place as it circled the base amongst the
military hubbub. At least a dozen times, it whooshed in for
landings, only to pull up at the last second and whirl around the
airfield to make another approach.
</P>
<P>
   The Lear, based in Oklahoma City, was sent here by the U.S.
Federal Aviation Administration to test the positioning of the Air
Force radars and certify the airport for precision landings. And by
late in the day, according to Jurkovac, the FAA
</P>
<P>
   had passed the word to the military that Rinas was safe for
instrument-landing operations.
</P>
<P>
   Once officially certified by the FAA, American air controllers
here will be in direct touch with the Air Force's AWACS command
planes, said Jurkovac. The AWACS is the battle controller the Air
Force uses to run the minute-to-minute operations of the air war
over Serbia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO's urging, the Albanian parliament passed an emergency
resolution five days ago ceding to NATO the authority to take over
control of Albanian airspace.
</P>
<P>
   To bring that off in a few days, the Air Force flew in a TACAN
navigational beacon that by Sunday was already beaming out a radio
signal that was guiding planes on their final approach. Another new
olive drab radar with a rotating dish, called the Approach
Surveillance Radar (ASR), was within a few hours of becoming
operational.
</P>
<P>
   Already set in place and being tested Sunday were two more
radars that could come in handy if bad weather persists and Rinas
has to juggle humanitarian flights and attack helicopter missions
by the Army's Apache helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Precision Approach Radar and the Mobile Microwave
Landing System, they are designed to allow military airplanes to
land in soupy weather with cloud ceilings down to 200 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the allies, the one runway has landing lights
and was repaved only a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   How and whether the Rinas base will fit into the overall war is
a question nobody at Rinas was ready to answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea about the Apaches,'' said Capt. Mitch Maddox,
31, of Wewahitchka, Fla., whose First Combat Communications
Squadron was setting up a 20-foot-wide satellite telephone dish for
the base. ``As far as I know, we are just here to support the
humanitarian effort.''

FISTICUFSS AT THE BUFFET TABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A body-slam specialist is now governing the great
state of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Pro rassler Lex Luger has a headlock on Larry King, and Stone
Cold Steve Austin just tossed Clint Eastwood out of the ring in the
fight for late-night television ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Now we learn that sumo wrestlers have been proclaimed the
epicures of Japanese society.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-minute tea ceremony once represented the essence of
Japanese grace and tradition. A few sea urchin eggs embedded in a
sushi roll was the ultimate gastronomical turn-on in Kobe and
Kyoto.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's a pitch-till-you-win, eat-it-and-beat-it race to the
buffet table in the land of Koko, Yum Yum and Nanki-Poo.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Wall Street Journal correspondent, there are
about 180 all-you-can-eat restaurants in Tokyo alone. From the
enthusiasm of the customers, ``Load Till You Explode'' seems to be
the Japanese interpretation of Royal Fork. And the fuse is
connected to a ticking clock.
</P>
<P>
   The latest rage in Japan, we learn, are the buffet restaurants
where speed and agility are just as important as capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The diner grabs a time card from the hostess, sprints to the
buffet line, shovels the food down at the closest table, then huffs
up to the front door where he punches his card and settles the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Customers pay by the minute. In one typical restaurant _
reporter Yumiko Ono reports _ the charge is 35 yen (or 30 cents) a
minute. One typical diner reduced his average restaurant bill from
$15.95 to $5.73 when he got his competitive juices pumping.
</P>
<P>
   Yr. Obdt. Correspondent doesn't like to brag. But you had better
have your Nike's laced if you want to beat me to the buffet table.
</P>
<P>
   Usually I head first for the more expensive dishes like:
</P>
<P>
   Stop-Watch Prawns
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds large, uncooked prawns
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chili sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   One-fourth teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon liquid smoke
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon paprika
</P>
<P>
   One half teaspoon dried oregano
</P>
<P>
   One half teaspoon Tabasco sauce
</P>
<P>
   Wash and shell the prawns, then distribute in a single layer
over a large oven dish.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the other ingredients in a small saucepan and simmer 10
minutes. Let cool, then pour the sauce over the shrimp and let
everything marinate for 30 minutes, mooshing everything around once
or twice.
</P>
<P>
   Shove the dish into a 300-degree oven and heat the shrimp just
until they turn pink.
</P>
<P>
   If you are serving this dish to non-paying guests in your home,
divide the prawns and sauce into four bowls and pass the French
bread.
</P>
<P>
   Or, for less money, serve the freeloaders a filling but
inexpensive meal like this one.
</P>
<P>
   Take It Easy Enchiladas
</P>
<P>
   1 pound ground turkey or ground beef
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup chopped onions
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces cream cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon water
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   9 flour tortillas
</P>
<P>
   1 can cream of chicken soup
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces sour cream
</P>
<P>
   1 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons pickled jalapeno slices, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 roma tomato, chopped
</P>
<P>
   In a lightly oiled skillet, brown the ground turkey and onions.
Remove from heat and add the tablespoon of water, the cream cheese,
cumin, pepper and salt.
</P>
<P>
   In a bowl combine the soup, sour cream, milk and jalapeno
peppers.
</P>
<P>
   Use one-half cup of this soup mixture to spread over the bottom
of a lightly oiled 9-by-12-inch oven dish.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon about one-quarter cup of the meat mixture over each
tortilla, roll up and place in dish seam side down.
</P>
<P>
   When all the tortillas have been filled scatter any leftover
meat mixture over the top, then pour the rest of the soup sauce
over the tortillas.
</P>
<P>
   Bake, covered, in a 350-degree oven for 40 minutes. Remove
cover, sprinkle with cheese, then return to oven uncovered for 4
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from oven and scatter the tomato bits over the top. This
should make four portions of two tortillas each with one left over
for the family's Mexican hairless.

OREGON WINEMAKER BREAKS ALL THE RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By M.L. LYKE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASTORIA, Ore. _ A wine snob might shudder in alarm after
stepping into this eccentric little winery that looks out over the
Columbia River. Lining the shelves are peach wine, plum wine,
cranberry wine, spiced apple wine and _ god forbid! _ lemon
meringue wine.
</P>
<P>
   Alarm might turn to horror as the winemaker, a self-described
curmudgeon given to deadpan rants and late-night harp sessions,
introduces his crown jewel _ a small expensive bottle of wine that
he calls the ultimate creation of his older years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything I create after this will be an anticlimax,'' says
Paul Van der Veldt, 74, pouring lush, syrup-thick Chocolate-Orange
wine into tasting glasses at Shallon Winery in downtown Astoria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chocolate-Orange wine? A tragedy!'' the wine snob might mutter
as he backs away from the offending glass.
</P>
<P>
   But these visitors are no wine snobs. They might even be
inclined to agree with the wine judge who called van der Veldt a
genius.
</P>
<P>
   Their eyes close. A satisfied ``mmmmmm'' goes up as they sip,
then lick the wine out of their glasses. They dip the last of the
precious liquid _ as silky and satisfying as a custom-made truffle
_ from the bottom of the glass with their pinkie fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do they protest when van der Veldt tells them the
ingredients: three kinds of chocolate, orange wine and whey.
</P>
<P>
   ``No whey!'' the wine snob might scream as he backs through the
door.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, whey. The same thin liquid that is left behind when cheese
is curdled from milk. Van der Veldt buys it from the Tillamook
Creamery Association and uses it in several of his handcrafted
fruit and berry wines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whey is one of the most nutritious foods in the world. It has
all the vitamins and minerals of milk,'' says the winemaker, a
slight, bearded, dry-witted man with the intensity of a zealot.
</P>
<P>
   Trained as an aeronautical engineer, he started the winery in
1978, two blocks up from the Columbia River Maritime Museum. He
named the winery after his favorite native plant, Galtheria
shallon, the salal plant.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked inside the 1920s Mediterranean-style building is a
research laboratory, a tasting room and a manufacturing room where
barrels of wine ferment and where van der Veldt keeps his harp,
next to a chair.
</P>
<P>
   Van der Veldt, who lives downstairs, comes up late at night to
style his own free-form creations on the harp strings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It relieves stress,'' says the fast-talking winemaker, who
offers _ between pours in the tasting room _ his opinions on
everything from irresponsible journalism and fine dining to local
politics.
</P>
<P>
   A third of Shallon's visitors are repeat customers. Most walk
away chuckling and toting a least one bottle of Shallon's
best-known wine, the wild evergreen blackberry. The wine,
surprisingly subtle, is redolent of berries and moss and woods,
with a character one wine critic described as ``austere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me back to my childhood near Seattle, playing around
the old cedar stumps and eating berries off the vine,'' poet Gary
Snyder wrote after tasting his first bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Van der Veldt, who proclaimed his father's blackberry wine much
too sweet, says he has a cadre of ``little old ladies'' who pick
the wild berries for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my little old ladies are dying off,'' he says, ``and kids
today won't do it _ no matter how much you pay them.''
</P>
<P>
   Van der Veldt says making wine from grapes is ridiculously
simple compared with working with the more obscure fruits. Still,
he sells a few grape varietals, including a red table wine called
``Gillnetter's Delight.'' He stomps the grapes for it himself.
</P>
<P>
   At Shallon, production is slow, quantities small, and stocks
iffy. Van der Veldt generally makes from five to 25 cases at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   Prices start at $10 and top out at $25 for a half-bottle of a
heady wild black raspberry desert wine. Each bottle comes with a
story and a lecture on proper care and pouring.
</P>
<P>
   Van der Veldt calls the winery a labor of love. Satisfaction may
be abundant, but profits tend to be slim. Still, van der Veldt
remains philosophic. ``By the time I'm totally broke,'' he says,
``I'll probably be totally dead.''
</P>
<P>
   In which case, this harp-playing curmudgeon with a thing for
whey will get the last laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done my obituary in advance,'' he says. ``I'm not going
to have some relative write: `Oh, he was loved by all.' It's not
true.''
</P>
<P>
   The winemaker smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want it to read: `He was a cantankerous old coot.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Shallon Winery tasting room is open every afternoon from
approximately noon to 6 p.m., at 16th Avenue between Marine Drive
and Duane Street in Astoria, Ore. The phone number is 503-325-5978;

MAVERICK ELECTED GOVERNOR OF TOKYO; PUSHES FOR RETURN OF U.S.
BASE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By NICHOLAS KRISTOF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Voters humiliated Japan's governing Liberal Democratic
Party in elections on Sunday, choosing a maverick nationalist as
the new governor of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Shintaro Ishihara, who easily defeated his rivals, had
campaigned on a platform of pushing to get the United States to
return one of its military bases in suburban Tokyo. In a late-night
acceptance speech, he said he will put pressure on Washington,
beginning immediately, to return the Yokota Air Base.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the U.S. is truly an equal partner with us, it is obliged
to consider my demand seriously,'' said Ishihara, a dapper
66-year-old who rose to fame as a college student by writing a
blockbuster novel.
</P>
<P>
   Ishihara will not have the power as governor to evict American
forces from the base. But he is a forceful and dynamic politician,
who by placing the issue on the public agenda can complicate life
for the American forces in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was caught in the mid-1990s in a debate over
whether American military bases in the southern Japanese island
group of Okinawa should be returned. That furor has subsided, but
American officials do not want a similar movement in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas L. Foley, the American ambassador, was asked repeatedly
Friday about Ishiharas campaign. But he responded by saying that
the United States does not comment on local Japanese elections.
</P>
<P>
   Ishihara also has said that he plans to demand that Foley
specify whether the United States will defend the Senkaku Islands,
which are also claimed by China and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Foley would not comment on that either.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in China and South Korea are apprehensive about
Ishihara, not so much because of any international authority he can
exert in Tokyo, but because he will have a stage for his
nationalist views.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, he has called for Japan to develop nuclear weapons,
dismissed the 1937 ``Rape of Nanking,'' in which Japanese troops
killed tens of thousands of Chinese, as ``a lie,'' and suggested
that Japan might think about selling high-technology goods not to
the United States but to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   He comes across as someone who yearns for Japan to be treated
with greater respect by other countries, especially the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   His election does not mean Tokyo voters necessarily agree with
him on security issues. He is also a forceful and charismatic
politician and an unusually strong leader for Japan _ and he
attributed his election to a desire for stronger leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want a strong and straightforward message,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have strongly felt that all the existing political parties
have already lost their values,'' he added. ``And politicians have
not yet realized the fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Ishihara, although he served for many years in Parliament as a
Liberal Democrat, ran as an independent. The Liberal Democratic
candidate, Yasushi Akashi, a former U.N. diplomat, had a dismal
fourth-place finish. It was the first time that a Liberal Democrat
has not come in at least second.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchis' job seems secure despite the
humiliation, but the Liberal Democrats' secretary-general, Yoshiro
Mori, may be pushed out to take responsibility for the defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The party's poor performance reflects its loss of influence in
the big cities of Japan, but it retains its power in rural areas
and it did reasonably well in other races around the country. In
particular, the Liberal Democrats won two of the three
parliamentary seats that were being contested in by-elections.

 &HT;    U.S. OFFICIALS SAY MILOSEVIC MUST BE REPLACED IF THERE IS TO BE
PEACE IN BALKANS
 &HT;    EDS: Optional trim at 600.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia
again restrained by bad weather, U.S. officials escalated their
diplomatic assaults Sunday, characterizing President Slobodan
Milosevic as a war criminal and suggesting he be replaced as a
prelude to peace in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb leader ``is going to be held responsible'' for war
atrocities by the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague,
Deputy U.S. Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said on the CBS News
program ``Face The Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, and on separate news programs Sunday, White House
Chief of Staff John Podesta said Serbs need ``a new leader'' in
order to be part of a stable democratic Europe and U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen said it would be ``very difficult'' to
negotiate a peace with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, upon arriving in
Brussels late Sunday for talks to bolster NATO unity, said ``lots
of parts'' of the Kosovo peace accord negotiated last month at
Rambouillet, outside Paris, between Serbs and Kosovar Albanians
``have been overtaken by events.''
</P>
<P>
   The television appearances of Talbott, Podesta and Cohen
coincided with that of NATO Supreme Commander Gen. Wesley Clark,
who repeatedly warned that the allied bombing campaign against
Milosevic, which now involves some 600 aircraft, is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the air campaign has a long way to go,'' he said on
NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' ``I think we need to give the air
campaign a chance to do its work....''
</P>
<P>
   Clark declined to speculate in response to questions about the
use of ground troops in Kosovo even though Talbott had suggested
that contingency plans for NATO ground forces ``can be taken off
the shelf and updated at any time'' by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress returns to work from its Easter recess Monday, a
vigorous debate over Clinton's policy in Yugoslavia and the
possible use of U.S. ground troops for combat in Kosovo is expected
to dominate the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who has consistently urged Clinton to
leave open the possibility of ground troops, said Sunday that he
hoped Congress would adopt a resolution authorizing the president
to ``use all means necessary'' to win the Balkan war.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., said the president should not have
ruled out the use of ground troops when he launched ``Operation
Allied Force'' against Milosevic last month. ``I think it's
necessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress returns in the wake of increasing reports of atrocities
allegedly committed by Serb soldiers, police and paramilitary units
against the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees who
have been forced from their homes in Kosovo after the NATO bombing
began.
</P>
<P>
   NATO released aerial photos Sunday showing what allied officials
suspect are dozens of freshly dug graves in Pusto Selo, Kosovo.
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said the image, taken Friday, was not
unlike the mass graves found in Bosnia after the war there between
Serbs and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen declined to elaborate on the report of mass graves in
Kosovo. However, he did say that ``every day that goes by ... we
see more and more evidence of ... grotesque brutality'' against
Kosovar Albanians. When asked if Milosevic is a war criminal, Cohen
replied, ``What his status would be is for others to determine.''
However, under current circumstances, ``I think it would be very
difficult to deal with Mr. Milosevic,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Talbott came closer than any other Clinton administration
official to calling Milosevic a war criminal. ``As for what happens
to Mr. Milosevic, he is going to be held responsible by the
international community _ and in the first instance, that means the
International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Podesta flatly rejected the suggestion that NATO is negotiating
at all with Milosevic. To stop the bombing, Milosevic must remove
Serb forces from Kosovo, permit the refugees to return and let them
live ``in peace and autonomy,'' he said. ``That's not
negotiating.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking beyond the current conflict, which is about to enter its
fourth week, Podesta said that for Serbia to join a peaceful
democratic Europe, it ``needs to have a measure of democracy and
the leadership that's going to respect human rights and respect the
autonomy of the people'' with the Yugoslavian republics.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he meant that Yugoslavia must have a new leader,
Podesta replied, ``I think that, ultimately, that for them to
create a stable situation, it looks to me like they're going to
need a new leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Podesta ruled out any settlement of the conflict that would
include a partitioning of Kosovo between Serbs and ethnic
Albanians. ``I don't see that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Albright, in comments to reporters accompanying her to
Brussels, declined to preclude partition _ stripping the Serbs of
all but a northern region where the Serbs have their shrines and
are more predominant in a province about 90 percent ethnic
Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that in light of Milosevic's ``scorched-earth''
campaign in Kosovo, there has to be ``some reconsideration'' of the
Rambouillet peace accords that the Serbs rejected and the ethnic
Albanians accepted.
</P>
<P>
   The Rambouillet accords call for the withdrawal of Serb troops,
paramilitary and police units. A total of 5,000 troops could remain
_ 2,500 along the border, thereby assuring Kosovo remained part of
Serbia, and 2,500 police who could remain for one year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who was at the Camp David presidential retreat Sunday,
will highlight his Kosovo policy in a speech on Monday at Barksdale
Air Force Base in Louisiana. He also will meet Monday with U.S.
bomber crews at Barksdale and with congressional leaders at the
White House.

SOME POLITICIANS RECONSIDER PLEDGES TO LIMIT THEIR TIME IN OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Ariz., Fla., Idaho, S.C., Okla., Colo., Mass.)  (js) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPOKANE, Wash. _ George R. Nethercutt Jr. was the giant slayer
five years ago when, in his first race for public office, he
unseated a speaker of the House of Representatives for the first
time since the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt, pledging to serve no more than three terms in the
House, scoffed at arguments of the speaker then, Tom Foley, a
30-year House veteran, that his influence and experience were
vital.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is indispensable in this district,'' Nethercutt told
voters at the time. ``The state is bigger than one man.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, as Nethercutt, a Republican, travels the 5th District
in what is increasingly looking like a re-election bid, he is
telling voters that his term-limits pledge, a potent campaign tool
at the time, may have been a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I said and I wish I hadn't said it,'' he told a
town hall meeting at the Garfield County Fairgrounds earlier this
month. ``I have lived and learned.''
</P>
<P>
   Once seen as the poster child for the term-limits movement,
which seemed to be catching fire in 1994 but has quieted down after
adverse court rulings and flush economic times, Nethercutt is one
of 58 members of Congress who have set a limit on their time in
office, and one of 10 House members whose pledges come due next
fall.
</P>
<P>
   And of those 10, all but one of them Republicans, at least four
are wavering on their pledges, driven in part by the urgings of
party leaders and the high stakes involved in the 2000 races: With
the Democrats needing just six seats to retake control of Congress,
every seat is vital, and Republicans seem loath to sacrifice strong
incumbents on the altar of the term-limits cause.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews in the district here strongly suggest that, so far
anyway, few voters are waking up in the morning enraged over the
possibility that Nethercutt might run again.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, those that do break their vow to leave can
already have a taste of what may be in store for them in the form
of a television advertisement run here in Spokane recently by
United States Term Limits, an advocacy group that is threatening to
spend millions of dollars in next year's elections to express its
outrage over those who betrayed their cause.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement features footage of Richard Nixon's ``I am not
a crook'' speech, George Bush's ``Read my lips _ no new taxes''
pledge and Bill Clinton's finger-wagging declaration, ``I did not
have sexual relations with that woman.'' And then it asks: ``Will
George Nethercutt be next?''
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt has sought to turn the advertisement against its
creators, describing them as part of an ``outside group that wants
to poison the atmosphere in eastern Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   His spokesperson calls the advertisement ``off the deep end''
and says that despite the group's call for voters to flood the
congressman's office with calls demanding that he leave office,
most people are actually calling to urge him to run again.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-year-old congressman, who now says it is not a good idea
to have a district ``perpetually served by freshmen,'' promises a
firm decision sometime this spring. Though he has toyed with the
notion of what would be an uphill race for governor against the
state's popular Democratic incumbent, Gary Locke, most indications
are that he will run for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The term-limits group is based in Washington, D.C., and run by a
libertarian, Paul Jacob. So far, its rumblings have delighted the
Democrats, who feel they have an excellent chance to win in some of
the districts where Republicans are in the hot seat over
term-limits pledges.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who scored a stunning takeover of Congress in 1994
in part over the pledge to put more ``citizen legislators'' in the
body, are openly torn on whether to stick with the theme, which
could force them to jettison incumbents and create many more ``open
races'' in coming years. Brett Bader, a Republican consultant based
in Seattle who has worked on races across the West, said in an
interview, ``We are in danger of eating our own over this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone who promised to leave in 2000 is agonizing over the
pledge. Rep. Matt Salmon of Arizona, who was elected in 1994 and
who shortly after his swearing-in theatrically handed a resignation
letter effective in 2001 to the congressional clerk, said he had no
ambivalence about honoring his promise to leave Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you, it is a terrible thing to have to do,''
Salmon said, tongue very much in cheek, in a telephone interview.
``I'm going to be forced to play a lot more golf with my son. I'm
going to attend a lot more of my daughter's school plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Salmon, 41, a father of four, may stay very busy even
after he returns to Arizona full time. In a state where polls have
shown a significant degree of support for term limits, honoring his
pledge has helped vault him into the circle of candidates
prominently mentioned for the 2002 governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   The term-limits group lists 58 members of Congress as serving
under self-imposed term-limit pledges. Of the 10 who the group says
pledged to step down after next year, six say they still intend to
do so. In addition to Salmon, they are Charles T. Canady of
Florida, Helen Chenoweth of Idaho, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Jack
Metcalf of Washington and Mark Sanford of South Carolina. All are
Republicans.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt is perhaps the most visible incumbent who is still
undecided. Others who are listed by the term-limits group as
``wafflers'' are Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat
described by an aide as leaning toward running for re-election,
Tillie Fowler, a Florida Republican who won in 1992 with the slogan
``Eight Is Enough,'' referring to the years she pledged to spend in
the House, and Scott McInnis, a Colorado Republican.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis' case may well illustrate the limited perils involved in
breaking a term-limits pledge. After saying when he first won the
seat in 1992 that he would serve just three terms, he abandoned
that commitment last year and nevertheless won re-election handily.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler, who is considering a bid for an open U.S. Senate seat,
has said she may run for re-election to the House despite the
``Eight Is Enough'' slogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a big issue in the election,'' she told The Florida
Times-Union in December. ``My problem was, I was too honest with
you the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the term-limits group says the issue still resonates
powerfully with voters, others question its impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the American people were ever living and dying
term limits to begin with,'' said John David Rausch, a professor of
political science at West Texas A&AMP;M University, who has studied
term-limits initiatives. ``Now it's even less of a movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with voters here suggest that the recent television
advertisements may have backfired, with many people describing them
as too negative and others expressing such cynicism with the
political process that they said they had not taken Nethercutt's
pledge seriously to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the same old say-this, do-that,'' said Doris
Speicher, a retired homemaker in Spokane.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not to say the incumbent faces an easy ride next
year. Pressed on the issue, some people said that it might be a
factor in their vote next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like him and all,'' said Bob Sjogren, 54, a probation
officer from Colville, Wash., and a Republican. ``But maybe he
should be held accountable. The man made a pledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Sjogren's wife, Gloria, expressed surprise: ``Oh, I think I'd
vote for him again, Bob, I really do. He's right on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a district that sent a Democrat to Congress for three
decades before electing Nethercutt, and that voted for Clinton in
both 1992 and 1996, many people do not seem to think the incumbent
is right on the issues, which could pose a more ominous challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't care so much on this term-limits stuff,'' said
Jim Lawrence, a computer support technician, who voted for
Nethercutt in 1994 but regrets it now. ``He let us down on schools;
he let us down on health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing down the specific issue of term limits, Nethercutt, a
lawyer and Spokane native, has sought in his visits here in recent
months to argue that he has kept a wider trust with the voters. In
response to the ``Keep your word, George'' bumper stickers handed
out by the term-limits group, Nethercutt said, ``I assume they mean
my promise to cut taxes, balance the budget and end the welfare
system as we knew it _ that's what I promised too.''
</P>
<P>
   And he has often said that though he meant it when he first said
he would step down after three terms, reconsideration is not a
terrible thing. Asked about the issue before a high-school class in
Pullman in February, he said, ``Only fools and dead people never
change their minds.''

BAND ON THE FAST BREAK

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The best way to get noticed by sports fans at John
Elway's high school alma mater isn't so much on the playing field.
Grab a triangle and join the band.
</P>
<P>
   The Granada Hills Highlander Marching Band's next gig will be

</P>
<P>
   Dena Zelig, a former GHHS drum major, works for Saban
Entertainment, which produced the movie. During scenes of Jordan
playing in high school, they needed a festive band for background.
Zelig, true to her school, suggested the Highlanders.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? They played for the Adam Sandler movie ``The

</P>
<P>
   _ Robin Givens , the former Mrs. Mike Tyson , gets to pretend

</P>
<P>
   _ Elway, meanwhile, came in ranked 15th on a list of the ``25
Most Powerful People in Denver'' by the city's magazine 5280 (get
it, mile high?). The mag cited Elway for his snub of President
Clinton and his TV commercials campaigning for the Broncos new
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   And makes him !ital!only No. 15? In !ital!Denver ? . . .
</P>
<P>
   _ Elway joined Chinese premier Zhu Rongji at a dinner Saturday
night in Denver, and Broncos owner Pat Bowlen gave the dignitary a
jersey with Elway's No. 7 and his own name _ ``ZHU'' _ on the back.
</P>
<P>
   Which should end any speculation about Elway's three-peat plans.
. . .
</P>
<P>
   _ Elway's agent, Marvin Demoff, has said the 38-year-old has to
make his decision about coming back by about mid-May so that he can
start on his training regimen.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos aren't pushing any commitment despite the QB-rich
NFL draft this weekend because they're committed to Bubby Brister
and Brian Griese if Elway retires. . . .
</P>
<P>
   _ After all the success veteran quarterbacks had last season,
especially those given up for dead, why would there be !ital!any
demand for a supply of young arms? . . .
</P>
<P>
   _ Whitey Herzog has been getting far too much attention for
popping off in his new book, ``You're Missing A Great Game'' _
which is what most people told him during each trading deadline
when he came back to be the Angels' GM in the early '90s. . . .
</P>
<P>
   _ Why does Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's name keep coming up whenever
there's a college coaching vacancy? . . .
</P>

great taste of a true pilsner beer with self-proclaimed supermodel

(and free pub). And of course we'll never be able to trust Reilly's
hypocritical stance on any major issue knowing he once was paid by
a beer company to pitch its product.
</P>

<P>
   Tax returns from Americans earning more than $100,000 a year and
from the biggest corporations are increasingly escaping the
scrutiny of the Internal Revenue Service, new agency figures show.
</P>
<P>
   Just one of every 60 high-income tax returns was audited last
year, compared with a rate of one in nine in 1988, according to IRS
data analyzed by Syracuse University researchers. Among the
country's 8,500 largest companies, slightly more than one in three
were audited last year, down from two out of three in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   While audit rates overall have fallen substantially since 1986,
some tax experts and former IRS officials are worried that the
decline in high-income and corporate audits may mean that reporting
by many of the richest taxpayers is now effectively on an honor
system, inviting abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the investments and deductions used by such taxpayers,
these critics note, are not subject to the kinds of reporting
required of employers, banks, mortgage lenders and others, which
must pass along information on income and potential deductions to
the IRS. And for the less affluent, of course, the bulk of income
taxes are withheld from paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fewer traffic policemen you have, the more chances people
are going to take,'' said Donald C. Alexander, a Washington tax
lawyer who was IRS commissioner in the Nixon administration. ``And
as people find that their neighbors are not paying their fair
share, they are encouraged to not pay their share, either.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRS contends that sufficient audits were conducted last
year. The assistant commissioner for audits, Tom Smith, said that
increased financial reporting requirements by employers and others,
combined with changes in tax law, had reduced the need to audit
wage earners, while other strategies, such as tip-reporting
agreements with restaurant owners, lower the need for audits, too.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in audit rates began in 1968 but accelerated in
1995, after Congress, by then controlled by Republicans, cut IRS
spending sharply and required the agency to devote more resources
to customer service. Republicans characterized the IRS as an agency
that was out of control and that was intruding far too deeply into
the lives of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, the IRS has reduced the hours it spends auditing tax
returns by 27 percent for individuals and 12 percent for
corporations, according to the new data.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, overall audit rates fell to record lows last year.
Of the 120 million individual tax returns, only one in 217 was
audited, down 36 percent from 1994. During the same period, the
number of returns reflecting incomes of $100,000 and up grew 62
percent, to six million.
</P>
<P>
   The audit data also show the reversal of a trend that emerged a
few years ago in which audits rose for the lowest-income Americans,
those making less than $25,000. Last year, one in 370 such returns
was audited, down from one in 178 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela F. Olson, a tax lawyer with the law firm of Weil, Gotshal
&AMP; Manges in Washington who is a former chairwoman of the American
Bar Association's tax section, said she was neither surprised nor
troubled by the drop in overall audit rates, given the increased
reporting required of employers, lenders and others. She said that
large, publicly traded companies also get sufficient scrutiny, not
only from the IRS but from independent auditors and the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But like a number of other tax experts, Ms. Olson said that the
IRS was paying too little attention to privately owned businesses.
``They have not gotten much in the way of audit coverage, and this
is where there is lots of room to play games,'' she said, largely
by owners charging personal expenses to the company.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS has long audited sole proprietors closely, but critics
say that small and medium-size corporations and their owners and
executives get less scrutiny. Some IRS officials have also
acknowledged privately that opportunities remain for underreporting
capital gains, which are subject to fewer formal checks than are
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Several tax experts said the new data raised troubling questions
about the equity of the tax system.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will the impact of this shift in audit policy have on
people's long-term faith in our tax system, on people feeling that
others are paying their fair share and I should pay my fair
share?'' asked Susan Long, co-director of Syracuse University's
Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, which obtained the IRS
data.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An audit is begun for many different reasons. In many cases, an
IRS scoring system has identified deductions or other factors on a
return as being far outside statistical norms. Increasingly, the
IRS is picking specific occupations for audits to gather data about
tax-paying patterns. The agency is also selecting more returns for
auditing because of suspicions about the tax preparer whose name is
on the return or because of referrals from other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Audits about simple issues are often handled through the mail,
with taxpayers being asked to justify or explain a line on their
tax return. For more serious questions, taxpayers are asked to come
to the IRS, or an examiner visits their home or business to inspect
records and ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   The agency can refer cases for prosecution if there is evidence
of tax evasion, tax fraud or a variety of nontax crimes, including
money laundering, drug dealing and racketeering. It referred 3,990
cases to the Justice Department last year, down 21 percent from
5,078 in 1993, the clearinghouse said.
</P>
<P>
   Only 514 people were convicted of tax evasion or tax fraud in
1997, down from 594 in 1993, according to the data the
clearinghouse obtained from the Justice Department. Justice
officials cautioned that the actual number of such convictions
might be more or less than the figures in its data base, but they
did not dispute that the number of such cases was small and
decreasing.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecution of tax cheats, long a minor government activity, has
shrunk even more since 1994, other data collected by the
clearinghouse show. Last year, just 766 people were prosecuted for
federal tax crimes, according to data that the administrative
office of U.S. courts gave to the clearing house.
</P>
<P>
   The only way for the IRS to assess the extent of cheating is
through compliance measurement studies, in which individual and
corporate taxpayers are picked at random and required to justify
every entry on their tax returns down to producing marriage
certificates for couples who file jointly. The last such compliance
audits were conducted a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, after hearing complaints about the burdens imposed on
those whose returns were analyzed, in 1995 canceled funding for a
new round of compliance audits.
</P>
<P>
   Long said the data make a case for more aggressive prosecution
of scofflaws. ``If you are involved in large-scale cheating on your
taxes and all you have to do, if you are caught, is pay the money
and some penalty,'' she said, ``it is almost a reward.''
</P>
<P>
   The new IRS audit data cover the period through last Sept. 30.
In the past, publicly disclosed data on IRS enforcement efforts
were typically at least two years old. The fresh data were turned
over to the clearinghouse by Charles O. Rossotti, the computer
industry executive who became IRS commissioner last year.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this data, including details on incomes by state and
county, is available on the Internet at http://trac.syr.edu/
without charge. The clearinghouse also maintains a World Wide Web
site with more detailed information that it sells by subscription.

   &UR; LEARNING HOW TO EAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Food critic &UR; Alan Richman &LR;  writes in the latest issue of GQ
magazine that crusading vegans, easily identified by their pallor,
their grimness and what he perceives as their ``terrifying
alien-like demeanor ... are best avoided.''
</P>
<P>
   Richman is not adamantly anti-vegetarian. ``Macrobiotics, who
share the vegan affinity for food that is colored brown, are kindly
souls who believe in the Zen principle of not irritating everybody
with whom they come in contact,'' he writes. ``The way I see it,
macrobiotics is the art of prolonging life, whereas veganism is the
art of making life not worth prolonging.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ovo-lacto-vegetarians we see around all the time are much
more tolerable. They are actually happier than most people, since
all they ever eat are giant chocolate chip cookies.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. In response to Movieline magazine, which asked  &UR; Liam
Neeson &LR;  to describe the importance of  &UR; Helen Mirren &LR; , his former
lover, ``in your development,'' the actor seemed to call for a
platter of metaphor, consider it and pass it back without
partaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Helen taught me there's more to life than meat, vegetables and
potatoes on a plate,'' said Neeson. ``Literally, I had my first
Chinese meal with her.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TOO HAPPY FOR WORDS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Whitney Houston  &LR; assures Redbook magazine that she and her
husband,  &UR; Bobby Brown &LR; , are ``crazy in love _ love, love, love,
love. When we're fighting, it's like that's love for us. We're
fighting for our love.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that he has hit her are totally untrue, she says.
``Contrary to belief, I do the hitting, he doesn't. He has never
put his hands on me. He wasn't raised that way.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - News Communication, a chain of neighborhood weeklies in New
York, reported that many celebrities, including  &UR; Jesse Jackson &LR;  and
 &UR; Susan Sarandon &LR; , arrested in recent weeks at protests of police
brutality, had assistants call for convenient appointments.
According to the story, which was denied to the New York Post by
the Police Department, Sarandon's assistant called the police to
see how long the arrest would take because ``she has another social
engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   - Producer  &UR; Christopher Peditto  &LR; will release a video version of
``Jane Doe,'' a movie that starred  &UR; Calista Flockhart  &LR; before she
became famous in ``Ally McBeal,'' in June, in order to catch the
ws &LR; ave of publicity that will accompany Flockhart's appearance in
``A Midsummer Night's Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Flockhart plays a drug-addicted misfit. ``This was made pre-nose
job, pre-anorexia ridiculousness,'' Peditto told New York magazine.
</P>
<P>
   - Homeboys go national: San Francisco producer  &UR; Jonathan &LR; 
 &UR; Reinis &LR;  opens ``It Ain't Nothin' But the Blues'' at the Vivian
Beaumont Theater in New York on April 26, two days before the
cut- &LR; off date for Tony eligibility. Reinis' ``Dame Edna's Royal
Tour'' opens in Manhattan in October. And  &UR; Mark Bittner &LR; , the
Telegraph Hill caretaker of a flock of wild parrots, is featured in
this week's People.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a  &UR; Salman Rushdie  &LR; short story in last week's
New Yorker put the Great Quake of San Francisco in October 1984,
which leads  &UR; Judy Reimann &LR;  to debate the relative merits of
literary license and fact checkers.
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Michael Robertson &LR; , reading multiple threats in the past few
weeks to bomb Serbia back to the Stone Age, recommends a kinder,
gentler bombing back to the Renaissance. It just ``sounds nicer,''
says Robertson. ``Frescoes, men in tights,'' that sort of thing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BBC DECIDES THAT `BRITISH' IS OUT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A series of seminars given for BBC staff members was apparently
infiltrated by the Sunday Times of London, which reported on
several caveats:
</P>
<P>
   - The word ``British'' is to be avoided when describing people
living in the British Isles because it might make Scots and Welsh
people feel left out.
</P>
<P>
   - The word ``nation'' is to be used rarely, for what seems to be
the same reason; it implies a unity among the Isles that is not to
be taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   - Subtitles can never be used to make clear what a Scot is
saying, even if it is undecipherable.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``I've never discussed it before. As a child, I used to bite &LR; 
 &UR; my toenails off, you know, instead of clipping them with &LR; 
 &UR; clippers. I was very limber.'' &LR;

living in the British Isles because it might make Scots and Welsh
people feel left out.
</P>
<P>
   - The word ``nation'' is to be used rarely, for what seems to be
the same reason; it implies a unity among the Isles that is not to
be taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   - Subtitles can never be used to make clear what a Scot is
saying, even if it is undecipherable.

HISTORY CHANNEL BEGINS ITS LOOK AT THE CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fact that we can look back on the past hundred years and see
it as it happened, see eyewitnesses talking about things that are
history to us and cherished memories to them, may be what we take
most for granted about this century.
</P>
<P>
   No other period in time can be seen in the oh-so-revealing light
of film and videotape.
</P>
<P>
   What a legacy! Assumptions that video will never match the
breadth and depth of the printed word are being revised as
technology combines the archival capacity of books with the
immediacy and visual impact of film. Just imagine how the next
century will be recorded and remembered.
</P>
<P>
   It's an exercise in fantasy that seems appropriate after the
first two installments of The History Channel's 15{-hour journey
through ``The Century: America's Time,'' which begins Monday night.
This is the ``other'' Peter Jennings/ABC project that takes an
approach more linear than the themed, 12-hour package that
concluded on ABC Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on the rapid advances in technology that greeted the
20th century, Monday night's episodes, which start at 1900 and
conclude with World War I, are nourishing food for thought, given
how the dark side of technology is now on display in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of The History Channel's traditional, documentarian
approach will love this series, rife as it is with interviews of
those who were there, such as a passenger on the Lusitania, a
bodyguard of Lenin or the the next-door neighbors of the Wright
brothers. These people make the stories come alive, and television
makes the people come alive. No matter how familiar the footage,
it's quite a sight.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the entire schedule for ``The Century: America's Time.''
``Seeds of Change'' (1900-1914), Monday night; ``Shell Shock''
(1914-1919), Monday night; ``Boom to Bust'' (1920-1929), Tuesday;
``Stormy Weather'' (1930-1939), Wednesday; ``Over the Edge''
(1936-1941), Thursday; ``Civilians at War'' (1936-1945), Friday
(90-minute episode); ``Homefront'' (1941-1945), April 19; ``Best
Years'' (1946-1952), April 20; ``Happy Days'' (1953-1960), April
21; ``Poisoned Dreams'' (1960-1963), April 22; ``Unpinned''
(1964-1968), April 23; ``Apocalypse Now'' (1969-1975), April 26;
``Starting Over'' (1976-1981), April 27; ``A New World''
(1981-1989), April 28; ``Machine Dreams'' (the 1990s), April 29.
Repeats will begin with episodes 1-6 this Sunday, and continue with
episodes 7-11 on April 25 and episodes 12-15 on May 2.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Media and Public Affairs reports that, of the Big
Three networks, ABC seems the most negative toward U.S./NATO
involvement in Kosovo. Based on 208 stories broadcast over the
first eight days of NATO bombing, the center said reports on ``ABC
World News Tonight'' were the most critical, with 37 percent of
statements from news sources supporting U.S. policy and 63 percent
opposed. ``NBC Nightly News'' was considered ``generally balanced''
(54 percent yea, 46 percent nay), and ``CBS Evening News'' heavily
supportive, with 67 percent of source comments in favor and 33
percent opposed. ... Imagine the pillow talk: Gerry Sheindlin will
replace Edward Koch as presiding judge on ``The People's Court''
next season. Sheindlin is the husband of Judith ``Judge Judy''
Sheindlin, currently the top-rated arbiter of right and wrong on
daytime TV. ... Helen Hunt will direct the series finale of ``Mad
About You.'' The hourlong farewell episode, scheduled May 24 at 9
p.m., will have Janeane Garofalo playing a grown-up version of Paul
and Jamie Buchman's daughter, Mabel. ... It was inevitable. After
years of gathering around the water cooler, TV characters would
eventually have to go to the bathroom. But the guys-at-the-urinal
shot has become the overused cliche of choice this season among
devotees of TV-verite. It was spoofed hilariously last week in
Comedy Central's new ``Strangers With Candy,'' when two men
introduced themselves and actually shook hands while ... well, you
get the idea. Everywhere else on TV, however, it's becoming a key
part of story exposition, as if we all need to know that Dr. Greene
on ``ER'' or Andy Sipowicz on ``NYPD Blue'' prefer the urinal on
the left. What's next? Ben Stiller's zip-up accident from ``There's
Something About Mary?''

   WASHINGTON _ Sheppie Abramowitz barely had time to toss aside
her red slouch-brim hat before she was working the telephone _
cajoling and hectoring administration officials to do favors big
and small for the masses of Kosovo refugees who now wander the
earth in despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found the guy,'' she hurriedly told a fellow refugee worker
who needed her to root out a specialist in the federal maw. ``Now
we'll figure out how to do it,'' she added, ending the call with
the clipped determination of a bookmaker used to long odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shamelessly squeezing people I know in the
administration,'' Mrs. Abramowitz explained without a scrap of
apology. She is in her fourth decade of work on the harrowing
refugee problems she first encountered on the ground in the Vietnam
era, when she was a foreign-service spouse volunteering for what
has mushroomed into a passionate career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I have a sense of propriety and don't overdo it,'' Mrs.
Abramowitz added, lightening her brassy, voice with a blink of
innocence. Actually, her friends in the field say the art of
Sheppie Abramowitz is to know precisely when to overdo it, and with
whom, in working the amorphous capital underbrush where government
and humanitarian relief organizations overlap.
</P>
<P>
   Her title is vice president of the International Rescue
Committee, one of the private refugee aid organizations with years
of experience in the human disasters of the Balkans. But Mrs.
Abramowitz, a lean, scrappy figure with salt-and-pepper hair, has
the larger reputation of canny pest and benevolent fixer. She
trafficks in a deep knowledge of diplomats and administration
workers to hack away at red tape and bolster refugee services in
the field, where, she insists, the true relief workers are.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a young person's game,'' said the 63-year-old relief
strategist, dropping the names not of the celebrated Washington
officials she regularly strokes and prods but of a dozen field
specialists and relief organizations she finds more deserving of
attention. It is this connection to both worlds that colleagues
rate as her singular strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something goes nuclear, as Kosovo has, and you have to
deal with a broader group of people in this town, Sheppie is so
much more an authority than the 20-somethings, bless all their
work,'' said Mark Malloch-Brown, a vice president and refugee
specialist with the World Bank. He first encountered Mrs.
Abramowitz two decades ago when she led a caravan of embassy wives
in providing first-hand help in the Cambodian refugee camps in
Thailand, where her husband, Morton I. Abramowitz, was ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   ``A spectacular amateur,'' said Malloch-Brown of Ms. Abramowitz,
who quickly became known as the Bangkok embassy person to see about
refugees. ``I've watched her grow and grow and grow to be one the
great champions, one of the handful who can affect policy and
really knows this issue at the field level.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyperkinetic with the Kosovo disaster, Mrs. Abramowitz seems
appalled by praise. She prefers to discuss how long-running refugee
crises in Sudan, Afghanistan and beyond must not be overlooked as
Kosovo flames up.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about herself, Mrs. Abramowitz pauses warily and then
offers the simplest summary of her life: ``I was unformed, and
refugees became a passion.''
</P>
<P>
   She met her future husband while she worked as a congressional
aide after graduating from Bryn Mawr College. Their first foreign
service posting was Taiwan in 1959, then Hong Kong where she began
dabbling in the cause, helping mainland Chinese refugees learn
``hotel English'' to get jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a passion for both of us,'' she said of herself and
her husband, who is retired from the State Department but is an
advocate on the refugee issue. It engulfed both of them in Thailand
and in Turkey, where Abramowitz was ambassador during the Kurd
refugee crisis. ``Mort offers advice, but whether we follow it
depends on how desperate we are,'' she added with equanimity.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Baltimore, where her father ran a record store, Mrs.
Abramowitz is proud that well before she faced the sufferings of
Cambodians and Kurds, her mother, Ida Glass, set the flame in her.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother worked for refugees in the Second World War,'' she
said, recalling German Jewish families living in her house. ``I
come by this very rightly.''
</P>
<P>
   She of course exploits her famous brother, Philip Glass, the
composer. ``He does great fund-raisers for our cause,'' adding that
her other brother, Marty, a businessman, ``puts up with all this.''
Her two grown children, Rachel and Michael, were raised on
volunteer refugee work.
</P>
<P>
   Her office, four blocks from the White House, is a babel of
assorted refugee causes and aid workers coming and going.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to hear me do my number right now, but remember,
I don't really like being a bully,'' she said before another phone
call in which she pressed a friend for the gist of a government
meeting on Kosovo refugees. ``I heard it from the Pentagon,'' she
persisted, flashing a trump card that produced success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me? A bully?'' she later trilled self-mockingly. To a
departing visitor Sheppie Abramowitz offered a farewell that verged
from amiable to bullying: ``Now you guys must continue to press in
on this refugee story, right?''

3 INDUSTRIES PASS TESTS FOR YEAR 2000 COMPUTER GLITCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: N.J., Pa., Md.) (See also FAA-Y2K, Y2K-LAWSUITS) 
(js) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three major industries racing to prepare their computers for the
Year 2000 _ securities, electric utilities and the airlines _ all
passed important testing milestones in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   The securities industry's test, which has been conducted on
weekends since early March, went through its single most important
phase on Saturday, when it simulated Monday, Jan. 3, 2000, the
first trading day next Year and the first day in the test to handle
both new trading and settlement of previous trades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went extremely well,'' said John Panchery, the Year 2000
project manager for the Securities Industry Association. All of the
participating exchanges and the organizations that provide them
with clearing and other back-office services _ the backbone of the
$270 billion industry _ came through without any Year 2000
glitches, Panchery said. Results for individual brokers were not
available yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street tests are the most thorough performed by any
industry to deal with the inability of some computers to recognize
that ``00'' as a two-digit date means 2000. The tests involve
several hundred firms, virtually every type of equity they trade,
and, in most cases, the same equipment and software they use to do
business during the week.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Federal Aviation Agency focused on just one
airport _ Denver International _ and one flight in its test
Saturday night of air traffic control, but the test was hailed as a
reassuring success for an industry that many had seen as lagging
far behind the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
   The electric utility industry's simulation was not so much a
Year 2000 test as a drill of how it would deal with a Year 2000
disaster. More than 200 utilities in Canada and the United States
conducted exercises on Friday to see how they would respond to the
loss of voice and data communications that they normally rely on to
monitor power production and distribution. Without such
information, local utilities and then the power grids over which
electricity flows between states could become unbalanced, leading
to widespread blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   During the exercises, utilities switched to radio and satellite
communication systems and focused on making sure that the minimum
amount of information to keep electricity flowing was being passed
from substations and power plants to utility control rooms, from
the utilities to regional control centers such as the PJM
Interconnection (for Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland) in
Norristown, Pa., and among the regional centers.
</P>
<P>
   It will take several weeks to gather all of the data. The drill
was described as successful, but it clearly pointed to a number of
minor problems that need further attention, according to Eugene
Gorzelnik, a spokesman for the North American Reliability Council.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among the concerns utilities reported: field staff with
out-of-date phone numbers; radio antennae in locations that provide
poor coverage, and employees unable to operate recently purchased
satellite systems.
</P>
<P>
   The drill was conducted alongside normal operations and did not
involve changes to actual generating and transmission equipment.
Many utilities have previously moved power plant computers into the
Year 2000 to make sure that they would not be tripped by the
transition and some have left them there. Some utilities, like
Public Service Electric and Gas in New Jersey, plan to move the
computers on much of their equipment forward to the Year 2000 in
stages this year so that only a small percentage will make the date
transition on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most revealing problem reported in the three
industry tests was a telephone problem affecting the securities
traders that had nothing to do with whether computers will
correctly handle Year 2000 dates. A breakdown in a device that
controls phone traffic into computers at the National Securities
Clearing Corporation on Friday was not repaired before the industry
test began on Saturday. It delayed entries of trading and
bookkeeping information for an undetermined number of firms for
several hours, according to Panchery.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of equipment problems are common, and although we
hadn't planned on it during the test, we got to work on our
contingency plans,'' said Panchery. In a sign of the times,
Clearing Corp. was unable to immediately get all of the incoming
traffic transferred to its backup phone lines because Bell Atlantic
had them tied up in some independent Year 2000 testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not much time left and everyone is rushing to get
their testing done,'' Panchery said.

COMMENTARY: THE EAGER BEAVERS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After four of the blossoming Japanese cherry trees
on the edge of the Tidal Basin mysteriously were hacked down, park
police laid in wait at night to catch the vandals.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the midnight marauders reappeared: A band of three
beavers, sharp front teeth at the ready, swam up out of the murky
shallows to ``harvest'' the trees again in the furtherance of their
unauthorized federal dam project.
</P>
<P>
   This led to a fierce clash of interests between
environmentalists (``Save the trees!'') and animal-rights activists
(``Save the beavers!''). One lesson: In natural struggles for
survival, as in political relations between powers, painful
priorities must be imposed and ameliorating compromises made.
</P>
<P>
   Another lesson taught in the defense of Beauty (the blossoms in
their springtime glory) against the attack of Truth (the beavers
instinctively demonstrating the validity of their work ethic) was
this: Do not demonize your opponents when they want to let you lose
with honor.
</P>
<P>
   Let us consider the way President Clinton handled the visit of
China's remarkable prime minister, Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu's goal was to gain our support for China's admission to the
World Trade Organization. He was willing to make some concessions
about opening his protected markets to U.S. exporters, but
unwilling to stop the campaign to crush all attempts to form a
democracy in Communist China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's goal was to accept the commercial easements _ while
paying lip service to human rights _ and make the deal. But at the
last minute he double-crossed his own trade negotiators and
embarrassed Zhu by scuttling the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   John Sweeney, head of the AFL-CIO, who wants protection from
cheap Chinese goods, is why. In years past, Clinton could afford to
ignore Sweeney's protectionism, as well as liberal Democrats who
have seen how trade has led only to more repression. That's because
he had the support of business-dominated Republicans on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   But now that callous business-is-business support is eroding.
The stolen nuclear secrets and the funneling of Chinese money into
his stolen election make Republicans nervous, thereby giving
Sweeney much more leverage on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In scuttling the deal, Clinton needed someone to blame. It
couldn't be Zhu; he had come a long way on trade. Couldn't be labor
or human-rights liberals who saved him from removal. Certainly
couldn't be himself, although his easy assumption of GOP dogma that
trade would lead to freedom had backfired. He decided to take the
vast-right-wing-conspiracy route.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit? ``The anti-China crowd in America,'' he said, had a
notion ``that if someone wants to have a relationship with us, they
should agree with us about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   How's that for polarizing rhetoric?
</P>
<P>
   He has now divided Americans who think about China at all into
``the anti-China crowd'' of simpletons vs. _ who? The mirror image
would be ``a pro-China crowd in America that thinks that if we want
to have a relationship with someone, we should agree with them
about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Such foolish oratory makes impossible a realistic American
attitude toward China. It invites us back to the who-lost-China,
pre-Nixon days of isolation and hostility.
</P>
<P>
   We who are now labeled by our president ``the anti-China crowd''
are indeed anti-Communist, but believe we must deal with Beijing
across a range of fronts, using trade and cultural contacts as
levers for diplomatic compromise and political progress. Trade is
good, but it is not all, and we have seen in China and Russia how
its profits can be misused by a power elite to stunt the growth of
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   We can combat China's penetration of our labs without rancor,
and expect Beijing to understand an improvement of our surveillance
of their military. But we should exhibit outrage at the subversion
of our political process with foreign money; that's beyond the pale
of national competition, and when added to sustained cultural
aggression in Tibet and missile intimidation of Taiwan, causes
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-China crowd disagrees. (See? It's so easy to pin a
pejorative label on opponents.) We'll have to await a new president
for a subtly realistic approach that China will respect.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the anti-beaver crowd has humanely trapped the
predators of our cherry trees. The eager rodents will be released
in the wilds of Maryland. Tidal Basin blossoms are safe. Spring is
possible.

 &HT;    Last is best for Braves _ again
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The first week means nothing, but the first week can
suggest everything. The Atlanta Braves are off on the season's
longest road trip having learned something about their new mix over
the season's first seven days that may serve them for months.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones' two-run single off Gregg Olson with one out in the
ninth Sunday gave Atlanta its second last at-bat victory in three
days, the Braves beating the suddenly competitive Arizona
Diamondbacks 3-2 in a game they had every right to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're not swinging the bats good and you win a game like
that, it's a good sign,'' first baseman Ryan Klesko said.
</P>
<P>
   The first week ends with a 4-3 record against two teams _
Philadelphia and Arizona _ coming off losing seasons. Yet the
Braves showed resourcefulness to reap what they have. After going
2-46 last season when trailing after eight innings, they already
have matched that win total in two outings against Olson, Arizona's
woeful closer who now has three blown saves in three appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not my fault,'' said Jones, who also won Friday's night
game with a 10th-inning RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel fortunate to win two out of three, to be honest with
you,'' manager Bobby Cox said, ``because they shut us down pretty
good.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for smooth beginnings. The season's first homestand saw
reliever Mike Remlinger's back injury, Mark Wohlers' wreck and the
Braves come within a few precious at-bats of losing all three to
the Diamondbacks. The top three spots in the order are batting .178
and the reigning Cy Young winner is 0-2 with a 7.11 earned run
average.
</P>
<P>
   Yet down 2-0 Sunday because of a domineering performance by
Arizona starter Todd Stottlemyre (eight scoreless innings, four
hits), the Braves responded.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Kevin McGlinchy pitched a scoreless eighth in relief of
Greg Maddux, who had yielded home runs to Travis Lee and Luis
Gonzalez. The Braves loaded the bases in the ninth without a hit (a
Jay Bell error and two 3-2 walks by Olson) before Jones delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize how much was on the line when I got out
there,'' said McGlinchy, who wound up with his first career win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not swinging the bats real well, except a couple of
guys,'' said Ozzie Guillen, who hit the line drive that Bell
dropped to open the ninth. ``So when you're not hitting that well,
you have to be aggressive on the bases and play good defense. And
if the pitching is tough and we keep doing what we're doing right
now, we have a chance.

 &HT;    Club awaits word on Wohlers' choice toward the future
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The next chapter in the Mark Wohlers saga begins
today, when the reliever is scheduled to accept or decline the
Braves' designation to a minor-league assignment.
</P>
<P>
   How life unfolds after that, general manager John Schuerholz
said, ``I don't have any idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Opinion varies throughout the majors on Wohlers' best course
toward the future _ making a clean start somewhere else or trying
to rekindle spring's early success in the minors. But the club's
initial assurance that he was willing to remain with the Braves has
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sounds like he's giving serious thought to a very serious
matter,'' said Schuerholz, who talked with Wohlers over the
weekend. ``This is a very big decision in his life, which has a lot
of variables to it. And I understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   If Wohlers declines the assignment, the Braves have 10 days to
deal with his contract. Although Arizona and Pittsburgh are
reportedly interested in Wohlers, the contract disposition becomes
a central issue. By releasing him, the Braves would become solely
responsible for the $6 million he has coming ($5.2 million in 1999
salary and another $800,000 buyout for a 2000 option year).
</P>
<P>
   The best-case scenario becomes a trade, not that far-fetched
given the current state of relief pitching in the majors. The
Braves could hope Wohlers creates a market _ 100 mph fastballs with
seven years major-league experience are a commodity.
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz rejected the idea that Wohlers has no option than to
leave the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why it would be impossible for him to stay
here,'' he said. ``Some might think it'd be more likely he'd
remain, with the support group that's in place and the
understanding everybody has of his troubles. Some other place may
be new and fresh but they may not have the understanding of his
situation that exists here.''
</P>
<P>
   Brrrrrr. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are off on a trip Federal Express wouldn't take, from
Philadelphia to Colorado to Los Angeles to Florida. Fashions run
from beachwear to apres-ski.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trip is kind of messed up,'' Andruw Jones said. ``We're
going to Philadelphia. Cold. Colorado. Cold. Florida. Maybe cold.
It's tough but that's part of baseball. Whatever schedule you have,
you have to play, but in my three years, we've never had as bad a
road trip.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have been snowed out on the road in each of the past
two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Wall ball
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan is still feeling the effects of a Friday night
collision with the right-field wall. He sat out the last two
innings of Saturday night's game to avoid aggravating his right
shoulder, which he slammed into the screen protecting the
scoreboard while trying to chase down a Tony Batista double.

 &HT;    Kyle helps improve luck of Pettys
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bristol, Tenn. _ Only three of Richard Petty's 200 career
victories came at Bristol Motor Speedway, so the family's dislike
of the half-mile oval is understandable.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Kyle Petty said they should fill the facility
with water and use it for bass fishing tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's Food City 500, however, the first family of
stock-car racing saw its luck change. Kyle, who didn't finish
higher than 31st with two DNQs in the past five races, finished
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   John Andretti, who drives the other Petty Pontiac, was fourth,
his best finish of the season and in 16 races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still hate Bristol, but I love the finish,'' Andretti said.
Earnhardt moves up
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt, relegated to the back of the field to start
after wrecking his primary car Saturday, did some of his best
driving of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, using a backup car, had only 10 practice laps in the
car Saturday. He finished 10th, moving up 28 positions in the first
136 laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty good for unloading off the truck and not changing
any springs,'' he said. ``We were scared to. We were scared to go
adjusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Swirvin' Irvan
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take Ernie Irvan long to find a wall. Only 10 laps
into the race, Irvan hit the outside wall on the backstretch and
then caromed into the pit-road wall.
</P>
<P>
   Irvan's crew spent 187 laps repairing his No. 36 Pontiac before
he returned to the track on lap 197, without the front end of his
car. Irvan finished 43rd and fell eight spots in the point
standings to 23rd.
</P>
<P>
   Tricky Dick
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Dick Trickle had one of the busier afternoons. During
lap 107, Trickle tried to pass Ricky Rudd but smashed the
passenger-side door on Rudd's No. 10 Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got caught in traffic and I guess some of the guys behind me
got a little antsy, racing like it was the last lap,'' said Rudd,
who was running seventh. Trickle later bumped Dale Jarrett's No. 88
Ford in turn 4 of lap 117. That tap caused slight damage to the
right side of Jarrett's car. Trickle then hit Jerry Nadeau's No. 9
Ford under a caution on lap 295.

 &HT;    Wallace avoids Bristol wreckage
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Tenn. _ Rusty Wallace was about the only contender to
avoid all the debris in Sunday's Food City 500 at Bristol Motor
Speedway. Luckily, he was able to speed past his final obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   After Wallace narrowly beat Mark Martin to the finish for his
seventh victory here, he completed a ``Polish victory lap,''
driving backward on the half-mile oval to honor late NASCAR driver
Alan Kulwicki, who died in a plane crash at an airport only miles
from the speedway in April 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace won the race three days after Kulwicki's death, after
which he duplicated Kulwicki's signature celebration, which the
late driver introduced during his 1992 Winston Cup championship
season.
</P>
<P>
   But Wallace's first ride in reverse at Bristol wasn't nearly as
exciting as Sunday's.
</P>
<P>
   As Wallace left the front straightaway, track officials opened
the gates, allowing spectators to cross the track from the infield.
Fortunately, Wallace's No. 2 Ford Taurus left turn 3 into the
backstretch just as spectators started to cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Kulwicki) started it and then I did it, and then everybody
did it,'' Wallace said. ``Then everybody just stopped doing it and
started doing doughnuts through the infield and stupid stuff like
that. It just irritated the hell out of me. I finally got to do it
the way I meant to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But fans on the track weren't supposed to be included.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came around three and people started running over there to
stop them,'' he said. ``That would have been a bad deal. They were
trying to beat the rush home, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   The scary episode on his victory lap was nothing new for
Wallace, who barely escaped several close calls throughout the
500-lap race, the first Winston Cup event on a short track this
season.
</P>
<P>
   With only 26 laps remaining, Steve Park spun his No. 1 Chevy
into the wall in turn 2, giving the leaders a final pit stop.
Wallace, who led 425 laps, entered pit road with the lead and left
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett lost third place to Martin after his right-front
tire changer had problems during the pit stop. Jarrett was forced
to take only two tires and never threatened after the restart on
lap 482.
</P>
<P>
   That left a two-car duel. Martin attempted to pass three times
in the final 18 laps. His best opportunity came with four laps
left, when Wallace nearly rear-ended the lapped car of rookie
Buckshot Jones of Tucker, who had slowed on the backstretch. But
Wallace squeezed by Jones' No. 00 Pontiac, but not before taking a
tap in the rear from Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark was so strong at the end I didn't know if I was going to
hold him off or not,'' Wallace said. ``It was just a lapped car at
that point, and the lapped cars were racing the leaders pretty
hard. I just had to make a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to go around the top side, but (Jones) looked like
he was going to the bottom or the top. ... As I was going to the
top, Mark was going to fly underneath me. I pulled back down so
abruptly that Mark ended up tapping me in the rear a little bit. It
was a real tight deal. It was pretty hairy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the hairiest scene came with 160 laps remaining. As the
leaders left turns 1 and 2, the lapped car of Jerry Nadeau spun out
and into the outside wall. Wallace exited before Nadeau's No. 9
Ford started collecting cars, but rookie Tony Stewart and Jeff
Gordon, who were running second and third at the time,
respectively, weren't as fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who had won four spring races in a row at Bristol, took
the brunt of the damage. Robert Pressley's No. 77 Ford smashed the
front of Gordon's No. 24 Chevy. Stewart spun out and nearly missed
the accident, but Ricky Craven's No. 58 Ford hit the rear of his
No. 20 Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
   Both Stewart and Gordon made three pit stops during the 10-lap
caution, and they returned at 13th and 14th, respectively, at the
restart with 150 laps remaining. Stewart's problems got worse 41
laps later, however, when he bumped Mike Skinner's No. 31 Chevy,
cutting Stewart's left rear tire. Stewart had to make an
unscheduled pit stop and lost two laps.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart later regained a lap, but finished 15th. Gordon
rebounded to finish sixth, behind Martin, Jarrett, John Andretti
and Jeff Burton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy that caused half the yellows today finally took us
out,'' Stewart said. ``(Nadeau) was bound and determined he was
going to crash some good cars and he did. By the time I saw
everything, and it's hard when you're behind other cars, all I saw
was the No. 9 car sideways _ I think for the third time during the
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart and Gordon weren't the only contenders who were hurt by
lapped cars. During the 248th lap, Pressley spun out on the
backstretch and took out Bobby Labonte, who entered the race
trailing points leader Burton by only two points. Labonte's No. 18
Pontiac sustained significant damage and he finished 37th, 29 laps
behind the top 10 finishing cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just a victim of circumstance,'' Labonte said. ``It
seems like everytime we come to Bristol we have something like that
happen. We were running good. That's short-track racing and that's
Bristol for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte fell to third in points, 105 behind Burton. Jarrett took
over second, while Wallace jumped to eighth, trailing Burton by
173.

 &HT;    Late rounds ideal for special teams
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the past five years, a period encompassing all the
seven-round drafts in NFL history, only five kickers and six
punters have been selected. But that doesn't mean teams aren't
taking plenty of special-teams players.
</P>
<P>
   In this era of the salary cap, every team needs some cheap
laborers, so clubs must be more selective even on their late-round
picks. Those sixth- and seventh-rounders usually make the roster
and are expected to contribute immediately by playing special
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can find in the late rounds an offensive lineman or
maybe a tight end who's able to deep-snap or a receiver with
potential as a return guy, it gives you an edge,'' New Orleans
special teams coach Bobby April said. ``If there's an exceptional
return man, you might see him go even higher.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the case in '98, when the Atlanta Falcons used a
fourth-round pick to take Tim Dwight, the mighty-mite return
specialist. In retrospect, it was one of the best ``value'' choices
of the draft.
</P>
<P>
   The top returners in the '99 draft _ wide receivers Torry Holt
(North Carolina State), David Boston (Ohio State) and Troy Edwards
(Louisiana Tech) and tailback Kevin Faulk (LSU) _ are standouts as
well at their primary positions and will be off the board after the
second round. But scouts also are aware of middle- and
late-rounders with special-teams prowess.
</P>
<P>
   One AFC Central team lists Florida fullback Terry Jackson among
the top all-around special teams players in this draft. Michigan
State safety Sorie Kanu lacks speed and has battled knee problems,
but is superb on kick coverage units. Texas offensive tackle Jay
Humphrey is just an average blocker but a solid deep-snapper.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father has preached to me that the more you can do, the
more reason a team has to keep you around,'' said Humphrey, the son
of former Kansas City center Tom Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   That said, it's a player who does just one thing but does it
well who figures to be the first special-teams player selected.
Kansas State's Martin Gramatica may be one of the premier kicking
prospects of this decade, and could be chosen as high as the third
or fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has an extremely strong leg, and when you look at his size,
you wonder where (the power) is coming from,'' said Chiefs
personnel director Terry Bradway. ``He gives you an added weapon of
field position.

 &HT;    Gruesome twosome tees off first
 &HT;    By Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ On Sunday, golfers all over the country squeezed
in 18 holes and lunch before the Masters leaders teed off.
</P>
<P>
   So did Bob Tway and Trevor Immelman. Only they played Augusta
National.
</P>
<P>
   Off in the first twosome of the day, Tway, the former PGA champ
who grew up in Marietta, and Immelman, the young South African
amateur, played a relaxed, almost obligatory round. They seemed in
a different time zone than the guys 4 1/2 hours behind and 17 shots
ahead of them. As a small knot of loyal family members and friends
watched, they played past blithely curious spectators who seemed a
little surprised to see them appear out of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   A few steps behind the lawn mowers, hole cutters and leaf
blowers, Tway and Immelman teed off at 10:30 a.m., the first of 28
twosomes. There were more people in the gift shop than on the first
tee.
</P>
<P>
   The players chatted as they headed up the first fairway. As this
field's rabbits, the course stretched out before them. No waits on
any tee. No fairway divots. No spike marks.
</P>
<P>
   Both bogeyed the first hole.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first of many firsts. First in the azaleas was
Immelman on No. 2, en route to the first unplayable lie of the day
and the first double bogey of the Masters final round.
</P>
<P>
   With Tway squinting like Chipper Jones and Immelman looking as
if he might cry, the two struggled. Immelman was 5-over after 4
holes, eliciting the first crowd murmur of the day when his iron
into No. 4 dropped like a dead bird, 40 yards short of the green.
</P>
<P>
   Tway, continuing his weeklong frustrating story line, couldn't
get a putt to drop. The first cheer of the day erupted behind them
when Mark Brooks birdied.
</P>
<P>
   Their supporters didn't feel too great, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are just getting through today,'' said Jim
Ferguson, a neighbor of Tway's in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not much fun to be in last place,'' added Kaye Anderson,
Tway's mother, who lives in Marietta. Only a low number today would
vault him into the top 16 and ensure an invitation back to Augusta
next year. So at this point, all he was playing for was more prize
money and, like Immelman, pride.
</P>
<P>
   But only the weather heated up, as the sun burned through and
the occasional whiff of Coppertone drifted through the crowds near
the popular observation points. Some people watched absent-mindedly
over their course maps, as they figured out what group they really
wanted to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Fans had clustered there for hours, so Tammie Tway couldn't see
all her husband's shots. But the views were still a lot better than
when he played with David Duval the first two rounds, and wide open
compared to 13 years ago, when Tway played in front of a charging
Jack Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cheers were so loud that day,'' she recalled. ``And then
when they'd post his score, there'd be another roar.''
</P>
<P>
   A smattering of applause greeted Immelman's short birdie putt on
No. 7, the group's first red number of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Johan Immelman thought the early pairing would help his
19-year-old son. If he put up a good score, he might make up six
shots and become the low amateur. But by No. 13, Johan had recorded
26 putts by Trevor on a crumpled slip of paper, a measure of his
misery. He certainly wouldn't make the midnight Masters telecast in
Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
   From watching TV, Johan Immelman knew huge crowds surrounded the
Masters leaders. He didn't expect anyone to be out this early, but
then again, he didn't expect the thousands of fans who show up for
the practice rounds. ``It's phenomenal,'' he said. ``It's really
impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment wasn't returned by diehard Masters fans. Seeing
Tway and Immelman approach was a little like watching the warm-up
band at a general admission concert. Spectators had to get there
early to save a good spot, but they didn't come to see these guys
play.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the 18th green looked ghostly, with few fans dotting
the ocean of chairs. In 22 years seated pin-high, Dee Kiefer can't
remember a memorable shot by the earliest arrivals. Her record was
safe as Tway parred for a 74 and Immelman bogeyed for 79.
</P>
<P>
   To see good golf, said the bank vice president from Indiana,
``We've still got a long way to go.'' She patted a bag under her
seat. ``I just want to get all my snacks ready so I don't have to
leave after this.

REJUVENATED RUELASES CAN'T STAY AWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It happens to virtually all boxers.
</P>
<P>
   They intend to retire but succumb to the powerful lure of the
ring and return. They miss the competition, the thrill of the
crowds, the purpose the sport brings to their lives and, often, the
money.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's Gabriel and Rafael Ruelas' turn.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared the former world champions from Sylmar had had
enough last year, when they both took the worst beatings of their
careers, Gabriel against John Brown and Rafael against Kostya
Tszyu.
</P>
<P>
   And when they intimated it was time to walk away, many of those
closest to them were relieved, particularly in the case of Rafael,
who has taken a lot of punches because of his aggressive style.
</P>
<P>
   The Ruelases understand the concern and appreciate it.
</P>
<P>
   However, they, like so many of their brethren, must prove to
themselves it's over. And the only way to do that, at least in
their minds, is to give it another try.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Gabriel is only 28 and Rafael will be 28 on April 26
_ young by any standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like anyone who retires from something they love doing,''
Gabriel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm giving myself one more chance. Then, if I don't put my
heart into it like I should, that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel, the WBC super featherweight champion in 1994 and 1995,
is coming back in good part because he doesn't like the way he went
out.
</P>
<P>
   He said his motivation waned after he outpointed James Leija to
win the title in September 1994 because he had realized his dream.
Then, when Jimmy Garcia died from Ruelas' punches the following
year, it appeared the joy he once found in boxing was lost.
</P>
<P>
   His fights showed it. With the exception of a memorable brawl
against Arturo Gatti, he never again fought with the fire of his
early career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like I was going through the motions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after Brown stopped him in eight rounds in October, he
spent five-plus months without boxing . . . and he couldn't handle
it.
</P>
<P>
   He had dabbled in selling real estate. He has been involved in
the establishment of a Boys' and Girls' Club gym in Hollywood. He's
gone to therapy ever since the Garcia fight. And he's had time to
spend with his family.
</P>
<P>
   However, it wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   He suspects he remains a world-class fighter. He sees boxers
succeeding who he knows he could handle. And, although he says
money isn't motivating him now, the financial rewards are
substantial.
</P>
<P>
   All he had to do was walk into Joe Goossen's Van Nuys gym a few
weeks ago for a light workout and the desire began to creep back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize now more than ever that you have to be hungry to
win,'' said Gabriel. ``I want to get back (mentally) to the days
when I didn't care about money, when I just really loved what I was
doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling that way, now. I just want to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafael, who held the IBF lightweight title in 1994 and 1995, had
been studying financial planning at UCLA and still plans to make
his living in the business world.
</P>
<P>
   He simply missed competition. Now, he's putting his
second-career plans on hold and has been working out in Goossen's
gym every day for the past week and a half.
</P>
<P>
   And he's not deterred after his performance against Tszyu, in
which he took many punches and was knocked out in the ninth round
in August.
</P>
<P>
   He believes fighters are judged primarily on their last
performance. A few (begin ital)good(end ital) performances, he
said, could change the perception and open some doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate people who care about me,'' he said. ``I care
about (begin ital)myself(end ital) ultimately more than anybody
else. I have a kid on the way (wife, Michelle, is four months
pregnant). I want to be a healthy daddy. I want to be able to raise
my kid properly and with all my senses.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I'm going to devote myself to (training) completely
and if I don't get good results, then just step back out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel and Rafael, who won't be ready to fight for several
months, could end up on the same card for their ``comeback''
fights.
</P>
<P>
   That could bring back memories of the days in which two
exciting, young fighters thrilled audiences by routinely knocking
off overmatched opponents on the same night. If it doesn't, as they
promised, then they'll know it's time to give up _ permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Goossen-Camacho?: P.J. Goossen won't believe he's going to fight
Hector Camacho until the two step into the ring June 18, the date
upon which the junior middleweight matchup is tentatively
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   And no can blame the North Hollywood resident for having his
doubts: He's had that kind of career.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: He's had hand injuries that have caused long gaps in
his career; he was stabbed in the chest when he was jumped at a
party and missed several more months, he said; and, most
significantly, he broke his foot four days before he was scheduled
to fight Roberto Duran in South Africa in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Duran fight was the big opportunity Goossen, 28, dreamed of
throughout his seven years as a professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about
that,'' said Goossen, who is 19-1, with 13 knockouts. ``That would
have made me or broke me. I would've found out what my future was
in boxing. Instead, I've just continued to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more than eager to go.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Camacho fight, which has been in the works for at
least six months, is so important to him.
</P>
<P>
   It's against one of the biggest names in the sport and on ESPN2.
If he wins _ a big if _ he could position himself for a big-money
fight and a shot at a world title. More importantly, his career
would've amounted to something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm knocking on the door and no one will let me in,'' said
Goossen, who is trained and managed by his father, Pat Goossen.
``I've had thoughts about giving up. I've come this far, though.
Why give up now? Five years from now, I'd regret it.
</P>
<P>
   ``To finally get in the ring with one of the legends, someone
everyone knows, would be great, just great.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Acre, Camacho's promoter, said only ESPN2 _ which is
scheduled to televise the bout _ could veto the matchup, but Acre
has no reason to believe the network would.
</P>
<P>
   For Goossen's sake, let's hope not.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: WBO featherweight champion Naseem Hamed had
trouble with Paul Ingle before stopping him in the 11th round
Saturday in England.
</P>
<P>
   Paul who?
</P>
<P>
   Exactly. Are we starting to understand that Hamed is more hype
than substance?
</P>
<P>
   Hamed said he thinks he broke his hand in the bout. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The HBO card Saturday in Indio isn't going to attract too much
attention, but it's an excellent one.
</P>
<P>
   IBF lightweight champ Shane Mosley faces Brown _ who proved
against Gabriel Ruelas that he's tough _ and Ivan Robinson faces
Angel Manfredy in a bout sure to packed with action. . . .
</P>
<P>
   We'll see tonight at the Forum whether Jesse Magana, the former
No. 1 WBO junior featherweight contender, has anything left.
</P>
<P>
   Magana has lost three of four since he was knocked out by Marco
Antonio Barrera in September 1996 and hasn't fought since June.
</P>
<P>
   Only one thing is certain: Magana is as game as they come.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the card, Mauricio Martinez defends his NABO
bantamweight title against Ulises Morquecho. &QL;

<P>
   MOSCOW _ The NATO bombing of Yugoslavia may or may not free the
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, but a thousand miles away, it has
already had a profoundly liberating effect. After eight
long-suffering years, it is once again acceptable _ even de rigueur
_ for Russians to dislike Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Enough Russians have embraced animosity, and with such sudden
fervor, that some experts here say it threatens to become the
guiding force in a relationship with little else going for it.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Americanism is not universal _ not by a long shot _ but in
this cosmopolitan capital, the shift in public sentiment in the
three weeks since the NATO bombing began has been both swift and
palpable. It is not rare for Americans to be denounced or harassed
on the street.
</P>
<P>
   The mainstream Moscow newspaper, Komsomolskaya Pravda, captured
the prickly nature of popular feeling this week in a full-page
article bearing the eye-catching headline ``This is the way we
shoot down Americans! Yugoslav pilots share their first combat
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nationwide survey of 1,600 Russians, the All-Russian Center
for Public Opinion Studies concluded that only 39 percent of
respondents felt positively about the United States in March,
compared with 67 percent just three months earlier. The share of
Russians who said their view of America was ``mainly bad'' or
``very bad'' more than doubled, from 23 percent to 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Communist-trained political class has always held the
United States in low regard, said Andre Piontovsky, a well-known
political analyst here. But never _ until now _ has the contempt
made the leap to large segments of the general public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anti-Americanism really may be becoming the Russian national
idea that we have been searching for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many would dispute that. Like much of the world, Russia seems to
carry on a love-hate relationship with the United States, envying
its wealth and power while soaking up its culture and exports.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no doubt that anti-American feelings are what is
currently driving Russian policy, both foreign and domestic.
</P>
<P>
   The welling up of anti-Americanism has put one of the United
States' more reliable Russian allies, President Boris Yeltsin, in
an exquisite political vise. Yeltsin surely faces another economic
disaster if he cannot win another multibillion-dollar loan this
spring from the Western-run International Monetary Fund. But he
also faces possible impeachment this week by his
communist-controlled legislature, which has stationed itself at the
head of the anti-American charge.
</P>
<P>
   And so Yeltsin has juggled the two sides all month, suggesting
to the Communists last week that he favors political union with
Yugoslavia while playing the notion down elsewhere _ and rumbling
publicly about aiming nuclear missiles at Washington while
privately considering nothing of the kind.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's government has sounded so tough toward Washington,
joked Valentin V. Chikin, editor of the reliably Communist
newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya, that both the defense and foreign
ministers sounded like clones of Communist Party leaders in the
national legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's anti-American angst over Yugoslavia may understandably
puzzle Americans. Yugoslavia, after all, shares no border with
Russia and was not even a reliably pro-Moscow ally during the days
of Soviet empire. Its president, Slobodan Milosevic, is hardly the
sort of leader most governments would willingly endorse, much less
risk a global crisis over.
</P>
<P>
   But Russians view the bombing of Yugoslavia through a different
and darker lens. To most of them, the NATO bombing campaign is the
latest and most flagrant instance in which the United States has
ignored Russian wishes, gone back on its word, rubbed Moscow's nose
in its new second-tier status _ or all three.
</P>
<P>
   Rightly or not, Russian illusions about democracy and the
American character have already been shattered by Russia's
disastrous introduction to capitalism, said Sergei M. Rogov, who
directs the Institute for the Study of the U.S. and Canada here.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians were led to believe that the United States would
spend billions of dollars, Marshall Plan-style, to ease Russia's
transition from Communism to market capitalism, he said. When the
money failed to arrive and the transition foundered, the Russian
reaction was to feel betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outcome,'' he said, ``created the perception that the
United States was doing it on purpose _ trying to undermine Russia
as an economic and political competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   American military policy has only reinforced the average
Russian's suspicions, Rogov said. ``Russians felt that we ended the
Cold War and started to behave nicely by dissolving the Warsaw
Pact, withdrawing troops, cutting arms. And thus the very
maintenance of NATO was seen as strange,'' he said. ``But the
enlargement of NATO, with NATO absorbing former Soviet clients _
that was interpreted as a symbol of western mistrust toward Russia,
and some even said hostile intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO intervention in Yugoslavia, in addition to the American and
British bombing of Iraq, has only galvanized Russian fears that the
Soviet propagandists may have been right _ and that Americans are
in fact bent on imposing their will on the world, by force if
necessary.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Unsavory as Milosevic seems to Americans, Rogov added, he is not
that much more brutal than Communist apparatchiks who have seized
power in other post-Soviet states and proceeded to evict ethnic
minorities. The difference, to Westerners, is that he threatens
European stability.
</P>
<P>
   That new view of the United States as a hero with clay feet _ an
evil empire, just like the Soviet one that collapsed in 1991 _ is
hardly dominant now, but it has just as clearly picked up
adherents.
</P>
<P>
   The weight of such disillusionment might be more bearable were
the United States' relationship with Russia strong. But in the view
of some Russian experts, anti-American antagonism is simply filling
an existing diplomatic and political vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   Rogov said the two nations' relations are in deep crisis, with
deep disagreements over everything from economics to military and
strategic policies. Vyachaslav Nikonov, who directs the Russian
research institute Politica, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it can influence the relationship between the
two countries, because the relationship is nonexistent,'' he said.
``Except for IMF issues, I don't think there is an agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever strategic agenda existed, he said, mostly withered
after the United States expanded NATO, began an air war against
Yugoslavia and proposed to abandon the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty, a keystone of Russian security policy.
</P>
<P>
   The average Russian reacts more viscerally to events in
Yugoslavia. Some _ perhaps most _ see the NATO campaign as
satisfying reassurance that Americans, even tough they have lorded
it over the Russians, are no more civilized.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same as what Russia did when we wanted to have
Chechnya,'' said a beefy, 39-year-old unemployed driver who would
identify himself only as Igor, as he stood in Moscow's Pushkin
Square on Friday. ``Now Yugoslavia, next us; that's what I think.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never wanted to help us, not sincerely. Politicians are
never sincere. They just say nice things. Watch what they do.''
With that, he wheeled about and followed the throng into a Pushkin
Square cinema to catch the Moscow premiere of a new motion picture:
the Hollywood science-fiction potboiler, ``Lost in Space.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Since the Feb. 4 killing of her son Amadou in a
barrage of 41 police bullets, Kadiadou Diallo has made a journey
that has taken her further than the 4,300 miles from her home in
the West African nation of Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   A graceful and disarmingly slight woman, she has gone from
paralyzed public grief to telegenic celebrity. The bereaved mother
who collapsed not long ago on the gritty pavement at the scene of
the Bronx shooting has proved to be an engaging public presence who
blossoms in front of a microphone. A virtual stranger, she sails
serenely through New York City's choppy political waters.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Diallo is not the first grief-stricken relative to be
propelled into the public eye _ and into the embrace of
politicians, would-be candidates and high-profile lawyers _ by the
violent death of a loved one.
</P>
<P>
   But she has proved to be the most adept in recent memory at
translating a personal loss into more universal terms, demanding
answers and accountability for the death of her son while avoiding
the pitfalls of racially divisive rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really is a star,'' said Ken Sunshine, a political
consultant working with a coalition of political, business and
labor groups that came together in the wake of the Diallo shooting
to criticize the Police Department and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knew,'' added Sunshine, ``that the mother was so
media-attractive and articulate?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Diallo, who spent six days in the city in early February
and returned only on March 31 for a second visit, shrugs off the
notion that she is a figurehead at the prow of a nascent national
movement focusing on the mistreatment of blacks and other minority
groups by the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a symbol; Amadou is the symbol,'' the 39-year-old
businesswoman said last week, as she shuttled from one public
appearance to another in the black limousine that the Rev. Al
Sharpton and his Harlem-based National Action Network put at her
disposal.
</P>
<P>
   But her new friends in New York City would have it otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, who has acted as adviser, scheduler and companion to
the Diallo family from the start, said he planned to take Mrs.
Diallo on the road to as many as 16 cities as his rallying point
for a national protest against police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, they made their first foray outside New York City
to test Mrs. Diallo's potential as a national icon, appearing with
the Rev. Jesse Jackson at the weekly meeting of his Operation
PUSH/Rainbow Coalition in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Diallo, who sat solemnly with other family members through
several standing ovations, was the main attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Diallo case is the caboose of a long train of abuses,''
Jackson said, and Mrs. Diallo, he added, can serve ``to mobilize a
national consciousness'' about police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Diallo responded that she was simply a mother who had lost
her son. ``I don't care if you call it politics,'' she said. ``I
have to cry out.''
</P>
<P>
   A grieving mother will no doubt evoke general sympathy around
the country, and Mrs. Diallo may even come to be a recognizable
symbol in other cities of black grievances against police officers.
But her iconic status may also prove to be a purely New York City
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way Mrs. Diallo has framed her son's death, putting it
into the context of the historic struggle for justice of black
people in America, has a very deep emotional appeal in a city with
lots of African-Americans and people of African and Caribbean
descent,'' said J. Phillip Thompson, a political science professor
at Columbia University. ``Here you have a woman who symbolizes the
motherland.''
</P>
<P>
   But another large source of her appeal is entirely local. Mrs.
Diallo is admired because she is perceived to have stood up to the
mayor ``at a time when many people in the African-American
community feel like their own leaders have not stood up,'' Thompson
added.
</P>
<P>
   Others in New York have stood up to the city in the aftermath of
a personal tragedy: Iris Baez, whose son, Anthony, died in a
confrontation with the police in the Bronx in 1994, and Cedric
Sandiford, who survived a brutal racial attack in Howard Beach,
Queens, in 1986. But as prominent as they became in a brief
political season, none evoked such broad-ranged sympathy as Mrs.
Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   The intense public spotlight on Mrs. Diallo has revealed a
determined woman who can toss off a sound-bite _ ``Amadou's blood
will feed the battle for justice,'' is one she delivered recently _
and also hold her own as an inspirational speaker in front of a
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need people to come more and more, without any difference
of races and religions, because we need each other to have
strength,'' she said last week before a mostly black audience in
midtown Manhattan. ``We know what is happening is not right, but
they have the power. But God has his own power. We don't want any
violence. We need to go with dignity and pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Diallo said she had not been coached by anyone and uttered
whatever came to her mind at the time of an interview or public
address. Sharpton, she added, simply shows her the schedule of
appearances he has arranged and tells her to ``think what you want
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said it was her decision alone, and not Sharpton's, to
refuse the city's initial offer of financial support and to refuse
to meet Giuliani, who has since complained that people around Mrs.
Diallo blocked such a meeting ``for cynical political reasons.''

CONFLICTS NOT STRETCHING MILITARY TO BREAKING POINT _ YET

<TEXT>
<P>
   In this age of America as superpower without peer, the American
military insists it must possess the might to win two full-scale
wars at once.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for anything less, Defense Secretary William Cohen
stated in a 1997 report, invites ``opportunism (where) an aggressor
in one region might be tempted to take advantage when U.S. forces
are heavily committed elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   And although the attacks in Yugoslavia and Iraq do not yet meet
the Pentagon's idea of a major war, every sortie flown and each
missile launched pushes America's military closer to its limits.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, flights bringing relief supplies to Kosovar refugees
or whisking those exiles out of the region further tax American
military wherewithal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're starting to see things stretched pretty thin,'' said
Harold Rood, a professor of international strategic studies at
Claremont McKenna College near Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The danger, experts say, is not that the United States is too
weak to _ if pressed _ pummel the Yugoslav army. Serbia, after all,
is smaller in size, population and wealth than Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, analysts see a small but growing risk that U.S. forces
could find themselves shorthanded if trouble cropped up elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The American missions over the Balkans and Middle East occur
against a backdrop of significant budget cuts. Since the
dissolution of the Soviet Union, the number of fighter aircraft had
been cut by a third.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made ourselves vulnerable across the board,'' said
retired Army Col. Harry Summers, a fellow at the U.S. Army War
College and conservative newspaper columnist.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we suddenly have a flareup in North Korea, we'll have a
hard time mustering the forces we need there.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, military leaders say they have enough firepower to
attack the armies of Slobodan Milosevic and Saddam Hussein while
guarding against even more serious challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. aircraft in theater is nothing near the total aircraft or
military capability we have today,'' said Air Force Maj. Gen.
Charles Wald. ``We still have a significant amount of forces and
reserve.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO commanders have asked for even more than the 600 or so
aircraft now flying over Yugoslavia. The Pentagon, which has
committed about 275 Air Force planes, is dispatching 13 more
stealth fighters, five more B-1 bombers and 24 tank-killing Apache
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many billion-dollar chess pieces, aircraft carriers are
being shifted from one sea to the next so American commanders can
keep forces poised on active, and potential, battlefronts.
</P>
<P>
   The Kitty Hawk is steaming from off the coast of northeast Asia
to the Persian Gulf. The Theodore Roosevelt, in turn, has left the
gulf to lend its 75 aircraft to the Kosovo buildup.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the 48 KC-135 tanker planes from McConnell Air
Force Base near Wichita have taken part in Operation Allied Storm,
including the in-air refueling of the first combat flights of B-2
stealth bombers out of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the number of military flights ranges from two to three
times as much as in peacetime. But, said Maj. Steve Christy at
Scott Air Force Base in southern Illinois, the military is geared
for such fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the pattern that we have some times that are
busier than others,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The humanitarian demands of supplying or evacuating Kosovar
refugees also have meant fewer transports available to shift the
Apache helicopters from Germany to Albania, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Air Force is fast running out of its air-launched
cruise missiles _ reserves have fallen below 100 _ and no assembly
line is in place to crank out replacements.
</P>
<P>
   After NATO joined the fight over Kosovo, American patrols
enforcing no-fly zones over Iraq dropped off. Soon F-15 and F-16
fighter jets and three electronic warfare aircraft were moved from
bases in Turkey to positions in Italy, according to The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   Such shortages prompt some critics to suggest that the United
States more selectively entangle itself in military missions _ or
start asking taxpayers to pay for a larger war machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to have this standoff kind of war, you better
supply the sort of weapons needed to do it,'' said Elaine Donnelly,
president of the conservative Center for Military Readiness.
``Right now, we're not doing enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the crumbling of the Soviet Union, no military has rivaled
the United States. It boasts more than 4,000 aircraft, with more on
the drawing boards. No other country has an aircraft carrier as
large as the smallest of America's fleet of 12. The defense budget
consumes more than $260 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Even with that, military mechanics have begun to cannibalize
aging aircraft for spare parts. Because crews need time for
training and leave, the Navy can rarely count on deploying even
half its carrier force at once. And although America increasingly
patrols the world, it accounts for only about 30 percent of the
planet's military spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not hard to get overstretched when all your enemies are
on the other side of the world,'' said Loren Thompson, a defense
analyst with the Lexington Institute. ``I know that's making a vice
out of a virtue, but it's still an efficiency problem.''
</P>
<P>
   That means that instead of launching air attacks from home bases
_ the B-2 bombers that fly from Whiteman Air Force Base mark a
small and rare exception _ the United States must send aircraft
carriers to hot spots or count on allies to share their airstrips.
The latter alternative has proved more troublesome lately as Turkey
and Saudi Arabia have balked at air strikes launched from their
soil.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said most scenarios call for some long-term presence of
American forces in Kosovo once the fighting stops, meaning fewer
military resources to patrol the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   He argues that the lingering effects of entanglements elsewhere
are responsible for shortages in the Balkans now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still bombing Iraq eight years after Desert Storm. We're
still in Korea 40 years after that war,'' Thompson said. ``The
problem is we don't get wars over quickly anymore.''

 NEW YORK: political reasons.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I'm a woman, a mother, and I understand who he is,'' she said.
``I saw him on TV when I got here and he said the cops were good
cops. So with or without Reverend Al, I would say to the mayor the
same thing. He could not get to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Diallo was thrust into the public eye five days after her
son, who was unarmed, was killed in the entranceway to his Bronx
apartment building. That day, her first in the city, she traveled
in a police van to the building and, in a searing scene captured by
television cameras, she crumpled to the ground, wailing ``Amadou,
Amadou.''
</P>
<P>
   Limp and weeping, she was half-carried through the bullet-pocked
doorway and out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   When she emerged 45 minutes later, her first words established
the themes for many of her later statements. She said forcefully
that her son came from ``a good family.'' Then she added, ``Justice
must be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, more than two months after the killing, Mrs. Diallo
and other relatives stress at every opportunity that theirs is a
family of means and education that counts itself a part of the
Guinean elite. The country's foreign minister is a close friend, as
are other officials. In one of the poorest countries of the world,
they have all the modern conveniences at home: satellite
television, fax machines, e-mail and cellular telephones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the way they first talked about Amadou, like he
is from a poor background,'' Mrs. Diallo complained in a recent
conversation. ``I want to correct this idea about our family. We
are educated.''
</P>
<P>
   She is the third of nine children of a Guinean civil servant and
his wife, who wanted all their children to get a university
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew up with many Western ways,'' said Bobo Diallo, the
next-youngest after Mrs. Diallo. ``But our father raised us with
the idea that money is just something you use. You don't do just
anything for money.''
</P>
<P>
   Kadiadou Diallo, however, did not finish her schooling. She
married Saikou Amad Diallo at the age of 14. She was his second
wife. Her father set one strict condition for the marriage: Her new
husband had to send her to high school. When the couple moved to
Liberia, she attended a private school for several years where she
learned English.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Diallo had four children _ Amadou was her eldest _ and
accompanied her husband to Singapore and Bangkok, Thailand, where
they ran a business importing gemstones from Africa. When they
divorced, in 1994, she remained for a time in Thailand, so her
children could continue studying in an international school where
classes were conducted in French and English.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Diallo returned to Guinea two years ago, remarried last
fall and now is trying to set up a joint venture with an Australian
investor in the mining sector. (Her father and both her husbands
are named Diallo, but none are closely related.)
</P>
<P>
   Her former husband, who lives in Vietnam, has also been making
speeches and giving interviews in New York City but, without his
former wife's command of English and her ease in front of a
microphone, he has not matched her star status.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the interest in the photogenic Mrs. Diallo follows
a well-worn pattern in New York City. Politicians _ both in and out
of office, for purposes of self-interest and for loftier professed
goals _ have always embraced the grieving relatives of crime
victims or victims of police violence.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   It is rare that the relatives move beyond the embrace and become
players on their own. But it has happened.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Rosenbaum, whose brother, Yankel, was killed in
disturbances in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn in 1991,
shuttled back and forth for years between his home in Australia and
New York City for the various trials and legal proceedings related
to the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Like Mrs. Diallo, he started as a stranger to the city's
fractious political culture, but became a celebrity of sorts,
appearing on television shows and at public meetings. But
Rosenbaum, embraced by Orthodox Jewish groups in much the same way
that Mrs. Diallo has been embraced by Sharpton's organization,
plunged into the city's political wars.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum stridently attacked the mayor at the time, David
Dinkins, campaigned for Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in his tight
re-election battle and openly endorsed Giuliani, who was Dinkins'
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Diallo said she would not allow herself to be used in local
political contests. But the fact remains that Giuliani is likely to
run for the U.S. Senate next year and his response to the Diallo
shooting will be an issue, political veterans said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not naive, so she's got to understand she's already
become a player in an as-yet undeclared Senate race,'' said a
former city official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
``I've got to believe she's accepted that role.''

BILLS WOULD LIMIT LAWSUITS OVER Y2K BUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FINN BULLERS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Customers stacked up 20 deep in 1995 on the opening day of a
gourmet grocery in Warren, Mich., before finally walking out in a
huff.
</P>
<P>
   The swipe of a single credit card with a year 2000 expiration
date had crashed the Produce Palace's computer register, which was
high-tech but not Y2K-compliant.
</P>
<P>
   That made owner Mike Yarsike an early victim of the Y2K bug. He
settled for $260,000 from the cash register company after becoming
one of the first victims to file a Y2K lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But few others will have that option if some federal and state
lawmakers have their way.
</P>
<P>
   Laws proposed in Congress and 30 states, including Missouri and
Kansas, would limit the ability of consumers to sue over Y2K
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers fear Y2K problems could trip a landslide of lawsuits
costing as much as $3 trillion. In fact, by the end of this year
and the first quarter of next year, Y2K lawyers' fees could soar
three times as high as the cost of fixing the computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   Since March, more than 80 lawsuits have been filed and almost
800 are in the prefiling stage, said Lou Marcoccio, director of
research for the GartnerGroup of Stamford, Conn. Many of those are
class-action cases aimed at high-tech companies that, plaintiffs
contend, knew about the glitch but sold faulty software anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But small businesses also have been sued for anything from a
failure to supply parts to a customer to misrepresentation of their
year 2000 readiness.
</P>
<P>
   With so much money up for grabs, business owners hope lawmakers
can give them some common-sense protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses fear they are going to do everything they can to be
Y2K-compliant and yet they are going to be sucked into a litigation
black hole,'' said Dave Clark, a Y2K lawyer with Lathrop &AMP; Gage in
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses want to be able to ``concentrate their resources on
fixing the Y2K problem and not get diverted by the litigation
explosion,'' said Jim Wooten, head of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce's Institute of Legal Reform.
</P>
<P>
   But many trial lawyers and consumer groups strongly oppose legal
protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the fear of being sued that forces people to do what
needs to be done,'' said James Love, director of Ralph Nader's
Consumer Project on Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mandell, president of the Association of Trial Lawyers of
America, sees any immunity as corporate favoritism.
</P>
<P>
   Grocer Yarsike pointed out that businesses that experience Y2K
problems need some recourse. If liability laws had been in place
when he had his troubles, Yarsike said, he would be bankrupt today.
</P>
<P>
   The limited-immunity proposals in Congress are being pushed
aggressively by the Information Technology Association of America,
which represents such firms as IBM, Microsoft Corp. and AT&AMP;T Corp.
</P>
<P>
   One bill approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee last month
would create a 90-day grace period for companies to fix computer
problems. It would encourage alternatives to lawsuits, limit
class-action cases and provide immunity to companies making
``reasonable'' efforts to solve their computer bugs.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, introduced by Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican,
and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, also would cap
punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is expected to reach the floor of the Senate soon,
where it may face opposition from the Clinton administration and
many Democrats who have expressed concern about curbing the right
to sue for damages.
</P>
<P>
   None of the proposed legislation would block lawsuits completely
or provide immunity in personal-injury cases.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, Kansas and Missouri legislators have joined 28
other states and the District of Columbia in crafting Y2K immunity
legislation, although it is not moving as quickly as in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas House Bill 2185, introduced by Rep. Kenny Wilk, a Lansing
Republican, would allow a 60-day grace period for companies. It
also excludes class-action suits and limits Y2K awards to actual
damages.
</P>
<P>
   But that bill and House Bill 2281, introduced by Rep. Michael
O'Neal, a Hutchinson Republican, have little support so far.
O'Neal's bill helps protect the state and its employees from being
sued because of computer glitches.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers think state law may already provide enough
protection. Dan Stanley, secretary of the Department of
Administration, isn't sure and has asked Attorney General Carla
Stovall to review the matter.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, Senate Bill 482 protects small businesses with
fewer than 50 employees from class-action suits and provides
protections similar to those in proposed federal legislation.
Pushed by the Missouri Chamber of Commerce, the bill has received
little support, said its sponsor, Sen. Francis Flotron, a
Chesterfield Republican.
</P>
<P>
   House Bill 978 protects the state from lawsuits, but Attorney
General Jay Nixon already has ruled the state is protected under
existing law. The bill is not on the calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas and Missouri sponsors of some of the languishing bills
aren't too concerned _ federal legislation would offer adequate
immunity, they say.

 &HT;    Tech graduate plays role in Duval's slip
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jack Carswell was minding his business, reveling in
David Duval's third birdie in four holes and walking to the right
of the 11th fairway when he got up close and personal with the 63rd
Masters. Duval's errant drive flew right and bounced once into the
gallery _ and smack into Carswell's back.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Carswell, Georgia Tech class of '66, meet David Duval,
four-time Tech All-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have known what it was if everybody wasn't yelling,
`Fore!''' said Carswell, an Augustan who wore a 1990 Georgia Tech
national football championship hat. ``I'd have thought somebody
bumped me. I just covered my head and felt it hit me in the back.
No big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for Carswell, perhaps, but definitely for Duval. When
Duval's second shot was blown left by the wind, it bounced into the
water alongside the green. That led to a double-bogey 6 and
triggered Duval's erratic back nine that cost him any shot at the
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry now that I stopped it,'' Carswell said after
watching Duval go into the water. ``The ball might've rolled a
little farther. Might not be in the water.'' Get back, Jack. Not
your fault.
</P>
<P>
   Tough day for Woods
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, who opened the day in the mix at 2 under, took
himself out of contention early with a bogey on the first hole and
a double-bogey on the par-4 No. 5 en route to a front-nine score of
40. And this from the 1997 champion who spoke Saturday of shooting
in the low 30s to put pressure on the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   First Woods' putting failed him, then the rest of his game
followed. He battled to make pars. On No. 8 _ where he took an 8 in
Thursday's opening round when he hit into the bushes on the left of
the fairway _ Woods hit his tee shot into the bushes and trees on
the right. Like Thursday, his second shot hit a tree _ actually,
two trees _ and caromed about 20 feet to the right.
</P>
<P>
   He blasted out across the fairway, behind the mounds that tower
over the left of the left side of the green. He missed a par putt
and dropped to his knees. He made a bogey on the hole to drop to 1
over. Finally, he closed the front with his fourth bogey in nine
holes as his putting continued to be erratic.
</P>
<P>
   About those greens
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated with his inability to manage an under-par round for
the first time in his past 12 rounds at Augusta National, Atlanta's
Billy Andrade left the course Sunday calling several greens ``a
joke.''
</P>
<P>
   While Andrade spoke after a 75 for a 7-over 295, Jeff Sluman
walked by and reaffirmed the tricked-up theme, saying, ``Anybody
seen Mickey Mouse?''
</P>
<P>
   After regrouping from a start in which he bogeyed three of his
first five holes Thursday, Andrade played solidly until bogeys at
the 17th and 18th Sunday. Combining gusting wind and rock-hard
greens, Andrade said conditions were ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrade said ``17 is a joke if you don't hit it in the left
rough off the tee. ... I don't mind greens playing tough, but when
you can't stop a 9-iron or a wedge, what's the point?''
</P>
<P>
   Among the amateurs
</P>
<P>
   Matt Kuchar's queasy Masters ended with a disappointing 78,
eliminating any chance of keeping his title of low amateur.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar began the day one shot behind playing partner Tom
McKnight and one up on Spaniard Sergio Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, who shot 73 to finish at 7-over 295, won the sterling
silver cup given to the low amateur. McKnight finished at 9-over
297, Kuchar at 11-over 299. The other amateur who made the cut,
South African Trevor Immelmman, was at 17-over 305.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough coming in here feeling so poorly. It was unlucky,
but I just tried to go on from there,'' said Kuchar, who has had
flu-like symptoms for better than a week. ``Today really showed
that I haven't been practicing. My game's not in proper
condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar's undoing was a triple-bogey 8 on No. 13 (drive in the
pine straw, lay up, water, chip long, three putts).
</P>
<P>
   Next, Kuchar said, is about three weeks worth of makeup work at
Georgia Tech. Then he has to figure some way to qualify for next
year's Masters. ``Plan A is to do well in the U.S. Open (top 16
qualify for the next Masters). Plan B is to win the U.S. Amateur
(the runner-up also makes it).''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, the British amateur champion, became the first European
to gain the low-amateur honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it makes Spain proud,'' said Garcia, whose round
included four birdies. ``And I played a good round in the most
difficult of our four days here. It's exciting to know I'm the
first from Europe to win low amateur at the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot in my first Masters. I learned you have to
have a lot of patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc. ...
</P>
<P>
   Having clinched the low-amateur finish, Garcia appeared on the
practice putting green to wish fellow Spaniard Jose Maria Olazabal
good luck. ... Tom Lehman closed with a 75 and called the course
``harder by far than TPC (Sawgrass). This course is a lot scarier.
We've never played Augusta before where you've had to bounce over
the ledges.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The war in Kosovo is producing images of destruction that have
lent special intensity to the conflict's ethnic and religious
dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the various religious groups touched by the war have
read these images _ villages burned to the ground, women and
children driven from homes, crowds herded on to train wagons _
nearly as texts bearing messages, and are interpreting them
according to their particular history.
</P>
<P>
   The images may be familiar but their readings are rarely the
same, and for many contain riveting symbolism. They are either
about the experiences of World War II, or the centuries of tension
between Islam and the West, or even the long rift between the
Western and Eastern branches of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the hundreds of thousands of people routed from their
homes and forced to flee, often packed into train cars, have
created scenes that recall the Nazi attacks on European Jews half a
century ago.
</P>
<P>
   For others, especially Serbs and those who feel a kinship with
them, the NATO air strikes Sunday during the Orthodox Christian
Easter call forth memories of the assault by German warplanes on
Belgrade on Easter in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   For still others, there is another way to look at the war, too,
in the question raised by some U.S. Muslims about how committed the
West will be to defending a largely Islamic minority, the Kosovar
Albanians, in the heart of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cuts to the core of the issue of how Islam and the West are
going to be compatible,'' Salam Al-Marayati, director of the Muslim
Public Affairs Council, said in a telephone interview from the
council's offices in Los Angeles. He described the Yugoslav army's
drive against the Kosovar Albanians as ``genocide,'' and said that
if it succeeded, ``then the future is very bleak for Muslims in the
West and for pluralism in general.''
</P>
<P>
   Helal Ahmed, who attended a small rally Sunday in Washington in
support of the bombing, said, ``I think what is happening in Kosovo
is the same as what happened to the Jews under Hitler.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, during Easter celebrations at Holy Resurrection
Cathedral in Chicago, a center of the Serbian Orthodox Church in
the United States and Canada, worshipers were read a letter from
Patriarch Pavle, in Belgrade, who called the NATO bombing
``inhuman.''
</P>
<P>
   Marko Bojovich, who heads the cathedral's youth group, said
people at the service ``feel betrayed, especially because a lot of
us religious leaders called for a cease-fire.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those attending, Bob Kornic, 57, an engineer from
Shelbyville, Mich., noted the profound importance many Serbs attach
to Kosovo, where a Serbian army was overwhelmed by invading Turkish
forces in 1389. ``It would be easier for the Jewish people to
concede Jerusalem than for Serbia to concede Kosovo,'' he said.
``That's our Holy Land.''
</P>
<P>
   Mick Spaic, 48, an engineer from Schaumburg, Ill., said he was
born into a Serbian family in the city of Pec, in Kosovo, in 1951.
``At that time, it was 50 percent Christian Serbs and 50 percent
Albanians,'' he said. ``When I was a little kid, 6 years old, I
could have taken a half-mile short-cut through the Albanian
neighborhood. I got beaten or chased so many times. Now you're
portraying the Serbians as bad boys and the Albanians as good
boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent pleas for humanitarian aid for the Kosovar Albanians
included a full-page advertisement in The New York Times last week
by the American Jewish World Service and the International Rescue
Committee. It included a photograph of refugees crowding aboard a
train, an image of people despised and dispossessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The images are very, very powerful,'' said Rabbi A. James
Rudin, interreligious affairs director at the American Jewish
Committee. Among some Jews, reacting to the refugees' plight, Rudin
said, ``I've heard the phrase, `They are us.' ''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The war, too, has called attention to an old division within
Christianity, between the Western churches and their Eastern
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite many important efforts by leaders of both branches to
heal a breach dating to 1054 (when Pope Leo IX and Patriarch
Michael Cerularius of Constantinople declared each other anathema),
tensions between West and East have flared since the fall of
Communism over Western missionaries' proselytizing in historically
Orthodox nations.
</P>
<P>
   And since the war over Kosovo began, expressions of sympathy
with the Serbs have been evident in Russia and Greece. During
Easter services in Greece Sunday, The Associated Press reported,
anti-war protesters were evident and donations for the Serbs were
collected.
</P>
<P>
   From the start of the NATO campaign, tensions have also been
felt within the World Council of Churches, which represents nearly
340 Protestant and Orthodox denominations. Without attempting to
assign blame, the council has called for a cease-fire and a
negotiated peace.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, the council's general-secretary, the Rev.
Konrad Raiser, said the NATO bombing had aggravated tensions
between Orthodox and non-Orthodox, although how much it would do so
was a matter of speculation. But, he said, ``From an Orthodox
perspective, it is at least conspicuous that the main powers
involved in the NATO action are, of course, powers shaped by a
predominately Protestant ethos.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all political conflicts, whether acknowledged or not, there
is a religious undercurrent,'' Raiser added, ``because even in our
secularized world, the neat separation of religion and politics
doesn't work any more.''

 &HT;    Olazabal the new Master
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ On a wild, windy day at Augusta National Golf
Club on Sunday, as contenders regularly blew off the leaderboard
and succombed to rock-hard greens, Jose Maria Olazabal steadied
himself to recapture a dream.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old Spaniard held off a charge from Greg Norman and
Davis Love III for a closing 71, a 72-hole score of 8-under-par 280
and a second green jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago Olazabal couldn't walk without severe pain, let
alone play golf, because of arthritis in his feet and back
problems. Today he's again the Masters champion, and the
satisfaction is deeper than the hole his career once occupied.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was at my lowest, I never thought about this happening
again,'' an emotional Olazabal said. ``I thought I would never play
golf again. To be right here standing in front of you with a green
jacket, it's an achievement that I didn't even dream about.''
</P>
<P>
   While the duel was often Olazabal and Norman, Love, with a 71,
managed to sneak in for second place at 6-under 282 by hanging in
on the back nine. Chipping in from 25 feet at the par-3 16th, Love
matched his runnerup finish to Ben Crenshaw in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   While the 44-year-old Norman, clearly the crowd favorite, again
failed to win, finishing second at the Masters for the fourth time
(5-under 283) on a closing 73, he redeemed himself from the
collapse of 1996. After eagling the 13th and briefly holding the
lead there until Olazabal knocked in a birdie on top of him, Norman
bogeyed 14 and 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a successful week and a sad week all rolled
up in one,'' said Norman, who underwent shoulder surgery last year.
``I feel I'm back in the position where I can contend again, but
obviously, there's the sadness of not winning.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point five-way tie existed for the lead. With greens
unable to hold shots and a gusting wind that made it nearly
impossible to judge ball flight and carry, Olazabal's consistency
was nothing short of masterful. If he halted Norman's momentum at
the 13th, he made his own by birdieing the 16th and then making a
fantastic par at the 17th, pushing his lead to a valuable two shots
on the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to be a tough day, especially when I got
to the clubhouse and saw how hard the wind was blowing,'' Olazabal
said.
</P>
<P>
   After hooking his tee shot at the 17th, Olazabal said if he
could get a par, ``I knew the jacket should be mine.''
</P>
<P>
   David Duval, seeking a 12th win in his last 35 events, was a
Sunday factor, but settled for a tie for sixth after
double-bogeying the 11th hole with a second shot to the water. His
70, one of only seven rounds under par Sunday, was the low score of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods shot a front-nine 40 and disappeared with a 75,
tying for 18th.
</P>
<P>
   Completing the huge day for Spain, 19-year-old Sergio Garcia
finished as low amateur at 7-over 295.

 ALBRIGHT IN BRUSSELS TO BOLSTER UNITY IN By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ On her first visit to NATO since NATO forces
began bombing Yugoslavia on March 24, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright arrived here Sunday night for a gathering of foreign
ministers designed to show unity in the 19-member alliance as it
pursues its air campaign against Slobodan Milosevic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anxious to belie the assertions of Yugoslav leaders that NATO
will soon weary of the air campaign over their nation, officials
said the alliance would meet Monday to reaffirm demands that
include Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, withdraw his troops from
Kosovo and allow the return of ethnic Albanian refugees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Albright insisted that, despite efforts of Milosevic to splinter
NATO, the alliance was ``wedge proof'' and had been galvanized by
his forced expulsions of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanian
refugees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On French television Sunday, the foreign minister, Hubert
Vedrine, said the time had come to consider the shape of a
political settlement for Kosovo and that the Russians must be
involved in the outcome.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have entered a phase where there is a need for preparation,
a reflections, a consultation on what is to follow,'' Vedrine said.
In line with French policy that favors using the United Nations,
Vedrine suggested that the international security force envisioned
to bring refugees back to Kosovo should be drawn up ``within the
framework of the United Nations.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He added that it was essential to have Russia involved in a
political settlement of Kosovo and in the security force.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Previous plans spoke almost exclusively of a NATO force,'' he
said. ``The Russians could perhaps join a force that was fixed,
decided and determined within the framework of the United
Nations.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Officials traveling with Albright said that since Vedrine
stipulated that the political outcome in Kosovo must conform to the
demands laid out by NATO, including the withdrawal of Yugoslav
troops, they did not interpret Vedrine's comments as waywardness.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Albright is scheduled to meet with the Russian foreign minister,
Igor Ivanov, in Oslo Tuesday. The secretary said Russia could play
a ``useful role,'' but she said they still needed to get
``re-engaged.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have remained adamant in their opposition to the
NATO bombing, and under pressure from strong pro-Serbian sentiment
in the Russian parliament, Ivanov has issued almost daily
statements against the alliance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, President Boris Yeltsin of Russia said that if NATO
sent ground troops to Kosovo to ``make it their protectorate, we
cannot allow this.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the Clinton administration would accept a
partition of Kosovo as part of a political settlement, Albright
said it was ``premature'' to talk about such questions. But she
said that the she was not opposed to ``arrangements'' being made
for Serbs to have access to the ``holy places'' that are important
to them.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some officials have postulated that one of the aims of the
forced expulsions of ethnic Albanians was to allow Milosevic to
bargain with the West over keeping the parts of Kosovo that hold
Serbian Orthodox shrines and giving the rest to ethnic Albanians.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the public acknowledgment in the last few days that the air
campaign would continue for at least a number of weeks and perhaps
longer, NATO officials have been monitoring public opinion in
Europe very closely. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because of the atrocities against the ethnic Albanians by &QL; 
Milosevic, public opinion has become increasingly supportive of the
bombing raids, officials said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In France and Britain, public sentiment has surged in favor of
the NATO actions and in France more than 70 percent of the people
say they support the bombing in which their pilots and aircraft are
playing a significant role.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, the public is less enthusiastic, but the German
foreign minister, Joachim Fischer, has taken the strongest stand
against Milosevic of any of the Europeans.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other alliance members were reported to be staying firm although
how long sentiment would hold in Italy and Greece was problematic,
officials said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Greece, traditionally sympathetic to the Serbs, did not ask NATO
for a pause in the bombing campaign in respect of Orthodox Easter.
Albright is scheduled to meet with the Greek foreign minister,
George Papendreau, to urge him to keep with the NATO aerial
campaign.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The meeting at NATO headquarters will be the first to include
the three new members _ Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic _
who joined the alliance last month. Violent street demonstrations
against the air assaults in Prague, the capital of the Czech
Republic, added some nervousness in the Czech government toward the
bombing.

BOSNIAN CROAT LEADER GOES ON TRIAL FOR WAR CRIMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands _ An influential Bosnian Croat
politician, a former ally of the Croatian president, goes on trial
on Monday before the international war crimes tribunal here, a
process that is likely to throw the spotlight on Croatia's role in
the Bosnia conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The politician, Dario Kordic, is accused of a series of war
crimes against Muslims in Bosnia. He was the leader of the Bosnian
wing of the political party of Croatia's president, Franjo Tudjman.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was a key political figure when not only Serbia but
also Croatia instigated violence in Bosnia, prosecutors in The
Hague considered Kordic one of the most wanted war crimes suspects
on the Croatian side of the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   Kordic was charged in 1995 with ordering the expulsion and
killing of scores of Muslim families living in the Lasva Valley of
central Bosnia in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have argued that the expulsions were part of a
strategy to empty the valley of its Muslim inhabitants and give the
party affiliated with Tudjman control over a central part of
Bosnia. They say the ultimate political and military goal was to
annex part of Bosnia to Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   The Kordic trial begins as the trial of another senior Bosnian
Croat, Gen. Tihomir Blaskic, is going on at the tribunal. Blaskic,
who was charged in some of the same incidents as Kordic, gave
himself up to the tribunal in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Kordic surrendered to the tribunal in October 1997 after intense
pressure from American and European governments on Tudjman.
Washington went as far as blocking loans to Croatia from the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   For months after his indictment and until his surrender, Kordic
enjoyed high-level protection and lived in an apartment in Zagreb,
the Croatian capital, which was reportedly owned by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers familiar with trial here see it as significant that even
now Kordic's defense lawyers are being paid for by the Croatian
government. In most cases so far, the tribunal itself pays for
defense counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators and diplomats say Kordic knew a great deal about
the inner workings of the Zagreb government during the Bosnia war.
As part of the inner political inner circle, he could offer
important evidence about the Croatian leaders who were behind
Zagreb's version of ``ethnic cleansing'' in Bosnia, the strategy of
getting rid of Muslim, Serbian and other non-Croatian civilians by
terrorizing them.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats say Tudjman himself is under investigation for his
role in a range of ethnic cleansing incidents during the war that
followed the breakup of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Kordic may also have information about secret meetings that
Tudjman is said to have had with Slobodan Milosevic, at the time
the president of Serbia and now the president of Yugoslavia. At
those meetings, during the Bosnian war, the two leaders are alleged
to have discussed the carving up of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   A military commander, Mario Cerkez, will be tried with Kordic.
Cerkez, 40, a Bosnian Croat, was the local military commander of
the so-called Croatian Defense Council in the town of Vitez and one
of Blaskic's subordinates. He surrendered to the tribunal at the
same time as Kordic.
</P>
<P>
   Cerkez, too, has been charged with war crimes. Both men have
pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The indictment charges that Kordic bears leadership
responsibility for planning and overseeing attacks on Bosnian
Muslims from 1991 to 1994. It says that Cerkez, as commander of the
Vitez brigade, ``was directly and actively involved in the
wide-scale persecution of Bosnian Muslim civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment places Kordic at the forefront of the strategy to
drive out non-Croats and join part of Bosnia to Croatia. It says he
signed orders and documents and ``exercised power, command and
authority in, over and through the Croatian Defense Council.''
</P>
<P>
   After the defense council was set up in 1992, Kordic became its
vice president, acting as the chief executive and defense authority
in an area that called itself the Croatian Republic of
Herceg-Bosna, though it was never recognized by the international
community.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment says that as ``part of the highest circle of
political and military leaders,'' Kordic made policy and strategic
decisions, negotiated or countermanded cease-fire agreements,
issued military orders, dressed in military attire and decided if
relief convoys or U.N. vehicles could pass through checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Cerkez, a former car mechanic and factory worker, became
commander of the Bosnian Croat brigade of Vitez in 1992. He is held
responsible for a series of crimes carried out by his subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, both men hold direct responsibility
in the terror campaign in which Muslim civilians in towns or
neighborhoods ``with no military significance'' were driven from
their homes, often at night, and their houses and mosques were
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Many were imprisoned in squalid detention camps where they were
beaten, sexually assaulted and wounded. A former prison commander,
Zlatko Aleksovski, is standing trial separately at the tribunal in
connection with Lasva Valley crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment of Kordic and Cerkez cites more than a dozen
towns and villages of the Lasva Valley where Muslim neighborhoods
were terrorized.
</P>
<P>
   But the most notorious assault happened in Ahmici in 1993.
Members of a British contingent of U.N. peacekeepers have told the
tribunal that more than 100 Muslims, including women, children and
old people were killed in Ahmici, some burned in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, the Croatian campaign against the
Muslim population of central Bosnia took place on such a large
scale that by 1994 the Bosnian Muslim population ''was
substantially reduced and relocated.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial opening Monday will be the eighth trial going on at
the U.N. criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. It has 26
people in detention.

 U.S. STRATEGISTS OPENLY DISCUSS ISSUE OF G.I.s ON YUGOSLAV SOIL  
(See also: KOSOVO-RDP, KOSOVO-ALBANIA, KOSOVO-ALBRIGHT,(js) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and
senior administration officials talked more openly Sunday about the
possibility that U.S. ground troops would be sent into Kosovo, but
insisted again that President Clinton had no intention for now of
sending soldiers to do battle there.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials also strongly suggested that Yugoslavia
would have to oust President Slobodan Milosevic for the nation to
have any hope of restoring normal relations with its European
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, said that NATO planners
estimated last year that as many as 200,000 soldiers from the
United States and other NATO members would be needed for a ground
war, and that they might have to invade Serb-dominated areas of
Yugoslavia north of Kosovo, the southern province in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't excluded using more than one point of entry or
numerous points of entry,'' he said on the ABC News program ``This
Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelton nodded his head when asked if NATO would consider
entering Kosovo from the north _ after a NATO invasion of other,
more northern regions of Serbia, the major entity in Yugoslavia.
``If in fact that was required,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton and the senior administration officials making the
rounds of the Sunday television talk shows appeared eager to do
what they have not done in the past _ leave open the possibility
that ground troops would be needed to finish a war that has so far
proved unwinnable from the air.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on the NBC News program ``Meet the Press,'' John
Podesta, Clinton's chief of staff, said that ``the president does
not have the intention to use ground troops'' but that ``those
plans and assessments could be updated quickly if we decide to do
that _ need to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The new willingness to discuss the possibility of using ground
troops was in part a response to criticism from Congress, where
prominent lawmakers from both parties have called on the
administration to prepare detailed plans for use of a ground force
in Kosovo. Clinton is scheduled to meet with congressional leaders
on Monday to discuss the U.S.-led military campaign against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on ``Meet the Press,'' Sen. Joseph R. Biden of
Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, said, ``I don't think we should have ever taken ground
troops off the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, Republican of Arizona and member of the Armed
Services Committee, said on ``Fox News Sunday'' that he was urging
Senate leaders to prepare a resolution that ``authorizes the
president to use all means necessary in order to achieve the stated
goals,'' including ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. George A. Joulwan, who retired in 1997 as NATO's military
commander, suggested on the same program that NATO ground troops
might even be needed to march on Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, in
order ``to stop this terrible unacceptable behavior by Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Clinton administration officials questioned whether the
United States could ever again negotiate with Milosevic after the
reports of mass killings, rapes and other atrocities by Serbian
forces in Kosovo.

   DENVER _ A large portion of the air traffic control system
appeared to function smoothly early Sunday as the clocks in radar
centers around Colorado rolled over from Dec. 31, 1999, to Jan. 1,
2000, in a dress rehearsal for New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy New Year! It worked!'' proclaimed Jane Garvey, the
administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, at a news
conference at the Denver Terminal Radar Approach Control, just
outside Denver International Airport, at 1:30 a.m. Sunday. The
conference followed the three-hour drill observed by aviation
executives and two hours of briefings for them.
</P>
<P>
   The test was designed to ensure that the system's computers
could handle the so-called Year 2000 problem, the breakdowns that
could arise because some computers cannot recognize that the
two-digit date ``00'' means 2000. Some computer experts and
aviation officials have warned against flying on Jan. 1, out of
concern that air traffic systems around the world would be
unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garvey said the test showed that the system ``worked as it
should, smoothly, efficiently and safely.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the rollover was blissfully boring. While all airline
flights in the region were handled by the usual computer system
running the real date, a backup system, advanced to New Year's Eve,
shadowed each move to assure that it could track everything in
flight and perform all other critical functions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, an FAA plane was under the guidance of an air
traffic controller whose radios and radar screens were controlled
by the system that rolled over to 2000. It took a determined effort
by that pilot and controller to wring any measure of drama from
their exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Convair three-niner,'' called the air traffic controller to
the pilot, who was heading for the Denver airport. ``Denver
Approach,'' she identified herself. ``Time is one minute prior to
entering the new millennium in our test system. How do you read
this transmission?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Loud and clear,'' said the pilot, ``and if we disappear off
the screen, it means we went into the next millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger, three-niner,'' replied the controller, a laugh in her
voice, but, as she and the pilot suspected, the plane did not
disappear from the controller's radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, a twin-engine propeller model, proceeded uneventfully
toward Runway 16, just as the blip proceeded uneventfully across
the controller's radar screen. Seconds later, after the rollover of
dozens of clocks, including one in the computer that controls the
radio frequencies, the controller asked the pilot again if he had
heard her transmission. ``It went right through the sound barrier
very nicely,'' he assured her.
</P>
<P>
   The agency will take several days to study the data, but on
first blush, the test seemed to meet the goal set by Ray Long, who
directs the agency's Year 2000 preparedness program.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were fairly confident, having run most of the major
elements of the test on four occasions in the last few months.
These tests followed what they described as an exhaustive
examination of their computer systems, which include software
written by generations of programmers long gone, some of it in
computer languages now mostly forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   On the real New Year's Eve, Ms. Garvey and Long plan to leave a
Washington airport in the afternoon, on a westbound commercial
flight, and to be aloft at midnight Greenwich Mean Time, the
standard that air traffic control computers use around the United
States. They plan to choose a flight that will land at a major
airport somewhere in mid-continent, and have a news conference,
late in the evening of Dec. 31, local time, and then to board
another flight for California, which will have them aloft at
midnight local time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It truly happens at midnight Universal Coordinated Time,''
Long said, using an aviation term for Greenwich Mean Time, which
comes at 7 P.M. Eastern time. ``There's still a regular midnight,''
he said, referring to local time. And among the public, he said,
``There's still some anxiety over that. But we'll know at 7
o'clock.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to Long, of 423 systems that are considered ``mission
critical,'' or required for safe functioning of the system, 151
required modification.
</P>
<P>
   Officials discovered that many of the agency's systems were
``date dumb.'' For example, they found that among their 627
computer systems, there were 11,027 ``interfaces,'' or places where
the systems passed information among them. But only 485 of the
interfaces handle date-related information, and of those, only 119,
or about 1 percent, had a date problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone through a great deal of testing, a great deal of
analysis, a lot of work, a lot of manpower, to pretty much prove to
the world what we knew all along, that there's not a lot of risk in
our system,'' said Jim May, the test manager.
</P>
<P>
   Officials picked Denver for the test because its backup
computers could be isolated from computers handling ``live''
traffic, and have their clocks advanced to New Year's Eve. A second
set of controllers sat at the second set of screens, monitored all
``live'' conversations, and made corresponding entries on their
isolated system, as if they had been controlling the planes.
</P>
<P>
   A second FAA aircraft, a Lear Jet, flew a circuitous route to
test equipment in several places. And United Airlines filed flight
plans for 14 flights, leaving shortly before midnight or shortly
after, to see if the FAA computers advanced to New Year's Eve could
accept the requests and issue clearances smoothly by the standard
electronic route to United's main computer in Chicago and then to
computer printers at boarding gates, where pilots pick them up.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate test a month ago, the agency successfully issued
such a clearance directly into the on-board computer of one of
United's most advanced planes, a Boeing 747-400, with that plane's
on-board clock advanced to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That plane was on the ground, and in the test here, with the
exception of the conversations with the Convair, handling of
aircraft in flight was not affected, officials stressed.
</P>
<P>
   By last month, the FAA had finished devising a Y2K fix _ or
determined that none was necessary _ for every critical system, and
for 218 noncritical ones, and had tested all the fixes. Sunday's
test was of many of those computer systems linked together in their
normal working environment. The last step, about 88 percent
complete and expected to continue until June, Mr. Long said, is to
install all the fixes.
</P>
<P>
   Renovations on critical systems are running slightly behind
renovations on noncritical ones, however.

PIAZZA PLACED ON DISABLED LIST UNTIL APRIL 25  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The New York Mets announced on Sunday, as expected,
that the All-Star catcher Mike Piazza would be placed on the 15-day
disabled list with a sprained right knee. The move will be
retroactive to Saturday, and Piazza will be eligible to come off
the disabled list April 25.
</P>
<P>
   The team received good news Sunday about the condition of
Piazza's knee, which he injured running the bases here Friday
night. Dr. David Altchek, a team physician, examined Piazza and
said the sprain involved just the medial collateral ligament, and
not the posterior cruciate ligament as well.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Piazza said he was ``really, really frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not want to go on the disabled list,'' Piazza said by
telephone from Manhattan, where he underwent a magnetic resonance
imaging test on Saturday. ``I felt like I could play in a week. But
the doctor made it clear that if I do play and run the bases and
have to suddenly change direction, it could be a full tear. And
that would mean surgery. Considering that possibility, I figure
this is for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Piazza, who signed a seven-year contract worth
$91 million in the off season, had been on the disabled list just
once in his six-plus seasons in the major leagues, when he tore a
thumb ligament in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with the decision in a way,'' Piazza said. ``I
hyperflexed my same knee on a slide in 1996 and kept playing on it
and it kind of hung around for a month. This way, hopefully it will
be 100 percent when I come back. But I'm not happy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who said he would be at Shea Stadium for the Mets' home
opener on Monday, was batting .429 in five games with a pair of
home runs and eight runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was swinging the bat well when it happened, so
it's very frustrating,'' he said. ``But when I'm eligible to come
off the disabled list, I'll be ready to play. I'll be able to jump
right back in without missing a beat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who also face the loss of the starter Rick Reed to a
strained Achilles' tendon, are expected to make one or more
personnel moves before Monday's game. The utility players Melvin
Mora, Craig Paquette and Shane Halter and the minor league catchers
Pedro Grifol and Jerry Brooks are among those who could be called
up. The team's best catching prospect, Vance Wilson, took a ball
off his left arm last week and will not be able to play for several
more days.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets may also decide they want to recall a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever moves the Mets make, Manager Bobby Valentine said he
could see Piazza putting in time at first base when he returns, to
lessen the strain on his knee.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza did not sound very comfortable with the idea of playing
anywhere but behind the plate. But he said he would do whatever the
team wanted.

RUSSIA'S TROUBLED NUCLEAR POWER NETWORK SEEKS OUTSIDE HELP 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The company that operates 29 nuclear power plants
in Russia, long unable to collect cash for its electricity sales,
is looking for investments from Western governments or companies
interested in sharing control of the reactors.
</P>
<P>
   The director general of the Russian Electric Power Co., touring
the United States with a group of Russian nuclear officials, said
in a recent interview that the enterprise was expected to run a
deficit of $60 million this year, $200 million next year and $400
million the year after that.
</P>
<P>
   The company lacks money to pay workers, perform maintenance and
repairs, inspect crucial piping and even to buy fuel, said the
official, Sergei Ivanov. At times the plants have only two or three
days of fuel on hand, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To prevent possible catastrophes in the field of nuclear
power, we need to organize some kind of new international body that
will supervise the work of this network, not only from the point of
view of technical support, which is usual, but financial investment
support,'' Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
   The international group, he added, would manage the investments
in the plants directly, rather than sending the funds through
``well-known government thieves.'' Day-to-day operations would
remain in Russian hands.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects for such investments seem uncertain at best. The
proposal is another sign of the tremendous change in Russia, and in
the nuclear industry that, through most of the post-Soviet era, was
tightly linked to weapons production. While cash shortages are
endemic throughout Russian business and industry, nuclear power
officials point to the obvious fact that reactor problems in Russia
could affect other nations. They argue, therefore, that other
nations, including the United States, should help find solutions.
</P>
<P>
   One anticipated difficulty is that Ivanov would like to use some
of the foreign investment money to complete three partly built
reactors _ one of which is the same design as those at the
Chernobyl Atomic Energy Station in Ukraine, scene of the 1986
explosion and fire. Two others are similar to Westinghouse plants
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in a state of intense desperation,'' said Stephen
Kotkin, director of Russian studies at Princeton University. He met
with Ivanov and other Russians when the delegation visited a
conference on the world economy held last month at the Milken
Institute, a nonprofit research organization in Santa Monica,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have some knowledge of market economies and they have a
fantasy that outsiders will invest,'' Kotkin said. ``Equity
interest, bonds _ they'll go for anything. Everything is
negotiable.''
</P>
<P>
   Without some help, though, Kotkin said, ``this is going to
blow.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said the effort seemed highly
preliminary. One administration expert said that the Russians had
little of the data they would need to interest Western investors _
including estimates of their costs. They also lack clear prospects
of selling power to customers who can pay cash that, in turn, could
be used to repay loans or provide dividends on investments.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, groups in the United States that usually oppose
operation of nuclear reactors in this country have argued that
giving aid to improve safety at Russian plants may only prolong the
lives of those plants, when it would be safer to let the plants be
closed. The idea of spending Western money to build additional
reactors in Russia, especially a graphite-moderated model like the
one that exploded at Chernobyl, would be extremely unpopular with
some groups.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The unfinished graphite reactor is at Kursk; there are
unfinished water-moderated reactors, similar in outline to American
models, at Kalinin and Rostov.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian delegation, which includes the director of the company
that owns the non-nuclear generating stations and the transmission
network, and the director of the agency that regulates nuclear
safety, has been meeting with government and private officials in
Los Angeles and New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian problem, say members of the delegation and Americans
who have studied the situation, is in part the structure of their
electric industry, which has many inefficient plants. But, on top
of that, only 30 percent to 40 percent of electricity bills are
paid in currency. The rest are paid in barter goods, priced by the
producer, often at unrealistically high values.
</P>
<P>
   The money goes to provincial utilities and to the Unified Energy
System of Russia, which owns the non-nuclear generating stations
and the transmission lines. Unified Energy spends much of the money
on natural gas and coal to fuel its own plants, because miners and
drillers can demand money or export their product to other
countries that will pay in hard currency, American analysts say.
But the nuclear power company has no such leverage.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear power company receives only about 10 percent of its
payments in currency, said one American official. Another 60
percent or so is barter, and some of the bills simply go unpaid.
Ivanov confirmed this. He said that industrial customers tended to
offer whatever they produced as payment _ steel, chemicals or
manufactured goods _ but that others, like hospitals and army
bases, offered nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   One Clinton administration official, speaking on the condition
of anonymity, said that many of the Russian plants were approaching
the end of their 30-year design lives and showed symptoms of age.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian company would like to close nine of its older
reactors, but it says it has no money for decommissioning them. It
says its best prospect for earning that money is to build
additional reactors and sell the power.
</P>
<P>
   Some American experts contend that the Russians could afford to
close many more generating stations, though _ especially if they
buy more efficient motors and lighting and heating systems, as
Americans have done.

   IRS Doing Fewer Audits On High-Income Returns
</P>
<P>
   Tax returns from Americans earning more than $100,000 a year and
from the biggest corporations are increasingly escaping the
scrutiny of the Internal Revenue Service, new agency figures show.
</P>
<P>
   While audit rates over all have fallen substantially since 1986,
some tax experts and former IRS officials are worried that the
steepening decline in high-income and corporate audits may mean
that reporting by many of the richest taxpayers is now effectively
on an honor system, inviting abuses.

   3 Industries Pass Year 2000 Tests
</P>
<P>
   Three major industries racing to prepare their computers for the
Year 2000 _ securities, the electric utilities and the airlines _
all passed important testing milestones recently.
</P>
<P>
   A trickle of new lawsuits in recent months is expanding the
legal landscape of the Year 2000 problem. But so far, the cases
offer little support for the dire predictions that courts will be
choked by litigation over the issue.

   A Magazine for the Tourist Class
</P>
<P>
   The two mainstay travel magazines _ Travel &AMP; Leisure and Conde
Nast Traveler _ are dealing with a feisty newcomer: Arthur
Frommer's Budget Travel, a quarterly that has met with such
newsstand success that it will be published bimonthly starting in
September. Its newsstand sales _ twice those of its larger cousins
_ made the stalwarts take note. But it was Frommer's editor's
letter in his premiere issue last summer that really stung. Frommer
proclaimed that current travel magazines are ``elitist, haughty and
high-society.''

   Fan Material Finds Niche Online
</P>
<P>
   Although online entertainment programming initially turned out
to be a disappointment for many companies, there is a resurgence of
entertainment-based material on the Internet. Rather than original
programming, though, the biggest successes are the most derivative:
online extensions of music, TV shows and movies that fans already

   A Century of Advertising
</P>
<P>
   In an exercise likely to cause lively debate, the trade
publication Advertising Age is offering a special retrospective
issue devoted to what the editors label ``the advertising
century,'' listing the top icons, campaigns and people. First among
the issue's most contentious designations would undoubtedly be the
declaration of the Marlboro Man as first on a list of the top 10
icons, followed by figures like Ronald McDonald, the Jolly Green
Giant, Betty Crocker and the Energizer bunny.

   SHARR MOUNTAINS, Macedonia-Yugoslavia Border _ With official
border crossings closed, thousands of refugees took to these
snow-capped mountains on foot Sunday in a desperate and dangerous
attempt to flee Serbian terror within Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers feared as many as 200,000 refugees could be hiding
in the forests and mountains of Kosovo along the Macedonian and
Albanian borders, as Serbs continue to prevent them from leaving
and have even laid land mines to ensure they do not.
</P>
<P>
   At least 500 refugees were seized here in the last two days by
Macedonian police patrolling the mountain passes. Police officials
said they then bused the hungry and cold families to refugee camps
ringed with barbed wire inside Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Shivering, distraught, and with two broken ankles, Urmije
Selmani, 30, survived a three-day ordeal escaping through the
mountains. She told of her ordeal from a stretcher in an emergency
medical tent at the border Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no other way. I was dead if I stayed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers estimate thousands have have sneaked through the
steep inclines and snowdrifts of the mountain range, and are hiding
in the homes of ethnic Albanian families in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   But the ethnic Albanians who manage to escape to Macedonia have
walked into a country that is growing increasingly resentful of the
wave of refugees and fearful that the new arrivals will upset the
delicate ethnic equation here.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians represent about 25 percent of Macedonia's
population of 2 million people. Many Macedonians, whose numbers are
about 65 percent Slavic and 5 percent Serbian, fear that the
Albanian government has designs to use the refugee crisis to carve
out a ``greater Albania.''
</P>
<P>
   That specter threatens to ignite even more tensions in the
already blazing Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Angira Shuku, 28, was waiting on the road just over the mountain
pass to see if her father and mother, who she last heard from a
week ago inside the Kosovo capital of Pristina, might have tried to
flee through the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray they make it through,'' she said, casting her gaze
toward the distant mountains. ``But the truth is they will face the
same hatred here in Macedonia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Macedonian government, which is eager to join the European
Union, has been careful not to go too far in mistreating the
fleeing Albanians, but observers have described it as brutal. There
have been steady reports of Macedonian police and army troops
beating ethnic Albanians and, on some occasions, turning them back
at the border. The Macedonian government outraged humanitarian aid
workers when they rounded up tens of thousands of refugees in the
middle of the night last week and, without telling them where they
were being taken, began busing them to neighboring Albania.
</P>
<P>
   NATO forces built a string of refugee camps in Macedonia and
have had a heavy presence protecting the Albanians. But Sunday,
NATO announced it would begin a gradual withdrawal, touching off
panic among the refugees that they would be left at the hands of
the Macedonian police.
</P>
<P>
   The resentment among the Macedonians ripples beyond the camps
and into the community.
</P>
<P>
   There is anti-Albanian graffiti throughout the Slavic and
Serbian neighborhoods of the capital, Skopje, and plenty of hateful
insults are muttered on the street.
</P>
<P>
   In the stone churches that dot the remote villages in the
foothills here, Serbian and Macedonian Christians attended
candlelight Easter services Sunday. They seemed indifferent to the
fact that, less than a mile into the mountains, Albanians were
running for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Athanasius's Eastern Orthodox Church in the village of
Leshok, Bishop Kiril said, ``The Albanians cannot stay here. They
talk openly of a greater Albania and this is what they want to
accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about how he balanced the Christian belief in helping
those in need with his views on the refugees, Bishop Kiril said,
``My message Monday is to help those who may be fleeing. Accept
them, clothe them, feed them for three days. After that, ask them
where they want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   During a party held by the bishop for the wealthy Christians who
own vacation homes in the mountains, families sat at a large picnic
table covered with a linen tablecloth and discussed the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Dragalubia Lazov, general manager of the Macedonian lottery,
said, ``This is like the US getting 25 million refugees dropped on
its doorstep in one week. What do you think the reaction would
be?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are coming. You see it on the street and in our towns. We
feel surrounded,'' he added. ``I am very afraid of this. If they
try for a greater Albania, there will be a war. That is a
certainty.''
</P>
<P>
   The small Slavic village is indeed surrounded by three towns
overwhelmingly populated by ethnic Albanians. Minarets of mosques
tower over a sprawling community in Leshok that is now expanding
even further as thousands of refugees from Kosovo are packing into
the homes of extended family members. Some houses have as many as
50 people living in three bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The Macedonians argue that the arrival of 130,000 refugees into
their struggling country, which broke off from Yugoslavia in 1992,
will not only put strain on the economy but has already increased
the Albanian proportion here by almost 7 percent overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonian demographic specialists said that if the refugees
stay, their percentage of the population would surge to a majority
in less than a generation because of the high Albanian birth rate.
</P>
<P>
   Down the hill from the church and the bishop's party, a group of
village men were drinking beer and pulling hard on cigarettes in
the town common.
</P>
<P>
   Yastre Popouski, 44, a foreman at a textile factory and a father
of two teenagers, said, ``The refugees have to go back to Kosovo.
Why should we let them come in here and take the jobs from our
kids?''
</P>
<P>
   On the same hillside between the church and the town common, an
Albanian refugee from Kosovo was hiding in the office of a friend
who is a physician. The refugee, a 52-year-old professor of
economics, said he was frightened that he may be discovered by the
Macedonians and asked that his identity not be revealed.
</P>
<P>
   He said ethnic Albanians in Macedonia, where members of his
extended family live, face institutionalized racism, economic
inequality, and pure hatred.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were given the same rights, there would be no need for a
greater Albania,'' he said. ``But we cannot live like that. We will
not live like that. And that is why we will see more violence.''

   Hip-hop magazines like Blaze are hailing Prince Paul as a
genius, an Einstein. Another magazine, Request, says his new CD,
``Prince Among Thieves,'' is ``a social and musical masterwork.''
Vibe calls ``Prince Among Thieves'' ``the world's first
hip-hopera.''
</P>
<P>
   A rap opera? Well, that may be hyperbole. ``Prince Among
Thieves'' is an album, and it has never been performed live.
``Anything I do, they give it a name,'' said the artist, Paul
Huston, a shy, visionary 31-year-old from Long Island. ``I call it
a movie on wax.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was writing a real cool movie'' or ``an
adult-kiddie record,'' he said. ``You listen to the story, and it
goes into song.''
</P>
<P>
   As a producer he has helped transform rap from a relatively
simple form, with a steady beat and bragging lyrics about ghetto
life and female treachery, into something more complex. In rap the
producer is the one who creates the soundtrack, as opposed to the
M.C. or the rapper who composes the rhymes.
</P>
<P>
   Huston's albums, particularly those he produced for the
groundbreaking group De La Soul, are zany collages of skits,
parodies, music from the television show ``Spiderman'' and samples
of anything from classical music to language-instruction records.
Now he is advancing the form further.
</P>
<P>
   What makes ``Prince Among Thieves'' different from most rap CDs
is that it has a story line running all the way through it. Like
the librettos of many great operas, this one seems stark in
synopsis.
</P>
<P>
   The CD begins with sirens and a minor-key melody. Tariq, a
would-be rapper played by Breeze, and his best friend, True, played
by Sha, both relative unknowns, have shot each other after an
argument, and as Tariq lies wounded, his life flashes before him.
</P>
<P>
   His problems began when he needed $1,000 to finish a rap demo to
show to RZA of Wu-Tang Clan, and True enticed him into selling
drugs for Large (played by the rapper Chubb Rock), a billionaire
crime boss who also deals in ``loan sharking, gambling, nuclear
weapons,'' says Tariq. As Tariq earns money selling crack, his
customers are played by the comedian Chris Rock and members of De
La Soul. Tariq buys a gun from Crazy Lou (played by Kool Keith, or
Dr. Octagon). Crazy Lou ``was an ex-Marine captain who got
discharged for sexual misconduct with a deadly weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Count Mackula, ``a pimp supreme,'' (played by the sex
symbol rapper, Big Daddy Kane) lures Tariq to an assignation with a
prostitute: ``Hoes come a dime a dozen, baby.'' While Tariq is in
flagrante delicto, the police storm in. ``Anything you say can be
twisted around and used against you,'' says a cop, played by
Everlast from the Irish rap group House of Pain.
</P>
<P>
   Tariq's mother sends a minister to bail him out. After his
release, he overhears True rapping to his music; he has hijacked
the record contract that Tariq was working toward. Like many
operas, ``Prince Among Thieves'' ends in tragedy. Tariq dies, but
True survives because he had on a bullet-proof vest.
</P>
<P>
   And like much gangsta rap, it is a cautionary tale but also a
satire of hip-hop machismo and a sly comment on how art and life
intersect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prince Among Thieves'' is filled with Huston's distinctive
touches, samples from Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, ``Popeye the
Sailor Man'' and voices pushed through distorting filters. It
sounds, Blaze magazine said, like ``Jonathan Swift smoked a blunt
with Rodgers and Hammerstein, then invited the Juice Crew over.''
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop magazines often show Prince Paul dressed in a typical
rapper's tough-guy garb, leather jacket, wool cap or baseball cap
on backward and dark glasses. But he usually wears jeans and a
button-down-collar shirt. Despite the lyrics on his albums, Huston
says his mother, Peggy, does not drink, smoke or swear. She likes
her son's music.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you want to move,'' she said. But the lyrics? ``If I
hear a bad word, I just blank it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Huston is temporarily at home with his mother and his son, Paul
Jr., 7, in a pleasant house in Massapequa until he buys a place by
himself. He went to court to gain custody of Paul from the boy's
mother, his former girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge looked at me, a young, black, male rapper,'' Huston
said, and awarded custody of the boy to his mother. Huston
appealed. Paul Jr. now spends the school year with his father and
summers with his mother in the South. Huston has a steady
girlfriend, Atiya Clymer.
</P>
<P>
   He composes tracks in the basement. ``He's like some kid who
must have spent some time in his bedroom at home coming up with
really strange fantasies,'' said Monica Lynch, president of Tommy
Boy Music, which released ``Prince Among Thieves.'' His love of
music came from his father, Thomas, now dead, who was a truck
driver and jazz enthusiast, Huston said. His mother was a home
health aide.
</P>
<P>
   ``His father would take him to the park and put the radio in the
carriage,'' Mrs. Huston said. ``He used to play him `Moody's Mood
for Love.''' Huston has woven that jazz favorite into ``Prince
Among Thieves'' ``as a dedication,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Huston had little music training. ``I took clarinet in the
second grade for one month,'' he said. But ``I had a mean
teacher,'' and he quit. Today he mostly plays the synthesizer.
</P>
<P>
   Young Paul's idol was George Clinton, leader of the
unpredictable Parliament-Funkadelic. He watched the D.J.'s in the
park on Great Neck Road. He saw Biz Markie, sometimes called ``the
human beat box'' for his vocal imitations of percussion sounds, and
Rakim, known for his complex, metaphoric rhymes. In junior high
Paul became a D.J. at parties. He used samples from old records,
``Batman'' and ``The Dating Game'' theme and played records
backward and with the turntable upside down.
</P>
<P>
   The three members of De La Soul graduated from Amityville High
School, though Huston didn't know them there. ``You'd think, `Yeah,
this is one of Amityville's best,''' said Kelvin Mercer, who is
Posdnous (that's ``soundsop'' backward) of De La Soul.
</P>
<P>
   At a housing project party in Brooklyn at which Huston was the
D.J., Daddy-O and Delite of of the hip-hop group Stetsasonic saw
him and were impressed enough to seek his services. They were
wearing spikes and leather, and he thought they intended to beat
him up. But eventually he produced the title track for their 1988
CD ``In Full Gear.'' When the members of Stetsasonic visited his
house, they told his mother he was a genius.
</P>
<P>
   Huston went to Five Towns College, a music school. ``A waste of
time,'' he said. Through his high school music teacher, who had
been a drummer with the Isley Brothers, he met Maseo, the D.J. for
De La Soul. Maseo introduced him to Posdnous and Trugoy,
(``yogurt'' backward) the Dove. They had the same visionary and
irreverent attitude toward rap as Huston did and were eager to
carry rap from the ghetto to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respected all those rappers,'' Posdnous said. ``But
obviously we were not seeing that every day growing up in Long
Island. There was so much to talk about instead of just drugging.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   De La Soul's first album, ``Three Feet High and Rising,''
produced by Huston in 1989, revolutionized rap. It had words from a
French language instruction record, along with a game show parody
with questions like, How many fibers in a shredded wheat biscuit?
and How many feathers on a Perdue chicken? It was probably the
first rap album to intersperse songs with skits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it would bug people out,'' Huston said. The album went
platinum.
</P>
<P>
   Huston worked on ``De La Soul Is Dead,'' released in 1991, which
went gold. De La Soul's ``Buhloone Mind State'' in 1993, which
Huston produced, won over critics but not the public. ``We were
beginning to take on more serious stakes,'' said Mercer. ``A lot of
rhymes were very complicated,'' he said, ``not tangible for the
average person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to get our message to certain youth who needed to
hear it,'' he said. Huston bowed out of the group's next album,
``Stakes Is High.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My style has been quirky, they're maturing,'' Huston said.
``I'm still like the high school guy that puts something on the
door that will fall on your head. I had to accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Wu-Tang Clan's producer, RZA, and the rappers Too
Poetic and Fruitkwan he formed the Gravediggaz, which released a
camp-horror album, ``Six Feet Deep,'' in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving De La Soul, ``I had this music nobody ever
liked,'' Huston said. He found a psychoanalysis self-help record
and made a CD, ``Psychoanalysis (What Is It?),'' in 1996. It
consists of rappers' raunchy dreams and fantasies with comments
from a psychoanalyst with a Viennese accent. ``It's a beautiful
night for a date rape,'' one line goes, ``a beautiful night for a
homicide.''
</P>
<P>
   The album is a macho fantasy. ``A lot of my friends I hang out
with, we're really nice guys,'' he said. ``We just took the
craziest people we knew, and we were going to make it 10 times
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a joke that went too far,'' Huston said. ``The next
thing, I'm getting write-ups about people getting shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that record was the end of my career,'' he added.
``Next thing, all the work comes in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Library of Congress asked to use the CD cover in its touring
exhibit ``Sigmund Freud: Conflict and Culture,'' which opens Sunday
at the Jewish Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychoanalysis'' also attracted Chris Rock's attention. ``He
really approaches it like a comedian,'' Rock said of Huston's work.
His recordings ``aren't just good rap albums, they're really
funny,'' Rock said.
</P>
<P>
   He asked Huston to produce his comedy album ``Roll With the
New,'' which won a Grammy in 1997. He is negotiating with Huston to
make a movie of ``Prince Among Thieves.''
</P>
<P>
   Huston's work is ``smart without being preachy,'' Rock said.
``He makes fun of that stuff all the time. It just seemed right up
my alley.''
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be a bond between the two men. ``One reason Chris
and I are friends is that we're both nerds,'' Huston said.

<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ky._ Wondertross, the favorite who ran sixth in the
Blue Grass Stakes on Saturday, went to the hospital Sunday with a
case of colic that probably added him to the list of casualties for
the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   But an even longer list of candidates for Louisville is growing,
because no dominant horse has emerged from this year's trials and
prep races. From California, from Arkansas, even from Dubai ,
3-year-old contenders are being primed for the trip of their lives,
suggesting a wide-open field that would have to be reduced to the
maximum number of 20 starters by Derby officials at Churchill
Downs.
</P>
<P>
   The newest star to rise toward the top of the list is Menifee,
who won the Blue Grass in the final strides over Cat Thief and
Vicar. He seems certain to head for the Kentucky Derby as one of
the favorites along with Prime Timber and General Challenge, the
stars of Bob Baffert's richly stocked West Coast barn.
</P>
<P>
   So another shootout appears likely between Baffert, who won the
last two runnings of the Kentucky Derby with Silver Charm and Real
Quiet, and Elliott Walden, whose Victory Gallop ran second in the
Derby and Preakness last year before snatching the Triple Crown
sweep away from Real Quiet in the Belmont Stakes. It is Walden who
stands in Baffert's path again this year as the trainer of Menifee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like he came out of it in good shape,'' a beaming
Walden said Sunday morning outside Barn 36 at Keeneland. ``Now,
it's time to get ready for the Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   Menifee won the Blue Grass as the fourth choice in a strong
field of eight colts. It was his fourth victory in five starts, his
first around two turns, his first in a stakes race and his first in
a Grade I stakes.
</P>
<P>
   He is a sleek bay son of Harlan and the mare Anne Campbell, and
he is owned by his breeder, Arthur Hancock 3rd _ the elder son of
the legendary Bull Hancock of Claiborne Farm _ and Arthur Hancock's
longtime friend, Jimmy Stone, an oil and gas executive from New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no joy at Nick Zito's barn, where Wondertross was
moved from his stall at 8 a.m. to an equine clinic for treatment
for an intestinal inflammation. The colt lost the Florida Derby
last month by a nose to Vicar after a rousing rush to the wire, and
became an instant contender for the Kentucky Derby. But he never
got going in the Blue Grass and finished a badly beaten sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no excuse,'' said Jerry Bailey, his jockey. ``From
the gate to the wire, he was never in the race. It's the worst race
he's ever run.''
</P>
<P>
   Zito, in a more temperate mood, said after the race: ``I'm
confused. I don't know what happened. I'm totally mystified.''
</P>
<P>
   But this morning, Zito was guardedly optimistic about getting
his horse back on the Derby trail, saying: ``We left the barn last
night about 8 o'clock. He was kicking and bucking. I thought
everything was fine. This morning, we had to get him over to the
clinic. We hope to get him back quickly. If we can get him back on
the track and back to where he was, we'll see. But we have to take
one step at a time.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Zito was left with at least two potential starters for the
Derby: Adonis, who won the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct Saturday while
Wondertross was striking out at Keeneland, and Stephen Got Even,
who won the Turfway Stakes a week ago. The trainer also announced
that Jorge Chavez would continue to ride Adonis, and that Chris
McCarron would ride Stephen Got Even in the Triple Crown series.
</P>
<P>
   The list of horses trying to qualify for the Derby grew over the
weekend to somewhere between 20 and 30, meaning that prize money
already won would be invoked to determine who makes the cut.
</P>
<P>
   From the Blue Grass alone, the top five finishers were booked
for May 1 in Churchill Downs: Menifee, Cat Thief, Vicar, Kimberlite
Pipe and Lemon Drop Kid. From the West Coast, there were Baffert's
two stars plus a pair of fine fillies, Silverbulletday and
Excellent Meeting.
</P>
<P>
   From the Arkansas Derby there was the 30-1 winner, Valhol, who
somehow raced into prominence in his third start, and from Dubai
the highly regarded Worldly Manner, who hasn't raced since he won
the Del Mar Futurity last September.
</P>
<P>
   D. Wayne Lukas, the trainer of Cat Thief, put the Derby into
perspective: ``We don't have a great horse; just a good, solid
horse like so many other guys this year. We're not overpowering,
but neither is anybody else. There are no Spectacular Bids or
Seattle Slews out there this year.''  &QL;

 &HT;    Once again, The Shark sinks to second
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ The moment was fleeting. Greg Norman led the
Masters by himself at Sunday's final round at Augusta National, an
eagle on No. 13 sending him to the top of the leaderboard and the
massive gallery into a frenzy. The view from there must have been
majestic. This lasted all of two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   His playing partner at the Masters was friend Jose Maria
Olazabal, who had led by a shot but then trailed by one when
Norman's 25-foot, right-to-left putt dropped. It was Olazabal's
turn, from 21 feet for a birdie and share of the lead, and he
nailed it. The Great White Shark's moment was over.
</P>
<P>
   And, essentially, so was his quest to earn the elusive green
jacket. Norman bogeyed the next hole and was unable to make a
birdie in the remaining four, dropping to third behind Davis Love
III and champion Olazabal, who finished at 8-under for the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   It was a piercing defeat for Norman, who had a four-day total of
283, including Sunday's 73. But it was also rewarding. He had a
legitimate shot with five holes to play on the same course that
made him an international sympathetic figure. The 1996 meltdown was
that bad, one of the worst in majors history: squandering a
six-shot lead on the last day to Nick Faldo. But Sunday he did not
collapse. He was valiant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a successful week and a sad week all rolled up into
one,'' he said. ``I feel good I'm back where I know I can contend
again. This is not a heartbreak. I'd like to say I could've won. I
had my chances. I got my nose to the front, but not all the way
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``(So) this is easier to take,'' he added. ``Ninety-six was a
totally different animal - the tournament, the emotions, the way I
lost. I climbed a pretty good mountain today.''
</P>
<P>
   He was talking the confirmation of his physical recovery from
shoulder surgery and, most importantly, his mental strength. When
he finished Saturday one shot off the lead, the questions persisted
everywhere about his ability to hold up after having imploded on
the '96 Sunday. Norman answered them in impressive, if not
victorious, fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty good with myself and what I did,'' he said.
``Don't take that the wrong way. I'm sad I lost. . . But don't make
a mountain out of a molehill on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: He lost, but it was more the course and Olazabal
beating him than himself.
</P>
<P>
   Norman did contribute, however. His tee shot on No. 14 hit a fan
and landed in the rough. His 7-iron second shot from 138 yards
carried to the back fringe of the green and he 3-putted for bogey -
his taste of first gone.
</P>
<P>
   Then Norman dropped to third when he made a six on the par-5 15.
Still, he held on to hope until the end, even after Olazabal
matched his par on a tough putt on 17, a green so slick Love called
it ``unplayable.'' Down two shots going to 18, Norman mused to
himself: ``If I make a 2 (on 18) like somebody else did to me, I
might still have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't. Olazabal was unshakable. Norman embraced him when it
was over, a very different embrace from the one Faldo gave Norman
in '96. This time, the Shark, 44, had enough reason to talk of
playing into his 50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a warrior in that arena is what it's all about,'' he
said. ``It was an enormous emotional experience. . . I put
everything into perspective. The reality is that I came out, played
hard, but not well enough to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he enjoy golf more now that before the Masters, Norman,
victor in defeat, answered: ``Absolutely.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Majria Shala's favorite cousin drove her to
Kennedy International Airport for an Easter visit to Detroit, she
remembers him making a little joke: ``Maybe when you get back, I
will be gone to liberate Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shala was still in Michigan last Friday when her cousin,
Victor Ljekocag, called her on the phone. ``He said, `I'm going to
be a soldier,' '' Ms. Shala recalled Sunday. `` `I love my country.
If you want to see me, come Sunday at 1.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Ljekocag and about 300 other Albanian-Americans _ mostly
young men, and a handful of women _ formed ranks on a parking lot
in Yonkers, N.Y., dressed in newly bought camouflage fatigues
bearing the red-and-gold insignia of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteer soldiers _ who included a 17-year-old female high
school student from the Bronx and a 60-year-old man _ were to fly
from Kennedy International Airport this week to an undisclosed city
in Europe, and from there to training grounds in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian emigres say it is a story repeated in Albanian
communities in Europe since NATO started bombing Yugoslavia and the
Serbs drove hundreds of thousands of the ethnic Albanian majority
in Kosovo from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   While all the recruits in Yonkers say they have relatives in
Kosovo, many were born in the United States, and some have never
set foot in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shala and 15 or 16 relatives flew in early Sunday to see
Ljekocag off. `` We all tried to stop him,'' she said. `` But he's
doing it from the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   As patriotic exhortations of Albanian-American leaders boomed
from loudspeakers, the recruits and the crush of their relatives
shivered in the raw chilly wind _ weather that seemed to match both
the fervor and sorrow in the air. One woman, her faced spotted with
rain and tears, spoke of her relatives on the way to the Balkans to
fight in the ranks of a rebel army that is heavily outgunned by the
Yugoslavs.
</P>
<P>
   ``One brother-in-law, three sons, my favorite uncle,'' she said.
``I don't know if they are coming back, but Milosevic is a Hitler,
this is another Holocaust. But it's happening now, in real life,
not on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   People around the country have felt revulsion at the
developments in Kosovo, but for Albanian-Americans _ many of whom
have family members in Kosovo _ these weeks have been the most
agonizing in a year of grief, since the undeclared war between
Serbian security forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army erupted in
March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The calls for volunteers to stave off the destruction of the
homeland began showing up in Albanian-language newspapers and radio
programs after the first NATO bombings three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to that time, the KLA wanted our money more,'' said Shaban
Brahimaj, a computer programmer who lives in the Bronx and is an
American citizen. ``However, now they are saying `Help our country
now or it will be never.' ''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There is no way to tell whether these new recruits will ever
make it into Kosovo, or fight battles there. But the deep
attachment of Albanian-Americans to Albania itself, and by
extension to Kosovo, is evident.
</P>
<P>
   They say they had long sent money to the underground Albanian
government of the Serbian province, founded after Slobodan
Milosevic, now the Yugoslav president, stripped Kosovo of autonomy
in 1989 and ethnic Albanians were either fired from or quit their
state jobs. A parallel society emerged, in which Albanians ran
their own schools, hospitals and media, and a government-in-exile
ran the distribution of funds gathered abroad to fund Albanian
institutions in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Since the massacre of KLA fighters and their families in Kosovo
in March last year, which galvanized support for the previously
ragtag rebel army within Kosovo, the vast majority of expatriate
Albanians began supporting the guerrillas, too. The money enabled
the rebels to buy guns, and helped its ranks swell.
Albanian-American community leaders say there are about 500,000
people of Albanian descent in the United States, half in New York,
New Jersey and Connecticut. They are now donating tens of thousands
of dollars to the rebels, according to Hysni Syla, a KLA
representative for the United States and Canada. Those figures
could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, about 300 would-be soldiers gathered at a
catering hall in North Bergen, N.J., for the first meeting _ a kind
of strategy session and pep rally _ of the rebels' newest American
recruits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must fight the big beast!'' cried a man who said he
represented the guerrillas. ``We must liberate the motherland!
Today we are all Albanians in Kosovo!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We may die,'' shouted one man. ``But not Kosovo!''
</P>
<P>
   Many feel torn between their country overseas and their lives
and family here. Shaban Brahimaj, for one, has to support his
parents, wife, 5-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son, and a niece,
13, who is orphaned.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't go there I would feel like a very bad person.''
</P>
<P>
   Brahimaj had volunteered for the KLA and the U.S. Army, planning
to choose the one that took him first. But last week, he received
calls from both. And Friday _ he said, with regret in his voice _
he had accepted the U.S. Army's offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had doubts,'' he said of the KLA. ``Where are they going to
get guns? And believe me you need a little training.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we are not going to a wedding,'' said Agin Gjevukaj,
26, who is joining the KLA. His family left Kosovo when he was 16
and settled in the Bronx, where he found work making pizzas. Last
week, after 10 years as a pizza-maker, he baked his last pie, quit
his job and signed up to return to Kosovo as a guerrilla.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to war _ we'll be killed, some of us. I love my
country, and my people are very strong. I am very happy.''

HERNANDEZ FLIRTS WITH PERFECTION AS YANKEES ROUT TIGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Orlando Hernandez blew hot air into his right hand
before every pitch on this chilly and nearly memorable day, staring
at catcher Jorge Posada with his serious brown eyes and focusing on
his next task.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez wanted everything to be perfect, from the warmth of
his hand to the kick of his leg to the delivery of his pitch.
Everything almost was.
</P>
<P>
   In weather better suited for football, Hernandez brought extra
drama to Yankee Stadium Sunday by retiring the first 19 Detroit
Tigers he faced. A walk to Gregg Jefferies stained the masterpiece
in the seventh inning, but Hernandez kept his no-hitter alive for
one more out. Then Tony Clark reached out and pulled an 0-2
fastball into shallow right field for Detroit's first hit.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez nodded as 32,398 fans cheered him, then blew on his
hand and went back to work. He lost the shutout, too, but the New
York Yankees' 11-2 victory was still something special.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was dominant, maybe as dominant as he was all last
year, and the Yankees, who received their 1998 World Series rings
before the rout, performed like a machine.
</P>
<P>
   Save those ring sizes, especially Hernandez'.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy can pitch,'' said Don Zimmer, the Yankees' interim
manager. ``It ain't by mistake. The guy knows how to pitch. When
they're looking for the fastball, they get the breaking ball and
vice versa.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez proved Sunday that he might be even more confusing to
hitters now that he throws more changeups from different arm angles
to complement the fastballs and sinkers he uncorks from so many
angles. The Yankees proved that they were serious about defending
their title. Real serious. Sunday's emphatic victory was their
fifth in a row after a loss in the opener.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' determination showed in the way that Hernandez, who
prefers the tropical climate of his native Cuba, toyed with the
Tigers in 44-degree weather, striking out nine, walking just one
and giving up only two hits in his seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The determination also showed in the way the Yankees used their
patience and a sprinkling of well-timed hits _ they finished with
nine walks and nine hits _ to torch the Tigers' starter, Justin
Thompson. Derek Jeter homered, drove in three runs and scored three
runs, and Paul O'Neill also knocked in three.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Yankees took a 9-0 lead behind seven hits and six walks
after three innings, the attention shifted to the pitcher known as
El Duque _ and he put on a stylish show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think about what was going on until later in the
game,'' said Hernandez, with Posada as his translator. ``I was
trying to get people out. I saw the crowd getting up and I was
getting pumped up. I wanted to do it, but it didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was a wild afternoon, reminiscent of another Sunday at
the Stadium: May 17, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminded me of David Wells' perfect game last year in that
he was that sharp,'' David Cone said. ``I thought he was that good.
It was a classic try for a perfect game or a no-hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada, who caught Wells' perfect game, started thinking about
duplicating that perfection. When Hernandez was not in the
clubhouse keeping warm, Posada abandoned the superstitious ritual
of not speaking to the still-perfect pitcher and lectured him about
the hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted it,'' Posada said. ``It was amazing that I was
catching another one. I couldn't believe it. I was trying to call
the right pitches so he could get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez retired four of the first nine batters on strikeouts,
twice going to a 3-2 count before whiffing Damion Easley and Brian
Hunter. Scott Brosius glided to his left to snare Juan
Encarnacion's grounder to start the fourth and, after Hernandez
caught Easley gazing at another 3-2 pitch, the rumbling started in
the stands.
</P>
<P>
   When Hernandez climaxed the fifth by getting Bobby Higginson on
a gorgeous 3-2 changeup, the fans' excitement grew.
</P>
<P>
   After Chuck Knoblauch snared Deivi Cruz's liner on one hop and
Tino Martinez made a neat scoop on Knoblauch's one-bounce throw to
begin the sixth, the tension was palpable. Fans who had cellular
telephones started calling their friends. El Duque was cruising.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a pitching staff like ours, anything can happen,'' Jeter
said. ``He had it today. He could have pitched a no-hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   After Hernandez struck out Encarnacion on an 0-2 changeup to
start the seventh, he fell behind, 2-0, to Jefferies. Hernandez
rebounded with a strike, but missed with a 3-1 pitch to end his
pursuit of perfection.
</P>
<P>
   The fans chanted ``Du-que, Du-que,'' trying to keep the faith
for a no-hitter. Although Hernandez went ahead of Clark, 0-2, his
fastball caught enough of the plate and Clark flicked it for a
clean single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to give the team a chance and me a chance to win,''
Hernandez said. ``I want to throw a no-hitter, but that's not the
main priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Hernandez was casual during a news conference about
losing the no-hitter, he was more animated as he returned to the
clubhouse afterward. Hernandez said Clark hit a ``good fastball,''
then he stopped walking and mimicked Clark's swing, showing how the
first baseman had reached across the plate to pull the pitch.
Hernandez shook his head and shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't see me clapping for myself just because I got a
hit,'' said Clark, who then saw Higginson follow with a run-scoring
double.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Tigers were too thrilled about their weekend trip to
New York. On Friday, Cone held them to one hit and one run in five
and one-third innings as the Yankees sailed, 12-3. On Saturday,
Roger Clemens held them to three hits over seven and two-thirds
innings in a 5-0 victory. But Sunday Hernandez might have been the
best of the imposing threesome.
</P>
<P>
   From Cone to Clemens to Hernandez. It made Detroit manager Larry
Parrish, whose team has lost five consecutive games, want to drive
the bus to the airport himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see somebody else play them right now,'' Parrish
said. ``I'm ready to get out of town.'' &QL;

SERBS SHELL ALBANIAN VILLAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite a government cease-fire called for the
Orthodox Easter weekend, Serbian forces shelled three villages in
northern Albania on Sunday. US officials in Washington, meanwhile,
gave their first hints that planning is under way for deployment of
allied ground troops into the region.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb artillery reportedly killed two civilians in Tropoje,
on the third day of fighting between Kosovar rebels and Serb forces
along the border with Albania. Yugoslav authorities accused Albania
of aiding the rebels, while Albanian leaders called on NATO to bomb
Serb positions on the border.
</P>
<P>
   In Yugoslavia, officials said a NATO missile fell on a densely
populated neighborhood in Novi Sad, the country's second-largest
city. No deaths or injuries were reported. In observance of the
religious holiday, NATO said it showed ``relative'' restraint in
the skies over Belgrade Sunday, while carrying out extensive
bombing in Kosovo. Kosovo is a province in Serbia, the dominant
republic in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William S. Cohen joined other Clinton
administration officials Sunday saying that, while he still
believes the war against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic can
be won from the air, a 1998 plan for a troop deployment exists and
could be activated ``fairly quickly'' if NATO generals request it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have an assessment that was done last fall, as far as what
it would take in a nonpermissive, or hostile environment, down to a
detailed plan . . . allowing the troops to go in,'' Cohen said on
ABC's ``This Week.'' ``So those plans could be updated fairly
quickly if such a request were ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   Armed with opinion polls that show growing public support for
ground troops, and facing the likelihood of an emotional debate in
Congress this week, the White House appeared to be laying the
groundwork Sunday for what could be a sustained, escalating, and
expensive involvement in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Other developments in the region Sunday included:
</P>
<P>
   -- &UR;  &LR; NATO officials in Brussels showed an aerial photograph of
what they said appeared to be freshly turned earth near Orahovac,
Kosovo. Colonel Konrad Fretag, a NATO spokesman, said it ``could
indicate the possibility of a mass grave site.''
</P>
<P>
   -- &UR;  &LR; International monitors likened a refugee camp, where Kosovo
Albanians live on a muddy field surrounded by armed guards, to a
``concentration camp.'' Macedonia's defense minister denied
allegations of abuse by guards and said his government was doing
the best it could with the flood of 130,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
   -- &UR;  &LR; Yugoslavia's official news agency, Tanjug, said Serb forces
fought off a ``terrorist'' incursion into Kosovo on Saturday,
killing and wounding several rebels. The Kosovo Liberation Army
operates out of mountain camps across the border in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   -- &UR;  &LR; NATO's supreme commander, General Wesley Clark said the
alliance ``was sensitive'' to the observance of Orthodox Easter by
limiting bombing over Belgrade. Despite bad weather that forced
NATO to cancel 30 percent of its missions, spokesmen said bombs
struck a munitions dump, bridges, petroleum facilities, and Serb
forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   -- &UR;  &LR; Yugoslavia's ambasssador to the United Nations said it was
``out of the question'' that his government would permit
international peacekeepers into Kosovo as an occupation force.
Vladislav Jovanovic also denied US reports of rape camps in Kosovo
as ``an entirely outrageous accusation.''
</P>
<P>
   -- &UR;  &LR; A prominent opposition Serb journalist, Slavko Curuvija,
owner of the daily Dnevni Telegraf, was shot dead outside his home
in central Belgrade. Serbian police said Curuvija had been killed
``by unknown perpetrators.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright arrived Sunday night in
Brussels, where NATO's foreign ministers prepared to meet Monday.
They were expected to reaffirm the alliance's commitment to
continued airstrikes and to holding Milosevic accountable for the
plight of the ethnic Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the Serbian attack on Albanians in Kosovo means
fewer Serb troops will permitted to remain in the province than has
been previously discussed. In another signal that US policy could
shift, she also did not not rule out partitioning Kosovo as part of
a settlement _ as long as there were guarantees to protect Orthodox
holy sites.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, White House Chief of Staff John Podesta suggested
that Yugoslavia would have to replace Milosevic if it ever were to
become a member of the European community.
</P>
<P>
   ``To create a stable situation, it looks to me like they are
going to need a new leader,'' he said on ``Meet the Press.''
Podesta added, however, that NATO airstrikes were not intended to
oust Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Other administration officials also toured the Sunday talk shows
and insisted that the NATO air campaign, now in its third week and
about to be beefed up with an additional 82 US warplanes, was going
well and would succeed on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The air campaign . . . is taking an ever-mounting toll on''
Milosevic's ``military machine,'' Clark, the NATO supreme
commander, said on ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming increasingly effective and more intense,'' he
said. ``I think we need to give the air campaign a chance to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   But several senators said US policymakers and generals are
making a serious strategic mistake if they reject the option of
using allied ground troops and have no contigency plans for a
deployment that logistically and politically could take months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's foolhardy to take the option off the table at the
outset,'' Senator John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, said on
``Fox News Sunday.'' ``Now that doesn't mean that we will get to
the point that you have to use them. It may well be that if we're
preparing more visibly to use them, that we will come quicker to
some resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, a decorated Vietnam War veteran and a member of the
Foreign Relations Committee, said he spoke to national security
adviser Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger Saturday and urged the
administration to view the ground troops option as ``a realistic
possibility to achieve our objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain of Arizona, a Republican presidential
hopeful and former prisoner of war in Vietnam, called on
congressional leaders to put forward a resolution this week that
would authorize the president to use whatever means necessary,
including ground troops, to achieve victory in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said that having such support from Congress would be
``very important,'' and that he expected Clinton to lobby lawmakers
for such a resolution in meetings over the next two days.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also said on ABC that he suspects ``we are going to find
more and more evidence of mass graves, mass executions, some pretty
horrific stories.''
</P>
<P>
   While Cohen said it remained up to NATO to make the ground
troops request, he and other administration officials indicated
such a deployment secretly has been part of the military equation
for months.
</P>
<P>
   General Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said that based on an assessment made last year, a NATO ground
force could vary in size from 20,000 to ``a couple of hundred
thousand,'' depending on ``various conditions it would take to do
the job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The build-up of a force this size would depend on how many
entry points you used coming in'' to Kosovo, Shelton said on ``This
Week.'' ``And we haven't excluded using more than one point of
entry or numerous points of entry.''
</P>
<P>
   Podesta repeated the conditions for an end to NATO airstrikes:
Milosevic must remove his forces from Kosovo, allow refugees to
return, provide a degree of autonomy, and permit installation of an
international peacekeeping force. A partition of Kosovo ``is not on
the table,'' Podesta said.
</P>
<P>
   Podesta also disclosed that the administration soon would seek
more money for the Defense Department through a supplemental budget
appropriation, but did not state a figure.
</P>
<P>
   Former vice president Dan Quayle, a Republican presidential
candidate, said Sunday the Clinton administration should pursue a
peaceful settlement in Kosovo as quickly as possible in order to
avoid more foreign-policy blunders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been thought out in the wrong way, we are a long way
down the wrong road, and there are no good options right now,''
Quayle said on ``Meet the Press.'' ``Hopefully we can get a
political settlement, we can get peace, so the Albanian Kosovars
can return to Kosovo. It has to be that way. The sooner, the
better.''

EDITORIAL: REFORM TEST IN THE HOUSE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, April 12:
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Washington Monday after two weeks off, Congress
faces debates over taxes, budgets, the minimum wage and Kosovo. But
the first priority for House members, beginning Wednesday, should
be to sign a petition demanding that Speaker Dennis Hastert
schedule a prompt vote on campaign finance reform. The petition
route has been forced by Hastert's repeated rejection of requests,
even from fellow Republicans, to schedule consideration of such
legislation rapidly enough for it to pass before the next election.
Many Republicans supporting reform are loath to join with Democrats
to challenge the speaker. But if they do not, its chances could
slip away.
</P>
<P>
   In his first months as speaker, Hastert has offered bland
promises of openness and cooperation with Democrats on the
legislative process. But whenever anyone asks him about campaign
finance reform, which commands overwhelming support in the House,
he shrugs and talks about the crowded Congressional calendar. In
fact, Congress has not done much this year and probably will not do
much until the summer, when it wrestles with appropriations bills.
The one area in which the speaker has set a frenetic pace is
fund-raising itself. He has harvested huge sums, and the money is
coming from lobbyists and special interests eager to influence
financial deregulation, health care and other items on the
Republican agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are raising money, too. A six-figure donation
earns an invitation to a ``retreat'' with the party's Congressional
leadership at the Kennedy compound in Hyannisport, Mass.
Fund-raising by presidential candidates from both parties is
already reaching into the tens of millions of dollars. By itself,
fund-raising is not going to be outlawed any time soon. But
Congress can pass the reform bill long advocated here, and
sponsored again by Reps. Christopher Shays, Republican of
Connecticut, and Martin Meehan, Democrat of Massachusetts. It would
ban open-ended party donations by corporations, unions and rich
individuals and the use of such money for partisan campaign ads at
election time by supposedly independent groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan bill passed the House last year, 252 to 179. It
commands even more support this year. But if it is not taken up in
the House before the Memorial Day recess, six weeks from now, it
could easily get pushed aside by budget and tax issues in the
summer. Hastert knows that to delay the bill is to deny its
chances. Wednesday marks the first day that lawmakers can sign the
petition to force the bill to the floor. Almost all  &QC; the House's
211 Democrats are said to be on board. If only some of the 54
Republicans on record as favoring the bill sign up, Hastert will
have to yield, as Newt Gingrich was forced to do last year.
</P>
<P>
   Shays, for party unity reasons, does not want to sign the
petition right now and confront the speaker. He thinks it would be
better to wait to see if Hastert brings the bill to the floor in
the next few weeks. But if Shays and other Republicans wait more
than a few days, they will be dooming the chances of the bill they
say they support.
</P>
<P>
   To walk away from this opportunity will consign voters to
another cycle of party fund-raising, corruption revelations and
voter cynicism. The House can do better, and it must. &QL;

METS LOSE ANOTHER PLAYER, WIN ANOTHER GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Last season, the Montreal Expos were particularly
hard on the New York Mets. So far this year, the Mets again have
experienced tough going against Montreal, though not on the
scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   One week into the new season and it seems as if magnetic
resonance imaging tests have become a part of the Mets' daily
routine.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Reed, a 16-game winner last season, strained his left
Achilles' tendon here Sunday afternoon running out what should have
been a double in the Mets' 6-3 victory over the Expos. The
right-hander will undergo an MRI in Manhattan on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza underwent his own MRI in Manhattan on Saturday after
having sprained a knee ligament in a rundown here on Friday night.
The All-Star catcher will be out for at least two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And still the Mets headed home for the first time this season
firm in their belief that they had a good week. Taking five of
seven games on the road from the two low-budget teams that had
perplexed them last season _ the Florida Marlins and the Expos _
was enough to temper the disappointment of two potentially serious
injuries to Piazza and Reed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we didn't lose them,'' manager Bobby Valentine said before
the Mets boarded their charter plane back to New York for Monday's
Shea Stadium season opener against the Marlins. ``And if we in fact
can play as well as we're capable of playing, when Mike comes back,
it will be like a shot in the arm for us. And Rick is just
temporarily sidelined. He's not lost either.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed has been bothered by his Achilles' tendon since March 26,
when he tweaked it in spring training. With the Mets trailing, 2-1,
in the top of the fourth Sunday _ and Reed only beginning to settle
down on the mound _ he tied the game with a run-scoring hit down
the left-field line. And then something happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It popped,'' Reed said of his tendon injury, which occurred as
he was halfway between first and second base. Reed struggled to
reach second and flopped headfirst toward the bag, only to be
beaten by the throw and tag. But, after writhing in pain on the
ground for several minutes, Reed was able walk off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it feels pretty good,'' Reed said after the game.
``I'm not saying I could go out and run a marathon. But I don't
think it's anything serious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he looked like he got shot was a sign that it snapped
or that there was a real bad pull,'' Valentine said. ``But now
we're very confident it wasn't torn.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have a day off Tuesday and another one a week from
Monday. So Valentine may be able to juggle his staff to let Reed
miss a turn without him going on the disabled list. But when Reed _
who led the Mets with 31 starts last season _ was asked if he felt
his Achilles' tendon injury would cause him to miss a turn, he
said: ``I don't think I will. I think I'll be OK''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Watson did not think he would be pitching when Reed got
hurt because Josias Manzanillo was warming up. But Manzanillo
experienced stiffness in his forearm, so Watson was put in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Watson failed to cover first in time on Montreal pitcher Carl
Pavano's hard grounder in the fourth, and the Expos went on to
score the go-ahead run. ``That was stupid,'' Watson said. ``I had a
brain cramp. I caught myself watching the play. I probably thought
I was still in the dugout watching the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets retook the lead, for good, in the fifth on Luis
Lopez's two-run single with the bases loaded. And Watson (1-0),
Turk Wendell, Dennis Cook, Armando Benitez and John Franco held the
Expos scoreless the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We threw the old righty, lefty, righty, lefty, righty, lefty
at them,'' the quirky Wendell said after Franco picked up the 399th
save of his career. &QL;

CHINA'S PRIME MINISTER SEES U.S., PLUS BRONCOS AND A BULL
</HEADLINE>

   CHICAGO _ Prime Minister Zhu Rongji of China took his tour of
America to the heartland Sunday, tossing footballs with Denver
Broncos, inspecting a Black Angus bull and listening to a Tibetan
sing Chinese nationalist songs.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting Denver and Chicago after sharp exchanges in Washington
over trade and human rights, Zhu tried to show an interest in
everyday Americans and their culture. But he refused to relax the
grueling pace he has set since he began an American tour in Los
Angeles a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   He zipped around the two cities in his 40-car motorcade for most
of the weekend, slackening the pace slightly Sunday evening for
private meetings with Chinese-Americans in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters calling for independence for Tibet made scattered
appearances in both cities, usually in groups of two to three
dozen, sometimes stationed on highway overpasses along the
motorcade route. One group of 30 protesters outside the Hilton
Chicago &AMP; Towers in downtown Chicago chanted, ``Red China, shame on
you'' loud enough to be heard on the upper floors of the hotel
where Zhu was staying.
</P>
<P>
   Some wariness toward China followed him from Washington. Over a
dinner of fillet of beef and Colorado spring greens, Gov. Bill
Owens of Colorado instructed Zhu, who stands third in China's
political hierarchy, on liberty and the ``American way of life.''
But the comments elicited only smiles from the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   In the tradition of senior Chinese leaders who visit America,
Zhu, well-known for his economic focus, sought to show that his
interest in America went beyond trade and technology. In late 1997,
President Jiang Zemin visited the United States and explored
Revolutionary War sites. Zhu had a more modern passion: football.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials said that although he was told that spring was
not football season, Zhu insisted on visiting the Denver Broncos
and expressed a particular interest in meeting John Elway, the
quarterback who led the Broncos to back-to-back Super Bowl
victories in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   The visit was a fumble of sorts. Zhu's interest in football
exceeded his knowledge of the game. When he visited the Broncos'
elaborate training facility outside Denver, he joked that the
uniforms and shoulder pads ``look like the garb on ancient
warriors.'' He said he did not dare wear the equipment. ``I am
afraid my legs would buckle and I would fall down if I tried,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu experimented with throwing a football on the Broncos' heated
practice turf. He first tried shoving it away from his chest, like
a medicine ball. Given a second chance, he side-armed a blistering
pass into a group of television cameras, hitting a reporter in the
face.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister seemed slightly upset when none of the
champion Broncos' big stars showed up for the event, including
Elway. There had been rumors that Elway, whom some local
politicians are hoping to recruit to run on a Republican ticket,
did not want to have his picture taken with a Chinese Communist.
But Elway put those to rest when he appeared at a dinner for Zhu on
Saturday night. Zhu also accepted a gift of a blue and orange
Broncos shirt, with ``Zhu'' and No. 7, Elway's number, on the back.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu also made a quick stop at the Denver open-air Red Rock
amphitheater. The program featured some local music. But in what
seemed like a deliberate effort to counter the ubiquitous protests
against Chinese rule of Tibet, the organizers included a
performance by a Tibetan opera singer, Dorji Ciren. He belted out a
robust version of ``My Homeland, Kind as a Mother,'' a song of
homage to mainland China akin to ``My Country Tis of Thee.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he was presented with gifts at every stop, none compared
to the 1,500-pound black Angus bull, genetically engineered by
scientists at the University of Illinois to produce calves that
make the highest grade of beef. The bull was a gift from Thomas
Pritzker, president of Hyatt Corp., who also owns an 865-acre farm
40 miles northwest of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu briefly inspected the young bull. But he seemed more
intrigued by a 10-ton Caterpillar combine parked nearby. To the
consternation of the Secret Service officers surrounding him, he
climbed the steep stairs to enter its cab and peppered the operator
with questions about details _ like the capacity of its hopper, its
horsepower and its cost ($250,000).
</P>
<P>
   He also continued his energetic politicking for China to be
accepted by the World Trade Organization. China failed, at least
temporarily, to win entry, when talks on admission fell through
last week.
</P>
<P>
   While most of his delegation remained inside their buses and
limousines to escape bitter winds, Zhu courted local farmers
gathered on the farm. He urged them to call President Clinton
personally and relate how much they want China to join the world
trade body.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us to call the president directly and tell him how
much we want this WTO thing,'' said Pete Tekampe, 57, who grows
corn and beans on a 1,000-acres nearby. ``I don't know if I can do
that for him, but maybe I'll call my local representative.''

DODGERS' DRY REIGN ALL WASHED UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When he was traded from the New York Mets to the
Dodgers last December, Todd Hundley figured his days of seeing
games rained out at home were over.
</P>
<P>
   Think again, Todd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible,'' Hundley said after the Dodgers-Rockies game
was rained out Sunday. ``I've never seen it rain in L.A. until
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has seen a Dodgers home game postponed because of rain
since April 1988, when three consecutive games against the Padres
were washed out. Their streak of 856 home games without a rainout _
the longest in the majors _ ended at 2:45 p.m., when the official
word came down.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's game, which started about an hour late because
of rain, turned out to be an omen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking forward to playing today,'' Hundley said.
``There's good things and bad things. Some guys get the days off
and get to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers left for Phoenix on Sunday night to start a
three-game series tonight against the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are 5-1 and in second place in the NL West. As a
team, they are hitting almost 100 points (.297 to .202) above their
opponents, and the staff ERA is 3.32.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers already have 10 homers and 10 stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of good things happened this homestand,'' said Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson. ``We continued our good play (from spring
training). We didn't need (a rainout), but we'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Non-issue: Johnson discounted any possibility of bad blood from
the Dodgers' last series against the Diamondbacks carrying over to
these games.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, Dodgers starter Chan Ho Park, who is starting
tonight, threw a pitch that went behind Arizona's Matt Williams.
Williams, who once publicly declared his distaste for the Dodgers
and then-L.A. pitcher Orel Hershiser, yelled at Park and both
benches cleared. There was some shoving between a few players but
no punching.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks starter Todd Stottlemyre expressed regret the next
day for not retaliating. Stottlemyre threw Sunday against the
Braves and won't pitch in this series.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Devon White, who played for the Diamondbacks last
year, said he's not sure what to expect from the Arizona pitchers,
and he doesn't care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't let something like that interfere,'' White said. ``We
can't worry about what (manager) Buck (Showalter) and his crew are
going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bumped: Johnson said the rest of the starters will be bumped
back a day, meaning a rematch between Kevin Brown and Randy Johnson
from opening day won't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (1-0) was scheduled to pitch Thursday in the series
finale. Instead, he will pitch the opener at San Diego on Friday.
Ismael Valdes, who was supposed to start tonight, moves to Tuesday.
Carlos Perez will start Wednesday and Darren Dreifort will face
Johnson on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   History repeating?: The Dodgers' hot start, coupled with their
21 victories in spring training, has followers of the team drawing
parallels to 1988, the year the Dodgers won the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's rainout, the first since that season, drew another
comparison. White said Dodgers coach John Shelby, a member of that
world-champion team, mentioned the coincidence in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's (begin ital)deja vu(end ital) territory,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   There's also one element that seemed to propel the '88 team that
also is catching on as a buzzword on this club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chemistry,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   Closing in: Johnson, who has the highest winning percentage of
all active managers, is 10 wins away from 1,000 in his career. He's
also nine behind Colorado's Jim Leyland and is 46th on the all-time
managerial list for wins.
</P>
<P>
   Patience means success: Raul Mondesi, who has four homers, 10
RBI and a .381 average, has been more selective at the plate and it
is paying off.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, who is batting fourth, walked twice Saturday, giving
him at least one walk in four consecutive games for only the second
time in his six-year career.

WYNN'S ART COLLECTION IS A WINNER, BUT THE PROPOSED TAX BREAK DRAWS
CRITICS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Like braving the Batman ride at Six Flags Great
Adventure or eating at the Hard Rock Cafe in its first heady
months, visiting the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art means enduring an
almost stunning wait.
</P>
<P>
   The line to enter the gallery, the latest attraction in this
vast casino, never seems to disappear. There is a line when the
ticket booth opens at 9 a.m. and there is still one when it closes
at midnight. High noon has to be the worst. On Friday at noon, the
wait for tickets was 40 minutes, and that was to enter the gallery
at 3:30. On Saturday, the wait at noon was nearly an hour, and that
was to get in at 5:50. People were even waiting to wait. In front
of the spectacular array of spring flowers in the hotel's
conservatory, potential patrons milled about the gallery line,
debating whether it would be better to wait then, or later, or
another day.
</P>
<P>
   So it seems that the gamble by the Bellagio's owner, Steven
Wynn, is paying off in spades: the same crowd that clamors for
Siegfried and Roy is also attracted to a $300 million collection of
Van Goghs, Picassos and Monets. This even though it costs more _
$12 _ to enter the two-room gallery than it does New York's
Metropolitan Museum of Art or Museum of Modern Art or just about
any other major art museum in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wynn is hedging his bets. He is lobbying the Nevada
Legislature to pass a bill granting tax exemptions on the
collection that would amount to a one-time sales-tax break of $18
million on the purchase of the art and $2.7 million each year in
property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   This rankles State Sen. Joe Neal, a Democrat from North Las
Vegas who is considered one of the most vocal critics of the casino
industry. ``There's a lot of people who think the casinos get too
many breaks as it is,'' he said. ``Why are we going to go and give
Wynn another one?''
</P>
<P>
   But odds are that the bill, which may be voted on this week,
will pass. While Nevada is cash-strapped, casinos are its
number-one industry and Wynn, chairman of Mirage Resorts Inc., is
the industry ace. This is the man, after all, who persuaded local
lawmakers to approve a nine-acre lake in front of the Bellagio
despite an ordinance banning new artificial lakes in water-starved
Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   This tax battle is one that Wynn has fought before, to a
frustrating end. Well before the October opening of the $1.5
billion Bellagio _ his effort give some snob appeal to the kitschy
theme-park world of the casino strip _ Wynn lobbied for a bill that
would exempt art collectors from property and sales tax on art
worth more than $25,000 if they publicly displayed their art 20
hours a week for 35 weeks a year. The bill, which critics said Wynn
practically wrote himself, was passed by the 1997 Legislature, but
because it charges admission to its gallery, the Bellagio was
denied the property tax exemptions by the state tax commission.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Whittemore, a lobbyist for Mirage Resorts, said Wynn was
not trying to wriggle out of paying taxes on the Bellagio
collection. The collection, which includes works owned personally
by Wynn (which he leases to the hotel) and others owned by his
corporation, is classified as inventory because the works in it are
for sale. As such, Whittemore said, it would already be exempt from
sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   The interest in passing the law is altruism, Whittemore said: so
that those who buy art will want to show it for the property tax
breaks they will get. ``You're trying to encourage the public
display of art.''
</P>
<P>
   In December Wynn sued the tax commission on the ground that it
had never mentioned that public displays must be free. The lawsuit
would become moot if the bill passes. The legislation says
galleries that charge admission can still claim exemptions if they
donate their profits to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn offered to halve the gallery admission for residents of
Nevada and to let schoolchildren in free during a 20-day per year
art appreciation program if the bill passed. The bill passed the
Senate Taxation Committee last week, 6 to 1, with only Neal voting
against it. His competing bill, to repeal art tax exemptions, died
a quick death.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike McGinness, a Republican from Fallon who wrote the
current bill, said that the Bellagio gallery would more than make
up for the taxes lost by luring tourists to the state. ``It's
already a major attraction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This cannot be denied. But Neal, who is getting a reputation for
fencing with windmills _ he recently also proposed bills that would
ban campaign contributions from the casino industry and raise the
industry's taxes _ is not impressed.
</P>
<P>
   People in Nevada, he said, just hate laws tailor-made to benefit
the casinos. ``How many other people do you think can buy a piece
of art for at least $25,000 and put it on public display?''

OLAZABAL COMPLETES COMEBACK FROM INJURY TO WIN MASTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Three years ago, Jose Maria Olazabal suffered
through days when he couldn't walk, crippled by intense pain in his
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Olazabal walked away with the sweetest victory of his
career, his second triumph at the Masters to go with the one in
1994 and a victory that amplified his talent and courage.
</P>
<P>
   He was not the sentimental favorite _ Greg Norman was. Olazabal
started shakily, making three consecutive bogeys on the front nine,
and losing the one-stroke lead he held when the day started.
</P>
<P>
   But on the back nine at Augusta National Golf Club, where so
many golfers have created memorable moments, Olazabal was truly
masterful. He made a terrific 10-foot putt for birdie at No. 10 to
tie Norman for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   After Norman made a sensational 25-foot eagle putt at No. 13,
sending a roar through the gallery that shook the azaleas, Olazabal
answered his playing partner boldly, making a 22-foot putt for
birdie that kept Norman and Olazabal tied.
</P>
<P>
   After Norman bogeyed No. 15 to give Olazabal the lead for good,
Olazabal made another spectacular birdie at the 170-yard, par-3
16th, hitting a 6-iron tee shot that landed three feet from the
cup, followed by the putt for birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after reaching the 17th green with a two-stroke lead,
Olazabal put the exclamation point on his victory with a crucial
par save at No. 17, hitting a gorgeous 5-iron from the rough that
rolled through the fairway and reached the green. Minutes later,
Olazabal made a nerve-testing seven-foot putt for par, which doomed
both Norman and Davis Love 3rd, and a putt that let everyone know
that this 33-year-old Spaniard had come too far to squander
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a final-round 71, Olazabal finished at 8-under for the
tournament (280). He won by two strokes over Love ( 6-under par,
282) and by three strokes over Norman, who played well but was
denied at the Masters once again.
</P>
<P>
   Many started the day pulling for Norman, the two-time British
Open champion who has finished second three times at Augusta, most
recently in 1996 when he lost a six-stroke lead to Nick Faldo on
the final day. But at the end of the day, there was true joy for
Olazabal, who has recovered from the health problems that
threatened his career to return to the top his profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very satisfying, and it's very difficult to express how I
feel,'' said Olazabal, who cried tears of joy at one point during
his post-tournament press conference. ``I'm very proud of myself,
not just for myself, but for all the other people who supported me
through bad times, my family, my friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was at my lowest, I never thought about this happening
again. I thought I would never play golf again. To me to be right
here, with another green jacket, is an achievement that I didn't
even dream about.''
</P>
<P>
   What Olazabal did Sunday was no dream, and though he lost at the
Masters again, Norman insisted that this was not another nightmare.
There could be only one winner, and while Norman wanted that winner
to be him, he also felt joy for Olazabal, who became a close friend
years ago when they played together in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a heartbreak,'' said Norman, who also shot 71, and
who held the lead ever so briefly before Olazabal answered Norman's
eagle at No. 13 with a birdie. ``It's a successful event, and
sadness involved too. But look at that leader board. There's a lot
of other guys who can sit here and say they're heartbroken too.''
</P>
<P>
   Count Love among them, who has finished in the top seven four
times in the last five Masters, including two second-place
finishes. Love made the most spectacular shot of the tournament, a
chip shot for birdie at No. 16 that floated softly onto the
severely sloping green, then took a 180-degree turn and rolled
slowly down the hill about 25 feet until it settled into the cup.
The gallery exploded as the ball disappeared, and Love raised his
arms in triumph, knowing it was the kind of miracle shot that can
make champions.
</P>
<P>
   But Love was still one stroke behind Olazabal, and after
Olazabal's birdie at No. 16, Love could only make par at both No.
17 and No. 18, and he knew another chance at Augusta had been lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' said Love. ``I left a lot of shots out
there, but I'm pleased that I had a chance to get nervous on the
weekend. But I'm happy for Jose. A few years back, we had heard
that might not play anymore. To come back from something like to
win the Masters again is really something, and I know how much he
loves this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal's health problems began in 1995, when he began to
experience pain in his feet, caused by a nerve problem in his back
that was not detected for more than a year. Until the cause of
Olazabal's pain was discovered, he suffered, missing the 1996
Masters because he was in no condition to play.
</P>
<P>
   Watching that tournament at home, and watching Norman's
tribulations that year was a doubly painful experience for
Olazabal, but Sunday, he was back where he belonged, making great
shots on a golf course.
</P>
<P>
   So many people started the day with a chance to win, like Bob
Estes and Steve Pate, who finished tied for fourth place at 4-under
par, as well as David Duval (3-under) and Lee Westwood (3-under),
both of whom made final-day charges and reached five under par at
one point.
</P>
<P>
   But it finally came down to a three-player race, and Olazabal
proved his worth, and his class. After the 13th hole, Norman and
Olazabal pointed at each other, a sign of respect after great
putts.
</P>
<P>
   Then as Olazabal prepared to walk up the 18th fairway, he waited
for Norman, and the too walked up the together as the gallery
cheered. Finally Olazabal, made the final putt to win, and his long
journey back to the top at Augusta was over.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a long, painful road back. But the end was sweet.
``The first time I won here, I didn't have the knowledge or the
time to really enjoy,'' said Olazabal. ``This one, I'm really going
to enjoy much more.''  &QL;

RODMAN SHOWS UP AND PLAYS WELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ In the unpredictable tug-of-war between the yin and
yang of Dennis Rodman's world, sometimes it takes a couple of days
for the good and the bad to achieve a happy balance. But the scales
evened again Sunday, as they usually, eventually do.
</P>
<P>
   First, he showed up. Then he resumed his role as a starter, as
if the ill behavior of the previous two days was wholly irrelevant.
And then Rodman played as if it indeed had been.
</P>
<P>
   Playing 40 minutes against the Sonics, Rodman grabbed 13
rebounds and added six points, two steals, an assist and a blocked
shot. Other than a technical foul, hardly a surprise, Rodman's
behavior was impeccable.
</P>
<P>
   So who cares if he refused to re-enter the fourth quarter Friday
or come to practice Saturday? Not his Laker teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of just went like this, right over the top of our
heads,'' Kobe Bryant said, passing his hand over his Afro. ``We had
a game to get ready for.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no airing out of issues between Rodman and teammates
or Rodman and coach Kurt Rambis, and when the coach was asked what
Lakers management's response was to recent events, the answer, he
said, was a nonplussed, ``Oh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis comes to play every night,'' Shaquille O'Neal said.
``We think you guys (reporters) make more of a big deal of it than
we do. . . . We don't let it bother us. . . . It's really not
(Rodman) that needs practice time. There's a lot of other guys on
this team that need practice time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman did not address reporters, but in comments provided by
the Lakers, he said: ``I am taking most of the heat right now (for
the team's struggles), just because. . . . But I am used to it, so
it really does not bother me. Probably most of the blame will fall
on me no matter what I do, so I do not care if they blame me or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie maneuvers: Glen Rice was home with a sore throat and a
fever, and Rambis decided not to mess with his bench rotation, so
rookie Ruben Patterson got his first career start Sunday, and the
challenge of a lifetime _ guarding Gary Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson played 11 minutes and survived the attack, using three
fouls and all the defense he had to limit Payton to a layup and two
free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I did a good job against him today. He didn't do
nothing to me,'' Patterson said. ``He's a good player, he talks a
lot of trash, but I wasn't listening.''
</P>
<P>
   Fan favorite Tyronn Lue played 15 minutes at point guard and the
rookie again impressed, scoring 10 points on 4-of-5 shooting,
including a pair of 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   The last word: Olden Polynice was a minor factor in the Sonics'
victory (four points, eight rebounds), but that didn't stop him
from providing the best smack talk of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Last time these teams met, O'Neal derided Polynice, saying,
``I'm the bridge, Olden is water. . . . He'll always be under me.''
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Polynice responded: ``You can tell Shaq I might
still be water and he's the bridge, but guess what, the bridge was
man-made and the water is made by God. I will always survive. And
he better watch out before I rise over him. I don't care what he
says, he's still going to be Shaquille and I'll still be The Man.''

FEWER BOMBS FALL, AS NEW ATROCITIES ARE ALLEGED  (jw) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO held back from intensive bombing on a
day of cloudy weather over Kosovo Sunday, hampering its attacks
even as alliance officials accused the Serbs of carrying out new
atrocities against ethnic Albanians in their southern province.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said the alliance had ordered a
``night of relative restraint'' for the Orthodox Easter
celebration, but military commanders referred only to the weather
as the reason.
</P>
<P>
   No successful attacks were reported between Saturday night and
Sunday morning against Serbian forces or tanks operating in Kosovo.
Attacks resumed with renewed vigor on Sunday night, however.
</P>
<P>
   The slowdown in the NATO campaign came as alliance officials
Sunday released aerial photographs, including one of freshly turned
earth, that they said could be mass graves, and another of clusters
of people described as ethnic Albanians driven from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Officials stressed that the photographs, taken on Friday, could
not be confirmed as graves until they could be examined on the
ground, but they said the first image resembled aerial photographs
of graves taken in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   One aerial photograph, which officials said was taken over Pusto
Selo, near Orahovac, showed what appeared to be two long parallel
lines of mounds in a clearing off a road with buildings scattered
nearby and tracks in the ground that could have been left by
military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The freshly turned earth could indicate possible mass
graves,'' a spokesman for the allied military command, Col. Konrad
Freytag, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph, if what it appears to show can be verified,
would buttress refugees' accounts of atrocities, which have been
impossible to verify since the journalists and foreign observers
were expelled or evacuated from Kosovo last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are simply indicating something from the air that could be
a mass grave,'' Shea said, ``and based on our experience in Bosnia,
of course, a number of mass graves were identified and recovered
and from the air, the form looks something similar, and that's the
reason why we've shown you these photographs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a mass grave, but obviously it will be up to the
international tribunal in The Hague, once it's able to go into
Kosovo, to conduct a thorough investigation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Freytag said the allies had flown reconnaissance missions over
the area around Orahovac, halfway between the Kosovo provincial
capital of Pristina and the Albanian border, after receiving
intelligence reports that Serb military and paramilitary police
units had committed atrocities against civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Other aerial photographs released by the command, also taken on
Friday, showed what officials said were internally displaced
persons near Malisevo.
</P>
<P>
   The reconnaissance effort apparently came in response to
complaints by some allied civilian representatives here that the
military had not tried hard enough to learn what had happened to
tens of thousands of fleeing ethnic Albanian civilians who vanished
overnight last week after Serbian border guards turned them back at
the frontier with Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs were all made from a high altitude. Clouds and
rain over the area since then had made it impossible to follow up
since, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The weather also hampered alliance attacks. Clouds ranging in
altitude from 2,000 to 8,000 feet shrouded most of Serbia over the
weekend. The F-117 stealth fighter typically flies missions between
15,000 and 25,000 feet, out of range of anti-aircraft fire.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs showed what appeared to be vehicles scattered
along a road and crowds of people in temporary shelters in fields
or scrub land near a destroyed village, which the command did not
identify.
</P>
<P>
   ``They lack the basic elements of relief and are particularly
short of food,'' British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Sunday
in London, referring to the internal refugees. ``The weather
currently is against them. It is snowing Sunday in western
Kosovo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the alliance could do to help the people believed to
be hiding in the forests and mountains around the province _
400,000 of them by Cook's estimate _ Shea said Sunday, ``The best
thing NATO can do for internally displaced persons is to drive away
the Serbian forces that are attacking them.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior allied diplomat said, ``Air drops, if we could identify
where people are, could be a way of dealing with this, if we aren't
just feeding the Serbs.'' NATO planes would have to fly at high
altitude to avoid Serb anti-aircraft fire from the ground, but that
would mean an increased chance that the food and supplies they
dropped could fall into the hands of Serbian forces instead of the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But the refugees are probably moving about on the ground, and
with unfavorable weather conditions expected to last through
Wednesday, allied intelligence is apparently finding it difficult
to keep information up to date.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian Orthodox Christian calendar marked Sunday as Easter,
but allied military authorities had adamantly rejected calls from
the Vatican and from Russian Orthodox leaders in Moscow for a pause
in the bombing to cover the entire 10-day Easter holiday period
that began with Good Friday observances for Western Christians on
April 2.
</P>
<P>
   Among the allies, both Greece and Italy had sought political
support for such a pause but did not press when military commanders
responded that a break in the bombing would just give Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic that much more time to push many of
Kosovo's 1.8 million ethnic Albanians from their homes.

RECORD COMPANIES ARE WARY OF NEW MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Microsoft Corp. is expected on Tuesday to enter
the battle to deliver music to consumers who download the files
through the Internet, according to people close to the company.
</P>
<P>
   At the House of Blues here, Microsoft is expected to introduce a
technology called MS Audio 4.0, the latest contender trying to
replace the MP3 file format, the system of digital compression that
lets music fans convert songs and other audio into computer files
quickly and without restrictions. The Microsoft product is faster
and more powerful than MP3 and has built-in safeguards to deter
unauthorized copying.
</P>
<P>
   Large record companies have been loath to make music available
as MP3 files because they fear unrestricted bootlegging on the
Internet. But, much to Microsoft's surprise, they seem no more
likely to comply with the software giant's alternative. There are
several reasons, according to record executives: They do not like
the way Microsoft has tried to deal with them on MS Audio 4.0. They
are worried that the security system will not meet their needs.
They do not like the fact that the Windows Media Player can play
MP3 files, and, more to the point, they just do not want Microsoft
in their business.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft announcement comes as major labels are four months
into their own response to MP3, the Secure Digital Music
Initiative, which intends to create a set of standards for
delivering copyright-protected music over the Internet and put them
into effect by the holiday season. One factor upsetting record
companies, according to executives, is that Microsoft has not said
that it will comply with the initiative's standards once they are
announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record companies are shutting it down completely,'' said a
representative for one major-label act who was contacted by
Microsoft and spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``And the reason
they aren't cooperating makes sense: Microsoft is saying SDMI won't
work. Talk about cynicism and arrogance.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives and representatives for all five major recording
companies were contacted, and none would speak on the record about
MS Audio 4.0. Although a few songs by major labels were originally
set to be made available as MS Audio 4.0 files, at the last minute
even those labels backed out of the project. One reason, an
executive said, was a letter sent out by Microsoft, perceived as
desperate, which set a deadline of Tuesday for record labels to
comply with the new audio format.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft declined to confirm the existence of such a letter or
respond to any comments because they assume the existence of a
technology that the company has not yet announced. It is
Microsoft's policy not to discuss any development before its
official introduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it hadn't been Microsoft _ if it was company X doing this _
it would be warmly embraced,'' said Dave Goldberg, the chief
executive of Launch, which is working with Microsoft to make MS
Audio 4.0 music available on its Launch.com Web site on Tuesday.
``I don't think Microsoft realized this at first. They thought they
had a good solution for consumers and record labels. The people who
do Internet stuff at the record companies were very excited by
this, but the people higher up were frightened by the strategic
implications.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   MS Audio 4.0 is said to be twice as fast to download and upload
as MP3, and it is half the file size. Yet its audio quality is said
to be slightly better than that of MP3, which sounds nearly as good
as a compact disk. To use MS Audio 4.0, Windows users must download
a free, updated version of the Windows Media Player from Microsoft.
Though it is not expected to be announced on Tuesday, Microsoft,
which recently invested $1.5 million in a digital rights-management
company called Reciprocal, has also been working on an encryption
system called Secure Audio Streaming Format that will be built into
Windows 2000. SecureASFdd copy, as it is known, is said to prevent
users from playing unauthorized audio files.
</P>
<P>
   Though major labels have been avoiding Microsoft, the
independent labels have been more cooperative. They have always
existed below the dominating music powers and are glad for any
marketing muscle a company like Microsoft can provide.

<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Like braving the Batman ride at Six Flags Great
Adventure or eating at the Hard Rock Cafe in its first heady
months, visiting the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art means enduring an
almost stunning wait.
</P>
<P>
   The line to enter the gallery, the latest attraction in this
vast casino, never seems to disappear. There is a line when the
ticket booth opens at 9 a.m. and there is still one when it closes
at midnight. High noon has to be the worst. On Friday at noon, the
wait for tickets was 40 minutes, and that was to enter the gallery
at 3:30. On Saturday, the wait at noon was nearly an hour, and that
was to get in at 5:50. People were even waiting to wait. In front
of the spectacular array of spring flowers in the hotel's
conservatory, potential patrons milled about the gallery line,
debating whether it would be better to wait then, or later, or
another day.
</P>
<P>
   So it seems that the gamble by the Bellagio's owner, Steven
Wynn, is paying off in spades: the same crowd that clamors for
Siegfried and Roy is also attracted to a $300 million collection of
Van Goghs, Picassos and Monets. This even though it costs more _
$12 _ to enter the two-room gallery than it does New York's
Metropolitan Museum of Art or Museum of Modern Art or just about
any other major art museum in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wynn is hedging his bets. He is lobbying the Nevada
Legislature to pass a bill granting tax exemptions on the
collection that would amount to a one-time sales-tax break of $18
million on the purchase of the art and $2.7 million each year in
property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   This rankles State Sen. Joe Neal, a Democrat from North Las
Vegas who is considered one of the most vocal critics of the casino
industry. ``There's a lot of people who think the casinos get too
many breaks as it is,'' he said. ``Why are we going to go and give
Wynn another one?''
</P>
<P>
   But odds are that the bill, which may be voted on this week,
will pass. While Nevada is cash-strapped, casinos are its
number-one industry and Wynn, chairman of Mirage Resorts Inc., is
the industry ace. This is the man, after all, who persuaded local
lawmakers to approve a nine-acre lake in front of the Bellagio
despite an ordinance banning new artificial lakes in water-starved
Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   This tax battle is one that Wynn has fought before, to a
frustrating end. Well before the October opening of the $1.5
billion Bellagio _ his effort give some snob appeal to the kitschy
theme-park world of the casino strip _ Wynn lobbied for a bill that
would exempt art collectors from property and sales tax on art
worth more than $25,000 if they publicly displayed their art 20
hours a week for 35 weeks a year. The bill, which critics said Wynn
practically wrote himself, was passed by the 1997 Legislature, but
because it charges admission to its gallery, the Bellagio was
denied the property tax exemptions by the state tax commission.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Whittemore, a lobbyist for Mirage Resorts, said Wynn was
not trying to wriggle out of paying taxes on the Bellagio
collection. The collection, which includes works owned personally
by Wynn (which he leases to the hotel) and others owned by his
corporation, is classified as inventory because the works in it are
for sale. As such, Whittemore said, it would already be exempt from
sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   The interest in passing the law is altruism, Whittemore said: so
that those who buy art will want to show it for the property tax
breaks they will get. ``You're trying to encourage the public
display of art.''
</P>
<P>
   In December Wynn sued the tax commission on the ground that it
had never mentioned that public displays must be free. The lawsuit
would become moot if the bill passes. The legislation says
galleries that charge admission can still claim exemptions if they
donate their profits to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn offered to halve the gallery admission for residents of
Nevada and to let schoolchildren in free during a 20-day per year
art appreciation program if the bill passed. The bill passed the
Senate Taxation Committee last week, 6 to 1, with only Neal voting
against it. His competing bill, to repeal art tax exemptions, died
a quick death.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike McGinness, a Republican from Fallon who wrote the
current bill, said that the Bellagio gallery would more than make
up for the taxes lost by luring tourists to the state. ``It's
already a major attraction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This cannot be denied. But Neal, who is getting a reputation for
fencing with windmills _ he recently also proposed bills that would
ban campaign contributions from the casino industry and raise the
industry's taxes _ is not impressed.
</P>
<P>
   People in Nevada, he said, just hate laws tailor-made to benefit
the casinos. ``How many other people do you think can buy a piece
of art for at least $25,000 and put it on public display?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   John M. Reznikoff remembers an August day two years ago, when he
sat with his family on a beach on Cape Cod and felt on top of the
world. He had established himself as a respected dealer in stamps,
coins and other collectibles, even locks of hair from famous
people. But he was best known for his vast collection of autographs
of noted figures, tens of thousands of them, including every
president, from Washington to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It was no easy feat, especially in a business so quirky and
insular, where a person's word and trust mean everything. But just
a week later, Reznikoff's world came apart, undone by allegations
of fraud, betrayal and a shattered friendship. His reputation was
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   It all turned on hundreds of documents, supposedly handwritten
by John F. Kennedy, that he was helping a close friend sell.
Reznikoff recalls that the friend, who had already sold 200 of the
documents to more than 100 investors for several million dollars,
tearfully confessed to him that all the papers were fakes, forged
by him. Reznikoff said he soon came to see that his friend's life
had been full of deceit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to describe the feeling,'' Reznikoff said. ``You
work on something, and everything's rosy for four or five years,
and then it's like somebody punches you in the stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   The friend, Lawrence X. Cusack II, recanted his story the next
day, Reznikoff said, but the seed of doubt had been planted. On his
lawyer's advice, Reznikoff secretly taped a conversation with
Cusack. He gave the tape to the U.S. attorney's office in
Manhattan, hoping to clear his own name and helping to bolster the
criminal case against Cusack, whose trial on fraud charges begins
Monday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, government prosecutors say ``the evidence is
overwhelming'' that the documents are forgeries and that Cusack
``is the person responsible.'' The most explosive of the papers
purports to detail an affair between Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe,
and Kennedy's agreement to pay hush money to the actress to remain
silent about their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Cusack has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and has maintained
in numerous interviews that the papers are genuine.
</P>
<P>
   In a hearing on Friday, Judge Denise L. Cote signaled that she
expected that Cusack would try ``to rebut any implication that he
forged or even knew of any forgeries.'' Neither Cusack's lawyer,
Robert F. Katzberg, nor officials with the the U.S. attorney's
office would comment about the impending trial.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the jury weighs Cusack's guilt or innocence, the
central drama of the trial may be Cusack's relationship with
Reznikoff, who is expected to be the government's chief witness and
whose tape will offer some of the government's most crucial
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The tape transcript, a draft of which has been filed in public
court records, shows Cusack as a conflicted and distraught man,
admitting that he had misled friends, associates _ even his wife _
and had given people the false impression that he had served in the
Navy in Vietnam and had graduated from Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   He seems unable to extract himself from the web of lies. ``It's
sort of like, how and when do you 'fess up?'' Cusack says at one
point, adding, ``How am I going to explain that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You start covering for yourself,'' he explains later, adding,
``It's like a self-perpetuating lie that you can't get away from.''
He ultimately decided, he said, to let the lies be his ``cover
story'' and ``let it sit.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he concedes, ``It just got out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Cote has allowed most of the tape to be admitted into the trial,
over the objections of Cusack's lawyer, Katzberg, who contends that
some aspects could prejudice the jury. It is also not clear from
court records how Cusack views the taped conversation, or how
Katzberg will portray it to the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Reznikoff's lawyer, Russell M. Gioiella, said he advised his
client to make the tape because he saw no other way for Reznikoff
to prove his own innocence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a recent interview at Gioiella's office in lower Manhattan,
Reznikoff discussed his relationship with Cusack, although he
avoided talking about some aspects of his conversations with Cusack
because they might be used at trial.
</P>
<P>
   He said he first met Cusack in 1992, when he bought some stamps
from him, and grew to like him. ``I was impressed with how he
carried himself, the way he talked,'' he recalled. They socialized
together; their wives became friends. Reznikoff called him ``a very
close friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in 1993, Cusack first showed Reznikoff copies of the
Kennedy papers, the government has said in court papers. Cusack had
said that he had found them in the office of his late father,
Lawrence X. Cusack Jr., a prominent lawyer who had represented the
Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Reznikoff said he saw no reason to disbelieve Cusack or to
suspect any bad faith on his part, and he helped him obtain letters
of authentication from handwriting experts for every document that
was eventually sold.
</P>
<P>
   At some point in 1994 or 1995, the government says in court
papers, Cusack invited Reznikoff to attend a ceremony at the U.S.
Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md., where one of Cusack's relatives
was a plebe.
</P>
<P>
   As a federal prosecutor, Paul A. Engelmayer, described the event
in court papers: ``To buttress his false claim of Navy service,
Cusack on that occasion wore the full dress-white uniform of a
lieutenant commander, with a chest full of medals, including the
Naval Cross, and as a result, received salutes from thousands of
midshipmen.''
</P>
<P>
   Reznikoff says he was impressed by his friend. ``One of the
things that was most endearing about him,'' he said in the
interview, ``was his military background. I'm a patriot. I have an
intense appreciation of patriotism.''
</P>
<P>
   After questions were raised in August 1997 about the papers'
authenticity, Reznikoff returned from a vacation in Truro, Mass.,
to his office in Stamford, Conn., and met with Cusack on Aug. 25.
</P>
<P>
   `` Cusack broke down, cried and stated that he had been
praying,'' the government said in a federal complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Reznikoff asked Cusack whether the documents were forged.
``Cusack responded by asking whether they could just give the
purchasers their money back,'' the complaint says.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, ``Reznikoff asked Cusack if he had forged all of the
documents, and Cusack said yes,'' the government said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon thereafter, Cusack called Reznikoff and took it all back,
the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Reznikoff said that for weeks he was utterly confused about
where the truth lay, and in October consulted with a lawyer,
Gioiella.
</P>
<P>
   Gioiella advised him to protect himself, and to meet again with
Cusack, with a tape recorder running.
</P>
<P>
   Reznikoff said he resisted this plan, hesitant to betray a
friend. He said he finally agreed for his family's sake, fearing
that he would be dragged into the government's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In the secretly taped session on Oct. 18, Reznikoff recounted
for Cusack their earlier conversation, and he recalled how Cusack
had sat there holding his head, crying and admitting that he had
forged the papers, the transcript shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're sitting there and you're telling me that you're guilty,
that you did everything, that everything's fake,'' Reznikoff says,
according to the transcript.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm listening to you,'' Cusack replies.
</P>
<P>
   In the transcript, which runs 30 pages, Cusack is shown
equivocating and shifting ground, while still maintaining that the
papers are genuine. But he does not deny Reznikoff's version of his
earlier confession. Nor does he suggest that Reznikoff had a role
in any forgery scheme. The government has said in legal papers that
the tape shows that Reznikoff ``had not been aware of the
forgery.''
</P>
<P>
   The transcript also shows Cusack admitting that he did not serve
in the Navy. Reznikoff asks why Cusack misled him, reminding him of
their trip to Annapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw you wearing that uniform and I saw 3,000 people saluting
you,'' Reznikoff says, adding: ``I believed all along from Day One
that you had this unbelievable military career. And I loved that
about you.''
</P>
<P>
   Reznikoff adds, ``I need an explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   Cusack says it began as a joke among friends years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``But why would you let your friend, supposed friend, believe
that?'' Reznikoff asks. ``Why would you let me believe? Why would
you let me have that faith in your military career?''
</P>
<P>
   That was when Cusack said he did not know how to `` 'fess up,''
that it had all got out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Reznikoff said he now wonders how much of their friendship
itself was genuine. If the government's allegations are borne out
at trial, he said, then Cusack was involved in the forgery scheme
as early as 1993 _ shortly after the two men met.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very generous to me throughout those years and to my
family,'' Reznikoff said. ``If everything that's alleged is true, I
almost feel more sorry for him than I feel angry.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he hopes he was not manipulated. ``I like to think that
some of the friendship was real,'' he said, ``and I think I am a
good friend, someone who's fun to be with, and that I do add to a
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``But who knows? I don't know what the ultimate answer
to that question is. A lot will be revealed in the weeks to come.''

CAMBY COMES ON STRONG AS KNICKS TOP NETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., _ Marcus Camby has had to build a trust
with New York Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy layer by layer.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't come easy. But each time he performs with an edge,
each time he refuses to back down, Camby inches a little closer to
Van Gundy's inner circle of players he can count on.
</P>
<P>
   Camby made a huge gain on that realm Sunday by putting a hand up
in the face of the New Jersey Nets' momentum during the second
quarter when he scored 13 of his 19 points to help the Knicks win
their second game in a row, 93-78, at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Camby finish his shots on the fast break and use a
fancy drop-step for a layup, he flustered the Nets' star threat,
Keith Van Horn, and held him to 3-of-14 shooting by using his
windmill-like arms to alter Van Horn's jumpers, runners and layups.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is still a debate as to whether Camby is physical
enough to withstand the likes of Orlando, Miami and Indiana, this
was the kind of game that goes a long way with Van Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to go out and hope that Jeff has enough
confidence in me to play me against Miami and Indiana,'' said
Camby, who also had eight rebounds and one blocked shot against the
Nets. ``I've been doing everything he has asked of me. I've just
been waiting for my turn to get minutes. I wasn't discouraged about
the lack of playing time.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby has been used selectively this year. He has put up
impressive numbers against teams like Boston (15 rebounds) and
Chicago (eight blocks), but when faced with Orlando, Miami and
Indiana, he has averaged 7.8 minutes and 1.8 rebounds a game and is
2 of 8 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Often labeled as too frail and weak, Camby made strides in
changing that image last week. After missing three games with a
strained groin, Camby played with pain against Atlanta on Friday
and shot 4 for 6 and had five rebounds in 19 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he punched another hole in his soft image. Irritated by
a foul, Camby slipped the notice of the officials as he sent a
forearm into the shoulder of Jamie Feick. Although Feick barely
felt the blow from the slender Camby, it was a snapshot of
aggression rarely associated with Camby.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, Camby is linked with his failure to be like
the rugged Charles Oakley. Camby is usually stuck being compared
with the folk hero he replaced, even though he is more of a finesse
player and Oakley is more of a bully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough at the beginning, because of all the talk about
me and Oak,'' Camby said. ``But I just want to go out and be
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby's game hasn't always fit Van Gundy's plans. That did not
always sit well with the team president, Ernie Grunfeld, who signed
Camby to a six-year, $48 million contract extension despite his
limited playing time. There has been tension caused by how big a
role Camby should play. For his part, Camby has stayed out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, coming in, Marcus had some big shoes to fill,''
Larry Johnson said. ``But he's doing an excellent job. He's been
the difference in our last two games. He's done a good job handling
the minutes he is getting and the ones he's not. He's waiting for
his turn and not pouting in the newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby did the job in his matchup with Van Horn. During the Nets'
surge of having won five of six games entering Sunday, Van Horn had
averaged 27 points a game. Along with Kurt Thomas, Camby held Van
Horn to 10 points. Adding a little offensive flair, Camby played a
large part in dampening the Nets' recent good mood.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson helped as well. He scored a game-high 22 points by
barging his way around the Nets' soft interior defense, and helped
give the Knicks a 44-16 edge on points in the paint.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the pressure off Patrick Ewing, who was 6 of 17 for 15
points, the Knicks worked the ball around and played with the
unselfish style that has been lacking at times during a year of ups
and downs. Chris Childs delivered six assists as a part of a sleek
second unit that featured Camby flashing his potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if Marcus has made improvements because of
confidence, feeling more comfortable or just getting an opportunity
to play, but he's playing well,'' Van Gundy said. ``I thought the
matchup with Van Horn was perfect for him. He's continuing to make
the most of his opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby would like a chance to prove himself. But at no time has
he thought the limit on his playing time had anything to do with
Van Gundy's displeasure with the trade of Oakley for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about that twice,'' Camby said. ``He told me he
wasn't against the trade. All I can do is go by the man's word.''
</P>
<P>
   All Camby can do is continue to build that trust.  &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: SUCCESS AND SADNESS, AND THREE BAD SHOTS
</HEADLINE>
   (See also GLF-MASTERS) 
(rk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ When Greg Norman curled in a 25-foot eagle putt
on the 13th green, he was suddenly 7- under par and leading the
Masters. The roar of all those people down in that corner of
Augusta National almost blew the blossoms off the azalea bushes. He
nodded and tipped his cap.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Jose Maria Olazabal holed a 20-foot birdie putt
to share the lead. Another roar. Norman waved to the Spaniard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the game was on,'' the 44-year-old Australian was
saying now. ``When I made my putt, I never doubted that he'd make
his. But I was trying not to draw off the emotion of the gallery
because it can work against you. I had to walk away so it wouldn't
be too much. And after Ollie made his putt, you just want to go to
the next tee and put it in the fairway.''
</P>
<P>
   But off that next tee, Norman's drive soared to the right,
bounced off a spectator and stopped in ``the second cut,'' alias
the short rough grown at the Masters for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to shoot for the flagstick, Norman skidded a 7-iron over
the green. He chipped short, then two-putted from 15 feet. Bogey.
And when Olazabal made par, he was leading by one.
</P>
<P>
   Off the 15th tee, Norman's drive sailed to the right, stopping
behind the new transplanted pine trees. Unable to go for the green,
he laid up in front of the pond, then squirted a wedge into the
right bunker and blasted out long. When his par-saving putt lipped
out, he had another bogey. And when Olazabal got his par, Norman
had dropped two behind.
</P>
<P>
   With a 71 for 280, Olazabal would win his second Masters, two
strokes ahead of Davis Love 3rd and three ahead of Norman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a successful week and a sad week all rolled up in
one,'' Norman would say later. ``Success from the pure fact of all
my hard work and dedication to get back from shoulder surgery. I
feel like I'm back in the position where I can contend again. And
obviously the sadness of not winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Norman considered it anywhere near as ``heartbreaking''
as his 1996 Masters loss when, with a six-stroke lead after three
rounds, he soared to a 78 as Nick Faldo shot 67 to win by five.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heartbreaking? Not at all,'' he said. ``Some people might
interpret it that way, but like I said, it's a successful event
with sadness involved too. It's not a heartbreak. There's probably
a lot of other guys here who can say they're heartbroken too. Don't
make a mountain out of a molehill. I was more disappointed in '96,
and '96 was totally different.''
</P>
<P>
   In that mano-a-mano with Faldo in the final pairing, Norman just
collapsed, early and often. In Sunday's duel with Olazabal in the
final pairing, he snatched the lead momentarily with that eagle
putt on the 13th green before reverting to the Norman who has often
pushed his shots to the right in the crucible of the finishing
holes in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   On the 72nd hole of the 1984 U.S. Open Championships at Winged
Foot, he pushed a 4-iron toward the grandstand near the green. Only
a 50-foot par putt put him in a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, on the second hole of the 18-hole playoff with
Fuzzy Zoeller, Norman pushed his tee shot into the trees. He had a
double-bogey six there as Zoeller, who holed a 60-foot putt, took a
quick three-stroke lead. The playoff was virtually over.
</P>
<P>
   On the 72nd hole of the 1986 Masters, Norman, needing a par to
force a playoff with Jack Nicklaus, pushed a 4-iron to the right of
the green. Bogey. At age 46, Nicklaus won.
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday, Norman pushed three crucial shots _ his drive at the
14th that led to a bogey, his drive at the 15th and the wedge into
the bunker that led to another bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the tee shot at the 14th, I hit it just dead straight,'' he
said. ``On the tee shot at the 15th, I tried to hit a hard smoker,
turn it off the trees, but I caught it a little high on the driver
face and that's why it didn't turn over.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, those two tee shots and the wedge from
only 94 yards that squirted into the bunker cost Norman whatever
chance he had to finally put on a green jacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say that I wasn't tournament tough in rounds one and
two,'' he said, ``but in three and four when you've got yourself
into contention, you'd be surprised how quickly you can get back
into it. That's what you really miss. Even though I've said I
didn't miss the game, you don't miss the game, but you miss these
moments and that's why you play.''
</P>
<P>
   But in those moments, Greg Norman has often pushed his golf ball
at the worst possible time. As he did again Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And when he was asked if he had been beaten by Jose Maria
Olazabal, by Augusta National and its wind gusts, or by himself, he
said, ``I think it's probably a combination of all three.''
</P>
<P>
   As well as those three bad shots.

POTENTIAL PROFITS SEEN IN FAN-ORIENTED WEB SITES 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wait a second. Wasn't entertainment supposed to be a flop on the
Internet?
</P>
<P>
   A lot of companies had high hopes that were dashed with such
entertainment concepts as online soap operas.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking that money may be the answer, Microsoft spent
television-style budgets to develop a series of elaborate online
``shows'' like ``Mungo Park,'' about adventure travel.
</P>
<P>
   The surfers were not amused. And Microsoft, and many others
retreated to focus on more practical Internet services, like e-mail
and shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is now a quiet resurgence of entertainment-based
material on the Internet, and companies that think they can profit
by offering it. Rather than original online programming, though,
the biggest successes are the most derivative: online extensions of
music, television shows and movies that fans already know.
</P>
<P>
   Pursuing the same impulses that made People magazine and its
many imitators so popular, many people want to use the Internet to
get closer to the entertainers they love, reading interviews,
looking at photographs and listening to unreleased record tracks.
Even more powerfully, they want to share their enthusiasm with
other fans, through chat rooms, message boards and even building
home pages about their favorite performers and shows.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, building such content and community around their
recording artists is one of the principal goals of an Internet
venture announced last week by Seagram's Universal Music and
Bertelsmann's BMG, which will sell advertising in addition to
promoting the music companies' recordings. And other entertainment
companies, especially Time Warner's Warner Brothers, are building
fan-oriented sites as independent media profit centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to find ways to get more from our existing
customers,'' said Jim Moloshok, the head of Warner Brothers Online.
``It's no different from McDonald's saying, `Do you want fries with
that hamburger?' ''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This phenomenon has been building from many sides. Many of the
home pages that individuals create on free services like Geocities
are devoted to celebrating certain entertainers, movies or
programs. Existing entertainment providers, like Viacom's MTV, and
new Internet start-ups like Sonicnet, offer online fan forums.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always looked at a media business as a club house people
join, whether they're fans of rock music or the old television
shows of `Nick at Night,''' said Fred Siebert, the president of MTV
Networks Online, which is building a big new site for fans of all
types of music. ``When kids watch television, they're on the phone
talking about it to their friends at the same time. The Internet
just provides an opportunity to make that sense of community all
the closer.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the increasingly interactive Web, big entertainment
producers are looking to build direct relationships with their
customers, cut out intermediaries like MTV, and, perhaps most
important, turn the fan-oriented sites into potentially profitable
services in their own right.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney, for example, has built an elaborate site at ABC.com
(www.abc.go.com) with advertising-supported material pegged to its
television shows. The most popular areas relate to its daytime soap
operas, where viewers go for plot updates, backstage interviews and
to express their own opinions about whether any given love affair
is destined for the altar or the trash heap.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, like others, is also moving to profit from selling goods
to fans online. In a Valentine's Day test, Barbara Walters listed
her choices for the most romantic movie, book and compact disk on
her daytime television show ``The View.'' ABC.com then presented
links so viewers could buy her picks on video, including
``Casablanca'' and a Frank Sinatra compilation, from merchants
paying a commission to Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Warner has had similar sites, supported by advertising and
commerce, devoted to its many television and movie properties. Now
it is going a step further with an elaborate offering called Acme
City (www.acmecity.com) that lets fans build their own home pages
devoted to Warner properties.
</P>
<P>
   Warner is even willing to let users incorporate sounds and
images of its characters into their own home pages, something many
other media companies officially ban because of copyright concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who create home pages devoted to your products are
the ones who will buy your albums the day they are released and see
your movies five times,'' Moloshok said. In Acme City's first 10
weeks, some 200,000 people have registered to build home pages. The
most popular topic: Loony Toons.
</P>
<P>
   But the business is hardly loony. Unlike the all-purpose
home-page sites, which Moloshok said typically charged less than
$10 for every 1,000 viewers of an ad, Warner has been able to
charge $15 to $22.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you place your ad over our site devoted to Loony Toons
you know what the content is,'' he said. ``If you are in a generic
community, the ad could be over a page on animation, knitting or
some alternate lifestyle.''

PATE HATES 17TH HOLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Steve Pate figures the staid Masters, with its
wide fairways and slick, undulating greens, was a perfect fit for
his game if not his fun-loving personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought this was by far my best chance to ever win
a major because of the way I putt,'' Pate said before Sunday's
final round. ``I don't three-putt very often, which is a good
attribute on this course. You have to drive it well but not
perfectly, which is good for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, it was tempting to size the Agoura Hills resident
mentally for a green jacket Sunday afternoon when he came out of
the gate and coaxed 10 straight pars out of Augusta National.
</P>
<P>
   Would the first of golf's four majors go to a Southern
California Junior Golf alumnus for the third year in a row? Pate
was nicely positioned to match the success here of Tiger Woods in
1997 and Mark O'Meara in 1998 when he made the turn tied for the
lead at 5 under par.
</P>
<P>
   The former UCLA golfer was one of six players who owned or
shared the final-round lead. His afternoon took a turn for the
worse at the 11th hole when he hit an errant second shot and
settled for a bogey 5.
</P>
<P>
   Birdies at 13 and 15 elevated Pate to within one of the leader,
Jose Maria Olazabal. He fell back with consecutive bogeys at 16 and
17, the latter of which was Pate's Waterloo. He bogeyed it all four
days, those four excess strokes effectively separating him from the
winner, Olazabal.
</P>
<P>
   Pate didn't want to comment on the hole _ which turned out to be
the third- most-difficult for the week _ after carding his
1-over-par 73. ``No good can come of me talking about it,'' he said
with a shrug. His playing partner, Davis Love III, wasn't so
circumspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say it, but that 17th green is unplayable,'' said
Love, who carded a 71 to finish second. ``It's like putting on
ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Pate, 37, finished in a tie for fourth with Bob Estes at 4-under
284, his finest finish here since his tie for third in 1991. He has
three top-six finishes in six appearances here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had told me at the beginning of the week that I'd be
tied for fourth, I'd have thought it was great,'' Pate said. ``But
the way it turned out, I'm not feeling too good right now.''

looked like an accident in a Crayola crayon box.
</P>
<P>
   His golf shirt was lime green. His corduroy pants were kelly
green. The eye-offending combo would have made Martha Stewart
blanch.
</P>
<P>
   That Rodriguez had the nerve to wear this clashing get-up to the
Kingdome Sunday was a dead give-away of the shortstop's current
state of disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be the drugs,'' first baseman David Segui said,
rolling his eyes at the major league sartorial faux pas committed
by the usually super-slick, Armani-clad Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Rodriguez said, attempting to defend himself. ``It's
green for the Masters.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's post-operative knee might have meant a few
doctor-ordered painkillers were on his training table. Three days
after arthroscopic surgery, he had the right to act and feel a
little woozy.
</P>
<P>
   And Rodriguez's teammates and friends could afford to tease the
young man. He will be back in action soon. The four to six weeks
Rodriguez is expected to miss with torn cartilege in his left knee
is probably an outside forecast, if you consider all the advice he
is getting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, there are a lot of doctors around here. Dr. Segui. Dr.
Martinez. Dr. Griffey,'' Rodriguez said, as if his older, wiser
teammates were all but telling him this knee surgery is a rite of
baseball passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out two weeks when I had it done,'' Segui said,
remembering his 1997 knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long did it take you?'' Rodriguez asked Dave Henderson,
the former Mariner who made a point to stop by the Kingdome
clubhouse Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a different situation than you do. I had to get ready
for the playoffs. I was back in two weeks,'' Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Rodriguez got up out of his chair and applied the
first bit of pressure on his tender leg by walking down the length
of the Mariner clubhouse _ without his crutches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch how fast I bounce back,'' Rodriguez said, hobbling off
to rehab.
</P>
<P>
   After an opening week like this past one, with Rodriguez
diagnosed with torn cartilege and then his impressive replacement
Carlos Guillen tearing an anterior cruciate ligament in a freaky
rundown play Saturday, the Mariners had to wonder. Is their middle
infield more of a jinxed minefield?
</P>
<P>
   Guillen, mind you, led the M's in spring, setting a club record
with 35 hits. He was ready to claim his place in the big leagues,
until Tony Phillips took him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like it. Ever,'' said Jamie Moyer,
the winning pitcher in the Mariners' 11-8 win over Oakland Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really an unfortunate thing, although Alex seems like
he's on his way back. I don't care what club you're talking about,
though. That's the key part of any club. Any team in baseball, top
to bottom, that's where your team is the strongest. Pitcher.
Catcher. Second base. Shortstop. Centerfield. That's where a lot of
the game is played, so when you're missing those two guys up the
middle, you're really hurting,'' Moyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, all those infield errors and not enough back-up led
to near disaster, especially at second and third base as Joey Cora
and Russ Davis struggled, each leading both leagues in errors by
position.
</P>
<P>
   We can only imagine what would have happened if Segui had not
vacuumed up so many errant throws and cherry-picked so many wicked
hops.
</P>
<P>
   But this season ... goodness gracious.
</P>
<P>
   The infield, and particularly the middle infield, was a bright
spot. It was supposed to be shored up stronger than the Ballard
locks, in large part because Guillen was turning out to be much
better than the no-name minor leaguer most locals assumed he was
when the M's got him from Houston in the Randy Johnson deal.
</P>
<P>
   But now, five games into the season, the entire middle infield
has been forced to take a knee.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Guillen hobbled into the clubhouse to join Rodriguez in
what Ken Griffey is calling the Kingdome MASH unit. Guillen, who
will have surgery in 10 days and faces up to nine months of rehab,
said he did not speak with Oakland leadoff hitter Tony Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips was booed at every at-bat but none of the Mariner
pitchers took a turn at returning the painful favor to him. To most
of the players, what Phillips did was within the realm of
reasonable force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony plays hard but he doesn't play dirty,'' Griffey said as
he helped detail how Guillen's knee was blown out not by Phillips'
collision but right before it, when Guillen planted his leg to try
to check the runner.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Mariners, they got lucky last season when
Cleveland's John Hart agreed to send David Bell to Seattle in
exchange for Cora. Now Cora is back home in Puerto Rico, managing
his local baseball team and the M's, thankfully, have Bell to eat
up the remaining 156 games in the season at second base.
</P>
<P>
   As for shortstop, the M's have brought up Giomar Guevara, who
started off the game by overthrowing Segui not once but twice for
two errors before settling down. They also have 31-year-old Domingo
Cedeno to share duties until Rodriguez comes back.
</P>
<P>
   As of now, with a ton of advice from his meddling but
well-meaning teammates and with Guillen out for the season,
Rodriguez seems willing to take the accelerated road to recovery.

 &HT;    Once again, The Shark sinks
 &HT;    EDS: Corrects headline.
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn

<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ The moment was fleeting. Greg Norman led the
Masters by himself at Sunday's final round at Augusta National, an
eagle on No. 13 sending him to the top of the leaderboard and the
massive gallery into a frenzy. The view from there must have been
majestic. This lasted all of two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   His playing partner at the Masters was friend Jose Maria
Olazabal, who had led by a shot but then trailed by one when
Norman's 25-foot, right-to-left putt dropped. It was Olazabal's
turn, from 21 feet for a birdie and share of the lead, and he
nailed it. The Great White Shark's moment was over.
</P>
<P>
   And, essentially, so was his quest to earn the elusive green
jacket. Norman bogeyed the next hole and was unable to make a
birdie in the remaining four, dropping to third behind Davis Love
III and champion Olazabal, who finished at 8-under for the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   It was a piercing defeat for Norman, who had a four-day total of
283, including Sunday's 73. But it was also rewarding. He had a
legitimate shot with five holes to play on the same course that
made him an international sympathetic figure. The 1996 meltdown was
that bad, one of the worst in majors history: squandering a
six-shot lead on the last day to Nick Faldo. But Sunday he did not
collapse. He was valiant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a successful week and a sad week all rolled up into
one,'' he said. ``I feel good I'm back where I know I can contend
again. This is not a heartbreak. I'd like to say I could've won. I
had my chances. I got my nose to the front, but not all the way
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``(So) this is easier to take,'' he added. ``Ninety-six was a
totally different animal - the tournament, the emotions, the way I
lost. I climbed a pretty good mountain today.''
</P>
<P>
   He was talking the confirmation of his physical recovery from
shoulder surgery and, most importantly, his mental strength. When
he finished Saturday one shot off the lead, the questions persisted
everywhere about his ability to hold up after having imploded on
the '96 Sunday. Norman answered them in impressive, if not
victorious, fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty good with myself and what I did,'' he said.
``Don't take that the wrong way. I'm sad I lost. . . But don't make
a mountain out of a molehill on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: He lost, but it was more the course and Olazabal
beating him than himself.
</P>
<P>
   Norman did contribute, however. His tee shot on No. 14 hit a fan
and landed in the rough. His 7-iron second shot from 138 yards
carried to the back fringe of the green and he 3-putted for bogey -
his taste of first gone.
</P>
<P>
   Then Norman dropped to third when he made a six on the par-5 15.
Still, he held on to hope until the end, even after Olazabal
matched his par on a tough putt on 17, a green so slick Love called
it ``unplayable.'' Down two shots going to 18, Norman mused to
himself: ``If I make a 2 (on 18) like somebody else did to me, I
might still have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't. Olazabal was unshakable. Norman embraced him when it
was over, a very different embrace from the one Faldo gave Norman
in '96. This time, the Shark, 44, had enough reason to talk of
playing into his 50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a warrior in that arena is what it's all about,'' he
said. ``It was an enormous emotional experience. . . I put
everything into perspective. The reality is that I came out, played
hard, but not well enough to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he enjoy golf more now that before the Masters, Norman,
victor in defeat, answered: ``Absolutely.''

 &HT;    Wohlers changes mind, refuses reassignment with Braves
 &HT;    (EDS: Must credit Atlanta Journal-Constitution.)
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mark Wohlers had a change of heart since talking with
manager Bobby Cox and general manager John Schuerholz on Friday
when they informed him he was designated for assignment in AAA
Richmond in hopes that he would regain the form who made him one of
the premier closers in baseball from 1995-97.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers, who suffered a relapse in his comeback attempt in his
first two outings this spring (six walks in two-thirds of an
inning), seemed eager to accept the assignment to Cox and
Schuerholz on Friday. But on Sunday Wohlers notified Schuerholz he
was refusing it.
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz said the decision didn't completely surprise him.
</P>
<P>
   ``While he first indicated he was very optimistic and interested
in accepting the assignment, he obviously decided, either on his
own or after talking to someone, that he was not going to accept
the assignment,'' Schuerholz said. ``That's his right under the
Basic Agreement. I'm disappointed that the whole process didn't
work, for Mark's sake and the team's sake. It would have been the
perfect ending.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers could have accepted the assignment, refused it, or
declared for free agency. By refusing it, the Braves are still
responsible for his $5.2 million salary unless they trade him
within 10 days. They will release him if they can't work out a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Among teams believed to be interested in Wohlers are the
Pittsburgh Pirates and the Arizona Diamondbacks, both of whom would
pay a portion of Wohlers' salary. Schuerholz said some clubs had
expressed interest in Wohlers over the winter and early spring but
he would not divulge which ones.
</P>
<P>
   While Schuerholz expressed regret that Wohlers refused the
assignment, he stood by the decision he made on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Mark was a big part of our success,'' Schuerholz
said. ``He showed in spring training he has a chance to recapture
some of his outstanding major league capabilities. We were hopeful
he'd do it with us. As everybody who watched our team the other
night realized, we had no choice but to make a move. Our bullpen
was not going to survive.''

RANCH (Phoenix) Five former employees of Arizona Boys Ranch face a
crucial hurdle this week in their battle against charges that they
murdered a 16-year-old client at the home for delinquents in March
1998. The defendants will appear Tuesday in Pinal County Superior
Court for a preliminary hearing, where Judge Richard Fields is
expected to decide whether there is probable cause for a trial.
While most preliminary hearings are perfunctory events, defense
lawyers said they intend to use the forum as a three-day mini-trial
in this case. And it will be preceded with a hot dispute over
motions seeking to dismiss the charges entirely. By DENNIS WAGNER.

SPORTS COLUMN: CHECKETTS STAYS AFLOAT OVER MESS HE CREATED
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ On days like Sunday when everything
seemed so right, so wonderful, you looked at the New York Knicks
and wondered, ``So what's the problem?'' They stormed the New
Jersey Nets' home court and flattened a team that is supposedly on
the rise.
</P>
<P>
   After the Knicks beat the Nets Sunday, 93-78, the Nets' interim
coach, Don Casey, said, ``There's nothing wrong with New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Knicks appeared to be teetering: they had lost
three consecutive games, five of six, and if you believe what you
read, the entire front office was headed for the guillotine. There
was a spate of good old-fashioned speculation over who would be
fired first.
</P>
<P>
   Initially it was Jeff Van Gundy, the Knicks' beleaguered head
coach, whose players supposedly had quit on him. The scrutiny
became so ferocious that Ernie Grunfeld, the Knicks' president, who
has miraculously escaped scrutiny for the last decade, found
himself smoked out, accused of squandering $68 million on a
haphazard collage of players with incompatible skills.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Knicks won a game in Atlanta on Friday and turned in a
gem Sunday against the Jayson Williams-less Nets. Every penny
seemed well spent: Marcus Camby, whose arrival had sent the beloved
Charles Oakley to Toronto, scored 15 points off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Fire the coach? Fire the president? Why?
</P>
<P>
   So Sunday was another one of those moments when victory becomes
a metaphor for a grand turnabout. Van Gundy tossed a double-edged
bouquet to Marcus Camby: ``He played hard and continued to work
hard,'' Van Gundy said, ``and when you do that, you become
coach-able.''
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell said: ``I am glad we are able to put two wins
together. We are feeling a lot better. Confidence is a lot greater
now. This is something the team can build on.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing said, ``The last two games, we were playing the
way we should have been playing all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the Nets were blowing kisses. Kendall Gill said:
``The Knicks have one of the best teams in the East. They have the
players, but they need to believe in themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephon Marbury was not so charitable. ``They still need a point
guard,'' Marbury said. ``They'll never win no championship with
them two guys, ever. Never. They will never, ever win.''
</P>
<P>
   I'll take that concept a step further: The Knicks may not win
with the current backcourt, but they won't win championships with
the current front office, either.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Mayfield, in another era, sang, ``If there's a hell
below, we're all going to go.'' That applies to the Knicks, whose
age-induced slide over the last five seasons led to this season's
maelstrom over who might be fired: Van Gundy or Grunfeld?
</P>
<P>
   But the executive who has floated like a feather in and out of
the storm is Dave Checketts, the Madison Square Garden president.
He has ridden in a sleek luxury car and made it through all the
egg-throwing without being touched.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the cavalcade of bizarre maneuvers has had his blessing, has
been his design. Grunfeld is the facilitator. Now Checketts is
gently nudging his pal down the plank.
</P>
<P>
   If Van Gundy walks the plank, Grunfeld should follow. If
Grunfeld walks, Checketts, the architect of this puzzle without a
plan, should jump, too. Checketts is no idle spectator; he is a
master of being in it but not of it.
</P>
<P>
   When the Knicks traded for Latrell Sprewell, Checketts said the
Knicks had made the move because they wanted to get past the second
round of the playoffs. Checketts even traveled to Milwaukee to meet
with Sprewell and sat with him for two hours asking tough
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, when Checketts was asked about the ugliness
surrounding the Oakley trade, he said, ``I wish we had done that
differently.'' Then he shifted the burden to Grunfeld.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try to put yourself in the place of a general manager,''
Checketts said, ``who, on the one hand, would like to acknowledge
the contributions of a player, and on the other hand, does not want
to spend so much time that it detracts from the job at hand, and
that's to go out and win a game. It's not an easy situation.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's going on here? ``I think you're seeing a bad situation
that has been created by losing,'' Checketts said. ``I see a team
that is losing more than they should. People say, Well, why is
this? Where does it come from? Is it the mix of talent? Are they
too small to compete in the half-court East without Charles
Oakley?''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' front office has effectively fooled season
ticket-holders into believing they are riding a winning horse when
what they are riding is the same old merry-go-round. They get off
after an exhilarating ride without having gone anywhere. At a more
cynical level, the Knicks are simply background music for corporate
schmoozing; one more amusement park ride.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are all sorts of intrigues. Patrick Ewing recently
went over Grunfeld's head to make an appeal for Van Gundy;
Checketts promised him that Van Gundy would remain the coach
through this season and next. Sunday, Van Gundy referred
cryptically to outside forces attempting to drive a wedge between
coach and players. Checketts escapes and floats above the chaos he
helped manufacture.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, Sprewell, Camby _ even Ward and Childs _ may yet bail out
the whole lot of them. Or they could hit another slick spot and
slide. Just remember: If there's a hell below. ... &QL;

MOHAWKS SEE CASINO AS A WAY OUT OF POVERTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. REGIS MOHAWK RESERVATION, N.Y. _ In the Mohawk language,
there is a word for ``greetings'' _ sekon _ and a word for
``money'' _ ohwista _ but there is no word for what tribal leaders
see in the crimson-red Akwesasne Mohawk Casino, now open for
business.
</P>
<P>
   And what they see is profit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as hundreds of visitors turned off wind-whipped Route 37
Sunday and into the casino, only the second licensed casino to open
in New York State, profit and ohwista and the good they could bring
were uppermost in the minds of just about everyone who lives here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been waiting for 10 years for this to happen,'' declared
a Mohawk chief, Paul Thompson, rapping his knuckles on one of the
casino's 62 green-topped blackjack tables, fully stocked with both
Canadian and American gambling chips.
</P>
<P>
   Casino gambling, the only economic engine that has ever worked
on any American Indian reservation, is about to become a way of
life for the St. Regis Mohawks. But here on New York's border with
Canada, where people drive to Ottawa and Montreal and fly to Albany
and New York City, it is a gamble borne of desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Few communities in America need more than the St. Regis
Reservation, with a population of 10,000, does. The reservation,
wedged between rural Franklin and St. Lawrence counties, is a grim
patchwork of weeds, liquor and convenience stores and gas stations,
with no industry to employ its people, no high schools to teach its
children and no great future to offer its few college graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no other alternative,'' Chief Hilda Smoke, who once
opposed the idea of a casino on her ancestral land, said while
strolling through the $30 million casino on Saturday. ``We need a
way to get out of poverty. We need 20 miles of water lines, double
that of sewer lines. From that money, we could build our schools.''
</P>
<P>
   At Akwesasne, the name the Mohawks have given to their
territory, gambling was once regarded as a road to despair. The
emergence of private, unregulated gambling operations on the
reservation in the 1980s bitterly divided the tribal leadership.
They made a few operators rich, but the wealth did not spread. In
1990, two men were killed in a fight over gambling after the
federal government closed the parlors.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, all that seems like ancient history. The Akwesasne
Mohawk Casino, towering over acres of black ash and poplar trees
still waiting for the green kiss of spring, will be a unifying and
liberating force, not a divisive and deadly one, Mohawk elders
said.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually overnight, the casino, with its 1,000 workers, became
a larger employer than the General Motors plant in Massena, N.Y.,
five miles to the west, and about equally as large as the sprawling
Reynolds aluminum plant a few miles farther west along the St.
Lawrence River. About half of the casino workers are Mohawks, and
that ratio is expected to rise over time.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is the pride of ownership, even if it is, for
now, shared with an outside management company. Most of the $30
million needed to build the casino came from Ivan Kaufman, a Long
Island investor who drew experienced casino managers from around
the country and set up a management company to run the casino on a
five-year contract. After five years, the tribe will have the
option of assuming full ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman said he expected the casino to reap $100 million
annually. More than $40 million of that will be profit, casino
operators say. And 75 percent of the profit will go to the tribe,
Ms. Smoke said.
</P>
<P>
   And that, she and other Mohawk leaders hope, will pay for much
more than water and sewer mains. They envision guaranteed health
care for every tribal member, a youth center, a nursing home and,
if the money really flows, a Mohawk high school, built by Mohawk
hands for Mohawk children. Now, teen-agers must leave the
reservation to attend high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just unbelievable,'' said Thompson, marveling at the
casino's purple-accented Art Deco interior, where ceramic-tiled
columns and old-fashioned neon lettering suggest a Roaring '20s
motif. ``It's really going to turn the tide of unemployment,''
which grips about half of the reservation's adult population, he
said. ``Our people can work at home, retire at home, with a
pension.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the enormous riches casinos have heaped upon other
Indian tribes _ the New York Oneidas and the Mashantucket Pequot
tribe in Connecticut reap hundreds of millions of dollars each in
profits from their casinos annually _ a windfall of cash for the
St. Regis Mohawks is not a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   Their casino is smaller and more remote than the others. For
now, the Akwesasne casino must earn its riches solely from its 90
gambling tables, which include blackjack, craps and roulette. But
its long-term success depends upon the 1,100 video lottery
terminals, the low-maintenance, dollar-gobbling electronic slot
machines that generally account for about 80 percent or more of any
casino's profits.
</P>
<P>
   The video lottery terminals have not been installed yet. Their
arrival depends on negotiations with the State Racing and Wagering
Board, which by law can tax a percentage of those profits.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest challenge the casino faces, however, is
attracting customers. To make millions, casino managers acknowledge
that they must find a way to lure more than 4,000 people a day to
blighted Hogansburg, N.Y., best known for its central location
between the rural New York towns of Massena and Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone with a stake in the casino, therefore, is counting on
one particular type of gambler to flock here. ``We're banking on
the Canadians,'' Kaufman conceded at the casino's black-tie opening
gala on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   With Ottawa to the northwest and Montreal to the northeast,
Hogansburg and the new casino form the lower tip of a triangle from
which the casino is expected to draw 4,000 customers daily, said
Richard Duda, casino marketing manager.
</P>
<P>
   To better compete with casinos in Ottawa and Montreal, the
Akwesasne Mohawk Casino will operate 24 hours a day every day and
is equipped to accept American and Canadian currencies. It has also
adopted what its managers hope will become a slogan up north:
``Play Canadian, win Canadian.''
</P>
<P>
   One hour after opening at 10 a.m. Sunday, that strategy seemed
to be working, as tourists, most of them Canadians, crammed many of
the blackjack tables. ``The casino in Montreal makes this look not
so nice,'' said Dan, a Canadian gambler who refused to give his
last name. ``There's four floors, you can't get a seat.'' But he
said he believed that the Akwesasne casino would make money, too.
``There will be a big percentage of Montreal people in here this
summer, because they'll get frustrated'' by the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Some questions about the propriety of making the casino the
foundation of the community linger. But they will probably fade if
gambling proves to be the ladder that helps the St. Regis Mohawks
step out of their well of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is 100 percent good? No,'' said Chief Ed Smoke after
cutting the ribbon during Saturday's gala, ``because nothing is 100
percent. But it's a 180-degree turnaround from 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   If and when the money comes, Smoke said, he and the other tribal
elders will have yet another ancient word on their minds. That word
is ``niawen,'' which is Mohawk for ``thank you.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John M. Reznikoff remembers an August day two years ago, when he
sat with his family on a beach on Cape Cod and felt on top of the
world. He had established himself as a respected dealer in stamps,
coins and other collectibles, even locks of hair from famous
people. But he was best known for his vast collection of autographs
of noted figures, tens of thousands of them, including every
president, from Washington to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It was no easy feat, especially in a business so quirky and
insular, where a person's word and trust mean everything. But just
a week later, Reznikoff's world came apart, undone by allegations
of fraud, betrayal and a shattered friendship. His reputation was
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   It all turned on hundreds of documents, supposedly handwritten
by John F. Kennedy, that he was helping a close friend sell.
Reznikoff recalls that the friend, who had already sold 200 of the
documents to more than 100 investors for several million dollars,
tearfully confessed to him that all the papers were fakes, forged
by him. Reznikoff said he soon came to see that his friend's life
had been full of deceit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to describe the feeling,'' Reznikoff said. ``You
work on something, and everything's rosy for four or five years,
and then it's like somebody punches you in the stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   The friend, Lawrence X. Cusack III, recanted his story the next
day, Reznikoff said, but the seed of doubt had been planted. On his
lawyer's advice, Reznikoff secretly taped a conversation with
Cusack. He gave the tape to the U.S. attorney's office in
Manhattan, hoping to clear his own name and helping to bolster the
criminal case against Cusack, whose trial on fraud charges begins
Monday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, government prosecutors say ``the evidence is
overwhelming'' that the documents are forgeries and that Cusack
``is the person responsible.'' The most explosive of the papers
purports to detail an affair between Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe,
and Kennedy's agreement to pay hush money to the actress to remain
silent about their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Cusack has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and has maintained
in numerous interviews that the papers are genuine.
</P>
<P>
   In a hearing on Friday, Judge Denise L. Cote signaled that she
expected that Cusack would try ``to rebut any implication that he
forged or even knew of any forgeries.'' Neither Cusack's lawyer,
Robert F. Katzberg, nor officials with the the U.S. attorney's
office would comment about the impending trial.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the jury weighs Cusack's guilt or innocence, the
central drama of the trial may be Cusack's relationship with
Reznikoff, who is expected to be the government's chief witness and
whose tape will offer some of the government's most crucial
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The tape transcript, a draft of which has been filed in public
court records, shows Cusack as a conflicted and distraught man,
admitting that he had misled friends, associates _ even his wife _
and had given people the false impression that he had served in the
Navy in Vietnam and had graduated from Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   He seems unable to extract himself from the web of lies. ``It's
sort of like, how and when do you 'fess up?'' Cusack says at one
point, adding, ``How am I going to explain that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You start covering for yourself,'' he explains later, adding,
``It's like a self-perpetuating lie that you can't get away from.''
He ultimately decided, he said, to let the lies be his ``cover
story'' and ``let it sit.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he concedes, ``It just got out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Cote has allowed most of the tape to be admitted into the trial,
over the objections of Cusack's lawyer, Katzberg, who contends that
some aspects could prejudice the jury. It is also not clear from
court records how Cusack views the taped conversation, or how
Katzberg will portray it to the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Reznikoff's lawyer, Russell M. Gioiella, said he advised his
client to make the tape because he saw no other way for Reznikoff
to prove his own innocence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a recent interview at Gioiella's office in lower Manhattan,
Reznikoff discussed his relationship with Cusack, although he
avoided talking about some aspects of his conversations with Cusack
because they might be used at trial.
</P>
<P>
   He said he first met Cusack in 1992, when he bought some stamps
from him, and grew to like him. ``I was impressed with how he
carried himself, the way he talked,'' he recalled. They socialized
together; their wives became friends. Reznikoff called him ``a very
close friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in 1993, Cusack first showed Reznikoff copies of the
Kennedy papers, the government has said in court papers. Cusack had
said that he had found them in the office of his late father,
Lawrence X. Cusack Jr., a prominent lawyer who had represented the
Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Reznikoff said he saw no reason to disbelieve Cusack or to
suspect any bad faith on his part, and he helped him obtain letters
of authentication from handwriting experts for every document that
was eventually sold.
</P>
<P>
   At some point in 1994 or 1995, the government says in court
papers, Cusack invited Reznikoff to attend a ceremony at the U.S.
Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md., where one of Cusack's relatives
was a plebe.
</P>
<P>
   As a federal prosecutor, Paul A. Engelmayer, described the event
in court papers: ``To buttress his false claim of Navy service,
Cusack on that occasion wore the full dress-white uniform of a
lieutenant commander, with a chest full of medals, including the
Naval Cross, and as a result, received salutes from thousands of
midshipmen.''
</P>
<P>
   Reznikoff says he was impressed by his friend. ``One of the
things that was most endearing about him,'' he said in the
interview, ``was his military background. I'm a patriot. I have an
intense appreciation of patriotism.''
</P>
<P>
   After questions were raised in August 1997 about the papers'
authenticity, Reznikoff returned from a vacation in Truro, Mass.,
to his office in Stamford, Conn., and met with Cusack on Aug. 25.
</P>
<P>
   `` Cusack broke down, cried and stated that he had been
praying,'' the government said in a federal complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Reznikoff asked Cusack whether the documents were forged.
``Cusack responded by asking whether they could just give the
purchasers their money back,'' the complaint says.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, ``Reznikoff asked Cusack if he had forged all of the
documents, and Cusack said yes,'' the government said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon thereafter, Cusack called Reznikoff and took it all back,
the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Reznikoff said that for weeks he was utterly confused about
where the truth lay, and in October consulted with a lawyer,
Gioiella.
</P>
<P>
   Gioiella advised him to protect himself, and to meet again with
Cusack, with a tape recorder running.
</P>
<P>
   Reznikoff said he resisted this plan, hesitant to betray a
friend. He said he finally agreed for his family's sake, fearing
that he would be dragged into the government's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In the secretly taped session on Oct. 18, Reznikoff recounted
for Cusack their earlier conversation, and he recalled how Cusack
had sat there holding his head, crying and admitting that he had
forged the papers, the transcript shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're sitting there and you're telling me that you're guilty,
that you did everything, that everything's fake,'' Reznikoff says,
according to the transcript.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm listening to you,'' Cusack replies.
</P>
<P>
   In the transcript, which runs 30 pages, Cusack is shown
equivocating and shifting ground, while still maintaining that the
papers are genuine. But he does not deny Reznikoff's version of his
earlier confession. Nor does he suggest that Reznikoff had a role
in any forgery scheme. The government has said in legal papers that
the tape shows that Reznikoff ``had not been aware of the
forgery.''
</P>
<P>
   The transcript also shows Cusack admitting that he did not serve
in the Navy. Reznikoff asks why Cusack misled him, reminding him of
their trip to Annapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw you wearing that uniform and I saw 3,000 people saluting
you,'' Reznikoff says, adding: ``I believed all along from Day One
that you had this unbelievable military career. And I loved that
about you.''
</P>
<P>
   Reznikoff adds, ``I need an explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   Cusack says it began as a joke among friends years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``But why would you let your friend, supposed friend, believe
that?'' Reznikoff asks. ``Why would you let me believe? Why would
you let me have that faith in your military career?''
</P>
<P>
   That was when Cusack said he did not know how to `` 'fess up,''
that it had all got out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Reznikoff said he now wonders how much of their friendship
itself was genuine. If the government's allegations are borne out
at trial, he said, then Cusack was involved in the forgery scheme
as early as 1993 _ shortly after the two men met.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very generous to me throughout those years and to my
family,'' Reznikoff said. ``If everything that's alleged is true, I
almost feel more sorry for him than I feel angry.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he hopes he was not manipulated. ``I like to think that
some of the friendship was real,'' he said, ``and I think I am a
good friend, someone who's fun to be with, and that I do add to a
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``But who knows? I don't know what the ultimate answer
to that question is. A lot will be revealed in the weeks to come.''

ADVERTISING: RETROSPECTIVE ISSUE OF ADVERTISING AGE SURE TO FIRE UP
CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Is there anything that the folks who work in
advertising enjoy more than gossiping about their competitors?
Perhaps it is strolling down that side street off Madison Avenue
named Memory Lane to judge the merits and demerits of campaigns,
slogans, jingles and characters, not to mention the executives who
have led the major agency, marketing and media companies.
</P>
<P>
   The trade publication Advertising Age is offering 134 pages of
grist for the mill with a special retrospective issue devoted to
what the editors label ``the advertising century.'' The term is a
play on the phrase ``the American century,'' coined by Henry Luce,
the founder of Time Inc., who is No. 17 on a list of the ``top 100
advertising people.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen? What do you mean? How can Henry Luce be ranked only
17th on any list? What the ...
</P>
<P>
   Aha! Now you see one reason why Advertising Age published the
issue. In an industry so filled with opinionated participants, the
discussions generated by such lists are, to quote the old slogan of
the Cunard Line, half the fun _ which by the way did not make the
Advertising Age list of the 10 top slogans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of why you do it is to stir up debate,'' said Scott
Donaton, the New York-based editor of Advertising Age, published by
Crain Communications Inc. ``We knew and expected that.''
</P>
<P>
   First on a list of the issue's most contentious designations
would undoubtedly be the declaration of the Marlboro Man, created
by the Leo Burnett Co. in Chicago for what is now the Philip Morris
Cos., as first on a list of the ``top 10 advertising icons,''
followed by familiar figures like Ronald McDonald, the Jolly Green
Giant, Betty Crocker and the Energizer bunny.
</P>
<P>
   It has been apparent since last year that a decision to select a
cigarette smoker as the premier advertising icon _ however great
his prowess as a salesman _ would be playing with, well, fire.
That's because of a backlash to advertisements that Crain had run
to promote the issue, which speculated that the Marlboro cowboy
character could win that honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can dispute that the Marlboro Man is a brilliant
creation and a powerful icon,'' said William D. Novelli, president
of the National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids in Washington, an
advocacy organization. ``The question is, what harm has it done?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd urged folks in the public health community to tell
Advertising Age that the Marlboro Man is not a fitting icon for the
advertising industry,'' he added. ``And we intend to step up the
pace, mailing reprints of the icon article to Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Novelli's organization bought ads in Advertising Age to counter
the Crain ads. That continues with a full-page ad in the special
issue carrying a headline based on data showing that nearly 60
percent of underage smokers smoke Marlboros: ``Six in 10 kid
smokers agree. The Marlboro Man is a marketing icon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For more than 40 years,'' the text reads, the character ``has
led kids down the road to addiction and disease. It's time to send
him out to pasture _ for good.''
</P>
<P>
   The article acknowledges the charged nature of the designation,
describing the puffing cowpoke, who is home on the conceptual range
known as Marlboro country, as ``the most powerful _ and in some
quarters, most hated _ brand image of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But even those ad professionals who abhor the tobacco
industry,'' the article asserts, ``will, when pressed, agree that
the Marlboro Man has had unprecedented success as a global
marketing tool.'' Indeed, Marlboro has grown to become the world's
best-selling cigarette brand.
</P>
<P>
   The character ``was born at a time when cigarette smoking was
widely accepted,'' said David S. Klein, the Chicago-based associate
publisher and group editor at Advertising Age, before ``the tobacco
issue divided the advertising industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlboro threads its way through the issue, much like the smoke
that once wafted from the cigarettes puffed by the singer Julie
London, who warbled the brand's pitches in television commercials _
missing, alas, from the list of top jingles starting with ``You
deserve a break today'' for McDonald's at No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlboro campaign by Burnett was ranked third on the list of
the ``top 100 advertising campaigns,'' behind only ``Think small''
for Volkswagen by Doyle Dane Bernbach, now part of the DDB Needham
Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group, and ``The pause that refreshes''
for Coca-Cola, by the D'Arcy Co., now part of the D'Arcy Masius
Benton &AMP; Bowles Communications unit of MacManus Group.
</P>
<P>
   And the Marlboro campaign is described as ``a legendary example
of advertising's power to build a global business'' that
``ultimately became a magnet for legislative crackdowns on tobacco
marketing'' in a profile of Leo Burnett, the agency's founder, who
is No. 3 on the list of 100 advertising people.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising Age's ranking of Burnett contrasts with an issue of
Time magazine published in November that named him the only
advertising executive on a list of the 20 most influential business
leaders of the century. An executive who was a runner-up to him in
Time's estimation is ``the hands-down winner'' of Advertising Age's
honor as the most important advertising person: William Bernbach, a
co-founder of Doyle Dane.
</P>
<P>
   Bernbach was ``the single most influential creative force in
advertising's history,'' Advertising Age declares, for low-key
campaigns that sold with a smile for products like the VW Beetle,
Levy's rye bread, Life cereal, Alka-Seltzer, Polaroid cameras and
Cracker Jack.
</P>
<P>
   The special issue was distributed with subscription copies of
the March 29 issue of Advertising Age. Additional copies are being
sold on newsstands at $9.95 each. Plans call for a special report
on ``the next century'' in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be ranking the greatest commercials of the 21st
century,'' Klein said, smiling. Donaton predicted that they would
be ``affixed to our eyelids.''

EDITORIAL: MERGERS THAT FOSTER COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, April 12:
</P>
<P>
   It seems that barely a day passes without word of some new
linkup within the once-separate industries of telephone, television
and the Internet. Deals worth billions _ in stock _ are made by
companies that have yet to earn $100 million in profits.
</P>
<P>
   The latest reports say that MCI Worldcom, itself a product of a
series of mergers, may buy Nextel, a wireless telephone company in
which Craig McCaw is a major investor. If that deal happens, McCaw,
who previously sold McCaw Cellular to AT&AMP;T, will have sold wireless
companies to the two largest long-distance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Many consumers watching all this unfold no doubt are confused
about the economic and technological forces driving these mergers.
They may also be troubled by what looks like a headlong rush toward
consolidation. But while antitrust regulators need to keep a close
watch, most of these deals reflect a vibrant state of competition,
not an effort to end it.
</P>
<P>
   The deals also reflect a state of confusion among the people
running the companies involved. They can see that developing
technologies are changing the world they will compete in, but they
cannot see clearly which technologies will prevail. Some very
successful companies fear they could become the 21st century's
equivalent of buggy-whip manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Local telephone companies worry that they will lose their core
customers to cable companies. Long-distance phone companies fear
that local companies will steal their customers, and vice versa.
Both local and long-distance companies worry about competition from
wireless carriers. Cable companies hope to seize Internet access
business, but know that they will need to make huge investments if
that is to work out.
</P>
<P>
   All worry that the Internet could somehow take away part of
their franchise. Wireless phone companies are afraid that they will
lose their most valuable customers if they cannot offer service
around the world with one phone number.
</P>
<P>
   An important factor in this merger wave is the popularity of
Internet stocks, which have risen to extraordinarily high prices.
That has made it difficult for established companies to afford to
buy Internet firms, but it has made it easy for Internet companies
that have high-priced stock to expand by buying other companies for
stock. Both Yahoo and Amazon.com have done deals to expand their
Internet offerings, while America Online, a company now valued by
the market at about the same amount as I.B.M., took over Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the deals may prove to have been brilliant steps that
positioned companies as leaders in a technology destined to become
dominant. Others no doubt will have been bad for everyone except
the investment bankers who pocketed fees for arranging them. The
fact that companies are pursuing such deals is a positive one,
however, reflecting both the uncertainty and the excitement of the
technological progress now being made.

HILL TINKERING WITH MECHANICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Angels went into this season hoping that
pitcher Ken Hill's surgically repaired right elbow would be
healthy. Hill's health, manager Terry Collins has said, is the key
to the pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Hill's elbow is not only feeling good and strong,
but it might be feeling a little too good and strong.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Hill had adjusted his mechanics last season to
help take the strain off his painful elbow before the surgery. But
now that his elbow is fine, he's had trouble adjusting back.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said the problem has to do with his leg kick during his
delivery motion.
</P>
<P>
   Hill struggled in his first start, giving up four runs and six
hits in 41/3 innings against the Indians. He walked four, but
Collins said Hill was barely missing with his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``His ball has so much movement, it's a matter of getting a feel
for what he's got to do with it,'' Collins said. ``I think he's
very close to having it figured out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who will start today against the Rangers, says he has
figured it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working on some things, and I watched some video
tape of last year,'' Hill said. ``I'm doing some things different.
I just recognized it yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Praise for Velarde: The Angels looked into getting a second
baseman during the offseason, one that was young and could run
well. When their efforts failed, they ``settled'' on Randy Velarde.
</P>
<P>
   But Velarde, even at 36, is probably in better shape than anyone
on the club. Although he missed a year and a half after
reconstructive elbow surgery, Velarde is as strong as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy's a baseball player,'' Collins said. ``He doesn't
quit, he never slacks off. You know what kind of workaholic he is.
In batting practice, every swing has a purpose. I knew when he came
into camp he was ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Velarde had four hits in Saturday's game and took a .429 (9 for
21) batting average into Sunday's game, best on the club.
</P>
<P>
   Break for Greene: Todd Greene was not in the lineup Sunday so
that he could be as rested as possible for today's game. It will be
Greene's first start at catcher in a major-league game since Aug.
20, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, who has been hampered by shoulder problems the past year
and a half, caught in only four spring-training games and never
more than six innings. But Collins said there's a chance Greene
will go all nine today.
</P>
<P>
   Change of plans: Center fielder Jim Edmonds did not arrive in
Texas on Sunday, which was surprising news to Collins. Collins
thought Edmonds, who is on the disabled list, would be in town so
that he could take batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels won't take BP today because it's a day game, so
Edmonds is now expected to join the team Tuesday in Oakland. He's
eligible to come off the DL Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Series finale: The Angels and Rangers finish their series today
(11:35 a.m.) at The Ballpark in Arlington. Hill (0-1, 4.15 ERA)
will start for Anaheim against Texas' Mark Clark (0-0, 8.31).

COMMENTARY: ENDURING THE UNENDURABLE IN POSTWAR JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVEN R. WEISMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States occupied and ruled Japan with an iron grip for
six years and eight months after World War II, a period nearly
twice as long as American involvement in the war itself. Yet
because of lingering sensitivity over that anomalous moment in
history, little discussion or reflection has occurred in either
country about what happened and how people felt during the
occupation, at least compared with commentary about the war and
Japan's economic rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   With America increasingly frustrated over bending others to its
designs around the world, it is startling to remember that only 50
years ago the United States actually tried and largely succeeded in
remaking a hated enemy in its own image. A powerful new book,
``Embracing Defeat'' by John Dower, draws on archives, diaries and
recollections to recount the events after 1945 in great detail,
shattering one myth after another about the occupation era.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, the occupation was a success. For all its
current economic problems today, Japan is an egalitarian and
democratic state that continues to embrace an American-imposed
Constitution renouncing war. But from Emperor Hirohito on down to
the lowliest peasant, Japanese behavior in the immediate postwar
years comes across in Dower's book as far more clever and complex
than is suggested by the cliches of a happily liberated people
embracing democracy and pacifism from on high. Resentment and fear
of the occupiers were never far below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, on the other hand, emerge in this account as
basically humane rulers whose behavior was often appallingly
hypocritical. The Japanese effectively encouraged prostitution to
protect the rest of their womanhood from defilement. Hundreds of
thousands of American G.I.'s exploited this arrangement, treating
the country as a giant brothel at a time when the occupation
enforced equal rights for women.
</P>
<P>
   Dower, a professor of Japanese history at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, has written a sobering monument to the law
of unintended consequences. He shows how much of the mysteriously
hierarchical conduct that frustrates Japan's trading partners today
is rooted in crucial decisions imposed by the occupation forces
under Gen. Douglas MacArthur. The so-called ``Asian model'' of
state capitalism, in which government bureaucrats provided
``administrative guidance'' to business and industry, is often
discussed by experts ``in a vapor of rhetoric about Confucian
values,'' he notes. In fact, it arose in large part from a
conscious decision by the occupying forces to preserve Japan's
wartime economic structure, and to use Japan's elite bureaucrats to
carry out their policies.
</P>
<P>
   The occupation's initial goal was to instill ``democratization
and demilitarization,'' but American authorities also did not
hesitate to suppress left-wing disruption and criticism. ``This was
not a screen for weeding out threats to democracy (as official
justifications claimed),'' Dower writes, ``but rather a new chapter
in an old book of lessons about acquiescing to overweening power
and conforming to a dictated consensus concerning permissible
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Dower's prize-winning ``War Without Mercy,'' published in 1986,
opened many people's eyes by documenting the racial hatred and
cruelty on both sides. The most explosive chapters in this book
will surely be Dower's unflinching study of Hirohito, much of it
based on material only recently available. Dower shows that
MacArthur insisted on keeping the emperor in office to guard
against chaos and Communism in Japanese society, but that he
secretly used the threat of Hirohito's removal to get the Japanese
parliament to accept the Constitution. Dower theorizes, however,
that not holding Hirohito accountable for his wartime conduct
effectively transformed him into a false symbol of innocence. That
step, along with the arbitrariness of the war-crimes trials,
allowed the Japanese people to think that they, like the emperor,
had been hijacked by militarists and bore no responsibility for the
war themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Far from the aloof, dithering image cherished by many Japanese,
Hirohito is seen here as a wily survivor who managed to convince
Americans that he did not know about Pearl Harbor in advance, when
the evidence shows that he did, and that he had unequivocally
renounced his divine status in a speech, even though Japanese
listeners understood him to be doing no such thing.
</P>
<P>
   Only 50 years later it is possible to see that the destitution
and destruction of Japan could lead one day to reconciliation and
prosperity. In defeat, Hirohito called on the Japanese to ``endure
the unendurable.'' Dower has provided the most human and moving
account yet of how that struggle led to a triumph over fear, hatred
and humiliation. &QL;

see that his friend's life had been full of deceit. ``It's hard to

WHITMAN MAY MEET HER REMATCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Gov. Christie Whitman begins her run for the
U.S. Senate with so many political advantages that it would be easy
to mistake her for a prohibitive favorite.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, who announced last week that she would seek the
seat being vacated next year by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, a Democrat,
has been blessed with a robust economy and low unemployment rate.
She faces no major primary challenge and can trumpet her own record
of enacting 17 separate tax cuts. It is also clear that Whitman
relishes the possibility that her Democratic opponent may be former
Gov. Jim Florio, the man she unseated in 1993 after his $2.8
billion tax increase enraged many New Jersey residents.
</P>
<P>
   But political experts in both parties warn that the volatility
of the New Jersey electorate, together with the fact that Whitman
has never managed to win more than 50 percent of the vote, will
make the 19 months leading up to the general election tumultuous
and unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans in New
Jersey by 25 percent to 19 percent _ nearly 300,000 voters _ and
that gap has widened in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   And even though Whitman has nationwide stature as a tax-cutting
Republican with moderate views on social issues, she has never won
the overwhelming support of New Jersey voters.
</P>
<P>
   There are two predominant theories for Whitman's lackluster
performance at the polls. Her supporters tend to blame her
political opponents' negative advertising, which often portrays her
as a patrician out of touch with the everyday concerns of the poor
and middle class. Others say that her cool management style
projects an image of competence _ the governor as CEO _ but does
little to forge an emotional bond with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Her 1997 re-election bid, which many New Jerseyans expected her
to win handily, nearly ended in disaster. James McGreevey, the
little-known mayor of Woodbridge, lambasted Whitman for New
Jersey's high property taxes and auto insurance rates and came
within 1 percentage point of an upset.
</P>
<P>
   If Florio does run against Whitman _ which is not a sure thing,
given many Democrats' reservations about the former governor _
their rematch is likely to be fierce.
</P>
<P>
   In their last contest, the Whitman campaign was so rocked by
Florio's relentless criticism that Republicans ran a television
commercial that featured Whitman's 16-year-old daughter, Kate,
defending her mother's honor. Florio, whose tax increase had
incited a recall effort early in his term, pulled ahead in the
polls within six weeks of Election Day. Whitman then unleashed her
most potent weapon, a proposal to cut income tax rates by 30
percent. Although voters were initially skeptical of the promise,
it helped her eke out a narrow victory.
</P>
<P>
   Florio appears eager for a rematch. He maintains that the tax
increase was the only responsible way to pay for a court-ordered
increase in school aid, but concedes that he did not explain it
well enough to voters. Florio also contends that Whitman's vaunted
tax cuts have forced the state to increase its debt and have
brought higher local property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But Florio still faces a difficult battle to win the Democratic
nomination. Many party leaders outside his political base in South
Jersey are openly courting other potential candidates, like Rep.
Frank J. Pallone Jr., a congressman from Long Branch; Susan Bass
Levin, the mayor of Cherry Hill; Michael Murphy, the Morris County
prosecutor; B. Thomas Byrne Jr., the former chairman of the state
party, or Jon S. Corzine, co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever ends up opposing Whitman, even some Republicans say she
will also face the personal challenge of focusing her message so
she connects with voters. Carl Golden, press manager for her 1993
campaign, said the criticism he heard most often was that Whitman
gave intellectual answers to emotional questions.
</P>
<P>
   When Whitman was asked Thursday why her approval rating among
voters was not as high as previous second-term governors, she said
she hadn't a clue. She also showed little interest in a drastic
make-over of her campaign style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, I don't rely on polls for anything I do, and just
as fortunately, I've managed to win my last two elections,'' she
said. ``Would I have wished to have rode in on the people's
shoulders with a huge plurality? Of course. Everybody does.''

 SOUTH CAROLINA COLLEGE STUDENT DISAPPEARS ON TRIP TO NEW YORK
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A college student from South Carolina who came to New
York on a school trip disappeared after attending an advertising
symposium on Friday, the police said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The student, Sarah Efird, 21, was last seen on Friday afternoon
leaving an office building in Times Square, said Sgt. Gerry Falcon,
a police spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Efird, a senior studying advertising at the University of
South Carolina in Columbia, won a trip to New York to meet
advertising executives, her mother, Frances Efird, said in a
telephone interview from Greenville, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday morning, Ms. Efird attended a symposium at Saatchi &AMP;
Saatchi, in Greenwich Village, Mrs. Efird said. She apparently left
behind her backpack containing her wallet, a jacket and her plane
tickets, her mother said.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, Mrs. Efird said, Ms. Efird accompanied a friend
to the offices of the cable network Nickelodeon at 1515 Broadway in
Times Square. The friend, who was not identified, had hoped to get
a job interview with Nickelodeon.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Efird left by herself. Mrs. Efird speculated that her
daughter may have left alone because a friend's birthday was on
Saturday and she wanted to surprise him with a gift. She was seen
on a surveillance camera leaving the building without a coat, her
mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Efird never rejoined her group at the Doral Hotel, and never
contacted two friends from South Carolina that she had planned to
spend the weekend with in New York, Mrs. Efird said.
</P>
<P>
   The police described Ms. Efird as 5 feet 4 inches tall, about
115 pounds, with medium-length brown hair and hazel eyes. They
urged anyone who may have seen her to call, toll-free, (800)
577-TIPS.

LT. COL. LEOFRIC BOYLE, 100; SAVED ANTELOPE FROM EXTINCTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Leofric Boyle, a retired British Army officer who
played an important role in saving from extinction the Arabian
oryx, a type of antelope, died on March 21. He was 100.
</P>
<P>
   His death was reported on April 2 by The Times of London, which
did not say where he died or where he had lived.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle was born in Trivandrum, India, where his father taught at
the Maharajah's College. He attended King's School in Canterbury,
England, entered the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, near
London, in 1917, became an officer in the Royal Artillery and
retired in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   His military years in India left him with a passion for wildlife
conservation. The Times of London said, ``Service in India, with
its rich fauna, stimulated a natural interest in animals of all
sorts.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyle went on to become secretary of a conservation group, the
Fauna Preservation Society (now called Fauna and Flora
International), from 1950 to 1963. In those years he threw himself
into numerous campaigns to safeguard various species of wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Notable among the campaigns was a successful effort, named
Operation Oryx, to keep the Arabian oryx from being killed off.
That exotic pale-bodied quadruped has long, straight horns that
sprout in a narrow V from its head.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, tireless poachers were whittling away the
Arabian oryx's numbers and threatening its survival. But with Boyle
overseeing Operation Oryx, as The Daily Telegraph reported, the
campaign succeeded in ``capturing, with great difficulty, four oryx
and transplanting them to the Phoenix Zoo, in Arizona. There they
were successfully bred, and the species has since been reintroduced
to its natural habitat.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyle was awarded British and Dutch decorations for his services
to wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 48 years, Valerie, and four
daughters from his first marriage.

   NEW YORK _ With a strong cast, good musicians and deft
direction, Handel in the modern opera house confounds its critics.
Prior speculation on the Metropolitan Opera's new ``Giulio Cesare''
has been justifiably dim: the wrong space, the wrong instruments,
the wrong style. Yet the Met's new production captivated its
audience on Saturday night and with reason.
</P>
<P>
   The singers are uniformly splendid. Jennifer Larmore (Caesar),
David Daniels (Sesto), Sylvia McNair (Cleopatra) and Brian Asawa
(Tolomeo) attack Handel's florid figuration with confidence and
sing simply when he requires it. As Cornelia, Stephanie Blythe's
big, dark sound meets the Baroque on common ground. She does not
shrink her dimensions; Handel does not raise his voice. Rather a
place is found where both parties remain themselves.
</P>
<P>
   John Nelson conducted a similar set of negotiations. Nelson's
musical direction had the full attention of stage and pit. Ensemble
was precise, and spirits were buoyant. The Met's string sections
sang out but largely without vibrato, in the 18th-century manner.
``Giulio Cesare'' is a nightmare for horn players (it was probably
even more so in Handel's pre-valve era), and there were teetering
moments on Saturday. Important, however, was the correctness of
scale: the resonance that was needed to fill a big hall and yet the
exactitude befitting a smaller one.
</P>
<P>
   The success of this all-American cast is less surprising when we
remember that it was singing an Italian opera written by a German
for British audiences. The problems of ``Giulio Cesare,'' however,
go beyond singing. For here is opera as bloodthirsty seriousness
with a coy streak of humor running through its middle.
</P>
<P>
   John Copley's restraint is admirable. Ms. McNair's Cleopatra is
a subtle exercise in ditsiness. Dignity is everywhere. Ms. Larmore,
singing with great command, projects a powerful presence. Ms.
McNair is a charmer. Daniels, urged on by an audience full of
supporters, sang with beautiful tone and urgency. If there is a
musical memory I shall take away from this season, it will be he
and Ms. Blythe in their duet of leave-taking at the end of Act I.
</P>
<P>
   During the set pieces, stage tableaux do not give off the usual
Handelian impression of people standing around and waiting. Deeper
into the more serious arias, Copley walls off the singers from the
set behind them, pushes them toward the front of the stage,
creating a sense of closeness between character and listener.
</P>
<P>
   Opera seria, with its strings of circular arias, comes with
difficulty to audiences bent on action. This production does very
well convincing us that it is not what these characters do that is
paramount but what they are thinking.
</P>
<P>
   The Met's ``Giulio Cesare'' also survives sets reminiscent of a
Las Vegas hotel lobby. Gilt and marble are the materials of choice,
obelisks and throw pillows the recurring accents. Female
supernumeraries balance big headdresses while posing like
showgirls. Tolomeo is dressed up as Ming the Merciless; Cornelia
might be Elizabeth I.
</P>
<P>
   The look of this production is distracting but not fatally so.
The supporting singers _ Julien Robbins, Mariusz Kwiecien and
Daniel Taylor _ are excellent. The sets were by John Pascoe and the
costumes by Michael Stennett. This is Handel that meets the modern
world with intelligence, talent and style. Given the built-in
disadvantages, you will be surprised just how good it is.

CHINA SETS UP ITS OWN WEB SITE TO LURE U.S. CONCERNS' BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (rk) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first official foray into electronic commerce for the
world's fastest-growing economy, the government of China has set up
an Internet site intended to help its companies market goods to
American corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.meetchina.com, which was announced Monday , is
operated for China by U.S. Business Network Inc., a San
Francisco-based company. According to Ken Leonard, the company's
chief executive, the site will be a clearinghouse of sorts for
businesses in mainland China that wish to connect with American
customers via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government will help U.S. Business Network solicit
companies that will pay $1,500 to $3,000 to participate in the
site, and receive help developing American contacts, with 20
percent of the proceeds going to the government. Participating
Chinese companies will be able to post information about themselves
and their products or services, along with contact information that
includes e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Leonard said, Chinese companies were not allowed
to make direct contact with foreign companies, but instead were
required to first seek export licenses from the government. In
recent months, China has been more liberal in issuing such
licenses, particularly for smaller companies, and dealing directly
with Western businesses. It is smaller companies that China is
trying to promote through the new site, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From China's perspective, it fits perfectly,'' said Patrick
Meehan, research director for the Gartner Group, a technology
consulting firm. ``It's kind of open, but not all the way. It's
part of the `great fire wall of China' strategy, where they have a
way to funnel information in and out of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Michael Borrus, co-director of the Berkeley
Roundtable on the International Economy, the site's launch is more
notable for its political implications than as a breakthrough on
e-commerce. Observing that the government has been trying to
privatize China's state-owned industries, Borrus said, ``This will
facilitate that process by pushing them to reform via contact with
the West.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It also falls into the classic Chinese model of dabbling in
something long enough to see the various impacts before you commit
to it completely,'' Borrus said.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, who lobbied the Chinese government for a year before
receiving its go-ahead, said the site would focus first on Chinese
businesses that are involved in the information technology
industry. He added that the site was being marketed on the Internet
_ through banner advertisements on Yahoo, for example. &QL;
