<HEADLINE> Indian PM Spells out Government Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister A.B.
Vajpayee in a nationwide speech over TV and radio here this
evening said that the question before the electorate was good
governance.
</P>
<P>
The good governance means development, elimination of
corruption, transparency and accountability in all aspects of
government.
</P>
<P>
As a first concrete step towards bringing about honesty in the
administration, from top to bottom, the Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP) government would make public the income and assets of all
members of his cabinet within 30 days from today, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will not hesitate to take the sternest measures to see that
corruption is eradicated from public life, that there is no misuse
of funds allocated for development schemes, that they are utilized
with care and diligence," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, he pledged allocation of 60 percent of plan fund
for agriculture and rural development.
</P>
<P>
Instead of entering into a debate on "communalism" or the true
meaning of "secularism", a determined effort was being made to
obscure (these) issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
Both the Congress and the Third Front regarded the BJP as a
"communal" party and have been making joint efforts to stop the
BJP rule so as to form a secular government in the country.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee severely criticized these parties and groups. He said
that their "single point agenda was to stop the BJP from ruling
the country at any cost" and "come to power by any means".

<P>
ROME, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Thomas Muster of Austria took the
title of the Italian Open tennis tournament after beating Richard
Krajicek 6-2, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Muster, ranked No.2 in the world, needed over two hours to beat
his big-serving opponent.
</P>
<P>
The victory reinforced Muster's credentials as a favorite when
he begins defense of his French Open title later this month.
</P>
<P>
Muster turned the pressure on at the start of the match and the
the windy conditions did not help Krajicek. He had 10 aces in the
match but at the same time, made seven doublefaults.
</P>
<P>
Krajicek had not lost a set before meeting Muster and the
latter proved too strong for him.
</P>
<P>
It was Muster's second consecutive Italian Open title and he
brought his match record on clay over the past two years to 94-3.

<HEADLINE> New Bosnian Serb PM Voices Full Commitment to Dayton Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 19 (Xinhua) -- New Bosnian Serb Prime Minister
Gojko Klickovic, appointed by the parliament earlier today, said
his government would consistently and fully implement the Dayton
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Bosnian mediator Carl Bildt in the Serb
stronghold of Pale, Klickovic said he would continue to comply
with all the provisions of the Dayton accord on condition that the
Muslim-Croat federation did the same thing, the Tanjug news agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Klickovic told reporters that he would hold a cabinet session
next week to ease the current political tension in the wake of the
Wednesday removal of his predecessor Rajko Kasagic by Bosnian Serb
President Radovan Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
Kasagic was sacked reportedly due to his moderate policy and
good relations with the international community, while the Western
countries have been strongly opposing his dismissal and fear it
would deal a blow to the fragile peace process in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Serb Parliament Speaker Momcilo Krajisnik today also confirmed
that the Serb authorities would honor its obligations in the
Dayton agreement, signed late last year in Paris to end more than
three years of bloodshed in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
He added that out of the 56 lawmakers at the extraordinary
session, only one voted against the appointment of a former
economist Klickovic.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb Vice President Biljana Plavsic, who would assume
most of Karadzic's duties in the future, also vowed today to
ensure the full implementation of the Bosnian peace accord.
</P>
<P>
She said that she listed three things as top priorities --
peace, further affirmation of the Serbs and implementation of the
state policy approved by the Serb parliament, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Kasagic, who had originally rejected the removal, said here
today that he honored the parliament resolution and accepted the
dismissal of his premiership.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said Karadzic was stepping down under the
mounting pressure from both the international community and
Yugoslavia, which was the main sponsor of the Serb entity in
Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Dialogues Crucial to End Party Conflicts in Cambodia: Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's acting head of state,
Chea Sim, today called on the nation's two ruling parties to end
their conflicts and create a stable political situation through
dialogues, state television reported tonight.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim, also head of the Cambodian People's Party (CPP), said
that the two ruling parties, the CPP and the FUNCINPEC, should
iron out their differences through sincere talks, rather than
being engaged in conflicts, which he said will not benefit either
side.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim suggested that the two parties hold talks as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
He also said that all parties and all the people in Cambodia
should unite as one under the leadership of King Norodom Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Cambodia reportedly saw a tense atmosphere in its
politics, which is caused by "conflicts" and "split" between the
two ruling parties, the CPP and the National United Front for an
Independent, Neutral, Peaceful and Unificative Cambodia
(FUNCINPEC).

<HEADLINE> Israel Rejects Accusations on Shelling in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel today rejected accusations
from Syria and Lebanon that its shelling this morning was a breach
of the ceasefire agreement of understanding reached following
Israel's blitz on south Lebanon last month, reported Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir said that the
Shiite guerrilla group Hezbollah (Party of God) is operating in
populous areas and "it is Hezbollah who should be blamed if
civilians are injured."
</P>
<P>
He added that when the Israeli government is "interested in
stability in south Lebanon, it will continue to grant the Israeli
army freedom of action against hostile activities."
</P>
<P>
It was shortly before dawn when an Israeli army unit spotted
the movement of a Hezbollah squad in the eastern sector of the
Israeli occupied "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers followed the Lebanese guerrillas and an Israeli
tank artillery opened fire trying to prevent the gunmen from
moving on or force them to retreat back. In the clash, an Israeli
soldier was wounded and at least two Hezbollah fighters were
killed.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Beirut, a 37-year-old Lebanese
housewife in a village was wounded in the foot when an Israeli
shell fell beside her. She was taken to hospital in Nabatiya,
north of the "security zone."
</P>
<P>
The incident aroused condemnations from both Lebanon and
Syria.

<HEADLINE> Cease-fire Extends in Tajikistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The cease-fire will be extended
in Tajikistan for another three months, a United Nations special
envoy announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Gerd Merrem, new U.N. special envoy on Tajikistan, said at
a press conference here that both the Tajik government and the
opposition group have agreed to extend the cease-fire for three
months from May 26.
</P>
<P>
He said that the opposition group had also agreed to
release 26 of the 300 prisoners in Tajikistan on May 28 as a
goodwill gesture for the political dialogue with the government.
</P>
<P>
He said that was the results from his separate meetings with
Tajik President Emomali Rakhmanov in his office in Dushanbe from
May 15 to 16 and Opposition leader Abdullah Nuri in Tehran from
18 to 19 May.
</P>
<P>
He said that he also met with diplomats and high-ranking
government officials from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran and other
CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) countries.
</P>
<P>
Gerd Merrem was appointed as a U.N. special envoy for
Tajikistan on May 2 and will be based in Dushanbe. He performs
the functions of head of the United Nations Mission of Observers
in Tajikistan and also provides good offices in the inter-Tajik
political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
There were many cases of cease-fire violation, and war and
bloodshed escalated in Tajikistan in the past few months.
Thus, the situation in Tajikistan has once again turned to an
international issue.
</P>
<P>
Last year a delegation of Tajik Islamists traveled to
Washington to draw the U.S. support but received a cold
welcome because Washington is reluctant to get involved in
such religious wars as what is going on in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Nationalists and Islamic groups who had been stripped of power
in 1992 with the aid of Moscow have again risen up against
Rakhmanov.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports indicate that President Rakhmanov has given in
to the request of the rebels and dismissed some high-ranking
officials.

AMMAN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan, the

the Eastern and Western Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during his meeting with visiting Singapore
Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar here today.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, the crown prince and the Singapore

exchanges between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Hassan said Jordan was keen to forge solid ties with countries
that have outstanding economic expertise, including Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The talks also dealt with the prospect of Jordan benefiting
from Singapore's expertise in developing sea ports.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Link Between Cancer, Infectious Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 19 (Xinhua)-- Growing evidence of the link between
cancer and infectious diseases would open up new possibilities for
prevention of cancer, the second most common killer in many parts
of the world.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1996 World Health Report issued Monday by the
WHO, the year of 1995 saw about about 6.6 million people killed by
cancer and 10 million new cases diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
While it is generally believed that environmental and lifestyle
factors as well as common practices such as diagnostic
radiographic procedures are largely responsible for cancer, the
link between infectious diseases and cancer is also becoming
increasingly clear, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the new report, up to 84 percent of cases of some
cancers are attributable to infectious agents like viruses,
parasites or bacteria. Over 1.5 million, or 15 percent, of the new
cancer cases occurring each year could be avoided by preventing
the infectious disease associated with them.
</P>
<P>
Specificly, the WHO estimated that some 550,000 new cases a
year of stomach cancer are attributed to the bacterium called
helicobacter pylori, transmitted in foods. The figures equals
about 55 percent of all cases of this cancer worldwide.
</P>
<P>
For liver cancer, about 434,000 cases a year, or 82 percent of
the world total, are due to hepatitis B or hepatitis C viruses.
The viruses are transmitted in several ways, including through
contaminated blood and sexually.
</P>
<P>
The WHO report also noted that sexually transmitted human
papilloma viruses are responsible for most of the 529,000 cases of
cervical cancer a year; 65 percent of cervical cancer cases are
due to this virus in industrialed countries, and 87 percent in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Viruses and other infectious conditions can cause cancer
through a number of different mechanisms. Effective vaccines are
only available against hepatitis B virus, and their use could cut
the number of liver cancers by up to 70 percent in areas such as
sub-Saharan Africa and eastern Asia, including China, WHO experts
said.
</P>
<P>
They hope that with the availability of vaccines in the near
future, human papilloma viruses which cause cervical cancer, and
possible increases in the risk of certain other cancers, can also
be effectively tackled.

allows foreign banks to open branches in its free trade zones in a
bid to attract foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> EAC Secretariat Faces Telecoms, Housing Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Telecommunication and staff
housing shortage are the most pressing problems facing the East
African Cooperation (EAC) Secretariat at the moment, a top EAC
official said today.
</P>
<P>
EAC Executive Secretary, Francis Muthaura told the Tanzanian
government newspaper, "Daily News" that his two deputies and
other staff members were yet to secure residential accommodation
in Arusha.
</P>
<P>
"I have already secured a house myself but my deputies are
still staying in hotels," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan diplomat, who took up the post after the launching
of the secretariat by the presidents of Tanzania, Kenya and
Uganda three months ago, said that staff required "certain level
of houses commensurate with their posts".
</P>
<P>
The EAC executive secretary also said telecommunication links
between Arusha and major cities in the region were problematic,
especially the links between Arusha and Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the Tanzania authorities will do something in view of
the importance of the secretariat," Muthaura noted, stressing
that efficient communications were vital for EAC operations.
</P>
<P>
He said the secretariat would initially employ a total of 23
people. These are three executives, including himself, six
professionals and 14 supporting staff.
</P>
<P>
The EAC Secretariat has been allocated the entire fifth floor
of the Kilimanjaro wing of the Arusha International Conference
Center (AICC). The furnishing and restructuring of offices will
start soon.
</P>
<P>
Muthaura said the premises were enough and ideal for the
secretariat's activities. "There are several committee rooms,
which enable us to host small meetings," he added.
</P>
<P>
The three East African countries, Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda
pledged to contribute a total of 1.2 million U.S. Dollars to
enable the secretariat to take off.

<HEADLINE> One Civilian Wounded in Israeli Bombardment in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 19 (Xinhua) -- One Lebanese woman was wounded and
two Hezbollah guerrillas were killed this morning in an Israeli
bombardment at south Lebanese villages.
</P>
<P>
This was the first civilian casualty since a cease-fire
understanding was reached between Lebanon and Israel on April 26,
which banned any attack on civilian areas of each side.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli bombing came in retaliation for an ambush on an
Israeli patrol by guerrillas of the Lebanese pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
One Israeli soldier was wounded in the fighting, bringing the
number of Israelis wounded by guerrillas to seven since the
cease-fire was enforced on April 27.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of the Shiite
fundamentalist Hezbollah, announced that one group of its
fighters ambushed today the Israeli patrol at 7:00 a.m. (04:00
GMT) near the hilltop ancient Roman castle of Shqif in Nabatiyeh
in the Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone."
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Islamic Resistance said that several
Israeli soldiers were killed and wounded in the fighting in which
the guerrillas used machine guns and anti-tank rockets.
</P>
<P>
In response to the guerrilla attack, the Israeli occupation
forces bombarded Iglim Al-Toffah, a place often used by Hezbollah
guerrillas to launch attacks at the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the area said that the Israeli forces at
Shqif fired sporadic shells at Marsa Hamra, Himma Arnon and Fart
Mnit.
</P>
<P>
A Hezbollah senior officer accused the Jewish state of
infringing the U.S.-mediated cease-fire understanding by shelling
south Lebanon villages.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Nabil Qawuq, Hezbollah's military chief in south
Lebanon, described today's Israeli bombardment as a "clear
violation of the goal and text of the April 26 understanding, which
stresses neutralization of civilians."
</P>
<P>
He said the Lebanese government should "bear its whole
responsibility" and to take fast steps to file complaints and
open investigation into the event.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that his party would not take hasty action to
revenge the bombardment.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire understanding did not deprive Hezbollah
guerrillas of the right to attack the Israeli occupation forces in
south Lebanon on condition that the attacks are not launched from
towns or villages.

<HEADLINE> More Weather Stations Established in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has established eight
major weather registering and reporting stations to help the
nationwide effort of developing agriculture, a local news agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency quoted Engida Mersha, acting head of
the meteorological forecasting and agricultural early warning
project of the National Meteorological Services Agency, as saying
that the new stations at different sites of the country are meant
to register and report the direction and speed of wind, humidity,
amount of rainfall and temperature.
</P>
<P>
He said these stations will be instrumental in providing the
agency with the necessary and essential climatic information.
</P>
<P>
His agency will use the facts it obtains from the stations to
solidify the information it receives via satellite so as to
provide the public in general and the peasantry in particular
with up-to-date meteorological data, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the standards of the International Meteorological
Organization, major weather stations in Ethiopia are very few in
number and the nation plans to increase the number from 95 to
120, Engida said.

<HEADLINE> Swaziland Not Delink Currency to Rand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 19 (Xinhua)-- Swaziland's currency Lilangeni
would continue to be linked with the devalued South African Rand, the
South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland's Finance Minister Derek Von Wissel said in Mbabane that
the devaluation of the Rand, which dropped from 3.6 against US Dollar
in February to 4.5 in May, had advantages and disadvantages to the
kingdom's economy, but that delinking of the two currencies would be
futile.
</P>
<P>
On the positive side, the minister said the falling Rand would
boost South African and Swaziland exports and subsequent earnings,
while on the negative side, consumer prices were likely to go up and
the amount of external debt would rise proportionately.
</P>
<P>
However, Von Wessel said keeping the values of the South African
Rand the same with Swaziland's Lilangeni, made it easier for travel
between the two countries and brought more tourists to Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is a small land-locked country surrounded by South
Africa and Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Companies to Come to Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of several
South Korean companies are expected in Tanzania early next month
for initial consultations with the Tanzanian government on
cooperation in the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed here over the weekend by South Korean
ambassador to Tanzania Seung K. Byun when talking with Minister
for Energy and Minerals William Shija.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Byun told Shija that if the consultations are
successful, the two sides would cooperate in power generation
as well as in oil transportation and storage.
</P>
<P>
Shija said Tanzania needs more power and that it requires more
cooperation with individuals as well as institutions in improving
power generation and distribution.
</P>
<P>
The minister, however, said the government's efforts to
explore oil in Tanzania are yet to bear fruits.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that cooperation with South Korea in
the energy sector will produce greater benefit to the country.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Salvation Party To Join PA Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Islamic
Salvation Party's higher committee has decided to participate in
the new cabinet of the Palestinian Authority (PA), The Jerusalem
Times, a Palestinian newspaper in East Jerusalem reported today.
</P>
<P>
Fakri Abdul Lattif, a spokesman for the party, told the
English-language paper, however, that it will only do so as part
of the work covered by the ministries of social services, public
work, labor, and education, and excluding anything politically
related to the Oslo Accords.
</P>
<P>
"We will participate in the new cabinet. Our aim is to reduce
the negative effects of the peace agreement," said Abdul Lattif.
</P>
<P>
PA President Yasser Arafat announced on May 9 during the
legislative Palestinian Council session held in Rafah, the names
of the members of his new cabinet. There are now 20 ministers in
the government and five with ministerial rank. The ministers were
sworn in Friday.
</P>
<P>
Freih Abu Muddein, Minister of Justice, told the paper that the
new ministerial structure was merely a continuation of the old one
with certain amendments. Most of the former ministers still retain
their ministerial posts. The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas),
Islamic Jihad, PFLP (the Popular Front for Liberation of
Palestine) and DFLP (the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine) are not included in the new cabinet, but five seats are
open to them should they choose to join.
</P>
<P>
PC Speaker Ahmad Qrei' described the new government as a
combination of technocrats and politicians.

<HEADLINE> UK Tories Haunted Again by Row over Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Britain's ruling Conservative party
has been plunged again into a heating row over Europe as a Tory
backbencher called for Eurosceptic members of parliament from all
parties to urge a referendum on a single European currency.
</P>
<P>
Sir Teddy Taylor, a well-known Tory Eurosceptic, warned today
that both the Conservatives and the opposition Labour were split
on this matter and he urged MPs from all parties to do more than
just talk together about this issue.
</P>
<P>
He argued that the best way to address this issue was that an
all-party movement be launched to force a referendum.
</P>
<P>
Taylor claimed that Britain's interests, over beef and fishing
quotas, would be damaged unless power was grabbed back from
Europe.
</P>
<P>
John Redwood, last June's beaten Tory leadership challenger and
former Welsh secretary, told Independent Television (ITV) today
that he supported Home Secretary Michael Howard, who called
Saturday for powers "to be repatriated from Europe to Britain".
</P>
<P>
He said Britons were "sick and tired" of seeing an unelected
court overturning their views and parliament.
</P>
<P>
But Redwood said that he did not want Britain to withdraw from
the European Union as demanded by some other Eurosceptics within
the Tory party.
</P>
<P>
He said that he wanted to negotiate with the EU for a much
better deal for Britain.
</P>
<P>
A clash on Europe also erupted within the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Michael Howard waged a tough attack on the
European Court of Justice and called for clawing back powers from
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
However hours later, Howard was rebuffed by Kenneth Clarke, the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, who warned Tory MPs against
"Europhobia".
</P>
<P>
"Like it or not, a successful relationship with Europe is vital
to our future," he asserted.

<HEADLINE> UK Government Urged to Promote Beef Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Britain's National Federation of
Meat and Food called on the government to promote British beef
sales, despite the BSE scare.
</P>
<P>
The federation, which represents high street butchers, warned
that 40 butchers are being driven out of business a week by the
BSE crisis, known as mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
Roger Kelsey, the federation's president, was quoted by local
press as saying that the collapse in the market for poorer-quality
beef products, combined with a squeeze on profit margins from a
rapid increase in the price of pork and lamb, had already forced
many small independent shops to close.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the government to invest money marketing British
beef as safe to eat once again before the European Union lifted
its worldwide ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
Official figures issued by the Meat and Livestock Commission
showed that a surge in demand for alternative meats to beef caused
prices for pork to rise by 10 percent last month, while the cost
of lamb increased by as much as 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the commission said that beef prices for some prime cuts
are now matching and even beating those for last year, while sales
are back to almost 95 percent of what they were.
</P>
<P>
However, Kelsey dumped hopes for a full recovery in beef sale,
saying that high street butchers were still experiencing a drop of
price between 15 and 50 percent, with shops in urban areas
especially hard hit.

<HEADLINE> Israel Rejoices over Failure of Assassination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel has condemned the attempt
on the life of Turkish President Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued today, the Foreign Ministry said, "We are
pleased that the attempt failed and send our best wishes for his
wellbeing."
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, President Ezer Weizman telephoned the
Turkish president to express his regret over the attack and said
he was glad that the Turkish leader was not injured.
</P>
<P>
A gunman, reportedly angry over Turkish -Israeli military
cooperation, tried to assassinate President Demirel at a shopping
mall in Izmt on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In February, Israel and Turkey signed a military training
deal, which irked Arab countries and Iran as well as Turks who
want the Moslem but officially secular country to move closer to
the pro-Islamic orbit.
</P>
<P>
The 72-year-old Turkish president escaped unhurt during the
incident. But a Turkish journalist and a policeman were injured
by bullets.
</P>
<P>
Demirel paid an official visit to Israel in March.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Airport to Undergo Big Revamping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Kennedy International Airport, New
York's primary airport, is undergoing a profound transformation
after 20 years of almost no improvement, New York Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The airport's managers and private developers have planned to
invest more than 3 billion u.s. dollars in upgrading the aging
terminals,rebuilding airport roads and parking lots and building a
rail line that will ease travel between Kennedy's terminals.
</P>
<P>
The poor condition of the airport, which was ranked third worst
in the world in a survey of international passengers this year,
has made Kennedy an embarrassment to New York.
</P>
<P>
For all of Kenney's problems, its old terminals and the
shortage of shops and restaurants, the central problem for
travelers has long been the incredible difficulty of reaching the
airport.
</P>
<P>
The construction will proceed in stages. The main terminal is
expected to be finished by 2000, and the final sections the
following year. The new terminal will have a centralized customs
processing area and better shops ad restaurants.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of the cost of the new building is expected to
be raised from fees charged to airlines using the terminals.
</P>
<P>
Port Authority Chairman Lewis Eisenberg said that the
combination of private and public funds is necessary to draw the
money and expertise needed to rebuild Kennedy.

ATHENS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Gerassimos
Arsenis and his visiting Albanian counterpart Safet Zhulali held
talks here today on bilateral defense cooperation, the NATO
partnership for peace program and developments in the broader
region.
</P>
<P>
Zhulali, who arrived here today for a three-day visit, told

encourage dialogue between Kosovo and Belgrade and expressed
Tirana's concern about the threat to the Balkans posed by the

Zhulali also stressed that Albania was opposed to any
settlement of the Kosovo problem by the use of force.

other Balkan countries to join NATO, the European Union and the
Western European Union.

''NATO's enlargement must include the southern part of
Europe,'' Arsenis said, adding that he might visit Tirana in
mid-July when an exercise has been scheduled within the framework
of the partnership for peace programme.

<P>
PYONGYANG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) has been working hard to ensure a good harvest
this year and prevent a repetition of last year's agricultural
disaster caused by unprecedented flooding.
</P>
<P>
Rice and maize, two of the country's main crops, are growing
well in many parts of the country after a busy spring planting
season, the government said.

The DPRK suffered huge losses due to flooding last July and
August, which killed 68 people and caused an estimated 15 billion
U.S. dollars of damage.

The floods caused by torrential rain affected more than 5.2
million people in 12 provinces across the country, and destroyed
many homes, schools, hospitals, factories, dams, bridges, roads
railways and other public facilities.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the DPRK government has
attached great importance to farm production, directing
agricultural authorities to improve soil quality and ensure

country unchanged when they meet Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Various kinds of official economic data, though contradictory
in some way, indicated that the economy is on the right track on
the whole.
</P>
<P>
"There is no urgency about changing policy," the USA Today
quoted an economist as saying.
</P>
<P>
The last Fed move was Jan. 31, when it cut two key short-term
rates a quarter-percentage point. That was the Fed's third easing
in seven months to stimulate a sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
Fed policy makers last met in March and chose not to change
rates.
</P>
<P>
The economy grew at a 2.8 percent annual rate the first quarter
-- enough to spark fears that consumer prices could rise more than
3 percent this year for the first time in five years, the paper
said. That also explains partly stock investors' worries about
rising inflation a week ago. They feared that the Fed would raise
short-term rates to slow the economy and inflation.
</P>
<P>
But analysts see no need to do so currantly. Investors on the
New York Stock Exchange also have the belief now and they pushed
the share prices to an all-time high, with the Dow Jones
industrial averages staying above its record level of 5,689.74
most of the morning session.
</P>
<P>
But long-term rates, set by the bond market, have risen nearly
a point since January 1, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Those higher rates make loans more expensive for consumers and
businesses, which could trigger a downturn.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Bulgarian Prime Ministers Hold Talks (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Videnov said his visit to China indicates that the two
countries cherish the common wish to further develop bilateral
relations. Bulgaria attaches great importance to its relations
with China, and regards it as one of its prime objectives.
</P>
<P>
He said that new achievements will be made in developing
friendship and relations of co-operation between the two countries
in politics, economics, trade, culture and other fields.
</P>
<P>
"Bulgaria highly values China's economic and social progress in
recent years, appreciates its policy of independence and
non-interference in other countries' internal affairs, and admires
its balancing role and positive influence in international
affairs," Videnov noted.
</P>
<P>
He re-affirmed that his government will stick to the policy of
"one China," recognizing Taiwan as an inalienable part of China
and refraining from forming official ties with it.
</P>
<P>
Sofia affirms that Tibet is an autonomous region of China and
the Tibet issue is an internal affair of China, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Li said that peace, stability and development are the common
wishes of the people around the globe, and China welcomes, and
will push forward, the process of multi-polarization in the world.
</P>
<P>
"But we should never neglect the fact that there still exist
hegemonism and power politics, as well as many factors of
uncertainties," Li said, adding that unremitting and long-term
efforts are called for in order to attain world peace and
development.
</P>
<P>
Videnov invited Li to visit Bulgaria at his convenience, and Li
accepted the invitation with pleasure.
</P>
<P>
After the talks the two prime ministers attended a signing
ceremony of agreements on public security, education, science,
patents and other fields.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Li held a welcoming ceremony in honor of
his Bulgarian counterpart.

<HEADLINE> UN Calls for Foreign Aid for Chinese Gender Statistics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior official from the United
Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) issued here today an
appeal worldwide for funds and technical assistance to China to
improve its gender statistics.
</P>
<P>
Lorraine Corner, UNIFEM regional program advisor, said that
improvement of China's gender statistics will make an
important contribution to international gender statistics,
particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, citing the fact that
Chinese women make up one fifth of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
She added that improvement of China's gender statistics will
help the country draw up policies for the development of women.
</P>
<P>
She made the remarks at a meeting of potential donors for
China's gender statistics. Attending the meeting, which was
presided over by Trine M. Lund-Jensen, assistant resident
representative of the UNDP, were officials from other UN
agencies as well as from the embassies to China of Russia, France,
Sweden and Finland.
</P>
<P>
Zhai Ligong, deputy director-general of the State Statistics
Bureau of China, said that China has identified fund shortage as
one of the major obstacles in its overall development of its
statistical reform.
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, China's current household surveys mainly
cover the income and expenditure of a household but rarely touch
on the differences between men and women in the family life.
</P>
<P>
Also, China lacks breakdown statistics by sex on employment,
income, property, education, health care and health conditions,
social and political participation, crimes and victims.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that foreign aid and technical assistance
could quicken China's adoption of international practices in the
field of gender statistics.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Chun Denies Armed Rebellion Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's former president Chun
Doo-hwan denied again in court today accusations that he staged an
armed rebellion during the 1979 military coup.
</P>
<P>
Chun, his successor Roh Tae-woo and other 11 defendants
appeared at a Seoul court for the eighth session of their trial on
charges of mutiny and treason in connection with the December 12
coup 17 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh have been charged with illegally arresting the
country's martial law commander Chung Seung-hwa, who was also
army chief of staff, to pave the way for a coup by a group of
elite military leaders.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who headed a joint military investigation team at the
time of coup, argued that Chung was held in connection with the
assassination of President Park Chung-hee in October 1979 which
plunged the nation into crisis.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that he got the permission of then president Choi
Kyoo-ha to arrest Chung and that his action was "legal."
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors believe that Chun and Roh engineered and staged the
military coup in 1979 which led to the armed suppression of the
demonstration in the city of Kwangju the following year.
</P>
<P>
They also accused Chun and his immediate successor Roh of
committing mutiny and treason in the coup, which thrust Chun to
power.
</P>
<P>
The two face a maximum sentence of death if convicted.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh have already appeared in court three times on
bribery charges relating to a massive slush fund from business
tycoons and face more trial sessions later.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Religious Leader Calls for Fighting against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran's religious leader Ayatollah
Khamenei today called on government officials and the people to
fight against cultural invasion which, he said, poses a grave threat
to the Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
Addressing officials from the Iranian Ministry of Culture and
Islamic Guidance, Khamenei noted that the cultural invasion might
be one of the most serious problems of the contemporary world.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei attacked the United States for pursuing its goal of
cultural invasion by applying cultural tools and intellectual
stocks.
</P>
<P>
He said that the cultural invasion is used against Iran as a
means to weaken the Islamic Republic and Islamic principles.
</P>
<P>
Iran put into effect a ban on satellite dishes last April as
part of the efforts to fight against Western cultural intrusion
despite widespread international and domestic opposition.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Iran's armed police have confiscated 2,250
satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
Ali Larijani, President of Islamic Republic of Iran
Broadcasting (IRIB), said recently that due to the obscene and
violent scenes shown on satellite television, Iranian parliament
was urged to legislate the ban on the ownership and use of the
satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
He brushed aside allegations that Iran put the ban on
satellite dishes in a bid to create a barrier for news and
information from around the world.
</P>
<P>
"The ban on the satellite programming is aimed to protect the
culture. We are not against the flow of information. People who
want news are using short-wave radio," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed, "the banning of satellite dishes is a
cultural question, not a political question."
</P>
<P>
But, the ban of the satellite dishes came under attack by many
people and even government officials. Some people are bold enough
to put on the dish again on the roof or in the bottom of swimming
pools in a bid to prevent any inspection from the police.

cancer, which affects 10,000 European citizens each year."

Associations across Europe will give out posters, brochures, films
and other material to improve public awareness of the disease.

JERUSALEM, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Labor's campaign information
director Haim Ramon and his Likud counterpart Limor Livnat met
here this afternoon to discuss matters related to next Sunday's
television debate between Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Likud
leader Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Ramon and Livnat agreed to consult with Peres and Netanyahu
and finalize the details later by telephone. They will then
announce where the half-an-hour debate will be filmed.
</P>
<P>
The debate, due to take place three days ahead of the
election day, is considered by both Labor and Likud to be
the culmination of the election campaign, and both parties'
campaign directors are taking pains to prepare their respective
candidate in the best possible way.
</P>
<P>
As the election campaigns for various parties are in full
swing, both Peres and Netanyahu have been busy wooing the
so-called "floating voters" which reportedly account for some 10
percent of the country's voters. These voters have not yet made up
their minds as to whom they will vote for the next prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest polls published at the weekend,
Peres retained his slight lead over challenger Netanyahu, but
the number of undecided voters has increased.

<HEADLINE> Coal Mine Reveals Hoard of Ancient Relics By Xinhua Writer Li Xiguang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shuozhou, Shanxi, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen years ago, when
US businessman Armand Hammer invested in a large coal mine near
the Great Wall in northern China, he never knew that it would
yield a hoard of ancient cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
The site of China's largest open-cut coal mine near Shuozhou, a
dusty town in northern Shanxi Province was the site of a
2,000-year-old battlefield, when an army led by Emperor Wudi of
the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD) won a decisive victory over the
nomadic Xiongnu whom the Chinese people living in Central China
had feared for hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, when the construction of the Pingshuo Coal Mine
started, archeologists have been racing against time to excavate
3,000 ancient tombs at the construction site of the coal mine.
</P>
<P>
"We have collected 28,000 artifacts from the site," said Sun
Xuerui, member of the archeological team and keeper of the team's
storehouse.
</P>
<P>
In a courtyard in downtown Shuozhou, Sun unlocked three heavy
iron gates and took this writer inside the storehouse, where some
of the finds are stored.
</P>
<P>
Among them are a large number of weapons including a bronze
arrowhead still stained with 2,000-year-old blood. "Its
crossbow was so heavy that it needed dozens of soldiers to shoot
it," said Prof. Dai Zunde, scientific advisor to the
archeological team.
</P>
<P>
"Shuozhou was the place where China's first emperor Qin Shi
Huang Di (259 BC-210 BC) built a city and a horse ranch as defense
against the Xiongnu," Dai said.
</P>
<P>
But most of the artifacts date back to the Han Dynasty. For
example, bronze mirrors with delicate female nipple designs
mounted on the backs.
</P>
<P>
"Many of the artifacts obviously came from the Mongolian
steppes. The gold- and silver-inlaid belt buckles were brought
here by the nomads and later influenced buckle designs in central
China," said Professor Dai.
</P>
<P>
Among the latest finds are 21 pieces of gold foil with designs
of horse racing, arrow shooting, dancing and running as well as
wildlife such as tigers, leopards, wolves, deer and elephants.

WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today announced he has decided to unconditionally extend Most

The announcement was made during his address to the 29th

<P>
Some of the artifacts came from as far away as the Central
Asia. Four bronze weights, which were commonly used to hold down
the four corners of a mat in the Han Dynasty, were shaped like
acrobats."The acrobats with Caucasian features obviously came
through Hotan and Loulan in today's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region," Dai explained.
</P>
<P>
The archeologists were most puzzled by the unusual burials in
some of the tombs. A young couple holding each other closely was
found in one of the tombs. "This most affectionate form of burial
together indicates that the couple was not married, but lovers,"
Dai said.
</P>
<P>
A warrior with an arrow protruding from his skull was found in
another tomb. "He was one of the millions of soldiers killed in
the wars here 2,000 years ago," an archeologist said.
</P>
<P>
"These findings have provided concrete evidence for the study
of the culture and people living along the Great Wall in northern
China 2,000 years ago," Prof. Ning Lixin, leader of the
archeological team remarked.
</P>
<P>
The State Bureau of Cultural Relics and the Shuozhou municipal
government have jointly decided to start the construction of a
museum to house these treasures later this year.
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, we are seeking the support of international
organizations such as United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization," said Jin Yinhuan, a local senior
official.

<HEADLINE> Strengthened Research in Tibetology Encouraged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese official has urged
better research in Tibetology, in a move to serve the unification
of the motherland and the unity of all China's ethnic nationalities.
</P>
<P>
Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, vice-chairman of the National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
made the call at a forum marking the tenth anniversary of the
China Tibetology Research Center.
</P>
<P>
The vice-chairman called on the Center to "refute the fallacy
that 'China has destroyed Tibetan culture and trampled human
rights in Tibet' by applying full and accurate data based on the latest
scientific achievements."
</P>
<P>
Founded on May 20, 1986, the China Tibetology Research Center
is a research group which concentrates on research into the Tibet
Autonomous Region and other Tibetan-inhabited regions in the
aspects of politics, economy, culture, history and religion.
</P>
<P>
The fundamental aim of the center is to facilitate the opening-up
and modernization drive of Tibet and other Tibetan-inhabited
areas, and serve the unification of the motherland and the
unity of all Chinese ethnic nationalities.
</P>
<P>
Over the past ten years the Center has undertaken a series of
key state research projects, including "Research into the
Relationship between the Tibet Authorities and Chinese Central
Governments Since the Yuan Dynasty" and "The Environment and
Development of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau".
</P>
<P>
The center's China Tibetology Publishing House has published
222 kinds of books, topping 930,000 copies.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Minister of Construction
Hou Jie met here today with British Deputy Prime Minister Michael
Heseltine, saying that China will continue co-operation with
Britain in urban water supply and treatment of waste water.
</P>
<P>
"Britain has good technology, equipment and management
expertise for solving water problems," Hou said, adding that China
is willing to maintain co-operation with the European country.
</P>
<P>
China's water supply mainly exists in cities, where 300 million
citizens dwell, said the construction minister, adding that the
country's rate of waste water treatment is also low.
</P>
<P>
Heseltine and his entourage, totalling 30 people, visited the
Ministry of Construction this afternoon, and had a 35-minute talks
with senior Chinese construction officials.
</P>
<P>
British representatives from major water supply or treatment
companies briefed Chinese officials on their business scope,
expressing their hope of getting a share of the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Heseltine began his seven-day visit to China on May 18. His
party consists of 270 people, twice the size of the group he led
to China last year, signaling that the two countries' exchanges
are expanding.
</P>
<P>
During the 35-minute meeting, British representatives said that
they would explore all forms of co-operation with China, such as
technology transfer and training of personnel.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Industrial To Go Public In Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Industrial Investment
Co., Ltd., the overseas investment arm of China's largest
metropolis Shanghai, will have its key operations listed on the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The listing vehicle -- Shanghai Industrial Holdings Limited
(Shanghai Industrial) -- comprises four manufacturing companies,
namely, Nanyang Tobacco and Wing Fat Printing in Hong Kong and
Shanghai-based Sunve Pharmaceutical and Shanghai Jahwa.
</P>
<P>
A total of 129 million shares will be offered at an issue price
of 7.28 HK dollars (0.94 US dollars) per share. It is learned that
20 percent of the shares will be offered for public subscription,
to start Tuesday in Hong Kong, and 80 percent for an
international placing to institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
Dealings in the company's shares are expected to begin on the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange on May 30.
</P>
<P>
Cai Lai Xing, chairman of Shanghai Industrial, is confident
that the company will become one of the successful Red-Chips,
China-backed stocks with good performance at the Hong Kong bourse.
</P>
<P>
At present, Nanyang Tobacco is a main contributor to the
company, accounting for 81 percent of its net income. With an
annual production capacity of 10 billion cigarettes, Nanyang has
built an extensive customer base in China and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Wing Fat Printing, a producer of packaging materials, has set
up nine joint ventures in China. Sunve Pharmaceutical is one of
China's leading manufacturers of healthcare products while
Shanghai Jahwa is among the country's biggest producers of
personal care and cosmetics products.
</P>
<P>
All the four factories are predicted to have growth
opportunities in the future. The chairman said that in the short
term the company will continue to focus on the manufacturing and
sales of consumer products, while in the long run it will develop
into a diversified investor in infrastructure projects and such
pillar industries as automobile and chemicals. Shanghai and the
Yangtze River Delta will remain its investment base.
</P>
<P>
The net proceeds of the share offer, expected to reach 870
million HK dollars (112 million US dollars), will be used mainly
to expand production capacity and sales network, and to fund new
projects in China.
</P>
<P>
Francis Leung, general manager of Peregrine Capital Limited,
one of the sponsors and lead managers of the share issuing, saw
Shanghai Industrial a potential Red Chip.
</P>
<P>
He said that as an old industrial base, Shanghai has advantages
in developing pillar sectors such as automobile, chemicals and
pharmaceuticals. The city enjoys a good geological position at the
Yangtze River Delta, a booming area in east China and it is
emerging as a financial hub in the country, added Leung.
</P>
<P>
Peregrine and Morgan Stanley Asia Limited are the joint global
coordinators, sponsors and lead managers of the share issuing.

<P>
Sun Fuling, visiting vice chairman of the National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
Zhang Chengli, Chinese ambassador to Pakistan, Pakistani Foreign
Minister Sardar Aseff Ahmed Ali, Secretary of the Culture Ministry
Ashad Sami Khan and diplomats from other countries attended the
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, the Pakistani foreign minister said
the relations between Pakistan and China could be an example of
setting up good relations between countries of different social
systems.
</P>
<P>
He said Pak-China relations have always been based on mutual
respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Aseff said the relationship has gone through various criticism
and pressures from different sectors and stood the test of time.
</P>
<P>
Ashad Sami Khan said, "This exhibition most aptly depicts the
historical evolution of diplomatic relations between our two
countries and their peoples during the past 45 years."
</P>
<P>
"However, the saga of Sino-Pak friendship is not a phenomenon
of merely half a century, but an epic from time immemorial."
</P>
<P>
"The rock inscriptions and other reminiscent relics of the
distant past found on the historic silk route along Karakorum
Highway bear testimony to the antiquity of bilateral relations
between our peoples," he continued.
</P>
<P>
He said the late Pakistani prime minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto,
who was then foreign minister, laid the foundation of a mutually
beneficial and solid relationship between the two countries in the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Zhang said, "For the past 45 years, with the
concerted efforts made by both governments and peoples, the
Sino-Pak friendly relations of cooperation have developed in a
sustained and steady manner."
</P>
<P>
"Our relationship has stood the test of radical changes in the
international situation and has become a model for countries with
different social systems to develop state-to-state relations."
</P>
<P>
"It is a common aspiration and basic state policy of both China
and Pakistan to further consolidate and develop the bilateral
friendly relations of cooperation," the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Sun Fuling and Aseff cut the ribbon for the photo exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan recognized the People's Republic of China on January
4, 1950 and the two countries established the diplomatic relations
on May 21, 1951.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi President Calls for National Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi President Abdur Rahman
Biswas today called for national unity for the sake of peace and
discipline in the country following the "retirement" of Chief of
Army Staff Lt. Gen. A.S.M. Nasim.
</P>
<P>
A notification from the Defense Ministry under the president
announced today that Nasim has retired from services with
immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the nation over the radio and television this
evening, Biswas said that two senior army officers were ordered to
retire from services under the Army Act and relevant rules, and
later Nasim was ordered to retire for disobeying the government
order and acting in a blatantly "insolent manner" which is
tantamount to rebellion against the government.
</P>
<P>
The president said he had discussed the entire matter with the
chief of the caretaker government, M. Habibur Rahman.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to patriotic people of all strata, political
leaders, police and other law-enforcing agencies and, above all,
the rank and file of the armed forces, to place the national
interest above personal and party interests and unite to resist
all conspiracies against the country.
</P>
<P>
"Under the constitution, the president is the
commander-in-chief of the army and the president is an elected
head of state," said Biswas.
</P>
<P>
"The responsibility of the Ministry of Defense and the armed
forces has been entrusted with the president," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Situation has been tense in Dhaka since the announcement of
Nasim's forced retirement. Witnesses said about 20 tanks and a
large number of policemen have been deployed around the
presidential palace this evening.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Ruling Party Finally Secures Majority in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's ruling New Korea Party
(NKP) finally got its majority in parliament today after
recruiting non-partisan parliamentarian Im Jin-chul.
</P>
<P>
But Im's decision to join the NKP triggered strong protests
from the opposition which has threatened to boycott the new
National Assembly due to open on June 5.
</P>
<P>
Im Jin-chul, a woman elected in the southeastern city of
Kyongju in the April 11 poll, is the latest of 11 new members of
parliament to join the NKP, which launched a recruitment drive
among independent and opposition members after only winning 139
seats in the election, 11 short of the 150 needed for a
parliamentary majority.
</P>
<P>
Her recruitment finally gave the NKP the majority it needs for
control of the one chamber 299-seat National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition parties, the National Congress for New
Politics, the Liberal Democratic Union and the Democratic Party
have condemned the NKP's tactics to secure a majority and
threatened to boycott the new parliament.

<HEADLINE> China to Report Housing Achievements to UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is all set
to report its remarkable achievements in housing construction to
the Second UN Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat 2) to be
held in Istanbul, Turkey, from June 3 to 14.
</P>
<P>
This is a global conference between governments with themes
focusing on "everyone enjoying proper housing" and "sustainable
development of human settlements amid urbanization".
</P>
<P>
According to Tan Qinglian, vice-minister of construction and
deputy head of the Chinese delegation to Habitat 2, China has paid
great attention to its participation in the UN conference and
Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua will be present at the senior
conference of Habitat 2 on behalf of the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Tan noted that China has launched a series of activities to
welcome the convening of Habitat 2, including the co-sponsorship
of a number of international symposiums on residential housing
construction, urban transportation, urban water supply and
development of small towns.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Construction and the Chinese preparatory
committee of Habitat 2 are co-sponsoring exhibitions displaying
the country's achievements in housing construction and
urbanization.
</P>
<P>
China has recommended its 14 best models in housing improvement
to the Secretariat of UN Habitat 2 and won a number of world and
UN prizes for its achievements, including the reconstruction of
post-quake Tangshan and the flood-stricken rural areas in east
China's Anhui Province, housing progress in Shenzhen and the
easing of housing shortage in Shanghai, China's largest metropolis.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister of construction added that China made
universally-recognized progress in housing construction in the 16
years between 1979 and 1995 by completing a total new housing
space of 12.9 billion sq m.
</P>
<P>
During this period China invested nearly 1.14 trillion yuan in
urban housing construction, and built 45 million apartments,
enabling almost half the country's urban residents to move into
new houses with average per capita living space hitting 7.9 sq m.
</P>
<P>
The State has paid special attention to improving housing
conditions for residents with housing difficulties, and moved nine
million households with housing difficulties into new and more
comfortable apartments between 1986 and 1995.

<P>
More noteworthy, total new housing space topping over 600
million sq m will be completed annually in the country's vast

<P>
BRUSSELS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Electricity production in the

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus Drops Two Thirds in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Japan's giant trade surplus plunged
65 percent in April and the politically sensitive surplus with the
United States also slumped by more than half due to a continued
rise in imports, the Finance Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The customs-cleared trade surplus nosedived to 320.66 billion
yen (about 3.21 billion U.S. dollars) in April from the 928.78
billion yen (about 9.29 billion dollars) surplus a year earlier,
the 17th consecutive month of decline, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Exports rose 5.1 percent to 3,644.47 billion yen (some 36.44
billion dollars), increasing for the ninth straight month, while
imports soared 30.9 percent to 3,323.82 billion yen (some 33.24
billion dollars), up for the 24th month in a row.
</P>
<P>
In particular, Japan's trade surplus with the United States
fell to 172.1 billion yen (1.72 billion dollars) from 387.82
billion yen (3.88 billion dollars), a 55.6 percent drop, propelled
by a 39.5 percent surge in imports from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The steep fall confirmed that the trade gap between Japan and
the rest of the world is being whittled away as Japan's exporters
shift production overseas and the economy becomes more
import-oriented.
</P>
<P>
Japan, an export-led economy, has habitually run a big trade
surplus, to the dismay of major trading partners such as the
United States. But the surplus has steadily been coming down as
the nation has developed a taste for cheaper imported goods and
Japanese exporters have shifted their production bases overseas to
cut costs and "re-imported" Japanese brand goods made abroad into
the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government has gone
one step further to eradicate the crippling Guinea Worm Disease
(GWD) in the country by offering a higher reward for anyone who
reports GWD cases to the authorities, the Associated Press of
Pakistan (APP) said today.
</P>
<P>
The GWD, a disabling infection transmitted through drinking
water, is characterized by a meter-long worm emerging directly
from the skin of a patient. It causes great pain and prolonged
disability and is sometimes fatal.
</P>
<P>
No GWD cases have been reported in Pakistan over the past three
years thanks to the government's anti-GWD program in collaboration
with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) that started in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Of late, Pakistan's Health Ministry proposed to increase the
reward for GWD case informers up to 30,000 rupees (865 US dollars)
each from the present 500 rupees (14.4 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The proposal has been approved by Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto, who directed the authorities concerned to take measures to
root out the disease immediately in the country.
</P>
<P>
The better incentives, to be funded by the Health Development
International of Norway, aim to facilitate Pakistan's application
for the WHO certification of eradicating GWD.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is the first country to apply for such certification
and, if duly certified, the GWD will be the second disease
eradicated in the country after small pox.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's anti-GWD program has now become a model for other
countries as the methods and strategies pioneered in Pakistan are
being applied in 17 countries for eliminating the disease.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Pakistanis suffered GWD about a decade ago when
the disease was prevalent in the country's remote rural areas,
where clean drinking water was not available and rain was the only
source of water in daily life.

<HEADLINE> New Means of Payment to Be Launched In HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong consumers will soon
use chip cards instead of cash to pay for low-value commodities
and services.
</P>
<P>
Bank of China Group (BOC), Standard Chartered Bank and Visa
International signed an agreement here today to launch the first
ever multi-purpose stored value card in Hong Kong, called Visa
Cash, in a few months.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, Zhang Hong-Yi, deputy Chief Executive
of BOC's Hongkong-Macao Regional Office, hailed the initiative of
the new payment system as a major step forward in the development
of electronic cash in the territory's retail banking industry.
</P>
<P>
Consumers can store a certain amount of money in HK dollars or
other currencies on the chip-installed cards, though how much can
be put in is not known yet. Using a chip-reading terminal, a
merchant outlet will deduct the money spent from the balance on
the stored value card.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the single purpose cash replacement cards, such as
underground railway tickets and telephone cards, Visa Cash can be
widely used in fast food chains, supermarkets, public phone
booths, convenience stores, gasoline stations, car parks, cinemas
and theaters, according to Raymond Chan, executive vice-president
of Visa International Asia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The new payment method can not only save consumers' trouble in
carrying notes and coins, but also reduce merchants' costs of
dealing in cash, added Chan.
</P>
<P>
Chan, who oversees Visa International's business in North Asia,
said that it is not only the first international stored value card
to be launched in Hong Kong, but also the first in Asia. It can be
used outside Hong Kong, so long as those places are linked to the
payment network.
</P>
<P>
Visa Cash, currently the fastest growing stored value cards in
the world, is going through an initial phase in six countries --
the United States, Canada, Spain, Australia, Argentina and
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The chip card, backed by two note-issuing banks in Hong Kong,
is expected to draw a strong response from consumers and merchant
outlets, said Nicholas Fung Ho Chung of Standard Chartered Bank,
who is in charge of smart cards business.
</P>
<P>
It is the first cooperation between BOC and Standard Chartered
Bank, with the former having an extensive banking network in China
and the latter building a banking powerhouse in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
BOC and Standard Chartered, together with Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation, are the three note issuers in Hong Kong.

</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed at

for the Tokyo Stock Exchange, gained 4.71 points, or 0. 28

</P>
<P>
On today's Tokyo Foreign Exchange, the dollar buoyed partly by
news of the substantial decline in Japan's trade surplus in April.

<P>
April's merchandise trade surplus in Japan plunged 65.5 percent
from a year earlier to 320.66 billion yen (3.21 billion dollars),

KUALA LUMPUR, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today welcomed the
proposal to make China an ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian
Nations) dialogue partner based on the country's involvement in

<HEADLINE> Chinese, British Deputy Prime Ministers Hold Talks (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
said here today that it would be hard for the World Trade
Organization (WTO) to fully play its role without China's
participation.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark while meeting with visiting British Deputy
Prime Minister Michael Heseltine here today.
</P>
<P>
China needs the WTO for its reform and opening-up process while
the WTO also needs China, Li said, adding that China's access to
the WTO would not only serve the the country's own interests, but
also help with the establishment of a stable international trade
order and the settlement of trade conflicts, as well as averting
trade wars.
</P>
<P>
Heseltine agreed with Li, saying that Britain is in favor of
free trade and will support China to become a member of the WTO at
an early date.
</P>
<P>
Referring to bilateral ties, Li noted that Sino-British
relations has been improved through the joint efforts of both
sides over the past year. A good momentum which has been rarely
seen in recent years has emerged, he said, hoping that the two
sides would continue to maintain this momentum.

<P>
During the talks, Li briefed Heseltine on China's Ninth
Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and its long-term objectives to the
year 2010.
</P>
<P>
China's population will reach 1.3 billion by the end of the
century, giving the issue of grain top priority, Li continued,
saying that China takes agriculture as its first priority for
development and will continue to strengthen the construction of
infrastructure, energy, transportation and communications.
</P>
<P>
Britain has advantages for helping China in the key fields of
economic development, and the co-operation between the two sides
has broad prospects, Li told his British counterpart.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the hope that the British side would take a more
positive attitude toward its investment in China and the transfer
of technology to the country.
</P>
<P>
The two deputy prime ministers also exchanged views about the
cooperation on some specific items.
</P>
<P>
Heseltine told Li that he was pleased to visit China again. He
expressed his admiration for China's great economic achievements
and his pleasure at the obvious increase in high-level exchanges
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During his China tour last year, there were 125 British
entrepreneurs in his entourage, while this time the number has
risen to 270, which shows that the British government attaches
great importance to the development of its ties with China,
Heseltine noted.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the issue of Hong Kong, Li said that the leaders of
the two countries have exchanged views on the issue many times
over the past year. The two sides have increased their
co-operation concerning the Hong Kong issue and have made new
progress on some specific issues.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the two sides would further boost
their co-operation to realize a smooth transition and transfer of
the power in Hong Kong. This conforms to the interests of the two
countries, Li added.
</P>
<P>
Heseltine agreed with Li on this point.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Li and Heseltine met with some British
entrepreneurs, and Li answered their questions.
</P>
<P>
At noon today Shi Guangsheng, vice-minister of Foreign Trade
and Economic Co-operation, held talks with Heseltine, who arrived
here last Saturday for a visit as guest of his Chinese
counterpart.

<HEADLINE> More Tourists Visit Egypt in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's tourism industry continued to
pick up as 326,841 tourists visited the North African country in
March this year, an increase of 33.5 percent over the same month
of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette, Egypt's sole English-language daily,
reported today that 244,888 tourists came to Egypt in March last
year.
</P>
<P>
The country's tourism, which had suffered a slump since 1992
largely because of a violent campaign launched by Islamic
militants against the government, greatly recovered last year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3.133 million tourists visited Egypt in 1995,
recording an increase of 21.4 percent over 1994, according to the
Tourism Ministry.
</P>
<P>
This big number of tourists was attributed to the improved
security situation in the country and a huge international
advertizing campaign launched by the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is one of the main sources of Egypt's foreign currency
income.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is especially famous for its monuments left over from the
Pharaonic era, mild weather in winter, unpolluted sand beaches
along the Red Sea coast and religious sites.
</P>
<P>
However, Tourism Minister Mamdouh el-Beltagui has warned that
the killing of 17 Greek tourists in Cairo last month might have a
passive impact on Egypt's tourism in the upcoming season, The
Egyptian Gazette said.
</P>
<P>
On April 18, gunmen opened fire on a group of Greek tourists
and killed 17 of them outside the Europa Hotel near the pyramids.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gamaa al-Islamiya (the Islamic Group), Egypt's largest
Islamic militant group, later claimed responsibility for the
attack, saying that it had mistaken the victims for Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The group said that the attack was aimed at avenging
Israel's bombardments of south Lebanon.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
today lauded an agreement reached between Yemen and Eritrea on
settling their dispute over a group of Red Sea islands through
international arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, who left here today for Paris to attend the signing of
the agreement covering the principles of that arbitration, said
before departure that he hopes the accord would pave way for a
peaceful settlement to the Yemeni-Eritrean dispute over the Hanish
islands.
</P>
<P>
He said that France had played a pivotal role in reaching the
arbitration accord.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean and Yemeni foreign ministers will sign the accord
in Paris Tuesday. The signing ceremony will also be attended by
the foreign ministers of France and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the Red Sea islands flared up last December
when the two sides had a fierce battle and Eritrean forces took
over Greater Hanish, the largest of the disputed islands, before a
cease-fire took effect.
</P>
<P>
The islands sit astride major shipping lanes 160 kilometers
north of the Strait of Bab el-Mandeb at the mouth of the Red
Sea. Yemen and Eritrea face each other across the strait.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Ethiopia as well as France have been trying to mediate a
peaceful settlement to the dispute.

<HEADLINE> Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong plays a significant
role as the fund management center in the Asia-Pacific region,
according to an annual survey released today by the Hong Kong
Investment Funds Association (HKIFA).
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 36 fund companies or 90 percent of the
total used Hong Kong as their Asia-Pacific regional headquarters.
All the HKIFA member fund companies managed total assets of 94.2
billion US dollars by the end of 1995, with 70 percent coming from
overseas sources.
</P>
<P>
The figures reflect the importance of Hong Kong as the regional
fund management center, said Andrew Lo, chairman of HKIFA.
</P>
<P>
Although Japan and Singapore are two common locations where
fund companies choose to set up offices, Hong Kong remains the
regional forefront for most global investment funds.
</P>
<P>
Nearly a quarter of the total assets, or 22.2 billion US
dollars were invested in the Hong Kong stock market, says the
survey. There are various forms of investment funds in the
territory, such as unit trusts, pensions, non-pensions
institutional funds, closed-end funds and private clients funds.
</P>
<P>
The fund management industry employed some 1,600 staff, with 25
percent being investment professionals.
</P>
<P>
The survey gives an optimistic outlook for Hong Kong's fund
management sector despite the challenges from other Asian
economies, which relax the rules governing the fledgling industry
and offer more opportunities and incentives.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong the Mandatory Provident Fund Scheme, the growth of
the middle class and the awareness of the means of investment will
greatly expand the local client base, said the HKIFA chairman. It
is estimated that merely three percent of the local population now
get involved in investment funds.
</P>
<P>
Lo added that institutional investors, attracted by the growing
opportunities in the Asian market, would pour more overseas
capital into the region.

<HEADLINE> TB Becomes Serious in Vietnam, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hanoi, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Tuberculosis (TB) is becoming an
increasingly serious problem in Vietnam, with 25,000 people dying
of the disease a year, an official report said today.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Viet Co, head of the National Tuberculosis Prevention
Committee, was quoted as saying that 130,000 people were infected
every year. Of the annual total, 45 percent are diagnosed and
treated, while the rest live in their communities without
proper and prompt treatment.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's infection rate is currently higher than other
Asia-Pacific countries, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Between 0.02 and 0.06 percent of children are infected with
tuberculosis every year in the country, said the report, adding
that up to 38 percent of the children being treated at the
tuberculosis and lung disease hospitals have a particular strain
of the disease, the one which leads to tuberculous meningitis.
</P>
<P>
A further serious problem is the fact that HIV/Aids sufferers
are very susceptible to tuberculosis. According to a local
tuberculosis and lung disease hospital, 20 out of 40 HIV carriers
are suffering from tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
Confronting the serious problem, Vietnam has set it a target to
reduce tuberculosis cases by a full 70 percent this year.
However, a shortage of staff and equipment make it harder for the
nation's anti-tuberculosis efforts.

ceasefire in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"This violation is not the first, nor will it be the last," the
Syrian newspaper Al-Baath, mouthpiece of the ruling party, said
in its editorial today.
</P>
<P>
Israel is seeking to explode the situation anew with the aim
of dropping the April understanding and evading executing it, and
it is putting pressure on Lebanon to joint the peace process
though the blood of victims of the Qana massacre in south Lebanon
has not dried up yet, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire understanding reached by Israel and lebanon in
April that ended the 16-day Israeli operation in south Lebanon
bans firing from or at civilian targets on both sides of the
border.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Israeli shelling of some villages and towns
in south Lebanon Sunday, the Syrian newspaper Teshreen said that
Israel has breached the April understanding, and it does so
intentionally at a time when the states concerned have not
finished their Washington meetings on forming a committee to
monitor the execution of the items of that understanding.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the recent Israeli attacks on Lebanon revealed
that Israel is still dealing with south Lebanon and its residents
with a mentality of aggression, hatred and terrorism.

<P>
TEHRAN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran's unemployment rate stood

respectively, from 1991-1992.
</P>
<P>
The official annual inflation rate stands at 50 percent,

<HEADLINE> Removal of Trade Barriers in West Africa Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 20 (Xinhua) - The Chief of west Africa's trade bloc
has urged for the removal of various trade barriers to step up the
process of economic integration in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
In a press release that was reached here today, Edouard
Benjamin, Executive Secretary of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS), said frequent shifts of economic
policies, puck of foreign exchange controls and unpredictable
business environment, have hindered trade expansion and
sustainable growth in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
In his paper entitled ''Trade Barries in the ECOWAS
Sub-region: the Way Out'', Benjamin called for urgent policy
measures to be put in place to address the obstacles.
</P>
<P>
He listed seven steps taken by his Sectretariat in making
ECOWAS regional currencies more convertible, including
recommending a single monetary zone as well as restructuring of
the West African Monetary Agency (WAMA).
</P>
<P>
These measures, which would involve the elimination of
distortions in exchange rates and the adoption of adjustment
measures to facilitate harmonization of monetary and fiscal
policies, are aimed at improving the payment system in west
Africa, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1975, ECOWAS has made notable progress in
building up infrastructure in the region and promoting the
intra-community trade.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS chief also urged for the political will of the
leaders of the region in the way leading to a sub-regional trade
bloc.
</P>
<P>
To step up the regional integration process, a ''Two Speed
West Africa'' is being implemented which means bigger economies in
the region will go ahead of others to form a free trade zone to
spearhead the economic integration of the whole region.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, heads of state and government of the 16 ECOWAS member
countries reached an agreement to set up a customs union by the
year of 2000 and a comprehensive economic union by 2005.

<HEADLINE> New Trial Session of Former South Korean Presidents Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Seoul District Court held here
today a new session to try former South Korean Presidents Chun
Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo as well as a number of Chun's former
aides on charges of mutiny and treason.
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions from the defense, Chun testified that
the investigation in late 1979 of then acting President Choi
Kyu-hah in connection with President Park Chung-hee's
assassination had been conducted on the orders of then Martial Law
Commander Chung Seung-hwa.
</P>
<P>
Standing trial at the court were Chun and Roh as well as Chun's
11 close aides, including Hwang Young-shi, former first army corps
commander.
</P>
<P>
Chun claimed that the investigation of Choi had nothing to do
with him and his joint investigation office since it was conducted
by an army prosecutor following Chung's orders.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chung ordered army prosecutors to investigate
whether Choi was involved in Park's assassination and that the
military prosecutor in charge of the assassination case met him at
his joint investigation office and asked him to cooperate in the
investigation of Choi.
</P>
<P>
Chun explained that he reported it to Choi and obtained his
consent to be investigated, and army prosecutor Chun Chang-yol
questioned Choi on December 1, 1979.
</P>
<P>
The ex-president also testified that he ordered his senior
investigator Lee Hak-bong and others to question Martial Law
Commander Chung in connection with Park's assassination on October
29, 1979.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16 former South Korean army officers including Chun
Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo have been indicted for mutiny and
treason. The mutiny and treason charges respectively stem from
their roles in the military revolt on December 12, 1979 and in the
bloody crackdown of the civil uprising on May 18, 1980 in Kwangju,
capital of South Korea's South Cholla Province.
</P>
<P>
Chun Doo-whan, who loomed large as the army strongman after the
1979 military mutiny, seized power on August 27, 1980, and ruled
the country until February 1988. He was followed by Roh Tae-woo
who stepped down in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
The two former presidents, who were arrested last year, have
also been indicted for graft charges as they received huge bribes
from businessmen while in office, in addition to the mutiny and
treason charges.
</P>
<P>
Both Chun and Roh have already stood trial three times each
separately on the graft charges.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urged to Withdraw Troops from Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi government has urged the
Turkish government to immediately withdraw all its troops
stationed in northern Iraq for the cross-border operations to
fight against the rebels of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
According to a statement faxed to Xinhua Ankara Office by
the Iraqi Embassy here this morning, an Iraqi Foreign Ministry
spokesman said that Turkey must stop the repeating of the
operations which contradict the Turkish official statements about
the respect of the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity
of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi statement came in response to a statement issued by
the Turkish Foreign Ministry on May 9 to the effect that Turkey is
concerned about security because of the PKK terrorists, so it has
the right to enter the northern Iraq to confront the PKK rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman expressed great sorrow over the Turkish
statement which did not explain the fact that it violated
the Iraqi airspace and territories.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that the Turkish government troops
continuously shelled the Iraqi towns and villages, causing
damages to Iraqi Kurdish citizens.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has continuously staged cross-border military operations
in a bid to wipe out the PKK rebels based in northern Iraq, who
often attack military and civilian targets in southeastern Turkey
bordering Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkish troops killed more than 60 PKK rebels in southeastern
province of Batman in one of the largest recent losses for the
PKK in a single clash, Turkish official sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Over 20,000 people, including PKK rebels, government troops
and civilians, have been killed in armed conflicts between the
Turkish security forces and the PKK, which has been fighting for
self-rule in southeastern Turkey since August 1984.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong and Macao Can Share China's Inland's Reform Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- China's opening market in the
country's long term economic plans will provide a new driving
force for Hong Kong and Macao businesses, a leading official said
today.
</P>
<P>
Guo Dongpo, president of China Council for the Promotion of
International Trade, noted that investors from Hong Kong and Macao
will have the opportunity to invest in China's key industries and
projects.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) will have a profound
influence on the economy of Hong Kong and Macao, said Guo.
</P>
<P>
It means new opportunities and challenges for Hong Kong and
Macao investors, he added.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, he said that although the Ninth
Five-Year Plan and the Long-term Target for the Year 2010 do not
cover Hong Kong and Macao, they will both benefit from the rapid
economic development and reform on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the trade volume between the mainland and
Hong Kong amounted to 854.7 billion Hong Kong dollars in 1994, up
by 78 times over that in 1978.
</P>
<P>
While the Hong Kong's entrepot trade from the mainland in 1995
also topped 868.7 billion Hong Kong dollars-worth, accounting for
ninety percent of its total, and up by more than 200 times
compared with 1978.
</P>
<P>
The mainland has become Hong Kong's biggest market and goods
supplier, he concluded.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong investment in the mainland has also been increasing
rapidly, Guo noted, adding that its investment has already ranked
the first, and constitutes 60 percent of the total overseas
investment there.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China-funded enterprises in Hong Kong and Macao also
take an active part in the investment there. Their capital scale
has taken the lead among overseas investments.
</P>
<P>
As China's increasing foreign trade in the Ninth Five-Year Plan
period still needs Hong Kong as a transit base, he pointed out,
more opportunities will be provided to the more than 100,000
foreign trade companies there.
</P>
<P>
The opening market in the mainland will also bring new driving
force for Hong Kong's products, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong investors can participate in the investment of
key industries and projects, and the tertiary industry in the
mainland is also in fine prospect, he added.
</P>
<P>
As China will adjust its industrial structure and change its
mode of economic growth in the Ninth Five-Year Plan period, Hong
Kong investors will also be confronted with new challenges, he
said.
</P>
<P>
They should therefore adopt appropriate ways to deal with the
changing situation, stablizing their markets in the east while
exploring the markets in the central and west part of China, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
To this end, he said his council will continue to promote
economic exchanges between the mainland and Hong Kong and Macao,
and maintain their prosperity and stability.

<HEADLINE> Israel Tries to Ease Strained Ties with Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres held consultations with his top aides Sunday night on what
steps should be taken to ease the strains in relations with Jordan
that have developed in the past few months, particularly during
the 17-day military offensive against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post reported today that among those at the
meeting was Israeli Ambassador to Jordan Shimon Shamir who has
repeatedly in his cables warned the Foreign Ministry about the
impact of recent events upon Jordanian public opinion.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Ambassador to Israel Omar Rifai recently said, "Over
the last few months, a shadow has been cast on our relations with
Israel, including the closure of the West Bank and Operation
Grapes of Wrath. The average Jordanians also want to see more
economic benefits as a result of peace, and public opinion is
impatient."
</P>
<P>
But Rifai repeatedly voiced optimism that bilateral relations
will grow. "I think the clouds will pass, and everything will
return to normal," he said.
</P>
<P>
While Jordanians deny that King Hussein is upset with Peres, he
declined an invitation to meet with Peres and U.S. President Bill
Clinton in Washington last month. Furthermore, while Peres wanted
to visit Amman last week as a pre-election illustration of the
bilateral friendship, Jordan withheld the invitation.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that King Hussein declined to appear with Peres
both times to maintain neutrality between the two Israeli rival
parties of Labor and the Likud.
</P>
<P>
In addition to anger at the Israeli Operation Grapes of Wrath
in south Lebanon, Jordan has been disappointed at the lack of
trade. As it stands now, one of the only Israeli businesses in
Jordan is a Delta underwear factory in Irbid.
</P>
<P>
While about 130,000 Israeli tourists visited Jordan last year,
accounting for 10 percent of all the foreign tourists to Jordan,
Jordanians have complained that Israelis visit Petra and quickly
return, spending virtually no money in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Jordanians say that international funding for dams on
the Yarmuk, called for in the peace treaty, has yet to
materialize.
</P>
<P>
Asher Susser, an expert on Jordan at Tel Aviv University's
Dayan Center for Middle East Studies, predicted that the two sides
would work together to resolve the issues, and relations would
back on track once political leaders here are no longer
preoccupied with the elections.
</P>
<P>
More than 160 Lebanese civilians were killed and some 400
others wounded during the Israeli Operation Grapes of Wrath in
south Lebanon last month before a cease-fire understanding was
reached on April 26.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait, Iran Agree to Boost Friendly Relationship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait and Iran have agreed on
the need to bolster mutual confidence and overcome differences
through dialogue, exchange of visits and re-asserting the policy
of non-intervention in each other's home affairs.
</P>
<P>
This was expressed by Kuwaiti Parliamentary Speaker Ahmad
al-Saadoun and Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati during
their official talks Sunday in Tehran. The Kuwaiti speaker is on
a three-day official visit to Iran, which will end today.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Official sources said here today that al-Saadoun
praised improvement of the Kuwaiti-Iranian relations, especially
in the parliamentary arena, while Velayati was reported as saying
that "we believe that Iran and Kuwait agree on the importance of
boosting their cooperation not only on the bilateral level, but on
the international and collective ones."
</P>
<P>
Al-Saadoun praised the current relations between the two
countries and described them as an example to be followed among
countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti sources described the talks as "positive, fruitful,
candid and very frank."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian parliamentary speaker, who invited al-Saadoun to
Iran for the official visit, said there were no problems in
the brotherly relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Both speakers stressed on the necessity of exploiting the
current available chances to bolster the bilateral trade and
economic relations.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have seen a remarkable development in
their friendly relationship during the past several years in
various fields, especially since the beginning of last year.
</P>
<P>
They have been striving to extend their joint cooperation
to include all spheres in the governmental and parliamentary
arenas.
</P>
<P>
More than 10 ministerial and parliamentary delegations have
been exchanged between the two countries. The two way trade volume

<HEADLINE> b d p 2511 China-Personality Test Chinese Take Noisy, Busy, Hectic Lives in Their Stride - Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Experts in China have compared the
lives of people in get-rich Guangzhou, capital of south China's
Guangdong Province, with poorer Xi'an city, capital of northwest
China's Shaanxi Province, and Wengyuan County, a remote village in
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
They wanted to determine whether the stresses and strains of
living in a fast-pace, crowded and noisy city caused psychological
problems.
</P>
<P>
Their conclusion is that it has not affected people in the
booming south China city.
</P>
<P>
In fact the test shows that the Guangzhou respondents, compared
to their economically less developed counterparts in Xi'an and
Wengyuan, have more positive personal attributes which are
conductive to better interpersonal relationship, social
adjustment, and emotional stability.
</P>
<P>
They tend to be more flexible in problem solving and gracious
in their interpersonal relationships, exhibiting less
psychological distress associated with emotional and behaviour
problems, including Antisocial Behavior, Anxiety, Sexual
Maladjustment, Paranoia, and Pathological Dependence.
</P>
<P>
The detailed test, which compared samples from the two Chinese
cities and one village, failed to demonstrate that economic
development is related to more psychological distress.
</P>
<P>
The results, however, indicate that economic improvement
associated with development would lead to better quality of life
and a more satisfying life.
</P>
<P>
The test was jointly conducted by the Institute of Psychology
affiliated to the Chinese Academy of Science and the Department of
Psychology under the Chinese University of Hong Kong, in three
locations varying in the degree of economic development in China.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that noise, pollution, and crowdedness,
resulting from rapid economic development taking place in China,
are still not capable of imposing a considerable impact on, or
have not been sensed by ordinary Chinese citizens, at a time when
China is still a less modern and industrialized society.
</P>
<P>
However, rapid economic development has brought about obvious
improvements in aspects of material life, education and employment.
</P>
<P>
In addition, with publicity on psychological knowledge and the
establishment of numerous psychological advisory institutes,
residents in more developed regions tend to better adapted to the
ever changing society, and be less subject to psychological
distress.

<HEADLINE> British Deputy PM At Sino-UK Aerospace Industry Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- British Deputy Prime Minister
Michael Heseltine expressed his hope today that Britain and
China would increase their cooperation in the aerospace industry.
</P>
<P>
He told a Sino-UK aerospace industry forum in Beijing that as
Britain has a complete modern aviation production industry, and
China's aerospace market is enjoying rapid development with a
great potential, the cooperation between the two countries would
be beneficial to both.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Yuli, president of the Aviation Industries of China (AVIC),
said at the forum that long-term and friendly Sino-British
cooperation in aerospace has yielded significant fruits.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is undergoing smooth negotiations with
aircraft manufacturers of Britain, France and Italy on developing
China's 100-seater regional aircrafts project.
</P>
<P>
It is possible that the B2715 air engine jointly made by
Britain's Rolls-Royce and Germany's BMW would be selected as the
engine of the project, he added.
</P>
<P>
Before attending the forum sponsored by AVIC and the Society of
British Aerospace Companies, Heseltine and Zhu were also present
at a press conference at which the establishment of a
joint-venture between Xi'an Aero Engine Company (XAE ) under AVIC
and Rolls-Royce was announced.
</P>
<P>
The new company will produce aerofoils for Rolls-Royce's air
engines, becoming the single source supplier for the casting and
machining of components for Rolls-Royce's latest engines.
</P>
<P>
The joint-venture will generate 20 million US dollars from
export sales each year after it begins full operation in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Australian Government Reaffirms Balanced Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Australian Finance Minister John
Fahey today rejected suggestions that the government's plan to cut
8 billion Australian dollars (6 billion US dollars) in spending
from the budget within two years would slow down the economy and
increase unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question raised by Jackie Kelly of the Labor Party,
Fahey told parliament that "the government believes that tighter
fiscal policy is conducive to higher and not lower employment and
that view is respected by many authorities."
</P>
<P>
The question of cutting the budget deficit has remained one of
the focal points of debate in the parliament and media since the
Howard Government announced in March that it would cut 8 billion
dollars from the budget in the next two years "to deliver an
underlying balanced budget in 1997-98".
</P>
<P>
Those, who are opposed to the plan, argued that the plan to
slash 8 billion in budget spending could lead to higher
unemployment and make it more difficult to obtain a budget
surplus.
</P>
<P>
Three professors of economics from Australian universities
today issued a letter to the public saying the deficit was about
half the eight billion dollar forecast and warned that
expectations that the economy would grow more slowly made it
"neither necessary nor desirable" to cut spending.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, the academics said that based on the treasury's
forecast of 3.5 percent growth during the next two years the
Australian economy was running between 1.5 and two percent below
capacity.
</P>
<P>
If it were at full capacity, that alone would reduce the
starting point deficit for 1996-97 by about a half. This means the
underlying cyclically adjusted deficit is closer to 4 billion
rather than 8 billion.
</P>
<P>
"If the economy is indeed slowing down, such a policy may well
slow it down further and increase unemployment in the short-term,
while helping neither the fiscal deficit nor the national savings
rate," the letter noted.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister repeated the government's assurance that
tackling the budget deficit would improve the environment for
easing interest rates.

<HEADLINE> New Rail Switch to Help Speed up Major Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, May 20 (Xinhua) -- China has successfully developed a
new type of railway points switch of international standards which
will help raise speeds on major railways.
</P>
<P>
The switch points were successfully tried on the Kunshan
section of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, is capable of
accommodating trains running at 160 km per hour, as against the
commonly-used 110-km speed and the improved 140-km speed
capacities.
</P>
<P>
The new product, which was a key project of the Ministry of
Railways during the eighth Five-Year-Plan (1992-1995), is in
concrete and is seamless, enabling stableness and strong
anti-shock capacity, as compared with the traditional wooden
points with seams, experts said.
</P>
<P>
All the existing switches on the Shanghai-Nanjing railway are
expected to be replaced by the new points this year, shortening
the present travel time by over 18 minutes.
</P>
<P>
New technology so far introduced has already helped raise
speeds on the 311-km-long railway, shortening the journey time by
more than two hours to less than three hours.

<HEADLINE> China to Enlarge Dujiangyan Irrigated Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, May 20 (Xinhua)-- China will launch a large scale
reconstruction project to enlarge the irrigated area of
Dujiangyan, China's oldest irrigation system, in southwestern
Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
Through reconstruction, the irrigated area of Dujiangyan will
increase to 930,000 ha from today's 660,000 ha, according to the
Bureau of Administration of Dujiangyan.
</P>
<P>
Located 55 kilometers from Chengdu, capital of Sichuan
province, the Dujiangyan has a history of more than 2,250 years
and is the largest irrigated area in the country.
</P>
<P>
Peng Shuming, director of the bureau, says the reconstruction
will include a large reservoir on the Minjiang river, seven
kilometers away from the headwork of the Dujiangyan, and a series
of canals.
</P>
<P>
Peng said that the construction of the project is expected to
start next year, adding that overseas investment will be welcomed
as the total investment is expected to reach seven to eight
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
To enlarge the irrigated area, the country will draw water from
Pihe river, a main canal of the irrigation system, on to 200,000
ha of arable land on the little hills.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a series of main and branch canals will be
constructed and reconstructed to ensure that water can be smoothly
sent to arable land.
</P>
<P>
The whole irrigation system of Dujiangyan is composed of a
headwork project and canals of various levels. The headwork
consists of three principal engineering works, namely, Yuzui (the
fish-mouth pier), Feishayan (the sand-flying spillway) and
Baopinkou (the precious vase-tap sluiceway).
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the durability of the Dujiangyan to the
appropriate locality, ingenious design and regular annual
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
When the People's Republic was founded in 1949, the irrigated
area of the Dujiangyan covered 130,000 ha of arable land in 12
counties. With the construction of some 20,000-kilometer-long
canals of various levels, hundreds of water power stations and
more than 300 reservoirs, the irrigated area has increased to more
than 660,000 ha of arable land in 34 counties.
</P>
<P>
The Dujiangyan irrigated area is now a key production base of
commercial grains, oil-bearing crops, meat and vegetables. The
multiple crop index in the area reached 280 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, its supply of water also serves the multiple
interests of agriculture, industry, urban life, water power
stations, aquatic products industry, environmental protection and
tourism.

in poverty-stricken areas in central and west China.
</P>
<P>
It will mean thousands of poor parents being able to send their
children to school.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Yongjiu, an official with the State Education Committee
(SEC) recommended the program at an on-going international seminar
on primary and secondary school education in the 21st century,
held in Kunming, the capital of southwest China's Yunnan province,
in which over 100 experts and scholars from United States,
Britain, Germany, Japan and Canada are participating.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that by the year 2000, three billion yuan
contributed by the central government and seven-billion yuan from
governments at other levels will be used to help develop education
in 590 poor counties in the region.
</P>
<P>
The funds under the program will be injected into designated
education projects only, and governments at all levels should
establish a management system and take concrete measures to ensure
an efficient use of the money.
</P>
<P>
Jiang added that both the economy and education are backward in
central and west China. In some poverty-stricken mountainous areas
and minority nationality regions, many children lose their
education opportunities because they cannot even afford several
yuan tuition fees.
</P>
<P>
The country's long-term plan has designated the western part of
China a key region to promote the economy and culture in
future. The provincial governments should make strong efforts to
train a group of qualified people to meet the demands of economic
development and social progress, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
The coastal provinces and cities in the east should help the
development of education in the west, Jiang said, citing the
cooperation between Shanghai and Yunnan as a good model.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Financial Institutions Getting Higher Returns in Shenzhen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen is making efforts to open
yuan-denominated business to foreign financial institutions as
soon as possible, a senior local official said.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen, a special economic zone in south China's Guangdong
Province, is paying much attention to improving the investment
environment, said deputy mayor Wu Jiesi.
</P>
<P>
"The municipal government has urged relevant departments to
build a better management climate for foreign enterprises and
financial institutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Twenty six foreign financial institutions operating in Shenzhen
reported more than 50 million US dollars in profits last year,
accounting for nearly 40 percent of the total for foreign
financial institutions operating in China.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen is playing host to 52 foreign financial institutions,
whose assets topped four billion US dollars, or 20 percent of the
total across the country, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Their outstanding loans exceeded three billion US dollars, with
deposits at more than 600 million US dollars at the end of last
year.
</P>
<P>
"The high profits indicates that foreign financial institutions
are wise to invest in Shenzhen," said Wu.

<HEADLINE> Real Estate Sector in China Reaps High Profit Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to invest 236
billion yuan on the construction of commodity housing in the
coming five years.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Construction Hou Jie said that a huge market
potential exists for ordinary residential housing in China - with
profits higher than in western countries.
</P>
<P>
Hou said there is a ratio between the price of housing and the
annual income of families, which ranges roughly between 3 to 1 and
6 to 1.
</P>
<P>
People can only afford to buy homes within the ratio. The
commodity housing market will slump if the housing price goes six
times beyond the annual income of a household, Hou said in a
report in today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The minister made it clear that there is a sharp contrast
between the residents' low income and the high housing price in
China, which climbs to 7,000 or 9,000 yuan per sq m of floor space
in big cities such as Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that the country's real estate market is
restrained by a series of factors including the unpopular practise
of installments and mortgage-backed loans.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said that the country's real estate
sector reaps a higher profit rate than the world's average, even
of advanced countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the average profit rate in the international real
estate markets stands at 6 to 8 percent, while in China it is
about 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he added, even in recent years when China's real
estate market has been in a slight depressed state, its average
profit rate hangs around 20 to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
More noteworthy, the profit rate of "comfortable housing
projects", the lowest in the real estate sector, stands around 15
percent, much higher than that of other industries.

<HEADLINE> Thai Navy Still Pushes for Submachine Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Thai Navy has not given
up hope of acquiring diesel attack submarines, trying to get at
least one first.
</P>
<P>
Navy Deputy Command-in-Chief Adm. Vineyard Santivisat said the
navy would not end its efforts to convince Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-Archa to allow it to buy the first submarine with a
five-year tied-over fund of 7.5 billion baht (300 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The navy earlier planned to buy two submarines at a total cost
of 17 billion baht (680 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Budget Bureau recently informed the navy of its decision to
suspend the submarine acquisition plan, citing financial
constraints and heavy current account deficit the country is
facing.
</P>
<P>
If the procurement plan is delayed for another year, the price
of the submarines would surely rise. By then two submarines may
increase from 17 billion baht to 20 billion baht (800 million
dollars), the Bangkok Post today quotes Vineyard as saying.

<HEADLINE> More Beijing Students Apply to Join Communist Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Students' zeal for joining the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and studying communist theory is
high in Beijing's colleges and universities, according to a local
report.
</P>
<P>
At Beijing University, one of China's leading academies, 473
students and 41 faculty members became CPC members last year, 239
more than the figure for 1994, the "Beijing Daily" reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Another 2,356 students have applied to join the Party,
the highest figure for many years, the report quoted Ren
Yanshen, secretary of the university's CPC Committee, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The number of students who attend Party lectures every
weekend has risen to 1,875, twice the figure for 1994, Ren said.
</P>
<P>
He said the student Communist Party members usually have high
political consciousness and good academic performance. Many of
them are also members of a volunteer society of the school.
</P>
<P>
At the Capital Economics and Trade University, classes at a
newly-opened Party school is often filled with students, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Students at the Party school study the theories of
Marxism-Leninism, the history of the CPC and Deng Xiaoping's
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
"Because of their outstanding performance, the student Party
members are generally preferred and welcomed by employers when
they look for jobs, which to some extent encourages college
students to join the Party," the report said.

SHIJIAZHUANG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- China has become a world giant

He has been commissioned to carefully carve pictures of some of
the world's best known statesmen.
</P>
<P>
The skill has earned Qin Dayin the official title of
"Folk Artist and Handicraftsman".
</P>
<P>
The title was bestowed on Qin by the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization and China Society for the
Study of Folk Literature and Art.
</P>
<P>
Qin, a teacher of the Kunming Science and Engineering
University in southwest China's Yunnan Province, won the accolade
for his "outstanding achievements in the protection, inheritance,
and innovation of folk culture."
</P>
<P>
"It has been nearly a decade since I started to learn by myself
to carve on porcelain, a hobby that has almost taken all my spare
time," the 50-year-old Qin recalled.
</P>
<P>
It requires high craftsmanship to carve a painting of landscape
or of birds and flowers, a piece of poem in Chinese calligraphy,
or the image of some celebrity onto a ceramic dish, which has only
limited space, he noted.
</P>
<P>
To form his own style, he learned widely and drew much
experience from traditional Chinese painting, sculpture, and
prints. Still, there were numerous setbacks before he attained
a perfect grasp with the carving knife and found the way to add
distinctive charm to his works.
</P>
<P>
Carving on a large variety of subjects, he is especially
reputed for his vivid reproduction of the images of famous Chinese
and foreign historical figures, ranging from Confucius and
Sakyamuni, founders of Confucianism and Buddhism, to the late
Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai.
</P>
<P>
With a rising fame in and out of China, he often receives
invitations to carve on porcelain, images of foreign celebrities,
such as Bhumibol Adulyadej, King of Thailand, Chatichai
Choonhavan, former Prime Minister of Thailand, and Lee Kuan Yew,
former Prime Minister of Singapore.

When World War II veterans of the U.S. 14th Air Fleet, who
under the command of General Claire Lee Chennault fought in
China's years of fierce battles against the Japanese invaders,
revisited their wartime base Kunming in 1991, Qin was asked by the
local aviation society to carve a gift for the American guests.
</P>
<P>
The pilots were fascinated at the first sight of his gift, a
pair of ceramic dishes with delicate carving of winged tigers, a
sweet reminiscence of their glorious days in China, when they were
nicknamed "the flying tigers" for their courageous and outstanding
performance in the air.
</P>
<P>
"I got the inspiration from some ancient eave tiles of the Han
Dynasty (206 B.C.- A.D. 220) that bear similar designs," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
Today, Qin's works can be found in government or private
collections in Britain, France, Germany, the United States,
Thailand, South Africa, Singapore, and Japan, as well as in Hong

But his own favorite is a piece of painting-calligraphy carving
he made last year to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of

starry sky and titled "Zhi Li Wei Gong", which means "work hard
for public interests", the party's slogan, the piece is now kept

<P>
Qin's family tree shows that he is a descendent of Qin Guan, a
famous poet of the Song Dynasty (960-1279) who lived 33
generations ago.
</P>
<P>
he said he is proud of his ancestors, but did not say whether
his own artistic talents can be related to the heredity of the
famous ancestral poet.

"Fame is nothing to me, and there is no end for artistic
pursuits," he claimed when asked about his feeling toward success

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Up 12.3 Pc in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's total trade rose by
12.3 percent in April on a three-month moving average basis, as
both non-oil and oil trade recorded double-digit growth rates, The
Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic exports rose steadily by 9.5 percent while
re-exports grew by 10 percent. Oil trade rose by 28.1 percent, it
said.
</P>
<P>
On a monthly basis, the TDB said that non-oil domestic exports
registered a higher growth of 14 percent in April this year as
compared to the 9 percent in the previous month, while re-exports
continued to grow steadily by 12.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The 9.5 percent growth in non-oil domestic exports, which
reached around 5.2 billion US dollars, came largely from strong
demand for electronics and related products, mainly in the US and
Japanese markets which recorded double-digit growth rates of 19.3
percent and 27.5 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The TDB projected that non-oil domestic exports to the United
States might moderate in the latter half of the year as demand for
electronic products such as semi-conductors is expected to soften.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, it said growth in the Japanese market was
likely to remain strong as the recovery of the Japanese economy is
expected to continue.
</P>
<P>
Domestic exports of oil grew by 28.1 percent in April to reach
about 1.1 billion US dollars, after expanding by 22.5 percent in
the preceding month. The volume of oil exports surged by 15.7
percent as demand from Hong Kong for subsequent re-export to China
remained strong, the TDB said.
</P>
<P>
Re-exports increased by 10 percent to about 4.2 billion US
dollars in April, largely as a result of increases in the demand
for computer parts and peripherals, integrated circuits, disk
drives, radios and parts, and other products.
</P>
<P>
Imports, on the other hands, increased by 13.2 percent to about
11.1 billion US dollars in April. The growth was largely
contributed by imports of computer parts and peripherals, disk
drives, blank computer tapes and discs, integrated circuits, parts
of TVs and radios, and other products, the TDB said.

others in the village of Shanthiveli, 10 kms North of Batticaloa
town, two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Security sources here said that the LTTE did not have the
support of the public, who are now providing the police and the
government troops with detailed information about the LTTE
activities.
</P>
<P>
The sources believed that as a result of increased public
vigilance and government forces operations, there was a lull in
the LTTE activity in the Batticaloa district.

<HEADLINE> 23 Institutes Win Bids for Major Farm Research Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-three agricultural
institutes have won China's first public bidding for 16 farming
technology research projects to help boost food output in the 21st
century. The work will involve the growing of rice, wheat, corn,
soybean and cotton.
</P>
<P>
The projects constitute part of the country's main measures
designed to produce more food for its population of 1.2 billion,
and still growing.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Science and Technology Commission
(SSTC), the research projects will enable the project areas, or
five major grain-producing Henan, Hunan, Heilongjiang and Jilin
provinces and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, to increase their
annual grain output by 10 billion kilograms by the year 2000 over
current output.
</P>
<P>
The five provincial regions are also expected to increase their
annual cotton output by a total of 620,000 tons and soybeans by
1.6 billion kg.
</P>
<P>
The 23 institutes were chosen by experts from among 77 research
institutes who bid for the programs.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural research institutes under the central government
account for 60 percent of bid winners, including the institutes
under the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, China
Agricultural University, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the

The research projects, listed by SSTC as some of the country's
major research projects during the remaining years of this
century, focus on improved varieties of rice, wheat, corn, soybean
and cotton, better pest and insect control, fertilizer application
and growing technology.
</P>
<P>
SSTC, together with the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry
of Water Conservancy, CAS and other departments, signed agreements
last year with the five provinces and region on joint research and
development of the farming techniques.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreements, the five areas are obliged to set
up 667 hectares of rice and cotton demonstration farmland with the
the per-unit yield reaching, by the 21st century, the highest
levels of other parts of the world that have similar biological
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The areas are also have to set up nearly 6,700 ha of
experimental farmland, 67,000 ha of demonstration farmland and
apply advanced farming technology to nearly 667,000 ha of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Techniques concerning rice, corn and soybean each number four

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Import Rice for Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will import rice for food
and not for industrial purposes during the second half of this
year for the first time in 13 years, the Finance and Economy
Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the Minimum Market Access (MMA) stipulations of the
Uruguay- round multilateral trade agreement reached in 1993, South
Korea imported 50,400 tons of rice for industrial use last year
and will import 66,360 tons for food use this year, according to
the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The exclusive import of food rice will be the first ever since
the 1981-1983 period, when 2.73 million tons of such rice was
imported due to a poor harvest in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government is considering importing rice for
food from Australia, China or the United States as the rice
produced in these countries is on par with the one produced
domestically, a ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
A tentative agreement has been reached with related government
agencies on the need to import food rice in preparation for a poor
crop this autumn or additional rice aid to the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK), the official said, adding that Seoul
will make a final decision on the matter next month.
</P>
<P>
If the government decides to import food rice next month, it
will be immediately open to international bidding, the official
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 20 (Xinhua)--Tuberculosis is becoming an
increasingly serious problem in Vietnam, causing 25,000 people to
die a year, said an official report today.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Viet Co, Head of the National Tuberculosis Prevention
Committee said that 130,000 people are infected every year. 45
percent of them are diagnosed and treated, while the rest live in
their communities without treatment.
</P>
<P>
TB infection rate in Vietnam is currently higher than that of
other Asia-Pacific countries, said the report.
</P>
<P>
According to latest research from the Tay Nguyen highlands,
central, and northern mountainous areas, the infection rate is as
high as 6.5 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
Between 0.02 and 0.06 percent of children are infected with
tuberculosis every year, said the report, adding that up to 38
percent of the children being treated at the tuberculosis and lung
disease hospitals have a particular strain of the disease, the one
which leads to tuberculous meningitis.
</P>
<P>
A much more serious problem is the fact that hiv/aids sufferers
are very susceptible to tuberculosis, said the report. According
to a local tuberculosis and lung disease hospital, 20 out of 40
hiv carriers are suffering from tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has set a target to reduce tuberculosis cases by a full
70 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the anti-tuberculosis programme meets
with a shortage of staff and equipment.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Party Secures Majority of Parliament Seats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's ruling New Korea Party
(NKP) has secured a majority in the National Assembly after
independent lawmaker-elect Lim Jin-chul joined the party here
today.
</P>
<P>
Lim, elected from North Kyongsang Province, has given the NKP
its 150th out of the 299 seats in the new parliament which opens
early next month.
</P>
<P>
In the 15th South Korean National Assembly elections held on
April 11, the NKP headed by President Kim Young-sam won 139 seats,
11 short of a simple majority in the 299-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition National Congress for New Politics (NCNP)
led by Kim Dae-jung secured 79 seats, the conservative opposition
United Liberal Democrats (ULD) headed by Kim Jong-pil got 50 seats
and the minor Democratic Party (DP) obtained 15 seats. The
remaining 16 seats went to independents.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the three opposition parties have decided to launch
a combined political offensive to protest the ruling NKP's move to
recruit independent and opposition lawmakers-elect to gain a
majority in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The offensive will include a public display of information on
election campaign irregularities allegedly committed by the ruling
NKP and political rallies denouncing those lawmakers-elect who
have joined the NKP.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties said that they will boycott the new
parliament if the government fails to meet their demand for a
thorough investigation of all alleged election frauds.

BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The automobile industry in
southwest China's Guizhou Province is expected to generate 12
billion yuan in output value by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Car manufacturers will by then be able to produce 150,000

<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's 6,700-plus
non-governmental scientific and technological enterprises led all
local enterprises in per-capita productivity last year, surpassing
134,600 yuan. This was nearly 38 percent up over 1994, today's
Shanghai-based "Wenhui Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The rise was attributed to fact that they poured large amounts
of investment in scientific and technological research and
development, which accounted for nearly 10 percent of their sales.
</P>
<P>
The city now has a total of 6,787 such enterprises, with 21 of
them each having more than 100 million yuan of assets, and 20 each
earning more than 100 million yuan-worth of income in
technological, industrial and trade sectors in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Last year they reported total sales adding up to nearly 17.7
billion yuan, up nearly 40 percent over 1994. Together they also
injected 1.67 billion yuan in research and development, nearly
doubling the 1994 figure.

<HEADLINE> Kid Brother And Sister Program For Orphans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- College students are helping
offsprings in one-child families and orphans with China's first
"adopt a kid" scheme.
</P>
<P>
So far more than 100 offsprings in one-child families and
orphans in Shenyang, capital city of northeast China's Liaoning
province, have been "adopted". Their new older 'brothers and
sisters' not only become part-time teachers, but good friends as
well.
</P>
<P>
Around 1,000 students from 25 local colleges and universities
have signed contracts with social welfare organizations and
orphanages to act as surrogate "brothers and sisters" for
children. The idea is that they will help them resolve any
difficulties in living and studying.
</P>
<P>
The program, launched by the Shenyang City Committee of Chinese
Communist Youth League, is the first of its kind in the country
this year.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jiamian, deputy researcher of the Liaoning Education
Research Institute, said that student brothers and sisters would
effectively improve the sense of cooperation among only children
when they grow up, and weaken their sense of individualism.
</P>
<P>
"This will also supplement weak communication between parents
and children," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, through their own experiences, the college students
will teach the children how to establish a correct outlook on
life, morale and ambition, to make a successful career.

<HEADLINE> Dalian Bonded Zone Regarded as "Tax Free Haven" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Dalian's Bonded Zone, still under
construction, promises to be a mini tax haven for investors.
</P>
<P>
The zone will be offering a series of preferential policies,
including exemption of tariffs for commodities entering and
leaving China via the zone.
</P>
<P>
Goods will also be free from import valued-added tax, consumer
tax, and import and export licenses, according to Jiang Lihua, the
Director of the zone.
</P>
<P>
The bonded zone is located in the Dalian Economic Development
Zone, and so far the construction of 1.6 square kilometers of a
projected eight square kilometer area has been completed.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 projects have already been attracted to the
bonded zone, including about 500 schemes funded by Japan, the
United States, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Hongkong and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Preferential policies are to be offered to manufacturing
enterprises established in the zone, including exemption from
imported raw and semi-finished materials, and parts from tariffs
and the value-added tax. If goods using imported materials are
sold in China, then tariffs and taxes will be levied only on
imported materials.
</P>
<P>
Trade companies in the zone will be allowed to establish
commodity trading markets in the zone, and with authority, will be
allowed to display bonded products outside the zone.
</P>
<P>
Companies building storage facilities in the zone will also,
with permission, be authorised to store goods produced outside the
zone, and can serve as agent for transportation companies and for
commodity distribution.

<HEADLINE> China's Rising Demand for Buses, Bicycles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- China's demand for buses and
bicycles are on the increase, as the country of 1.2 billion people
continues to depend on public transport or peddle power as a way
of getting around.
</P>
<P>
Officials predict that demand for buses this year will reach
360,000, up some 12.5 percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
Orders for light-duty buses are expected to reach more than
200,000, while over 127,000 mini-buses are expected to be
needed. There is likely to be a need for almost 28,000 larger and
medium-sized buses.
</P>
<P>
But peddle-power still dominates the streets with China now
having more than 10 bicycle manufacturers each with an annual
output topping one million bicycles. Some medium and small-sized
bicycle makers are reported to be unprofitable, and only 30
percent of producers with the Cycling Association of China make
profits.
</P>
<P>
The increase in demand is largely due to people replacing their
two-wheelers every ten years, compared to the previous lifespan of
a cycle of 15 years.

<HEADLINE> Coastal Province Develops Marine Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The coastal province of Zhejiang
in east China is building a marine economy consisting of ocean
shipping, fishery, industry, trade and tourism.
</P>
<P>
The province has a sea area of 424,000 sq km, and a
6,500-km-long coast line, the longest of any Chinese
provinces. Zhejiang also has over 3,000 sea islands each with over
500 sq m, accounting for one third of China's total.
</P>
<P>
With 166 km of its coast line suitable for the construction of
deep water berths, Zhejiang has built 58 sea ports with 671
berths, with over 30 deep water berths.
</P>
<P>
Ningbo Port, the biggest in the province, is heading for its
goal of becoming an international cargo container trans-shipping
center in a supporting role for an international shipping center
to be established in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
More than ten cargo container regular shipping routes have been
opened between Zhejiang and eastern coastal ports in America, Kobe
and Nagasaki in Japan, and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Backed by well-developed port facilities, a power generation
base for east China is taking shape in Zhejiang's coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, large and super large power stations have been
built in the area such as those in Zhenhai, Beilun port, Jiaxing
and Wenzhou, which help ease power shortage in east China, one of
the most developed part in the country.
</P>
<P>
Qinshan Nuclear Power Station near Jiaxing, China's first to be
designed and constructed by its own engineers and workers, started
operation in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang has found large reserves of petroleum and natural gas
in the continental shelf along its coast. So far three oil and gas
fields and four structures have been found, and commercial
exploitation of the first Sino-foreign jointly drilled oil well
will soon start.
</P>
<P>
Having China's biggest fishery in Zhoushan, Zhejiang has seen
the establishment of more than 100 biochemical, food and medicine
plants focusing on processing of marine products.
</P>
<P>
The province is also developing marine tourism, featuring its
beautiful islands.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Accelerates Port Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Deep-water Beilun Port, near Ningbo
in China's Zhejiang Province, is expected to inject 60 million US
dollars in the technical transformation of its container terminal.
</P>
<P>
The scheme is seen as support for Shanghai, the major port on
the east China Sea, aiming to become an international shipping
center, according to Zhejiang provincial authorities.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year during inspection tours to Shanghai, Jiangsu
and Zhejiang, Premier Li Peng and Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo called
for measures to build Shanghai into an international shipping
center to be speeded up. They also called for support from
neighboring Jiangsu and Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
The Beilun Port transformation scheme aims at bringing the
handling capacity of the terminal to 800,000 standard
containers. The project is the result of one of four special
meetings of the Zhejiang provincial authorities.
</P>
<P>
Beilun Port authorities have already ordered part of the
equipment needed for the transformation from Japan and Germany.
</P>
<P>
The port is also injecting huge funds in modern facilities and
sending people to Hong Kong on study tours, designed to upgrade
port management, which will eventually ensure the port operates
around the clock -- 365 days a year and 24 hours a day, port
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Also under the plan, the port will launch regular liners to the
eastern seaboard of the United States. Plans for liners to be sent
to Canada and Europe are also being studies.
</P>
<P>
Steps are also being taken to improve railway, highway and sea
transportation to facilitate shipping activities.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Coffee Exports Drop by 10 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's coffee exports dropped by
10 percent last month at the end of the main season in central
and eastern coffee-growing regions, according to an official
report here today.
</P>
<P>
The report issued by the Uganda Coffee Development Authority
said foreign exchange earnings from coffee dropped by the same
percentage.
</P>
<P>
It said 439,012 bags worth 40.7 million US Dollars were
exported in March compared to 394.980 bags worth 36.7 million US
Dollars exported in April.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the drop to the low price. The unit
value of the first seven months of 1995/96 coffee season was 1.63
Dollars per kilogram compared to 2.74 Dollars per kilogram for
the same period last season.
</P>
<P>
It said price rises may be short-lived as Brazilian and
Indonesian new coffee crop enters the market. Largest rises in
production are expected to be in India and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Brazil's projected output for 1996/97
is estimated at 25.3 million bags.

<HEADLINE> Higher Education Reform Focuses on Textbooks, Curriculum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- China will reform the teaching
contents and curriculum arrangement of its higher education this
year and for the rest of the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000)
period.
</P>
<P>
Deans of universities and colleges across the country who met
recently in this capital city of east China's Jiangxi Province,
agreed that reform should be focussed on curricula which are out
of step with the growth of the market economy, and the development
of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 professors and scholars have applied for
participating in the research work for this reform, which was
launched by the State Education Commission (SEC) last year.
</P>
<P>
The textbooks used by today's Chinese college students were
compiled in 1950s and 1960s, and do not include the most
significant developments in science and technology in the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
The SEC has organized a group of experts to coordinate the
reform cautiously. It has also allocated a large sum of money for
it.
</P>
<P>
Several thousand education experts are compiling 300 to 500
series of new textbooks for 2.8 million college students, under
SEC guidance. That means 80 percent to 90 percent of all textbooks
for basic subjects will be rendered obsolete by the end of this
century.
</P>
<P>
The SEC has also decided to select 10 to 20 colleges and
universities this year to teach English as a foreign language in a
way different from the present rather test-oriented way. These
colleges and universities will be able to decide what to teach and
how to examine subjects by themselves.
</P>
<P>
College students in China are required to learn one foreign
language, usually English, if they are not attending a foreign
languages department. But many of them study English with the
motivation of finding better jobs.
</P>
<P>
Deans of some universities suggest that science be combined
with engineering, and literature with science. In China, if a
college student majors in literature, he or she does not need to
learn mathematics. And students from mathematics departments do
not have to learn physics.
</P>
<P>
The SEC will evaluate teaching in 108 colleges and universities
in 1996 and 1997. It also plans to finish the evaluation work
related to colleges and universities established in and after the
1970s by the year 1999.

<P>
JERUSALEM, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Israel's first envoy to Oman is
leaving this morning for Muscat, capital of Oman, to open an
interest office, the first in the Gulf Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry official Oded Ben-Hayin told Israel Radio
prior to his departure that he views his mission as a first step
in the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two
countries. "I hope that in the near future we are going to have
an embassy there," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the priority of his mission, the envoy said that economy
today goes with any political relations and Israel sees great
potentials to expand trade with the Gulf states and Oman in
particular.
</P>
<P>
Oman has been engaged in official contacts with Israel for
years. Late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin visited Oman and
earlier this year Prime Minister Shimon Peres became the second
Israeli leader to visit the country.
</P>
<P>
Following the opening of the Israeli interest office in Oman, a
similar office is expected to be set up soon in Qatar. Peres also
visited Qatar during his Gulf trip in April.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai People Drink More Beer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai women are hitting the
bottle as beer becomes a favorite tipple among the female classes
of China's biggest city.
</P>
<P>
Twenty percent of the city's beer stocks this year - around 95
million liters - are expected to be downed by women, compared to
just five percent last year.
</P>
<P>
A new survey shows that a total of 415,000 tons of beer -
equivalent to a thirst quenching 425 million liters - are likely
to be sold in Shanghai this year, a rise of 150,00 tons over
1995.
</P>
<P>
Of the total consumed 330,000 tons of beer will be brewed
locally and the rest will be brought in from other parts of
China.
</P>
<P>
Of the beer consumed by the people of Shanghai 72 percent will
be bottled, 23 percent casked, and five percent canned beers, the
survey carried out by the official organ of China's Ministry of
Internal Trade said.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicates that a growing number of women in Shanghai
have started turning to beer, with this year's figure expected to
reach 20 percent of drinkers, compared with five percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that over 95 percent of the beer marketed
in Shanghai are produced by Sino-foreign joint ventures, such as
Germany's Beckers and Japanese brand Sundory.
</P>
<P>
Another conclusion is that draught beers enjoyed by foreign
drinkers, are becoming more popular in China.
</P>
<P>
A mobile population, estimated at three million, is another
factor leading to the increase in beer consumption, the survey
shows.

<HEADLINE> Tourists Can Visit Twelfth Century In Re-Built City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Tourists can take a trip back in
time to China's Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279) following the
opening of a new attraction in the famed resort city of Hangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The old city, in east China's Zhejiang province, has been
"re-constructed" in a special theme park that reproduces the life
of the dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Song City, seven km from West Lake at the southeast of
Hangzhou proper, is located in a national tourist zone.
</P>
<P>
Hangzhou was the capital city of Southern Song Dynasty, and
Song City displays folk customs, arts of the period, and
Song-style gardens and buildings.
</P>
<P>
The main part of Song City is a replica of the renowned
painting Riverside Scenes on Qingming Festival.
</P>
<P>
There are nine stone pillars at the entrance of the City. With
a diameter of one meter and a height of ten meters, each pillar is
carved with a dragon, symbol of authority and sublimity in Chinese
culture.
</P>
<P>
Occupying an area of 20 hectares, and with a building area of
13,000 sq m, Song City cost over 200 million yuan to build. A
manager of the City said the second phase construction, including
a reproduction of the imperial palace of the dynasty, is already
underway.

<HEADLINE> Foreign-Funded Enterprises Asked to Sign Collective Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 14,000 foreign-invested
enterprises will have to sign collective contracts with their
employees this year, today's People's Daily (overseas edition)
reported.
</P>
<P>
That would make up 30 percent of all foreign-funded enterprises
with trade union agreements across the country.
</P>
<P>
China now has 46,000 foreign enterprises - over half of the
total - who have trade unions agreements with employees.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 2,300 foreign enterprises formed trade unions.
</P>
<P>
Yang Fuxing, vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade
Unions (ACFTU), the top authority body of trade unions in China,
called for the speeding up of negotiation systems in foreign
enterprises and the signing of collective contracts.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions, on behalf of employees, sign labor contracts with
employers of foreign enterprises so that legal rights and
interests of employees can be protected by law.
</P>
<P>
Both parties of labor contracts should focus on the quality of
the contracts, not the form only and issues related to labor
relations between employees and employers should be coordinated in
the form of collective contracts signed by both parties after
serious and comprehensive negotiations, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Yang also asked trade unions to consult workers when drafting
the contracts. The draft should be submitted to, and adopted by,
the workers' representative congress or all workers.

<HEADLINE> More Use of Telephones Among Fishermen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Nearly a third of fishermen in some
of Jiangsu province's fishing towns have installed telephones to
help them land prize catches at sea.
</P>
<P>
They use their phones to get market information and information
on fisheries, as well as acting as a link with their land-bound
families.
</P>
<P>
According to an investigation in Xinyang and Huangsha, two
fishing towns in the province, more than 1,900 families, or nearly
a third of the total, have installed program-controlled telephones.
</P>
<P>
Fishermen use telephones to keep in close contact with their
families when they are at sea. The phones also help their
business, by allowing them to get up to date market and fishing
information.
</P>
<P>
Fisherfolk today have to conduct businesses, so they need to be
connected to their markets.
</P>
<P>
The local post and telecommunications office has spent over
three million yuan on new equipment to expand the number of
program-controlled telephones to three times its previous capacity
- increasing the telephone numbers from original 500 to present
2,000.
</P>
<P>
With the growth of the local economy, it is no longer a mere
luxury for fishermen to spend several thousand yuan to install a
telephone. Now a phone is as essential as a fishing net to help
develop the local fishing economy.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand's Prenatal HIV Transmission Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Prenatal transmission of HIV/AIDS
from mother to infant poses an important social problem as the
number of children infected with the virus is increasing rapidly
in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Last year some 6,000 infants were infected with HIV from their
mothers, according to Dr Viput Phoolcharoen, director of the AIDS
Control Division of the Public Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, one in every four infants born to HIV-infected
women carry the virus: while in Chiang Rai, the rate is as high as
42 percent.
</P>
<P>
If the situation continues at this rate, by the year 2000 the
number of HIV-positive infants would rise to 7,000 per year, Viput
said.
</P>
<P>
Even if infants do not contract the virus from their parents,
they are bound to end up as orphans since their parents are likely
to die before they are able to take care of themselves, Viput
said.
</P>
<P>
The number of orphans born to HIV-infected parents would rise
to an alarming annual rate of 20,000 by the year 2000. This number
includes babies contracting HIV from their mothers.
</P>
<P>
Doctors say HIV transmission can be controlled if the
HIV-positive mother is advised to feed their babies with powdered
milk rather than breast-feed them.
</P>
<P>
However, sometimes it is difficult for the doctors to
discourage breast-feeding by HIV-infected mothers because if they
are told that they are HIV-positive, some of them would commit
suicide, the doctors say.
</P>
<P>
Thai society still cannot accept HIV/AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
Faced with the HIV/AIDS problem, the government is spending
more and more money in a bid to control its spread. Its budget for
HIV/AIDS control and awareness campaigns has increased from 182
million baht (7.28 million U.S. dollars) in 1991 to 2.06 billion
baht (82.28 million dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In addition, The government has also stepped up research on
remedies from tropical plants.

<P>
HARARE, May  (Xinhua) -- In recent years, Zimbabwe's tourism
sector has been experiencing a striking progress, creating a new
record by earning the country 222 million US Dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Among Zimbabwe's economic sectors, the tourism industry has
been growing at the highest speed in the past five years, with
the number of foreign visitors to Zimbabwe jumping to 1.2 million
in 1995 from 500,000 in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The southern African country's tourism earnings have also
increased significantly. In 1995, the tourism receipts from
foreign visitors reached 127 million US Dollars, nearly tripling
the 1990 figure of 47.6 million US Dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, tourism revenue only accounted for 3.4 percent of
Zimbabwe's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), while the percentage
nearly doubled to 6.6 percent in l995. The percentage of tourism
earnings in the country's total export value leaped to 9.93
percent in 1995 from 5.56 percent in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
This year, Zimbabwe's tourism is expected to continue to grow,
by 20 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
What has stimulated the rapid development of Zimbabwe's
tourism sector in recent years?
</P>
<P>
With the end of the Cold War, southern Africa has been
marching forward along the path of peace amd stability. The birth
of new South Africa, the end of civil war in Mozambique and the
on-going peace process in Angola have provided good opportunities
for the development of Zimbabwe's tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
The political stability in Zimbabwe has also created favorable
climates for the rapid development of the country's tourism.
</P>
<P>
Peace has brought about stability, stability has brought about
economic progress, and economic progress has improved living
standards of the people. All these have contributed to the
flourishing tourism trade in the country.

</P>
<P>
After enjoying a sightseeing tour to Victoria Falls with his
family in February this year, President of the International
Olympic Committee Juan Antonio Samaranch said it is a top-class
tourist spot in the world.
</P>
<P>
Now there is a direct flight from South Africa's Johannesburg
and two direct flights from Harare to Victoria Falls every day.
But air tickets must be booked in advance because of excessive
demands.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe Ruins, located in the southwest of the country, is
the largest and most intact stone-built structure group in
sub-Sahara region of the continent. It is also a main tourism
attraction in Zimbabwe for its surprising scale and artistic
level.
</P>

provide quality food and accommodation to visitors. In tourist
spots, on sale are varieties of handicraft articles with local
flavors, such as wood carving, stone carving and copperplates.

to earn one billion US Dollars annually from the tourism industry
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, the Zimbabwean government is drawing up
an implementation program to increase tourism income and upgrade
tourist facilities. It has decided to build a more modern
international airport in Harare to adapt to the development of
the country's tourism industry.

<HEADLINE> Tourism to be Top Revenue Source in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
projected that the tourism sector will become the country's top
foreign exchange source contributing more than 15 billion US
dollars to the economy in 2005, The Indonesian Observer reported
today.
</P>
<P>
"Tourism will overtake oil as the principal source of revenue
for Indonesia within the next decade," Director General of Tourism
Andi Mappi Sammeng told local press on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the tourism sector ranked fourth as the country's
foreign exchange source contributing 4.57 billion US dollars, an
increase of 88.5 percent from that in 1985. Indonesia's main
sources of foreign exchange are oil and gas, timber and textile.

<P>
Indonesia is the world's largest archipelago with more than
17,000 islands stretching along the equator for 5,120 kilometers
or approximately twice the distance from London to Moscow. Last
year, more than four million tourists came to the country.
</P>
<P>
The Tourism Promotion Board (ITPB) of Indonesia have poured
billions of dollars into tourism industry for developing
infrastructure such as hotels, recreation parks and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
From 1988 to 1995 alone, ITPB invested 7.2 billion US dollars
in tourism industry with a total of 1,337 projects.
</P>
<P>
Sammeng said that a new master plan is being undertaken to
reflect the concerns and priorities in the 1990s and beyond.

<HEADLINE> Awareness Against Women Trafficking Urged in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A main opposition party leader
urged all concerned governmental and non-governmental agencies in
Nepal to generate awareness against woman trafficking to control
the rampant inhuman activities in some remote, backward areas of
the country.
</P>
<P>
President of the Communist Party of Nepal (UML) Man Mohan
Adhikari, while inaugurating a video film based on real-life
stories of Nepali girls who were sold abroad for prostitution
Sunday, also called for the authorities to severely punish those
involved in girl trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The film, produced by a local NGO called Women Rehabilitation
Center, depicts the tragic lives of Nepali prostitutes in foreign
countries, mostly in big Indian cities.
</P>
<P>
Adhikari said the government should bring back the Nepali girls
who had been rescued from foreign brothels and rehabilitate them.
</P>
<P>
Referring to over 200 Nepali girls recently rescued from
brothels in Bombay by Indian police, he accused the government of
doing nothing to help them and promised to ask Prime Minister Sher
Bahaur Deuba to take up this matter.
</P>
<P>
Social workers here estimated that about 25,000 to 30,000
Nepali women were sold into prostitution trade in foreign
countries every year.

<HEADLINE> Writ Petition Against Ex-Bangladeshi President's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A writ petition challenging former
Bangladeshi president H. M. Ershad's candidature in the ensuing
general election has been rejected by the Dhaka High Court.
</P>
<P>
A. K. M. Mayeedul Islam, former minister of Ershad's cabinet in
1980s and now Ershad's rival candidate nominated by the former
Ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), filed the writ petition
arguing that Ershad, now serving prison terms under criminal
charges on moral turpitude, should be barred from contesting the
election fixed on June 12.
</P>
<P>
But a division bench of the High Court ruled out the writ
petition, upholding the earlier decisions of the High Court and
the appellate division of the Supreme Court that Ershad is
competent to contest the ensuing polls as his appeals against the
judgments and orders of conviction and sentence are pending and
his trial is yet to be concluded.
</P>
<P>
Ershad, who is also chairman of one of the country's major
parties, the Jatiya (national) Party, took over power in 1980 and
was forced to step down in 1989. Not long after, he was put into
jail under the BNP government for alleged corruption cases.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in ethnic conflict
in Assam, India, has rose to 50 as the government of the state
moved to contain the violence, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Sporadic ethnic violence in the past three months took a turn
for the worse on Saturday when miscreants set ablaze 65 villages
in the Kokrajhar district of the east Indian state.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 200,000 people have been rendered homeless following the
torching of the villages and most of them were now sheltered in 20
relief camps opened by the district administration.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the toll was likely to increase as the police
and paramilitary forces were continuing their search for the
bodies of victims.
</P>
<P>
Assam Chief Minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta Sunday announced
the formation of a commission of inquiry to probe the ethnic
violence in the state.

<HEADLINE> Scholarship Fund for College Students Established </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- China's largest scholarship fund
for college students was created here on Saturday, today's China
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
A Beijing-based company donated 10 million yuan (about 1.2
million U.S. dollars) to the Chinese Communist Youth League
Central Committee and the All-China Students' Federation, who set
up a scholarship with the money for college students across the
country.
</P>
<P>
Each year 100 top college students would receive the
award. Some of them may get as much as 10,000 yuan (about 1,200
U.S. dollars) for outstanding academic achievements, important
inventions and voluntary service.
</P>
<P>
The scholarship, named for the donor Jianhao Co., is part of an
awarding system the league intends to build up in the next two or
three years.
</P>
<P>
Starting next month, a national expert team formed by young
scholars and education officials would start operation to
determine the winners of the scholarship.
</P>
<P>
Candidates are required to distinguish themselves in school
and in provincial and national-level selections to earn the award,
presented at the end of each year.
</P>
<P>
Last October, the league established a 1.2-million-yuan
scholarship to help poor students go through college education.

<HEADLINE> China's Two-Way Trade to Double with Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Trade between China and Iran will
top one billion US dollars this year, doubling last year's figure,
according to an Iranian diplomat, at a briefing for Iran's first
ever commodity show, to be held here.
</P>
<P>
Massoud Maleki, first secretary and head of the economic
section of the Iranian Embassy in Beijing, said two-way trade hit
504 million dollars last year, and the figure can be easily
doubled this year, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
"But by saying this, we are not setting a ceiling," he added.
</P>
<P>
China and Iran both agreed to host trade fairs in the other's
country last year, and Iran is prepared to play host to a Chinese
trade fair that the Chinese side is to decide the time, the
diplomat side.
</P>
<P>
He noted that bilateral trade has much room to expand, and last
year's two-way trade figure just accounted for two percent of
Iran's total external trade.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation is also gathering speed, he said, and
China recently beat major rival including France, Russia, and
Japan, to win a 580-million-dollar equipment contract from the
Teheran metro project, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A fleet of domestically-made light
vehicles rolled off Tian'anmen Square Saturday, and started their
8,000-km "Long March" across China, highlighting the country's
determination to develop the motor industry into an economic
pillar.
</P>
<P>
China Daily reported that the 45-day rally is also considered
as a move to commemorate the Long March that the Chinese Red Army
launched 62 years ago. And the 13 vehicles made in Beijing will
rise to the challenge on all kind of roads, along a set route
through 22 major cities and historic towns in 12 provinces.
</P>
<P>
The fleet will also launch a series of campaigns along the
route to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the industry, which
started in 1956 when the first Jiefang (Liberation) brand truck
rolled off the production line at the China First Automobile
Works(FAW).
</P>
<P>
Zhong Hongqing, vice-president of Beijing Light Automobile Co.,
Ltd (BLAC), a major manufacturer with an annual capacity of 8,000

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Vows to Use More Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 20 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province,
an economic powerhouse, has vowed to attract more than 48.5
billion US dollars in overseas investments in the coming five
years.
</P>
<P>
More overseas investment is vital to the launching of a number
of large infrastructure projects in water conservancy, energy,
transportation and telecommunications, said local foreign trade
and economic cooperation officials.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong, geographically close to Hong Kong and Macao,
utilized overseas investment totalling 40.6 billion US dollars
between 1991 and 1995. Overseas investment has been a driving
force in the development of its export-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
In the 1996-2000 period, the province will issue favorable
policies to guide overseas investment mainly into infrastructure,
basic industries, comprehensive agricultural development, hi-tech
industries and pillar industries.
</P>
<P>
Finance, insurance, commerce, tourism and property will
continue to absorb overseas investment to a moderate degree,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Judging from current trends, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan
business people and overseas Chinese will continue to be the major
investors in Guangdong, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The province will strive to attract foreign investment from
European countries, the United States and Japan, and expand
cooperation between provincial firms and multinationals worldwide,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
It will explore diversified means, like BOT (Build, Operate,
Transfer) schemes, to attract overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
The booming Zhujiang River Delta and special economic zones are
being urged to attract more overseas investments by using their
existing advantages.
</P>
<P>
Officials expect use of overseas investment to be expanded to
the east and the west of the delta and the mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the province will work out preferential policies
to encourage large enterprises or groups to invest abroad.

<HEADLINE> New Technology To Put Trash To Better Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- New environment friendly technology
has been developed to turn urban domestic garbage to good use,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The technology, approved by the Beijing Municipal Science and
Technology Committee, can turn 95 percent of domestic garbage into
organic compound fertilizer and bricks, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
It explains how the technology works: first domestic garbage
sent to the treatment center is separated from plastic
waste. Then, the garbage is mixed with some organic materials and
a small amount of chemical fertilizer to produce a compound
fertilizer. The ashes of solid waste which cannot be turned into
fertilizer are used to make bricks.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Shijingshan Garbage Treatment Demonstration Center
recently started to use the technology.
</P>
<P>
The center is listed by the Beijing municipal government as one
of the city's ten major environmental protection projects to be
completed this year.
</P>
<P>
The technology is developed by Taishan Green Products
Manufacturing Co Ltd, which is also the investor behind the
garbage treatment center, the paper reports.
</P>
<P>
After a first-phase investment of 13 million yuan, the center
can now treat 250 tons of domestic garbage a day and is able to
turn out five tons of organic compound fertilizer an hour.
</P>
<P>
Total investment in the center will reach 30 million yuan in
the near future, the paper quotes Lin Rongqiang, chairman of the
Taishan company, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The investment should be recovered in six years because
development of organic compound fertilizer is encouraged by the
state and demand for such fertilizer is growing.

<HEADLINE> WHO: Infectious Diseases Biggest Health Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 20 (xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
Monday warned that infectious diseases, killing over 17 million
people annually, remain the biggest threat to public health
globally.
</P>
<P>
Infectious diseases accounted for 17.6 million of the 51.9
million deaths in 1995, the world's leading killer, the agency
said in its annual report.
</P>
<P>
The victims included 4.4 million of acute respiratory
infections, 3.1 million of diarrhoea and tuberculosis each and 2.1
million of malaria. Hepatitis B, HIV/AIDS and measles each claimed
over 1 million.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that control of infectious diseases has become
increasingly difficult, as some seemingly subdued have come back,
others gained drug resistance, while incurable new types emerged.
</P>
<P>
In the last 20 years at least 30 new diseases emerged, for many
of them there is no treatment, cure or vaccine. AIDS, unknown
until 15 years ago, is expected to infect a cumulative total of 40
million by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Among the new types were also the Ebola hemorrhagic fever,
which appeared in 1976 and caused a 77 percent mortality rate in
an epidemic in Zaire in mid-1995, and hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome, first found in 1993 in the United States. In animals,
the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) was known in 1986 in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
The emerging new diseases also include those spreading to new
geographical areas, such as cholera in South America and yellow
fever in Kenya, as well as those seeing large increase in
incidence, such as diphtheria in former Soviet Union republics and
TB, coming back after being well under control for many years.
</P>
<P>
The report added migration and mass movement of refugees and
displaced persons, growing international air travel, trade and
tourism and climate changes are helping spread diseases more
rapidly and widely.
</P>
<P>
On top of them, continuing population growth, by some 90
million yearly in the next 20 years, and rapid urbanization that
will force 60 percent of the 9.8 billion global population by 2050
to live in overcrowded and unhygienic conditions, pose also serious
threats.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Crystals made by Baccarat France,
formerly exclusive treasures for Western world before, are now
also favourite buys of Chinese customers.
</P>
<P>
Today's "China Daily" quoted Teoh Wei Kium, general manager of
the Baccarat France's China operation as saying, Baccarat's
gold-inlaid wine decanters with delicate patterns, crystal rings
and pendants enjoy a wide market in China.
</P>
<P>
The products are mainly bought by Chinese individuals, staffs
of state-owned companies and foreign-funded enterprises, added she.
</P>
<P>
In the company's newly-opened boutique in Beijing, the price of
a single piece of crystal ranges from 48 US dollars to 14,500 US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Baccarat's only four-month-long trial operation in China
indicates that the country has a strong purchasing power for the
crystals, which will encourage the company to make its foray into
the China's market.

<HEADLINE> Less Dust, Sand in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Only a decade ago, spring meant
being afflicted by dust and sand for residents of the Chinese
capital. But now, Beijingers are enjoying more sunny days and
fresh air.
</P>
<P>
According to the Beijing Bureau of Forestry, there have been
18.2 windy days and 12.3 sandstorm days annually in the 1990s,
half of the number of such days 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"The amount of dust dropped from a monthly 31.4 tons
per sq km in the 1980s to 18.5 tons a month in 1993," a
forestry official said.
</P>
<P>
The tree coverage of Beijing hopefully will reach 40
percent by the year 2010, according local officials.
</P>
<P>
Over the last decade Beijing residents have planted trees in
and around the city, with wood coverage reaching 36.26 percent.

<P>
GUIYANG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guizhou Province
is capturing its rich ethnic heritage and culture on film.
</P>
<P>
The province is one of China's regions inhabited with a number
of ethnic minority groups.
</P>
<P>
There are 16 ethnic groups that have lived in Guizhou for
generations. Scholars and experts digged deep into the evolution,
history, languages, customs, culture and art, and current living
situation of the national minorities. They wrote film scripts
based on their research.
</P>
<P>
Emei Film Studio in Sichuan Province has finished shooting
films about five ethnic groups, including Miao, Dong, Bouyei and
Gelao, and with films about another three ethnic groups almost
completed.
</P>

<HEADLINE> WHO: Mortality Rate in Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
said Monday that about 52 million people died in 1995, the same as
was 35 years ago, but suggested a mortality rate of 9.1 deaths per
thousand population, down from 16.5 in 1960.
</P>
<P>
Sharp decline in death rate was registered in the developing
countries, from 20 deaths per thousand people in 1960 to about 9
last year, particularly due to the mortality reduction in the
youngest age groups.
</P>
<P>
The highest death rate was reported in Africa, where locate the
most of the world's Least Developed Countries (LDCs) that posted a
death rate of about 14.4 deaths per thousand people, lagging 25
years behind other developing nations in the decline of death
rates.
</P>
<P>
Europe came next, as a result of a very high proportion of
elderly in population, said WHO in its annual report of 1996
published on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Of the total deaths in 1995, over 11 million were among
children aged under 5, and over 22 million above age of 65 years,
it added.
</P>
<P>
Between 1980 and 1995, WHO said, highest decline in the number
of deaths -- 2.5 million occurred among children under 5.
Meanwhile, deaths increased by 1.6 million for the adult
population aged between 20 and 64.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the global average of mortality for children under 5
was reported at 81.7 per 1,000 live births, down from 134 in 1970,
or a 40 percent decline during the period.
</P>
<P>
In the developing world, it was 90.6 per thousand, compared to
8.5 in the developed economies.
</P>
<P>
Decline in infant mortality from 1970 to 1995 was 66 percent in
the developed nations, 30 percent in the LDCs, with a global
average at more than 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 60 of every 1,000 live new-born babies died in the
first year of life globally, compared to 97 in 1970.
</P>
<P>
The worst infant mortality rate was in Sierra leone, 160 deaths
per thousand live births. It was followed by Afghanistan, 159
deaths per thousand live births; Mali, 154; Mozambique, 143 and
Malawi, 139.
</P>
<P>
WHO said infectious diseases caused about 17 million deaths, or
one third of the total last year, most of them occurring in Africa
and South-East Asia.
</P>
<P>
They included about 9 million deaths among children under 5 and
about 2.5 million among adults age between 15 and 59 years.
</P>
<P>
It is added that pregnancy-related diseases killed about
585,000 women in 1995 and every year, 99 percent of them in the
developing countries.

<HEADLINE> WHO: Ebola-like New Diseases Posing Urgent Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
today called on the international community to come up with
adequate political will and resources to combat an urgent threat
to human health -- newly emerging diseases.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1996 World Health Report published Monday by
the WHO, at least 30 new diseases have emerged during the past two
decades globally, threatening the health of hundreds of millions
of people. For many of them there is no treatment, cure or
vaccine, and therefore the possibility of preventing or
controlling them is limited.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the facts, there is still a lack of political will
and resources to develop and support the systems that are
necessary to detect new diseases and stop their spread, the WHO
said.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO account, new diseases emerged in the past 20
years include:
</P>
<P>
-- Ebola haemorrhagic fever, unknown 20 years ago, has since
struck in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the United States. The
most notable outbreak occurred in Zaire in 1995, killing 245
people, or about 80 percent of 316 cases. The natural host of the
Ebola virus remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
-- The AIDS virus, HIV, unknown barely a 15 years ago, has
already infected up to 24 million adults, of whom at least four
million have died. The cumulative total could reach 40 million in
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
-- A new variant of the incurable Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,
first reported in 1994 in Britain, has since infected ten people
there, including eight deaths. Scientific research is still
required to verify the possible link between the human brain
disease and the so-called "mad cow disease". Such a fear, however,
has already triggered public panic in Europe recently.
</P>
<P>
-- A completely new strain of cholera, called Vibrio cholerae
0139, appeared in southeastern India in 1992 and has since spread
to other areas of India as well as western China, Thailand and
other parts of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
-- Hantavirus infections, first recognized in the United States
in 1993, have been detected in more than 20 American states. They
can cause a pulmonary syndrome with a fatality rate of over 50
percent. Cases have also occurred in Canada and Argentina, Brazil
and Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
-- Recently-recognized organisms such as cryptosporidium or new
strains of bacteria such as Escherichia coli cause epidemics of
foodborne and waterborne diseases in both industrialed and
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the WHO, the reasons for outbreaks of new diseases
are complex and still not fully understood. The fact is however
that national health has become an international challenge. An
outbreak anywhere must now be seen as a threat to virtually all
countries, especially those that serve as major hubs of
international travel.
</P>
<P>
To combat newly emerging disease, the WHO called for combined
short-term and long-term action to be taken by international
health community.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, the WHO said, a speedy response is needed to
outbreaks of important new infections to prevent it from further
spread.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, intensive research should be conducted on the
natural history of new diseases and on possibilities for
preventing, treating, and controlling them. A global surveillance
programme is also essential.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government has
announced an increase of 15 million NZ dollars (10.2 million US
dollars) in Accommodation Supplement.
</P>
<P>
The announcement, made by the housing minister and the social
welfare minister at midnight Sunday, will benefit about 43,000
households from July 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The increase will ease pressure on those people living in
communities where rental accommodation is in high demand.
</P>
<P>
The Accommodation Supplement is the cash subsidy paid to low
income earners and beneficiaries to help them with their rent or
mortgage costs.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said they had approved the changes in the housing
subsidy to take account of recent cost rises in urban areas such
as Auckland, Wellington and provincial centers.

<HEADLINE> WHO: Diseases More Resistant to Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
Monday said that antimicrobial resistance of diseases has
increased dramatically in the last decade, making a growing number
of infections virtually untreatable.
</P>
<P>
Some bacteria have become resistant to as many as 10 drugs.
During the last 10 years, growth in the number of drug-resistant
bacteria outpaced the development of new antimicrobials, said WHO
in its annual report of 1996 published on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The situation means that people with infections are ill for
longer time, more likely to die and that disease epidemics are
prolonged.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it implies that drugs that cost millions of dollars
to produce and take years to reach the market, have only a limited
effective life span, the gap between infection and control being
widening.
</P>
<P>
The global antimicrobial resistance crisis, WHO said, "is
having a deadly impact on the control of diseases such as
tuberculosis, malaria, cholera, dysentery and pneumonia", which
together killed over 10 million people each year.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the drug-resistance in bacteria, WHO said all
bacteria have an inherent flexibility allowing them to eventually
evolve genes that make them resistant to any antimicrobial.
</P>
<P>
The strains of pneumonia, for example, were once all
susceptible to penicillin, but are currently resistant to it in up
to 18 percent of the cases in the United States and 40 percent in
South Africa, and are becoming resistant to many other commonly
used antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
WHO said doctors worldwide are losing some of the most useful
and affordable antibiotics against it, which is a major cause of
death in children through acute respiratory infections.
</P>
<P>
Antibiotic resistance worsens the worldwide problem of
hospital-acquired infections, said WHO, blaming it for up to 60
percent of an annual total of some 2 million such cases in the
United Sates alone, including about 70,000 related deaths.
</P>
<P>
Among the many most common bacteria causing hospital
infections, which are increasingly drug-resistant, WHO reported.
Enterococci, cause of a host of complications, has developed
resistance to all drugs but vancomycin, which is very expensive.
</P>
<P>
Even its resistance to vancomycin has developed in the last
decade, WHO added. Some of the most prevalent hospital infections
would be untreatable given emergence of vancomycin-resistant
strains of some of the common bacteria causing infections in
hospital patients "They are used by too many people to treat the
wrong kind of infection, in the wrong dosage", it said in the
report.
</P>
<P>
Substandard and counterfeit drugs short of adequate amounts of
active ingredients further exacerbate the problem.
</P>
<P>
WHO also held the enormous use of antimicrobials in animal food
responsible for the crisis. It said over half the global total
output of antimicrobials is used in farm animals, for disease
prevention or growth promotion.
</P>
<P>
Drug-resistant microbes are passed through the food chain to
men, where they may cause disease or transfer the resistance to
human pathogens, said WHO.

<HEADLINE> Global Average Life Expectancy over 65 Years in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A World Health Organization (WHO)
report issued today showed that globally, average life expectancy
at birth was more than 65 years in 1995, representing an increase
of more than three years since 1985.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1996 World Health Report of the WHO, the life
expectancy gap between the industrialized and the developing world
has narrowed to 13.3 years in 1995 from 25 years in 1955. But the
gap between least developed and other developing countries has
widened from seven years to some 13 years in the same period.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, average life expectancy at birth was over 77 years in
developed countries, 64 years in developing countries, and about
52 years in least developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The world's lowest life expectancy at birth is in Sierra Leone,
at only 40 years, about half that of Japan, which has the the
world's highest life expectancy, at 79.7 years.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, life expectancy in Africa as a whole
has increased by 4.5 years since the early 1980s, with an average
of 53 years in 1995. Eighteen African countries have life
expectancy below 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Globally, the number of countries with a life expectancy at
birth of over 60 years has increased from at least 98, with a
total population of 2.7 billion, in 1980 to at least 120, with a
total population of 4.9 billion, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
On average, women today can expect to live over four years
longer than men, 67.2 versus 63 years. The female advantage is
greatest in Europe, almost eight more years, and smallest in
Southeast Asia, where it is just one year, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Current Population Growth Rate Lowest since World War II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
said on Monday that the global population is currently
experiencing the lowest annual growth rate since the World War II:
1.6 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1996 World Health Report released by the WHO
on Monday, the growth rate of the global population is expected to
decline further to 1.3 percent a year by 2010, and 0.5 percent by
2050.
</P>
<P>
With a total of about 5.7 billion people in mid-1995, the
global population is projected to reach 7.9 billion in 2020, and
9.8 billion in 2050.
</P>
<P>
By 2050, the 48 least developed countries in the world will
have a population of about 1.7 billion, or 17 percent of the total
population, compared to about 589 million, or about 10 percent of
the global population today.
</P>
<P>
The developing world as a whole will have a population of 8.5
billion in 2050, representing 86 percent of the global population.
</P>
<P>
The WHO report also showed that about 2.6 billion people, or 45
percent of the global population, were living in urban areas. The
proportion is expected to reach 60 percent by the year 2025.
Thirty three of the world's biggest cities will have a combined
population of more than 500 million people.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
said on Monday that the world's total fertility rate has fallen by
more than a third in the last 30 years mainly due to the
increasing use of contraceptives by both women and men.
</P>

According to the 1996 World Health Report issued by the WHO on
Monday, women had an average of 4.7 babies between 1950 and 1970.
The average declined rapidly to 3.7 births by 1980, to 3.2 by
1990, and is three today.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the use of contraceptives, higher age at marriage
has also contributed to lowering fertility rates in some
countries, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But it also pointed out that the fertility rates have not
fallen uniformly worldwide. While the rate in industrialized
countries is only 1.8 births, it is 3.1 births in developing
countries and 5.6 in the least developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The least developed countries are lagging at least 20 years
behind other developing nations and most of them have not even
begun to see a sustainable decline in fertility, the WHO report
noted.
</P>
<P>
With the world's total fertility rate falling, the annual
number of births has actually risen during 1980-1995 by 12 percent
because of the increase in the number of women in the reproductive
age group.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, about 139 million babies were born in
1995, including 16 million in the industrialized world, 25 million
in the least developed countries and 98 million in other
developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Washington to Hire More Police Officers: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Washington D.C. and Prince
George's County are planning to hire and train a total of 400
officers in the next year, the metropolitan's largest round of
police hiring in a decade.
</P>
<P>
Prince George's police have launched a campaign to hire 116
officers in addition to the 24 recruits who entered the county's
academy last week.
</P>
<P>
The District is planning to rehire 50 retired police officers
this summer and select 200 new recruits by October, The Washington
Post reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Officials said 25 recruits are in the D.C. academy now and will
hit the streets in the fall.
</P>
<P>
These new officers will be working in the two area
jurisdictions with the highest crime rates, the report said.
Although violent crime fell in the District last year, overall
crime in the city climbed about 11 per cent. In Prince George's
County, violent crime and overall crime rates increased about
seven percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Some other suburban police departments are also hiring, but in
small numbers, the Post reported.
