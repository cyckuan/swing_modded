dead bodies behind me pushed me over the cliff and into the stream.
I was lucky because all of the dead bodies fell on top of me.''

involved in the shootings in Littleton, Colo., had played violent
computer games and that one of them had posted descriptions of

mysterious corners of their children's lives. For many, it was the

Supplying many of these groups is a growing disaster industry, a

ADELE WOODHOUSE ERB SULLIVAN, 91, D.A.R. LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adele Woodhouse Erb Sullivan, who was president general of the
National Society Daughters of the American Revolution in the 1960s,
died on April 22 in Wilton, Conn., at the home of her daughter,
Nancy Thorne. She was 91 and a longtime resident of Scarsdale, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sullivan was probably best known for her well-publicized
trip to Vietnam, at the invitation of Gen. William Westmoreland, in
1968. At one point during her tour, two American soldiers spied her
getting out of a helicopter in a central highlands combat zone.
``Look, Mom is coming up the hill,'' one of the soldiers was
reported to have quipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``That trip to Vietnam meant a great deal to the national
society,'' said Sarah King of Murfreesboro, Tenn., who was
president general of the DAR from 1983 until 1986. ``Membership
grew to 188,000 because of her special leadership and knowledge of
public relations.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization's membership peaked at about 212,000 in the
mid-1980s, and is now about 175,000, according to Mrs. King. ``We
will never again have a leader like her,'' she said. ``She was
dynamic, articulate and interested in everything in American
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Adele Woodhouse, who was born in Trenton, N.J., was a descendant
of early Colonial Pennsylvania settlers. The direct lineal ancestor
who gave her entry into the Daughters of the American Revolution
was Israel Matson of Philadelphia. She was educated in Quaker
schools and at Rider College.
</P>
<P>
   She joined the DAR in 1930, and during World War II, she was a
leader in the organization's war work, maintaining a service booth
in the Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan for the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, she became a state regent, directing 177 DAR chapters
with 15,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, she was elected recording secretary general of the
national society, and in 1959, she was elected first vice president
general. She was elected president general in 1965, serving one
term until 1968, when she was made an honorary president general
for life.
</P>
<P>
   Her first husband, Harold Erb of Garden City, N.Y., died in
1957, and her second husband, William Sullivan Jr. of Scarsdale,
died in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her daughter, Mrs. Sullivan is survived by two
granddaughters and two great-grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: MILOSEVIC'S PEACE OVERTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, May 3:
</P>
<P>
   After more than a month of grim tidings from Yugoslavia, the
release of three captive American soldiers is heartening. But
Slobodan Milosevic's good-will gesture alone is not sufficient
reason to suspend the air war. As President Clinton rightly noted
yesterday, Christopher Stone, Andrew Ramirez and Steven Gonzales
are headed home after 32 days in Serbian custody, but more than
600,000 ethnic Albanians expelled from Kosovo cannot yet return to
their homeland. NATO leaders should intensify their diplomatic
efforts, but until Milosevic takes the steps necessary to restore
peace to Kosovo, there should be no bombing pause.
</P>
<P>
   That is not meant to belittle Milosevic's decision, or the Rev.
Jesse Jackson's role in gaining freedom for the three soldiers and
his appeal for a bombing moratorium. Clearly, Milosevic is
signaling that he would like to find a way to end the war. Jackson,
once again defying diplomatic convention, has brought at least a
moment of hope to an otherwise depressing conflict. The propaganda
benefits Milosevic may harvest from Jackson's trip are easily
outweighed by the safe return of three young Americans to their
families, and Jackson deserves the nation's thanks.
</P>
<P>
   But the weekend's developments do not change the larger picture.
The Serbian assault has not abated, and tens of thousands of
displaced ethnic Albanians continue to stream into Albania and
Macedonia, many with credible accounts of Serbian atrocities. While
Milosevic has modified some of his peace terms, he has so far
offered allies an unacceptable deal. His proposal to meet with
Clinton is diplomatic grandstanding and was properly rejected by
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's idea of a political settlement still falls well
short of the minimal conditions that must prevail in Kosovo when
the war ends. Though he has invited the refugees to return home,
Milosevic has so far refused to accept the presence of a well-armed
international peacekeeping force, which would be required to
prevent further ethnic bloodshed. Nor has he clearly offered to
call off his attack on Kosovo and start withdrawing his forces in
return for a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   There is reason to think these and other disagreements with NATO
can be narrowed with intensive diplomacy. Milosevic in recent weeks
has shifted from a flat refusal to consider any foreign military
presence in Kosovo to acceptance in principle of an unarmed or
lightly armed force with some NATO representation. Russia, which is
now playing a central and constructive peacemaking role, seems
willing to approve an adequately armed force under U.N. authority.
NATO troops will need to play some role in peacekeeping, as will
Russian forces, and it ought to be possible to find a balance
acceptable to all parties.
</P>
<P>
   With improving weather allowing NATO to escalate the air war,
Milosevic may eventually prove more flexible on other issues as
well, including a restoration of the substantial degree of
political autonomy Kosovo enjoyed until 1989. Boris Yeltsin has
drafted his own proposals, which are to be presented to Clinton
today by Viktor Chernomyrdin, Moscow's special Balkan envoy.
Certainly every diplomatic opening should be pursued. But the
bombing provides the incentive for Milosevic to give up his deadly
game in Kosovo, and it should not be suspended until he does.

GORDON HAS STUMPED CRITICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM GAZZOLO  
 Inland Valley Daily Bulletin  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ Jeff Gordon lives.
</P>
<P>
   The much-talked-about, much-hyped and, by many, much-hoped-for
death of Gordon's racing career is on hold. Talk that Gordon's
better days were behind him can rest in peace. That was just the
wishful thinking of his detractors, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR fans will have to put up with him for a long time to
come. Gordon proved that there is nothing wrong with him, his car
or his crew that an easy Sunday drive around Fontana couldn't cure.
The man racing fans love to hate, whose victories they boo and
defeats they cheer, simply drove away from the field to win his
second California 500 in three years.
</P>
<P>
   And he did it in a way that will cause those who dislike him to
dislike him even more. Gordon won by having the fastest car, by
being the best driver and by having the best pit crew. There was no
one even close. He made a mockery of the race, tearing up the
California Speedway as if it were his own personal driveway.
</P>
<P>
   That fact, more than anything else, will stick in the craw of
many good ol' boys who had hoped Gordon's domination of the sport
built from bootleggers' runs from the law was over. Guess again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exciting,'' said Gordon. ``We were able to put our
troubles behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Those troubles include three wrecks and three races where he was
left standing in the garage when kisses were being given to the
winner. Those woes also had many believing Gordon's best was no
longer good enough to win. They saw the setbacks not as chinks in
the armour, but deep cuts to his flesh. More important, they saw it
as the end of putting up with the young gun who had stolen their
sport from southern gentlemen who spit tobacco, drink beer and
whittle wood. Those are folks who are not dealing in reality.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the facts: Gordon's win Sunday was his third of the
season, more than any other driver. That's three victories in 10
races. Gordon lurks fourth in the points standings, just 200 behind
leader Jeff Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is still the most recognizable figure in Winston Cup and
is the crossover star to mainstream sports fans. And most
importantly, he is still the best race car driver around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff Gordon is the man to beat, no question about it.'' That's
from somebody who should know, Dale Jarrett, who started second
Sunday. By the way, Jarrett's words came before the race. It became
obvious that he was still the best with about 50 laps to go when
Gordon pulled away from the field after his final pit stop. He
stopped for gas and tires with other leaders, up by almost two
seconds; he returned to the track ahead by over four seconds.
That's a full-service station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything went perfect on that stop,'' said crew chief Ray
Evernham.
</P>
<P>
   That has not been the case recently, as Gordon has seen more
than his share of problems. Still, the crew and driver never got
down even as the buzzards circled above.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you win, you can't go around and pat yourself on the
back, and you can't slit your wrists when you lose,'' said
Evernham. For Gordon, it was just a matter of things coming
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we just have things go our way, if we just have some good
fortune instead of misfortune, we can win races,'' said Gordon.
``That's what happened to us today. ``If we can get some
consistency, we'll be a factor in this championship.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an understatement from a man who has won three of the
last four points titles, including the last two. It is also not the
type of thing those who consider Gordon an overexposed punk like to
hear. But once again they had better get used to it. Sunday only
proved that Jeff Gordon is still the man when it comes to Winston
Cup. Just don't consider it any type of rebirth. Rather, call it a
return to the norm.

ON SEATTLE VISIT, PAT BUCHANAN BLASTS CHINA'S WTO BID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ China is ``not remotely qualified'' to become a member
of the World Trade Organization and the United States should not
yield to ``bribes'' such as those offered by Premier Zhu Rongji on
his recent visit to the United States, Republican presidential
candidate Patrick Buchanan said Sunday in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Describing U.S. trade negotiators as ``too weak and wimpish,''
Buchanan pledged that if elected president, he would ``demand
complete access to Chinese markets'' as the trade-off for China's
continuing to sell its products here.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan will appear at Port of Seattle docks on Monday as a way
of dramatizing the United States' $58 billion trade deficit with
China, and what he said is a decline of U.S. exports and lack of
vigor in dealing with U.S. trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is making his case in a corner of the United States
that has been a bastion of support for U.S.-China trade.
</P>
<P>
   Premier Jiang Zemin once dramatized the importance of his
country to Boeing jet sales by visiting a Boeing worker's home in
Marysville, Wash. A key inducement to WTO membership, recently
offered by Zhu, was a lifting of China's ban on imports of wheat
from the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan said Sunday that as a Republican president, he
would not hesitate to challenge the GOP's traditional corporate
allies.
</P>
<P>
   He even personalized the argument with a reference to Boeing
Chairman Phil Condit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transnational corporations, which are entirely correct
calling themselves that, have a right to make their case and defend
their interests,'' Buchanan argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when they shut down factories, lay off American employees,
kill jobs _ and make their parts in China _ it is the duty of the
American president to look after American workers, not Mr. Condit
and his executives.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, a television commentator and former aide to Presidents
Nixon and Reagan, is making his third try for the White House. Both
Reagan and Bob Dole captured the GOP nominations on their third
attempt. But despite his surprise early victories in 1996 _
including upsetting Dole in the New Hampshire primary _ Buchanan is
still considered a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   He is, however, what Reagan once called a ``conviction
politician,'' a robust conservative at the onset of a political
season in which some fellow Republican presidential candidates are
proposing to soft-pedal positions on which the party has been
identified.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Sunday, Buchanan also:
</P>
<P>
   - Decried the loss of 350,000 American manufacturing jobs last
year and warned that the country's status as a superpower is in
jeopardy if its ability to make things continues to decline;
</P>
<P>
   - Claimed President Clinton is ``scapegoating gun owners and
sportsmen'' for the Littleton, Colo., school massacre. Clinton has
proposed reinstatement of the Brady Bill's three-day wait on
handgun purchases, to require trigger locks on gun purchases and to
ban ownership of handguns by those under 21.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of expanding gun control, Clinton should focus on ``the
cultural polluters of the entertainment industry who put these
ideas in children's heads,'' Buchanan argued. He acidly noted that
some of the alleged polluters have been among Clinton's most
generous contributors.
</P>
<P>
   - Warned that the Republican Party would ``lose its soul'' as
well as its most dedicated volunteers if it ``turns a deaf ear on
the silent screams of the unborn.'' Any abandonment of the GOP's
opposition to abortion would simply be designed ``to appease people
who never voted for us in the beginning,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan also warned that the GOP cannot count on the pro-life
movement to stay in the fold if its cause is soft-pedaled. If
opposition to abortion is modified or abandoned, ``the Republican
Party will demean itself and call into being a new party,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   - Buchanan also declared himself opposed to any dismantling of
the Northwest's hydroelectric system to save or restore salmon
runs. He was asked about proposals to breach four dams on the lower
Snake River.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, salmon are important, but people come first,'' he
added. ``I adhere to the biblical idea that good things were put
here by the Lord for the wise use of mankind, which is required to
be a good steward of what has been bestowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think the good steward needs hydroelectricity more
than a few more salmon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is a candidate who does not hesitate to tell you which
side he is on. For instance, he decried what he called ``the
demeaning, mocking and demonizing'' of traditional American values
in popular entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional Catholics and fundamentalist Christians, in
particular, are targets of these outrages,'' he added. ``It is time
for decent people to fight back with boycotts, and by using the
political process. The president of the United States has a bully
pulpit. It should be deployed on the side of decent people.''

EDITORIAL: SELLING THE PEOPLE'S GARDENS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, May 3:
</P>
<P>
   Despite months of discussions and last week's highly public
arrest of a demonstrator dressed as a sunflower, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani is ready to auction off more than 100 community gardens,
many in the poorest neighborhoods in New York. Odd lots, strange
sizes, these bits and pieces of city territory have become
makeshift mini-parks, garden plots or community meeting grounds in
areas where such amenities are scarce.
</P>
<P>
   So why does Giuliani want to deprive the already deprived of a
few patches of green? New York City owns too much land, he has
said, and the lots could earn revenues, from the auction that might
add $3 million to the city's $2.1 billion surplus and also by
returning these lots to the tax rolls. Selling 100 of the 700
gardens may make sense on the budget charts in City Hall, but in
the neighborhoods, where these plots can be like an oasis in a
tarmac desert, this sale is shortsighted in the extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Most community gardens were lent to neighborhoods years ago with
the understanding that the city would take them back someday for
housing or other civic needs. Giving up gardens for much-needed
public housing was a hard enough choice. That has already been
done. Now communities fear that these next plots will be bought by
speculators who will convert flower beds into parking lots or
dumps. So, the Trust for Public Lands has offered $2 million for 75
lots, about 27 of which are headed for the auction bloc on May 13.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani should halt the auction and either pursue negotiations
with private groups like the trust or find other ways to keep these
edens blooming. This cavalier sale would add a mite to the city's
lush budget, but only by subtracting vital open spaces in the very
neighborhoods that need them.

EDITORIAL: CORRUPT GIFT-GIVING MADE EASIER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, May 3:
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with ambiguous language in the federal criminal
statute that outlaws gratuities to public officials, the Supreme
Court responded last week with a 9-to-0 ruling that, while not
unreasonable in the abstract, will have the practical effect of
making it hard, if not impossible, to prosecute cases of improper
gift-giving.
</P>
<P>
   Before the court was an appeal by the independent counsel Donald
Smaltz, who three years ago obtained a conviction of an
agricultural cooperative, Sun-Diamond Growers of California, for
bestowing $5,900 worth of tennis tickets, luggage and other gifts
on then-Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy. There was ample evidence
to show that these gifts were meant to curry favor with Espy, who
was acquitted on related charges by a federal jury.
</P>
<P>
   The gratuities law makes it a crime to ``give anything of
value'' to a federal official ``because of any official act
performed or to be performed in the future.'' But last week, the
Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the law provides criminal
sanctions only where prosecutors can prove a link between a gift
and a specific official act _ in essence imposing the same sort of
quid pro quo requirement that makes the more serious offense of
bribery so hard to prove.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate danger is that gift-loving members of Congress
will try to use the new decision as a wedge to weaken existing
House and Senate rules restricting gifts to lawmakers. Instead,
Congress should concentrate on strengthening those rules, and
amending the illegal gratuities statute to cover all but the most
trivial gifts to high officials _ taking a lot more care this time
in the drafting.

NEAL HARDY, 84, HEADED FHA UNDER KENNEDY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Kan., Calif., Wash., Mo., Conn.)  (mk) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Neal Hardy, who headed the Federal Housing Administration in the
Kennedy administration, died on April 15 at My Country Home Adult
Congregate Living Facility in Osteen, Fla. He was 84 and had
previously lived in Orange City, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy was an executive of the National Association of Home
Builders when President Kennedy nominated him to head the FHA in
1961. The agency was a predecessor of the Department of Housing and
Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy became known as a progressive administrator, shifting the
emphasis of federal housing to the cities from the suburbs,
promoting low-income housing and helping to plan an executive
order, issued in November 1961, that barred discrimination in
federally subsidized housing.
</P>
<P>
   The housing agency and the Veterans Administration both issued
rules against racial and religious discrimination in housing. At
that time, the two agencies together were insuring or guaranteeing
mortgages on about a quarter of the private housing built in the
United States each year.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy also began a program providing mortgage insurance to
nonprofit and limited-profit organizations for the construction and
rehabilitation of homes for low- and moderate-income families.
</P>
<P>
   He resigned in January 1963 and moved to New York City, where he
worked in the public affairs program of the Ford Foundation. In
1964, he was named deputy administrator for rehabilitation in the
city's Rent and Rehabilitation Administration, which was mounting a
drive to rehabilitate slums.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy was an assistant administrator in the city's Housing and
Development Administration from 1968 to 1972. He was executive
director of New York City Rehabilitation Mortgage Insurance Corp.,
a government concern, from 1972 until he retired in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Ottawa, Kan., the son of Cleo Hardy and the
former Irene Johnson. In 1936, he received a bachelor's degree from
the University of Kansas. He served in the Army in World War II,
did intelligence work and became assistant military attache at the
U.S. Embassy in London.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, Hardy began working for the Housing and Home Finance
Agency, the parent of the FHA, in Washington. He stayed there until
he moved to the home builders' association in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   His 1938 marriage to Dorothy Margaret Cortelyou ended in
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 38 years, Sallee, of De Land,
Fla.; two sons, Neal Jr. of Marina Del Ray, Calif., and Van of
Redmond, Wash.; a stepson, Scott Lee Bashaw of St. Louis; five
grandchildren, and a sister, Polly Roehm of Weston, Conn.

LABONTE PLEASED WITH PERFORMANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL HELMS  
 Inland Valley Daily Bulletin  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ Bobby Labonte said he knew what was coming
after Saturday's practice sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon looked dominating then, too. Labonte just hoped he'd
be somewhere near the front when the California 500 neared its
conclusion. He got his wish because he was the main one chasing
Gordon for a good stretch late in the race before he was overtaken
by second-place finisher Jeff Burton.
</P>
<P>
   But third-place was more than enough to make Labonte pleased
when the race was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Gordon would be tough to beat after practice,'' Labonte
said. ``(Gordon and Jeff Burton) were the class of the field, and
we were able to hang in there with them towards the end. (Team
owner Joe Gibbs) should be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, who started in the fourth position, said his car got
better as the race went on, but that the top two cars were simply
better.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte led two times during the race for a total of 14 laps,
but he knew Gordon and Burton had their cars running better for
most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``My car wasn't as good on a long run early on. I got about a
half-lap down and we made a lot of adjustments under yellow and got
the car a lot better,'' Labonte said. ``We came away with a good
finish, a top-five, and hey, that's good. They (Gordon and Burton)
just beat everybody everywhere. At the beginning, heck, I couldn't
even see them.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, who is fourth in the points race, has had mixed results
in Fontana. He was sixth in 1997 and wound up 38th last year in
what he considered to be a faster car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first Cup race here, we didn't run that good, but we got a
good finish on fuel mileage, so we were lucky with that,'' Labonte
said. ``Last year, we had a better car, but we actually blew the
motor up on the first lap.''
</P>
<P>
   He had a much better run in this year's race. Labonte had the
second-fastest practice lap Saturday, and he led early in Sunday's
race. He said his car ran the best just past the halfway point of
the event _ he led for three laps until Gordon passed him on Lap
141 _ but his car's performance fell off a bit after his last pit
stop. That's when he fell far behind Gordon and couldn't hold off
Burton.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get passed, there's usually a reason why you got
passed,'' he said. ``We were better with the set of tires before
that last run. We lost some grip there at the end of the race
compared to the last set of tires before that. We were really good
on about a 15-lap run, but after that we'd typically fall back.
Towards the end, we made some adjustments so we got better toward
the end of our runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte is enjoying a successful season and Sunday's third-place
finish was his sixth top-five placing in 1999. He remains fourth in
the points race after a career-best sixth-place finish last year.
He won a pair of races last year and has won a pair of poles this
year, but is still looking for his first win of '99. He made a good
run at it Sunday, but fell short for a very good reason. The two
cars ahead of him were better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got no complaints,'' he said. ``I'm happy with our
finish.'' Gordon and Burton were, too.''

CHARLES WARREN, 92, PHYSICIAN AND MOUNTAINEER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Warren, a British physician who tried three times to
scale Mount Everest in the 1930s, died on March 30 in his home in
Essex, England. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Warren brought the sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay to the attention
of British mountaineers. Norgay made history in 1953 when he and
Edmund Hillary became the first men to reach Everest's peak.
</P>
<P>
   Warren, whose death was first reported last weekend, himself
came to the attention of those organizing the British Everest
expeditions after a successful 1933 climb to the summit of
Bhagirathi III, in the Gangatori district of the Himalayas.
</P>
<P>
   His initial attempt to reach the top of Everest, in 1935, led by
the explorer Eric Shipton, was notable mainly for the discovery of
the body of Maurice Wilson, a soldier-turned-mystic who believed
prayer and dedication would lead him to the top of the world.
Warren helped bury Wilson in a crevasse.
</P>
<P>
   That first failed mission was also noteworthy because Warren,
the physician for the expedition, was impressed by Norgay and
invited him to stay in the doctor's home in Felsted in Essex.
Norgay served as a porter for Warren on all three of his attempts
at Everest.
</P>
<P>
   Warren, a cautious climber, also served as physician to British
expeditions that were turned back, mostly by weather, in 1936 and
1938.
</P>
<P>
   Warren was born in London and educated at Eastbourne College and
Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he studied medicine. He
specialized in pediatrics, helping to develop ultraviolet
treatments for infants suffering from jaundice.
</P>
<P>
   His wife died before him, and he leaves no immediate survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Though Warren never tried to climb Everest again after his three
attempts, he kept scaling mountains around the world, even when he
was past 70. A hike to the top of Cuillin Ridge on the Isle of Skye
in Scotland when he was 72 and his last rock climb, in the Lake
District on his 80th birthday, were both capped with champagne
toasts.

MONTOYA CAPTURES BOSCH SPARK PLUG 200 FOR SECOND STRAIGHT CART WIN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZARETH, Pa. _ Juan Montoya's quick rise to Champ Car
prominence is reminiscent of another aggressive and confident
driver who seemingly came from out of nowhere to win consecutive
championships in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably not too early to start comparing Montoya to his
predecessor, the two-time champion Alex Zanardi, who left Chip
Ganassi Racing after last season for the twists and turns of the
Formula One circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya and Zanardi are similar on many levels. Behind the
wheel, they are precise and calculating. Both are self-confident,
sometimes even cocky. And now, they have something else in common:
success very early in their CART careers.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, with the assistance of Chip Ganassi Racing's famously
fast pit crew, Montoya dominated the Bosch Spark Plug 200 at
Nazareth Speedway from start to finish, taking the FedEx Series
points lead with his second straight CART victory.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year old rookie, who put his Honda-Reynard on victory
lane two weeks ago in Long Beach, Calif., started Sunday's race
from the pole and led for 210 of the 225 laps, finishing more than
five seconds ahead of P.J. Jones, in a Ford-Swift, and Paul Tracy,
in a Honda-Reynard.
</P>
<P>
   After rubbing tires with Helio Castro-Neves on Lap 145, Montoya
came onto pit lane under caution after Jones' car spun out of
control. Montoya's pit crew pulled off their tires-and-gas stop
nearly three seconds faster than Castro-Neves', giving Montoya all
the advantage he needed to win the race. The bumping incident
between Castro-Neves and Montoya was the only excitement in what
was a ho-hum finish to a ho-hum race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they do, but they are pretty quick,'' said
Montoya, who won consecutive victories as a rookie for the first
time since Nigel Mansell won at Michigan and Loudon in 1993.
Mansell went on to capture the PPG championship that season and
earn rookie of the year honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had quite a good car today,'' said Montoya, who averaged
120.225 miles an hour around the mile tri-oval. ``I lost the lead
twice to Helio in traffic, but both times my guys in the pits got
me back out front. They got this win for me. I was just trying to
keep it on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Montoya, who was born in Bogota, Colombia, made a name for
himself on Europe's road courses. So like Zanardi, Montoya left
Europe for Chip Ganassi Racing's team, which has dominated CART in
the 1990s and has won the last three series titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to be on top of the points,'' Montoya said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason Sunday's race lacked the wheel-to-wheel
action that is normally found in CART races was due to the
aerodynamic changes the teams were required to make on the cars.
</P>
<P>
   All week, drivers complained about the sanctioning body's
mandate that the cars use smaller aerodynamic wings on CART's short
ovals, like the one here at Nazareth. The shorter front and rear
wings are designed to slow the cars down by creating less
down-force, thus making the drivers slow down in the turns, as the
cars now tend to lose traction.
</P>
<P>
   The cars did run slower and more loose. Montoya's qualifying
time of 173.755 m.p.h. was more than 11 m.p.h. slower than Patrick
Carpentier's record speed of 184.896 mph set at last season's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really single file,'' said Tracy, who finished in the
top three for the fifth time in nine starts at Nazareth. ``The cars
were really spread out. It wasn't much like Champ Cars are all
about. We have to figure out how to make the cars better when they
are in close to one another, wheel to wheel, to make passing
easier. It's definitely hurting the sport.''

COLORADO TEEN RETREAT TURNS TO HEALING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY ETTENBOROUGH  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ The teenagers who lost 13 friends in the
Columbine High School murders danced and sang ``The'' ``Happy
Song'' on Sunday morning at St. Frances Cabrini Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   As the band jammed, the 75 or so teens sang out: ``Everybody's
singing now, 1-2-3, `cause we're so happy . . . And unseen angels
celebrate, for joy is in this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Joy, for the first time since April 20, had replaced sadness,
fear, anger and myriad other emotions for many of the teenagers who
took part in the retreat that began Friday night at the church,
which is only two miles from Columbine High.
</P>
<P>
   The retreat was supposed to be for the 91 members of the 1999
confirmation class. Daniel Mauser, who died at Columbine, was
supposed to be there.
</P>
<P>
   After the shootings, the church opened the retreat to any teen
who wanted to come _ nearly 200 took part _ and changed the theme
to ``We survived. We will prevail. We have hope to carry on.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Frances' high school group, Life Teen, is part of the
national Life Teen program that began in Mesa. Seven adults from
the East Valley flew to Littleton to help with the retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the St. Frances teens know the victims, but several
_ Mauser, Lauren Townsend, Rachel Scott and Matthew Ketcher and two
others who were wounded _ were in their Life Teen group. Nearly
everyone at the retreat knew someone who died and some knew them
all.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday morning, the teenagers cheered and hugged and
laughed and began to heal, they said. The funerals are over and
they have been reminded of the presence of Jesus in their lives and
in the lives of their friends who died, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brain has just been a mess,'' said 16-year-old Caitlin
Whitney. She was in the courtyard when the shooting began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been able to focus enough to pray more than `God,
please help me, please help me get through this,' '' she said.
``Just being here this weekend, I was able to focus and able to
make a connection. I actually felt like I was talking to God, and
he was hearing me. It made me feel satisfied, like I'm OK. I will
be fine now.''
</P>
<P>
   The teenagers have a lot to be happy about, said Jessica Mestas,
15. The community is closer, more people are seeking God, and fewer
people died than the killers intended, the teens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was the devil's great plan, it's all back in his
face,'' Mestas said. ``I think a lot of good has come out.''
</P>
<P>
   When the retreat opened Friday, the teens, who came from several
area high schools, ran the gamut of emotions. Some were sick of
hearing about Columbine. Others hadn't come to terms with their
feelings. All needed a breath of fresh air. The weekend was a mix
of fun _ pickup basketball games in the gym, rowdy music and
humorous skits _ and serious talks and prayer.
</P>
<P>
   There was time to spend with one or two friends tucked away in a
quiet stairwell, talking and consoling each other and time to
giggle and eat cookies. Counselors were on hand for private and
group sessions, and the confirmation class continued its work,
preparing for Tuesday when its members will be confirmed into the
faith.
</P>
<P>
   The speakers reminded the teens that God was there in the midst
of the evil. Law enforcement officials have said they don't
understand why 200 or 300 didn't die, said Steve Angrisano, a
national Catholic speaker and a member of St. Frances.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were flown by angels out of that school. Don't miss that.
Make your life count,'' Angrisano said.
</P>
<P>
   They were reminded of the martyrs of the faith, including Cassie
Bernall, the 17-year-old who was shot and killed after saying yes
when asked, ``Do you believe in God?''
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Schnurr, who worships at St. Frances, was in the library
when the shooting began. She was hit and began to pray. She also
was asked by one of the shooters if she believed in God, and she
said yes. It appeared she was going to be shot again, but something
distracted the shooter and she survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a miracle,'' said Bobby Ratzi, 16, who was in
the same confirmation group as Mauser. ``People say God never does
miracles. That was a smack in the face. You can't miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Three walls in the St. Frances Life Teen room are covered with
posters and cards of condolence from Life Teen members around the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The posters have hearts and angels drawn on them. Many quote the
Bible: ``We believe that Jesus died and rose again and so we
believe that God will take back with Jesus those who have died
believing in him.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what the St. Frances teenagers believe, they said, and
that is their hope and their joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have friends who don't believe in God. For them, it's over.
They'll never see their friends again. I don't know what I'd do if
I wouldn't be able to see my friends again,'' Whitney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to have patience,'' added Sarah Arzola, 17, who
was good friends with victim Rachel Scott. ``When I do die, I'm
going to see Rachel again. We all say we are lucky to be here. In a
way, they are even luckier to go to heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Catholics believe the real presence of Christ is in the bread of
the Eucharist, called the blessed sacrament. On Saturday night, the
lights were dimmed and Father Fred Gaglia brought out the blessed
sacrament, encased in glass, and the teens and adults fell to their
knees for adoration and prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Music played softly as Gaglia touched the sacrament to the
forehead of each teen, asking for God's blessing on them. He asked
that each one be filled with whatever gift of the spirit was
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Some cried. Some appeared to faint. Others had their tears
turned to laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a way that God could show them visibly his great love
and concern for them. Now it is a living reality for them,'' said
Gaglia, the western regional Life Teen coordinator who is based in
Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Kuenstler, 15, had left the class of Dave Sanders, the
teacher who was killed, just before the shooting started. She heard
shots in the hall and has had a difficult time since, she said. The
weekend, and especially Saturday night, were a help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a relief for me because of all the stuff we've been
going through,'' she said. ``I could just feel the holy spirit in
me. It was really cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Bell, 15, couldn't stop laughing Saturday night. She felt
happy, she said. Bell had buried her face in her hands and cried
after they had prayed for Mauser the night before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was God's way to tell me to stop mourning and to go on from
here,'' she said. ``The whole weekend calmed everyone down and made
everyone feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Beckman, the Life Teen director at the church, challenged
the teenagers to forgive the killers, Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold, and be examples to the community in finding forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do walk away from this and don't embrace forgiveness
and God's mercy, you become Eric and Dylan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``God has chosen us for a mission and he is going to give us
every tool and every weapon we need to bring glory and honor to him
through this. Go rock your world!'' Beckman said on Sunday at the
end of the retreat. The teenagers cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Then, T-shirts were handed out. On the front were the words
``Survive, prevail, hope'' and ``70X7.'' On the back, ``We
survived. We will prevail. We have hope to carry on!'' and the
symbol of a cross.
</P>
<P>
   In the gospel of Matthew, a man asks Jesus how many times he
should forgive his brother. Seven times? Jesus says, ``Seventy
times seven.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As Christians, we are called to forgive always. That's got to
be a rallying point for us,'' Beckman said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the teenagers pulled the T-shirts over their shirts
immediately. The rallying had begun. &QL;

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE WOODLANDS _ He still wears his wedding ring. Of course he does.
Why wouldn't he? Renay's gone, but she's not really gone, not from
his heart, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Golf, meanwhile, fills some of the tangible void. It keeps him
going. You can't stop living.
</P>
<P>
   You can't stop loving, either, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``Renay,'' Stuart Appleby said, ``will be with me forever, no
doubt, in anything I do. And she'll be there to help, nothing but
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Appleby lost his wife of less than three years last July.
Sunday, he won his first PGA Tour event since that unfathomably
tragic accident outside of London's Waterloo Station. While his
victory in no way cancels out his personal loss, it at least
provides a respite, a fleeting break in the relentless monotony of
his sadness.
</P>
<P>
   The Shell Houston Open may have had greater champions in its
history, both bigger names and guys who fashioned flashier scores.
Remarkably, Appleby's final-round 71, a mere stroke better than
par, would be sufficient to erase a three-shot deficit when the
blustery afternoon began.
</P>
<P>
   But, with no offense intended toward Hal Sutton, whose
tournament it was to lose _ and he did _ Houston's often
star-crossed stop on the golf circuit has never had a champion the
swarming, teeming masses at the TPC should have pulled any harder
for than Appleby.
</P>
<P>
   See, he won't be the same again even if he wins 100 golf
tournaments. Nothing can scrape away his memory of seeing Renay
die. One minute she was carrying suitcases; the next she was a
crumpled, comatose form on the grimy asphalt, having been
accidentally crushed between two vehicles as the couple were
preparing to leave London for a holiday.
</P>
<P>
   He had just missed the cut at the British Open and was still
feeling sorry for himself. As with his peers, golf defined him, so
playing golf badly always left him in a funk. But he was about to
find out how a real funk felt.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Championship in August marked his return to competition.
He cried his way through a historically poignant news conference,
then failed to recompose himself sufficiently to earn a weekend tee
time. It has been a weekly, daily, hourly struggle since to clear
his mind enough to let his motor skills function as they did before
July 23, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Although a year-end victory at a small tournament in his native
Australia gave him hope, it didn't repair his battered mental
state. Coolum only reminded him how much he missed Renay. The event
was one he had played largely at her behest because she would go to
the beach there, or ride her bicycle. As much as anything, it was a
vacation destination more than it was a business trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a victory where I played by pure relaxation,'' he
said. ``This was work. Real work.''
</P>
<P>
   The capricious gusts kept the field from scoring Sunday. None of
the 54-hole leaders bettered Appleby's 1-under-par round. In fact,
Clarence Rose skied to 79, Joey Sindelar to 77, Frank Lickliter to
76, Loren Roberts and Sutton to 75. Hal's bogeys at 16 and 17
opened a window for Appleby, who found within himself the
wherewithal to climb through.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-foot birdie putt he rammed home at 17 effectively sealed
the deal. But he had told himself early in the morning he would
win, no two ways about it. Was Renay with him all the way? You bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gave me the strength,'' Appleby said. ``Yeah, I mean, why
not? I just felt strong. I sort of walked like I wanted this
tournament. I knew this was going to be mine, that I was going to
get this thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to be Renay (and) try to talk to myself about what I had
to do to win. The answer was: Get your act together. Try and stay
positive on the course. Believe in yourself. Believe that practice
is going to work. All the stuff I've been through is not for any
reason at all, (not) because I'm a bad person. It's not that.''
</P>
<P>
   Appleby's piercing blue eyes appear to water frequently when he
speaks of Renay, but he maintained a taciturn demeanor on the
wind-whipped Woodlands track. Although he didn't bring his ``A''
game, he did bring his brain, without which, he said, ``you can
pack your bags and go home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great victory,'' he suggested, ``in the sense that my
mind got me around more than anything else _ the opposite of the
last few months.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was Appleby's 28th birthday. Renay would be 26. Just
kids still, the two of them, with so much to look forward to. Now?
One life is done; the other must, damn the pain and the injustice
of it all, continue. To honor Renay's memory, Appleby needs to do
his job to the best of his ability. There's no profit in anything
less.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard when you lose someone you love so much,'' he said,
``but you've got to turn it around. And you have to make sure that
if anything happens, for good or bad, you have to find out in the
end that everything was for the good.''
</P>
<P>
   There was, to be sure, not an iota of good in Renay's untimely
passing. It did not happen to punish her, or him. But it happened,
so he has to cope. Winning seems as effective a means as any,
certainly better than the alternative.

COMMENTARY: ANYBODY WANT A SLIGHTLY USED FOOTBALL TEAM? 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New England Patriots have decided there is not enough money
in the world to make them move to Hartford, Conn. The Patriots'
owner, Robert Kraft, agreed back in December that Connecticut could
have the privilege of building him a $375 million stadium,
guaranteeing the sale of all the luxury seating and underwriting
virtually every other team expense except the Gatorade. But now
Kraft seems to be planning to stay in Massachusetts, even though
its offer of financial assistance is the major-league equivalent of
pocket change. We have seen this story in dozens of teen-age
movies, and Connecticut is stuck playing the spoiled cheerleader
who gets dumped at the prom.
</P>
<P>
   Dare we hope that this could be the beginning of the end for
major-league stadium extortion? Smaller cities lusting after the
cachet of big-time sports are going to think twice before they get
into a bidding war that could end in this kind of humiliation. The
Massachusetts House speaker, Thomas (``No tribute or ransom'')
Finneran, who took the heat for driving the Patriots away, now
looks like the Patrick Henry of football, if only because he had
the temerity to call Kraft ``a whiny millionaire looking for a
bribe.'' Finneran is even demanding that the Patriots reimburse the
state for part of the cost of fixing the roads and utilities around
a stadium Kraft would have to build for himself. Team owners have
always regarded these sorts of infrastructure improvements for
their sports meccas as an inherent responsibility of American
government, like schools and firefighting.
</P>
<P>
   In backing out of the Hartford deal, Kraft cited uncertainty
over a stadium completion date, but a big factor seemed to be his
fellow team owners' contempt for the size of the local TV market.
Your heart has to go out to Hartford, which has been sinking into
the status of a snakebit money pit for decades now, littered with
failed development projects of the past_ the abandoned jai alai
fronton, the near-empty indoor mall, where a hamburger stand is now
the lead tenant. The Hartford Whalers hockey team has gone South,
preferring to play before fans whose experience with ice is limited
to their refrigerator freezers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby Providence, which Hartford had always regarded with
disdain, somehow developed a lively downtown while Hartford's began
looking more and more like a ``Blade Runner'' set. To add insult to
injury, Providence got its name on the title of a TV series _ a
series with good ratings! No wonder the Connecticut state
legislators sat there salivating while Kraft told them he could put
the Hartford skyline on ``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   There was something pathetic about the eagerness of Gov. John
Rowland and the Connecticut Legislature to believe that Robert
Kraft really meant it when he enthused ``we want to partner with
Hartford!'' even as he devised a contract that gave him more escape
hatches than Houdini. It is easy to make fun of them in hindsight,
but it is' also easy to imagine New York doing the same thing,
forking over great piles of money while burbling about bringing
``Monday Night Football'' to Albany. New York's lawmakers have, by
my count, approved subsidies for at least 20 professional sports
facilities over the last half-decade, from tennis courts in
Schenectady to 10 fields for minor-league baseball. One of them was
built in Watertown for an AAA team that has already jumped ship for
a new publicly financed stadium in Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   Hartford now stands as a warning about what can happen when a
city plays ball with the whiny millionaires. ``This has to be `The
Music Man,' with Kraft in the Robert Preston role,'' said William
Curry, who ran against Rowland in 1994. ``The sports guy blows into
town and tells everybody the wonderful things he's going to do for
you. Then you give him all the money, and you don't even get the
band uniforms.''

SONICS' PLUMMET AUDIBLE LONG BEFORE THUD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The final week of the 1999 Sonics season: Bellyache,
heartbreak and an elimination loss to the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't that how the 1997-98 Sonic season ended?
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the Sonics wasted 48 games and a lot of fans'
entertainment dollars to get back to where they were.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's not exactly the same spot. This season, the Sonics
commenced their self-sabotage earlier, and their annual
season-ending loss to the Lakers came Sunday, three games before
the end of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sonics are virtually as dead as they were a year ago at
this time, when the Lakers wasted them 4-1 in the playoffs' second
round. Sunday's 91-84 loss at KeyArena left the Sonics with a
postseason hope thinner than team camaraderie, if that's possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to use the term `mathematically alive,''' said Hersey
Hawkins, ``because that pretty much means you're almost dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, deadness began to set in in January, when the NBA and
the players' union settled their preposterousness and agreed to
play the most invalid and esthetically absurd sports season since
the 1987 NFL scab games.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were destined to fare worse than most of their
high-end contemporaries merely by having to fill six roster spots
and the head coach position with new faces.
</P>
<P>
   But miss the playoffs? With Gary Payton, Vin Baker, Detlef
Schrempf and Hersey Hawkins? In a league in such poor shape that
the Teletubbies could average 75 points a game?
</P>
<P>
   No way.
</P>
<P>
   But where there's little will, apparently there is a way.
</P>
<P>
   By reporting grossly cherubic, Baker and free agent signee Billy
Owens not only committed professional fraud, they nearly took down
the Sonic season by themselves. Add coach Paul Westphal's multiple
dubious strategic maneuvers as well as president Wally Walker's
inability to stock quality veteran help thanks to the Jim McIlvaine
fiasco and reliance on rookie draftees, and the recipe for pro
basketball futility was writ large.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite all, the playoffs were still attainable until the
developments of this last desultory week.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the springtime bellyaching was confined mostly to
George Karl, who almost coached himself into another first-round
upset and then talked himself out of the job anyway.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it was the co-captains, Payton and Baker, whose
ill-considered oral geysers helped push the Sonics to the
precipice.
</P>
<P>
   After Payton bellowed his dismay in the locker room Wednesday,
it was Baker's turn Friday to hold the franchise momentarily
hostage. Pouting to Westphal and Walker, with Payton and agent in
tow, Baker had the audacity to complain about his playing time in
his first game back after bruising his knee.
</P>
<P>
   If the lockout didn't sufficiently sicken an NBA fan, and the
level of play didn't induce nausea, then the snits by Payton and
Baker are the kinds of moments under pressure that make easier the
abandonment of interest in pro sports.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that Sunday the Sonics finally had the tandem
contribution from Baker and Payton that they long had sought:
Payton had 29 points, five rebounds, five assists, and Baker off
the bench had 19 points, 12 rebounds and three blocks. Except for
Schrempf (21 points, 11 rebounds), it was the rest of the team that
failed in the clutch.
</P>
<P>
   All involved will deny that the week's tumult had anything to do
with Sunday's season-killing result. But that's the same kind of
denial engaged in a few weeks ago by the Lakers regarding the
distractions of Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers are clearly doing better without the headaches.
So would the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal takes almost a perverse pride in never revealing his
emotions to the media _ known in the hoops biz as a full reverse
George _ but Sunday's loss dragged him close to some public dismay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd prefer not to have the stuff out there,'' Westphal said,
referring to the Payton/Baker histrionics. ``Unfortunately it's a
big part of what this game is all about in the '90s. Whether it's
the increased visibility, or the WWF factor, I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I try to do is still enjoy the game. I don't enjoy the
losing, and I don't enjoy being the target of occasional unfair
criticism, but the game itself makes the circus worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunno about that, Paul. It must help greatly to be paid more
than $1 million to attend the circus, but this season's NBA game,
and this season's Sonics, who are better in a shouting match than a
shooting match (26th in field goal percentage, 27th in free throw
percentage), would severely test even the deepest of NBA loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   As Hawkins was saying, the only possibilities around the Sonics
these days are mathematical. Hope and joy were long ago eliminated.

GOODYKOONTZ-COLUMN (Undated) _ Dennis Grega owns what sound like
perfect dogs. Dartanian, part malamute and part shepherd, and
Alyosha, a Samoyed, don't climb on the furniture. Barking is not a
problem. Clean-up is non-existent, and the dogs never threaten the

NOTIFY - (TEMPE, Ariz.) The house near the middle of East Driftwood
Drive looked just like any other on the block, save for the
perfectly manicured pansies, petunias and geraniums that beckoned
the attention of passersby. But that was before police showed up in
this idyllic south Tempe neighborhood, papering it with bright pink
fliers, knocking on some 500 doors and inviting residents to a
community forum. The man who had cultivated such beautiful blooms
was a convicted sex offender. Things in the Lakes community
changed. At the grocery store, a mother grabbed her young son's arm
and pointed to ``the bad man.'' Women veered off the sidewalk into
the middle of the street when they reached the block where the man
lived. Families stopped letting their children play in the front
yard without supervision. Across the nation, more and more
neighborhoods are being alerted when a sex offender moves in. The
year-long experience of the Lakes shows how such news can pit
neighbor against neighbor, with some camped firmly against sex
offenders like Glenn, saying their pasts automatically make them a
danger, and others arguing that they should get another chance. By
JUDY VILLA. Story will move in the ``a'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
LIFETEEN - (LITTLETON, Colo.) At the Catholic parish, the teenagers
who lost 13 friends in the Columbine High School shootings danced,
clapped and sang ``The Happy Song'' on Sunday morning to a jammin'
band. They have spent practically every waking minute since Friday
night together at a retreat at St. Frances Cabrini Catholic Church,
only two miles from Columbine High School. This retreat was
supposed to be for the 91 members of the 1999 confirmation class.
After the shootings, the retreat was opened to any teen who wanted
to come. The retreat doubled in size. St. Frances' high school
group, Life Teen, is part of the national Life Teen program that
began in Mesa, and Life Teen leaders, including seven adults from
Mesa and Gilbert Ariz., flew in as reinforcements. By KELLY

 &QL; 
VICKERS (PHOENIX) The career of one of Arizona's most notorious
criminals is expected to end Wednesday when Robert Wayne Vickers is
set to be executed at the Arizona State Prison in Florence.
Vickers, who has kept prison officials busy for the past 20 years
with a series of murders, assaults, threats and escapes, is
expected to be executed at 3 p.m. for the 1982 murder of fellow
death row inmate Wilmar ``Buster'' Holsinger. By MARK SHAFFER.

LOSS TO LAKERS LEAVES SONICS ALL BUT OUSTED

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It was more coincidence than anything that Olden
Polynice wore black.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his postgame attire and mood Sunday epitomized the Sonics
following their devastating 91-84 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers at
KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   When players start tossing around phrases like ``almost dead''
and ``killed us,'' you have to believe their season has officially
reached its morbid point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slim just hopped on the train,'' said Polynice, talking about
the team's playoff chances. ``None is left.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Sonics have two regular-season games left to hold
off the passing of their season. Sunday's loss did not
mathematically eliminate them from the postseason. However, the
outlook is bleak when you consider:
</P>
<P>
   -- The Sonics have won two games in a row only twice in the past
28 games.
</P>
<P>
   -- The seventh-seeded Minnesota Timberwolves are two games ahead
of Seattle in the Western Conference playoff standings. Even if the
Sonics finished tied with Minnesota, the Timberwolves own the
tie-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   -- Eighth-place Sacramento also has a two-game lead on the
ninth-place Sonics. The Kings must lose their final two games
against Denver and Vancouver, and the Sonics must sweep Dallas and
the Los Angeles Clippers to have a chance. If the Sonics finish
tied with Sacramento, they would go into the postseason based on a
better conference record.
</P>
<P>
   In other words. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we have a minuscule chance of getting in (the
playoffs),'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal said. ``We have to hope for
all kinds of help from other people. ... We won't give up as long
as there is a ray of hope, and that's all there is right now. ''
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to blame the Lakers for the Sonics' dire
circumstances. A more fitting assessment perhaps would be that the
Sonics just shot themselves in the foot.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Seattle probably would miss.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics turned in a flat-line performance in the most vital
game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   They missed easy shots.
</P>
<P>
   They missed open shots.
</P>
<P>
   They missed. They missed. They missed, and ended up shooting 37
percent at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to win many games that way,'' said Hersey
Hawkins, one of the main culprits after a 1-for-8 performance.
``The effort was there. We played hard. We just couldn't make shots
for some reason. For the most part the ones I shot felt good, and I
think the other guys will say the same.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Gary Payton's 29 points on 11-for-24
shooting, the rest of the Sonics starters shot 6-for-26 (23
percent) from the field. Detlef Schrempf put together 21 points
with the help of 15-for-16 shooting at the free throw line.
</P>
<P>
   Vin Baker came off the bench for a second straight game and
scored 19 points in 38 minutes. He used his quickness to slither
his way to the basket, and when it was time to use muscle on the
low block, he had that, too. In his second game back from a deep
bone bruise in his right knee, Baker gave the Sonics the effective
inside play they desperately needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't come in and feel myself out,'' Baker said. ``I had
to play aggressive to stay in the game. ... There is no tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   But Baker was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' starting five outscored the Sonics' starters 76-59.
</P>
<P>
   Laker guard Kobe Bryant did the most damage. He hit eight
straight baskets in a decisive third quarter and ran amok on the
Sonics' defense to the tune of 19 third-quarter points. He missed
just one of 10 shots in the period, which ended with the Lakers
ahead 70-57.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics went into a tailspin after relinquishing a 44-40
halftime lead, making just 4 of 16 shots in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Despite getting to within 81-78 with 2:18 left in the game, the
Sonics were 8-for-20 in the fourth period.
</P>
<P>
   It did not help that they turned the ball over 17 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' Baker said. `` ... There's no doubt about it.
The playoffs are just out of our control.''
</P>
<P>
   Like they have been all season, the Sonics were reaching for
anything to work during the stretch of this game.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal resorted to a strategy of using a much-smaller Dale
Ellis on mammoth Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal. Ellis hacked
O'Neal every time he touched the ball.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal responded by making five of his 10 free throws in the
game's final three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never understand that one,'' Polynice said. ``We're doing
things we normally wouldn't do. ... They went to their strengths.
They went to their advantages. I guess we didn't think they were
going to see it was a mismatch.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, this is turning out to be a season of conflict for
the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   They are on the verge of missing the playoffs for the first time
since the 1989-90 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to prepare for Dallas and root like crazy for
anybody Minnesota and Sacramento plays,'' Westphal said. ``As long
as there is a chance, our guys will be motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   The chance, however, is now slight for a Sonics team that has
already begun to mull what could have been.

`ENTRAPMENT' SNARES BIGGEST APRIL OPENING EVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Entrapment'' ensnared the nation's moviegoers as
the action-adventure dominated at multiplexes with a record-setting
$21.3 million at 2,814 theaters during the Friday-Sunday weekend,
studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The 20th Century Fox release, starring Sean Connery as a master
thief and Catherine Zeta-Jones as his pursuer, took in one-third of
the total box office and performed above industry expectations
during a traditionally soft period for moviegoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrapment'' benefited from drawing a broad cross-section of
theater audiences.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Entrapment' scored big numbers with date crowds and also
with younger audiences drawn by the action theme,'' said Robert
Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source tracking service. ``The
combination of Sean Connery (for women) and Catherine Zeta-Jones
(for men) paid off big for Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrapment'' set a record for an April opening, topping the
$20.6 million set two weeks ago by ``Life.'' Bucksbaum predicted
``Entrapment'' will take in $70 million by the end of its run.
</P>
<P>
   Overall box office receipts hit $61 million, up 4 percent from
the same weekend last year when ``He Got Game'' led with only $7.6
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrapment'' will face strong competition next weekend from
Universal's ``The Mummy,'' the last major release before ``Star
Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace'' on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrapment'' matched the combined total of the next four
films, led by Warner Bros.' fifth weekend of ``The Matrix'' with
$8.7 million at 2,903 theaters to push its total to nearly $130
million.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum noted that the strong performances by ``Entrapment''
and ``The Matrix'' have disproved the theory that studios need to
open high-profile action-adventures in the summer or holiday period
to score blockbuster-type numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's third weekend of ``Life'' took third with 6.4
million at 2,615 theaters, followed by Fox's fourth weekend of
``Never Been Kissed'' with $4.1 million at 2,484 screens, and
Warner's ninth weekend of ``Analyze This'' with $2.2 million at
2,128 screens. ``Analyze This'' has topped $98 million after 59
days and will soon become the second 1999 film to reach the $100
million milestone.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's fifth weekend of ``10 Things I Hate About You'' came in
sixth with $1.8 million at 2,020 theaters, edging Sony's opening of
``Idle Hands'' a teen horror comedy with $1.78 million at 1,611
screens.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum noted the studio had scaled back its marketing
campaign for ``Idle Hands'' in the wake of the Colorado school
shooting tragedy, adding ``the film was doomed from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   Battling for eighth were two fast-fading disappointments in
their second weekend _ Fox's ``Pushing Tin'' with $1.29 million at
1,283 theaters and Warner's ``Lost &AMP; Found'' with $1.28 million at
2,469 screens.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 10 was Sony's fourth weekend of ``Go'' with
$1.2 million at 1,419 theaters, edging Paramount's fifth weekend of
``The Out-of-Towners'' with $1.1 million at 1,850 screens and
DreamWorks' seventh weekend of ``Forces of Nature'' with $967,000
at 1,700 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's limited release of ``Election'' continued to perform
well, with $242,000 at 14 theaters. The high school comedy, a
favorite with critics, goes nationwide on Friday.

NATO ATTACK DARKENS BELGRADE AND AREAS OF SERBIA 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for new updating 3rd graf)  By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Serbia _ All of Belgrade and parts of Serbia were
plunged into darkness just after 10 o'clock Sunday night, when NATO
warplanes hit a major hydro-electric power station west of the
capital, in Obrenovac, said a Serbian Cabinet minister, Goran
Matic.
</P>
<P>
   As anti-aircraft fire filled the skies over Belgrade, lights all
over the city suddenly went dark, leaving the eerie sight of cars
speeding across Belgrade bridges. The official Serbian radio later
reported that power had been restored in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity was restored to central Belgrade shortly before 5
a.m. on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The strike at the power station was hinted at in some of the
recent propaganda leaflets dropped by NATO planes.
</P>
<P>
   One leaflet, which may have been a warning of the strike Sunday
night, showed a picture of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
with an arrow pointing backward. Above the president's name it
said: ``No gasoline, no electricity, no trade, no freedom, no
future.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side it said: ``As long as Milosevic is going to
continue his program of destruction, rape and murder in Kosovo,
Serbia will go deeper into isolation. Don't be prisoners of
Milosevic's awfulness.''
</P>
<P>
   An earlier foreshadowing apparently came late last month from
Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman. Referring to several
protests staged by citizens of the capital and the Yugoslav
government since the NATO bombings began, he said, ``You can have
your rock concerts, but pretty soon it's going to be Belgrade
unplugged.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbs reacted immediately with anger. A woman who works for a
Western news agency said: ``This really makes me annoyed. This is
not a military target. This is just trying to demoralize ordinary
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the power station seemed a clear rejection of the
Rev. Jesse Jackson's request that the White House consider a halt
to bombing after Milosevic released three captive American soldiers
early Sunday. The attack on what appeared to be a civilian target
came less than 12 hours after Jackson and his party of religious
leaders flew with the three soldiers to freedom in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we make a gesture of good will, they respond with
escalation,'' said a senior Yugoslav official. ``Someone has
decided to keep using the stick, and why?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about politics, but pure power,'' he added. ``It's
just to show muscle, it doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO has vowed to intensify its air attacks against Yugoslavia,
vowing to force a change in Belgrade's policies toward Kosovo,
where tens of thousand of ethnic Albanian have been forced from
their homes. The heaviest NATO bombings since the air war began 40
days ago have occurred in the last few days. NATO planes have been
flying more than 600 sorties a day, last week hitting Milosevic's
official residence in an exclusive area of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of sorties has increased so has the number of
accidents. In the last week NATO has bombed residential areas of
Belgrade, Prizren and Surdulica _ all by mistake. NATO sent a
missile into Bulgaria, a prospective alliance member, where it
sliced the roof off a house.
</P>
<P>
   The intention clearly seems to be to try to force Milosevic to
yield by increasing the pain on ordinary citizens, with the
mounting discomforts ranging from a severe shortage of cigarettes _
which should not be underestimated in the Balkans _ to a monthly
ration of gasoline that is now only five gallons.
</P>
<P>
   Different parts of Belgrade have been blacked out by previous
raids, but never the entire city at once, and transportation has
been increasingly difficult, with much of the country's bridge and
rail network destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavs have proved resilient improvisers, however,
usually patching together repairs that allow basic services to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all NATO's effort to drive Serbian state television off
the air _ by striking at transmitting stations and offices _ it has
been able to keep broadcasting to most parts of the country. Now
NATO has apparently decided to cut power to the television sets
themselves.

CHARLES DAWSON, 88, LED IN STUDY OF POISON IVY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.H., N.Y., S.C., R.I., Idaho, Maine)  (mk) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Dawson, a longtime chemistry professor at Columbia
University who played the leading role in the discovery of the
toxic compounds in poison ivy, died on Wednesday in a hospital in
Wolfeboro, N.H. He was 88 and lived in Wolfeboro.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson taught at Columbia from 1939 until he retired in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, he and David Wasserman, a Columbia graduate student
then, began to carry out experiments involving poison ivy. They
collected 80 pounds of poison ivy bark, from which they extracted
two teaspoons of the poisonous oil. The oil was used in preliminary
chemical experiments, and then the scientists began work on
developing methods of synthesizing compounds similar to those found
in poison ivy oil.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, Dawson told reporters that he and Wasserman had
developed a synthetic compound resembling the chemical structure of
poison ivy and producing the same physiological effects. At that
time, the compound, which was considered better than poison ivy as
an aid in the diagnosis and possible treatment of the effects of
contact with the plant, was being tested by Dr. Harry Keil of the
Skin and Center Unit of the New York Post-Graduate Medical School
and Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, it was announced that Dawson and his research students
had isolated the toxic agent in the sap of poison ivy and had
broken it down into four distinct parts.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson's son, John, a chemistry professor at the University of
South Carolina, said Sunday that the least toxic of the four was
one of a family of chemical compounds, called alkyl catechols,
which cause allergic responses in most people.
</P>
<P>
   With researchers from the National Institutes of Health, Charles
Dawson set about trying to discover a treatment or vaccine based on
that least toxic compound.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, tests carried out at the University of Pennsylvania on
a vaccine developed by Dawson for the prevention of the adverse
effects of poison ivy were reported to have been successful.
Thousands of volunteers had submitted to a series of injections
intended to desensitize them to poison ivy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, it was reported that the poison ivy vaccine, which
could be taken orally or intramuscularly, would soon be on the
market. John Dawson said that it was his understanding that the
vaccine had been on the market for some years, and that eventually
it had been supplanted, as the chief anti-poison ivy treatment, by
steroid-based anti-inflammatory ointments.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Dawson was born in Peterboro, N.H. He received a
bachelor's degree in 1933 and a master's degree in chemistry in
1935, both from the University of New Hampshire, and a doctorate in
1938 from Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son, Dawson is survived by his wife,
Dorothea; a daughter, Patricia Dawson Runner of Tiverton, R.I.;
seven grandchildren; a sister, Ruth Taylor of Boise, Idaho, and a
brother, Robert, of Leeds, Maine.

WHILE OTHERS SAY GOODBYE, SEATTLE SAYS GOOD RIDDANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ With Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky, it was more of
a cerebral appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   John Elway is different. It's visceral. Personal.
</P>
<P>
   To veteran followers of Seattle sports, John Elway has been the
acme of sporting villainy.
</P>
<P>
   For the longest time, in the cruelest ways, Elway taunted the
Seahawks, then crushed them.
</P>
<P>
   To him, for the players and Seattle fans, let it be said now:
</P>
<P>
   Good freakin' riddance.
</P>
<P>
   That is meant in the nicest way. Which is another problem: Elway
is not only the ultimate gladiator, but a sportsman and gentleman.
</P>
<P>
   For the Seahawk fan, how does it get more aggravating?
</P>
<P>
   If Elway had a little more Snidely Whiplash in him, his
departure would be more cathartic in these precincts. But Elway
never seemed to enjoy taunting or trash talking. He seemed pleased
enough simply to reach into the Seahawk chest and fetch out the
beating heart.
</P>
<P>
   If he just had a DWI, or cursed a reporter, or packed heat, or
smoked dope ... the worst thing he ever did was fire Dan Reeves,
and every superstar fires a head coach at least once.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Seahawks who chased him across the Northwest have
nothing but respect and admiration for the guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's one thing that made him stand out, it's that he
kept getting the first down, some kind of way,'' said Dave Brown,
who flailed against him as a Seahawk defensive back as well as a
Seahawk assistant coach. ``It seemed like almost every time it was
third and long, he found a way to get the ball in the right hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember coaching a game in the Kingdome, I think it was
'93, when we had been doing a great defensive job on Denver. We had
'em stopped, it was third-and-15 around the Seattle 40 and we ran a
blitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Broncos sent everybody out and we were all over Elway. But
somehow he ducked under a lineman, went almost to his knees. Our
safety on (tight end) Shannon Sharpe, Robert Blackmon, thought
Elway was sacked and hesitated just a second. All of a sudden Elway
straightens up and throws this bullet to Sharpe. Hits him in the
numbers at the goal line before Blackmon knew what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best throw I ever saw a quarterback make.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how it's been for most of the 16 years Seattle has been
under Elway's hegemony. The Seahawks' 9-20 record in his starts
with the Broncos is the worst among Seattle's frequently played
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, with one possible exception, no other opponent in
Seattle's modern big-time pro sports history has tortured this town
so much. From 1983 to 1998, Elway was the grounds in our collective
latte.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 20 greatest individual passing games against the
Seahawks' in their 23 seasons, Elway has the most, five, including
his last one _ 335 yards in December, when the Broncos ended the
Seahawks' regular season and another Seahawk coach's NFL career.
</P>
<P>
   That was the Broncos' sixth straight win over the Seahawks and
11th in the last 13 games (one of the two Seattle wins, 31-27 in
1995, required staging the greatest comeback, from 20-0, in club
history).
</P>
<P>
   If Elway played one more season, the NFL would have to sell what
remained of the Seattle franchise to Bronco owner Pat Bowlen, who
already owned most of it.
</P>
<P>
   In the category of perennial Seattle nemesis, Elway has no peer
from baseball. Perhaps the best long-term batting career against
the Mariners was Cal Ripken Jr., whose .294 average (plus 28 homers
and 110 RBI) is his highest mark against any AL foe. He also went
7-for-16 in the 1997 AL Division Series to help eliminate the
Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   The best pitcher against Seattle probably was Dave Stewart, 20-6
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The one rival Elway has as Seattle nemesis was a longtime
unmatchable for the Sonics: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
</P>
<P>
   In his career from 1969-70 to 1988-89, the Sonics had a record
of 30-88 against his teams in Milwaukee (7-27) and Los Angeles
(23-51), a miserable 25.4 winning percentage. In the playoffs, the
Sonics fared little better, going 7-14 (33 percent) in five playoff
series against his Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Seahawks won 31 percent of their games against Elway's
Broncos, it might be argued that Abdul-Jabbar helped wreak more
devastation. But the Sonics were expansion fodder in Abdul-Jabbar's
dominant early years. And as a Laker, Abdul-Jabbar was almost
always surrounded by superlative talent.
</P>
<P>
   Elway, on the other hand, was a rookie when the Seahawks were at
their best, and later often was hampered by the ordinariness of his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the beginning, Elway haunted. The first playoff game
in Seahawk history was in 1983, a 31-7 win over the Broncos when
rookie Elway came in for injured Steve DeBerg and hit 10 passes in
15 attempts _ a percentage he reached in only one other of his 22
postseason games.
</P>
<P>
   By 1985, he threw for 432 yards against the Seahawks, the
second-highest Seahawk opponent total.
</P>
<P>
   About the only time the Seahawks had much of an edge on the
Elway-led Broncos was 1987-88, when haircut/linebacker Brian
Bosworth personalized the rivalry to wonderfully silly proportions.
With a large photo of Elway pasted to his locker, Bosworth publicly
taunted Elway, calling him ``Mr. Ed'' and helping the Seahawks beat
the Broncos in three of four meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But Bosworth turned out to be as temporary as the Seahawk sack
that Brown described. Long after Boz started getting paid to be a
bad actor instead of doing it free, Elway endured, enraged and, to
a more enlightened, less provincial point of view, enthralled.
</P>
<P>
   To Seattle eyes, he was the greatest, most aggravating, rival
ever. And we haven't even mentioned his brilliant Stanford career
against the Washington Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   To top it off, he's a native son, born in Port Angeles where his
dad, Jack, coached high school.
</P>
<P>
   Did we mention John's wife is from Tacoma?
</P>
<P>
   For his entire athletic life, he's been coming back to town,
beating up the local boys, getting the girl and stealing all the
horses and the whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   A weepy farewell? The only dry place in Seattle is sports fans'
eyes.

   LOS ANGELES _ For another day, Denis Nefedova was able to forget
the pain of his burns, as well as the pain of the operations to
repair his scarred skin, and to play Sunday in the temple of
American pop culture that is Universal Studios.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-year-old Russian boy got to meet his hero Spider-man,
play with a capuchin monkey and hug actors in the plush costumes of
dinosaurs from the animated film ``The Land Before Time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't wait until this day,'' said Denis, eager to leave
early for his 11 a.m. visit. ``I woke up at 7 o'clock and couldn't
go back to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Badly burned on his head and hands in an explosion at his home
last year, Denis came to the United States two months ago so he
could be treated at the Grossman Burn Center in Sherman Oaks.
Between his operations, his mother, who accompanied him, and some
newfound friends in the local Russian-American community have tried
to offer him happy distractions, such as visits to Disneyland, the
Long Beach Aquarium of the Pacific and Universal Studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to take him here so he would forget about
everything,'' said his new friend and translator, Jenny Chernetsky,
12, daughter of Mila Chernetsky, who works at the Grossman Burn
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Denis ran through the park with Jenny, skipping eagerly to the
next attraction, and danced to ``The Power of Love'' while waiting
to board the Back to the Future ride.
</P>
<P>
   He even volunteered to go on stage in front of 1,500 people at
the Animal Stars show during a skit with Beethoven the dog, and he
braved the threat of the St. Bernard's prodigious drool.
</P>
<P>
   Without a trace of self-consciousness, he spent the day immersed
in the thick Sunday crowd and the pleasures of the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back at home, people would look at him like some kind of I
don't know what,'' his mother said through a translator.
</P>
<P>
   ``With friends and at school, it was OK,'' she said. But adults
as well as children pointed and stared when he appeared among
strangers. ``I felt like crying. He said, `Just don't pay
attention. Don't worry.'''
</P>
<P>
   People in the United States have been more polite, she said.
Denis glided through the crowds Sunday, as did other children there
with families and friends.
</P>
<P>
   During a power outage, Denis lighted a candle at his family's
apartment on Sakhalin Island, north of Japan. The candle ignited
fumes from gasoline the family stored in the home, and his head and
hands were engulfed in a fireball.
</P>
<P>
   He was treated by doctors in his hometown and in Moscow, but
their expertise and facilities were insufficient to prevent severe
scarring. A doctor from North Hollywood contacted colleagues at the
Grossman Burn Center, and Denis and his mother arrived in March for
the boy to begin treatments to repair his face and restore
dexterity to his hands.
</P>
<P>
   He faces a year of operations and treatments _ the next at the
end of the month, when surgeons will cut scar tissue from his left
cheek and graft more elastic skin from his leg.
</P>
<P>
   Because of what happened to him, Denis said he was anxious about
some of the rides at Universal, where nearly every attraction
includes fire or explosions.
</P>
<P>
   During the Waterworld show, he applauded and laughed during some
of the near-slapstick violence. In his beginner's English, he
called out ``good shot, good shot,'' when the good guys took out
the bad guys. He even watched in wide-eyed excitement during the
pyrotechnics while he was in the safety of his mother's embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``He liked it, but it was scary for him in the fire, so he
closed his eyes,'' his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted he wasn't really scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he told her. ``Everything's fine. It's not real. It's
like the movies.''

PATAKI TESTS NATIONAL WATERS, BUT BARELY A RIPPLE IS SEEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York Gov. George Pataki had just finished a 50-minute speech
at Georgetown University about the Balkans when a student
interposed a question that had little to do with Pataki's views on
foreign policy: Why was a New York governor offering a major
address in Washington on global problems in the first place?
``Normally, those are handled by presidents and vice presidents,''
Matthew Payne, a government major, observed dryly.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki paused as a rustle of laughter rose from the seats. ``I'm
sure that we have many New Yorkers involved in the airstrikes,'' he
said. Besides, the governor asserted, ``The national policy debate
_ the decisions that are made here in Washington _ have an enormous
effect on New York.''
</P>
<P>
   As the question posed at Georgetown last week suggests, Pataki's
campaign to establish himself as a leading influence within his
party _ shaping the Republican Party's platform and earning
consideration as a top-tier candidate for national office _
apparently has yet to take hold. Three months after Pataki began
offering his views of the world beyond Albany, his state capital,
with a series of speeches across the country, Republican
politicians and strategists say he remains largely a New York state
figure, respected for his accomplishments in that state, but still
not considered among the leading forces in his party.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's signature argument that his party should turn away from
such issues as abortion rights and embrace the Reagan-era platform
of cutting government spending and taxes has yet to inspire the
kind of debate that the governor might have envisioned. Even
Republicans who praise his record say he is rarely mentioned in
discussions these days about potential presidential or vice
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that he is not a serious candidate,'' said Mike
Murphy, a Republican strategist who worked for Bob Dole's
presidential campaign in 1996. ``His presidential ambitions are
writing checks that his political muscle can't cash. There is no
opening for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Bailey, a former Republican consultant who is now the
publisher of a daily political digest and tip sheet, said: ``I
don't think he's on anybody's list. I don't think anybody seriously
thinks that he's planning to run. I don't think he's a household
name anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding his apparent lack of success to date, Pataki has
a history of emerging unexpectedly at the top of the political
heap. He was, after all, the little-known Republican legislator
from Westchester who toppled former Gov. Mario Cuomo, and he is
nothing if not a persistent candidate.
</P>
<P>
   His nomination in 1994 came after years of steady if unnoticed
work in New York political circles, traveling the state and giving
speeches, preparing himself should the political opportunity arise,
as it did when Republican leaders recruited him to run against
Cuomo. He is now executing the same kind of strategy on a national
level, his aides say.
</P>
<P>
   And Pataki said that he was satisfied with his success so far,
asserting in an interview that his speeches on national politics
and the future of the Republican Party _ in Illinois, Missouri and
New Hampshire, among other places _have drawn attention both to his
record in Albany and to his views on how his party can become more
competitive in national elections. ``I really believe this stuff,''
he said. ``I really believe in these principles.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I am amazed at the level of attention,'' Pataki said. ``When
you have seven or eight candidates _ and I'm not a candidate _ to
have obtained the level of attention that we've gotten is, to me,
very surprising. I didn't expect it to be as widespread.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a view, though, that is not widely shared among
Republicans these days. Several contrasted Pataki's trips with
those of his predecessor: In particular, Cuomo's 1984 speech about
abortion rights at the University of Notre Dame, when he was a
first-term governor, which drew extensive national attention and
helped stir the talk among some Democrats about Cuomo as a
potential presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's advisers describe what he is doing as, in effect, a
should-lightning-strike strategy: establishing his credentials in
case one of the Republicans more commonly mentioned for national
office should falter. But that is an eventuality that even Pataki's
advisers see as increasingly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's attempt to use the 2000 presidential campaign to
raise his own profile _ following a long line of governors from New
York who have done the same thing to great success, whether Thomas
Dewey or Cuomo _ has been, to some extent, undercut by events
beyond his control.
</P>
<P>
   When Pataki began earlier this year, it was far from clear who
the Republican Party might nominate for president. That has changed
with the rise of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas as the party's
leading presidential contender, to Pataki's clear disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's actually looked at as a candidate by very
many people because the movement to Bush is unabated,'' said Gov.
John Engler of Michigan, an early supporter of Bush. ``There is a
settling in that's taking place that in all likelihood, George W.
Bush is going to be our nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   And Pataki's hopes of being considered for vice president are
complicated by, among other things, his support of abortion rights,
which will certainly be a contrary position at the next Republican
convention, and the fact that he is from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing Republicans are concerned about is reinforcing
their base in the South and the Southwest,'' said Adam Goodman, a
Republican consultant. ``The Northeast is not at the top of the
priority list.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pataki has succeeded in distinguishing himself
ideologically in his party, with his emphasis on economic issues
combined with his support for abortion rights and gay rights.
Several advisers said that such ideological positioning could prove
fortuitous in future presidential elections if the Republican Party
moves to the center. In that event, what Pataki is doing now could
pay dividends in 2004 or 2008, much the same way his work in New
York in 1990 paid off in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Pataki said he intends to continue traveling
the nation, presenting himself as a noncandidate concerned about
the future of the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is doing what you can do when you are the governor of New
York, which is to monkey around in the primary season,'' Murphy,
the Republican consultant, said. ``There is no such thing as too
much exposure.''

<P>
   PHOENIX _ The career of one of Arizona's most notorious
criminals is expected to end Wednesday when Robert Wayne Vickers is
set to be executed at the Arizona State Prison in Florence.
</P>
<P>
   Vickers, who has kept prison officials busy for the past 20
years with a series of murders, assaults, threats and escapes, is
expected to be executed at 3 p.m. for the 1982 murder of fellow
death row inmate Wilmar ``Buster'' Holsinger.
</P>
<P>
   Vickers also was sentenced to death for the murder of his
cellmate, Frank Ponciano, in 1979. He carved the word ``Bonzai,'' a
misspelling of the Japanese war cry, in Ponciano's back.
</P>
<P>
   He came to be known thereafter as ``Bonzai Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is far from the first time that Vickers has come close
to death. He escaped execution after death warrants were signed on
five earlier occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Department of Corrections officials say they are taking
unprecedented security steps for the execution, some of which they
won't talk about.
</P>
<P>
   Camilla Strongin, a Corrections spokeswoman, said Vickers is
being shuttled between two cells that are equipped with heavy
plastic glass and with reinforced welds connecting the beds to the
walls. Vickers has made weapons in the past by breaking welds on
beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he leaves one cell for the other, it is searched
extensively before he returns to it,'' Strongin said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ben Cooper, a Phoenix attorney who represents Vickers, said
he feels he has fertile psychological grounds to win a stay of
execution.
</P>
<P>
   After a long juvenile history of petty crime, he said, Vickers
was originally sentenced to three to nine years for grand theft in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections records, Cooper said, show a pattern of inadequate
mental health care and ``reflect the history of an inmate who came
to prison on a robbery charge and psychologically deteriorated
until he ended up on death row.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident with Holsinger is a major point in Vickers' appeal
seeking a stay of execution, Cooper said, because the attack was
not premeditated.
</P>
<P>
   Vickers attacked Holsinger with a firebomb he fashioned in his
jail cell after Holsinger had made lewd comments about Vickers'
11-year-old niece. Vickers was the porter in death row at the time
and had shown Holsinger a picture of the girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a guy (Vickers) with a flash point about sexual
molestation of children,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's kind of a noble impulse. I fear that the state and
DOC just want to see him dead because he hasn't been a choirboy in
prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he was sent to prison, Vickers has been cited for more
than 160 major disciplinary violations, including more than 35
counts of making weapons, more than a dozen assaults and numerous
threats. &QL;

DOG GONE, BUT NOT TO YARD IN SKY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dennis Grega owns what sound like perfect dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Dartanian, part malamute and part shepherd, and Alyosha, a
Samoyed, don't climb on the furniture. Barking is not a problem.
Cleanup is non-existent, and the dogs never threaten the postman.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, they're dead.
</P>
<P>
   Which cuts down on their usefulness as guard dogs considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Grega had both dogs preserved; they lie, seemingly asleep, in a
bedroom of his New York apartment. Forever.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else, Fido, too, must shuffle off this canine
coil. But even the most devoted pet lover might wonder: What's the
point of keeping him around after he's gone?
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last few years, it has alleviated the pain of losing
those animals,'' explained Grega, who works at a software company.
``I see them every day. . . . It's not like they're in the ground
decomposing. I can touch them. My kid actually likes to pet them.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry. Four-year-old Dion doesn't think all dogs lie stone
still.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets along well with live dogs,'' Grega said, laughing.
``He'll even tell me we have two dogs, and they're both dead.'' &QL; 
`After-death pet care'
</P>
<P>
   Grega had his dogs preserved in Phoenix at Pet &AMP; Animal Lovers
Service, or PALS. The company specializes in after-death pet care.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are getting more emotionally attached to pets,'' said
Katherine Heuerman, PALS founder. ``Everyone's going to (the option
of) getting their pets back.''
</P>
<P>
   Often in the form of ashes: Cremations make up the bulk of her
business, Heuerman said. PALS cremates 60 to 65 animals a week (the
crematoriums are open for pet owners to inspect).
</P>
<P>
   But preservation is growing; one or two people a month now
request it.
</P>
<P>
   Preservation is a form of taxidermy, Heuerman explained, only
more detailed. You didn't gurgle baby talk for 10 years to the
white-tailed buck mounted above the mantel, after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fox or deer is wildlife,'' Heuerman said. ``People see them
once, they shoot them, they kill them. There is no emotional
attachment. We have to capture the personality.''
</P>
<P>
   So PALS requires at least three photos of the pet. Preservation
is not cheap; it starts at about $500. (Cremations start at $100,
and burials run $750 to $1,000, Heuerman said.) It's also slow,
taking six to 12 months. But to some, it's worth it. &QL; 
Peanut's place
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said to Peanut, `You'll never leave me,' '' said
Sandra Wade of Scottsdale. And so he hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Peanut, a chocolate-brown poodle no longer among the living,
lies atop a red satin pillow in a cherry-wood bed on top of the
entertainment center in Wade's bedroom. He's encased in a
custom-made glass case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to keep him with me,'' Wade said. ``I didn't want to
cremate him, and I didn't want him rotting in the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Peanut soon will be joined by Buddy, a white bichon frise, who
died in March and is being preserved, and, eventually, by her seven
other dogs. ``It's well worth the investment,'' Wade said.
``(Preserving Peanut) helped me. I cried when I saw him, but it was
happy. I feel very comfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't. A dead pet sitting on a shelf staring back at me
sounds creepy.
</P>
<P>
   Grega understands that, noting that if he didn't know and love
Dartanian and Alyosha, he might find their presence weird, too. But
he did, so he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like they're asleep,'' he said. ``They're where
they've always been. They slept in these poses when they were
alive. If you imagine hard enough, you can imagine them sleeping
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He even talks to them, saying things like ``I miss you guys''
and ``I wish you were alive'' and ``I'm glad you're here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of unusual things going on in this world,''
Grega said. ``While that probably is unusual, there are a lot of
things going on you could look at a lot more cross-eyed than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough. I'm willing to let eternally sleeping dogs lie.
Someone else's dogs, that is. In someone else's house. &QL;

COLORADO TEEN RETREAT TURNS TO HEALING 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ The teenagers who lost 13 friends in the
Columbine High School murders danced and sang ``The'' ``Happy
Song'' on Sunday morning at St. Frances Cabrini Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   As the band jammed, the 75 or so teens sang out: ``Everybody's
singing now, 1-2-3, `cause we're so happy . . . And unseen angels
celebrate, for joy is in this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Joy, for the first time since April 20, had replaced sadness,
fear, anger and myriad other emotions for many of the teenagers who
took part in the retreat that began Friday night at the church,
which is only two miles from Columbine High.
</P>
<P>
   The retreat was supposed to be for the 91 members of the 1999
confirmation class. Daniel Mauser, who died at Columbine, was
supposed to be there.
</P>
<P>
   After the shootings, the church opened the retreat to any teen
who wanted to come _ nearly 200 took part _ and changed the theme
to ``We survived. We will prevail. We have hope to carry on.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Frances' high school group, Life Teen, is part of the
national Life Teen program that began in Mesa. Seven adults from
the East Valley flew to Littleton to help with the retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the St. Frances teens know the victims, but several
_ Mauser, Lauren Townsend, Rachel Scott and Matthew Ketcher and two
others who were wounded _ were in their Life Teen group. Nearly
everyone at the retreat knew someone who died and some knew them
all.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday morning, the teenagers cheered and hugged and
laughed and began to heal, they said. The funerals are over and
they have been reminded of the presence of Jesus in their lives and
in the lives of their friends who died, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brain has just been a mess,'' said 16-year-old Caitlin
Whitney. She was in the courtyard when the shooting began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been able to focus enough to pray more than `God,
please help me, please help me get through this,' '' she said.
``Just being here this weekend, I was able to focus and able to
make a connection. I actually felt like I was talking to God, and
he was hearing me. It made me feel satisfied, like I'm OK. I will
be fine now.''
</P>
<P>
   The teenagers have a lot to be happy about, said Jessica Mestas,
15. The community is closer, more people are seeking God, and fewer
people died than the killers intended, the teens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was the devil's great plan, it's all back in his
face,'' Mestas said. ``I think a lot of good has come out.''
</P>
<P>
   When the retreat opened Friday, the teens, who came from several
area high schools, ran the gamut of emotions. Some were sick of
hearing about Columbine. Others hadn't come to terms with their
feelings. All needed a breath of fresh air. The weekend was a mix
of fun _ pickup basketball games in the gym, rowdy music and
humorous skits _ and serious talks and prayer.
</P>
<P>
   There was time to spend with one or two friends tucked away in a
quiet stairwell, talking and consoling each other and time to
giggle and eat cookies. Counselors were on hand for private and
group sessions, and the confirmation class continued its work,
preparing for Tuesday when its members will be confirmed into the
faith.
</P>
<P>
   The speakers reminded the teens that God was there in the midst
of the evil. Law enforcement officials have said they don't
understand why 200 or 300 didn't die, said Steve Angrisano, a
national Catholic speaker and a member of St. Frances.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were flown by angels out of that school. Don't miss that.
Make your life count,'' Angrisano said.
</P>
<P>
   They were reminded of the martyrs of the faith, including Cassie
Bernall, the 17-year-old who was shot and killed after saying yes
when asked, ``Do you believe in God?''
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Schnurr, who worships at St. Frances, was in the library
when the shooting began. She was hit and began to pray. She also
was asked by one of the shooters if she believed in God, and she
said yes. It appeared she was going to be shot again, but something
distracted the shooter and she survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a miracle,'' said Bobby Ratzi, 16, who was in
the same confirmation group as Mauser. ``People say God never does
miracles. That was a smack in the face. You can't miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Three walls in the St. Frances Life Teen room are covered with
posters and cards of condolence from Life Teen members around the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The posters have hearts and angels drawn on them. Many quote the
Bible: ``We believe that Jesus died and rose again and so we
believe that God will take back with Jesus those who have died
believing in him.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what the St. Frances teenagers believe, they said, and
that is their hope and their joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have friends who don't believe in God. For them, it's over.
They'll never see their friends again. I don't know what I'd do if
I wouldn't be able to see my friends again,'' Whitney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to have patience,'' added Sarah Arzola, 17, who
was good friends with victim Rachel Scott. ``When I do die, I'm
going to see Rachel again. We all say we are lucky to be here. In a
way, they are even luckier to go to heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Catholics believe the real presence of Christ is in the bread of
the Eucharist, called the blessed sacrament. On Saturday night, the
lights were dimmed and Father Fred Gaglia brought out the blessed
sacrament, encased in glass, and the teens and adults fell to their
knees for adoration and prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Music played softly as Gaglia touched the sacrament to the
forehead of each teen, asking for God's blessing on them. He asked
that each one be filled with whatever gift of the spirit was
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Some cried. Some appeared to faint. Others had their tears
turned to laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a way that God could show them visibly his great love
and concern for them. Now it is a living reality for them,'' said
Gaglia, the western regional Life Teen coordinator who is based in
Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Kuenstler, 15, had left the class of Dave Sanders, the
teacher who was killed, just before the shooting started. She heard
shots in the hall and has had a difficult time since, she said. The
weekend, and especially Saturday night, were a help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a relief for me because of all the stuff we've been
going through,'' she said. ``I could just feel the holy spirit in
me. It was really cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Bell, 15, couldn't stop laughing Saturday night. She felt
happy, she said. Bell had buried her face in her hands and cried
after they had prayed for Mauser the night before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was God's way to tell me to stop mourning and to go on from
here,'' she said. ``The whole weekend calmed everyone down and made
everyone feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Beckman, the Life Teen director at the church, challenged
the teenagers to forgive the killers, Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold, and be examples to the community in finding forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do walk away from this and don't embrace forgiveness
and God's mercy, you become Eric and Dylan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``God has chosen us for a mission and he is going to give us
every tool and every weapon we need to bring glory and honor to him
through this. Go rock your world!'' Beckman said on Sunday at the
end of the retreat. The teenagers cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Then, T-shirts were handed out. On the front were the words
``Survive, prevail, hope'' and ``70X7.'' On the back, ``We
survived. We will prevail. We have hope to carry on!'' and the
symbol of a cross.
</P>
<P>
   In the gospel of Matthew, a man asks Jesus how many times he
should forgive his brother. Seven times? Jesus says, ``Seventy
times seven.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As Christians, we are called to forgive always. That's got to
be a rallying point for us,'' Beckman said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the teenagers pulled the T-shirts over their shirts
immediately. The rallying had begun. &QL;

GOODYKOONTZ-COLUMN (Undated) _ Dennis Grega owns what sound like
perfect dogs. Dartanian, part malamute and part shepherd, and
Alyosha, a Samoyed, don't climb on the furniture. Barking is not a

NOTIFY - (TEMPE, Ariz.) The house near the middle of East Driftwood
Drive looked just like any other on the block, save for the
perfectly manicured pansies, petunias and geraniums that beckoned
the attention of passersby. But that was before police showed up in
this idyllic south Tempe neighborhood, papering it with bright pink
fliers, knocking on some 500 doors and inviting residents to a
community forum. The man who had cultivated such beautiful blooms
was a convicted sex offender. Things in the Lakes community
changed. At the grocery store, a mother grabbed her young son's arm
and pointed to ``the bad man.'' Women veered off the sidewalk into
the middle of the street when they reached the block where the man
lived. Families stopped letting their children play in the front
yard without supervision. Across the nation, more and more
neighborhoods are being alerted when a sex offender moves in. The
year-long experience of the Lakes shows how such news can pit
neighbor against neighbor, with some camped firmly against sex
offenders like Glenn, saying their pasts automatically make them a
danger, and others arguing that they should get another chance. By

LIFETEEN - (LITTLETON, Colo.) At the Catholic parish, the teenagers
who lost 13 friends in the Columbine High School shootings danced,
clapped and sang ``The Happy Song'' on Sunday morning to a jammin'
band. They have spent practically every waking minute since Friday
night together at a retreat at St. Frances Cabrini Catholic Church,
only two miles from Columbine High School. This retreat was
supposed to be for the 91 members of the 1999 confirmation class.
After the shootings, the retreat was opened to any teen who wanted
to come. The retreat doubled in size. St. Frances' high school
group, Life Teen, is part of the national Life Teen program that
began in Mesa, and Life Teen leaders, including seven adults from
Mesa and Gilbert Ariz., flew in as reinforcements. By KELLY

VICKERS (PHOENIX) The career of one of Arizona's most notorious
criminals is expected to end Wednesday when Robert Wayne Vickers is
set to be executed at the Arizona State Prison in Florence.
Vickers, who has kept prison officials busy for the past 20 years

expected to be executed at 3 p.m. for the 1982 murder of fellow
death row inmate Wilmar ``Buster'' Holsinger. By MARK SHAFFER.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
MIAMI _ Not so long ago, Shane Reynolds couldn't win at Pro Player
Stadium.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now, he can't seem to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds became the first starter in the National League with
five wins Sunday as the Astros extended their winning streak to a
season-high four games with a 3-2 victory over the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros won for the sixth time in seven games and completed
their first-ever road sweep of the Marlins. Carl Everett and Tony
Eusebio paced the Astros' 13-hit attack with three hits apiece,
with Everett driving in two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, who entered with only one career victory in Miami,
held the Marlins to two runs and eight hits in 7 innings. He struck
out six and walked none.
</P>
<P>
   ``Masterful. He really is,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said.
``He's the kind of guy that is a perfectionist in everything he
does. If you watch him in his day-to-day routine his truck is
always washed, and his clothes are always tailored. Everything _ he
does it to a T.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros built a 3-0 lead, then held on after the Marlins
rallied with a two-run eighth. The Astros didn't help themselves,
stranding 12 runners to match a season high. They left 30 on base
during the three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one scared the heck out of me,'' said Dierker, whose team
was 10-20 against the Marlins on the road before the weekend.
``About the sixth inning, all those hits, walks and baserunners,
and nobody was coming home. Usually when we're on the other side of
that, I think we're going to win when the other team keeps missing
too many chances. If you blow that many opportunities to extend the
score, it usually comes back to haunt you.''
</P>
<P>
   But not when your No. 1 pitcher takes a shutout into the eighth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds (5-1) has won his last two starts at Pro Player
Stadium, which had been his personal ballpark of horror. He entered
Sunday's series finale 1-5 with a 9.10 ERA in seven games here.
During a game in 1997 in Miami, Reynolds hurt his right knee after
sitting through a rain delay and was forced to spend time on the
disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know (what it is about pitching here),'' said
Reynolds, who tied New York Mets reliever Dennis Cook for the
league lead in wins. ``It's one of those things somebody starts and
gets in your head. The credit goes to our offense and defense. They
picked me up with some good plays. If you keep the game close, we
can put up some runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds was cruising, up by three with two out in the eighth
inning before allowing a single to Alex Gonzalez and a double to
Mark Kotsay that dropped inside the left-field foul line. Jay
Powell replaced Reynolds and surrendered a two-run double to Cliff
Floyd that bounced over the center-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Floyd) hit it in the only place for us it didn't go out of
the park (for a home run),'' Reynolds said, referring to the
434-foot distance to the center-field wall, one of the deepest in
the majors. ``Anywhere else, and maybe it's a tie ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   The two runs marked the first given up by Reynolds since April
21, a span of 19 innings. Powell redeemed himself by striking out
Derrek Lee to end the inning, Lee's NL-leading 31st of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really want to give Floyd anything to hit, because he
can hurt you,'' Powell said. ``My slider is something I don't
really have a lot of command of right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Wagner notched his ninth save by retiring the side in
order in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   How bad are things for the Marlins? They own the worst record in
the majors (6-19) and have scored the fewest runs (86). And if that
isn't enough, Sunday's starting pitcher, Alex Fernandez, left after
only seven batters with a pulled right groin.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez (1-2), making his third start since returning from the
disabled list, had to leave in the second inning. He winced in pain
when he came off the mound awkwardly after throwing a 2-1 pitch to
Eusebio. After missing all of last season following rotator-cuff
surgery, the righthander was once again placed on the DL after the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scored one run off Fernandez in the first inning.
Craig Biggio and Bill Spiers led off with consecutive singles, and
Jeff Bagwell drove home Biggio with a sacrifice fly to center.
</P>
<P>
   Everett, who entered the game in a 2-for-20 slump, had hits in
his first three at-bats, which included a pair of RBI doubles. He
doubled off reliever Brian Edmondson in the third and added another
double in the fifth to make the score 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to come in here, (against) a young team like this
and a little inexperienced, and go in and try to take all three
games,'' said Everett. ``You don't want to lose to this type of
club.''
</P>
<P>
   Though their pitchers pretty much did their job, the Marlins
just couldn't come up with the big hit they needed. Of their 33
hits in the three-game series, 29 were singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take (winning) three games anywhere,'' Biggio said. ``It
was a tough game. That's a tough field during the daytime. Both
teams played well, and it came down to the last batter. We were
fortunate to get a couple of runs early and hold on.''

FEARFUL EYE: KEEPING WATCH ON SEX OFFENDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDI VILLA  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ The house near the middle of East Driftwood Drive
looked just like any other on the block, save for the perfectly
manicured pansies, petunias and geraniums that beckoned the
attention of passersby.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before police showed up in this idyllic south Tempe
neighborhood, papering it with bright pink fliers, knocking on some
500 doors and inviting residents to a community forum. (Tempe is
near Phoenix).
</P>
<P>
   The man who had cultivated such beautiful blooms was a convicted
sex offender. Things in the Lakes community changed.
</P>
<P>
   At the grocery store, a mother grabbed her young son's arm and
pointed to ``the bad man.'' Women veered off the sidewalk into the
middle of the street when they reached the block where the man
lived. Families stopped letting their children play in the front
yard without supervision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's a natural reaction,'' said Roger Glenn, 57, the
man who had altered the dynamics of the neighborhood. ``But if they
talked to me, they'd get a different opinion. I'm not a danger.
Just give me a chance and I'll prove it. I don't need to go back.
I'm too old for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, more and more neighborhoods are being alerted
when a sex offender moves in. The year-long experience of the Lakes
shows how such news can pit neighbor against neighbor, with some
camped firmly against sex offenders like Glenn, saying their pasts
automatically make them a danger, and others arguing that they
should get another chance.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, both sides find themselves forced to to confront
their fears, their prejudices and their notions of forgiveness. And
both sides ultimately change the way they live.
</P>
<P>
   Front gates in the Lakes were locked more than they weren't.
Doors got second deadbolts. Annette Capuchino got up three or four
times a night to check her house and make sure it was secure. She
bought a gun and obtained a concealed weapons permit. Pat Akey no
longer went outside after dark, yet she refused to buy
pepper-spray.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind notification is to create safer neighborhoods by
arming potential victims with the knowledge they need to protect
themselves. But is notification merely creating unnecessary
hysteria and hampering offenders from becoming productive members
of society?
</P>
<P>
   Fear is pervasive in newly notified neighborhoods, from the
mother who stands on the porch and watches her children walk two
doors down, to the dads who dust off their bikes to accompany
tikes, to the lady down the street who starts shooing kids toward
home when the sun goes down.
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, Capuchino could be watching a movie when ``all of a
sudden I get this fear he's right there.'' She drove her daughter,
Alicia, to school each morning, even though it was a five-minute
walk, and Alicia had to call and check in the minute she got home
in the afternoon. She wasn't allowed to walk up to the store or to
ride her new 10-speed bike alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm getting a phobia,'' Capuchino said. ``But I need to
do everything I can to feel safe and I don't. I don't like living
next to this man.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't slip up. You can't be comfortable. Not with the
person this close. I'm mad and I'm scared. I had to change my life
a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Capuchino saved $2,200 over three years to be able to move to
the Lakes with 15-year-old Alicia. She had been living in south
Phoenix but figured the Lakes, with its prestige and its better
schools and nicer houses would make her feel safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wrong,'' Capuchino said simply.
</P>
<P>
   She is moving when her lease expires at the end of the month.
(May) Capuchino said it's wrong that area residents had to change
their lifestyles around one man, and it's not fair that they had to
live always ``on our guard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I ever saw him, I'd probably spit on him,'' Capuchino said.
``Maybe he is a nice man, but I wouldn't want to know him like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   She is looking for a home in north Phoenix. Her first question
to any leasing agent, she says, will be ``Do you know of any
registered sex offenders in the area?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a question that homeowners have to answer honestly, and one
where a ``Yes'' likely means their property values will be
significantly affected.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakes is generally a friendly area, with tree-lined streets,
well-traveled bike lanes and man-made lakes. It's a mix of retirees
and families, but the people moving in seem to be getting younger.
The homes and townhouses are well-kept, and some people dock boats
to their back patios. Rover Elementary School, Fees Junior High
School and Marcos de Niza High School are minutes away on foot.
There are two day care centers within a mile or so and parks, one
at the end of Glenn's street.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing anyone expected was to hear that a sex offender
had moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Most found out about Glenn when they arrived home on a cold
December day to the pink flier stuck in their doors. ``SEX OFFENDER
NOTIFICATION,'' it said in bold black letters.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn served 10 years in prison after he pleaded guilty in 1987
to attempted sexual assault and attempted kidnapping. The victim
was a 33-year-old woman who met Glenn when she was looking for a
job at his bar.
</P>
<P>
   The woman told police that Glenn became violent when she shunned
his sexual advances after a night of drinking and that he pulled
off her sweater and punched her in the mouth, fracturing her jaw.
Glenn insists that the woman persisted in calling him even after he
filled the bartending position and that she took off her own shirt
and injured her jaw when she fell and hit her head on a table while
dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn hasn't had a drink since then and he maintains that the
woman leveled the charges in the hopes of getting a financial
settlement. He says that he pleaded guilty because he thought he
would get probation. He was 44 years old and didn't have any
history of sex crimes. His past convictions were mainly for
white-collar crimes stemming from his ownership in Detroit of a
mortgage and real estate company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you think,'' Glenn said of his past, ``but I know
myself. I'm not really a bad person. . . I'm going forward. I'm not
going backwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to dwell on the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn would have moved quietly into the Lakes last May, but he
made a mistake in registering after he was released from prison two
years ago: He listed his address as a P.O. Box. Police tracked him
down in August and arrested him for failing to register as a sex
offender. He is now on three years' probation for that.
</P>
<P>
   The community notification was done at the Lakes in early
December. Glenn, residents were told, was ranked Level 3, meaning
he was in the group considered most likely to reoffend.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Educational materials, including information about community
notification, registration requirements, sex offender facts and
personal safety rules for children, were provided to Lakes
residents at a forum held three days after the notification.
Residents also were reminded that it's against the law to threaten
or harass a sex offender.
</P>
<P>
   That warning may have spared Glenn the harassment that has
occasionally popped up across the country: vandalism, picketing,
beatings and verbal assaults. A single incident of a house burning
has been documented. And an Oregon offender had a gun pointed at
him.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In September 1996, someone burned a Scottsdale man's bushes
after his conviction for statutory rape and child rape was revealed
in anonymous fliers. The man slipped away from the neighborhood, in
the dark, four days later. His neighbors said they were proud of
what they'd done, hugged each other and watched their children
cheering that ``the bad man's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; More commonly, neighbors rally against sex offenders, making it
so uncomfortable for them that they either move away or decide not
to move in at all. Some offenders find themselves evicted or
repeatedly turned down for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``It used to be a societal value that you pay your debt to
society then go about trying to rebuild your life,'' said Eleanor
Eisenberg, executive director of the Arizona Civil Liberties Union.
``. . . I really don't understand the mentality that is more
interested in vengeance and punishment than in trying to remedy the
problem. We're not letting them move on and get back.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's just not realistic to expect society to give sex
offenders warm welcomes, equal privacy rights and immediate
acceptance, says David Beatty, the director of public policy for
the National Center for Victims of Crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because they have paid their debt to society doesn't mean
they have earned the trust of society. That is not instantaneous
just because they walked out of the prison gates,'' Beatty says.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Glenn tried to fit in. He kept his home immaculate
and planted fresh flowers as soon as the old ones wilted. He and
his girlfriend kept to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy doing what I'm doing now,'' Glenn said. ``I'm very
comfortable where I'm at. I like my freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn didn't see his neighbors much. He got up every morning in
the dark and strolled through the neighborhood streets. With two
Diet Pepsis and two bananas, he reported to work at a Tempe travel
agency at 9 a.m. He took a two-hour lunch and worked, setting
appointments over the phone, until 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a responsible person, in my eyes, in our society,'' said
Bill Fautsch, Glenn's boss. ``He pays his taxes. He just bought a
new car. He jogs. He's physically fit. This is not the animal they
typecast him as.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; But a few neighbors initially wanted to circulate a petition
forcing Glenn to move. In the end, they changed their own lives
instead and learned to co-exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the idea of forgiving is there,'' said Akey, the block
watch captain on Glenn's block. ``. . . If he's on the level now,
if this is what should be, then maybe we should let it be.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, forgiving is not an easy thing in neighborhoods where sex
offenders have moved in. Many find themselves unable to look past
the crime, especially if it involves children. And while some say
they are willing to dole out second chances to thieves or drug
addicts, sex offenders are held to a different set of standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've been proven in a court of law as a sex offender and you
should be treated like one,'' Capuchino said. ``You should be
feared. He wants to walk around free and live a normal life, and I
don't think he should. I won't accept him.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Geffen represented the other side of the debate. She's
``not a bleeding heart liberal,'' but Geffen prefered ``to believe
the best of him, that that night was a one-time thing.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``I think everyone can make one mistake,'' Geffen said,
expressing an unpopular viewpoint. ``Any one of us, given the taste
or the temptation, might do something that we bitterly regret. I'm
sure there's not one of us who hasn't done something that we wish
we could take back, something that we say we'd give a year of our
life to take back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He sat out his 10 years and he deserves a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Statistically, there isn't any difference in the recidivism
rates of sex offenders who had been subject to notification and
those who had not, according to a 1995 study by the Washington
State Institute of Public Policy. However, the study did find that
offenders subject to community notification were arrested much more
quickly than comparable offenders who hadn't been subject to
notification.
</P>
<P>
   Of 125 of the most dangerous sex offenders released from
Washington State prisons between March 1, 1990 and Dec. 31, 1993,
18 of them, or 14 percent, were arrested for new sex offenses
within 54 months. And 63 percent of the new sex offenses occured in
the same jurisdiction where notification took place.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Geffen said she never felt threatened or scared by
Glenn's presence. In fact, she still would greet him if she saw him
on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not condoning what he did. I think it's utterly
disgusting,'' Geffen said. ``If I had my druthers, of course, I'd
rather he not live down the street from me, but I just think the
poor guy has to live somewhere. And until he does something to
prove the opposite, he deserves a second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   If he reoffends, she said, lock him up and throw away the key.
</P>
<P>
   Others found themselves unable to separate the intellect from
the emotion, the acceptance from the fear, the forgiveness from the
lingering prejudices. Although willing to concede that Glenn might
someday be able to prove himself to society and earn a second
chance, Akey steadfastly refused to be naive and say this
definitely wouldn't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   In her most liberal days 20 years ago, Akey would have
befriended Glenn. She used to say, ``Hello'' to him, but once she
knew who he was, Akey admitted, ``I would put my head down, look
away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people feel he should have a second chance but on the
way is he going to hurt somebody who doesn't deserve to be hurt?''
Akey said. ``There's still that little bit of a fear. It is too
bad. I would hate to have that happen to me. I wouldn't want people
to hate me.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fautsch, Glenn's boss, said he understands society's
apprehension about sex offenders, but he said that Glenn completed
the sentence that society handed down and it doesn't seem fair that
people judge him so harshly and won't let him move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do we draw the line?'' Fautsch asked. ``It's OK for
Clinton to do what he did. Here I've got a fellow who comes to me
and is open and tells me about his crime, and he's persecuted for
it. It stung Roger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To make everything black and white and not make anything a
grey area, it's sad. He's a genuine and sincere individual. He has
changed. . . He just wants to finish his life in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn says he has everything to lose if he doesn't toe the line,
and he's not willing to throw it all away. Rather, like many
others, he just wants to do his job, pay his bills and put
something away for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need any trouble,'' Glenn said. ``I just want to fit
in. I just work hard and try to be a good person, and it'll all
take care of itself, right?''
</P>
<P>
   But on an overcast day late last week, (THURS 4/29. GLENN TURNED
IN THE KEYS TO HIS LANDLORD ON FRIDAY 4/30.) moving vans pulled up
to the house on Driftwood Drive and Glenn packed his things inside.
Neighbors let out a big hoorah: Glenn is buying a house somewhere
in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   And another neighborhood will be notified about a sex offender
in its midst. Another neighborhood will be forced to confront its
intolerance. Another neighborhood will change the way it lives. &QL;

POWER STRUGGLE EXPOSES CRACKS IN NEW YORK CITY POLICE UNION
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association has long
served as the unified voice and jut-jawed defender of New York City
police officers, the architect of a blue wall of solidarity that
supports them, right or wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But as the union prepares to elect a president this month, the
campaign is revealing deep divisions within its leadership, even as
many officers look to the organization for help in reviving the
force's flagging morale.
</P>
<P>
   The dissension is apparent everywhere, from the vitriol of stump
speeches to the gaping disagreements among the candidates about how
the union should deal with the Police Department and the public.
</P>
<P>
   In station house appearances and campaign attack advertisements,
the four candidates often billy club one another with the relish of
professional politicians, using terms like liar and ``captain's
water boy.'' to disparage their opponents. Two have even sued the
union, asserting that it has acted unfairly to help the incumbent
president, James Savage, hold onto his job.
</P>
<P>
   The very fact that there will be an election is evidence of a
splintered, weaker union. For the last two decades, the PBA has
used the ballot box to pick a leader about as often as the Vatican
does.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Caruso held the office unchallenged for 15 years, and
when he resigned in 1995, he bequeathed the job to a handpicked
successor, Louis Matarazzo. The last time the city's largest police
union had a contested election for president was in 1980, when
America's image of the police was formed by television series like
``Starsky and Hutch.''
</P>
<P>
   But there has been no seamless transfer of power this time.
</P>
<P>
   Many union dissidents complained last December when Matarazzo
resigned with six months left in his term, allowing Savage, the
union's first vice president, to serve as president until the next
election.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he took office, it was clear that Savage would have to
fight to hold the job as challenger after challenger emerged,
warning of the malaise that was spreading through the union's
27,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   The mood has only darkened since. Though police officers have
been widely credited with causing the city's historic drop in
crime, many are walking their beats with drooping shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Their accomplishments have been overshadowed by accusations of
police brutality, racial insensitivity and excessive violence.
Their pay has fallen below that of many of their suburban
counterparts. And the union itself has been buffeted by a federal
investigation that has produced no indictments but has led to page
after page of unfavorable publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Savage has until May 21, when balloting begins, to convince
members that recent initiatives on his part, including a
no-confidence vote in the police commissioner that he engineered,
are evidence of a strong hand that will steer the union away from
the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   How he is doing is anyone's guess. Although the race has been
awash with the paraphernalia of modern politics, such as campaign
consultants and expensive fund-raisers, none of the four candidates
_ Savage; the union's recording secretary, James Higgins; the
Manhattan North trustee, Edward Mahoney, and a Brooklyn delegate,
Patrick Lynch _ have done any polling. They do not think officers
would be kindly disposed toward someone who called them at home to
pry into their political leanings.
</P>
<P>
   But the challengers, including the two longtime board members,
Higgins and Mahoney, have concluded that it is wise to talk about
reform in a union where power has long been closely held.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus for reform stems in part from a two-year-old
investigation by the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan into
possible corruption in the union's financial dealings. Though the
investigation appears dormant, three of the union's old lawyers
were convicted last year of racketeering in a kickback scheme
involving a different police union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recent events have led cops to believe that prosecutors are
against them, that the community doesn't understand them and that
their leadership in the Police Department and City Hall doesn't
support them financially,'' said Aaron Rosenthal, a former police
chief who teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.

CABLE CARRIER IS SAID TO PREFER AT&AMP;T MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The board of MediaOne Group Inc., the big cable television
carrier, sent a letter on Saturday to Comcast Corp. informing the
company that MediaOne wanted to proceed with a proposed merger with
AT&AMP;T Corp., people close to the discussions said Sunday. In effect,
the letter began a five-day timetable under which Comcast has until
Thursday to come back with a counteroffer.
</P>
<P>
   Comcast has been in intense discussions with America Online Inc.
and Microsoft Corp., which is already an investor in the cable
company, about those companies supporting its bid. Paul Allen, a
founder of Microsoft who left the company in 1983, has also
expressed interest in joining Comcast.
</P>
<P>
   Fashioning a bid is difficult and several options are being
explored, people close to the talks said. Microsoft has no obvious
motive for antagonizing AT&AMP;T, though it does have huge cash
reserves, which would make Comcast's $53 billion stock offer more
competitive with AT&AMP;T's $58 billion stock-and-cash bid. America
Online has motivation because it wants assurance that cable
operators will offer its service to their customers, though they
have no legal obligation to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, who owns cable systems with 4 million subscribers, might
want the alliance because it would let him swap some of his cable
systems for other more contiguous systems, one person close to the
talks said.
</P>
<P>
   Comcast needs a cash infusion because offering more Comcast
stock would not only depress its price but would still be less
appealing than AT&AMP;T's cash-and-stock offer.
</P>
<P>
   For any player joining Comcast's bid, one issue will be who gets
control of Comcast. When Brian Roberts, the president of Comcast,
originally announced the proposed acquisition of MediaOne, Comcast
orchestrated a deal in which it would have retained control of the
merged company even though MediaOne was a larger company.
</P>
<P>
   A person who has long followed Comcast said he could not imagine
that the Roberts family would be satisfied with any arrangement in
which the giant cable operator gave up control to an outsider.
Whether that would appeal to America Online, Microsoft or Allen is
unclear, but it is certainly likely to be an issue.

WIDOW OF FORMER PRESIDENT WINS RACE IN PANAMA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: UPDATES lede with Moscoso victory; ADDS 7th graf for quotes) 
(ATTN: Fla., Texas)  (rk) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ Mireya Moscoso, the widow of a Panamanian
president who stepped out on her own politically to become the main
opposition leader here, narrowly defeated her main opponent Sunday
night,making her the country's first woman president.
</P>
<P>
   With just 55 percent of the vote counted, official tallies
showed Ms. Moscoso, 52, with 43 percent. Martin Torrijos, the
35-year-old son of the late Panamanian strongman, Gen. Omar
Torrijos, followed with 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moscoso will lead the administration that acquires the
Panama Canal from the United States at the end of the year under
the 1977 Canal Treaty negotiated by the general with President
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Vallarino, 47, of a third political alliance, trailed
with 17 percent. He conceded shortly after 8 p.m. and wished Ms.
Moscoso ``success in leading this country in one of the periods of
major challenges but also of major opportunities in our history.''
</P>
<P>
   About an hour later, Torrijos publicly congratulated the winner
and announced to his supporters that he would seek to become
secretary-general of the Revolutionary Democratic Party, reorganize
the party and prepare to run again in the 2004 elections ``for the
benefit of the motherland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be sure that we have a future and that time does not
stop at this moment,'' he said to wild cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 10 p.m., Ms. Mos-H coso was welcomed by
supporters at a hotel here with shouts of ``Mireya! Mireya!'' while
caravans of honking cars could be heard around the city. She then
promised to given an ad- dress from her party's headquarters later
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today Mireya Moscoso didn't win,'' she said. ``The Panamanian
people won. We have a commitment with this country and thousands
and thousands of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The president is elected by a simple majority for a five-year
term starting Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanians also chose two vice-presidents, 71 legislators for
the unicameral Legislative Assembly and 74 mayors in tranquil
elections that appeared to be the third clean election of recent
years, solidifying a break from the country's history of massive
election fraud and political coups.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout among the 1.7 million registered voters was 74 percent,
and in many polling places the mood was relaxed, with little
partisan euphoria evident in or outside the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moscoso, owner of a coffee business inherited from her late
husband, Arnulfo Arias, for whom the Arnulfista Party was named,
ran on a populist platform that promised to end government
corruption and privatization policies that have left Panamanians
grumbling about higher rates for telephone and other services. This
was her second try at the presidency after losing 1994 elections to
the current president, Ernesto Perez Balladares.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This time, Ms. Moscoso had to overcome early polls that showed
her behind, criticism over her lack of college degrees and
government experience, and the ghost of the late general. Memory of
the general still resonates with many voters and his name was
constantly invoked by her opponent.
</P>
<P>
   To retaliate, she often referred to Torrijos, the candidate, by
the diminutive ``Martincito.''
</P>
<P>
   Torrijos, an economist with degrees from Texas A&AMP;M University
who served as deputy minister of government and justice in the
Perez Balladares administration, did not differ widely with Ms.
Moscoso on policy.
</P>
<P>
   The main thrust of his campaign was to offer a cleaner, less
arrogant image for the party once led by Gen. Manuel Noriega, who
was ousted in the American invasion of Panama in 1989 and is
serving a prison sentence in the United States on a drug-related
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   In her campaign, Ms. Moscoso drew on the memory of another
charismatic politician: her husband. Arias died in exile in Miami
in 1988 after a long career in which he won three elections as
president, but each time was removed from office by opponents, the
last time in 1968 in a military coup that installed the general as
ruler.
</P>
<P>
   While some Panamanians quipped that the campaign was thus a race
between ``two corpses,'' many voters expressed a desire to break
with the past, which Ms. Moscoso said she would offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the selfish leadership in the government has
appropriated the riches and national assets while the great
majorities are increasingly impoverished,'' she said in a fiery
speech at her own campaign closing rally last week. ``I promise you
a different government.''
</P>
<P>
   Voting Sunday morning at a school here, Jose Aparicio, 54, owner
of a business that does electrical work, said he voted for Ms.
Moscoso because he believed in alternating the parties in power.
``It was the Arnulfistas' turn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Repeated winners could think the country is theirs,'' he said.
``She has life experience and a strong character. You don't need
college to make good, logical decisions and think about the
country, not yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   With poverty and unemployment widespread, and a judicial system
in need of serious reform, many Panamanians also hope for a break
with the government corruption and nepotism of the past.

WHITE-KNUCKLE TIME FOR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-A'S-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ It might not rank with a locust invasion or
the killing of male first-borns, but for Jim Corsi, prince of
Newton, what is afflicting the Red Sox these days is something
straight out of the Old Testament, or a Steven Spielberg cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``A plague,'' Corsi said after the Red Sox fell, 7-5, to the
Oakland A's, who in one weekend accomplished what it took them all
of last season to do _ beat the Red Sox twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pitching when we weren't hitting, when we scored eight
runs in seven games,'' Corsi said, ``and now the plague is we're
not pitching well, except for the little short guy.''
</P>
<P>
   And Pedro Martinez can only work every five days. In the
meantime, knuckleballer Tim Wakefield took another early powder
Saturday, failing to make it out of the fourth inning for the third
time in his last four starts, and Corsi couldn't hold a lead for
the second time in three games after he replaced reliever Tim
Harikkala with two on and one out in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullpen's not doing too hot,'' acknowledged Corsi, who
walked the first batter he faced, Matt Stairs, gave up a two-run
single to the next batter, Jason Giambi, then a run-scoring double
to the Panamanian mystery man, Olmedo Saenz, who pronounced his hit
an act of sweet revenge after taking a Martinez bullet in the back
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Wasted was a three-run home run by third baseman John Valentin,
his first homer in 70 at-bats and only the second three-run home
run by the Sox this season in 24 games, a dozen apiece in the
won-and-loss columns.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin's fifth-inning home run came off A's starter Tom
Candiotti in the first matchup of fellow knuckleballers Wakefield
has had since facing Dennis Springer of the Angels almost three
years ago (Aug. 16, 1996). It gave the Sox a 5-4 lead in a game in
which Wakefield faced only five batters before returning the 2-0
lead the Sox presented him on a double by Jose Offerman, Valentin's
infield out, Brian Daubach's misplayed triple, and Nomar
Garciaparra's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield, who has allowed 18 earned runs in just 15 innings
(10.80 ERA) in his last four starts, went single, double, single,
double, RBI infield out before getting out of the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   He loaded the bases in the third but escaped with just a yield
of one run (Scott Spiezio's sacrifice fly) when the A's ran into
outs in two rundowns on one comebacker to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   When Wakefield walked the first two batters he faced in the
fourth, he was done for the day. In his last four starts, he has
pitched a total of 15 innings. Even counting his days in
Pittsburgh, where he was released by the Pirates, he's never had a
stretch in which his starts were so short-circuited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in a very good mood,'' Wakefield said quietly after
dressing. ``I don't have a whole lot to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   The message from manager Jimy Williams was simple: He still
plans on giving Wakefield the ball, even though Wakefield has a 3-7
record, 7.00 ERA, and six starts of four innings or less in a dozen
starts dating back to Aug. 30. That includes the inning and a third
he lasted in a Game 2 playoff loss to the Indians last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just keep pitching him,'' Williams said. ``He's going to
start. He's going to turn this thing around. He could turn it
around real quick. His next start, he could pitch a shutout.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the knuckleballer's lot to endure such droughts. Last
season, Wakefield also got off to a slow start (0-1, 6.00 ERA in
five starts), then reeled off six wins in a row en route to a
career-best 17-win season.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening with him right now is he's throwing 10 great
knuckleballs in a row, then the one he leaves up gets whacked,''
pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said. ``Every time he's making a
mistake, he's paying for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The puzzling thing with him is that he's had good side
sessions and good warmups. Maybe he needs to use a little more of
that swagger, that confident feeling on the mound. It may be more
of a mental thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going through a tough spell right now, but he'll get it
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox had one last chance to come back when A's closer Billy
Taylor walked the first two batters he faced, putting the tying
runs on base in the ninth. But Daubach struck out, Garciaparra
popped to short center, and Troy O'Leary tapped to second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing that a lot,'' said Garciaparra, who slammed
his bat down after just missing making solid connections. ``I've
got to keep swinging the bat. It's not like I'm trying to hit a
home run every time I'm up there.''
</P>
<P>
   He can't, because he seldom sees a pitch that he can drive.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, just file it under plagues.

hitters with an 0-and-2 count. So with two outs in the ninth inning
Sunday, the Mariners right fielder figured his former roommate in
the minor leagues might throw a fastball well out of the strike
zone, then come back with high heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows how I throw,'' Person said.
</P>
<P>
   Huskey had struck out three times off Toronto Blue Jays starter
Pat Hentgen, and he did not want to fan again. So he choked up,
hoping he could stay alive against Person with a foul ball.
</P>
<P>
   Person tried to come up and in, but missed in the strike zone.
It was a fatal mistake as Huskey lined the pitch into left field to
score Ken Griffey Jr. with the winning run in a stirring 3-2 win at
the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he's mad,'' Huskey said, smiling. ``I'm sure he's
calling me every name in the book.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Mariners side, there was only joy after a victory manager
Lou Piniella called one of his team's best. For the third time in
four days, the M's came from behind to win. The comeback was made
possible by pitchers Mac Suzuki and Ken Cloude, who together gave
up 15 runs to the Texas Rangers April 13 but had much different
results teaming up Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   While Suzuki and Cloude kept the M's close, Hentgen enjoyed his
usual dominance in Seattle. The former Cy Young winner is 4-1 with
a 1.85 earned run average in six starts here. Sunday, he allowed no
hits to the last 17 batters he faced, striking out eight in 71/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Things changed after Hentgen left the game. Reliever Peter Munro
got a double-play ball to end the eighth, but allowed a game-tying
homer to David Bell leading off the ninth. It was Bell's seventh
home run of the year _ more than Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, Albert
Belle and every member of the Colorado Rockies _ and it set up
Huskey's heroics.
</P>
<P>
   ``David's got more pop than Mac does,'' said M's catcher Tom
Lampkin, a former Cardinal. ``He's lucky he's not on the same team,
or (McGwire) would be taking a lot more flak than I'm giving him
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell, whose career high is 10, isn't thinking about home runs.
The more important thing about the homer, he said, is that it came
on a 3-and-1 count. That's symbolic of the new approach Bell has
taken since Piniella called him into the manager's office during
the last road trip and stressed patience at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Since that meeting in Chicago, Bell has walked nine times. Prior
to the meeting, he had walked once.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been so happy in my life to walk as I've been the
last week,'' Bell said. ``Lou took the time to call me in, and not
only has it helped the team, it's helped me, too. To be able to
pull that off over the last week is a good feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki and Cloude (3-1) can share in those good feelings. Suzuki
made the team in part because he was out of minor-league options,
and his first three outings this season came in relief in blowout
losses. The last was the Texas rout, and Suzuki did not pitch again
for 11 days.
</P>
<P>
   He started Sunday because Brett Hinchliffe, who has options, was
sent to Class AAA Tacoma to make room for new outfielder Brian
Hunter. But Suzuki performed so well, he earned a place in the
rotation and will start Friday at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's start was broadcast live in Japan, where the first
pitch came at 5:40 a.m. The early risers saw the Kobe native retire
the first seven Blue Jays before allowing a homer to Mike Matheny.
Suzuki got another out, then allowed a single and consecutive
walks.
</P>
<P>
   With Eric Weaver warming in the bullpen, Suzuki fell behind
3-and-0 to the dangerous Carlos Delgado. But he escaped harm by
getting Delgado to ground to second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily, the pitches that Mac threw had enough movement that
he didn't get the good part of the bat on the ball,'' Lampkin said.
``But those are not situations you like to find yourself in.''
</P>
<P>
   Two innings later, though, Suzuki found himself in a similar
spot against a different Toronto slugger, Shawn Green. With two out
and two on, Suzuki struck him out on a pitch so nasty it couldn't
be defined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to throw me a fastball, but I don't think that
was a fastball,'' Lampkin said. ``I came in the dugout and Lou
said, `What was that?' I said, `I don't know.' It was almost like a
split-finger or something that fell down pretty sharply at the end.
I almost didn't even get a glove on it. Whatever it was, it was a
good pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki left after allowing consecutive singles to open the
sixth. One of the runners scored, but Cloude followed with four
shutout innings. In five relief outings since starting that game
against Texas, Cloude is 3-0 with a 1.64 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki has claimed one rotation spot and John Halama is next in
line, but Cloude is content where he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've pretty much accepted it from the beginning,'' he said.
``I just approach it as if every pitch was my last one. I think my
trouble in the past has come when I out-think myself and give the
hitters too much credit instead of worrying about what I can do and
what I can make happen. There's no doubt I'm a lot more
confident.''

VALENTIN FIELDS CRITICISM, FIRES BACK 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-VALENTIN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ John Valentin doesn't dispute the empirical
evidence. The fans' eyes are not deceiving them.
</P>
<P>
   It's true he failed to run out a ground ball last weekend at
Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   It's true he was tagged out at the plate two weeks ago without
attempting to slide, also at home.
</P>
<P>
   It's true he let a popped bunt drop in front of him without
attempting to make a diving catch here the other day.
</P>
<P>
   And it's true that he hit just .195 in April while scoring only
seven runs.
</P>
<P>
   But it's how people choose to spin those facts that Valentin
challenges. The Red Sox third baseman, aware that he has become a
target of criticism, disputes anyone who questions his desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, it's been very frustrating, that's all I can say,''
Valentin said before driving in four runs Sunday with a three-run
home run, his first homer in 70 at-bats, and an infield out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the fans should know this. This is my eighth year here,
and I bust my butt for them because they pay my salary. I play hard
for the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I may not have run a ball out because of frustration
that I'm not playing well, but for someone to question my work
ethic when they haven't even seen me practice or how I prepare is
unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin does not defend his failure to run out a ground ball
against the Indians last weekend. Had he run through the bag, he
may have been safe, because the throw pulled first baseman Jim
Thome off the bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no excuse for that,'' he said, ``but I probably was
disgusted with myself.''
</P>
<P>
   On the play at the plate against the Devil Rays, when he was
thrown out attempting to score from second, Valentin said he got a
late read on the play and consequently a poor jump, and the throw
from center field was up the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that it looked bad that I didn't slide,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bunt attempt, which went foul Friday night, Valentin waved
off. ``If I thought I had a play, I probably would have dove,'' he
said. ``But in the spectator's eyes, I can see where someone might
have questioned it.''
</P>
<P>
   Slow starts are nothing new, of course, for Valentin. Two years
ago, he hit just .160 in April. Last season, he hit .264 in April,
but followed that with a .216 average in May.
</P>
<P>
   He is showing signs of coming out of his slump, with hits in
seven of his last eight games, including two doubles and a single
Saturday and Sunday's home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the field, obviously, I'm not hitting,'' he said. ``I'm
trying to get that going, and it's been somewhat frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Off the field? Those frustrations, Valentin keeps to himself. He
has nothing to gain talking any further about the absence of Mo
Vaughn, how it has impacted him both personally and professionally,
robbing him of a friend while weakening a lineup that needed
another righthanded bat even when Vaughn was here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want people to understand,'' he said, ``that I'm still
here, busting my butt.''

SOCHA BLASTS OFFSIDE CALLS

<TEXT>
<P>
   CRANSTON, R.I. _ David Socha viewed the Revolution's 2-1 loss to
Colorado Saturday and, like coaches Giuseppe Galderisi and Walter
Zenga, he was not impressed by the officiating.
</P>
<P>
   Socha has a different perspective than the Revolution leaders.
Socha was the top referee in the United States in the 1980s, the
only American to be selected for two World Cup finals and an
Olympic Games tournament. In fact, Socha retired soon after
refereeing Italy's 3-2 win over South Korea in the Mexico '86 World
Cup, a game in which Galderisi played.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution were upset by the method of determining offside,
arguing that the linesmen were slow in signaling the violation.
According to Socha, the linesman, or referee's assistant, should
immediately raise the flag if offside occurs, but the referee has
the final say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the trouble with offside is that FIFA has confused the
linesmen,'' said Socha, who was inducted into the New England
Soccer Hall of Fame Sunday. ``They tell them not to call offside if
the players are even. But it is a split-second judgment and you
can't stand there and think it over. But how are you going to do it
when you've never played at that level? How are you ever going to
have the reactions?''
</P>
<P>
   Socha believes that MLS referees are at a disadvantage because
they are lacking top-level experience. The North American Soccer
League, which produced several FIFA referees, had a much higher
standard of play than the MLS.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were veteran players, but there were also great young
players,'' Socha said. ``Hugo Sanchez went on to become the top
goal-getter in Spain (with Real Madrid) and Bruce Grobelaar played
for years with Liverpool. Where are those type of players now?
</P>
<P>
   ``The NASL was producing some very good players and the New York
Cosmos were the Real Madrid of the Western Hemisphere and they were
drawing big crowds. The NASL was the most difficult league in the
world to referee because of the different nationalities and styles
of play. That made it a great training ground for referees at the
international level.''
</P>
<P>
   Socha understands the gamesmanship and cutthroat politics of
international soccer. Yet, after a dispute with the US Soccer
Federation he has not been used even in an advisory role by the
USSF or MLS.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the professional game in this country is that
the people in charge are not qualified,'' Socha said. ``So many of
the inspectors never played the game at that level and don't
understand it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go from the college system to refereeing at the pro
level. That system is wrong. Where can they get experience? In the
ethnic leagues, where people are passionate and really know the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Revolution coaches pursuing the officiating crew
after the game, Socha said:
</P>
<P>
   ``The referee has to get respect from everyone. Once they know
where you are coming from, they won't do things like that. Listen,
these guys (Galderisi and Zenga) are coming from a place where they
go to school to learn how to bait the referee. They are very
refined about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, many of the referees are too young, and that is
because FIFA lowered the mandatory age of retirement, so they don't
have the experience. It's like a player; if you understand the game
you don't have to run needlessly. You pace yourself, like a player.
If you can read the game, you don't have to run all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``In soccer, the referee is the maestro, the conductor. And the
game can be either a beautiful symphony or a catastrophe.''

WALKER MAY HAVE RUN OF THE PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ Over the past fortnight, he has been a
spectator. We've seen Antoine Walker cheer, coax, and wear some
serious threads. Monday night, he plans to be wearing something
different: A green-and-white uniform.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics' captain went through what coach Rick Pitino termed
``a walk-through-type'' practice Sunday at Healthpoint and said his
sprained left ankle felt fine. Barring a blowup, Walker said he
will be ready to go Monday night against the Knicks in Madison
Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Who could have predicted this 15 days ago when Walker left MCI
Arena on crutches? Certainly not Pitino, who has been telling
everyone that Walker would not make it back. But we never heard
that from Walker. He vowed to return and it appears he will for the
final two games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll wait and see how it reacts,'' he said Sunday before
heading for the team plane. ``I went through the whole practice and
I did everything. We'll see how it feels, but I'm going to try to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino said, ``He's out of shape, but he's moving well. He moved
well, he's not limping or anything. He's just out of shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Being out of shape, of course, is a no-no in the Pitino system,
but with only a couple games left, and with an opportunity to delay
the likely Knicks' playoff clincher, why not? It's not clear if
Walker would start, but the guess is that he will if he makes it
through the night without further pain or swelling.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics haven't missed Walker (or Kenny Anderson, for that
matter) as much as one might have thought. Boston won the game in
Washington after Walker went down five minutes into the game. Since
then, the Celtics have been 3-5, but only 1-4 at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Celtics have had some of their most efficient
offensive performances in that stretch. They shot 55 percent in a
still-astonishing 107-96 victory at Miami. They shot 54 percent in
a home bludgeoning of the Wizards and also won a wire-to-wire
thriller by 29 in Chicago. Since Walker went down, Paul Pierce has
averaged 21.5 points a game to lead the team in the last nine
games. He's been the top scorer in seven of the games.
</P>
<P>
   Before getting hurt, Walker appeared to be rounding into form.
In the game before the Wizards game, he had scored 29 against
Miami, including an improbable game-winning trey with 7-10ths of a
second to play. That more than made up for his 6-point performance
two nights earlier, one in which he was again booed by the
FleetCenter fans and subsequently offered that he might not be the
kind of player that Celtics fans embrace.
</P>
<P>
   The return of Walker also should give Pitino some manpower,
something he's sorely lacking. On Saturday against Milwaukee, his
bench consisted of Walter McCarty, Eric Riley, Marlon Garnett,
Damon Jones, and Dwayne Schintzius. All but Schintzius played. Only
McCarty (7 points) scored. The Bucks bench produced 44 points from
players such as Sam Cassell, Armon Gilliam, Vinny Del Negro, and
Michael Curry.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics will have a say in who gets the last playoff spot in
the East. The Knicks got smoked Sunday by the Pacers (94-71) which
dropped them to 4-2 since Dave Checketts jettisoned general manager
Ernie Grunfeld. With Charlotte losing Sunday night to Miami, the
Knicks could clinch a playoff spot with a win Monday night because
they hold the tie-breaker over the Hornets . . . Anderson did not
make the trip. When asked why he wasn't going, especially since the
game was in his native New York, he smiled and cracked, ``because I
love Boston so much.'' . . . This will be Boston's ninth appearance
on network television, including NBC. They are 3-5 in big-time TV
games, with three of the losses coming to Indiana and two of the
wins coming against Miami. The other win was against New York Feb.
26 at the FleetCenter . . . One of the benefits of Walker's injury
has been a dearth of technical fouls. There've been only two
against Boston in the last nine games. One was for an illegal
defense violation and the other was assessed to Tony Battie for
hanging on the rim.

DENVER SHARES IN PERSONAL GRIEF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BETH BARRETT and GREG GITTRICH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ This area's grief in the wake of the Columbine High
School shootings is as broad as a country mourning a national hero
but as personal as a family struggling with its most intimate pain.
</P>
<P>
   The Greater Denver area, with more than 1.5 million residents,
is emotionally broken and still bleeding from the April 20 massacre
in suburban Littleton. People are struggling to regain a sense of
peace.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, while Coloradans joined with other Americans in
celebrating the release of three prisoners of war in Yugoslavia,
they also had to cope with yet another memorial service for the
Columbine students _ the final service, as it was billed.
</P>
<P>
   Across Greater Denver, billboards that would normally blare
sports slogans or National Rifle Association advertisements read,
``Pray for the Kids.'' And the marquee outside a Hooters restaurant
tells the children, ``Columbine, Our Prayers Are With You.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio stations play over and over the song ``Columbine,'' a
rallying cry written and sung by two classmates of the 12 students,
two killers and a teacher slain in the April 20 massacre.
</P>
<P>
   A Nordstrom store has shrouded its windows in silver and blue,
the school colors.
</P>
<P>
   Froggy's Flowers in Littleton has been flooded with requests for
colombine, a purple flower not yet in season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blood Brother,'' a musical just in from London about a double
murder, has transformed from light entertainment into an operatic
tale of morality, with refunds offered to those who just couldn't
bear to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from being the Super Bowl champions to being a city
where we wonder if our children are safe, from a place where
everyone wondered whether Elway would retire to a worried city
filled with grief,'' said Dr. Robert Freedman, a Denver-based
national expert on mental disorders in children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole city changed in one week,'' added Freedman, whose
son once participated in a debate in the Columbine library, which
was turned into a bloody battlefield by Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold.
</P>
<P>
   ``This community has lost its innocence,'' he sighed.
</P>
<P>
   As mountains of wilting flowers in Clement Park hallow the
nearby Rockies, a deeply religious community is turning its weeping
eyes inward and asking, What is wrong with our soul? What have we
done wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Denver's Archbishop Charles Chaput told nearly 2,000 mourners at
the funeral for sophomores Kelly Ann Fleming and Daniel Mauser that
a culture of killing in America, which permits abortion, euthanasia
and the death penalty, is very much to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be cut to the heart by what has happened, so that
we might personally convert and work for changes in society,''
Chaput said.
</P>
<P>
   Focus on the Family, a powerful religious organization in
Colorado Springs, has placed full-page ads in newspapers around the
metropolitan area. The ads urged readers to observe a moment of
silence on behalf of all those victimized by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is happening in Denver is people are putting their arms
around everyone, regardless of whether they believe or don't
believe in God,'' said H.B. London, vice president of Ministries
for Reach and Pastoral Ministries for the religious group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all lost children, we all suffered pain, and each of us
will deal with it with the resources we have.''
</P>
<P>
   The hauntingly personal nature of the killings, where students
were singled out and killed, has thrust a new layer of horror on
top of what has become an all-too-common phenomenon of kids killing
kids in American schools over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Isaiah Shoels was gunned down because he was African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Cassie Bernall was killed after she professed her faith when
asked by a gunman if she believed in God.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religion and faith are not at fault,'' said the Rev. George
Kirsten, Cassie's pastor at West Bowles Community Church. ``The
kids are really getting strength and hope in the same Christ Cassie
believed in.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Hummel, a grief counselor and clinical social worker at the
Denver Hospice, cautions the most profound grieving hasn't even
begun.
</P>
<P>
   Students from Columbine High School and people in the immediate
area are still in shock and will soon experience nightmares,
flashbacks and other types of post-traumatic stress as their lives
slowly regain normalcy, Hummel said.
</P>
<P>
   The grieving is going to be complicated because the killings
were sudden and unexpected, violent and destructive, random and
possibly preventable, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the heart of this, this event does not make sense. It has
blind-sided everyone,'' Hummel said. ``There is an inability to
grasp the meaning of this and has knocked everyone for a loop. You
feel secure about what your city stands for and its great quality
of life, and then it's like your secure base has been attacked.''
</P>
<P>
   Hummel warned that maxims like ``God will provide for the
victims'' or ``God must have needed another angel'' are not
particularly helpful for those struggling to cope with a loss.
</P>
<P>
   The only real rules of grief support are to ``not tell people
how to be or how to view their loss,'' she said. ``Remember to
listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of others, Los Angeles musician Mark Spiegel says
he cried when he saw the vivid television footage of prostrate,
bleeding bodies lying on the pavement; rag-doll forms carried by
paramedics to waiting ambulances; and terrified teen-agers,
crouching next to walls before racing to safety with an awkward
gait.
</P>
<P>
   Spiegel wrote a song and sent it to the Denver Post, hoping it
would find its way to survivors:
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be with you, you'll be with us. ... We all have ways to
deal with grief.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to do something, just something. I have a 13-year-old
son,'' Spiegel said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Marino, a 17-year-old senior, missed the gunmen by
minutes on his way back from lunch. His best friend Patrick Ireland
wasn't so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland will be forever remembered as the boy who galvanized the
nation when he broke out a library window and tumbled _ limp and
bleeding _ into the arms of a SWAT team below on live TV.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hurtful,'' Marino said quietly yet so stoically, last
week as he left Centura St. Anthony Hospital, that it made the
grown-ups by his side weep.
</P>
<P>
   In an agonizing procession of eulogies for the dozen students
killed and for teacher Dave Sanders, as well as at a private
service attended by a handful of people for one of the killers, the
only question that mattered was, Why?
</P>
<P>
   Pastors struggled for the right words.
</P>
<P>
   ``God holds us in the palm of God's hand,'' said the Rev. Dwight
Blackstock of Grace Presbyterian Church, as he stood before the
coffin of 15-year-old Daniel Lee Rohrbough.
</P>
<P>
   What else can one say when the pallbearers aren't even old
enough to drive?
</P>
<P>
   Columbine senior Nick Foss still trembles when he speaks of
Danny, wishing he could have comforted the boy who died by his
side. ``But he was already gone,'' Foss said.
</P>
<P>
   Foss' friend Kevin Aberd, a Columbine senior, said it hurts to
see how hard his classmates are taking it all. A week after the
shooting, he worries whether Foss is moving on. But grief is such a
private matter, and he respects that.
</P>
<P>
   Aberd was barricaded in the choir room for three hours, praying
for help, as gunfire and exploding pipe bombs replaced the sound of
baritones. Now he flings his grief into the sky with every flip of
his Frisbee. ``We're trying to move on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the marrow of the matter, where the desire for revenge meets
the hope for healing, moving on can be nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``How I wish to God they'd catch the other kids,'' Aberd said,
speculating with deputies that other teen-agers may have been
involved in planting bombs inside the school. But what should
happen then, what is just and fair and right?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. I really don't,'' Aberd said after hesitating.
</P>
<P>
   A world of pep rallies, proms and adolescent anxieties poses
inherent limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the teen-agers are trying to pick themselves out of a
morass of hate with the confidence of youth and the last shreds of
innocence that remain in their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are Columbine! We are Columbine!'' The cheer rumbled
through the crowd of at least 70,000 at last week's memorial, an
inexorable, defiant chant of solidarity and of a promising future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give people a hug, say hi to everyone, say, What's up?'' Aberd
suggested. ``Make sure you say it to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But after all the hellos and goodbyes, the healing must begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a heck of a lot of loneliness in the Denver area,''
said Dick Berger, a Jefferson County resident and executive
director of a small, volunteer-based suicide, depression and crisis
hotline based in Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tendency in suburbia to cover things up or to not
acknowledge problems and those who are different. In my estimation,
that can be a goddamned pain in the tush,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Garbarino, a Cornell University professor and author
of ``Lost Boys,'' a book about troubled teens, stressed there can
be no simple, easy or formulaic answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we persist in calling these just senseless killings by
wacko kids, then we are almost guaranteeing this kind of thing will
happen again,`` Garbarino said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are, then the social factory that produces this
product will continue. The answer is to stop the factory.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurting and troubled boys crash to Earth _ sometimes taking
others with them _ when the stresses of their lives pile up
intolerably. Shame, abuse, mental illness and appealing but dark
subcultures all contribute, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine, a boy building a tower of blocks out of those
things,'' Garbarino said. ``Then it falls, and which block do you
blame?''
</P>
<P>
   Adults have not found effective ways to penetrate the mask of
normalcy that so many at-risk teens wear while living in a kind of
parallel universe, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Easily available guns, point-and-shoot video games, deadly codes
of silence among teen-agers, and an obsession with material
possessions affect troubled teens in ways that today's parents,
teachers and mental health providers often can't counteract.
</P>
<P>
   Too often adults withdraw and simply ``cross their fingers,''
Garbarino said.
</P>
<P>
   Outcast juveniles are more likely to adopt deadly roles as their
fascination with darker aspects of culture increases, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids are prone to the melodramatic,'' Garbarino added.
``And these boys have a tremendous sense of righteousness, of a
higher purpose and of legitimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the truth may be that the grief will never
entirely disappear in Denver, said Robert Kladifko, the Reseda High
School principal who in 1993 carried dying senior Micheal Ensley in
his arms to the school nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you learn to handle it,'' Kladifko said. ``You learn to
cope.''
</P>
<P>
   The school has developed a nationally recognized violence
intervention program, Weapons Are Removed Now, where, starting in
elementary school, kids are taught to report weapons on campus. It
also has a ``unity council,'' where schoolteachers act as watchdogs
and conflict counselors. Now students are writing letters of
encouragement to Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the hurt so fresh, there are signs that hope is
beginning once again to bud at the high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be OK,'' Aberd said.
</P>
<P>
   Then expressing one hard-learned lesson of the tragedy, he
added, ``We're not just a school. We're a family.''

LUKAS'S EYES TRAINED ON ANOTHER DERBY 
</HEADLINE>
 DERBY-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Trainer D. Wayne Lukas already has won four
Kentucky Derbys, but his quest has just begun.
</P>
<P>
   When Charismatic crossed the finish line first in Saturday's
125th Run for the Roses at Churchill Downs, it tied Lukas with H.J.
Thompson, who won the Derby twice in the 1920s and twice in the
'30s. The only one in front of Lukas now is Ben Jones, legendary
trainer of Calumet Farm, who won six, one in the '30s, four in the
'40s, and one in the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see why I can't break the record,'' said the
63-year-old Lukas Sunday. ``I like what I'm doing, I have the
clientele, and I could win a few more. I've got 60 2-year-olds, and
some of them we like.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, who first participated in the Derby in 1981, has started
a record 35 horses in America's greatest race, and his winners
before Charismatic were Winning Colors (1988), Thunder Gulch ('95),
and Grindstone ('96). Lukas also has won the Preakness four times.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Derby, in which he was 31-1 ($64.60 to win) under
Chris Antley, Charismatic had run 14 races and won only three
times. Until he captured the Grade II Lexington at Keeneland April
18, his only two victories had come in claiming races. Charismatic,
a true distance horse, outlasted the others in the Derby, while
running 10 furlongs in a slow 2:03 1/5, but it is highly unlikely
he will be favored in the Preakness at Pimlico May 15, an event
much more conducive to speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK, the horse doesn't know,'' said Lukas. ``Charismatic
was a claimer because I misread him very badly. That's when the
experience factor as a trainer came into play. I changed up on him,
giving him long, fast gallops, and it worked. It could have gone
the other way, and he'd have been running for a $35,000 claiming
tag. But I've learned you have to take your shot.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that Charismatic, who was astutely kept wide
by Antley, took advantage of the crowding, bumping, and blocking
that went on in the 19-horse field. The roughness of the race
eliminated several logical contenders, most notably the Bob
Baffert-trained entry of Excellent Meeting and General Challenge,
which was favored at 3-1. Not surprisingly, Lukas is not in favor
of reducing the Derby field from the allowed maximum of 20. The
Preakness, for example, allows only 14 (determined by overall
earnings), the number that can fit in one starting gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't ask the people who put up the money for the
high-priced yearlings not to run in the Derby,'' said Lukas. ``You
can't take away their dream. What should we do, make the Indy 500 a
six-car race?''
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic's triumph concluded a sensational week for Lukas,
who was elected into the Hall of Fame Tuesday, and he has, at least
temporarily, regained his position atop the training leaderboard
from Baffert, who had saddled the previous two Derby winners. There
is some rivalry between the two, especially where owners Bob and
Beverly Lewis are concerned. The Lewises employ both as trainers,
and allow Baffert and Lukas to pick the yearlings they buy. Baffert
came up with Silver Charm, who won the Derby for the Lewises in
1997, for $120,000, and Lukas recommended Charismatic, who cost
$200,000. And, Sunday, Lukas couldn't resist a good-natured shot at
Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat everybody who showed up, that's all we can do,'' said
Lukas. ``Did I out-train the other guys or what? That sounds like
Bob Baffert.''
</P>
<P>
   Racing is a money game, and Lukas freely admits he likes to
count his cash. When he spoke about his election to the Hall, he
mentioned that the fact his stable is on the verge of becoming the
first to earn $200 million in purses was his proudest
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday he was asked, other than the history involved, what
thrilled him most about taking the Derby. ``The $886,200 that goes
to the winner.'' he replied. ``Old Wayne has a lot of bills to
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The list of horses whose connections are considering the
Preakness numbers 18, including 11 who contested the Derby. In
addition to Charismatic, who will seek the Triple Crown; Menifee,
who was second; Cat Thief, trained by Lukas and third; Prime
Timber, trained by Baffert and fourth; Kimberlite Pipe, sixth;
Worldly Manner, seventh; K One King, eighth; Lemon Drop Kid, ninth;
Stephen Got Even, 14th; Adonis; 17th, and Vicar, 18th, are being
pointed to Pimlico.
</P>
<P>
   Of the seven horses who did not run in the Derby, but appear
headed to Baltimore, Silverbulletday, who won the Kentucky Oaks for
Baffert at 1-10 in a tour de force, would be the biggest threat.
Also in that group are: Patience Game, impressive winner of the
Derby Trial; Talk's Cheap, winner of the the Tesio Stakes, a
Pimlico prep for the Preakness; Millions, third in the Tesio as the
choice, Torrid Sand, third in the Arkansas Derby; Forty One Carats,
second in the Flamingo at Hialeah; and Badge, fourth in the Wood
Memorial as the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot written about Valhol, who was allowed to enter
the Derby only after a court ordered the purse he won in the
Arkansas Derby released following controversy over whether his
jockey used an electrical device during the race. However, Valhol,
who won the Arkansas Derby as a maiden, performed poorly, as most
observers suspected he would, fading to 15th after taking the lead
under Willie Martinez. ``I don't know where he'll go, but there are
some good races coming up right now,'' said trainer Dallas Keen.
``I don't think that we are going to the Preakness. We'll go to
Lone Star (outside Dallas) for a while, and see how he does. Hey,
he's eligible for non-winners of two races at Lone Star. I
definitely did not want him on the front end. He jumped tracks the
first time past the wire, and when the jock reached up to grab him,
he just took off.''

WHITE-KNUCKLE TIME FOR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-A'S-BOS-2   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ It might not rank with a locust invasion or
the killing of male first-borns, but for Jim Corsi, prince of
Newton, what is afflicting the Red Sox these days is something
straight out of the Old Testament, or a Steven Spielberg cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``A plague,'' Corsi said after the Red Sox fell, 7-5, to the
Oakland A's, who in one weekend accomplished what it took them all
of last season to do _ beat the Red Sox twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pitching when we weren't hitting, when we scored eight
runs in seven games,'' Corsi said, ``and now the plague is we're
not pitching well, except for the little short guy.''
</P>
<P>
   And Pedro Martinez can only work every five days. In the
meantime, knuckleballer Tim Wakefield took another early powder
Sunday, failing to make it out of the fourth inning for the third
time in his last four starts, and Corsi couldn't hold a lead for
the second time in three games after he replaced reliever Tim
Harikkala with two on and one out in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullpen's not doing too hot,'' acknowledged Corsi, who
walked the first batter he faced, Matt Stairs, gave up a two-run
single to the next batter, Jason Giambi, then a run-scoring double
to the Panamanian mystery man, Olmedo Saenz, who pronounced his hit
an act of sweet revenge after taking a Martinez bullet in the back
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Wasted was a three-run home run by third baseman John Valentin,
his first homer in 70 at-bats and only the second three-run home
run by the Sox this season in 24 games, a dozen apiece in the
won-and-loss columns.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin's fifth-inning home run came off A's starter Tom
Candiotti in the first matchup of fellow knuckleballers Wakefield
has had since facing Dennis Springer of the Angels almost three
years ago (Aug. 16, 1996). It gave the Sox a 5-4 lead in a game in
which Wakefield faced only five batters before returning the 2-0
lead the Sox presented him on a double by Jose Offerman, Valentin's
infield out, Brian Daubach's misplayed triple, and Nomar
Garciaparra's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield, who has allowed 18 earned runs in just 15 innings
(10.80 ERA) in his last four starts, went single, double, single,
double, RBI infield out before getting out of the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   He loaded the bases in the third but escaped with just a yield
of one run (Scott Spiezio's sacrifice fly) when the A's ran into
outs in two rundowns on one comebacker to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   When Wakefield walked the first two batters he faced in the
fourth, he was done for the day. In his last four starts, he has
pitched a total of 15 innings. Even counting his days in
Pittsburgh, where he was released by the Pirates, he's never had a
stretch in which his starts were so short-circuited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in a very good mood,'' Wakefield said quietly after
dressing. ``I don't have a whole lot to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   The message from manager Jimy Williams was simple: He still
plans on giving Wakefield the ball, even though Wakefield has a 3-7
record, 7.00 ERA, and six starts of four innings or less in a dozen
starts dating back to Aug. 30. That includes the inning and a third
he lasted in a Game 2 playoff loss to the Indians last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just keep pitching him,'' Williams said. ``He's going to
start. He's going to turn this thing around. He could turn it
around real quick. His next start, he could pitch a shutout.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the knuckleballer's lot to endure such droughts. Last
season, Wakefield also got off to a slow start (0-1, 6.00 ERA in
five starts), then reeled off six wins in a row en route to a
career-best 17-win season.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening with him right now is he's throwing 10 great
knuckleballs in a row, then the one he leaves up gets whacked,''
pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said. ``Every time he's making a
mistake, he's paying for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The puzzling thing with him is that he's had good side
sessions and good warmups. Maybe he needs to use a little more of
that swagger, that confident feeling on the mound. It may be more
of a mental thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going through a tough spell right now, but he'll get it
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox had one last chance to come back when A's closer Billy
Taylor walked the first two batters he faced, putting the tying
runs on base in the ninth. But Daubach struck out, Garciaparra
popped to short center, and Troy O'Leary tapped to second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing that a lot,'' said Garciaparra, who slammed
his bat down after just missing making solid connections. ``I've
got to keep swinging the bat. It's not like I'm trying to hit a
home run every time I'm up there.''
</P>
<P>
   He can't, because he seldom sees a pitch that he can drive.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, just file it under plagues.

REPORT: DODGERS ACCUSED OF TRYOUTS IN CUBA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Two players in the Los Angeles Dodgers'
minor-league system told the Boston Globe the club held secret
tryouts in Cuba, arranged escapes from the communist country and
were told to lie about it.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper reported Juan Carlos Diaz and Josue Perez asked
the commissioner's office of Major League Baseball to declare them
free agents on grounds they signed illegally. Baseball rules
prohibit teams from scouting in Cuba, and the United States has a
trade embargo against communist nations.
</P>
<P>
   The players said they were first contacted by Pablo Peguero, who
is the general manager for the Dodgers' Campo Las Palmas baseball
complex in the Dominican Republic, while in Cuba. Perez, 21, an
outfielder with Single-A Vero Beach, was signed by Peguero in March
1998. Diaz, 23, a first baseman at Double-A San Antonio, was signed
by Peguero and Ralph Avila, vice president of Campo Las Palmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said I brought them to the Dodgers from Cuba, but that's
not true,'' Peguero said via telephone from his home in the
Dominican Republic. ``After they got here, they got their
(provisional) release papers. After that, they signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have nothing to do with it. Ralph Avila signed them. I
know he signed them in his office. I was there the day they
signed.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz told the Globe that Peguero was at a game in 1995 and saw
him play in Havana, Cuba, and soon after staged a tryout for Diaz.
A few months later Peguero brought a lady to Cuba and Diaz was
invited to the Dominican Republic on the premise it was in return
for Diaz's help in finding a Cuban surgeon for the women, the
player said.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz signed with the Dodgers and was given a $65,000 bonus.
Perez told a similar story about Peguero coming to Cuba with a
woman in 1996. Peguero said he hasn't been to Cuba in more than a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they paid off people or not, but I got my
provisional release papers, which enabled me to sign,'' Diaz told
the Boston newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers officials wouldn't comment on the situation, saying they
haven't heard from Major League Baseball. ``We have not received
anything from the commissioner's office,'' said Dodgers assistant
to the general manager/minor league director Bill Geivett. ``Until
we receive word from them, if we receive word from them, it's tough
to tell what we're dealing with, if anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers generThe Dodgers wanted to take advantage of Hansen's
left-handed bat against Phillies righty Curt Schilling,, and Hansen
responded by continuing his awesome start.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen went 2 for 3 with a walk to raise his average to .625 (10
for 16).
</P>
<P>
   ``Sshhhh, I make a conscious effort not to know what I'm
hitting,'' Hansen said at the mere suggestion of his success. ``I
have to go at-bat to at-bat. That's the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Extra bases: The Dodgers will keep an eye on right-hander
Heathcliff Slocumb, recently released by the Orioles, in case
things don't work out with Antonio Osuna's elbow or Mike Maddux....
If the Dodgers activate Osuna before today's game in Montreal,
lefty reliever Jeff Kubenka is the likely candidate to be shipped
out. Kubenka, the third lefty in the bullpen, had his second awful
outing in three appearances. In a game Johnson all but conceded in
the ninth, he had to take Kubenka out. He gave up five hits and six
runs (four earned) and saw his ERA balloon from 12.27 to 20.25, and
Johnson hasn't shown confidence in using Kubenka in a big spot. In
his first appearance of the season, Kubenka was tagged with the
loss when he allowed five runs in 12/3 innings of an extra-inning
loss to Atlanta.

ANGELS BEAT WHITE SOX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It had been almost a year since the Anaheim
Angels had gotten a complete game from their pitching staff. It has
been a lot longer since any of their pitchers has received much
respect.
</P>
<P>
   But when Omar Olivares went the distance Sunday night to defeat
the Chicago White Sox 6-3 in front of 34,737 at Edison Field, the
Angels had the look of a team that had found a missing ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth consecutive game, their starters pitched at least
seven innings. Sure the Angels got home runs from Garret Anderson
and journeyman Tim Unroe. But it was Olivares' night that gave the
Angels (12-13) their fourth victory in five games and represented
what the rotation can mean to the team's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what is going to make the difference in this season,''
manager Terry Collins said. ``We have an excellent bullpen, but you
have to take the load off them. Guys are starting to come up big.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivares (3-2) needed just 102 pitches to get through a White
Sox lineup that battered closer Troy Percival for five ninth-inning
runs Saturday night. Percival, who had pitched in three of the four
previous games, warmed up Sunday but wasn't needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was important to me,'' said Olivares, who also pitched
the Angels' last complete game, on May 22. ``Every night,
(Percival) is up. Every night, the offense is doing big things. But
we know we have good starters. Now it is showing.''
</P>
<P>
   Today will be another test when the struggling Tim Belcher faces
the White Sox in the final game of an eight-game homestand. Belcher
blew a 10-run lead to Toronto in his last start.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares allowed five hits and two earned runs, including Chris
Singleton's first major-league home run. He got 16 ground-ball
outs, two on a dazzling stop by third baseman Troy Glaus that
started an inning-ending double play in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Plays like that kept the White Sox, one of the league's surprise
teams, from getting to Olivares. The Angels roughed up Chicago
left-hander Jim Parque (3-2) for eight hits and four runs in five
innings, but Collins said if the game had been close, he would have
used Percival in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him if he could go and he said, `Yes,''' Collins said.
``That's what we pay him for.''
</P>
<P>
   Parque, the former standout at Crescenta Valley High School and
UCLA, has been the top left-hander on a White Sox staff that leads
the American League in ERA.
</P>
<P>
   But after Singleton's homer gave Chicago a 1-0 lead in the
third, the Angels immediately got the run back on an RBI single by
Salmon. They added two more in the fifth when Parque walked the
bases loaded and Salmon and Glaus had back-to-back sacrifice flies.
Parque was done after just two batters in the sixth. Unroe opened
with a home run to left, his first in the majors since 1997 when he
played with Milwaukee, and Matt Walbeck walked.
</P>
<P>
   In came right-hander Keith Folkes, who appeared to get out of
trouble when he retired Mo Vaughn and Tim Salmon with the bases
loaded to end the sixth. But Glaus opened the seventh with a double
and Anderson hit his fifth homer to give the Angels a 6-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The rest was all Olivares, who was coming off his worst outing
of the season, a 10-1 loss to Toronto last Monday. He retired 10 of
the final 11 batters. The only one to reach was catcher Mark
Johnson, who got on when Olivares bobbled his comebacker to the
mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we have been playing on defense, I guess I had to be
the one to mess things up,'' Olivares said. ``But I could tell by
the second inning that things were going well. My sinker was
working inside and out.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Finley knows that is not always enough. He pitched seven
strong innings Saturday only to lose a chance for the victory when
Percival blew the save opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   But Finley knows the Angels might be onto something good.
Beginning last Thursday when Ken Hill allowed one run in seven
innings, Angels starters have given up eight runs in 302/3 innings,
a 2.40 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is going to hit,'' Finley said. ``It always seemed
the starters couldn't string anything together. Now it does.''

PETTY TUNES UP FOR MOTORCYCLE TRIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ Kyle Petty finished six miles shy of the full
distance during Sunday's NAPA California 500 at the California
Speedway. That was just a tuneup for the trip he's going to embark
on this morning from Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   For the fifth consecutive year, Petty will lead a motorcycle
caravan cross-country to his home in North Carolina. The Kyle Petty
Charity Ride Across America, sponsored this year by Hot Wheels,
will get under way at 10 a.m. This year's route will cover 2,863
miles and is expected to draw more than 250 riders.
</P>
<P>
   Participants for the week-long ride include members of the
racing Petty family, Richard and grandson Adam and Winston Cup
drivers Steve Park, Kenny Schrader, Joe Nemechek, Geoffrey Bodine
and Robert Pressley.
</P>
<P>
   Petty has raised more than $1 million for various children's
charities and the Winston Cup Racing Wives Auxiliary Trust Fund.
The group will stop along the route to visit several children's
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fun thing to be associated with,'' said Petty. ``I
really enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Sunday's race, Petty finished 26th.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just never ran. We had a good, basic race, we just didn't
run good,'' said Petty, who unveiled a new paint scheme that
featured the charity ride's logo. EARLY EXIT: Johnny Benson didn't
get much time on the track. On the third lap, the driver of the No.
26 Cheerios Ford made contact with the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what happened,'' said Benson. ``It got a little
loose in one, but that was my fault for getting too high and then
it was fine. I went down in turn three and it came around so fast I
don't know if something broke or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty much a junked car.''
</P>
<P>
   AIR CONTROL: It did not seem nearly as crowded on the two-mile
speedway as it did in the airspace above. Nine airplanes towed
various signs over the crowd, while three helicopters hovered in
and around that traffic. The Goodyear blimp, based in Carson, also
made an appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Overcast skies in the morning prevented the crowd from viewing a
pair of F-16 jets from the 144th Fighter Wing at March Air Force
Reserve Base in the traditional fly-by. Major John Cotter called
for two passes, but the jets couldn't get under the cloud cover for
safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The low ceiling also prevented a 30-person skydive.
</P>
<P>
   BONUS MONEY: A total of $55,500 in bonus money was not awarded
on Sunday, including the NASCAR Winston Leader bonus worth $50,000.
If Jeff Gordon, winner of the race, had also led the points he
would have cashed in. Runner up Jeff Burton maintained the points
lead. The remaining $5,500 was dependent on qualifying, which was
rained out on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Burton did cash in on the Gatorade Front Runner Award, worth
$10,000 for leading at the halfway point. Gordon crew chief Ray
Evernham picked up $7,200, which was more than his driver.
Evernham's pit strategy was worth $4,200 and being the winning crew
chief netted him another $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   OVERNIGHT WORK: Long before the first fan arrived at the
speedway on Sunday, speedway maintenance crews had worked long and
hard on painting the walls. According to operations director Ed
Straub, Jr., the crews used 30 gallons of white paint to remove the
various marks made by Busch Grand National and Winston West cars
during their races on Saturday.

STEWART TAKES BIG STEP TOWARD ROOKIE OF THE YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM GAZZOLO  
 Inland Valley Daily Bulletin  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ Despite a foot fault that cost him pain all
day, Tony Stewart kept a leg up on most of the field. Sure, he
showed his rookie status a couple of times Sunday, but by the end
of the California 500 he was the only one who noticed. And he
noticed a lot.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old, who is driving up a storm in his first season
on the Winston Cup circuit, took a huge step toward winning Rookie
of the Year honors. That step, however, landed on two very painful
feet. Stewart forgot to put on his heel pads before the race, only
realizing the mistake when he pulled out of pit row for the parade
lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw them hanging on my mirror,'' he said. ``That was my
fault, no question about it. It started bothering me at about lap
50, but I had a job to do, and I had to hang with it.''
</P>
<P>
   While his feet soaked in ice water, Stewart reflected on a day
of highs and lows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with the way we ran,'' said Stewart. ``I made a lot
of mistakes out there and they showed, but we hung tough. I learned
a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   He finished the race fourth, best of his young career in Winston
Cup. He also made his car owner, Joe Gibbs, happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good day for Tony,'' said Gibbs. ``He fought through
some troubles and made the needed adjustments to finish the race.
He is coming on strong as a driver and learning every week. We
can't ask for much more.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart showed he can survive near-disaster as well. After
starting the race from the seventh spot, he quickly moved up the
field, reaching third once. He was in fourth place when he got
caught in traffic coming out of turn two on lap 147.
</P>
<P>
   Stuck behind Rusty Wallace, among others, he was trying to pass
and nearly lost control of his car. Instead, he avoided spinning
out by hitting the brakes, a move that saw his car begin to slide
and eventually cost him seven positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your heart skips a beat when you start to lose a 3,600-pound
car, that's for sure,'' said Stewart. ``It reminded me of my days
on the dirt tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart recovered, regained his poise and ultimately his
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``That showed what kind of a driver Tony is,'' said Gibbs. ``He
learned from that and was able to get back into the thick of
things.''
</P>
<P>
   The move also impressed his crew chief, Greg Zipadelli.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony has a ton of talent,'' said Zipadelli. ``He is smart and
aggressive. Those things got him out of trouble and kept him
racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fine line between being aggressive and being stupid,
and Tony seems to know where that line is and doesn't cross it.''
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-place finish marked the ninth time in 10 races that
Stewart has been the fastest rookie. It also topped his career-best
Cup showing of fifth, which he set last week at Talladega. Stewart
also improved a spot in the Winston Cup standings, moving from
seventh to sixth. He is trying to become the first rookie since
Jody Ridley (7th) in 1980 to finish in the top 10 in the final
points standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a great showing,'' said Zipadelli. ``I think we
are ahead of schedule. He is still a rookie and still has a lot to
learn, but he is learning quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Just don't tell Stewart how good he is, he doesn't want to hear
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see guys like Jeff Gordon and Jeff Burton out there, and
you see what they do week in and week out. That's where you have
got to go to win consistently out here. You have to be consistent
and that's what we are looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can be happy with the way we raced today. The team did a
great job, but we have a lot more work to do, and we all know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's feet are firmly planted on the ground, but they are
just a little sore right now.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Every now and then, a team just needs to slap around the Clippers.
Having failed to do it then, the Rockets desperately needed to now.
<TEXT>
<P>
   No team might have needed to enjoy itself more. Winning would
not be sufficient. The Rockets needed to run and have fun. It
didn't matter to the Rockets that it was the Clippers. The Rockets
needed to strut again.
</P>
<P>
   So with Charles Barkley and Scottie Pippen forcing the break and
pledging to press the accelerator the rest of the season, the
Rockets ran and laughed to a 110-84 rout of the Los Angeles
Clippers on Sunday night at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   The win could not repair the damage in the standings or to the
ego wrought over the past two weeks. But so desperate were the
Rockets to win, and enjoy themselves after they handled the
Clippers, who were playing out the string in the second game of a
road back-to-back, Pippen declared: ``It was a great win. We needed
a win like this for our confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Barkley said he and Pippen decided to run and
enjoy themselves. They forced tempo from the outset, rarely went to
the usual half-court, low-post game and scored easily. They had the
most prolific first half of the season and finished with a flurry
of 3s. Along the way, they led by as many as 30 points and never in
the second half allowed the Clippers to get closer than 14.
</P>
<P>
   And though their 19 fast-break points were fewer than in recent
wins over the Lakers and SuperSonics, and for that matter their
loss to the Clippers, they seemed more active, aggressive and
confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the mentality we have to have going to the
playoffs,'' Barkley said. ``We just have to build upon that.''
</P>
<P>
   With two regular-season games left, and reeling from losses in
five of their past six games, the Rockets rolled from the outset to
keep pace with the Lakers, 91-84 winners in Seattle on Sunday. The
teams are tied in the race for the fourth seed and home-court
advantage in the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets face Minnesota on Tuesday and are at Denver on
Wednesday. The Lakers, holding the tiebreaker over the Rockets, are
home for Dallas tonight and Portland on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   With the win, the Rockets clinched at least the fifth seed. With
the Rockets' recent slide, until Sunday Phoenix had remained in
range to catch the Rockets for the fifth seed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a much-needed win,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich
said. ``It got us off the schneid and keeps us in the race for the
home-court advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to do the best we can, and somebody has got to help
us. If it (reclaiming the home-court advantage) doesn't happen,
we'll deal with the hand we're dealt and go from there. We've done
that before.''
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways, Sunday's win was not about home-court
advantage or next week. It wasn't even about feeling like a
contender again. The Rockets said they needed to enjoy themselves
on the court, to get get their rookies running and their defense
moving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody enjoyed that game,'' said guard Brent Price, who
came off the bench for 15 points and five assists in 21 minutes.
``We have not played well lately. We had that monkey crawling on
our backs. To go out there and relax, have fun out there and play
some ball, to enjoy that experience, is big. We need to build on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   They seemed to build on it as the game progressed. As if to
demonstrate that they would not rely on the post-up game and
3-point shooting, they ended the third quarter with a run without
posting Barkley or Hakeem Olajuwon (20 points) inside or taking a
3.
</P>
<P>
   Cuttino Mobley scored on an alley-oop inbounds pass from Pippen
to beat the shot clock, then set up Barkley for a layup. Michael
Dickerson had his second dunk in three minutes, before Mobley
scored on two drives and a 22-footer, pushing the lead to a then
game-high 20, 80-60.
</P>
<P>
   But before they would settle for a solid but unspectacular win,
they found the touch outside to turn it into a rout. Leading by 18
after a Pippen 3, the Rockets went three minutes without scoring as
the Clippers moved within 86-72 with eight minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   But in the next four minutes, the Rockets found the range
outside. Pippen, who finished with 14 points, seven rebounds and
seven assists, pulled up for another 3 before Sam Mack, who had
made just one of his first five shots, hit a 3 from the corner and
got on a roll. Price hit a trey, and when Pippen missed on a fast
break, Olajuwon was there to put in the follow.
</P>
<P>
   Price missed a 3, but Pippen grabbed the rebound and hit another
3, his third of the quarter. And when Mack nailed another trey with
2:50 left, the Rockets had a 17-6 run and a 25-point margin.
Leading 103-78, Tomjanovich had his first chance in weeks to clear
his bench with enough time to let them get sweaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The starters have been carrying a lot of heavy minutes. It's
always good when everybody gets the opportunity to get into the
ballgame,'' Pippen said. ``We haven't played great ball over the
last five or six games. We needed to come out strong, take this
team out early, not let them have any confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the Rockets reclaimed enough of their confidence
to put their recent past behind them, even to expect more of the
same when they are not sharing the court with the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty important for us to get out and play with
intensity,'' Rockets forward/center Antoine Carr said. ``That is
something we've been lacking. We need this same type of intensity
until this season is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just felt good to win the way we did. We still have a long
ways to go.''
</P>
<P>
   But they knew though it might have been a small step, they took
it at full speed and in the right direction.

BURTON CONTENT WITH SECOND-PLACE FINISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL HELMS  
 Inland Valley Daily Bulletin  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ It was tough to see Jeff Gordon by the end of
the California 500 Sunday, but Jeff Burton had as good a view as
anybody. And he knew any hopes of catching the winner at the end
were futile.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon won the race for the second time in three years and all
Burton could do was settle for a distant second place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 24 car got out ahead of us a little bit too far,'' Burton
said. ``All you want is to have a chance to win at the end and we
didn't quite get that chance. Once he got half a straightaway in
front of us, we were pretty much done.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton appeared to be closing the gap at the end, but Gordon's
winning margin was still more than four seconds. Burton wondered if
Gordon wasn't just coasting a bit with such a large lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know that he was running as hard as he could run (at
the end),'' Burton said. ``I suspect that he wasn't. All day long
we were pretty much equal to him, and you don't just all of a
sudden, unless they're running poorly, start picking up three or
four tenths a lap. I don't know how we would have been with him.
Our car was good at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton was more than happy to take his second-place finish,
especially considering the way his car ran earlier in the week.
There was no qualifying for Sunday's race because of Friday's
persistent rains, and Burton got the pole because of his standing
in the points race. He considered that a blessing because the
practice laps he took around the track on Saturday were less than
scintillating.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we hadn't been rained out, we probably would have qualified
30th,'' Burton said. ``We didn't like the way the car was running
in practice. We were the third-fastest car, but we weren't the
third-best car by any means. After about 15 laps, our car was
really bad. We had to make huge improvements to the car if we were
going to compete with the 24.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton felt better about his chances once he got out on the
track Sunday. Although he immediately lost the lead to Dale
Jarrett, he was able to run with the leaders all afternoon. He and
Gordon battled fairly evenly in the early stages of the race. The
turning point came when Ricky Rudd hit the wall on lap 133, drawing
a caution flag, and Burton was caught in the pits. By the time he
returned to the track, he was a lap down from the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Gordon, who was also in the pits, was able to get
out just in front of the pace car so he stayed on the same lap.
Burton got the lap back later in the race and was able to quickly
fight his way back into the top five. He eventually ran down Bobby
Labonte for second.
</P>
<P>
   ``To battle back from being a lap down that late in the race and
getting second was pretty good,'' Burton said. ``I got a little bit
loose at the end and couldn't make up enough ground (to catch
Gordon).''
</P>
<P>
   The second-place finish did enable Burton to increase his points
lead over second-place Jarrett to 55 points. Gordon moved up to
fourth, 200 points behind. Third place belongs to Labonte, 154
points behind Burton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burton is hanging in there strong,'' Gordon said. ``He's
running well; that's why they're where they're at.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton, who wound up fifth last year in points with career-highs
in top-five and top-10 finishes, is getting the job done with
consistency. He has finished 11th or better in nine of the 10 races
this year, including a pair of victories. He also recorded his best
finish at California Speedway. He was 10th here last year and 30th
in 1997.

L.A. RABBI MEMBER OF JACKSON DELEGATION TO BELGRADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the Rev. Jesse Jackson tapped religious
leaders for his bold effort to free three American soldiers held
captive in Yugoslavia, Rabbi Steven Jacobs of Woodland Hills was
honored to join the humanitarian mission.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime Jewish leader has traveled abroad to aid Cambodian
and Laotian refugees and Russian refuseniks, but the journey into
the heart of a nation bombed daily by NATO forces was his most
dangerous challenge yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew this was a dangerous mission. They made the choice to
put themselves in harm's way. This was the window of opportunity
that they saw to get these men out,'' said his wife, Linda Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have faith as well and I believed he would be safe, though I
was realistic to know they were in a war zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Mission accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Jacobs and the others in the 19-member interfaith
delegation were returning to the United States on Sunday after
Jackson convinced President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to
release the soldiers a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation left with freed soldiers on a bus to Croatia and
then were flown to a U.S. military base in Ramstein, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud. For someone who has a passion for humanity and
civil rights, this is what it's all about,'' Linda Jacobs said &UR; , &LR; 
after speaking with her husband by phone from the base in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi's involvement was a good omen for the mission, said
Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Woodland Hills, who joined a congressional
delegation to Italy, Albania, Macedonia and Brussels, Belgium over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been involved in the moral issues of our country,''
Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly the U.S. position that these soldiers were
held immorally and illegally,'' Sherman noted. ``Having a
delegation made up of people who are known for their human rights
was important to the successful mission.''
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi and the reverend have joined for a variety of
interfaith efforts over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, rabbi of Kol Tikvah, a Reform congregation, attracted
Jackson's attention with his efforts to create new bonds between
Jewish and African-American congregations. Jackson spoke at the San
Fernando Valley Interfaith Council celebration of Martin Luther
King Jr.'s birthday last year.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Jacobs and Jackson laid a wreath for three civil
rights workers who were slain near Philadelphia, Miss., in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the call to join the mission to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very excited about it and really wanted to be part of
this because he believed a humanitarian approach might be a way to
get these men home,'' Linda Jacobs recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in Yugoslavia on Wednesday, the delegation met with the
Yugoslavian foreign minister and a Yugoslav interfaith clergy
group.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and his delegation met with the three soldiers Friday in
Belgrade. Rabbi Jacobs told his wife they appeared generally
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   But gaining their release was far from certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was always a chance that they would leave
empty-handed,'' Linda Jacobs noted. ``They did have some
frustrating moments.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubts were raised after Milosevic told Jackson after their
first meeting that he would speak to his government officials. But
the two met again and Milosevic committed to the soldiers' release.
</P>
<P>
   The families of the three U.S. servicemen, including Staff Sgt.
Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles, were headed to Germany for
reunions on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek,
Mich., and Spc. Steven M. Gonzales, 22, of Huntsville, Texas, were
taken captive March 31 while patrolling the Yugoslav-Macedonia
border as part of a peacekeeping mission.

TOP PICK HURTS LEFT SHOULDER

   Tempe, Ariz. - Cardinals first-round draft pick David Boston
suffered a fractured bone in his left shoulder less than 30 minutes
from the end of the final workout in a three-day minicamp on Sunday
and will be unable to work out for at least one month.
</P>
<P>
   ``No surgery is required,'' said Russell Chick, the Cardinals
orthopedic surgeon, who made the diagnosis after Boston was x-rayed
in the training room. ``Treatment will be immobilization in a sling
for four to six weeks. After that, he should be 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The fracture is to the scapula, or wing bone, on the back of the
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, who in three years broke nearly every pass-receiving
record at Ohio State before the Cardinals made him the eighth
player chosen in last month's draft, emerged from the training room
and refused to talk to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The injury was suffered when cornerback Corey Chavous collided
with Boston while Boston, who is not yet under contract, was
attempting to catch a pass in the no-pads workout at the team's
training facility in Tempe. The blow from the collision knocked
Boston to the ground. He landed on the back of his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scapula is part of the structure of the shoulder that
elevates and moves the shoulder,'' Chick said. ``There are a lot of
muscles attached to it. It's not near the shoulder joint, which
means it should heal quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``David cannot lift his arm above his shoulder at this point.
It's too painful.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, medical personnel thought the injury was only a
bruise. Chick said that Boston told him that he had ``had this
maybe 50 times before.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was learned that the injury was more serious, the
Cardinals' reactions ranged from disbelief to anger that Boston,
whose speed is expected to stretch opposing defenses and make the
Cardinals offense more explosive, had flirted with disaster at the
hands of a teammate in a no-pads drill.
</P>
<P>
   Minicamps are conducted primarily as off-season vehicles for
training and implementation of systems. By league rules, the only
protective gear permissible is a helmet. Some coaches have
circumvented the rules in the past by allowing shoulder pads to be
worn. They have been fined by the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having something like this happen is the line you walk when
you have a minicamp,'' said Bob Ferguson, the Cardinals new general
manager. ``Players get carried away in the spirit of competition.
You've got to be careful. You want them going full speed in these
drills, but you've got to be mindful that you're without pads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unintentional, obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavous and Boston shook hands and talked for several minutes
afterward in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh man, never in a million years did I think something like
this could happen on the last day of minicamp,'' Chavous said. ``I
really hope he's going to be OK. I was just sick. You don't want
anybody getting hurt in minicamp, especially someone who means as
much to our future as David does.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's an athlete, I'm an athlete, and we were going for the
ball, competing.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Jake Plummer, who threw the pass, said his heart
also sank when he saw Boston land hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``A quarterback can't stand to watch a defensive back throw a
receiver down,'' Plummer said. ``It was not Corey's fault. If it
had been on purpose, like he was trying to teach a rookie a lesson,
that would be B.S. But he was playing ball, and that's just the way
things go. I know David will be all right, but I know ownership
doesn't want to watch David Boston limp off.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Coach Vince Tobin was led to believe it was no more
than a bruise.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after getting the bad news, an obviously angry Tobin
refused further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Chick said that Boston will not run until the fracture begins to
unite. Boston will be limited in the team's two-week rookie and
free-agent camp in Tempe next month but should be fully healed for
the start of training camp in Flagstaff at the end of July.

VICTORY GOES TO THE FLEET

   BOSTON _ Au revoir, sayonara, see ya later, goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins bid farewell to the valiant Carolina Hurricanes
Sunday night, knocking them out in six games and the 2-0 victory,
their third in a row, was punctuated by goalie Byron Dafoe's second
shutout of the series (No. 3 of his playoff career) and his first
postseason series win.
</P>
<P>
   The victory in the Eastern Conference quarterfinal series was
Boston's first in a series since defeating Montreal in seven games
back in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Now the team must wait to find out its opponent for the
conference semifinals. Boston would face seventh-seeded Buffalo if
Pittsburgh knocks off New Jersey in Game 7 Tuesday night. If New
Jersey wins, Boston will face fourth-seeded Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns said he was grateful the series was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lost, a Game 7 would've been very, very difficult for us
to win there,'' said Burns. ``I didn't tell (the players) that. But
you didn't want to go back for a Game 7.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that it's over, Burns said they haven't won anything. Nobody
is satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't accomplished nothing yet,'' he said. ``You get
greedy, that's what happens. We're greedy right now. We've got one
step, anything's possible. It's a step for the young players that
they really learned what it takes to get this far. Now we have to
try to teach them to get one more step further.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolina was a game and difficult opponent throughout, including
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night. The Bruins got on the board midway through the first
on Joe Thornton's first goal of the postseason. With Boston on the
power play, Jason Allison dished the puck between the legs of
defenseman Curtis Leschyshyn to right wing Dmitri Khristich.
Khristich relayed it to Thornton, who slid his shot past goalie
Arturs Irbe at 8:58. It was just Boston's third shot of the game.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of heavy hitting in the period with the best
one coming from one former teammate to another. Defenseman Don
Sweeney knocked the stuffing out of Carolina rearguard Glen Wesley,
a former Bruin, at the Boston blue line during a Hurricanes power
play.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Kyle McLaren also rattled some bones when he drilled
Robert Kron in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   The wild second period was, depending on what team you were
rooting for, a comedy of errors for Carolina or some wonderful luck
for Boston. The Hurricanes missed a boatload of scoring chances and
the Bruins managed to build on their lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes thought they had tied it at 2:10 when Bates
Battaglia fired a pass to Kron. Kron, driving toward the right
post, had the entire net to shoot at but couldn't control the pass.
Battaglia went so far as to raise his arm in celebration only to
realize the pass didn't translate into a goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes had another scoring opportunity at 7:29 when Gary
Roberts got to a rebound but missed the empty net. Kent Manderville
also had a good one from the left circle but he couldn't cash in
and that immediately preceded the second Boston goal. Mattias
Timander chipped the puck out of the Boston zone and Anson Carter,
the hero of Game 5, skated it up the ice, through the neutral zone,
and gained the blue line. He threw it over to Steve Heinze in the
left circle and Heinze backhanded it right back, with Carter
beating Irbe from right in front at 8:13 for the 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The second half of the second period belonged to Carolina, which
began putting heavy heat on the Bruins in their own end and outshot
them by a whopping 16-3 in the period. But Dafoe, as he's done all
season long, held the fort.
</P>
<P>
   ``They missed a lot of open nets that could've really changed it
around,'' said Burns. ``The third period was probably the best
third period we played in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe said he considered himself very fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made some saves when I had to,'' he said. ``But I also had a
couple of empty nets and they put some plexiglass up or something.
I don't know what happened. Obviously with them not getting a goal
and us going into the third period up, 2-0, I liked our chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolina's Keith Primeau said Dafoe was the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we have any more chances in this locker
room,'' he said. ``But he turned us down time and time again. It
was just that Byron Dafoe played out of his mind.''

SUNS LOSE GAMBLE WITH SLOPPY PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ The Suns are thinking about first-round playoff
opponents. San Antonio? Portland? Utah? It's roulette. Round and
round it goes.
</P>
<P>
   The spinning array of NBA possibilities will stop on one of the
three this week. On Wednesday, the Suns will know their first foe.
On Sunday, they simply knew they were lucky. Even in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The Sacramento Kings won't be there. If they were, this game of
roulette might be deadly. The Suns simply had no chance against the
Kings this season.
</P>
<P>
   That point was hammered home with a 111-100 victory over the
Suns that gave the Kings a sweep of the regular-season series
between the Pacific Division teams: three Sacramento victories by a
average margin of 13.3 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns struck out in any and every attempt to derail the
entertaining whirlwind of an attack launched by an improbable team
that is one game from clinching a playoff spot for only the third
time since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any team that says, `Oh good, we get to
play Sacramento,' '' said Suns Coach Danny Ainge, whose club nailed
down a playoff spot Saturday in a victory over Vancouver. ``I feel
the same way about us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Utah, Portland or San Antonio are really looking
forward to one team or another. I think there is a lot of parity
out there. The Kings have a chance, and I think everybody knows
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns' chances to avoid the sweep in the series finale before
a lively crowd at ARCO Arena were limited by their own plans.
Before tip-off, Ainge planned on cutting the minutes for his key
players.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kidd is the league leader in average playing time. On this
night, he played only 36 minutes. In the second half, he sat for
seven minutes, a stretch during which the Kings gained control.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gugliotta didn't play at all in the fourth quarter. In part,
Ainge rested him because he still is troubled by a bruise to his
right calf. Gugliotta hit a jumper for two of his 21 points with
4:31 left in the third quarter. The 17-foot shot tied the score at
71. He left the game for good 1 minute, 22 seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Kings had pushed their advantage to six. They would
never look back, as they raced to a lead that grew to 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the substitution pattern coach had planned on,''
Gugliotta said. ``It's no big deal. I accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kidd sounded almost relieved at the diminished time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach told us before tip-off that we were going to have
limited minutes,'' said Kidd, who narrowly missed another
triple-double with 15 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds. ``We
clinched a playoff spot. That's what we wanted to take care of. Now
the key is to make sure everybody is rested.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Kings, there would be no such luxury. They are still
battling for one of the Western Conference's two remaining playoff
spots. There is a sense of urgency in Sacramento, and it was
evident with repeated bursts of energy, especially from rookie
playmaker Jason Williams and veteran forward Chris Webber.
</P>
<P>
   Williams finished with 24 points. For every Suns threat, he had
a counter. Midway through the fourth quarter, Suns forward Clifford
Robinson cut the Kings' margin to seven with a three-point goal.
Williams followed with one of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Webber. He played despite back spasms that forced
him to the locker room in the first half. He also was saddled with
foul trouble. The NBA's rebounding leader was charged with his
third in the first half. Yet, he managed 13 points and 13 rebounds
in only 32 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite it all, the Suns still had chances. In the end, they
only had to look at the box score for the reason they lost. Twenty
total turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The turnovers were no reason to panic. Still, they sounded an
alarm. They are a sign of sloppiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we came out with a lot of the passion and energy
that we have been playing with,'' Ainge said. ``But then, I saw the
intensity and concentration level fade in the second quarter. We
were in and out for the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a little scary.''

BRUINS' EFFORT REALLY SOMETHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Five years later, the Hub got its hockey team back
Sunday night. The Bruins found their game. They won a playoff
series. Monday morning they are one-quarter of the way to the
Stanley Cup _ talk about your unbridled optimism _ and the truth
is, that doesn't really matter.
</P>
<P>
   What matters? Just that they can look in the newspapers, watch
the sportscasts, most importantly look in the mirror and finally
say they've won something. They aren't just a bunch of whoevers and
wannabes dressed in Black 'n Gold uniforms. They've got an
identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a while,'' said Steve Heinze, one of the veterans
who was in uniform when the Bruins won their first-round series in
'94, back in the Planet Iafrate era. ``Something like this brings
you together when you know you can do something this good.''
</P>
<P>
   From here, who knows? The Bruins will face either Toronto or
Buffalo in Round 2. Neither of those clubs will bang away and
barrel in on the forecheck the way Carolina did, but both can
finish better around the net and both have superb goalies.
</P>
<P>
   But all of that's for later in the week. The Bruins can look
back at a first-round triumph in which they trailed, 2-1, and
rattled off three straight wins. Once they figured out that the
Carolina offense consisted of: 1. A dump in the corner; 2. A pass
behind the net; and 3. A centering pass from behind the post, they
all but punched their ticket to Round 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were making a lot of flip dumps,'' said Boston netminder
Byron Dafoe, who picked up a pair of shutouts in the six-game
series. ``I told our guys, `Look, I can get out there and handle
the puck, if you can hold them up on the way in.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Voila. If only every playoff series were so simple to fathom and
then unfold. There was more to getting by the 'Canes than that, of
course, and one of the key elements was luck.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not forget OT in Greensboro Friday night when Martin
Gelinas was left staring at 24 square feet of open net as he stood
at the top of the crease. Gelinas didn't blink, but he swung and
hit the puck twice, a double hit that would be tantamount to
striking out twice on the same at-bat in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, old friend Glen Wesley rang a potential winner off
the crossbar (at least his shots are getting lower).
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins haven't won a Stanley Cup since '72, and in that
quarter century-plus drought they've had more than their fair share
of bad breaks, both regular season and postseason. Thus far in the
spring of '99, they have fate patting them on the back instead of
slamming down on their toes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got some bounces here in the last couple of games,'' said
Ray Bourque, the aging captain, who totaled nearly an hour of ice
time in the Game 5 double-OT victory. ``That's what you need to
move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe did his usually reliable job in the series. Bourque, the
other given, did everything that was expected of him, and a little
bit more (isn't that what's really expected of him, too?). They got
a huge series from Anson Carter, who popped in the second goal
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night with an eye-popping dash down the slot. And their
ever-reliable checking line of Rob DiMaio, Tim Taylor, and P.J.
Axelsson more than stood up to the ferocious 'Canes charge that was
led by behemoth Keith Primeau. All of that, with some luck mixed
in, defeated the 'Canes.
</P>
<P>
   If they're going to get to Round 3, though, the Bruins are going
to have to step up their offensive attack. Dmitri Khristich, who
had one shot in the first three games, got slightly better in the
next three games. He still isn't the guy who popped in a team-high
29 goals from October to April. Jason Allison and Sergei Samsonov,
his other linemates, also have to be more involved in the offense.
Allison had some prime opportunities, but kept hitting Arturs Irbe
in the chest as if there were extra points to be had for hitting
some invisible bull's-eye. To keep the good times rolling around
here, the No. 1 trio has to play like a legitimate first-line
force.
</P>
<P>
   The first round, essentially a postseason qualifier, allows a
team to move on when not all the parts are working. The Bruins have
yet to find their `A' game.
</P>
<P>
   But they have found their team, their confidence, their
self-respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what we have in here, I think we've always known
that,'' said DiMaio. ``Now, the further you go, everything gets
intensified, the attention, everything. We always felt like a team.
Now we're winning, and the goals just expand.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo is saying the same thing. Toronto, too. There will be a
Stanley Cup parade somewhere in late June and by Tuesday night
we'll know the eight teams that are still vying for that raucous
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the Bruins twice drew monstrous crowds downtown when they
won the Cup in '70 and '72. Those were the days of Bobby Orr and
Phil Esposito, of Gerry Cheevers and John Bucyk. If not for Ken
Dryden, there might have been three consecutive parades. It looked
like the parties and the celebrations would last forever.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing lasts forever, of course. But Sunday &UR;  &LR; night a little of
that feeling came back. Hockey has come back to the Hub.

CLOCK RUNS OUT  
 FINAL DRIVE TAKES ELWAY OUT OF FOOT BALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ John Elway already has found out that retirement can be
costly.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Saturday) night, John went down to have dinner with several
of his teammates,'' Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen said. ``There
was a no-parking sign that said nobody can park there except
(maybe) John Elway. They towed his car .
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't get a cab. So he had to walk three miles through
an industrial area to get his car. The lady said, `That will be
$100.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So, John, welcome to being a retired quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Elway, the only NFL player ever to start five Super
Bowls, officially retired after 16 seasons. Recovering his car was
easier than getting through his retirement speech.
</P>
<P>
   Not even humor could keep him from breaking down several times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys told me (Saturday) night, there was an over-and-under
(bet) in the locker room how many times I'm going to cry,'' Elway
said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, his wife, Janet, needed to bring him a bottle of
water and Kleenex. The tears still flowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the line is, but I lost my bet,'' Elway
said.
</P>
<P>
   He was flanked by Bowlen, who called him ``the greatest to ever
play the game,'' and Coach Mike Shanahan, Elway's close friend and
mentor.
</P>
<P>
   All of his family was in the audience. Many of his current and
former teammates also attended.
</P>
<P>
   `'I've learned so much from John _ how to handle the locker
room, the media, when to shut up,'' tight end Shannon Sharpe said.
``The guy has been Mr. Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of the players who placed the (over) bet on how many
times he'd cry. You can't go 16 years and all of sudden not do that
anymore without being emotional. There's not an over-40 or over-50
league for him to play. He was saying today that the last time you
saw me play football was in the Super Bowl, and it was hard for
him. I knew (the tears) would happen. That's why I bet and won.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway, 38, goes out on top. The Broncos have won back-to-back
Super Bowls, and he was selected the Most Valuable Player in last
January's victory over Atlanta in Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   He said he made his decision to retire in early April after
consulting his wife and his father, Jack Elway, Broncos director of
pro scouting who told him that he was getting ``prone to
injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway has a deteriorating left knee that hurts so badly he can't
walk 18 holes of golf, and the knee will eventually have to be
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never want to stop competing, but I can't compete at the
level I want to compete anymore,'' said Elway, whose 51,475 passing
yards trail only Dan Marino in NFL history. ``The second reason
came down to my family. They've been great for 16 years. It's time
I focus around them.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that trying to help the Broncos become the first
team to win three consecutive Super Bowls was intriguing. But he
said before last season that he was 99 percent sure it would be his
last, and he never really wavered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chance for a three-peat seemed great, but I just wanted to
give myself a chance to think about it,'' he said. ``The only way I
could do that was to get away. When it was time to get ready for
the off-season program, I needed to see where my head was. About
the time the program was ready to begin (April 5), I said, `I can't
do it anymore.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Elway said Shanahan had ``left the door open'' for him to return
on almost any terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You can play half a season. We'll make sure you're
healthy. If you're not healthy, you don't play,' '' Elway said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Mike, that's not me. I'm all in or all out.'
</P>
<P>
   ``There will have to be a 100 percent, total catastrophe for me
to come back. If Mike came to me and said, `The only guy who can
take a snap is (guard) Mark Schlereth.' Other than that, I'm
done.''

   Elway doesn't know how he will spend his retirement. He's
interested in Bowlen's standing offer to become a minority owner of
the team, but the two haven't discussed specifics. He confirmed
that he has some national broadcast opportunities, including being
part of ABC's ``Monday Night Football'' team, but said he was ``not
overly excited about it because of the time commitment away from my
family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just know I'm going to be the biggest fan of the Denver
Broncos of all time, and they're going to continue to win,'' Elway
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan said he would remember Elway as an intense competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what you did, he had to beat you,'' Shanahan said.
``If you did beat him, he had to play you until he won.''
</P>
<P>
   He also will remember Elway for his generosity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Shanahan, a San Francisco assistant at the time,
interviewed for the Broncos head coaching job but didn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``John said, `What's the problem?' '' Shanahan said. ``I said,
`It's more salary than anything else.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I embellished the story a little bit and said there was a
difference of about $200,000 a year on a three- or four-year
contract. He said, `That's done. I'll take care of that.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him there also were some perks involved. He said, `I'll
give you four cars, one for each of your family.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Elway was known for his great comebacks. In fact, he
led the Broncos to 47 come-from-behind victories. ``I wonder how we
got in that situation so many times,'' Elway said. ``But (the
comebacks) sort of tells you what I'm all about.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also had been known for embarrassing Super Bowl losses.
The Broncos were outscored by a combined 96 points in Elway's first
three Super Bowl games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances are if we hadn't won that Super Bowl (XXXII), I'd
be back playing right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he'd miss the huddle and telling Sharpe ``to be quiet. I
know you're open. I know you're open. I know you're open.''
</P>
<P>
   He also knows not to ignore any more parking signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It said, `No Parking. Postal Customers Only.' I said, `This
must be OK,' '' Elway said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look up and think, `Oh, no. The car's gone.' I start
walking. I think I'll run into a cab. I run into six limos of high
school students going to a prom. They drive by and point at me.''

MANN GETS CHANCE TO MINE FOR GOALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The morning practice was over, only Shawn Bates and
Cameron Mann left behind for what amounted to on-ice skeet
shooting. Assistant coach Jacques Laperriere stood in one circle
and shuttled pass after pass to the opposite side, Bates and Mann
taking turns cocking back their sticks and leveling blazing
slappers at an open net.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting is only half the drill. Knowing when to shoot, what to
look for, is equally important. ``You've got to read off the
defenseman if you're in a one-on-one situation,'' Mann said. ``Cut
to the middle, take what he gives you and hit it _ ideally use the
defenseman as a screen.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the theory, anyway, and until Sunday &UR;  &LR; night Mann had
only theory to dwell on in Boston's first-round series against the
'Canes. He wasn't asked to suit up in the first five games, coach
Pat Burns electing to go with a more seasoned lineup against the
older Carolina club.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday night, with the Bruins facing the chance to clinch
their first postseason series since '94, Burns told Mann to pull on
a sweater and join the show. It was Mann's first Stanley Cup game,
the first postseason match of his professional career. He made two
appearances in Sunday &UR;  &LR; night's victory for a total of 1 minute 48
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Just as timing is important when pulling back and teeing up a
slapper, it can be key, too, elsewhere in life. Warren Mann came to
town two weeks ago in hopes of seeing his son wear the black and
gold in a playoff game. His ticket home to northern Ontario was
punched in advance, and he was on a 6 p.m. flight out of Logan,
some 90 minutes before Mann suited up to face the 'Canes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' said Mann. ``He wanted to be here, but he's got
to be home for work.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior Mann lives a black and gold life, too. He's a
supervisor in a gold mine in Cochenour, Ont., some 1,500 miles
north of Toronto. He spends his shift, 6 p.m. to 4 a.m., some 26
levels below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taken me down there with him a couple of times,'' said
Mann. ``If you're claustrophobic, it's probably not something you
want to do. But it didn't bother me. It's actually really something
to see. If they hit a sleeve (of gold), everyone gets pretty
excited and comes running to see it. Most of the time, you can't
even tell there's gold. They have their ways of getting it out of
the rock. But when they hit that big sleeve, you can see it, touch
it _ it's actually kind of soft _ and the guys get going.''
</P>
<P>
   In case you're wondering, there are no free samples in the gold
mining business. When the shift is over, workers file through
security and are checked by what Mann described as a metal
detector. If you're caught trying to take the job home, in all
likelihood you'll be told to stay home for good.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron Mann, who turned 22 last month, is one of Warren and
Darlene Mann's three sons. Dallas, two years older than Cam, played
briefly for Binghamton last season in the United Hockey League, but
had his season shortened by a knee injury. Shane, two years younger
than Cam, is back home in mining country.
</P>
<P>
   The mining life often pulls generations of a family into the
tunnel. It can be a grueling existence. Cameron never wanted to
follow in his dad's footsteps, because he had it in his head at an
early age that he'd rather look for gold in an ice rink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about it a lot, how lucky I am to play a game like
hockey to make a living,'' he said. ``I mean, it's a game, it's
fun, and when you've grown up to see people work the mines, well,
you definitely respect people who work 8 to 5.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann's father wasn't always a miner. The family moved from
Manitoba to Saskatchewan and then eventually to Ontario as Warren
looked for work. He labored for years in grain elevators before
finding work underground as a means of supporting his family.
Darlene Mann augmented the family funds by giving piano lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had her own piano, until my dad had an accident,''
recalled Mann. ``It was one of our moves _ I can't remember which,
because I was young _ and my dad fell asleep, or something, and
cracked up the U-Haul. The piano was ruined. Like I say, a long
time ago, but he hasn't lived that down.''
</P>
<P>
   Darlene Mann was in Winnipeg Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, awaiting her
husband's arrival on the flight from Logan. The drive back to
Cochenour, Cam figured, would take about four hours. By 6 p.m.
Monday, Warren Mann will be back supervising his shift, looking for
the earth to give up its treasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's worked hard for me to play hockey . . . he's worked hard
for all his sons to have a good life,'' said Mann. ``I always knew
what I wanted to do and my dad always encouraged me to follow my
dream.''

SCHOENFELD ON A LIMB AFTER BLUES TIE SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Was it the act of a desperate man, or a case of a
blind optimist whistling past the graveyard?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it was, Coyotes Coach Jim Schoenfeld raised a lot of
eyebrows with some bold words Sunday after the St. Louis Blues
evened the best-of-seven Western Conference playoff series at three
games each with a 5-3 win.
</P>
<P>
   It means the Coyotes, having squandered a 3-1 series lead, will
return to America West Arena on Tuesday night for Game 7 wearing
the forlorn look of distant cousin Wile E. Coyote moments before
another boulder crushes his melon.
</P>
<P>
   But Schoenfeld tried to paint a different picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to win Game 7,'' he said. ``Both teams have played
extremely well, and it probably should come down to seven (games),
if justice is served.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would tell you I would stake my job on it, but that's
already been done, so I'll just say we're going to win Game 7.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld was referring to speculation that his job is history
if the Coyotes don't reach the second round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can say it, it doesn't matter,'' Blues defensemen Al
MacInnis said, reflecting the mood in the Blues' locker room.
``We're not concerned about what they say or do. We're just going
about our own business and try to win one more game.''
</P>
<P>
   At least the Coyotes are now in a situation where the home-ice
advantage won over 82 regular-season games can pay dividends,
although it hasn't meant much in this series. Each team now has two
road wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter now what happened in the first six games. It
doesn't matter,'' Coyotes captain Keith Tkachuk said. ``It comes
down to one game. It doesn't matter if they won eight games in a
row. Just one game for 60 minutes. We'll find out if home-ice
advantage means anything on Tuesday night.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a series of words and wild momentum shifts. In the
past two games, too many words from the Coyotes about closing the
series and not enough action. If ever there was a day when Blues
goalie Grant Fuhr was beatable, it was Sunday. He surrendered three
goals on a paltry 21 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix goalie Nikolai Khabibulin faced 34 shots and saw enough
odd-man rushes to think he was facing the ``Charge of The Light
Brigade''.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost a lot of battles down low,'' Schoenfeld said. ``They
established a much stronger forecheck. That has been a concern the
last few games, with the people we have out of the lineup, to
sustain some kind of offensive pressure, which does two things for
us.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates scoring chances and gives our defensemen a
breather. The last few games, we've spent far too much time in our
defensive zone, which isn't the strength of our defense. Our
defense is at its best when we are moving the puck and breaking
plays up the neutral zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes were without forwards Greg Adams, who has a groin
injury, and penalty killer Mike Sullivan, neither of whom are
expected to play Tuesday night, causing Schoenfeld to shake up his
lines.
</P>
<P>
   He moved Rick Tocchet and Robert Reichel to the No. 1 line with
Tkachuk and started a second line of Dallas Drake, Shane Doan and
Stephen Leach. The two lines had one shot between them in the first
period, causing Schoenfeld to reconfigure them again in a search
for offense.
</P>
<P>
   If ever a team should have entered a game with a sense of
urgency, it was Phoenix. Yet it didn't. Fourth-line center Mike
Stapleton even gave the Coyotes a 1-0 lead at 2:20 of the first
period. Instead of increasing the tempo, they fell back on their
haunches, stopped forechecking and allowed Craig Conroy to score
the first of his two goals to knot the game at one just 36 seconds
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain it,'' Stapleton said of the lack of
first-period emotion. ``It's just like we're not getting momentum
going. It's like we're playing content when we shouldn't be. A
sense of urgency? We didn't play like it. We should have but
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Phoenix play smart, twice throwing away power-play
opportunities in the first period by taking silly penalties _ 35
seconds into one, and 32 seconds into another.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues, however, chose to cash in their power plays, which
they have done with regularity in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Young put St. Louis up, 2-1, at 8:25 on a first-period
power play, and Chris Pronger erased an improbable 3-2 Phoenix lead
with a power-play goal with three-minutes left in the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   Improbable lead?
</P>
<P>
   Considering that the Coyotes took only three shots on goal in
the entire second period, very improbable. Somehow, they managed to
score two goals in 93 seconds, one by Leach and one on a power-play
goal by defenseman Teppo Numminen.
</P>
<P>
   But it was former Coyote Jeff Finley who stuck the dagger into
the Coyotes' heart, taking Pierre Turgeon's centering pass in the
slot and ripping it past Khabibulin at 8:59 of the third. Conroy
completed the scoring, driving home the second rebound on a
three-on-one rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had too many turnovers in our own end and gave them
three-on-ones, three-on-twos,'' Phoenix's Dallas Drake said. ``You
can't do that against them. The penalties we took tonight were not
aggressive penalties. They were stupid penalties.'' &QL;

GORDON LIKES FONTANA TRACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ So, is Jeff Gordon the king of California
Speedway?
</P>
<P>
   One would think that after the three-time NASCAR Winston Cup
champion won here for the second time in the three-year history of
the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's victory, seen my an estimated 117,000, was Gordon's
third top 5 victory in Fontana. Beside winning Sunday and the
inaugural event in 1997, he finished fourth last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy Penske tracks,'' Gordon said. ``California, Michigan
... we seem to run well. Maybe our Michigan package kind of helps
us here. This track is similar to Michigan. It's a beautiful
facility and an awesome place to run a race. We're excited about
coming here. It's my home state and I get a lot of fans out here
and that helps my motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was one of several laps to praise the three-year
facility, which seems to be developing a wider racing groove.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great track,'' said Bobby Labonte, who finished
third. ``I don't think I ran many laps on the same line over and
over. I was outside and inside. The groove moved way up during the
race. It really made for good racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Bodine's bad luck continued Sunday. Bodine, whose had
several good runs during the first part of the season, was running
up front before engine problems dropped him to 37th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something broke,'' Bodine said. ``We came from a long way
back. I'm proud of the crew. This is a new team and our first time
here with a Chevrolet and the first time here with this team. To be
competitive, you can't feel anything but good.''

BLOWN CHANCES FOR HURRICANES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Perhaps they feared that the FleetCenter Jumbotron
would fall on their heads. Perhaps they were suffering a lingering
hangover from the bewildering near misses two nights earlier.
Perhaps they had all come down with hockey's equivalent of the
yips.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the fans who showered the ice with
black-and-gold pompoms at the end of Sunday night's game came
closer to hitting the empty net than did the Carolina Hurricanes.
And that's why the end of the game also marked the end of the
series and the season for the Hurricanes, who dropped a 2-0
decision to the Bruins but were darned if they knew how.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a series that tight-checking, you can't miss those
chances,'' said Carolina coach Paul Maurice, whose team bowed out
of the best-of-seven Eastern Conference quarterfinal in six
nail-biting games. ``Those weren't empty nets, those were line
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   If Maurice's metaphor was confounding, so were the platinum
opportunities that escaped the Hurricanes in their futile battle
for survival. Byron Dafoe was unyielding in the Boston net, but he
wasn't the only reason the Hurricanes outshot the Bruins, 31-21,
including 16-3 in the second period, and had nothing to show for
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt for the first time in six games he gave up some big
rebounds,'' said Carolina's thunderbolt center, Keith Primeau, who
must think his last name is ``Sucks'' after three games of
incessant serenading by the Boston fans. ``We couldn't put 'em in.
I can't even count the number of solid chances we had.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, he could think of a couple in particular.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:47 of a scoreless game in the first period, Primeau walked
out of the corner and sent a shot that caromed off Dafoe's pads.
Then the black magic started. With the net as empty as the
Hurricanes' fortunes, Primeau fired a rebound _ and watched it
glance off defenseman Kyle McLaren's skate. Carolina defenseman
Glen Wesley then flashed into the play, corraling a second rebound
_ and watching in horror as Dafoe knocked it wide by the width of
his skate blade.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it just kept going from there,'' said Primeau.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, less than three minutes later, Primeau was primed to
answer a goal by Boston's Joe Thornton when he set up dead in front
of Dafoe _ and missed.
</P>
<P>
   It got worse in the second period even as Carolina besieged
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:32, Robert Kron was stationed just to the right of the
crease, salivating to cash in a pass. But he was perhaps a step too
deep and mishit the puck.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:30, Sami Kapanen slammed a slap shot from the left that
kicked off Dafoe's pads and rebounded to onrushing Gary Roberts on
the right. The onetime 50-goal scorer launched his bid into the
ozone.
</P>
<P>
   And at 9:25, desperate after Boston built the lead to two goals,
Ray Sheppard drilled a shot from the right that glanced off Dafoe's
pads to Glen Wesley, who misfired from the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had chances in the second and couldn't capitalize,''
lamented Wesley. ``I don't believe they're the better team. We're
evenly matched. They cashed in on their opportunities and we
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Burns would second that. ``Byron made some big saves and
they missed a lot of open nets,'' said the Bruins coach. ``Things
could've swung either way easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurice felt as if he were swinging from a noose as he watched
the gallery of unscathed targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even think you can put them in the missed-opportunity
category,'' he said. ``It's not like Dafoe was pulling shots out of
the air on three-on-twos. When I'm standing on the bench and I can
see both posts and there's no goalie between them, that's what I'm
talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Hurricanes merely were performing a variation on
the theme that killed them at Greensboro Friday, when Wesley hit
the crossbar and Martin Gelinas's wide-open bid in front struck
either Ray Bourque's stick or a gremlin, enabling Boston to escape
with a 4-3 victory. But Carolina wasn't subscribing to the theory
of cursed karma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was a carryover,'' said Primeau, whose
fortune was so wretched that he satisfied the fans' bloodlust by
getting cut in the lip for stitches _ by a teammate. ``It would
have been one thing if we'd been trying to carry the puck through
the neutral zone. But we were right on them and had the chances
right in front.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's any consolation, at least Maurice doesn't have to
scramble for an introductory theme next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to work on it from day one in training camp,'' he
said. ``We're going to leave the goalies in the locker room and
practice hitting empty nets.''

COACH'S GUARANTEE A DIVERSION

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS - The words were almost comical, received with a
collective shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, you can rest easy. The Coyotes coach has
guaranteed a victory in Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would stake my job on it,'' Jim Schoenfeld said. ``But
that's already been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are no guarantees in life, much less in sports.
So what to make of Schoenfeld's voluntary stroll to the edge of the
ledge?
</P>
<P>
   You might call it a sign of panic. After all, a man who is
convinced he's going to win doesn't need to tell the world about
it. Or you might call it confirmation, that regardless of player
testimonials, Schoenfeld knows he is gone if the Coyotes don't
advance.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can call it what it really is: A calculated diversion, an
attempt to take all the focus off his beleaguered hockey team.
Because, in the wake of a 5-3 thumping from the Blues on Sunday,
there is a grim reality beginning to surface.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes are undermanned. And maybe they're just not good
enough to win this series.
</P>
<P>
   It's not daring if you have nothing to lose, but Schoenfeld's
remarks did the trick. The moment the guarantee left his lips,
every media type in the building had swallowed the hook, off with a
sucker's story, off on a frenzied journey for reaction.
</P>
<P>
   In the Coyotes' corner, stoic faces backed their coach. In the
Blues' dressing room, the words carried the ring of a cheap
gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no guarantees, I'll guarantee that,'' Craig Conroy
said. ``But we've put ourselves in a perfect spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Words that made Chris Pronger smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he's in trouble if they don't (win),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Words that bounced off Grant Fuhr like a weak backhand, a man so
worried that he's wondering whether he'll get a chance to golf with
Valley resident and traitor Phil Mickelson in the next couple of
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good for them,'' Fuhr said. ``But we've got 25 guys in here
that don't think that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, these things work out. Joe Namath and Mark Messier
made good on their guarantees, but they were in a position to
influence the outcome. Jimmy Johnson once put his neck on the line
and came off as a prophet. But most of the time, a guarantee from a
coach means less than nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the last time a coach in our parts guaranteed a
victory, Danny Ainge predicted the Suns would rally from an 0-1
deficit last year against the Spurs. He ended up with a plateful of
crow.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld could look like a genius. Or he might resemble the
village idiot. But if his future is predetermined, this is a
no-lose proposition.
</P>
<P>
   But don't think for a moment that his boast has infuriated the
Blues, so much that it will throw them off their game. They have
seized the series, and they know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can say it, it doesn't matter,'' Al MacInnis said. ``We're
not concerned about what they say or do.''
</P>
<P>
   And really, that's the problem. With a full cast, the Coyotes
would've already won this series and moved on. With a decimated
lineup, there is little for the Blues to fear.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sullivan is limping like he has a leg full of shrapnel.
Greg Adams has missed four games with a sore groin. Yuha Jlonen and
Jeremy Roenick are gone. And sheer talent is starting to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Blues were in control from the start, outskating,
outhitting and outwilling the opponent. They won 14 of the first 21
faceoffs. They held the Coyotes to 21 shots on goal. It was a
miracle that the Coyotes entered the final period with a chance to
win the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't come out to play in the first 20 minutes,'' Mike
Stapleton said. ``And they jumped on us.''
</P>
<P>
   So throw the guarantee out the window. It was an attempt to draw
all analysis to Schoenfeld's bravado, to suck the pressure out of
the room and place it squarely on his shoulders. For one day, it
worked. But in reality, it's pointless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's job is on the line here,'' Keith Tkachuk said.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the real story. &QL;

Rockets' plan off and running
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By FRAN BLINEBURY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early in the first quarter, Charles Barkley pulled a defensive
rebound off the glass, lowered his head, gained momentum going up
the court like a tractor trailer on the open road and rolled all
the way to the hoop for a layup.
</P>
<P>
   Very late in the fourth quarter, Barkley wrapped his mitts
around one more rebound, turned and fired a long, would-be
touchdown pass to a galloping Scottie Pippen, who might have wasted
an easy scoring opportunity if not for his racing buddy Hakeem
Olajuwon trailing the play for a follow-up dunk.
</P>
<P>
   In between, the Rockets did more running than a late-arriving
plane load of Cancun vacationers with Montezuma's revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Charles charged. Scottie sped. Hakeem hustled. Michael motored.
Cuttino cruised. Sam streaked.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like they were shooting a TV commercial for one of the
long-distance phone carriers. You know, Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   At times it appeared to be a track meet. At other times it
looked a little like the Kentucky Derby with so many thoroughbreds
racing to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Message is clear
</P>
<P>
   To the untrained eye, it may have seemed like just an ordinary
beating of the LA Clippers, the unofficial punching bags of the
NBA. But to the Rockets, who have been on the receiving end of too
many wallops themselves lately, it was a much-needed tonic. And to
Barkley, it was a message.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to go down in this thing anywhere short of a
championship, then at least we're going to go down taking our best
swing,'' Barkley said. ``And that means running with the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means getting the ball off the boards and running. It means
taking the ball out of the basket when the other team scores and
running. It means picking up any loose ball or seeing any
opportunity and running. It's the only chance we've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Or at least it's better than the option the Rockets had been
putting on display lately in losing five of their previous six
games _ standing around and watching each other shoot 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a talk with Scottie before the game, and I told him that
we might as well get out there and run with the ball and try to get
things moving,'' Barkley said. ``I mean, what do we have to lose?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the way things are with people getting the blame. I
told Scottie that he and I are going to be blamed here if we don't
win it all, so let's just try to do what we can. My grandmother
told me, `If you have a gun, shoot it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets shot the ball at a 51 percent clip and drilled 11 of
21 from behind the 3-point stripe, which does cover up a lot of
sins. But they also made sharp, crisp cuts on offense, had
excellent ball movement, bounced all over the floor on defense. The
way they flew all over the floor, they looked like, well, Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   How different was this picture than the staid, conservative
portrait of defeat that couldn't get out of its own way on Friday
night in losing to the Jazz?
</P>
<P>
   Well, consider that there were just over three minutes left in
the first half when the Rockets first dumped the ball down low to
either Barkley or Olajuwon in the low post.
</P>
<P>
   This was a completely different, more upbeat look. It was
Olajuwon making himself available for medium-range jumpers from all
around the lane. It was Pippen filling lanes on the fast break. It
was the two kids, Michael Dickerson and Cuttino Mobley, getting to
race all over the playground like a couple of kids.
</P>
<P>
   It starts with Charles
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, it was Barkley, pushing, prodding, urging, goading them
to run at every single opportunity. He ran through traffic, and he
ran sometimes ahead of the fast break. He would kick the ball out
to one of the guards to move the ball ahead, and then he'd kick it
into a higher gear himself and beat the ball to the other end,
where he converted follow-up hoops.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley had 19 points and 12 rebounds, five of them on the
offensive boards. Olajuwon went off for 20 points, Brent Price for
15, Pippen for 14, seven rebounds and seven assists. It was even a
night when a ``Pig'' could fly as Anthony Miller hustled up and
down the floor for eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is part of the upcoming Nike ad campaign that will
once again feature Barkley. After all, you can hardly be hawking
sneakers if you never run in them. More likely, it really is the
best chance the Rockets have in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unrealistic to ask people to stand around the 3-point
line watching, take maybe five shots a game and then bust their
(tail) on defense,'' Barkley said. ``We have to run no matter what,
and that's what we're doing from here on in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got Scottie here now to take some of the heat. He's my
Steve Austin, the $67 million man, and we're together on this.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny. You have all these guys making all this money. But
when it comes down to it, you know all the blame is gonna be put on
poor, measly, million-dollar Chuck.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'm running till I drop.''

CARTER'S LITTLE THRILLS GO ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's been a whirlwind two days for Anson Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Early Saturday morning, he put the Bruins on the brink of
winning their first playoff series since 1994 with a goal at 14:45
of the second overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night he helped push them over the top.
</P>
<P>
   His goal at 8:13 of the second period gave the Bruins some
breathing room, while at the same time seemingly bursting the
Carolina bubble, and helped advance him and many others on this
team into unchartered territory.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-0 win over Carolina, before a roaring FleetCenter crowd,
gave the Bruins the series, 4 games to 2, and sent them into the
Eastern Conference semifinals against an opponent yet to be
determined.
</P>
<P>
   As often happens, Carter's goal came just seconds after Gary
Roberts missed a golden opportunity to pull Carolina even when he
rifled a rebound high over the glass with Bruins goalie Byron Dafoe
out of the net.
</P>
<P>
   Carter picked up the rebound, weaved his way down the right
wing, and then cut towards the net, where he was met by Carolina
defenders Steve Halko and Paul Coffey. He flicked the puck to the
left to an open Steve Heinze, and then Heinze fed it back to him
and he had Carolina goaltender Arturs Irbe down and out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just saw the highlights and we couldn't believe how many
empty nets they missed,'' said Carter, who had three goals in the
series. ``I think someone upstairs wanted us to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``But these things happen. How many times do you see one team
miss a great opportunity and then the other team come down and
score? It seems to happen all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said the Bruins were confident, but not overly so, after
taking a 2-0 lead into the final 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we were confident, but at the same time, we knew exactly
what we did in their rink, coming back from a 2-0 deficit. We knew
one goal wasn't a big lead and two goals is the worst lead in
hockey. A team scores one goal to cut that lead in half, and then
the other team tightens up. We didn't want that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said the fans played a key role in this win and he tipped
his hat to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could feel the energy, I felt the electricity,'' he said.
``I usually don't hear the crowd, but tonight was one of those rare
cases where you could feel the excitement just walking into the
rink.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way we wanted to go back down (to Greensboro) and
face that hostile crowd there in a Game 7. The fans let us know
they didn't want us to, either. They really jacked us up. It was
nice to hear their approval. We used the crowd as a positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter likened the past 48 hours to a thrill ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great experience, but a roller coaster type
experience,'' he said. ``After that big goal the other night you're
sky high, but then you have to come right back down to earth and
get ready for the next game. The older guys on the team were great
and helped me get through that emotional high I was on.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me that during the playoffs there would be a lot of
ups and downs. That overtime goal was a high point, but earlier in
that game there was a low point when I missed my coverage on the
point man.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, Carter was back on a high.

RALLY IN THE 9TH FALLS FLAT AFTER BULLPEN BLOWS LEAD 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ The Diamondbacks had the bases loaded with no outs
in the ninth inning Sunday and their three hottest hitters coming
to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Bell, Luis Gonzalez and Matt Williams, who have 24 home runs
among them, couldn't get a ball deep enough to score a run, and the
Milwaukee Brewers held on for a 6-5 victory at County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody told me we'd have the bases loaded, nobody out and
Jay, myself and Matty coming up, I would have bet the farm we'd get
a run,'' Gonzalez said. ``But that's why this is baseball, and
strange things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't have gotten much stranger than during a wild eighth
and ninth in a roller-coaster game that saw Williams launch two
home runs and the Diamondbacks' bullpen revert to opening week
failures and blow two leads.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Olson, recalling Los Angeles and Atlanta where he blew
three save opportunities in the first week, gave up a three-run
homer to pinch-hitter Marquis Grissom with two outs in the eighth
that gave the Brewers the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``No excuses,'' said Olson, who saved two games in as many days,
coming into Sunday. ``I just failed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers' closer, Bob Wickman, wasn't much steadier during
his turn in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks seemed to have the right-hander flustered,
after they twice pointed out to the home-plate umpire that Wickman
was going to his mouth with his fingers. That's an automatic called
ball, and pinch-hitter David Dellucci reached base on a walk to
start the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was mad at us for calling the umpire's attention to it,''
Manager Buck Showalter said. ``That's a rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Finley, pinch-hitting, then singled, and Wickman walked
leadoff man Tony Womack on four pitches to load the bases for Bell,
who hit his eighth home run on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bell bounced meekly to Wickman, who got the force out at the
plate. The throw to first was in the dirt and Sean Berry wasn't
able to scoop it up, leaving the bases jammed for Gonzalez, who had
doubled in the fourth to extend his hitting streak to 16 games and
walked twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get something up, to stay out of a double play,''
Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   He got something up _ a pitch that went up in his hands.
Gonzalez hit the ball into right. Finley was halfway between third
and home, as right fielder Jeromy Burnitz, known to have one of the
strongest arms in the league, charged and caught the ball, sliding
on his knees before getting up to throw.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Finley got back to third, it was too late to tag and
try to score.
</P>
<P>
   Burnitz said, ``if he's tagging, no,'' he doesn't get Finley at
the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't forecast him sliding on his knees as he gets up to
throw,'' said third-base coach Brian Butterfield.
</P>
<P>
   Said Finley, ``That's one of those Catch-22 balls. If he short
hops it and you're tagging, you're dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter called it ``a good read by a good base runner and a
good third-base coach.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks (14-12) had one more chance at a three-game
sweep of the Brewers with their most dangerous hitter at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   On a 1-0 pitch, Williams hit a sharp line drive that Wickman
snagged to end the game and the Brewers' five-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit it off the end of the bat,'' said Williams, whose
two-run homer in the eighth gave Arizona a 5-3 lead. ``I thought it
might have a chance. He made a good play.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasted in the three-hour, 37-minute marathon was a decent effort
by starter Armando Reynoso, who left at the end of six innings with
the score tied at 1. He threw 116 pitches, 38 of them in a rocky
fifth, when he was fortunate to escape with just one run.
</P>
<P>
   Wasted was catcher Damian Miller's seventh-inning, two-run
homer. Wasted, too, was Williams' third lifetime multihomer game in
County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Brian Anderson gave up four singles and two runs in
the seventh when the Brewers tied it.

FEUD HURTS THOSE WITH NO OPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A growing feud between a longtime Phoenix
trainer-turned-promoter and the Arizona State Boxing Commission is
beginning to shrink an already limited number of opportunities for
the state's youngest fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer/promoter  &UR; Willy Borchert and  &UR; John Montano, the
commission's executive director, are involved in a tug of a war
over control.
</P>
<P>
   The battle lines are familiar. Businessmen and regulators are
often at odds, regardless of whether they're selling bouts or
bagels. From one perspective, regulation is interference. From the
other, it's protection for customers and participants alike.
</P>
<P>
   Compromise keeps everybody in business. Trouble is, there's been
no apparent move toward compromise in the Borchert-Montano
struggle. Borchert canceled a card scheduled for May 11 at Midnight
Rodeo out of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much hassle,'' Borchert said.
</P>
<P>
   The losers? Young fighters who are looking for a chance to
develop.
</P>
<P>
   Borchert complains that Montano has taken on the role of
matchmaker. He said Montano exercises arbitrary power in
sanctioning bouts. Montano has asked to see some of Borchert's
proposed fighters either train, spar or run a couple of miles just
a few days before the opening bell.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Gov.  &UR; Jane Hull, Borchert accuses Montano of
``rude and abusive behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Montano counters that he is simply fulfilling his
job description.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must ensure the safety of the boxers,'' Montano said. ``It's
my responsibility to guarantee the safest possible atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are now federal provisions that require me to do that.
The commission provides scrutiny of matches, including approval and
denial. By law, we have to do that. Ethically, we must do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The unfortunate aspect in this standoff is that Borchert and
Montano are two of the best people in Arizona boxing. They
genuinely care about the sport and the young men who go into harm's
way.
</P>
<P>
   Borchert jumped into the promotional wars, simply because he
wanted to give apprentice fighters a chance.
</P>
<P>
   In boxing's increasingly big-time, pay-per-view atmosphere,
there are fewer and fewer opportunities for kids who didn't make
the Olympic team or couldn't find backing from a major promoter.
</P>
<P>
   In the other corner, there's Montano, who watches controversy
tear apart a sport he has loved all his life. The sad spectacle
stretches from  &UR; Mike
 &UR; Tyson's bite to the inexplicable scoring in the  &UR; Lennox
Lewis-Evander
 &UR; Holyfield draw.
</P>
<P>
   Montano has to look at the tattered national scene and say to
himself:
</P>
<P>
   Not here. Not in my state.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Montano has become more involved with federal
legislation sponsored by Sen.  &UR; John McCain of Arizona &UR; . Montano is
vice president of the National Association of Boxing Commissions,
which is trying wrest the powers of assigning judges from the
various ruling acronyms.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem here is personal. Borchert and Montano are
headstrong. If both can get beyond their stubborn pride, they might
discover they have a mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
   For a lot of young fighters, there is no other option. &QL; 
Briefly . . . &QL; 
Open scoring was dismissed by  &UR; Mark Johnson, who won the
International Boxing Federation's junior-bantamweight title a week
ago when scores were announced after the fifth and eight rounds.
``Why should I go out and take a chance?'' said Johnson, who knew
he was way ahead after the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's move to junior bantam means he has vacated the IBF's
flyweight title. That might open the door for  &UR; Michael Carbajal in
his comeback hopes for a major flyweight crown.

KINGS SPOILED SUNS SEASON IN 1981 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ The Kings are the journeymen. In name. And fact.
</P>
<P>
   The franchise has gone from Rochester, to Cincinnati, to Omaha
and Kansas City, and now Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, there has been a consistent intersection:
</P>
<P>
   The Suns.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' last memory of better times came at the expense of
Phoenix. As the Kings close on what would be only their third
playoff appearance since 1985, they remember the last time they won
a playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1981. In the second round, the Kings upset the Suns, then
the Pacific Division champions.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings coach?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cotton Fitzsimmons, now a Suns vice president. Fitzsimmons'
Kings won Game 7 at Veterans Memorial Coliseum despite an
injury-wracked roster. He slowed down the ball and confused the
more talented Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of special teams, but that was the best
coaching I ever did,'' Fitzsimmons said. ``We won Game 7 on Easter
Sunday. I know someone up there must have loved me that
afternoon.'' &QL; 
Sideline chatter &QL; 
There's no respect, not even for a former King.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the third quarter, a Sacramento fan got a smile from
Suns Coach
 &UR; Danny Ainge when he yelled:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Danny, you're just a tall  &UR; Bobby Hurley,'' in reference
to a former Kings guard who struggled throughout his stay in
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge, also a former Kings guard, looked up into the crowd and
countered:
</P>
<P>
   ``Wasn't I a little better shooter than him?'' &QL; 
Bench assist &QL; 
Former Arizona State guard  &UR; Byron Scott works as a Kings assistant
coach alongside former Suns Coach  &UR; John Wetzel.
</P>
<P>
   Scott brings experience to the Kings that includes three
championship rings as a starter for the Los Angeles Lakers in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told all the guys I keep my rings in a safe deposit box in
Los Angeles, and I only pull them out when I want to see them
again,'' he said. ``Usually, that's in the summertime, but once we
get to the playoffs, I might go back home and pull them out and
show them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why you play in this league. It's not for the money
and all the other accolades. It's for the rings, for the
championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you win these, nobody can ever take these away from
you.''
</P>
<P>
   But Scott said time does take away some other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time my hair grows a little, I cut it back off, just so
I don't have to see if it's turning white up there or not,'' he
said. &QL; 
Briefly &QL; 
Odd couple: Former ASU Coach  &UR; Bill Freider was in the ARCO Arena
crowd with &UR; Steve Fisher, his former assistant at Michigan. Fisher
took over for Frieder and won an NCCA title for the Wolverines a
decade ago. &QL;

FINLEY ENJOYS MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Jeff Finley's worlds were colliding.
</P>
<P>
   There he stood, sharing the ice with a team that didn't want him
badly enough and a team that, at this particular moment, needed him
desperately.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the juxtaposition is what inspired the St. Louis
defenseman, who took a corner feed from center Pierre Turgeon and
slapped in what proved to be the winning goal in the Blues' 5-3
victory over the Coyotes in Game 6 of the first-round playoff
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``To score is always exciting, especially when you don't do it
often,'' the former Coyote said.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't kidding. Finley's goal was only his second in 18
months and his first since March 22. It was also his first playoff
goal ever.
</P>
<P>
   His timing was perfect. The game was tied at 3 in the third
period, with St. Louis on the brink of elimination.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes goalie Nikolai Khabibulin stopped Finley's first
attempt, but the puck found Turgeon in the corner, who fed it back
to the wide-open Finley. He sent it higher and over Khabibulin's
pad to make it 4-3 at 8:59. Center Craig Conroy scored nearly seven
minutes later to secure the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the biggest goal of my career, definitely,'' Finley
said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a career that started with the New York Islanders and had
stops with Philadelphia, Winnipeg/Phoenix and the New York Rangers
before he came to St. Louis on Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
   He played in 65 games for the Coyotes, scoring three goals and
seven assists, but when he became an unrestricted free agent in
1997, the better offer came from the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no hard feelings,'' Finley said. ``In fact, when I
look back, I remember it as a tremendous experience. So many people
had many doubts at the time about how people would react to hockey
in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the people responded and treated us and to be part of
that experience the first time out was great.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley's agent, Art Breeze, was less kind at the time,
criticizing the Coyotes for not re-signing Finley or another
client, winger Jim McKenzie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later, as witnessed by the recent loss of two
high-profile free agents, someone in Phoenix management should
learn that winning teams treat their players with dignity and
respect,'' Breeze said.
</P>
<P>
   Finley emphasized that he remembers his experience as positive.
But he did find irony in his team's future being affected by the
Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a trying season at times for the 32-year-old. It
began with the Rangers but also included three months with Hartford
of the American Hockey League. He was traded to St. Louis on Feb.
13 and has played in all but one game since.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always nice to see players like Finley and Conroy, who
work so hard, get the big goals and help us win,'' Turgeon said.
``That's exactly what we needed today. We're the kind of team, at
least during the season, that gets contributions from everyone.'' &QL;

COYOTES' PENALTY KILLERS PLAY DEAD AGAINST BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ This killing time is killing the Coyotes. And if
they aren't careful, it could kill everything.
</P>
<P>
   The head coach. The Los Arcos arena vote. Maybe a star player
such as Jeremy Roenick, Keith Tkachuk or Robert Reichel.
</P>
<P>
   But first, it would simply kill their first-round playoff series
against the St. Louis Blues, now knotted at three games apiece with
everything on the line Tuesday night in Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   Because the Coyotes' penalty killers, at one point the best
bunch in the entire NHL, are getting killed by the Blues' power
play.
</P>
<P>
   It was the difference once again in Game 6 of the series Sunday
at the Kiel Center. St. Louis scored two more power-play goals,
including the tying score late in the second period, that resulted
in a 5-3 victory and prevented the Coyotes from wrapping up the
series for the second straight time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our penalty killing has killed us in this series, and their
power play has killed us,'' Phoenix center and penalty killer Mike
Stapleton said. ``We're just not getting the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blues have a league-high nine power-play goals after six
games, the most ever scored in one series against the Coyotes'
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the Blues' 18 goals in the series have come with at
least one Phoenix player sitting in the penalty box. Can you see a
trend developing here or what?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the same thing all series long,'' Coyotes defenseman
J.J. Daigneault said. ``It's the one thing we wanted to avoid, and
we were unable to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Daigneault was whistled twice Sunday, both for hooking. The
first one broke up a two-on-one St. Louis rush, which was
acceptable, especially since the Blues didn't score on the ensuing
man-advantage. But the second one, which tripped up Pavol Demitra,
was critical.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes had just scored on a power-play goal of their own by
Teppo Numminen to take a 3-2 lead with 6:09 left in the second.
Three minutes later, Chris Pronger banged in a rebound with a
dejected Daigneault in the box to steal the momentum, not only in
the game, but in the series as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, our power play's been the difference. It hasn't skipped
a beat,'' said Blues forward Scott Young, who scored on a
first-period power play for St. Louis in which the Coyotes never
once could clear the puck out of their zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues' power play ranked third in the league during the
regular season at 20.3 percent. The Coyotes' penalty-killing unit
ended up fifth-best at 87.1 percent. To be fair, however, Phoenix
has been without two of its penalty killers, injured forwards
Roenick and Juha Ylonen. On Sunday, they also were missing Mike
Sullivan, out because of a bruised leg after getting hit by a shot
in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, it probably would be tough to stop them even if we had
those guys,'' Coyotes forward Dallas Drake admitted. ``Our penalty
killers were exhausted out there, but sometimes, you've got to
sacrifice a little bit more. Dive headfirst in front of a shot if
you have to.''
</P>
<P>
   They've thrown themselves in front of Al MacInnis and his
howitzer of a slap shot, which has been timed at more than 100 mph.
But the St. Louis defenseman still has six of his nine points on
the power play.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're scared of Al's shots, and they're trying to take it
away,'' Demitra said of the Coyotes, ``but that just leaves more
room for the other four guys out there to make something happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes can't play like a collection of Lady Byngs and stay
away from any physical contact. That's not their game. But
penalties could be the death of them. And a whole lot more. &QL;

PLAYERS BACK SCHOENFELD'S VICTORY PROM ISE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ It didn't take long for  &UR; Jim Schoenfeld's postgame
comments to filter back into the Coyotes' locker room Sunday after
their 5-3 loss in Game 6 of their first-round playoff series to the
St. Louis Blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to win Game 7,'' the head coach predicted. `` . .
. I would tell you I would stake my job on it, but that's already
been done, so I'll just say we're going to win Game 7.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld's prediction, however, went over well with most of
his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like that. Did he really say that? I'm backing him up
then,'' defenseman
 &UR; J.J. Daigneault said. ``I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   So did center,  &UR; Bob Corkum, who said, ``I'm right behind him on
that one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I loved that guy,'' chimed in  &UR; Jeremy Roenick, who has
missed the series with a broken jaw and fractured thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes captain  &UR; Keith Tkachuk, however, was a little bothered
by Schoenfeld's job-status reference, which further fuels questions
about the coach's future in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who starts that stuff, you (media) guys? Does somebody tell
you that?'' Tkachuk said. ``I'm not worried about that. He's our
coach. He's done a great job this year. We can't worry about that.
Everybody's job is on the line here. We're all in it together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with Shoney saying that. He's a great guy, but
you have to win for each other. I don't believe in that. It's out
of my control. We're all in it together as an organization. We
don't need any of that before Game 7.''
</P>
<P>
   Game 7 is Tuesday night at America West Arena. As of Sunday,
3,000 tickets remained. &QL; 
What if . . . &QL; 
If the Coyotes win Tuesday night, the second-round series probably
will start Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes would play Dallas if Colorado beats San Jose in that
first-round series, which the Avalanche leads, 3-2. If San Jose
wins Games 6 and 7 to advance to the second round, the Coyotes
would play Detroit in a Western semifinal series.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes would open on the road regardless of the opponent. &QL; 
Memory power (play) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis has scored a playoff-high nine power-play goals in the
series, including two more on Sunday by  &UR; Scott Young and  &UR; Chris
Pronger. It's already the most power-play goals the Coyotes have
had scored against them in a single series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't help but think back to the time Minnesota went to the
Finals,'' Young said, referring to the 1990-1991 North Stars.
``Their power play was unbelievable. It was on fire. That's why
special teams are so important. Especially in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The North Stars scored a playoff record 35 power-play goals in
23 total playoff games, but lost to the Pittsburgh Penguins in a
six-game series. Coyotes General Manager  &UR; Bobby Smith played for
the North Stars that season and scored both of Minnesota's
game-winning goals in the two games the North Stars won. &QL; 
Sitting out &QL; 
Although it was St. Louis' most balanced effort of the playoffs,
one player who wasn't a big factor was left wing  &UR; Geoff Courtnall,
who played less than seven minutes Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Courtnall, who has played in 16 NHL seasons, missed 57 games
this season with post-concussion syndrome. He returned April 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' he said. ``I don't know what the reason is, but
when you get to the playoffs, you can't complain about anything.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting a taste of what it's like to sit out for a long
stretch, Courtnall said he can find the patience, knowing how lucky
he is to still be competing. &QL; 
Fore and Fuhr &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Golfer  &UR; Phil Mickelson must have had a vision about this series.
After the Blues' win on Friday in Phoenix, Mickelson told St. Louis
goalie  &UR; Grant Fuhr not to worry about signing a stick the golfer
had for a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do it Monday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two are expected to play golf together today, which might
stir up the rumor mill again after Fuhr was accused of playing 36
holes the day before he allowed the Coyotes to score five goals in
Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Fuhr once again laughed at the notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you turn 25, 36 is out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhr, 36, insisted he played 18 and will do the same today. &QL; 
What advantage? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman  &UR; Al MacInnis, the Blues' leading playoff scorer with
9 points, has played on teams that blew 3-1 leads in seven-game
series and were eliminated, and he thinks he has a good idea what
the Coyotes are thinking as they try to circle the wagons for Game
7.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough and frustrating when you get up like that,'' he
said. ``I'm sure they are thinking about Game 5 (3-2 overtime loss)
and letting it slip away like that. The only thing I can say is
going into Game 7, I'd rather be going in having won two rather
than losing two. Momentum is a funny thing, but we have it now.'' &QL;

SLOW START BE WILDERING TO BENES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ After beginning his workouts earlier than usual,
after losing body fat and increasing his strength, Diamondbacks
pitcher  &UR; Andy Benes envisioned a better start than this, even for a
traditional slow starter.
</P>
<P>
   After five outings, he is 2-2 with an 8.76 ERA. He closed last
season without yielding an earned run in his last 27 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Since his last start Wednesday, when he gave up four earned runs
in six innings to Houston, Benes has been watching film of his last
five starts from last season. Included in the movie classics was
his no-hitter for 8 innings Sept. 13 against the Cincinnati Reds at
Cinergy Field.
</P>
<P>
   Benes hopes the trip back to the site of his greatest
achievement will help. He'll start today's opener of a three-game
series against the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try not to get too irritated,'' Benes said. ``You try to
find out what you're doing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Benes, who won seven of his last nine decisions last year, said
his main problem is feeling comfortable on the rubber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been in good position to throw the ball,'' he said.
``I think I'll get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach  &UR; Mark Connor said he's been working on mechanics
with Benes since Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going uphill on his delivery some,'' Connor said. ``His
fastball is closer to his slider. There's only 5 to 7 mph
difference. There's no variance in velocity. We want him to be at
92 to 93 (mph). No doubt, he'll get there. His command is the
biggest thing.'' &QL; 
Climate control &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder  &UR; Luis Gonzalez, who extended his franchise-record
hitting streak to 16 games Sunday, usually starts the season
slowly, but feels the change of scenery did him good.
</P>
<P>
   He played last year for the Detroit Tigers, where he hit 23 home
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel more comfortable with the surroundings,'' Gonzalez
said. ``In Detroit, I hit some home runs, but it was a young team.
Here, it's more relaxed. Guys aren't as intense (in the clubhouse).
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys were on pins and needles (in Detroit). Instead of
worrying about being in the big leagues, they were worried about
staying in the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez had a career-best 23-game hitting streak with the
Houston Astros two years ago. He says he doesn't think about
streaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go out with the same approach every time to have a good,
solid at-bat,'' he said. &QL; 
Short stops &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reliever  &UR; Greg Swindell had his first plate appearance since
1996 on Saturday. He flied to right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to make contact and not look stupid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Only three second basemen in the major leagues have hit 40 or
more home runs in a season:  &UR; Rogers Hornsby, Ryne Sandberg and
 &UR; Davey Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four after this year,'' third baseman  &UR; Matt Williams said loud
enough for second baseman  &UR; Jay Bell to hear. ``How's that for
pressure?''
</P>
<P>
   Bell has eight homers, but says he's no threat to win a home run
title. &QL;

CUBANS' VISIT INCITES EMOTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE - This lunch-pail-in-hand, blue-collar city where
people work hard for a living figures to be transformed into one
huge ratings-gathering network news event today.
</P>
<P>
   In the eye of what figures to be a hurricane will be, of all
things, a baseball game.
</P>
<P>
   However, this will be no simple Sunday-in-the-park ballgame.
This event will mark the first time a team composed solely of
Cuban-born players will play against a major league club on U.S.
soil.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Baltimore Orioles' turn tonight to host the final game
of a goodwill two-game exhibition series between the long-sparring
nations at the gem of a stadium called Camden Yards, where tickets
have been long gone for the historic game.
</P>
<P>
   The two clubs met in Cuba in late March, when the Orioles eked
out a 3-2 victory in 11 innings. Critical comments were many after
it was learned the 50,000 tickets to ``Estadio Latinoamerica'' were
distributed by invitation to government employees only.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Orioles are facing criticism of their own for strict
guidelines being imposed for the game.
</P>
<P>
   For those who believe the laughable Orioles, bearers of the
worst record in the majors, were incapable of electrifying this
baseball-mad area this season, here's proof of the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the 1999 Baltimore Orioles actually have little to do
with the rousing emotions building for this game.
</P>
<P>
   The always hot-button issue known as politics is taking the
staring role for this monumental game. Basically, the Orioles have
done very little _ which may be the best way to describe their
season _ other than schedule the game.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-American groups from Miami to New Jersey, most of them
strongly obstinate, are ready to stage countless protests. Many
will occur outside Camden Yards in designated areas. Some groups,
however, are ready to defy the Orioles' ban of allowing them inside
Camden Yards.
</P>
<P>
   You can bet these groups will have no problem taking on whatever
authority is inside Camden Yards, and tangling with guards is
almost a certainty.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban exiles living here are emotional when it comes to the
politics surrounding U.S. relations with their former homeland.
It's the single-biggest reason busloads of people, some who don't
know the first thing about baseball, will caravan to a city that
sits a leisurely 40-minute drive from Washington, the bastion for
freedom around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles are so worried about what might happen that they
successfully petitioned to the Federal Aviation Administration to
have a three-mile radius around the stadium be off-limits to
aircrafts flying below 1,500 feet. Such aircrafts generally tow
banners or drop leaflets over sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the club will enforce a ban on flags and musical
instruments and will ask fans who chant to leave if it is deemed
they are disturbing others.
</P>
<P>
   The previous paragraph could have been written about communist
Cuba, not the land where free speech is guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles can do this because they lease the publicly financed
Camden Yards from the state of Maryland and can set any guidelines
inside the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   While Cuban-American groups will be busy protesting what they
believe is a feather in President Fidel Castro's cap, it very well
could become a black eye instead, if even one of the Cuban
ballplayers manages to defect during the team's stay in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past seven years, more than a dozen Cuban ballplayers
have managed to defect, among them New York Yankees pitcher Orlando
``El Duque'' Hernandez, his half-brother Livan Hernandez, who
pitches for Florida, New York Mets shortstop Rey Ordonez, Tampa Bay
pitcher Rolando Arrojo and Rene Arocha, who began the list of
defections when he walked away at the Miami airport in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   It would instead turn into a coup for Cubans living here, and
agent Joe Cubas, who has helped more than a dozen ballplayers
defect in the past six years and has always been known as someone
capable of pulling off the impossible.
</P>
<P>
   There are strong rumors that Cubas, who has been in Baltimore
since Thursday, may already have lined up the defections of at
least two players who may be on the Cuban roster. This is one of
the reasons the Cubans have been so secretive in releasing the
names of the 25-man roster.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the hotel where the Cubans are staying will not
allow incoming phone calls to the players. Also, the floors where
the Cuban delegation is staying are cordoned off from the public.
In short, it's similar to a police state.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens in tonight's game, the events surrounding
it will be of greater magnitude that any run-scoring double Albert
Belle or Omar Linares may hit.
</P>
<P>
   This is a game of political chicken, where Cuba stands to be the
only loser, even if the team wins tonight. &QL;

GORDON COASTS IN CAL 500 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ Ho-hum. Jeff Gordon again.
</P>
<P>
   Just when it seemed as if Gordon's viselike grip on the NASCAR
Winston Cup throne might be loosening, thanks to three
uncharacteristic DNFs through the season's first nine races,
stock-car racing's dominant driver delivered another sparkling run
into victory lane Sunday at California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, 27, who has won a remarkable 45 races in just 199 career
starts, easily captured the California 500 by 4.492 seconds over
runner-up Jeff Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least it seemed easy.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon led 151 of 250 laps, including 86 of the final 87, and
won for the third time this season.
</P>
<P>
   What slump?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some rough (races) lately, but I knew we could get
back to victory lane, and we proved it today,'' said Gordon, a
victim of three crashes in the past four races.
</P>
<P>
   Proved it?
</P>
<P>
   Heck, the Rainbow Warriors, the nickname given to Gordon's
hearty band of Mr. Fixit crew members, put their seal of approval
on it.
</P>
<P>
   With crew chief Ray Evernham barking signals, Gordon was able to
double a tenuous two-second lead over Bobby Labonte with a
lightning-quick, green-flag pit stop on Lap 207.
</P>
<P>
   Need an analogy? Think of it as Cardinals quarterback Jake
Plummer completing a fourth-and-10 pass to Rob Moore with less two
minutes left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to crunch time, when the pressure is on and it's
time to make a great pit stop, that's what these guys do,'' Gordon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Evernham credited Gordon as much as the fueler, jackman and tire
changers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff did a great job making a clean stop on pit road and the
(pit crew) guys were flawless,'' Evernham said. ``Plus, I'm not
sure (Labonte's) guys maybe didn't have one of their best stops.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gordon returned to the racetrack, a two-second lead had
become nearly 4.5 seconds over Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Lap 215, it grew to 5.081. By Lap 216, it was 5.166.
</P>
<P>
   On Lap 229, it reached 5.594 seconds, and the rout was on.
</P>
<P>
   Except Burton had other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Burton passed Labonte on Lap 235 and began to slice ever so
gingerly into the lead.
</P>
<P>
   If Gordon was going to win, Burton reasoned, he wasn't going to
do so without having to keep an eye peeled on the rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, however, Burton realized all hope was lost, even
after cutting the deficit to an even three seconds on Lap 246.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure (Gordon) was running as hard as he could there at
the end,'' said Burton, who increased his lead in the drivers
standings to 55 points over Dale Jarrett. ``I suspect he wasn't. I
started doing the math in my head, and knew I couldn't (catch him).
So I backed off.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Tony Stewart capped another impressive race with a
fourth-place finish. Dale Jarrett was fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Ward Burton, Jeremy Mayfield, Wally Dallenbach and Terry
Labonte, who finished sixth through ninth, were the only other
drivers to finish on the lead lap.
</P>
<P>
   For Gordon, the win was a terrific pick-me-up after last week's
miserable showing at Talladega (Ala.) Superspeedway, a race in
which he departed early after a crash and a 38th-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   Ugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``This feels so good,'' Gordon said. ``We had a little bit of
bad luck here lately, but we're only human, and we're going to have
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we just have things go our way, if we just have some good
fortune instead of misfortune, we can win races. If we can get that
consistently, we'll be a factor in this championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``That happened today, and it helped that we had an awesome race
car.''
</P>
<P>
   Stick an awesome race car underneath Gordon and Sunday's result
in front of 117,000 spectators is what you usually get.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's luck even seemed to take a turn for the better.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gordon made a green-flag pit stop seconds before Ricky
Rudd produced a caution after a crash in Turn 3, he was able to
return to the wide two-mile oval so quickly, he still remained atop
the pack while the rest of the front-runners pitted under yellow. &QL;

PENALTY, FLAT TIRE DON'T KEEP JARRETT FROM GOOD FINISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ Beaten down with an ill-timed pit stop, a flat
tire and a stop-and-go penalty,  &UR; Dale Jarrett still managed a
top-five finish in Sunday's California 500 at California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett fell a lap down at one point, but he rallied and
remained runner-up to  &UR; Jeff Burton in the NASCAR Winston Cup
drivers standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came down pit road too soon, and I don't understand why you
get a penalty when you don't stop, but I guess that's the rule,''
said Jarrett, who was penalized for coming onto pit road before it
was open following a caution. ``Then, we go back to racing, and we
cut a left-rear tire down. I don't know why we didn't wreck, but we
got lucky and didn't hit anything.'' &QL; 
Numbers game &QL; 
There were five cautions for 23 laps, three of which were for
accidents. There were no serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jeff Gordon's average winning speed was 150.28 mph.
</P>
<P>
   $155,890: Gordon's winner's check. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gordon now has won two of the three races here. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers and NASCAR officials should be happy. Of the nine
cars finishing on the lead, Chevy, Ford and Pontiac each had
three. &QL; 
Tony the tiger &QL; 
Rookie  &UR; Tony Stewart has been terrific.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart finished fourth and now has two top-five and four top-10
finishes in 10 starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Gordon had the same statistics his rookie season.
Gordon, however, also had four DNFs. Stewart has none.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm finally starting to catch up to the capabilities
of my crew, and it's starting to show,'' Stewart said. ``If we can
keep running in the top five, I'll be tickled to death.'' &QL;

OTTIS NOT MESSING AROUND, RUNS FULL SPEED AT MINICAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. -  &UR; Brad Ottis has an unusual souvenir of his career
with the Cardinals. A screw.
</P>
<P>
   A surgical screw that didn't work. It was replaced with an even
larger one last September, causing Ottis, a defensive lineman, to
be placed on injured reserve and miss the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   Ottis saw considerable action as the first substitute across the
defensive line two seasons ago. Now he is back and, like the screw
in his left foot, even bigger than before. Intensive weight lifting
has helped him add eight pounds, making him 289. With it comes
reduced body fat, causing him to appear to be bigger yet.
</P>
<P>
   Ottis suffered a fractured foot while working out shortly before
minicamp last year. A screw was implanted surgically to help it
heal.
</P>
<P>
   Then during preseason, Ottis had the foot stepped on and
suffered a refracture that bent the screw. A new one, ``about five
inches long and about as big around as a ball-point pen,'' was
inserted to help the fracture heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I've run full speed since I broke my
foot,'' Ottis said Sunday at the conclusion of the Cardinals'
three-day minicamp. ``It feels great. I'm not worried about it
happening again. The doctors said I definitely won't bend this
screw. I've got the first one. It's at home. I just wanted it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's insurance, just as the return of Ottis is insurance
against injury of a front line defender. While Ottis prefers to
play end, his bulked up body will lend itself to his playing
tackle. Left tackle  &UR; Eric Swann is coming back from two knee
surgeries on his arthritic knee and right tackle  &UR; Mark Smith
skipped camp because he wants a larger contract offer. &QL; 
Lonesome ends &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the undrafted rookies, one who caught the eyes of both
Tobin and General Manager  &UR; Bob Ferguson is  &UR; Clarence Williams, a
5-9, 202-pound running back from Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``For being undrafted, he certainly has a lot of quickness,''
Tobin said. ``He has what I call juice. He can shake and bake. He's
a little off-size, but he catches well, and he can return kicks.
He'll be an interesting guy in training camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Another will be linebacker  &UR; Aaron Collins, who was in camp last
year as an undrafted rookie from Penn State before he was cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more mature and more confident,'' Tobin said. ``He has
excellent quickness. If he continues to show what he showed here,
he will be hard-pressed not to make the team.'' &QL;

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)
</P>
<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending April 24 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.
</P>
<P>
   An (x) following a book's ranking indicates that a book's sales
are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A (b)

<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ March 24, the day NATO jets first dropped bombs
on Yugoslavia, was hardly the beginning of troubles for the ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, or the starting point of their sorrowful
exile. In the months leading up to the assault, the Yugoslav army
and local police, often working in tandem, forced thousands of
Kosovars to flee their homes. Refugees in their own land, they
wandered from village to village in search of safety and shelter.
With the bombing, the Serbian government stepped up its tactics,
and , some 700,000 Albanians eventually left Kosovo outright, about
half of them crossing into Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The camps and shantytowns that have sprung up here are filled
with refugees who can tell stories of a traumatizing odyssey that
has lasted months. Among them is Skender Vehapi, a 47-year-old
farmer from the ancient village of Zatric in the mountains of
southwestern Kosovo, who left his home with his seven children and
extended family eight months ago. His account follows.
</P>
<P>
   _ By ANTHONY DePALMA
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how long our family has lived in Zatric. My
grandfather was born there and his father before him. We have been
there many, many years. Longer than anybody can remember.
</P>
<P>
   We had a very full life. We had two fields and part of another
with very fertile soil. We grew corn and wheat, and we had a
vineyard. I made a little wine for myself, but most of the grapes
were sold to the state winery nearby.
</P>
<P>
   In all, there were 25 people living on our farm, in two stone
and cement houses that I built myself. We had television, radio and
three djeps (Albanian cradles that are the symbol of Albanian
family and life). It was very beautiful. The village of Zatric is
near a great mountain. The Serbs have renamed it Gradiste, but in
Albanian it was always known as Shipe i Madh.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)The closest Serb enclave to Zatric is in
Orahovac, about five miles away. Rolling a cigarette that he would
smoke in a long metal holder, Vehapi said he never knew any Serbs
personally, and only saw them passing on the road. (END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago was the first sign that there was going to be
real trouble for Zatric.
</P>
<P>
   The police came to my house and also to the houses of my

   KUKES, Albania _ March 24, the day NATO jets first dropped bombs
on Yugoslavia, was hardly the beginning of troubles for the ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, or the starting point of their sorrowful
exile. In the months leading up to the assault, the Yugoslav army
and local police, often working in tandem, forced thousands of
Kosovars to flee their homes. Refugees in their own land, they
wandered from village to village in search of safety and shelter.
With the bombing, the Serbian government stepped up its tactics,
and , some 700,000 Albanians eventually left Kosovo outright, about
half of them crossing into Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The camps and shantytowns that have sprung up here are filled
with refugees who can tell stories of a traumatizing odyssey that
has lasted months. Among them is Skender Vehapi, a 47-year-old
farmer from the ancient village of Zatric in the mountains of
southwestern Kosovo, who left his home with his seven children and
extended family eight months ago. His account follows.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how long our family has lived in Zatric. My
grandfather was born there and his father before him. We have been
there many, many years. Longer than anybody can remember.
</P>
<P>
   We had a very full life. We had two fields and part of another
with very fertile soil. We grew corn and wheat, and we had a
vineyard. I made a little wine for myself, but most of the grapes
were sold to the state winery nearby.
</P>
<P>
   In all, there were 25 people living on our farm, in two stone
and cement houses that I built myself. We had television, radio and
three djeps (Albanian cradles that are the symbol of Albanian
family and life). It was very beautiful. The village of Zatric is
near a great mountain. The Serbs have renamed it Gradiste, but in
Albanian it was always known as Shipe i Madh.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)The closest Serb enclave to Zatric is in
Orahovac, about five miles away. Rolling a cigarette that he would
smoke in a long metal holder, Vehapi said he never knew any Serbs
personally, and only saw them passing on the road. (END ITALICS

</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago was the first sign that there was going to be
real trouble for Zatric.
</P>
<P>
   The police came to my house and also to the houses of my
relatives. They ordered us to give them our arms. But we didn't
have any guns. They came into the house and started searching for
guns. Then they beat me, right in front of my family, screaming at
me to give them my guns. But I didn't have anything.''

families, each with its own farm and houses. Only three of them
were not burned.

   The tractors were also burned, along with most of what we had
taken from the house. But the djep was about six feet away because
one of the children was playing with it and it was saved. My

and get it going again.''

   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)His home destroyed, Vehapi moved to the
village of Pastacel. March 24, the initiation of the NATO attacks,

of Pastacel knew they were next. They gathered to discuss what to
do. (END ITALICS HERE)

<P>
   ``The local people said we cannot go anywhere, we don't know
where to go. We must stay here. But I said to the villagers that we
must leave. But they refused to go.

<P>
   I took my family and my father-in-law and went to Ratkovac.
After we left Pastacel, the Serbian forces came in and surrounded
the people. It was a massacre. There were 106 people who were
killed, including 14 people from my own village of Zatric who had
taken refuge in Pastacel. The next day, after the Serbs had gone, I
left my family in Ratkovac and came back to Pastacel and helped to
bury the victims.
</P>
<P>
   What we saw was terrible. It was a nightmare. They had separated
all the men into groups of 15 each and killed them all in one
place. The bodies fell in groups into a small stream. The stream
was running with blood. The bodies were piled one on top of the
other.
</P>
<P>
   We spent three days trying to bury them. We took the bodies from
the stream and brought them to the field. When the police came
back, we ran. Then we came back and, using shovels, we buried them
in the field next to the mosque. They were not buried very deep,
just enough to cover them. We couldn't hold a ceremony or even put
up a marker for them. The head of the mosque said a brief prayer,
but that was it.''

   WASHINGTON _ In the debate over NATO's bombing of Serbia, the
voice of the American anti-war movement has not been heard to any
great degree. Once it was so loud that it helped end the Vietnam
War.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be heard soon if the war widens. Many protests so far
have included mostly Serbian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took the commencement of the bombing to jar me into
opposing it,'' said Tom Hayden, an anti-war leader in the 1960s and
'70s who now is a state senator in California.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden drew a parallel between the engagement in Vietnam and
that in Yugoslavia, saying the United States was ``in the shadow of
a prolonged and divisive and bloody war in a place no one had heard
of _ in one case Vietnam and in the other Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayden said more protests would occur if the bombing continued
and ground troops were sent in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The predictable sources of dissent are in the coalition''
supporting President Clinton, he said. ``It's a liberal war, a
Democratic Party war. People don't want to go against their own
president.'' Another reason is the lack of a draft, Hayden said.
And then there is Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. ``Nobody
likes Milosevic, making it initially difficult to get worked up
about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the anti-war movement like Jane Sammon, an editor for
The Catholic Worker, say it is too soon to draw parallels with
Vietnam. ``Are you saying that a month into the Vietnam war that a
reporter from The New York Times was asking where the protests
were?'' she said. ``I don't think that, in the beginning of
Vietnam, that most people were jaded enough to think that America
could violate international law.''
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Sheehan, the New England coordinator of the War Resisters
League and chairwoman of War Resisters International in London,
said the Internet and e-mail enabled the movement against the
bombing in Serbia to grow faster than it did in the days of
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Ney, disarmament coordinator at the War Resisters
League national headquarters in New York City, said, ``There have
been a lot of protests by different groups.'' A rally in New York
at Washington Square Park, he said, demanded ``an end to the
bombing, no ground troops and an end to the expulsion of
Kosovars.'' The International Action Center is planning a march in
Washington from the Vietnam War Memorial to the Pentagon on June 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person that I talk to in the street is just overwhelmed,''
Ms. Sheehan said. ``As activists, we're overloaded.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For an air war that many U.S. generals believe has
been run on the cheap, tactically, the bombardment of Yugoslavia
could go down as the most expensive military campaign, bomb for
bomb, in history.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton,
likes to brag that 90 percent of the bombs dropped in the 40-day
operation have been precision-guided, compared to only 9 percent in
the 1991 Persian Gulf war, reducing risks to civilians on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   But the cost of keeping the civilian casualties low is steep.
Cruise missiles fired from ships and submarines run $1 million
apiece, and their heftier cousins launched off B-52s cost twice
that. A laser-guided, 2,000-pound bomb dropped from a radar-evading
F-117 costs $26,200, compared to unguided bombs pitched from B-1
and B-52 bombers, which run about $600 each.
</P>
<P>
   When asked the other day if NATO was using million-dollar
weapons to bomb $10,000 targets, like military trucks and small
bridges, Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's military commander, bristled.
``This is not a war that we're running on a checkbook budget,'' he
snapped. ``We're running this war to be effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with all the armaments money can buy, though, the air war
has yet to achieve its goal of forcing Yugoslavia to withdraw its
troops in Kosovo and allowing refugees to return with international
military escorts. Politics and the elements have conspired to level
out the allies' technological edge. Bad weather trumps a pilot's
ability to aim a laser-guided bomb, and Defense Secretary William
Cohen said last week there have only been about half a dozen days
free from rain and fog.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the skies cleared, NATO pinpoint accuracy didn't stop
the 40,000-strong Yugoslav army and special police from purging
most of the 1.8 million ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, or from
avoiding gruesome civilian casualties, like the two convoys and a
passenger train that were accidentally blasted to bits by allied
warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, NATO's political leaders have restricted the targets
pilots could hit and the tactics they use to hit them. Low-flying
ground-attack planes like the A-10, ideal for blasting tanks, have
flown few bombing runs for fear they are still too vulnerable to
Yugoslav missiles. Other high-flying jets have picked up many of
those missions, but it's difficult to distinguish a farmer's truck
from armored infantry vehicle at 20,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's driving me nuts,'' said Gen. George Joulwan, Clark's
predecessor as supreme commander of the allied forces in Europe.
``We're better than this. I really don't understand, unless someone
thought we could drop a few bombs and get off cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Half-hearted tactics, perhaps, but the costs have been anything
but. Entering the sixth week of a campaign many NATO commanders
thought would last only a few days, the Pentagon is running up
bills that approach $1 billion, and Congress is preparing to
approve the Clinton administration's request for $6 billion to
finance the war through September, if needed. It's far less than
the much larger Persian Gulf war, which lasted 44 days and cost $61
billion (most of which allies like Saudi Arabia paid for). The
Pentagon says this war is costing about $37 million a day, and
that's not counting the relief operation for refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Congress prepares to add billions of dollars to the
administration's war tab to buy new bombs, missiles and other
weapons the Defense Department didn't request, some lawmakers are
criticizing the Pentagon's spendthrift ways in the Balkans. It's
costing $700 million to send 24 Apache helicopters and long-range
artillery from Germany to Albania, said Rep. John Murtha of
Pennsylvania, a senior Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. He
said he's angry that every night, NATO launches 300 to 600 missions
to bomb perhaps two dozen targets or so. With clear skies predicted
for the next few days, both numbers are likely to increase. ``I
need to hear why so many planes are up and there are so few
targets,'' said Murtha, a gruff former marine.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that NATO hasn't had enough bases for the
more than 700 allied aircraft joining the air war. Only recently
did NATO negotiate with Hungary to allow fighter-bombers and,
equally important, the refueling planes that keep them aloft. Now,
the aerial refuelers have to fly from as far away as Spain, England
and France, burning up precious fuel that could keep fighters
flying.
</P>
<P>
   One seasoned F-16 pilot, stationed at Aviano air base in Italy,
said in an interview that the air space is so crowded that the most
dangerous part of flying in the Balkans is circling at night, along
with dozens of other fighter jets, at 500 miles per hour in
thunderstorms and lightning to get more gasoline from airborne
refueling planes. ``It's kind of like New York City traffic up
there,'' the pilot said.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, Pentagon officials said, the Air Force
didn't plan ahead, as the Navy and Army did, to equip all its
aviators with night-vision goggles that cost $7,000 a set. ``It's
the difference between driving with your parking lights or
headlights,'' said the F-16 pilot, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   There are other mismatches between the high-cost mission and
tactical common sense. The combat debut of the B-2 bomber has been
notable, if for nothing else than its 31-hour (at $5,719 an hour)
round-trip flight to the Balkans from its base in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon might have stationed the stealthy B-2 in a friendly
country like Britain, and saved about $270,000 per mission, except
that the Air Force is squabbling with a California company over the
details of a contract to produce a mobile, climate-controlled
hangar that is needed to protect the bomber's sensitive,
radar-absorbing skin.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, NATO commanders are hoping just a few more of their
costly bombs will be needed to force Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to capitulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no interest in destroying more targets in Serbia than
is absolutely necessary,'' said Denmark's chief of defense, Gen.
Christian Hvidt, a former F-16 fighter pilot. ``We dislike using
power, really.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For an air war that many U.S. generals believe has
been run on the cheap, tactically, the bombardment of Yugoslavia
could go down as the most expensive military campaign, bomb for
bomb, in history.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton,
likes to brag that 90 percent of the bombs dropped in the 40-day
operation have been precision-guided, compared to only 9 percent in
the 1991 Persian Gulf war, reducing risks to civilians on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   But the cost of keeping the civilian casualties low is steep.
Cruise missiles fired from ships and submarines run $1 million
apiece, and their heftier cousins launched off B-52s cost twice
that. A laser-guided, 2,000-pound bomb dropped from a radar-evading
F-117 costs $26,200, compared to unguided bombs pitched from B-1
and B-52 bombers, which run about $600 each.
</P>
<P>
   When asked the other day if NATO was using million-dollar
weapons to bomb $10,000 targets, like military trucks and small
bridges, Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's military commander, bristled.
``This is not a war that we're running on a checkbook budget,'' he
snapped. ``We're running this war to be effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with all the armaments money can buy, though, the air war
has yet to achieve its goal of forcing Yugoslavia to withdraw its
troops in Kosovo and allowing refugees to return with international
military escorts. Politics and the elements have conspired to level
out the allies' technological edge. Bad weather trumps a pilot's
ability to aim a laser-guided bomb, and Defense Secretary William
Cohen said last week there have only been about half a dozen days
free from rain and fog.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the skies cleared, NATO pinpoint accuracy didn't stop
the 40,000-strong Yugoslav army and special police from purging
most of the 1.8 million ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, or from
avoiding gruesome civilian casualties, like the two convoys and a
passenger train that were accidentally blasted to bits by allied
warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, NATO's political leaders have restricted the targets
pilots could hit and the tactics they use to hit them. Low-flying
ground-attack planes like the A-10, ideal for blasting tanks, have
flown few bombing runs for fear they are still too vulnerable to
Yugoslav missiles. Other high-flying jets have picked up many of
those missions, but it's difficult to distinguish a farmer's truck
from armored infantry vehicle at 20,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's driving me nuts,'' said Gen. George Joulwan, Clark's
predecessor as supreme commander of the allied forces in Europe.
``We're better than this. I really don't understand, unless someone
thought we could drop a few bombs and get off cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Half-hearted tactics, perhaps, but the costs have been anything
but. Entering the sixth week of a campaign many NATO commanders
thought would last only a few days, the Pentagon is running up
bills that approach $1 billion, and Congress is preparing to
approve the Clinton administration's request for $6 billion to
finance the war through September, if needed. It's far less than
the much larger Persian Gulf war, which lasted 44 days and cost $61
billion (most of which allies like Saudi Arabia paid for). The
Pentagon says this war is costing about $37 million a day, and
that's not counting the relief operation for refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Congress prepares to add billions of dollars to the
administration's war tab to buy new bombs, missiles and other
weapons the Defense Department didn't request, some lawmakers are
criticizing the Pentagon's spendthrift ways in the Balkans. It's
costing $700 million to send 24 Apache helicopters and long-range
artillery from Germany to Albania, said Rep. John Murtha of
Pennsylvania, a senior Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. He
said he's angry that every night, NATO launches 300 to 600 missions
to bomb perhaps two dozen targets or so. With clear skies predicted
for the next few days, both numbers are likely to increase. ``I
need to hear why so many planes are up and there are so few
targets,'' said Murtha, a gruff former marine.
</P>

more than 700 allied aircraft joining the air war. Only recently

equally important, the refueling planes that keep them aloft. Now,

<P>
   If much about the murderous assault by two students in
Littleton, Colo., seemed so alien and bizarre as to be almost
ungraspable, there was at least one part of the story that seemed
as familiar as Big Macs and oldies radio.
</P>
<P>
   It was the world of jocks and nerds, preps and geeks, winners
and losers that defined life at Columbine High School before the
killing of a teacher and 14 students, including the suicides of the
two gunmen. It was something that is burned like a tattoo into the
memory bank of most adults. It was high school.
</P>
<P>
   The incident and other school shootings in places like Pearl,
Miss.; West Paducah, Ky.; Jonesboro, Ark., and Springfield, Ore.,
(Jonesboro was a middle school, the rest high schools) have been
viewed through many prisms _ guns and violence in the media, values
and parenting. Clearly, no single factor will ever explain any of
the incidents. But the fact that these horrors keep playing out in
the nation's high schools tracks closely longstanding and growing
concerns about the kind of educational and social environments they
provide.
</P>
<P>
   Many students, of course, have wonderful high school
experiences. And any view of high school life would do well to
remember the ways it mimics the world outside. But the most
comprehensive recent report on American high schools, ``Breaking
Ranks,'' by the National Association of Secondary School
Principals, concluded in 1996 that ``high schools continue to go
about their business in ways that sometimes bear startling
resemblance to the flawed practices of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   And, like the high school bloodletting in films like ``Carrie''
or ``Heathers'' or the savage Darwinian hierarchy portrayed in
films like ``Jawbreaker,'' ``Varsity Blues'' or ``Cruel
Intentions,'' the images our culture presents of high school life
are so routinely destructive as to prompt warning flags that go
beyond spasms of horrific violence like Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, strutting jocks and imperious prom queens lorded over
high schools well before aggrieved teen-agers turned corridors into
killing fields.
</P>
<P>
   Writing last week in the Internet magazine Salon, social critic
Camille Paglia described clique formation in high schools as ``a
pitiless process that has remained amazingly consistent for the
past 60 years.'' She then lamented the way high schools have become
anachronisms that warehouse students in the sterile regimentation
of a world of cubical classrooms and cramped rows of seats.
</P>
<P>
   And, though some elements of high school may seem eternal,
increasingly questions are being asked about an educational model
that has remained little changed since after World War I when high
school _ rather than work _ became the norm for Americans in their
mid-teens.
</P>
<P>
   The most familiar professional critique is that despite some
attempts at smaller, more experimental programs, high schools are
too big, too impersonal and too out of touch with the youngsters in
them. That perhaps was tolerable in days of two-parent families and
close ties to churches and social organizations. It is not now.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Scales, a psychologist and senior fellow with the research
organization Search Institute, said the group's studies of 100,000
students from 6th grade through 12th found that only one in four
said they went to a school where adults and other students cared
about them.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Breaking Ranks'' report, for example, called for smaller
high schools or bigger ones broken down into ``houses'' or
``teams'' of no more than 600 students to create more intimate
environments, and an adult advocate responsible for each student.
Others call for team teaching arrangements that enable groups of
teachers to monitor individual students and teaching plans that
allow teachers to follow students from year to year.
</P>
<P>
   Littleton was a 1,950-student school. Grades were not broken
down into smaller groupings, and the school was organized along
largely traditional lines.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Breaking Ranks'' recommendations are more common in middle
schools than high schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear the principal and the others talking about what a
wonderful school Columbine is,'' said Frank Smith, a professor of
educational administration at Teachers College of Columbia
University. ``But what it means is a wonderful traditional model
and a very expensive physical facility. In many ways, it's a
wonderful version of an outdated school.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Katz, a writer on new technologies, whose Web site has
attracted 4,000 posts in recent days from self-styled outsiders
terrified that the main effect of Littleton will be an effort to
further marginalize the marginalized, said what has most changed
the social dynamic of high school is technology.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's high school outcasts, he said, were truly powerless.
But youngsters drawn to the Internet and to the electronic culture
of violent games like Tribe, Doom and Quake find a life outside
high school that is exciting, engaging and intellectually
stimulating, where they have friends, community and power. Only in
school are they back at the mercy of the old kings and queens and a
world of teachers talking at them while they sit in cramped desks
just as students did when the radio was high-tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of school, these kids are empowered and stimulated,''
he said. ``And school then becomes a nightmare, dull and
claustrophobic and oppressive, where you have kids constantly
dumping on them for being different. These are not violent kids.
You look at the numbers, and it's absurd to say that. But what's
happening is making them very alienated and very angry.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution, he says, is for schools to recognize and respect
the world of the online subculture with, for example, a gaming club
supported the way sports are, and more use of technology and less
traditional and more interactive teaching styles.

</P>
<P>
   Others, most notably Bard College president Leon Botstein, say
the solution is not to make high school better, but to to get rid
of it. In his ``Jefferson's Children: Education and the Promise of
American Culture'' (Doubleday, 1997), he argued that children grow
up physically and mentally so much faster now that high schools
trap adolescents in an unreal, age-limited world of silly ritual
and mediocre education.
</P>
<P>
   ``High schools are outdated, obsolete and devastatingly
wrong-headed solutions to the education of adolescents,'' he said.
``We trap them in a world of jock values and anti-intellectualism,
like trying to cram a large person into a small childish uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he proposes that students graduate at the age of 15 or
16 and go to junior colleges, colleges, new institutions like
science or vocational academies or work.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the issues are not limited to high school.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Comer, a Yale University psychiatrist, has been saying
for years that schools only address the intellectual needs of
children and not their psychological and developmental ones. The
current wave of school reform, with its relentless reliance on
standardized test results, only makes things worse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he added that it is hard to single out high schools for
being status obsessed, hierarchical and savagely competitive when
that describes the world outside as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the culture outside the school, we like winners and
losers,'' he said. ``Look at pro athletes. We even like it when the
winners stick it in the face of the losers.''
</P>
<P>
   In that sense high school may be so scarring because it is
students' first intense dose of the world to come. But Botstein
argues that at least in the world outside people can choose where
to eat or what work to do. In high school, he said, they are all
stuck in ``an artificial exaggeration of the worst values of our
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most students' reaction to Littleton was not to
criticize the school, but to lament the destruction of a place they
loved. It is clear, though, that for those at the bottom, the
stresses and hurts are worse than ever.
</P>
<P>
   On the electronic message board that the local school district
put up on the Internet in the wake of the shooting, one 1997
Columbine graduate wrote of the taunting she faced in school and
how much time her mother spent at Columbine ``trying to find
someone who cared about me.''
</P>
<P>
   She concluded: ``I will be very disgusted if the administrators
find that the solution to the problem is to hire more security
guards. Hiring more security guards will only limit the means by
which kids can harm each other.''

CHINESE COMMUNISTS SAY THE PARTY ISN'T OVER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ That the Communist Party is losing touch with the
masses is an open worry to leaders here. The latest shock to the
system came last week with the sudden demonstration by the
spiritual cult called Buddhist Law, a movement claiming tens of
millions of Chinese members. So what is party chief Jiang Zemin
doing to create a more relevant Communist Party for the 21st
century?
</P>
<P>
   Old habits, it seems, die hard: Jiang's top aides have been busy
mounting an old-fashioned ``rectification'' campaign to promote
ideological conformity among the millions of cadres who purportedly
run the country, to re-invigorate the party and, not incidentally,
to assure Jiang a place in history.
</P>
<P>
   The Three Stresses campaign, as it is known, is being waged in
party offices, government agencies and the army. The senior ranks
at universities, research centers and publishing houses are next.
Under the command to ``stress study, stress politics and stress
rectitude,'' officials are required to read specially prepared
textbooks including works by Mao Tse-tung, Deng Xiaoping and, of
course, Jiang.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt officials will read and reread Jiang's speeches, which
are filled with abstruse rationalizations for economic reforms as
well as demands for social stability and party unity. A typical
Jiangism: ``Unwaveringly upholding the party's general line
requires properly handling the relationship between reform,
development and stability at all times.'' Such words hold the key,
or so officials hope, to discerning the proper line in a confusing
period.
</P>
<P>
   Over a period of weeks, high officials in a given workplace must
participate in group discussions and write critiques of their own
errors in thought and deed _ whether they have put the interests of
the party ahead of personal gain. They are also instructed to write
anonymous critiques of their organizations and bosses for use in
additional group sessions.
</P>
<P>
   But even if party discipline improves, it is unclear how the
change will help China's rulers govern an increasingly diverse and
demanding society. Officials seemed bewildered by the giant
demonstration by the Buddhist Law movement, which wants official
acceptance, not Communist regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang's campaign lacks the ferocity of drives dating from the
1940s, and participants describe the sessions as boring. But he is
using traditional methods to corral wayward cadres that are prone
to corruption and ideological wandering. According to a retired
official, he also hopes to identify loyal, promising officials for
future leadership positions.
</P>
<P>
   With 21 traveling inspection teams monitoring compliance, the
Three Stresses campaign is going national. Supervising them is Vice
President Hu Jintao, who appears to be Jiang's favored successor if
he retires from party leadership as expected in 2002, and Zeng
Qinghong, Jiang's close adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang has shown every sign that he aspires to enter the pantheon
of great Communist philosopher-leaders like Mao and Deng. Among
other things, three times in recent weeks he has had his
calligraphy printed, Mao-style, on the front page of the People's
Daily _ something he would never have dared to do a few years ago
when his status was less secure.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang was widely dismissed as a caretaker when Deng installed
him as party chief in 1989, after the traumatic crushing of mass
protests in Tiananmen Square. But he seems to want credit as a
masterful contributor to the progress of the party and its guiding
thought _ the ``third generation'' titan whose essays and speeches
will find a place alongside Mao Tse-tung Thought and Deng Xiaoping
Theory.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang's aides are now at work compiling his speeches and
writings, possibly in time for October's celebration of the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.

 UNDATED: teaching styles.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Others, most notably Bard College president Leon Botstein, say
the solution is not to make high school better, but to to get rid
of it. In his ``Jefferson's Children: Education and the Promise of
American Culture'' (Doubleday, 1997), he argued that children grow
up physically and mentally so much faster now that high schools
trap adolescents in an unreal, age-limited world of silly ritual
and mediocre education.
</P>
<P>
   ``High schools are outdated, obsolete and devastatingly
wrong-headed solutions to the education of adolescents,'' he said.
``We trap them in a world of jock values and anti-intellectualism,
like trying to cram a large person into a small childish uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he proposes that students graduate at the age of 15 or
16 and go to junior colleges, colleges, new institutions like
science or vocational academies or work.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the issues are not limited to high school.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Comer, a Yale University psychiatrist, has been saying
for years that schools only address the intellectual needs of
children and not their psychological and developmental ones. The
current wave of school reform, with its relentless reliance on
standardized test results, only makes things worse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he added that it is hard to single out high schools for
being status obsessed, hierarchical and savagely competitive when
that describes the world outside as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the culture outside the school, we like winners and
losers,'' he said. ``Look at pro athletes. We even like it when the
winners stick it in the face of the losers.''
</P>
<P>
   In that sense high school may be so scarring because it is
students' first intense dose of the world to come. But Botstein
argues that at least in the world outside people can choose where
to eat or what work to do. In high school, he said, they are all
stuck in ``an artificial exaggeration of the worst values of our
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most students' reaction to Littleton was not to
criticize the school, but to lament the destruction of a place they
loved. It is clear, though, that for those at the bottom, the
stresses and hurts are worse than ever.
</P>
<P>
   On the electronic message board that the local school district
put up on the Internet in the wake of the shooting, one 1997
Columbine graduate wrote of the taunting she faced in school and
how much time her mother spent at Columbine ``trying to find
someone who cared about me.''
</P>
<P>
   She concluded: ``I will be very disgusted if the administrators
find that the solution to the problem is to hire more security
guards. Hiring more security guards will only limit the means by
which kids can harm each other.''

CHINESE COMMUNISTS SAY THE PARTY ISN'T OVER

<P>
   BEIJING _ That the Communist Party is losing touch with the
masses is an open worry to leaders here. The latest shock to the
system came last week with the sudden demonstration by the
spiritual cult called Buddhist Law, a movement claiming tens of
millions of Chinese members. So what is party chief Jiang Zemin
doing to create a more relevant Communist Party for the 21st
century?
</P>
<P>
   Old habits, it seems, die hard: Jiang's top aides have been busy
mounting an old-fashioned ``rectification'' campaign to promote
ideological conformity among the millions of cadres who purportedly
run the country, to re-invigorate the party and, not incidentally,
to assure Jiang a place in history.
</P>
<P>
   The Three Stresses campaign, as it is known, is being waged in
party offices, government agencies and the army. The senior ranks
at universities, research centers and publishing houses are next.
Under the command to ``stress study, stress politics and stress
rectitude,'' officials are required to read specially prepared
textbooks including works by Mao Tse-tung, Deng Xiaoping and, of
course, Jiang.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt officials will read and reread Jiang's speeches, which
are filled with abstruse rationalizations for economic reforms as
well as demands for social stability and party unity. A typical
Jiangism: ``Unwaveringly upholding the party's general line
requires properly handling the relationship between reform,
development and stability at all times.'' Such words hold the key,
or so officials hope, to discerning the proper line in a confusing
period.
</P>
<P>
   Over a period of weeks, high officials in a given workplace must
participate in group discussions and write critiques of their own
errors in thought and deed _ whether they have put the interests of
the party ahead of personal gain. They are also instructed to write
anonymous critiques of their organizations and bosses for use in
additional group sessions.
</P>
<P>
   But even if party discipline improves, it is unclear how the
change will help China's rulers govern an increasingly diverse and
demanding society. Officials seemed bewildered by the giant
demonstration by the Buddhist Law movement, which wants official
acceptance, not Communist regulation.
</P>
<P>

WHEN IDEOLOGY GOES WHERE ACTUARIES TREAD

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As legislation, the plan to overhaul the Social
Security system announced last week by two influential Republican
congressmen is going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders have concluded that their party cannot touch
Social Security without getting burned politically, and they have
made clear that they have no intention of allowing any Republican
legislation making fundamental changes in the popular retirement
system to come to a vote before the next election.
</P>
<P>
   But as a case study in politics and the development of
government policy, the new Social Security plan belongs in the
textbooks. It shows how when politicians dig beneath the surface of
a complicated topic, they often learn that their ideological
preconceptions are unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, particularly the most conservative ones, have never
much liked Social Security. Their feel the country would be better
off if the government's role in the pension system were minimal and
if workers could invest their retirement money at will in the
financial markets, draw benefits based on how well their
investments performed, and pass on to their heirs what was left of
their retirement savings when they died.
</P>
<P>
   So when the main Republican entry in the Social Security reform
sweepstakes was announced last week, many in the party who had not
been involved in its preparation were flabbergasted. Far from the
free-market approach that most Republicans say they favor, the
measure would strictly limit private investments, pay the same
benefits to retirees no matter where they invested their money and
leave nothing at retirees' death that could be willed to the next
generation.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was lambasted by the conservative policy purveyors at
the Heritage Foundation and the Cato Institute and denounced by
many Republicans in Congress. ``I could never support anything like
that,'' said Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, a committed conservative who
is chairman of the Budget Committee and a long-shot candidate for
the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The chief sponsors of the plan _ Reps. Bill Archer, R-Texas,
chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and E. Clay Shaw Jr.,
R-Fla., chairman of the Social Security subcommittee, both
conservatives to the core _ almost seemed surprised at the way
their proposal had turned out.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how it would work: The government would give workers
money through tax rebates and require them to invest it in private
retirement accounts. So far so good, from the conservative
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   But get this: The measure would also require that the
investments be precisely 60 percent in stock index funds and 40
percent in corporate bonds. When workers retire, they would have to
give their retirement accounts to the government, which would
convert the money into financial instruments called annuities that
would pay retirees a fixed monthly sum for the rest of their lives
and expire when they died. Workers would be guaranteed that their
monthly check would be at least as large as what they would get
under the current Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   This means workers would have nothing from the accounts to leave
to their heirs unless they and their spouse died before either
retired. And because the monthly payment retirees would be entitled
to under Social Security would almost always be larger than what
they would receive from their annuity alone, retirees' benefits in
practice would be the same no matter how the investments they had
made during their working lives had performed.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he had included such rigid government controls in his
plan, given his predilection for an investment-based approach to
Social Security, Shaw replied, ``There is no other way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Suppose Archer and Shaw had not mandated that investments be
exactly 60 percent in stocks and 40 percent in bonds. Then workers
might as well put their money in the riskiest ventures imaginable.
After all, their retirement benefits would be guaranteed if the
investment failed. In such a situation, the Social Security
actuaries would not have certified, as they did last week, that the
Republican plan would preserve the solvency of the system for the
next 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   What if the plan did not require workers to surrender their
accounts for annuities when they retired? Then long-lived people
might exhaust their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to be absolutely certain that no one, no one in
America, would become a ward of the state when they got old,''
Archer said. ``What became very clear as we went along was that as
long as the government is providing the money, it doesn't work
without government standards.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the Republican dream of turning Social Security into
a mostly private system. Like countless other radical departures
(communism in Europe; Prohibition in the United States),
privatization of Social Security turns out under scrutiny to have
more drawbacks than benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what keeps those of us who study policy in business,''
said Donald Kettl, a political science professor at the University
of Wisconsin. ``Policy is almost always more complicated than what
it looks like in the headlines. If you worry about the mechanics,
then you lose the headlines,'' Kettl continued. ``And if you lose
the headlines, then you lose support.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the lesson of Bill Archer and Clay Shaw.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bettye Travis is 5 feet 5 and weighs 300 pounds. So
when the National Institutes of Health broadened its definition of
overweight last year using a gauge called body mass index, Ms.
Travis, 47, the proprietor of a cake- and candy-making supply store
in San Francisco, didn't bother to calculate hers. She said she
didn't need the government to tell her she weighs too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fat all my life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of other people are fat, too, it turns out. By the
government's new definitions, more than one-half of all Americans
aged 20 to 74 are overweight and one-fifth fall into a new
category: obese.
</P>
<P>
   To Ms. Travis, a board member of the National Association to
Advance Fat Acceptance, the expanded definitions are another
example of the way this thin-obsessed nation has turned love
handles into a medical condition.
</P>
<P>
   But to the pharmaceutical industry, the corpulence of America
means something else entirely: a booming new market for diet pills
for the obese, practically served to the companies on a silver
platter by the government.
</P>
<P>
   That was evident last week when Hoffman-LaRoche, one of the
world's biggest drug makers, received approval from the Food and
Drug Administration to sell Xenical, the first in a new class of
anti-obesity medications that work by blocking the body's
absorption of dietary fat. It is the first pill to be approved
since the government recalibrated its definition of who qualifies
as overweight.
</P>
<P>
   The new standard relies on body mass index, which experts say
provides a better measurement of body fat than the traditional
height and weight charts. Until last year, men were overweight if
their body mass index was 27.3 or higher; for women, the cut-off
was 27.8. Today, anyone with a body mass index of 25 or higher is
overweight, by government standards. And a new category, obese, has
been added for those whose index is 30 or above. (For the record,
Ms. Travis' body mass index is about 50.)
</P>
<P>
   The government did not pick those numbers out of a hat,
nutrition experts say; studies show that people at those weights
are at an increased risk of high blood pressure, high cholesterol,
heart disease and other chronic disorders that contribute to
premature death.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts say diet and exercise _ not drugs _ are the best
solution to a weight problem. But losing weight by dieting and
exercise is not easy, and with excess body fat increasingly being
viewed as a disease, the experts say, the drug industry cannot be
blamed for putting forth a pharmacologic fix. And of course, it is
lucrative: financial analysts say the market for Xenical, which is
expected to cost about $1.10 a capsule and $100 for a month's
supply, could approach $1 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Xenical is not dramatically effective; patients taking
it in combination with a reduced diet lost eight pounds more, on
average, than those taking dummy pills.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is intended for patients with a body mass index of 30,
or an index of 27 if the patient also has conditions that are
worsened by obesity, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol or
diabetes. But doctors will be able to prescribe the drug to anyone,
and Dr. David Williamson, who studies diabetes at the Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta, said some obesity experts worry that
the government's body mass standards will prompt interest among
patients who don't really need it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that when patients advocate to their physicians that
they want a drug, physicians will prescribe it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of Xenical also fits in with the broader emergence
of drugs designed to enhance life rather than cure disease. The day
after it was approved, the new fat-blocker took its place on
Internet sites selling Viagra, the medication for impotence, and
Propecia, the pill for baldness.
</P>
<P>
   Unabashed promotion of Xenical comes as no surprise to Ms.
Travis. But, she said: ``It gives me a deep sadness. The world is a
tough enough place as it is without being told that you're fat.''

in San Francisco, didn't bother to calculate hers. She said she
didn't need the government to tell her she weighs too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fat all my life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of other people are fat, too, it turns out. By the
government's new definitions, more than one-half of all Americans
aged 20 to 74 are overweight and one-fifth fall into a new
category: obese.
</P>
<P>
   To Ms. Travis, a board member of the National Association to
Advance Fat Acceptance, the expanded definitions are another
example of the way this thin-obsessed nation has turned love
handles into a medical condition.
</P>
<P>
   But to the pharmaceutical industry, the corpulence of America
means something else entirely: a booming new market for diet pills
for the obese, practically served to the companies on a silver
platter by the government.
</P>
<P>
   That was evident last week when Hoffman-LaRoche, one of the
world's biggest drug makers, received approval from the Food and
Drug Administration to sell Xenical, the first in a new class of
anti-obesity medications that work by blocking the body's
absorption of dietary fat. It is the first pill to be approved
since the government recalibrated its definition of who qualifies
as overweight.
</P>
<P>
   The new standard relies on body mass index, which experts say
provides a better measurement of body fat than the traditional
height and weight charts. Until last year, men were overweight if
their body mass index was 27.3 or higher; for women, the cut-off
was 27.8. Today, anyone with a body mass index of 25 or higher is
overweight, by government standards. And a new category, obese, has
been added for those whose index is 30 or above. (For the record,
Ms. Travis' body mass index is about 50.)
</P>
<P>
   The government did not pick those numbers out of a hat,
nutrition experts say; studies show that people at those weights
are at an increased risk of high blood pressure, high cholesterol,
heart disease and other chronic disorders that contribute to
premature death.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts say diet and exercise _ not drugs _ are the best
solution to a weight problem. But losing weight by dieting and
exercise is not easy, and with excess body fat increasingly being
viewed as a disease, the experts say, the drug industry cannot be
blamed for putting forth a pharmacologic fix. And of course, it is
lucrative: financial analysts say the market for Xenical, which is
expected to cost about $1.10 a capsule and $100 for a month's
supply, could approach $1 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Xenical is not dramatically effective; patients taking
it in combination with a reduced diet lost eight pounds more, on
average, than those taking dummy pills.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is intended for patients with a body mass index of 30,
or an index of 27 if the patient also has conditions that are
worsened by obesity, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol or
diabetes. But doctors will be able to prescribe the drug to anyone,
and Dr. David Williamson, who studies diabetes at the Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta, said some obesity experts worry that
the government's body mass standards will prompt interest among
patients who don't really need it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that when patients advocate to their physicians that
they want a drug, physicians will prescribe it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of Xenical also fits in with the broader emergence
of drugs designed to enhance life rather than cure disease. The day
after it was approved, the new fat-blocker took its place on
Internet sites selling Viagra, the medication for impotence, and
Propecia, the pill for baldness.
</P>
<P>
   Unabashed promotion of Xenical comes as no surprise to Ms.
Travis. But, she said: ``It gives me a deep sadness. The world is a
tough enough place as it is without being told that you're fat.''

STRAINING TO SEE THE REAL RUSSIA

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Believe it: the Russians are hopping mad. For 8, 10
years now, they followed U.S. advice on how to become capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   They swallowed U.S. foreign-policy handouts urging that Russia
be ``integrated into Euro-Atlantic and global communities'' and
built into ``a modern, market-based economy.'' They gave up on
empire, cut up their missiles and ceded three of their clients to
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   And for what? More than $60 billion in new debt. A beggar,
rubber-ruble economy. A skeletal military. A short leash held tight
by the International Monetary Fund. And now, the leveling of their
one remaining friend in all Europe, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Washington came back again, beseeching Moscow to help
cut a deal to end the Kosovo crisis, and Russians wonder why. Most
of them now believe Washington gives lip service to free markets
and global partnership, but is secretly just as happy _ no, happier
_ to have Ivan face-down on the floor at last, one arm behind his
back.
</P>
<P>
   Could they be right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, no, not literally. It is easy to argue that America has
fumbled its policy of promoting a healthy, democratic Russia _
though the Russians have fumbled plenty all by themselves. Few
would make the case that, in the long run, the United States would
not benefit from a prosperous Russia that shares at least some of
its basic values.
</P>
<P>
   But there's the rub: nobody knows what Russia will be in the
long run. Russia may have lost a Cold War. But as the last eight
years have shown, it is no postwar Germany or Japan, no vanquished
foe to be occupied and rebuilt in the U.S. image. Quite the
opposite: the Russia that re-emerged from hibernation this spring
seems at times almost gleefully anti-American and, yearning for
empire, is considering new unions with Belarus and Yugoslavia
itself.
</P>
<P>
   If Russia is the country it seemed to be for 10 years after the
fall of communism _ a nation struggling to grow into a modern
democracy _ then the West has a long-term stake in its success. But
if the real Russia is instead the seething fury visible on the
nightly news, the glory-mongering defender of murderous
hypernationalism, then its success looms fearsomely as a threat.
</P>
<P>
   So the United States thinks of Russia mostly in the short run.
And even in the short run, it's not easy to noodle out whether U.S.
interests are best served by a Russia that is robust, or one that
is weak. For undeniably, Russia's current sallow state has given
the United States license to act in ways that would have been
unthinkable a decade ago, when two superpowers bestrode the world.
</P>
<P>
   The steady drip-drip of bombing runs by U.S. jets over Iraq
would be far riskier were Russia able to bolster its old ally,
Saddam Hussein, or wield more clout in the United Nations Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's decline has shifted the balance of power further toward
America in the Middle East. It has opened potentially strategic oil
deposits in Russia's Caspian Sea backyard to U.S. companies, and
spawned a game of pipeline-building politics in which the effect of
U.S. policy _ and even perhaps the intent _ is to weaken Russia's
influence with other members of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend's declaration by NATO that the alliance had
broadened its mission to battling proliferation and genocide
outside its borders would have been impossible were Russia a force
in world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Russians complain bitterly, they acquiesced to
NATO's absorption of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic this
year only after being assured that the alliance was fundamentally
defensive _ and that Russia would have a voice, if not a veto, in
its policies.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia, of course, is the marquee example, the epitome of
the U.S. policy conundrum _ and the sum of all Russia's fears. Does
a weak Russia serve U.S. interests? Absolutely. Russians are
furious over NATO's decision to intervene in what they see as a
civil war. They are even more furious over Washington's turning a
deaf ear to their objections _ indeed, over the decision to
authorize bombing as Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov was crossing
the Atlantic to meet President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But would a stronger Russia serve U.S. interests? The United
States seems to believe so; bogged down after 40 days of bombing,
Washington and its NATO allies have embraced Moscow as the best
hope for getting the Yugoslav strong man Slobodan Milosevic to the
bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   Russians are exquisitely sensitive to the contrast. Western
leaders support Russia's mediation of the crisis ``for a very
simple reason _ they want to convince Russia to put pressure on
Milosevic to make him accept NATO's ultimatum, in order to stop the
military action and say that NATO has won,'' said Alexei Arbatov,
the deputy chairman of the defense committee in Russia's lower
house of parliament, at a seminar last week. ``This is not a
request for Russia to facilitate the peace process. This is
pressure on Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   From the U.S. perspective, ignoring a weakened Russia now seems
cost-free. Sure, Moscow still has 7,000 nuclear warheads, but
nobody thinks that even the craziest Russian nationalist is about
to fire them. But there's a long run in Russia, too, and a Moscow
that sees the United States as an its enemy can play some cards,
from weapons proliferation to cozying up to China. Nor can anyone
assume that Russia, with more oil than anyplace, will always be a
beggar.

<P>
   Dmitri Simes, a leading scholar of Russia who is president of
the Nixon Institute, a Washington-based foreign policy research
organization, says he understands why Moscow feels used. In his
view, the United States sincerely wanted to enlist Russia as a
strategic partner, but its decision to hang its entire policy on
President Boris Yeltsin and his team of reformers _ even as Yeltsin
became more autocratic and unpopular and the reforms were eaten
away by corruption _ left precisely the opposite impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when these individuals and those policies all collapsed in
August of '98,'' Simes said, ``I think the administration found
itself without a policy _ with a lot of frustration, with an
absence of new ideas and, if you wish, a perverse sense of
satisfaction that if Russia didn't quite live up to the
administration's expectations, at a minimum they were in such a
mess that they didn't have to take them seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Russians have sensed that on a variety of issues _
Iraq, Kosovo, arms transfers, Caspian pipelines. On all those
issues, the administration is talking about partnership, but in
each case its idea of partnership is that Russia would walk in
lockstep with administration policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Militarily and politically enfeebled, Russia has swallowed hard
and accepted U.S. policy on many of those issues _ even in Kosovo,
where Russia basically supported United States positions in the
United Nations. But on the other hand, Simes said, ``there's a
difference between impotence and acceptance of American policies.''
</P>
<P>
   It is with Yugoslavia that that difference, long concealed under
a veneer of Russian-U.S. cooperation, has burst into view.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a clash of civilizations,'' said Alexei Podberezkin,
the deputy chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the Russian
parliament's lower house, last week. ``They offer us an aggressive
and virtually Protestant model of democracy _ no, they impose it on
us. What is happening in Yugoslavia and what happened in Bosnia and
Croatia is an attempt to impose the Western understanding of
values, including democratic ones. But Russia may have other values
_ cultural, historical and democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonid Dobrokhotov, a former aide at the Communist Party Central
Committee in the 1980s and now an adviser to party chairman Gennadi
Zyuganov, put it more elegantly in an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of the actions in Yugoslavia, we've again found
our natural enemy,'' he said. ``The problem isn't Milosevic. This
is a geopolitical problem.''
</P>
<P>
   More and more Russians agree, which underscores one of the
dangers of short-run policies: strung end to end, they become the
long run. Some Russians now argue _ and Simes said he fears _ that
with Yugoslavia, U.S. policy toward Russia may have crossed that
divide.

WHEN ALLIES ARE FIERCE COMPETITORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Late in the day on April 6, Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson showed up at the White House with some bad news for
President Clinton: The leakage of nuclear secrets from U.S. weapons
labs was far worse than anyone thought. The Chinese _ whose prime
minister was on his way to Washington _ may have obtained computer
codes that are the key ingredient for simulating nuclear weapons
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of chilling discovery that would make for a good
Washington thriller. But real life is more complex. In a speech the
next morning, Clinton said Americans do indeed have reason to worry
about China, but not only a muscular China with the latest weapons
technology. Americans have as much to fear, he argued, from a weak
China whose ailing banks and bankrupt enterprises could undermine
the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we've learned anything in the last few years from Japan's
long recession and Russia's current economic troubles, it is that
the weaknesses of great nations can pose as big a challenge to
America as their strengths,'' Clinton said. ``So as we focus on the
potential challenge that a strong China could present to the United
States in the future, let us not forget the risk of a weak China,
beset by internal conflicts, social dislocation and criminal
activity, becoming a vast zone of instability in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the starkest moment yet in what has emerged as the
central foreign policy conundrum in Washington: In an age when your
military adversary can also rank among your biggest trading
partners, and when your military allies double as your fiercest
economic competitors, does America want weak global neighbors or
strong ones?
</P>
<P>
   That question is increasingly the subtext of daily debate in
Washington, fracturing the Democratic and Republican parties across
unusual lines, trapping lawmakers and pundits in circular arguments
about where America's true interests lie. It helps account for the
crazy-quilt of U.S. foreign policy. And the problem is made more
complex by the fact that the world stage is crowded by weak states
_ countries that are jockeying for global influence while
struggling to keep from drowning in debt, self-doubt and rising
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese, once masters of the art of converting
old-fashioned capital into political capital, have watched their
global influence decline faster than the price of an office
building in the Ginza. While Russia tries to flex old muscles in
the Balkans, it is submitting to the humiliation of having the
International Monetary Fund micro-manage its economy. (Last week,
spurred by fears that Moscow is feeling dangerously alienated from
the West, the IMF finally committed to $4.5 billion in new loans
for the nearly insolvent government, just enough to stave off
national default for another year or so.)
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese spies who may be tinkering with the nuclear codes
are probably thankful for the fact that, unlike millions of others
who toil for the state, their jobs are going to be around for a
while. And then there are the Europeans, who are slogging through a
war in Yugoslavia just at the moment that their economies are
slowing and their new currency, the Euro, has fallen 10 percent.
This was supposed to be the year the continent focused on becoming
the next great economic superpower, linked by a single currency and
a huge market. Instead, one European finance minister visiting
Washington last week moaned, ``We're spending all our political
energy on a 600-year-old problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extraordinary moment that perhaps we haven't seen
since the '20s, or at least since the days of the Marshall Plan,''
said Kenneth Courtis, the chief Asian economist for Deutsche Bank.
``You have the world economy flying on one engine _ the United
States. And almost everyone else is dealing from a weak hand.''
</P>
<P>
   You would think this would leave Washington filled with joy, and
often it does. After all, that single engine still has its
afterburners lit: The government reported Friday an astounding 4.5
percent annual growth rate in the first quarter, once again beating
virtually every forecast. It's hard to imagine any country
threatening America's sole-superpower status for decades. It's even
harder to recall that only a decade ago Washington was still
preoccupied with Japan's buying spree in Hollywood and on Wall
Street, and wringing its hands about the successes of Asian-style
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   But the celebration of U.S. supremacy sometimes obscures the far
more complex risks of managing world affairs amid global economic
and political fragility. And the truth is that Washington is still
a lot more comfortable containing an easily identifiable enemy than
managing a system where cracks on one side of the globe can radiate
to the other.
</P>
<P>

them. ``Now the fear about Russia is that nothing is under anyone's
clear control _ not the taxation system and not the
atomic-industrial complex.''

WHEN ALLIES ARE FIERCE COMPETITORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Late in the day on April 6, Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson showed up at the White House with some bad news for
President Clinton: The leakage of nuclear secrets from U.S. weapons
labs was far worse than anyone thought. The Chinese _ whose prime
minister was on his way to Washington _ may have obtained computer
codes that are the key ingredient for simulating nuclear weapons
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of chilling discovery that would make for a good
Washington thriller. But real life is more complex. In a speech the
next morning, Clinton said Americans do indeed have reason to worry
about China, but not only a muscular China with the latest weapons
technology. Americans have as much to fear, he argued, from a weak
China whose ailing banks and bankrupt enterprises could undermine
the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we've learned anything in the last few years from Japan's
long recession and Russia's current economic troubles, it is that
the weaknesses of great nations can pose as big a challenge to
America as their strengths,'' Clinton said. ``So as we focus on the
potential challenge that a strong China could present to the United
States in the future, let us not forget the risk of a weak China,
beset by internal conflicts, social dislocation and criminal
activity, becoming a vast zone of instability in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the starkest moment yet in what has emerged as the
central foreign policy conundrum in Washington: In an age when your
military adversary can also rank among your biggest trading
partners, and when your military allies double as your fiercest
economic competitors, does America want weak global neighbors or
strong ones?
</P>
<P>
   That question is increasingly the subtext of daily debate in
Washington, fracturing the Democratic and Republican parties across
unusual lines, trapping lawmakers and pundits in circular arguments
about where America's true interests lie. It helps account for the
crazy-quilt of U.S. foreign policy. And the problem is made more
complex by the fact that the world stage is crowded by weak states
_ countries that are jockeying for global influence while
struggling to keep from drowning in debt, self-doubt and rising
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese, once masters of the art of converting
old-fashioned capital into political capital, have watched their
global influence decline faster than the price of an office
building in the Ginza. While Russia tries to flex old muscles in
the Balkans, it is submitting to the humiliation of having the
International Monetary Fund micro-manage its economy. (Last week,
spurred by fears that Moscow is feeling dangerously alienated from
the West, the IMF finally committed to $4.5 billion in new loans
for the nearly insolvent government, just enough to stave off
national default for another year or so.)
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese spies who may be tinkering with the nuclear codes
are probably thankful for the fact that, unlike millions of others
who toil for the state, their jobs are going to be around for a
while. And then there are the Europeans, who are slogging through a
war in Yugoslavia just at the moment that their economies are
slowing and their new currency, the Euro, has fallen 10 percent.
This was supposed to be the year the continent focused on becoming
the next great economic superpower, linked by a single currency and
a huge market. Instead, one European finance minister visiting
Washington last week moaned, ``We're spending all our political
energy on a 600-year-old problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extraordinary moment that perhaps we haven't seen
since the '20s, or at least since the days of the Marshall Plan,''
said Kenneth Courtis, the chief Asian economist for Deutsche Bank.
``You have the world economy flying on one engine _ the United
States. And almost everyone else is dealing from a weak hand.''
</P>
<P>
   You would think this would leave Washington filled with joy, and
often it does. After all, that single engine still has its
afterburners lit: The government reported Friday an astounding 4.5
percent annual growth rate in the first quarter, once again beating
virtually every forecast. It's hard to imagine any country
threatening America's sole-superpower status for decades. It's even
harder to recall that only a decade ago Washington was still
preoccupied with Japan's buying spree in Hollywood and on Wall
Street, and wringing its hands about the successes of Asian-style
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   But the celebration of U.S. supremacy sometimes obscures the far
more complex risks of managing world affairs amid global economic
and political fragility. And the truth is that Washington is still
a lot more comfortable containing an easily identifiable enemy than
managing a system where cracks on one side of the globe can radiate
to the other.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that weakness comes in many forms. There
is Russian-style weakness, an inability of the state machinery to
make the country function, to keep control. Whatever temporary
pleasure Americans derived from watching the Russian military
threat fall apart has been tempered by the fear that economic chaos
has put its nuclear expertise up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the Cold War we knew that Russia's nukes were under
strict control, but we were terrified of the people controlling
them,'' said Michael Mandelbaum, a Johns Hopkins University
professor who has written about the new challenges of managing a
global system in which leaders are overwhelmed by the forces around
them. ``Now the fear about Russia is that nothing is under anyone's
clear control _ not the taxation system and not the
atomic-industrial complex.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Japanese-style weakness, a subject President
Clinton will be carefully dancing around Monday as Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi arrives for an official visit. In Tokyo the problem
isn't a collapsing state; it's a chronic inability to get political
consensus, whether the issue is bolstering security in Asia or
remaking the world's second-largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi will be arriving with the news that the lower house of
Parliament has finally passed legislation that would allow it, in
theory, to act like a real ally of U.S. forces should a military
emergency break out in the Pacific. But the bill was stripped of
several key elements, including one that would let Tokyo
participate in enforcing international sanctions, and the Pentagon
still fears that if North Korea lashes out, Japan may sit on its
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Of more immediate concern is whether Japan's seven-year
recession is finally ending, as the Japanese insist. If not,
Japan's troubles could choke off Asia's fragile recovery and force
the United States to continue taking in a wildly disproportionate
amount of the world's exports. Sooner or later, that will cost
American jobs, which is why Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin warned
again last week that America's soaring trade deficits are ``not
politically sustainable.'' But in Japan's case, as in Russia's,
Washington has few levers to pull.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Washington is never quite sure with whom it should be
negotiating. Obuchi has scant control over the pace of Japanese
reforms. That power is in the hands of the country's scared
corporate heads, its much-criticized bureaucrats and its workers,
who are terrified by the rising unemployment rate and know that
they have few options if they lose their job.
</P>
<P>
   If Boris Yeltsin was once committed to reforming the Russian
economy, he has given it up. It is notable that ever since Russia's
currency devaluation and default on some of its debt last August,
the Clinton administration has cut back on providing free advice
about the wonders of making the transition to a market economy.
``It would only stoke their resentments further,'' one senior State
Department official said. ``We're wiser to shut up about reform.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least there is some agreement in Washington that a
stronger Japan and an economically stable Russia are in the
country's interests. Raise the subject of China, and it's a
different story. On Capitol Hill these days, China is once again a
power to be contained.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations of nuclear espionage bolster the arguments of
conservatives who say the Clinton administration has been blinded
by big business and big donors, and that it buried the evidence of
transgressions at Los Alamos because they threatened the policy of
engagement. Add their voices to those of human rights groups who
are horrified by China's recent crackdowns, unions that fear trade
deals, and Taiwan supporters who want more protection from the
mainland's missiles.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum are Clinton and many of
America's China experts, who see 100 million jobless wandering the
Chinese countryside, failing state-owned enterprises and insolvent
banks that _ at the government's insistence _ keep those
enterprises afloat. And there are Russia-like symptoms: arms
proliferation, the rising power of organized crime, a military in
business for itself.
</P>
<P>
   The theory of integrating China into the World Trade
Organization _ the deal Clinton walked away from earlier this month
_ is that it would help the Chinese pull off the feat that the
Russians couldn't. It would force China to deal in a Western legal
system, to open up, to let a billion Web users bloom.
</P>
<P>
   A nice theory, but the reality is that Washington wants China,
like Russia, to be strong on Washington's terms. Washington wants
to encourage Chinese economic strength and discourage military
strength; it wants nations to independently find their own way to a
market economy _ as long as it runs strictly according to Western
rules.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Washington wants strong economies run by leaders who
will shrink their military power and act weakly beyond their
borders. But Washington is not likely to get what it wants.

ONLY CONGRESS CAN DECLARE WAR, BUT IT ALMOST NEVER HAS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was the bombing of Cambodia and the national
anguish over Vietnam that spurred Congress, over Richard M. Nixon's
veto, to enact a law that it hoped would prevent any other
president from waging undeclared war.
</P>
<P>
   The War Powers Resolution of 1973 was a masterpiece of deadlines
and trip wires, all carefully constructed to keep a president in
check. It called for consultation with Congress in matters of war.
It required the commander in chief to notify Congress quickly when
U.S. troops were being sent to face possible hostilities. And it
said troops had to be removed from foreign territory within 60 to
90 days unless Congress explicitly approved their mission.
</P>
<P>
   But the law could do nothing to change the essential nature of
Congress. Lawmakers rarely like to take an assertive stance on war
_ and most particularly not before the chances of success or the
poll ratings become clear. If anyone wanted proof of this it came
last week when Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., ignored the entreaties
of the House leadership and used the Vietnam-era legislation to
force the House to take a stand on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The result? A philosophical muddle devoid of practical effect.
</P>
<P>
   The House refused to declare war. It would not ratify the
bombing already underway against Yugoslavia. Nor would it pull out
the troops in order to stop the bombing. Then it demanded the right
to vote again before President Clinton could widen the conflict to
ground troops. The next day, a House committee proposed to give the
president more than twice as much money as he wanted for the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The signals being sent around the world are confusing,'' said
Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga. House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt
fumed that the House action was a ``low moment in American foreign
policy and the history of this institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Debate over how the president and Congress should share power in
matters of war is as old as the Republic. Presidents have sent
forces abroad more than 100 times; Congress has declared war only
five times: the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, the
Spanish-American War, World War I and World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Article II of the Constitution makes the president commander in
chief. But Article I puts responsibility for declaring war solely
in congressional hands, and Congress, most notably in 1973, has
spasmodically tried to keep it there. But in practice, it has long
been content to cede most of that authority to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Congress' war powers were rarely seriously challenged until this
century. But the nuclear age and the Cold War led presidents to
assume more power. In 1950, Harry S. Truman found a new way to
side-step Congress: he used United Nations resolutions instead of a
declaration of war by Congress to send troops to Korea.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for the past quarter of a century presidents and
Congress have almost seemed to conspire to find ways around the war
powers law.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents, after all, have never conceded that the law is
constitutional. And Congress, for fear of being accused of giving
aid and comfort to the enemy, has always shied away from pulling
back troops once confronted with a fait accompli by a president.
``Even though the law is still on the books it has basically been
ignored,'' said Peter Spiro, an associate professor at Hofstra
University Law School.
</P>
<P>
   So, for example, presidents have used semantic tricks to
minimize the role of Congress in military engagements and get
around the deadlines for congressional ratification. Troops are
sent into foreign conflicts that presidents insist are not
``hostilities'' under the definition of the war powers law.
Presidents assert they have satisfied the requirement to
``consult'' Congress by informing a select circle of Congressional
leaders of actions already underway.
</P>
<P>
   President Reagan told Congress of the invasion of Grenada two
hours after he had ordered the landing. He told congressional
leaders of the bombing of Libya while the aircraft were on their
way. And he did not report formally to Congress when he increased
the number of military advisers in El Salvador in 1981 because he
argued there was no imminent threat of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   Though Congress did vote on the Persian Gulf war, it did so only
in January 1991, just days before U.S. bombs began to fall on Iraq.
For months as half a million U.S. troops assembled in Saudi Arabia,
Congress was slow and cautious, taking little action beyond
complaining to President Bush that he needed congressional
approval. And when Clinton sent troops to Haiti, his administration
argued that no congressional approval was needed because there was
no war _ the troops had been invited.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who acknowledges ``there's a natural inclination not
to want to go on record on a controversial matter until and unless
you have to,'' believes that the war powers law may have actually
done the opposite of what its drafters intended, actively
discouraging Congress from taking stands on wars. He said
presidents and Congress often view the 90-day time limit the law
sets for a deployment without congressional approval as a grace
period during which Congress does not have to take a stand.
Afterward, with U.S. soldiers under fire, a vote against war is
politically untenable.
</P>
<P>
   Across the years, some dissident members of Congress have turned
to the courts to try to test the president's power to wage war
unilaterally. But they have been rebuffed because in each case
Congress had failed to pass a resolution ordering the president to
remove the troops.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with the House on record against declaring war in
Yugoslavia, Campbell is taking another stab at recapturing
Congress' theoretical war-making authority by seeking a court
ruling to stop U.S. participation in the air war against
Yugoslavia. He may or may not get a decision before the fighting
stops.

   BOSTON _ They seem to be the disappeared, the missing, the lost
in action of the new welfare era.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more states track down former welfare recipients to
assess how their well-being has been affected by stricter
eligibility rules and more stringent work requirements, the
question of those not accounted for looms ever larger.
</P>
<P>
   The dimensions of the question are not trivial; the group of
people neither working nor on welfare amounts to more than
one-quarter of former recipients, state officials have said in
several preliminary reports.
</P>
<P>
   And in the information wars between advocates for the poor who
contend that recent welfare changes are too harsh and state
officials who present them as working well, the ``missing''
category is becoming a weapon that both sides seek to wield.
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of the unaccounted-for: those who simply
could not be found by trackers and those who have stayed off
welfare but are not working. Not on welfare but not working either?
What, then, are they living on? How do they survive?
</P>
<P>
   When Massachusetts issued its first detailed, long-term report
on how former welfare recipients seemed to be doing in mid-April,
Claire McIntire, the state's commissioner of transitional
assistance, immediately hailed as good news its findings that a
majority were working and only about 20 percent were back on
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   But her ``very first question'' to her staff, she said last
week, was, ``What is happening to the other 25 percent?'' So she
asked researchers to get back to her about how those who were
neither working nor on welfare were getting by.
</P>
<P>
   The answer was piecemeal. Of all the households that remained
off welfare, 75 percent had an adult member working, the
researchers found. The rest could be broken down like this:
</P>
<P>
   _ Just over 6 percent were in the process of re-applying for
welfare or other assistance;
</P>
<P>
   _ About 2.5 percent were getting some form of Social Security
payment;
</P>
<P>
   _ About 12 percent had been working in recent months but were
not at the time of the survey;
</P>
<P>
   _ The remaining 5 percent or so had other explanations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not characterize them as missing,'' Ms. McIntire said.
``We know they're still around, and they have other means by which
they are supporting themselves and their families. And if they do
not, we want them to come back to us and we will help them get back
in the work force.''
</P>
<P>
   Such assertions draw vehement challenges from the advocates for
the poor who see the Massachusetts report more as cause to worry
than to rejoice. Unfamiliar with the official breakdown Ms.
McIntire had ordered internally, they had their own ideas of what
was happening with the missing 25 or 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that some have probably moved in with former
spouses and boyfriends, of whom some are probably abusing them,''
said Randy Albelda, a University of Massachusetts economist, citing
the high percentage of welfare recipients who have suffered
domestic abuse. ``Some people are probably going underground and
doing illicit and illegal activities.''
</P>
<P>
   But basically, Ms. Albelda said, ``We don't know what's happened
to people, and it's going to get worse because the people who went
back on welfare will have no welfare to go back to'' now that time
limits in Massachusetts are kicking in. ``They're our missing,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The advocates also point out that the people who could not be
found at all for the survey, or refused to answer, are likely to be
worse off than those who answered, and that respondents were likely
to be less then honest because they were told that the information
they provided could be forwarded to their case workers.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, there is a growing push to fill the holes in
the welfare puzzle. Jack Tweedie, who tracks welfare policy for the
National Conference of State Legislatures, said that, in the
simplest terms, the states made changes in their welfare programs,
their case loads dropped much faster than they had expected and the
immediate question became, ``What happened to those families?'' Two
key questions, he said, are, ``How many are working and how many
are in desperate circumstances?''
</P>
<P>
   That broad picture is now emerging. State reports have tended to
show that about two-thirds of former welfare recipients get jobs
and about one-fifth find themselves even poorer than before.
</P>
<P>
   So now, Tweedie and others said, efforts to track the families
that left welfare are getting more advanced, and officials are
beginning to ask follow-up questions about how former recipients
who have not found work are supporting themselves, and what exactly
are the barriers that keep them from getting jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, said Jan Van Vleck, a state expert on post-welfare
tracking, the latest survey asked the question, ``If you have not
identified any forms of support, could you let us know how you are
living?''
</P>
<P>
   One way many are likely to be living, Tweedie noted, is by
depending even more on family than before. A New Jersey study of
certain former recipients, he said, found that as they were leaving
welfare, 38 percent said they planned to get a job; but only about
half of those people actually did. And just 23 percent said they
would depend on family support, but then a full 47 percent actually
did.
</P>
<P>
   The worry is that such family support may not be sustainable for
long, he said, because the families that former recipients depend
on are usually poor as well.

HOLLYWOOD'S LATEST LIVE ACTION: RAGING BULLS, PART II 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ In the hierarchy of values in Hollywood, money
dominates. But no one likes to talk about it. While it's perfectly
normal to discuss marital infidelities, drug addiction, sexual
dysfunction and other intensely personal matters, money is,
curiously, not mentioned because everyone is so obsessed with it.
</P>
<P>
   But now two of the dominant players in town, Michael Eisner,
chairman of Walt Disney Co., and Jeffrey Katzenberg, who worked for
him for 10 years as chairman of Disney studios, are not only
talking about money _ they're publicly attacking each other over
it.
</P>
<P>
   Not one but two golden Hollywood rules have been broken. The
town is not only mortified but fascinated by the odd legal battle
now going on in a Century City law office as if passing a car wreck
on the 405. No one can quite believe it's happening.
</P>
<P>
   At one level, the issue is Katzenberg's contention that he's
owed at least $250 million, and perhaps double that, from Disney in
profits from projects he helped create from 1984 to 1994 including
``The Lion King,'' ``The Little Mermaid, ``Aladdin'' and ``Good
Morning, Vietnam.'' In 1994 he quit in anger when Eisner failed to
promote him to No. 2, president of Disney Co. Katzenberg went on to
found Dreamworks with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen. Disney has
acknowledged that Katzenberg deserves some bonus payment but
nothing close to the amount he's seeking.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the case pits two very rich moguls against one another
_ not exactly the stuff of high courtroom drama or even a good
movie.
</P>
<P>
   At another level, though, the Katzenberg-Eisner clash has
elements of almost Shakespearean drama. The two men, who were both
raised on Park Avenue in New York, were virtual brothers for nearly
two decades. Their fallout was personal, even destructive to
themselves. The case, said Katzenberg's lawyer, Bertram Fields, was
``about the personal animus of one man'' _ Eisner.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the case seems to be about the outsize animus of both men
toward one another, a raging hatred that has led them to break the
Hollywood code of behavior that decrees that no one talk about
money and no one hurl public abuse at each other. (Private abuse is
quite another issue.)
</P>
<P>
   Eisner and Katzenberg will, of course, survive the case and, no
matter what happens, will remain extraordinarily rich. But their
reputations, at least for the moment, are damaged by the case.
</P>
<P>
   In the first week, with Katzenberg on the stand, he was depicted
by the Disney lawyer, Louis Meisinger, as a studio executive whose
live-action films were $231 million in the red when he left the
company _ a sharp rebuke to Katzenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Disney also released letters that sought to diminish Katzenberg.
To assure his profits, Katzenberg wrote a letter that ordered
Fields to be ``an absolute killer.'' Following an acrimonious
contract negotiation in 1988, Katzenberg wrote Eisner: ``You've
been great. You've handled my crap with extraordinary patience and
understanding. I'm deeply appreciative and do love you for it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, Fields asked his client, Katzenberg, to confirm
that he received $100 million in compensation during his years at
Disney. Fields also asked if Eisner had received $1 billion during
the same period, and Katzenberg answered yes _ before retired Los
Angeles County Superior Court Judge Paul Breckenridge sustained
Meisinger's objection.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Eisner, who is scheduled to appear in court this
week, was depicted by Katzenberg and Fields as duplicitous. At the
same time Fields said that the Disney senior executive vice
president, Sanford Litvack, and Irwin Russell, a Disney board
member and Eisner's personal attorney, made misleading and false
statements about Katzenberg's contract. The three ``came up with a
story,'' said Fields. ``Each story is patently untrue. I don't say
that lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   In the clubby and highly secretive world of Hollywood's power
elite _ in which Fields himself is a member in good standing _ such
public accusations would have been unthinkable. Until now.

<P>
   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, May 2, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL-VIOLENCE-REVIEW (Undated) _ If much about the murderous
shootings in Littleton, Colo., seemed alien and bizarre, at least
one part of the story seemed familiar: the world of jocks and
nerds, preps and geeks, winners and losers that defined life at
Columbine High. The incident and others like it have been viewed
through many prisms _ guns and violence in the media, values and
parenting. But the fact that such horrors keep playing out in high
schools tracks longstanding and growing concerns about what kind of
educational and social environments they provide. By Peter
Applebome. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   FOREIGN-ECON-REVIEW (Washington) _ The central U.S.
foreign-policy conundrum: In an age when your military adversary
can also rank among your biggest trading partners, and when your
military allies double as your fiercest economic competitors, does
America want weak global neighbors or strong ones? The question
helps account for the bizarre crazy-quilt of U.S. foreign policy
these days, and is complicated by the fact that the world stage is
crowded with weak countries jockeying for global influence while
struggling with economic woes. By David E. Sanger. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-OUTLOOK-REVIEW (Moscow) _ If Russia is the country it
seemed to be for 10 years after the fall of communism _ a nation
struggling to grow into a modern democracy _ then the West has a
long-term stake in its success. But if the real Russia is instead
the seething fury visible on the nightly news, the glory-mongering
defender of murderous hypernationalism, then its success looms
fearsomely as a threat. So the U.S. thinks of Russia mostly in the
short run. By Michael Wines. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   OBESITY-DRUGS-REVIEW (Undated) _ To the pharmaceutical industry,
the corpulence of America means a booming new market for diet pills
for the obese, practically served to the companies on a silver
platter by the government. That was evident last week when
Hoffman-LaRoche received FDA approval to sell Xenical, the first
pill to be approved since the government recalibrated its
definition of who qualifies as overweight. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.
WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   WELFARE-MISSING-REVIEW (Boston) _ As states track down former
welfare recipients to assess how their well-being has been affected
by stricter eligibility rules and work requirements, the question
of those not accounted for looms ever larger. They amount to more
than one-quarter of former recipients. And in the information wars
between state officials and advocates for the poor, this `missing'
category is becoming a weapon that both sides seek to wield. By
Carey Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD-FEUD-REVIEW (Hollywood) _ In the hierarchy of values
here, money dominates. But no one likes to talk about it. While
it's normal to discuss intensely personal matters, money is not
mentioned because everyone is so obsessed with it. But now two key
players here, Disney chairman Michael Eisner and his former deputy
Jeffrey Katzenberg, are not only talking about money but they're
publicly attacking each other over it. By Bernard Weinraub.
</P>
<P>
   SOCSEC-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ As a case study in
politics and the development of government policy, the Republicans'
new Social Security plan belongs in the textbooks. It shows how
when politicians dig beneath the surface of a complicated topic,
they often learn that their ideological preconceptions are
unrealistic. By David E. Rosenbaum
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-PARTY-REVIEW (Beijing) _ Communist Party chief Jiagn Zemin
and his aides are worried that the party is losing touch with the
masses, so they are trying to create a more relevant party via an
old-fashioned `rectification' campaign to promote ideological
conformity among the millions of cadres who purportedly run the
country, to re-invigorate the party and, not incidentally, to
assure Jiang a place in history. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-DIARY-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Kosovar camps and
shantytowns that have sprung up in Albania are filled with refugees
who can tell stories of a traumatizing odyssey. Among them is the
account of Skender Vehapi, a 47-year-old farmer who left his home
with his family eight months ago.
</P>
<P>

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, May 2, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL-VIOLENCE-REVIEW (Undated) _ If much about the murderous
shootings in Littleton, Colo., seemed alien and bizarre, at least
one part of the story seemed familiar: the world of jocks and
nerds, preps and geeks, winners and losers that defined life at
Columbine High. The incident and others like it have been viewed
through many prisms _ guns and violence in the media, values and
parenting. But the fact that such horrors keep playing out in high
schools tracks longstanding and growing concerns about what kind of
educational and social environments they provide. By Peter
Applebome. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   FOREIGN-ECON-REVIEW (Washington) _ The central U.S.
foreign-policy conundrum: In an age when your military adversary
can also rank among your biggest trading partners, and when your
military allies double as your fiercest economic competitors, does
America want weak global neighbors or strong ones? The question
helps account for the bizarre crazy-quilt of U.S. foreign policy
these days, and is complicated by the fact that the world stage is
crowded with weak countries jockeying for global influence while
struggling with economic woes. By David E. Sanger. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-OUTLOOK-REVIEW (Moscow) _ If Russia is the country it
seemed to be for 10 years after the fall of communism _ a nation
struggling to grow into a modern democracy _ then the West has a
long-term stake in its success. But if the real Russia is instead
the seething fury visible on the nightly news, the glory-mongering
defender of murderous hypernationalism, then its success looms
fearsomely as a threat. So the U.S. thinks of Russia mostly in the
short run. By Michael Wines. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   OBESITY-DRUGS-REVIEW (Undated) _ To the pharmaceutical industry,
the corpulence of America means a booming new market for diet pills
for the obese, practically served to the companies on a silver
platter by the government. That was evident last week when
Hoffman-LaRoche received FDA approval to sell Xenical, the first
pill to be approved since the government recalibrated its
definition of who qualifies as overweight. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.
WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   WELFARE-MISSING-REVIEW (Boston) _ As states track down former
welfare recipients to assess how their well-being has been affected
by stricter eligibility rules and work requirements, the question
of those not accounted for looms ever larger. They amount to more
than one-quarter of former recipients. And in the information wars
between state officials and advocates for the poor, this `missing'
category is becoming a weapon that both sides seek to wield. By
Carey Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD-FEUD-REVIEW (Hollywood) _ In the hierarchy of values
here, money dominates. But no one likes to talk about it. While
it's normal to discuss intensely personal matters, money is not
mentioned because everyone is so obsessed with it. But now two key
players here, Disney chairman Michael Eisner and his former deputy
Jeffrey Katzenberg, are not only talking about money but they're
publicly attacking each other over it. By Bernard Weinraub.
</P>
<P>
   SOCSEC-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ As a case study in
politics and the development of government policy, the Republicans'
new Social Security plan belongs in the textbooks. It shows how
when politicians dig beneath the surface of a complicated topic,
they often learn that their ideological preconceptions are
unrealistic. By David E. Rosenbaum
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-PARTY-REVIEW (Beijing) _ Communist Party chief Jiagn Zemin
and his aides are worried that the party is losing touch with the
masses, so they are trying to create a more relevant party via an
old-fashioned `rectification' campaign to promote ideological
conformity among the millions of cadres who purportedly run the
country, to re-invigorate the party and, not incidentally, to
assure Jiang a place in history. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-DIARY-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Kosovar camps and
shantytowns that have sprung up in Albania are filled with refugees
who can tell stories of a traumatizing odyssey. Among them is the
account of Skender Vehapi, a 47-year-old farmer who left his home
with his family eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ANTIWAR-REVIEW (Washington) _ In the debate over NATO's
bombing of Serbia, the voice of the American anti-war movement has
not been heard to any great degree. Once it was so loud that it
helped end the Vietnam War. But it may be heard soon if the war
widens. By Irvin Molotsky.

   A Red Alert for America's Forests
</P>
<P>
   Red maples, long seen as the poor relations of the maple family,
are taking over America's Eastern forests.
</P>
<P>
   Once confined to swampy areas, red maples have gained a foothold
on drier upland soil, thanks to a decline in forest fires, which
have been suppressed during the last century. The fires used to
destroy the trees while sparing dominant species like oaks, with
their thick bark and deep, extensive root systems.
</P>
<P>
   The red maples, which can thrive under almost any set of upland
conditions, show remarkable aggressiveness and resilience, getting
the jump on other species by dropping their seeds in spring rather
than in autumn, and using chemicals in their leaves to repel gypsy
moths, which devour oaks and elms.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have found that red maple saplings today tend to
dominate the carpet of young trees and shrubs under the forest
canopy, and when existing oaks and related species like hickory die
or are cut down, the red maples will replace them.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to miss these arboreal invaders. Their foliage is
green in the summer but turns brilliant scarlet or crimson in the
fall. In the winter, the buds and many twigs are red. In the
spring, so are their flowers and the whirlybird seed pods that hang
from drooping red stems.
</P>
<P>
   If the maples succeed in driving out oaks, a variety of small
creatures, from birds to nut-eating animals to insects that live in
oak bark, will go with them. The result could be a less vibrant
ecosystem, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   One way to change the trend would be to restore fire to the
woods, as is often done today for conservation reasons. But the way
things are going, scientists say, the oaks and other species that
have dominated the region's forests for 10,000 years may one day be
lost in a sea of red.

</P>
<P>
   An Import That Japan Likes
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry. This isn't another Viagra joke.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains, though, that Viagra's wonders never cease. The
latest evidence? The pill has inspired Japanese bureaucrats to move
with, relatively speaking, lightning speed.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: the low-dose birth control pill has for years
dominated the contraceptive market in the United States and
elsewhere. Among industrial nations, only Japan failed to approve
it. The application has been languishing for a decade there _ a
molasses-like timetable that is apparently typical of the Ministry
of Health and Welfare.
</P>
<P>
   When these sober bureaucrats caught wind of Viagra, though, they
flew into action, giving it the go-ahead in a head-turning six
months.
</P>
<P>
   Could the difference have anything to do with the ministry
consisting of 198 men and 6 women? Absolutely, critics say. ``Japan
is a male-dominated society,'' said Tomoko Adachi, a Tokyo
gynecologist. ``Many Japanese women do not even want to have
Viagra.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said urologist Takaaki Minami, ``Many women who have
gone through menopause say that Viagra will be a nuisance.''
</P>
<P>
   Nuisance or no, Japanese men are jubilant. Shigeharu Kobayashi,
an insurance executive, said, ``I'm 60 years old, but I think I'm
16.''

   Court Rejects Theory In Espy Prosecution
</P>
<P>
   With a narrow interpretation of the federal gratuity statute,
the Supreme Court made it substantially less likely that someone
could inadvertently cross the line between bestowing gifts on a
public official and committing a crime. The unanimous decision
rejected the theory behind an independent counsel's prosecution of
former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy and of an agricultural
cooperative convicted of giving him tennis tickets and other items.
</P>
<P>
   The court said such gifts were illegal only if linked to an
``official act,'' hoped-for or accomplished; merely cultivating
good will is not a crime.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Justices to Rule on Tobacco
</P>
<P>
   It was far from a victory in the tobacco wars, but it was the
best the Clinton administration could hope for from the Supreme
Court. The justices agreed to decide whether the Food and Drug
Administration has the authority to regulate tobacco products as a
drug. While a ruling is perhaps a year off, the court thus kept
alive the prospect of federal regulation of smoking, which appeared
dead last summer when a federal appeals court ruled that Congress
had never given the FDA jurisdiction over cigarettes.

</P>
<P>
   More Damage in Spy Case
</P>
<P>
   Government officials now say a scientist already suspected of
spying for China may have given away secrets to virtually every
nuclear weapon in America's arsenal. Mainly in 1994 and 1995, the
scientist, Wen Ho Lee, downloaded computer codes from a classified
system at the national laboratory in Los Alamos, N.M., and
transferred the data to a widely accessible computer network at the
lab, officials said. Senior members of Congress expressed outrage
over the government's failure to monitor Lee.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Eases Some Sanctions
</P>
<P>
   Trade sanctions were once a preferred method of punishing
nations linked to terrorism, like Iran and Libya. But a two-year
Clinton administration study has concluded that sanctions on food
and medicine tend to backfire, doing little to counter terrorism
while depriving innocent civilians. As a result, the White House
announced that as a general rule, food and medicine will be exempt
from sanctions. An early beneficiary will be Iran, which will
probably be allowed to import $500 million worth of U.S. grain and
sugar.

   Palestinian Delay on Statehood
</P>
<P>
   Backing down from a pledge that Israelis regarded as a threat,
Palestinian leaders decided against declaring statehood May 4, the
end of the five-year interim period set up under the Oslo peace
accord. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat urged the Palestinian
Central Council to abandon the idea of pronouncing the West Bank
and Gaza Strip a Palestinian state less than two weeks before the
Israeli elections. He told the council that U.S. and European
officials, and some Arab leaders, had asked them not to make a
unilateral declaration at this sensitive moment in order to avoid
rupturing the peace process.
</P>

   The council will resume its talks over the fate of the state in
June.

   India is heading toward its third general election in three

majority, he dissolved the Parliament to make way for fresh

   U.S. Birth Rate at New Low
</P>
<P>
   For the last six years, federal officials have announced a
steady decline in the teen-age birth rate. Now officials say the
rate has dipped so sharply that it has helped push the nation's
overall birth rate to the lowest point since the government began
keeping records in 1909.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Center for Health Statistics, there
were 52.3 births for every 1,000 teen-agers in 1997, a drop of 16
percent since 1991.

tectonic plates, even stirrings of life _ the makings, in short, of
Earth today.
</P>
<P>
   For the suggestion in the finding of telltale magnetic patterns
isn't so much that the Martian route was the evolution not taken,
but that Mars today is an out-of-sync cousin, not a different
planetary breed.

</P>
<P>
   India is heading toward its third general election in three
years following the collapse of the Hindu nationalist-led
government that had ruled the nation for the past year. The
fractious ruling coalition narrowly lost a vote of confidence two
weeks ago, and when President K.R. Narayanan concluded that the
equally fractious opposition parties had failed to muster a new
majority, he dissolved the Parliament to make way for fresh
elections, which must be held within six months.

   ``We are becoming a nation of gamblers,'' said Richard Leone,
one of the nine members of the National Gambling Impact Study
Commission. Leone proposed inserting that declaration into the
commission's forthcoming report, which will be delivered to
Congress and President Clinton on June, 18. The commission is
expected to recommend changes to state lotteries, a ban on Internet
betting, tighter regulations for Indian casinos and a moratorium on
gambling expansion.

   U.S. Birth Rate at New Low
</P>
<P>
   For the last six years, federal officials have announced a
steady decline in the teen-age birth rate. Now officials say the
rate has dipped so sharply that it has helped push the nation's
overall birth rate to the lowest point since the government began
keeping records in 1909.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Center for Health Statistics, there
were 52.3 births for every 1,000 teen-agers in 1997, a drop of 16
percent since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Every state reported a decline, and the drop was most pronounced
among Puerto Rican and non-Hispanic black teens.

   Arkansas Lawmakers Indicted
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 session of the Arkansas General Assembly was widely
derided around Little Rock because of the large number of
legislators who found legal ways to profit personally from state
contracts. Though ethics laws were later tightened, Arkansans
didn't learn until now how bad things might have been.

   A federal grand jury indicted 10 people, including legislators,
state officials and lawyers, in a wide-ranging corruption scheme
that allegedly funneled $5 million in state money back to
lawmakers.

   Another Link With Mars
</P>
<P>
   There was a whiff of planetary mortality in the latest evidence
that Mars, though barren now, once had it all: water, shifting
tectonic plates, even stirrings of life _ the makings, in short, of
Earth today.
</P>
<P>
   For the suggestion in the finding of telltale magnetic patterns
isn't so much that the Martian route was the evolution not taken,
but that Mars today is an out-of-sync cousin, not a different
planetary breed.
</P>
<P>
   This, perhaps, is where Earth is headed.

   CARACAS, Venezuela _ He is a head of state now, no longer a
renegade colonel plotting a coup d'etat. At his insistence, a cowed
Congress has given him the authority to rule by decree, and voters
here last week convoked a Constituent Assembly that seems likely to
greatly expand his powers and term of office. But three months
after he was sworn in as president, Hugo Chavez continues to
perplex and unnerve Venezuelans, not to mention the rest of Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   There is no denying that Chavez, a 44-year-old former
paratrooper who in 1992 led a bloody but failed attempt to
overthrow the elected government of this South American nation, is
the most intriguing political figure to emerge in the region in
years. His speeches, railing against privilege and corruption and
promising a peaceful ``social revolution'' that will redeploy
Venezuela's vast oil wealth to improve the lives of the masses,
have electrified a citizenry that had grown cynical and despondent
about the prospect of change.
</P>
<P>
   But Chavez has also engaged in behavior that can only be
described as bizarre coming from a head of state, and has
demonstrated little understanding of _ or patience with _ the
normal give and take of politics as conducted in a democracy. A
former associate who has broken with the president calls him ``a
Jekyll and Hyde'' figure with pronounced authoritarian tendencies,
and Chavez himself seems to take pride in baffling all who would
demand consistency, either intellectual or deportmental, from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are designing something completely new here, and from the
ideological point of view I absolutely refuse, and will refuse to
the grave, to let myself be labeled or boxed in,'' he said
recently. ``I cannot accept the notion that politics or ideology
are geometric. To me, right and left are relative terms. I am
inclusive, and my thinking has a little bit of everything,
especially at this moment in which paradigms are being shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's recent threats to dissolve Congress and the Supreme
Court, institutions he calls ``worm-eaten and decadent,'' and to
send his supporters into the streets can be viewed as an exercise
in bare-knuckles political brinkmanship. As tactics, they are
perhaps coarse, and summon unsettling memories of past military
strongmen in the region like Juan Peron. But they have proven
effective and are hardly surprising, given that Chavez came to
maturity in a military environment where orders were given and
obeyed.
</P>
<P>
   It is far more difficult to explain the friendly letter Chavez
wrote recently to the terrorist Carlos the Jackal, a Venezuelan
serving a life sentence in a French prison whose acts include
murder, hijackings and the kidnapping of OPEC oil ministers in
1975. Venezuela is a member in good standing of the oil cartel,
whose recent success in scaling back production to push up gasoline
prices could not have occurred without the cooperation of Chavez's
Government. But that did not prevent Chavez from addressing Carlos
the Jackal as a comrade in arms in the same unnamed cause.
</P>
<P>
   It is simply human solidarity,'' said Chavez, who was clearly
offended that his motives were being questioned when the existence
of the letter surfaced and there were criticisms of his conduct
here. ``I was in prison for two years, and I know it is
heartwarming when one receives a letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Though many of his public pronouncements have a left-populist
flavor, Chavez has discomfited the Jewish community and others here
by cultivating a friendship with an obscure Argentine writer,
Norberto Ceresole, who maintains the Holocaust never occurred.
Ceresole espouses a neo-fascist doctrine that calls for bypassing
political parties in favor of a ``leader-army-masses'' triangle,
and many observers claim to see traces of that philosophy in
Chavez's harsh attacks on Venezuela's two main political groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``He trusts no political party, not even his own,'' the
amorphous Fifth Republic Movement, said the ambassador of a
European country. ``He sees himself as embodying the desires of the
masses and having a direct link to them, and so his vision of
democracy sees no need for intermediaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration would surely prefer a more
conventional political leader in charge of a country that in recent
years has become the United States' principal source of imported
oil. Chavez was in fact banned from traveling to the United States
after the 1992 coup attempt. But the ban was lifted after he was
elected president in December, and he visited Washington before
taking office in an effort to patch things up.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that is past history,'' a State Department official said
earlier this year. But recently there have been signs of tension in
the relationship with Washington. Granted, the Clinton
administration expressed no objections to the referendum here, in
which more than 80 percent of voters endorsed Chavez's call for an
assembly to write a new constitution. ``The important point for the
United States government is that the process of reform move forward
in a democratic fashion,'' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a visit by an assistant secretary of State
scheduled for late April was postponed indefinitely after
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel, a prominent
journalist who is well-known for his anti-American outbursts,
accused Washington of exerting ``elements of pressure'' to thwart
Chavez's efforts to transform Venezuelan society. What drew
Rangel's wrath was the latest of numerous U.S. statements
expressing support for Chavez so long as he respects ``democratic
parameters.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, whatever autocratic ambitions Chavez may harbor
are constrained by countervailing institutions and a balance of
powers that has been put in place during more than 40 years of
democracy. But the constituent assembly, which is scheduled to
begin six months of deliberations in July, is likely to change all
that, and Chavez maintains that, despite a recent Supreme Court
ruling to the contrary, the 131-member assembly will have the power
to dissolve the legislative and judicial branches of government.
</P>
<P>
   To amused applause, a satirical revue that has been drawing
packed houses here since shortly after Chavez was elected suggests
that his long and increasingly frequent speeches on television need
subtitles to explain what he really means. Venezuela, a comedian
remarks, is living through a ``state of transition,'' which he
defines as ``going from one mess you know to another that is
completely unknown.'' When he says that, though, the response is
not applause, but nervous laughter.

 &HT;    Colorado massacre spawns copycats, fear
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ SWAT teams and bomb disposal squads are
showing up on school grounds with the regularity of visiting
football teams.
</P>
<P>
   Parents are wondering whether the school year is effectively
finished. Teachers watch warily for bulging back packs. Students
look over their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Colorado high school massacre 13 days ago, more than a
dozen Florida middle and high school students have been questioned
by police after making specific threats to blow up or shoot
teachers and students. Several were suspended, a few arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, hundreds of bomb threats have been reported
at schools. A monotonous litany of copycat calls and written
warnings kept thousands out of class. On Friday, many schools
closed because of rumored violence, some tied to the anniversary of
Hitler's suicide.
</P>
<P>
   All of these incidents are news because they affected families
and educators in communities coast to coast. Still, questions must
be asked about how direct a connection there is between each
incident and the shootings at Columbine High.
</P>
<P>
   If there are connections, what are they? Are other, important
lessons from the Colorado carnage being ignored because the media
and students and parents are all caught up in a national hysteria?
</P>
<P>
   Is reason being applied to fact, or is fear flowing from rumor?
</P>
<P>
   ``Rumor and fear are now the enemy,'' says David Cantley,
principal of Lake Worth High School. ``It's so quiet here it's
scary. We've had a quiet year, just the usual friendly fistfights
between willing participants. But the rumors since the Colorado
shootings are causing chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to go onto the P.A. system to say, `No, I have not been
threatened; no, there is no gang on the way to shoot it out with
Mexican students; no, there has been no face-off between Haitian
and white students.' Even then, a student misunderstood and his
father called me at home, upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Cantley finally had to call police to Lake Worth High to
help him quell rumors, not because of any actual incident.
</P>
<P>
   Are today's schools are out of control? Or are the perpetrators
this year's model of the wise guys who have pulled fire alarms for
as long as there have been alarms to pull? Are they angry kids?
Idle kids? Evil?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have far, far fewer false alarms and bomb threats than 15
years ago. I've heard that back in the desegregation era of the
early '70s, it was just crazy _ bomb threats, rumors. Years ago,
the Lake Worth police used to rotate through this building 20 times
a day it seems, for fights, threats, trouble. Schools are safer
now, and we'll keep them safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Drop in gun crimes
</P>
<P>
   Statistics back up Cantley.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the U.S. Department of Justice released a report on
strategies to reduce gun violence. The report states: ``Gun related
crime peaked in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Since that time,
the United States has made steady progress in reducing gun-related
violence. Between 1992 and 1996, handgun homicides declined 35
percent. Murder rates declined by 20 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also states that schools are the safest place for
children, especially those from high-crime neighborhoods _ safer
than streets, playgrounds, work places, and, safer than the home.
</P>
<P>
   Among the conclusions:
</P>
<P>
   Violent deaths in school settings declined 27.3 percent between
1992 and 1996. Less than 1 percent of all violent crimes against
youths take place in schools.
</P>
<P>
   A two-year study by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention found that the incidence of school-related violent death
was less than one in a million.
</P>
<P>
   During school year 1996-1997, more than 54 million students
attended U.S. schools; 40 were killed in school.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, according to Barry Glassner, a professor of sociology
at the University of California, the number of murder stories on
network newscasts increased 600 percent since 1990, ``not counting
stories about O.J. Simpson.''
</P>
<P>
   Glassner says in his book, FEAR, Why Americans are Afraid of the
Wrong Things, ``Valid fears have their place; they cue us to
danger. False and overdrawn fears only cause hardship.''
</P>
<P>
   He stresses one point throughout the book: TV violence, whether
news or fiction, sometimes causes fear but does not cause violence.
He advises adults and parents to sift through misinformation for
the rational nuggets that can help solve real problems.
</P>
<P>
   Cantley agrees. ``My advice to students is turn off the TV.
These kids have active imaginations. What they see on TV, over and
over and over again, does nothing but scare them. They need to be
active, play their sports, do their homework, talk to their parents
about news that troubles them. But turn off the TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Glassner goes Cantley one better. ``Kids shouldn't have to turn
off the TV,'' he says. ``They should be able to watch well
reasoned, informative coverage that explores facts and debunks
myths. They ought to learn from TV, not become afraid, except of
those things they should be afraid of.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the Colorado footage over and over again on TV and you
begin to feel that this type of incident is more frequent than it
is. Then you ask why, but your question is based on paranoia,
faulty information. Of course it seems that way, you're seeing the
same scene over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``And count the times you hear words like `cult,' `Marilyn
Manson,' `epidemic.' These are words that put you on a path to
nowhere. The question should be: What does it take to commit mass
murder? The answer is: weapons of mass destruction. Guns. And
bombs, even though nobody in Colorado died from a bomb. As long as
the media talk about epidemics of violence, real questions will go
unanswered. All you'll get is fear. The wrong fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools are safe. Statistic: A student is three times more
likely to be hit by lightning than be killed in school.
</P>
<P>
   But how to prevent the lightning strike? And what to do when
lightning strikes?
</P>
<P>
   Cantley says he and his teachers are always on the lookout for
behavioral changes in students, a sudden drop in grades, hints of
trouble at home.
</P>
<P>
   Cantley's biggest fear after Colorado is police response time if
there were a real hostage situation or shooting at his school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt the Lake Worth police would show up fast and
go into this school like bulldogs,'' he says. ``They've been to the
school for walk-through assessments. They have the blueprints. But
as I watched the coverage of the Colorado shootings, I found myself
thinking, `Am I supposed to stand outside my school for three hours
while SWAT teams tiptoe around the bushes and my kids are inside?'
Not on your life. I'm going back into my school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a credible fear,'' says Glassner. ``Why did it take
Colorado police three hours to get kids out? That's a good
question, one that can offer a lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't there, so I'm not going to criticize the Colorado
response,'' says Capt. Jack Maxwell, head of the Palm Beach County
Sheriff's Office Special Response Team. ``But if kids are watching
those tapes, I don't blame them for being afraid. I hate to say it,
but I can see myself in the near future at schools lecturing
students and teachers on the proper response to a terrorist-style
incident. Everybody has a role.
</P>
<P>
   ``My team's job in a hostage taking or shooting is to isolate
and contain the suspects quickly. We'd look for signs of what sort
of weapons they have, how many wounded, how many suspects. Every
situation is different, but the focus remains the same _ isolate
and contain.''
</P>
<P>
   The former head of an FBI SWAT team in New England added: ``We'd
head for the shots, the smoke, the screams. You don't want your
people hurt, but you go in _ fast. Colorado wasn't a hostage
situation where you get the pizza guy there and everybody talks on
the phone. It was a mess, but you have to step over the bombs and
hope they don't explode. You keep moving. Your target is the bad
guys. Find them. If they're still shooting, shoot them. Shoot to
kill. That's the best way to save the children.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparedness is key
</P>
<P>
   Colorado police spokesmen say the scene at Columbine High School
was chaos _ tiles falling, sprinklers flooding halls, bombs all
over the place, a crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it was chaotic,'' says the Boston FBI agent, who
asked not to be identified. ``But it wasn't a crime scene until it
was over. Then the lab guys and bomb guys go in. Two lessons can be
learned from Colorado. You save lives by taking out the shooters
fast. Second, kids and teachers must be prepared to help
themselves. Look out the door, listen for the direction of shots.
Go out the way the police came in. Make a break for it if the good
guys haven't shown up. You can't sit under a desk for three hours
and wait your turn to be shot. Have a plan. If anything halfway
good comes out of this, it's the need for everyone to have a plan
and know what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Cantley agrees. ``We had, years ago, a plan to respond to gunmen
in the school, a c

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Oases of progress
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are, suddenly, a couple of freshets of progressive impulse
from political barrens ordinarily known instead for their aridity.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas House of Representatives not only has passed a
hate-crimes bill but has included in it _ quick, hide the children
_ sexual orientation as a covered category, along with race, gender
and religion.
</P>
<P>
   And an Arizona Supreme Court study reports that after a year's
experience with the referendum-enacted Drug Medicalization,
Prevention and Control Act, the new policies have cut both drug use
and crime _ and have saved money to boot _ by not sending users to
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona voters enacted the proposition in 1996 by 65 percent to
35. It requires that nonviolent users charged with possession
receive mandatory probation and treatment instead of prison
sentences. It earmarks a liquor tax to pay for placing drug
offenders into targeted programs and sets up a Parents' Commission
on Drug Education and Prevention to run youth education.
</P>
<P>
   The court study finds that in its first full year, the policy
kept 2,622 offenders out of prison and placed 98 percent in
recommended programs. Seventy-seven percent of those tested
drug-free after completing treatment. (Unusually high: Expect some
erosion over time.) Into the bargain _ with treatment running $16 a
day and prison $50 _ taxpayers came out $2.6 million to the good.
</P>
<P>
   The court report predicts, as well, ``an increase in the quality
of life conditions of this population such as improved family and
social relationships, increased work productivity and wages, and
decreased health system costs.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospects for the Texas House's dabble in the mildly
progressive are iffier.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the House had balked at hate-crime laws while the
Senate was amenable, but now that the House has turned around, the
Senate, with a new Republican majority, is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   And a question mark hangs over Gov. George W. Bush, too.
(Indeed, question marks are stacking up there, as Bush, keen not to
wreck his frontrunner status for the GOP presidential nomination,
avoids dicey policy choices that could estrange one or another of
his party's demanding ideological factions.) Bush in the past has
supported hate-crimes legislation generically but had never
addressed the sexual-orientation specific. Can he stand up to the
GOP's homophobic fringe?
</P>
<P>
   Even in their mildest forms, hate-crime laws abrade
conservatives. Add sexual orientation and the religious and
cultural right-wings go more or less nuts. (Isn't it odd that
conservatives, who usually want to imprison everybody else just on
general principles, won't punish the terrorist intent that gives
hate-motivated crime its extra onus?)
</P>
<P>
   However the statehouse politics work out, a recent statewide
poll found strong majority support for hate-crimes legislation,
with 76 percent of Texans in favor of covering gays.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine. A referendum for liberal drug laws in Arizona and
popular support for protecting gays from hate crime in Texas. The
people are lapping their politicians.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Presidents at their worst
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have a theory about the U.S. presidency. It goes something
like this:
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. presidency has been going from bad to worse for 40
years, and the worst is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the following, all of whom helped put the hiss in
history.
</P>
<P>
   _ JFK assassinated in his first term, which turned out to be a
good career move. As it was, the worst of Kennedy's private life
would remain blacked out for another generation.
</P>
<P>
   _ LBJ was going to nail the coonskin to the wall, he said of
Vietnam. He ended up a casualty of his own making, along with
58,000 American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nixon was forced to resign in the wake of the Watergate
scandal, such was his disgrace. What a liar. He even tried to tell
the American public he was not a crook.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ford was our stand-in president who had trouble standing on
his own two feet. After he pardoned Nixon, a majority of voters in
the next election were quick to trade him in.
</P>
<P>
   _ Carter is best remembered as the malaise president, the man
Iran had running scared. Let it be said in his favor: He's probably
the best ex-president we've ever had.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reagan acted the part well enough, reading the lines they gave
him. Too bad we couldn't read between the lines. His legacy was a
$3 trillion national debt.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bush lost the presidency even though he won the war, doing
what we should have done in Vietnam _ declaring victory and pulling
out. Never mind Saddam's still on his throne, and we're still
suffering casualties from Gulf War syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton, the Comeback Kid who can't help coming on to the
women, turned out to be an embarrassment with a capital ASS. If he
ever visits war-torn Kosovo, he'll probably arrive with his pockets
stuffed with nylons.
</P>
<P>
   That takes us up to today, and beyond that, tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Next president? How about the worst-case scenario for the worst
yet?
</P>
<P>
   I'm betting on Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   What convinced me was a list of Quayle quotes making the rounds
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Lest we forget, here's a sampling of responses reported during
his term as vice president:
</P>
<P>
   ``I love California, I practically grew up in Phoenix.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A low voter turnout is an indication of fewer people going to
the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Illegitimacy is something we should talk about in terms of not
having it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ready for any unforeseen event that may or may not
occur.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For NASA, space is still a high priority.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, teachers are the only profession that teach our
children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't pollution that's harming the environment. It's the
impurities in our air and water that are doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What a waste it is to lose one's mind. Or not having a mind is
very wasteful.'' He was trying to recite, ``A mind is a terrible
thing to waste.''
</P>
<P>
   ``May our nation continue to be the beakon of hope to the
world.'' The Quayles' 1989 Christmas card, not exactly a beacon of
literacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have the best-educated American people in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The list goes on and on. But suffice it to say, the following
says it all:
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand by all the misstatements I've made.''
</P>
<P>
   But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe choosing a rotten log as presidential
timber isn't inevitable. Maybe things will improve.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as Dan Quayle once said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we are on an irreversible trend ... but that could
change.''

 &HT;    Time capsules fulfill urge to preserve
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Since ancient hunters started drawing pictures on cave
walls, human beings have been trying to pass along their life
stories to future generations. Over the ages, we have gotten better
at preserving our drawings, writings, clothing, tools and other
objects to inform descendents about our lives.
</P>
<P>
   Now as the millennium winds down, this urge to preserve is
growing. Individuals, families, schools, clubs, churches and
corporations are creating lots of new time capsules to be sealed up
Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Most people define a ``time capsule'' as a container filled with
items chosen to reflect daily life at a particular time. The
original experts were the ancient Egyptians. They built enormous
pyramids to serve not only as vessels to the afterlife but also as
bridges to the future. They filled their stone pyramids with
jewelry, furniture, urns, garments, cuneiform inscriptions and
other objects that tell about life some 4,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, we generally have stuffed our objects into the
cornerstones of important buildings, such as schools, churches and
government offices. For example, a cornerstone in an 1851 extension
of the U.S. Capitol lies undisturbed since it was filled with
coins, newspapers and historical parchments.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20th century, the desire to preserve information and
objects for posterity has gotten a boost from the creation of tough
new materials.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1939 World's Fair, for example, Westinghouse Electric
built a time capsule from a new alloy of copper, called Cupaloy.
The durable capsule was buried in Flushing, Queens, in a crypt that
incorporated Pyrex glass, water repellents and preservative gases.
</P>
<P>
   Should the capsule last its intended 5,000 years, our
descendents will find an array of goods including a Sears Roebuck
catalog, a Mickey Mouse cup, cigarettes, a fountain pen, a slide
rule and an electric lamp.
</P>
<P>
   Today, one small company in Morgan Hill, Calif., is selling
aluminum capsules designed to last for hundreds of years without
rusting or becoming brittle.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the clubs and corporations buying the cylindrical
devices, which look a little like a Thermos bottle, are thinking
particularly long term, said Gillian Barr, co-owner of Barr
Technologies Inc. ``We're getting sororities that want to bring
people back together in 25 or 30 years for reunions,'' Barr said.
``They want to be present when it's opened.''
</P>
<P>
   Some college students can't wait even that long. This year, a
group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology sealed up a 1999
digital time capsule containing information drawn from the
Internet. It's set to be opened in the distant year of ... 2004.
That's the same year many of today's journalists will get around to
opening the Dunkin' Donuts boxes they on left on their desks this
week. But I digress.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite end of the time continuum is a group of would-be
preservationists in New York led by French artist Jean-Marc
Philippe. They are raising money to create a time capsule to orbit
the Earth for 50,000 years. Participants are being asked to write a
message of up to 6,000 characters and submit it through a Web site
(http://www.keo.org). According to the plan, the messages will be
stored on special, glass-tempered CD-ROMs and sent into outer space
in a satellite that will fall back to Earth in 50,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   One can only hope that CD players haven't gone the way of
eight-track tapes by 52,000 A.D.

 &HT;    Digging into gardening easy on Web
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The World Wide Web is a perfect place for your next
garden.
</P>
<P>
   It is, after all, the world's largest library for gardening
information. Almost any topic _ from information on rare plants to
the most basic tips for planting a radish seed _ is available, with
photographs, at the click of a mouse. And since this is the right
time of the year for planting in most areas, we'll take a walk
through some of the best gardening sites today.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start at the Garden Gate at garden-gate.prairienet.org/.
You'll be pleased with how easy it is to search for specific
information. The site practically takes you by the hand. Just press
on the link that says ``Finding Answers,'' and you'll get automated
help in finding the gardening information you want. And that search
help isn't limited to this site, but covers the entire Web.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, suppose your search is a simple one ... you want
to find out about day lilies. Then you'll be offered a list of
general sites. But for more esoteric information, Garden Gate will
point you toward some search engines that will take you further. Or
if you have a specific question, you'll be taken to areas where
experts answer direct questions. There also are links to chat
areas.
</P>
<P>
   There also are photo tours of some of the world's most beautiful
gardens.
</P>
<P>
   There's something really appealing about the next site from Ohio
State University. It's called Web Garden and is located at
www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/webgarden.html. Here you'll find links to
Web pages created by students at the school's class that teaches
the use of computers for horticultural management. These are sites
worth an A. You'll find plenty of topics represented here,
including creating a cutting garden, garden photography, several
related to landscaping yards and developing healthy grass, and one
called ``Japanese Gardens for Morons like Me.''
</P>
<P>
   The next site, called Virtual Garden, also has some fine
databases of specific plant information. But one thing that sets
this site _ located at www.vg.com/ _ apart is the basic gardening
information you'll find. If you're just starting out and need help
in the simplest things _ everything from finding the right tools
for gardening, to learning how to prepare the soil and find the
plants that are best for your area _ you'll get it here.
</P>
<P>
   Beginners also will like the Gardening by Mail area of this
site. That's where you'll find ways to contact the garden suppliers
that you'll need.
</P>
<P>
   Our last stop on the garden tour is actually a department within
a larger site called Home Arts. The section is called Bloom!
(homearts.com/depts/garden/00gardc1.htm) and has many of the
features offered by the other sites. We'll talk about two of them.
One really nifty area of this site is called Seed Swap.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot of fun. Just press on the link and leave a note
offering a specific seed or asking for one. If you have a special
interest in a rare plant, it's a great way to meet others who feel
the same way. Do keep in mind however, that you'll need to exercise
all the usual cautions a prudent person would take when meeting
strangers on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The other area that merits praise is one that lets you select a
specific month from a pull-down menu. Then you'll get reminders for
the specific chores that are appropriate for that time of the year.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The soda sisterhood
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ I have sunk to a new all-time low.
</P>
<P>
   One recent Saturday, I went to the refrigerator to get my Diet
Coke _ the morning nectar of women everywhere _ only to discover we
were out. The kids had been home all week and, finding no
alternative sodas, must have drunk all of mine.
</P>
<P>
   Panicked, I rummaged in the back of the vegetable and meat
drawers, where I sometimes stash a few away from my foraging sons.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   This was serious. I'm not proud to admit this, but I need my
Diet Coke. Even though I don't like the taste all that much, I must
have it to keep my day on an even keel.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't always so dependent. I used to disdain Diet Coke, but
my friends kept offering it to me. ``Just try one,'' they'd urge. I
said no. Yet cans of it were everywhere _ at church fellowships, at
work, at concession stands. ``Here, have a sip of mine,'' they'd
say, luring me like the sirens of ancient mythology.
</P>
<P>
   The seduction continued on television, in print, and even on
street corners where the vending machines glowed brightly in the
night.
</P>
<P>
   I withheld as long as I could, but finally, I grew weak. I
couldn't resist the constant temptation. After drinking a few, I
began to buy them in quantities _ first the six-pack, then the
12-pack, and now, thanks to the ever-obliging supplier, 20-packs _
even though they take a small forklift to transport. The supply
must not dry up.
</P>
<P>
   My place of work doesn't have Coca-Cola products, due to a
contractual agreement. They have been stripped from the vending
machines, the cafeterias and the concession stands. There are
several of us at work who drink Diet Coke. The day they took away
the last cans from our office machines, we bade a solemn farewell,
tears trickling down our cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   We are the Diet Coke 'hood _ a stronger, more loyal sisterhood
than even the bonds of birth, career or parenthood create. We know
each other's names and phone extensions. We know where each keeps
her supply. If one of us inadvertently runs out, we seek the others
out. No sister in the 'hood would deny another.
</P>
<P>
   When a well-meaning officemate sent around an e-mail about the
alleged health dangers of artificial sweeteners like the kind found
in diet sodas, we nearly ran her out of the office on a crushed
aluminum can rail.
</P>
<P>
   So there I was on that Saturday morning with no Diet Coke. I
seriously considered rousing my 16-year-old son from bed to go to
the store, since I was fairly certain he had consumed a good
portion of them. But the repercussions from that hasty act would
have been far worse than the headache I was beginning to get from
lack of caffeine. Instead, I threw on some clothes, grabbed the car
keys and drove to the nearest store. I got a cold can from the
vending machine outside the store for immediate gratification, and
then went in to get a 12-pack for later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   I had sunk to this, making desperate runs to get my supply. And
I didn't even try to hide the fact by picking up a few other items
just to cover. Nope, just Diet Coke. Give it to me straight.
</P>
<P>
   So this is what I've come to. You see me on the soccer sideline,
aluminum can in hand. You see me during Sunday school, Bible in one
hand, Diet Coke in the other. You see me in the grocery store
pushing a cart with a Diet Coke in the little holder. You see
crumpled cans on the floor of my minivan.
</P>
<P>
   I console myself by noting that I could have worse vices.
Actually, I do. But then, that's another column _ or two.

 &HT;    Stock analyst uses PC, touts Apple
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even some of those who don't use Macs are falling in
love with Apple Computer. Take Kevin Prigel, a confirmed PC user
and investment analyst at StreetAdvisor.com.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent analysis published on StreetAdvisor's Web site,
Prigel says he's learned to love Apple Computer because of its
soaring stock price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, the Apple Computer story keeps getting better,''
wrote Prigel. ``After beating earnings estimates by a sound 7
percent when every other box maker has been missing estimates, this
company looks poised for a great run.''
</P>
<P>
   Prigel based his comment on seven analytical points.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Prigel said that, since the rollout of the iMac
last August, Apple Computer's sales have increased roughly 10
percent every quarter. That adds up to a whopping 46 percent jump
in sales on an annualized basis, Prigel calculated.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of computer companies increase sales only to see their
profit margins fall through price cutting. Not Apple Computer. Its
gross profits increased 121 percent in the first quarter from the
same period a year earlier, concluded Prigel.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a company that lost nearly $2 billion two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Prigel contends that users no longer care what operating system
is running on their computers _ as long as they can run the
programs they want or need. With Microsoft's commitment to keep
making current versions of its popular software for Macs, Apple's
computers are now on a level playing field with Windows machines,
says Prigel.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Microsoft's Office 98 for the Mac includes features not
yet included in the Windows version of the leading business package
of software titles.
</P>
<P>
   Another Apple Computer strength, says Prigel, is the ease with
which its computers connect to the Internet. He says that no
computers connect faster. ``With an iMac, an inexperienced user can
plug in a power cord and phone line and be online in minutes,''
writes Prigel.
</P>
<P>
   In conclusion, Prigel says, ``Since (Steve Jobs) took over with
Apple Computer floundering, the company has done nothing but
innovate. Believe in Steve Jobs as you would believe in Gates.''
</P>
<P>
   Prigel makes several other points, which you can read for
yourself. His article is fairly easy to follow, even for someone
who is neither a businessman nor an investor.

 &HT;    Mission impossible: Summer visitor just can't stay away
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ ``Fish gotta' swim...birds gotta' fly....''
and beavers have to build dams. Makes little difference to them if
the raw material they're harvesting happens to be the famous cherry
trees in Washington's Tidal Basin. To a beaver, they all look
alike.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, Bucky and his buddies could care less whose yard
they're in. They're just busy doing what comes naturally. Beavers
in the Basin? A red-tailed hawk munching on White House lawn duck?
Even though this is a
</P>
<P>
   different kind of ``wildlife'' from what we have come to
associate with our nation's capital, it is a bit worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   What if this sudden onslaught of nature is the basis for a
cleverly concocted subversive plot? The president can't handle any
more distractions. He has enough on his plate without having to
worry about Godzilla swooping down and hauling Socks away. Come to
think of it, why isn't Buddy outside barking at something?
</P>
<P>
   Normally, I'd offer to help, but right now I have problems of my
own. The raccoon is back.
</P>
<P>
   He showed up a couple of nights ago outside my office windows _
the ones overlooking the front porch roof. The hour was late and
the town had pretty much shut down. I was deep in concentration at
my desk when I heard a resounding WHUMP! on the attic roof above my
head. In a flash, my alert mind and superior reasoning powers
enabled me to pinpoint the disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   Aliens had landed.
</P>
<P>
   Two more thumps, and a bit of scurrying later, the creature was
gawking at me, daubing noseprints all over the office windows. It
was the same kohl-eyed, furry-suited fellow who'd bugged me all the
previous summer. I recognized his attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the moonlight marauder doesn't show up this early in
the year. Usually, he waits until the nights have warmed up and the
cats and I have settled into our summer sleeping quarters on an
upstairs back porch. That's when he begins hanging out in the
eaves, driving the cats nuts and involving me in odd conversations
in the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You back again?'' is my standard opener. He loves it when I
talk to him. He fidgets and cocks his head to one side like he's
really listening to me as I explain that he ought to be out with
his friends doing raccoon stuff like
</P>
<P>
   climbing trees and getting stuck in chimneys.
</P>
<P>
   As long as I keep talking, he'll dangle there a few feet from
the hammock, occasionally shifting his fuzzy self for a more secure
hold on the gutter. If I stop the chatter and try to roll over and
ignore him, he quickly shifts into
</P>
<P>
   his version of an arboreal jitterbug, bouncing to an unheard
beat and taking swipes at the screen from time to time just to
remind us he's out there.
</P>
<P>
   Late last summer, just after I'd caught him up to his elbows
coming through my bedroom screen, the raccoon and I had a serious
talk. As I eased the glass casement closed, careful not to pinch
any toes, I tried to explain that it was nothing personal, but the
time had come for him to accept that we were not going to invite
him in for the winter. I was hoping he'd check out some new digs,
but I underestimated his attachment to the family. It looks like
we're in for a long summer.
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday morning dawned fair and unusually warm for the time
of year, so in a fit of spring euphoria, I threw open the office
windows and took a deep breath. Then I gagged. THEN, I noticed the
flies. Jillions of them. My striped friend had left his calling
card _ three piles of it.
</P>
<P>
   So that's how I happened to be on the porch roof with a broom
this morning. Some folks, no doubt on their way home from church
and filled with a kindly spirit, waved politely. Then George rode
by on his bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey! Whatcha' doin' up there?''
</P>
<P>
   I waggled the broom at him and answered, ``Practicing takeoffs
and landings.'' He pedaled on.
</P>
<P>
   Honestly, folks, I hated lying on a Sunday morning but there was
just no nice way to explain my mission.

 &HT;    Don't blame Internet for kids' bad behavior
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ About a decade ago, in my hometown of Leominster,
Mass., two girls from my high school went home together after
school. Then they took a shotgun down from over the fireplace, went
up to a bedroom, put on some Jimi Hendrix and shot themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, everyone blamed Hendrix.
</P>
<P>
   The local and national media converged on our town, putting up
huge satellite dishes in front of my school for our 15 minutes of
morbid fame. They wrote soul-searching articles on disaffected
youth in local and national newspapers. Quite a lot of time and
videotape was spent trying to find something to blame, some outside
influence that could have caused two teen-age girls to end their
lives one day after school.
</P>
<P>
   In the '90s, two troubled high school students in Colorado,
armed with more ammunition than some Third World countries, nearly
succeeded in their plan to murder everyone at Columbine High. In
the aftermath of this horrifying tragedy, the media once again is
searching for something to blame. This time it was their clothes,
the music they liked, the video games they played and the books
they read.
</P>
<P>
   When it was revealed they liked computers, everyone blamed the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   According to a ``Dateline NBC'' poll, 16 percent of adults
surveyed said that limiting teen-agers' access to the Internet
would keep teen-agers from feeling lonely, depressed and isolated.
Limited Web access will keep the jocks from picking on them and
somehow make the high school experience bearable.
</P>
<P>
   I beg to differ.
</P>
<P>
   There were troubled kids before there was an Internet, and there
will be troubled kids long after the Internet becomes as quaint as
the radio or the newspaper. Amazon.com is not Earth's biggest
bookstore; instead it's the Internet itself. The Internet is the
biggest repository of information and misinformation ever
collected. For every disturbed kid asking Lycos to find
bomb-building sites, there are kids reading up on Kosovo, applying
to college, chatting with friends, taking ``How to tell if he/she
likes you'' quizzes or watching the ``Star Wars'' trailer for the
sixth or seventh time. Some of them are building Web sites that
include pictures of the family pet or a recent vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Not every kid with a Web site or Net access wants to blow up his
high school or glorify Hitler. Try a Yahoo! search for Leonardo Di
Caprio or Claire Danes and you'll find numerous fan pages built by
teens devoted to their favorite movie and music stars. Before there
were computers, their grandparents were doing the same thing _
making hard-copy scrapbooks of their favorite stars.
</P>
<P>
   Most teens and any adult worth talking to will tell you that
high school can be a painful experience even for the most
well-adjusted teen. High school can leave emotional scars that take
years to heal. I have friends still harboring grudges against the
person who beat them out for the lead in the spring musical, stood
them up on prom night or drove cooler cars.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of kids, I spent a lot of time listening to rock
music, watching TV, hanging out at the mall and talking to my
friends on the phone. There were lots of things I was sure my
parents, as much as they loved me, just wouldn't understand. But
even during my worst years of teen-age misery, I never once
considered blowing up my school, not because I didn't have America
Online to corrupt me, but because I knew it was wrong, and as black
as things may have seemed sometimes, I never thought that violence
was the answer to my problems.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reasons, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold believed it
was the answer to theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, The New York Times and CNN are on the Web, but so is page
after page of material devoted to every radical fringe group
imaginable. For a troubled teen looking for something, anything to
latch onto, these sites validate their darkest, most disturbing
thoughts and feelings.
</P>
<P>
   But don't use the Internet as a catch-all excuse for everything
wrong with the kids today. If Harris didn't have Net access, he'd
have found other ways to carry out the massacre he had spent more
than a year planning.
</P>
<P>
   Harris may have had access to a vast store of information,
violent video games and Gothic music videos. It seems the one thing
he did not have and desperately needed was access to a network of
adults and peers who could help him cope with his violent feelings,
his despair and his rage. To borrow from William Shakespeare, ``The
fault lies not in the Web, but with ourselves.''

 &HT;    Server is the traffic cop for a home network
 &HT;    By Gerry Yandel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As Paul Harvey says: ``And now for the rest of the
story ...''
</P>
<P>
   Several readers sent e-mail to warn me there is more to setting
up my in-home network than slapping some cable into an Ethernet hub
and wiring all the machines together.
</P>
<P>
   I had planned to write about what else it takes to split one
cable modem throughout the house. After all, I am learning a lot of
this stuff as I go, just as many of you are. But there's no sense
in putting off the inevitable. Let's talk about setting up a
network server.
</P>
<P>
   In order to simultaneously use one Internet provider address,
you'll have to make one of the machines on your network a traffic
cop and communicate with the other machines on your local area
network. In the simplest of terms, this means that one of your
machines will have to be able to talk to the rest of the machines
in your house. It will also allow all the machines to share a
single IP address, by letting you assign them all a secondary
address on your network.
</P>
<P>
   Your server software then acts as a translator between your
Internet provider and your own network, assigning the proper
packets of data to the proper IP addresses.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, say your son is online in his room playing
``Doom'' and you are online doing your banking in the den. The
server will send the packets of ``Doom'' data to the IP address in
the bedroom and the data from the bank's Web server to the IP
address in the den.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious way to set up your server is to buy a cheap PC
to be used only as a server and stash it with the cable modem. As
far as server software goes, there are several flavors and versions
available.
</P>
<P>
   Some readers suggested using Linux, some versions of which come
with Apache server software, but I am not quite at that juncture
yet. It's a learning curve I have been avoiding. (I did buy myself
RedHat 5.2 for Christmas, and I had a great time installing it. But
that's as far as I got.) One reader swears by the ``Linux Edge
Router,'' a small server and Linux kernel that'll run off a floppy
disk. It seemed straightforward enough to a Linux neophyte like
myself.
</P>
<P>
   Another reader suggested Wingate 3.0. A version called Wingate
Home is priced at $39.95 for three users and $69.95 for six users.
</P>
<P>
   The type of software you decide upon will dictate the hardware
required for your server. Linux Edge, like pretty much all
Linux-based servers, runs off a 486 with 16 megabytes of RAM.
Windows NT, obviously, requires a bit more power and, therefore, a
more expensive machine. Wingate Home works with Win95, 98 and NT,
and there are several other products out that will allow you to set
up a server in those operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   It also isn't necessary to have a separate server set up. Any of
your primary computers could also function as the server.
</P>
<P>
   But, with the cheap prices of 486s and Pentiums, there's no
reason not to get a machine to use solely as a server, and it's
probably more advantageous to have a separate server. Having a
machine functioning solely as a server will also bypass problems of
not having enough PCI slots and IRQs for your two Ethernet cards in
one machine.
</P>
<P>
   Also realize that an in-home network is not only for cable modem
sharing. One reader wrote about his in-home network of five
machines all sharing a 33.6 modem.
</P>
<P>
   Even when all five machines are online simultaneously, they get
acceptable access, he writes, although there can be a noticeable
performance drain if some of them are doing packet-intensive work.

 &HT;    On a budget? Don't ignore Buick Century
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Are you one of those people who has champagne taste
but a beer budget?
</P>
<P>
   Do you sometimes need space for six adults? Would you really
like the image that goes with a premium, upscale brand?
</P>
<P>
   Reality _ like that for a lot of us _ is that your final
purchase decision is dictated by your budget.
</P>
<P>
   You might want to glance in a direction you might not have
considered _ the Buick Century.
</P>
<P>
   With more youthful, contemporary styling and a host of standard
equipment and innovative design features, the midsize Century has
more trunk space and more interior room than any other car in its
segment, Buick says. It might be a luxury car the masses can
afford.
</P>
<P>
   Standard vehicle pricing begins at $20,145, but a fully equipped
model that includes leather seating, six-way power front seats,
rear seat armrest, cruise control, auto-dimming rearview mirror and
premium-grade stereo with cassette/CD player and
steering-wheel-mounted stereo controls can be had for around
$23,500.
</P>
<P>
   The Century's 3.1-liter V-6 provides ample power, while at the
same time offering 20 mpg around town and up to 29 on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   All-speed traction control is now standard not only on the
Century but on all Buicks. The Buick system works in both forward
and reverse by regulating the engine output to enable traction on
wet roads or in sand, snow or gravel. Four-wheel anti-lock brakes
are also standard.
</P>
<P>
   A really neat feature is the tire inflation monitor. An
indicator on the dash notifies the driver that a tire is losing or
has lost air. It requires an average drop of 8-10 psi to trigger
the monitor, but the warning should enable the driver who has
picked up a slow leak or experienced a minor puncture to be able to
get the tire repaired before it is permanently damaged. It also
will alert those of us who have the bad habit of never checking
their air pressure that it is time to pump the black doughnuts back
up.
</P>
<P>
   A low-pressure tire is much more likely to suffer a failure than
a properly inflated one.
</P>
<P>
   Another timely feature is the Century's air filtration system,
which automatically reduces pollen before it reaches the car's
interior. With pollen numbers in some areas currently off the
scale, this feature alone should be worth a test drive during
pollen season.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line, the Buick Century is a pleasant car with upscale
amenities that keep your tires on their toes and allow your nose to
breath cleaner air and at a price that many budgets can handle _
all with a premium badge on the grille.

 &HT;    Common Windows 98 problems exposed
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Windows 98 is such a massive program that you can
never know enough about it. And that fact has produced good fodder
for the PC magazine industry. Take the May issue of PC Computing.
Its cover story is called ``Undocumented Window Secrets.'' Sounds
like the title of some show on the Fox network, doesn't it? Hype
aside, this article offers plenty of helpful hints. The article
identifies 15 common problems with Windows 98. They include such
things as slow Internet connections, clocks that lose time and
disappearing files. The article offers suggestions how to fix these
problems and more.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just corporate computer networks that are threatened by
the Y2K glitch. Many applications you keep on your home computer
are threatened, too. The May issue of PC Computing offers some
guidelines on how to kick the millennium bug off your home desktop
computer.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   There apparently is an unofficial movement under way by the
computer industry to digitize every classic board game. Leading the
charge is Hasbro Interactive. In its latest efforts, the company
has released two collections on computer CD. One is a title called
``Board Games,'' which features some of the best board games. Those
games include chess, checkers, pente, dominoes and connect four. On
the card collection title, called ``Card Games,'' you'll find
spades, cribbage, hearts and gin rummy, among many others. Both of
these CDs are available only for Windows computers.
</P>
<P>
   At last, there's a computer CD about animals that doesn't
involve shooting them. WizardWorks has released a new computer CD
called ``Bird Watcher,'' which calls itself ``an interactive
birding game.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bird Watcher,'' players view photos and video clips of
birds. And there's a game in which you play a raptor as it hunts
for rabbits and fish. ``Bird Watcher'' is available only for PCs
running Windows 95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   Learn about the amazing complexity of the planet _ and learn
what is at risk because of a growing number of endangered plant and
animal species. National Geographic has set up a site that explores
this issue through picture, text and sound. You'll find the site at

 &HT;    Site gets credit for its advice
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's May, and that New Year's resolution to eliminate
your credit debt is sucking wind.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's help online: www.creditpage.com is a Web site
devoted to managing and mitigating your credit debt, brought to
you, in part, by credit card companies and banks.
</P>
<P>
   CreditPage starts with an online test to help gauge the depth of
your credit card addiction. From there, you check your credit
report, find a local credit counselor, read up on your rights as a
borrower and view answers to frequently asked questions.
</P>
<P>
   The site was launched last month, in time for National Credit
Education Week, which was April 18-24.
</P>
<P>
   The site is sponsored by the National Foundation for Consumer
Credit, Debt Counselors of America, the National Council on
Economic Education, the JumpStart Coalition for Personal Finance
Literacy, Genus Credit Management, Money Management International,
Personal Debt Solutions, the Forms Group, Bank of America,
MasterCard International and Visa.

<P>
   Bill-paying blues
</P>
<P>
   It might be the wave of the future. But for now, the people who
pay their bills with their PCs are a byte on a floppy disk.
</P>
<P>
   A bill-payment study from Synergistics Research shows that 79
percent of the people polled pay their bills the old-fashioned way:
They mail them. Thirty percent of the people asked also pay bills
in person, at the biller's office. An almost equal amount _ 29
percent _ arrange for an automatic deduction from their bank
account. Six percent pay at an ATM, 5 percent transfer funds by
telephone and 2 percent use their PC.
</P>
<P>
   The study concludes that billers need to start marketing the PC
option a bit more aggressively, because paying bills by PC has
little appeal if you can't get your bills by PC.
</P>
<P>
   Synergistics Research, based in Atlanta, surveyed 1,100 people
in March.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the study found 40 percent of consumers asked had
some sort of problem with their regular bill-paying method: usually
delays in mail delivery, the time and effort used, and the cost of
postage.
</P>
<P>
   The study found 40 percent of consumers had PCs in their homes.
Of those, 70 percent are on the Web an average of 10 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   For sale by owner
</P>
<P>
   You've decided to bypass real estate agents and their hefty
commissions and sell your own home. But there are still a few
questions left. Like, how much should you sell it for? And what are
some quick and simple things you can do to create a good first
impression?
</P>
<P>
   Check out www.audrie.com, a site designed to guide a
do-it-yourself home seller through the process without a real
estate agent. The site covers everything from touch-up painting to
what to expect from an inspection to creating a ``for sale'' flier
with the help of an online composer.

 &HT;    Don't waste that Y2K worrying on the wrong things
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If there were awards for worrying, you'd see my
picture on the cover of Time magazine accepting the trophy for
being the world champion.
</P>
<P>
   And today I worry you are worried about the wrong things when it
comes to the Year 2000 computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   You'll see a lot of hype about what it can mean to computers in
the United States. I was driving in South Georgia the other day and
saw a billboard that advertised a ``Y2K preparedness gun show.''
This stuff is too weird for me to make up.
</P>
<P>
   There are people, not just in my home state, who are worried
sick about water supplies failing, planes crashing, electrical
grids going dark. Banks are having seminars for their customers _
in fact, that's where I was heading when I saw the billboard _
urging them not to take money out of the bank and bury it in the
back yard because of Y2K fears.
</P>
<P>
   Like I said, I think it's a classic case of worrying about the
wrong thing. To explain why I believe that, we'll have to start
with Melissa.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, the virus called Melissa caught most of the
computing world by surprise and caused all sorts of problems. It
snuck in on an e-mail attachment and then invaded both business and
home computers, causing them to send Microsoft Word documents as
e-mail from the target computer to up to 50 folks. That sort of
traffic choked the Internet and probably embarrassed the heck out
of a lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   Well, no one likes to be caught by surprise. So most folks _
both in the computing business and in the media that cover it _
spent a lot of time worrying about that happening again. When it
came time for a virus called Chernobyl to be triggered (on the
April 26 anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster), TV
and the newspapers were full of dire reports of what could happen.
</P>
<P>
   What happened in this country was ... not much. It was a
different story in other parts of the world, especially in South
Korea and Turkey. While there was some damage in the United States,
we were mostly spared. The experts here said part of the reason for
that was, after Melissa, both businesses and individuals worked
hard to update their anti-virus software.
</P>
<P>
   But the resources aren't as great in countries such as South
Korea and Turkey. Chernobyl is a nasty virus all right _ it can
erase a hard disk in an instant. In the countries where it hit
hard, it disabled hundreds of thousands of computers, and it will
cost them megabucks to recover.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson _ to me at least _ is that if you have the money, the
skill and the technology and enough advance warning, you can
prevent computer problems like Chernobyl. But, if resources are
limited, even advance warning won't save you.
</P>
<P>
   By now you may see where I'm heading. While people are worrying
about Y2K disasters here, they may be ignoring the real cause for
worry. I wonder if Chernobyl furnished a dress rehearsal for what
things will be like when the New Year comes.
</P>
<P>
   The realities will be much the same, I'm afraid. Folks in the
United States, rich both in money and resources, have been working
around-the-clock to prevent Y2K disaster. Every reasonable expert I
talk to, including engineers responsible for our utility systems,
tells me they're ready. Systems have been tested and retested. And,
just in case they're wrong (engineers are cautious folk), manual
backup plans have also been tested.
</P>
<P>
   But in some other countries, there are more immediate problems_
like not enough to eat, antiquated computer systems, civil disorder
and massive poverty. While the computer professionals in these
countries may be just as smart and just as worried about Y2K, they
can't afford to throw the equivalent of billions of U.S. dollars at
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   That sets up the possibility that computer systems in poorer
countries will do all sorts of things come New Year's Eve _ none of
them pleasant. Let's not even talk about the really far-out
possibilities _ the computers that control weapons systems, for
instance. Instead, let's just think about the computers that handle
the routine bureaucracy of government.
</P>
<P>
   Things could rapidly move from pretty bad to really horrible in
a lot of these countries. And, unlike a virus attack, some of the
Y2K problems could linger for months and even years. And the United
States, long accustomed to bailing out its neighbors during bad
times, could find that even its deep pockets aren't enough.
</P>
<P>
   So if, like me, you want to worry, then worry about that.

 &HT;    Shoot-'em-up games teach about killing
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The events at Columbine High School appear to have
sent the nation into the deepest sort of soul-searching. Why did it
happen, and how can it be prevented?
</P>
<P>
   If the answers were easy, the problem would have been dealt with
long ago. And that's part of the answer _ the problem didn't exist
long ago.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a boy, you could mail-order guns. I had several. I
was also pretty miserable, but it never occurred to me that it
might be cathartic to wipe out my classmates. If it occurred to any
other kid in the 1950s, he didn't act on it.
</P>
<P>
   What's the difference, and what's that got to do with computers?
</P>
<P>
   I think those looking for answers would do well to read a book
called ``On Killing,'' by Lt. Col. Dave Grossman. Grossman is a
psychologist and military historian, and this rather dry and
scholarly book studies the act of killing and its effects on
soldiers at war.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman recounts how, in the waning days of World War II,
studies were conducted which showed that roughly 80 percent of
infantrymen in battle either never fired their weapons at all, or
fired them over the enemy's head. They could not bring themselves
to kill another human being.
</P>
<P>
   This, obviously, is an unsatisfactory state of affairs in the
military, so the Army's psychologists set about trying to find ways
to teach soldiers to overcome their distaste for killing. A few
years later, when hostilities broke out in Korea, the rate of
willing killers had gone up to about 50 percent. In Vietnam, it was
around 90 percent. This was accomplished, Grossman says, by making
a game out of killing.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, soldiers were taught to shoot by firing at
paper bull's-eyes. Thirty years later, they were shooting at
humanoid silhouettes that popped up, moved around, and fell over
gratifyingly when hit. Soldiers found it a very small step from
this training to the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman concludes his book with a chapter pointing out how well
the entertainment industry is applying these concepts. Nowadays a
single movie will waste more extras in the first 15 minutes than an
entire film studio wiped out in a year when I was a boy; the
killing is even choreographed in slow motion.
</P>
<P>
   Computer and video games are even worse. ``Doom'' inaugurated
the flood of first-person shooters. Everybody loved it. I loved it.
It seemed OK to me; our opponents were, after all, nasty-looking
aliens and monsters. It wasn't long, however, before the rush of
rip-off games presented perfectly human targets. Bad people,
presumably, but bad is often in the eye of the beholder. Games
proudly claim to have more blood and gore than their competition;
body parts are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   A policewoman told me just last week that she went out to buy
some Nintendo games for her son and was unable to find a single one
that didn't glorify violence. I can't speak for video games, but
there are plenty of fine computer games available with either no
violence at all, or violence reduced to abstract historical
battles.
</P>
<P>
   I would suggest that we need to pay close attention to our
children's computer entertainment. I think it's part of the
problem.

 &HT;    Include your car in spring cleaning
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wax on; wax off. No, I'm not auditioning for the next
``Karate Kid'' movie. Recent mild temperatures provided the perfect
opportunity to indulge in one of those traditional rites of spring
_ spring cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   The task I performed was not exactly what you'd classify as the
Martha Stewart treatment. Cobwebs will continue collecting dust and
the silver will have to stay tarnished for another weekend or so,
but my little Saturn looks and runs as well as she did four years
ago when I drove her out of the dealership.
</P>
<P>
   She got lots of neat presents for her birthday: new oil and
filter and special transaxle oil (I decided to treat her to Amsoil,
a synthetic lubricant). Her tires were rotated; the brakes, fluids,
belts, hoses, wiper blades and bulbs were inspected; door, hood and
trunk hinges were lubed. I added a can of fuel system treatment to
her gas tank.
</P>
<P>
   Once her mechanical needs were attended to, the real work began:
wax on, wax off.
</P>
<P>
   I attribute my Saturn's healthy good looks to this spring and
fall ritual. Although pine sap, bird mess and acid rain do their
best to destroy her glossy finish, we foil their attempts with our
special beauty treatment. I apply two coats of good paste wax to
the horizontal surfaces (hood, top and trunk) and a liquid wax on
the side fenders and doors. The bumpers and rubber trim receive a
liberal dose of vinyl protectant, and the windows are treated with
Rain-X.
</P>
<P>
   I've found the best applicators and polishing cloths to be
squares torn from old cotton flannel nightgowns and sheets. This
inexpensive source of soft rags allows me to change them frequently
so I don't risk scratching the paint with little flecks of dirt. I
don't know if there is any real scientific advantage to using two
coats of wax, but I figure it works on the same principle as
fingernail polish. Two coats wear longer.
</P>
<P>
   The interior of the car got its own personal spa treatment. The
windows and mirrors were washed. The upholstery, door panels and
carpets were vacuumed and spot-cleaned. I use a hose, laundry
detergent and a scrub brush on the mats and let them dry in the
sun. This scrubbing really attacks the accumulation of ground-in
dirt.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite cleaning tool for the A/C vents and those other
hard-to-reach nooks and crannies is a 2- or 3-inch paintbrush. The
long, soft bristles can get into crevices.
</P>
<P>
   A thorough wipe-down of the dash and the rest of the plastic
trim with a damp cloth, followed by an application of vinyl
protectant, completed the job.
</P>
<P>
   While I was sitting in the car, I checked to make sure my
current registration and insurance card were in the glove
compartment. We were stopped in a police road check a couple of
weekends ago in a car without these documents. What a mess, and a
ticket to boot!
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted after a day of rubbing and scrubbing, I gathered up my
cleaning supplies and paused to take a last look at my handiwork.
My little car looked beautiful. And you know what? I swear I could
see her smiling. I glanced over at our truck. He looked sort of
forlorn and forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the cobwebs will have to wait another week.

 &HT;    School violence: A pledge not to tease
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   High school students in Nashville created a pledge to help stop
violence in schools. But instead of promising not to use guns,
they're asking kids not to tease others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it'd be good just to encourage people to be nice
and not make others feel like outcasts, because (the killers in
Colorado) apparently felt like everybody was against them,''
Hillsboro High junior Rebecca Hunter says.
</P>
<P>
   Kids from around the country have signed. The pledge says:
</P>
<P>
   ``As a part of the community I WILL ...
</P>
<P>
   I will pledge to be a part of the solution.
</P>
<P>
   I will eliminate taunting from my own behavior.
</P>
<P>
   I will encourage others to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   I will do my part to make a safe place by being more sensitive
to others.
</P>
<P>
   I will set the example of a caring individual.
</P>
<P>
   I will eliminate profanity toward others from my language.
</P>
<P>
   I will not let my words or actions hurt others.
</P>
<P>
   ... and if others won't become part of the solution,
</P>
<P>
   I WILL.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO attacks increase
</P>
<P>
   The United States, along with its allies in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, increased attacks last week on Yugoslavia's
capital city, Belgrade. NATO jets blasted the Yugoslavian army
headquarters, government offices and neighborhoods close by.
</P>
<P>
   These were the strongest attacks on the capital since the NATO
bombings began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   NATO wants the president of Yugoslavia to make peace with
Kosovo, a region of his East European country. The Kosovar people
want to be independent, but Yugoslavia doesn't want them to secede.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, an American civil rights leader, and a
Russian leader are negotiating peace between NATO and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Smog season bad for kids
</P>
<P>
   Besides being baseball and pollen season, it's also officially
smog season in Georgia. Scientists at the Georgia Environmental
Protection Division have declared that May 1 through Sept. 30 is
when the pollution in our air can be worst for our health.
</P>
<P>
   Pollution, emitted by cars, factories and other sources, cooks
in sunlight, turning into smog. Because sunny days are often calm,
the smog sits above the city, making it difficult for people to
breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Kids are often affected the most because they play outdoors. For
children with asthma, smog can be especially bad.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: We are planning a long car trip this summer and I will need
to occupy myself by reading. But I am one of those people who gets
sick from reading or looking at pictures in a car. I have heard of
some device you put on your wrist and it prevents you from becoming
sick or nauseous. Do you know where I could get one of these?
</P>
<P>
   _A. Hamilton
</P>
<P>
   A: You are looking for Sea-Bands, sold in area pharmacies. You
might try this nondrug approach to curing motion sickness. No
guarantee it will work. Sea-Bands won't hurt you and they sell for
less than $10. Motion sickness is the conflict between your body
sensing the motion of the moving car and your eye working to
concentrate on the words on the page. A common cure for motion
sickness is to keep your eyes fixed on the horizon _ where the car
is going. Let me know if Sea-Bands work for you!
</P>
<P>
   Q: I received a Christmas gift of M&AMP;M cookies in a jar for all
my volunteer hours at my child's school. I have tried several
recipes and have not found the same texture cookie. My family wants
the recipe for M&AMP;M cookies in a jar. Can you help? _E. Emmons
</P>
<P>
   A: Glad your school efforts were recognized. Bravo! This is a
Jackie Gannaway recipe. Call Gannaway at 477-7070. ($3.95 plus tax,
add shipping if ordering from Gannaway.) Enjoy 23 cookie mixes and
three brownie mixes in this booklet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The term ``tank'' for a pond seems uniquely Texan. How did
the usage get started? _D.P.
</P>
<P>
   A: A tank is an artificial reservoir, pool or cistern. Texas has
only one major natural freshwater lake, Caddo Lake, according to
the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, so building
tanks and damming rivers is essential for an adequate water supply.
Texana expert Mike Cox says water-poor West Texas has many tanks,
and both tanks and ponds are commonly referred to as tanks. In East
Texas, where ponds probably outnumber tanks, ``pond'' is the term
used for both.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do birds really sing more in the spring, or do they just seem
to? _Susan M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yep, they sure do. Travis Audubon Society's John Kelly says
most of the singing is by males looking for mates (hear a few bars
of ``I'm in the Mood For Love''?) and warning other birds to stay
clear of their territory (all together now, ``This land is my land
...''). Spring is, after all, nesting season. The most versatile
avian chanter? The East Coast's brown thrasher. This relative of
the mockingbird sings more than 2,000 different phrases.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I enjoyed reading how round toothpicks are made. Now please
tell me how string cheese is made. _S.K.
</P>
<P>
   A: String cheese is mozzarella cheese in an interesting shape.
According to Greg Desautels, quality assurance manager for Saputo
Cheese USA, mozzarella has an inherent stringing property.
Technically, the cheese's milk proteins line up in straight lines
after the cheese is kneaded and heated. To make it string cheese,
taffy-like mozzarella cheese is pumped into an extrusion head
(think of a giant sieve). The cheese (about a half-inch thick)
comes out in long ropes. After being chopped into 4 1/2-inch
lengths, the string cheese is dropped in brine, cooled and
packaged.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I purchased a NewCom modem at Circuit City in April 1998. I
mailed in the $30 rebate offer but have yet to receive it. The Los
Angeles Better Business Bureau said they've stopped taking
complaints about NewCom because of poor response. How I can get my
rebate check? _Kyle Stubbings
</P>
<P>
   A: I think you can kiss the rebate goodbye. After several chats
with NewCom (not an easy place to contact), I received a letter
from NewCom's attorney (J.C. Fedalen, Sabo &AMP; Green, 23801 Calabasas
Road, Suite 1015, Calabasas, Calif. 91302) stating, ``NewCom is ...
resolving the rebate issue by way of a stipulation and settlement
in a lawsuit ... rebates will be paid under the auspices of the
Court.'' The Los Angeles BBB is accepting complaints about NewCom
(the tally: 36 complaints, 16 satisfied, 1 unresolved, 19 ignored
or pending). Send your complaint to the LABBB, P.O. Box 970,
Colton, Calif. 92324. Q: I have a moderately sized collection of
brass and would like to clean it and store it. I had thought I
could wrap it in paper towels and then seal it in storage bags. Do
you have any suggestions as to how to store it and not have it
tarnish? _Gloria Eckstrom
</P>
<P>
   A: Darren Wicker of Austin Brass recommends wrapping the brass
items in cloth (old sheets?) before placing them in plastic.
Tarnish is retarded by limited exposure to air. The plastic will
help do that. However, Wicker warns not to let the plastic touch
the brass, especially if the brass is lacquered. Lacquered brass
should never be stored in hot areas such as attics or garages.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A short time ago there was an obituary that included a very
moving snippet from a poem: ``... and when he shall die, take him
and cut him out in little stars, and he will make the face of
heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night ...''
A few years ago I lost my own beautiful adult son. After that
dreadful event I began writing poetry of my own. Can you find out
the poet and title and where I can find the poem? _O.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``And pay no worship to the garish sun.'' Act III, Scene 2
from William Shakespeare's ``Romeo and Juliet.'' This popular
passage is spoken by Juliet opining in the Capulet orchard.
</P>
<P>
   Contact Jane Greig, author of ``Thanks for Asking,'' at P.O. Box
670, Austin, TX, 78767; (512) 445-3697; e-mail

 &HT;    Digging into gardening easy on Web
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The World Wide Web is a perfect place for your next
garden.
</P>
<P>
   It is, after all, the world's largest library for gardening
information. Almost any topic _ from information on rare plants to
the most basic tips for planting a radish seed _ is available, with
photographs, at the click of a mouse. And since this is the right
time of the year for planting in most areas, we'll take a walk
through some of the best gardening sites today.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start at the Garden Gate at garden-gate.prairienet.org/.
You'll be pleased with how easy it is to search for specific
information. The site practically takes you by the hand. Just press
on the link that says ``Finding Answers,'' and you'll get automated
help in finding the gardening information you want. And that search
help isn't limited to this site, but covers the entire Web.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, suppose your search is a simple one ... you want
to find out about day lilies. Then you'll be offered a list of
general sites. But for more esoteric information, Garden Gate will
point you toward some search engines that will take you further. Or
if you have a specific question, you'll be taken to areas where
experts answer direct questions. There also are links to chat
areas.
</P>
<P>
   There also are photo tours of some of the world's most beautiful
gardens.
</P>
<P>
   There's something really appealing about the next site from Ohio
State University. It's called Web Garden and is located at
www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/webgarden.html. Here you'll find links to
Web pages created by students at the school's class that teaches
the use of computers for horticultural management. These are sites
worth an A. You'll find plenty of topics represented here,
including creating a cutting garden, garden photography, several
related to landscaping yards and developing healthy grass, and one
called ``Japanese Gardens for Morons like Me.''
</P>
<P>
   The next site, called Virtual Garden, also has some fine
databases of specific plant information. But one thing that sets
this site _ located at www.vg.com/ _ apart is the basic gardening
information you'll find. If you're just starting out and need help
in the simplest things _ everything from finding the right tools
for gardening, to learning how to prepare the soil and find the
plants that are best for your area _ you'll get it here.
</P>
<P>
   Beginners also will like the Gardening by Mail area of this
site. That's where you'll find ways to contact the garden suppliers
that you'll need.
</P>
<P>
   Our last stop on the garden tour is actually a department within
a larger site called Home Arts. The section is called Bloom!
(homearts.com/depts/garden/00gardc1.htm) and has many of the
features offered by the other sites. We'll talk about two of them.
One really nifty area of this site is called Seed Swap.

   It's a lot of fun. Just press on the link and leave a note
offering a specific seed or asking for one. If you have a special
interest in a rare plant, it's a great way to meet others who feel
the same way. Do keep in mind however, that you'll need to exercise
all the usual cautions a prudent person would take when meeting
strangers on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The other area that merits praise is one that lets you select a
specific month from a pull-down menu. Then you'll get reminders for
the specific chores that are appropriate for that time of the year.

 &HT;    Stock analyst uses PC, touts Apple
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even some of those who don't use Macs are falling in
love with Apple Computer. Take Kevin Prigel, a confirmed PC user
and investment analyst at StreetAdvisor.com.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent analysis published on StreetAdvisor's Web site,
Prigel says he's learned to love Apple Computer because of its
soaring stock price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, the Apple Computer story keeps getting better,''
wrote Prigel. ``After beating earnings estimates by a sound 7
percent when every other box maker has been missing estimates, this
company looks poised for a great run.''
</P>
<P>
   Prigel based his comment on seven analytical points.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Prigel said that, since the rollout of the iMac
last August, Apple Computer's sales have increased roughly 10
percent every quarter. That adds up to a whopping 46 percent jump
in sales on an annualized basis, Prigel calculated.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of computer companies increase sales only to see their
profit margins fall through price cutting. Not Apple Computer. Its
gross profits increased 121 percent in the first quarter from the
same period a year earlier, concluded Prigel.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a company that lost nearly $2 billion two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Prigel contends that users no longer care what operating system
is running on their computers _ as long as they can run the
programs they want or need. With Microsoft's commitment to keep
making current versions of its popular software for Macs, Apple's
computers are now on a level playing field with Windows machines,
says Prigel.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Microsoft's Office 98 for the Mac includes features not
yet included in the Windows version of the leading business package
of software titles.
</P>
<P>
   Another Apple Computer strength, says Prigel, is the ease with
which its computers connect to the Internet. He says that no
computers connect faster. ``With an iMac, an inexperienced user can
plug in a power cord and phone line and be online in minutes,''
writes Prigel.
</P>
<P>
   In conclusion, Prigel says, ``Since (Steve Jobs) took over with
Apple Computer floundering, the company has done nothing but
innovate. Believe in Steve Jobs as you would believe in Gates.''
</P>
<P>
   Prigel makes several other points, which you can read for
yourself. His article is fairly easy to follow, even for someone
who is neither a businessman nor an investor.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find the article on the Net at
www.streetadvisor.com/spot/042299/01.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Prigel, by the way, uses a Dell computer and says has no
intention of changing. At least for now.

 &HT;    Don't blame Internet for kids' bad behavior
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ About a decade ago, in my hometown of Leominster,
Mass., two girls from my high school went home together after
school. Then they took a shotgun down from over the fireplace, went
up to a bedroom, put on some Jimi Hendrix and shot themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, everyone blamed Hendrix.
</P>
<P>
   The local and national media converged on our town, putting up
huge satellite dishes in front of my school for our 15 minutes of
morbid fame. They wrote soul-searching articles on disaffected
youth in local and national newspapers. Quite a lot of time and
videotape was spent trying to find something to blame, some outside
influence that could have caused two teen-age girls to end their
lives one day after school.
</P>
<P>
   In the '90s, two troubled high school students in Colorado,
armed with more ammunition than some Third World countries, nearly
succeeded in their plan to murder everyone at Columbine High. In
the aftermath of this horrifying tragedy, the media once again is
searching for something to blame. This time it was their clothes,
the music they liked, the video games they played and the books
they read.
</P>
<P>
   When it was revealed they liked computers, everyone blamed the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   According to a ``Dateline NBC'' poll, 16 percent of adults
surveyed said that limiting teen-agers' access to the Internet
would keep teen-agers from feeling lonely, depressed and isolated.
Limited Web access will keep the jocks from picking on them and
somehow make the high school experience bearable.
</P>
<P>
   I beg to differ.
</P>
<P>
   There were troubled kids before there was an Internet, and there
will be troubled kids long after the Internet becomes as quaint as
the radio or the newspaper. Amazon.com is not Earth's biggest
bookstore; instead it's the Internet itself. The Internet is the
biggest repository of information and misinformation ever
collected. For every disturbed kid asking Lycos to find
bomb-building sites, there are kids reading up on Kosovo, applying
to college, chatting with friends, taking ``How to tell if he/she
likes you'' quizzes or watching the ``Star Wars'' trailer for the
sixth or seventh time. Some of them are building Web sites that
include pictures of the family pet or a recent vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Not every kid with a Web site or Net access wants to blow up his
high school or glorify Hitler. Try a Yahoo! search for Leonardo Di
Caprio or Claire Danes and you'll find numerous fan pages built by
teens devoted to their favorite movie and music stars. Before there
were computers, their grandparents were doing the same thing _
making hard-copy scrapbooks of their favorite stars.
</P>
<P>
   Most teens and any adult worth talking to will tell you that
high school can be a painful experience even for the most
well-adjusted teen. High school can leave emotional scars that take
years to heal. I have friends still harboring grudges against the
person who beat them out for the lead in the spring musical, stood
them up on prom night or drove cooler cars.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of kids, I spent a lot of time listening to rock
music, watching TV, hanging out at the mall and talking to my
friends on the phone. There were lots of things I was sure my
parents, as much as they loved me, just wouldn't understand. But
even during my worst years of teen-age misery, I never once
considered blowing up my school, not because I didn't have America
Online to corrupt me, but because I knew it was wrong, and as black
as things may have seemed sometimes, I never thought that violence
was the answer to my problems.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reasons, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold believed it
was the answer to theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, The New York Times and CNN are on the Web, but so is page
after page of material devoted to every radical fringe group
imaginable. For a troubled teen looking for something, anything to
latch onto, these sites validate their darkest, most disturbing
thoughts and feelings.
</P>
<P>
   But don't use the Internet as a catch-all excuse for everything
wrong with the kids today. If Harris didn't have Net access, he'd
have found other ways to carry out the massacre he had spent more
than a year planning.
</P>
<P>
   Harris may have had access to a vast store of information,
violent video games and Gothic music videos. It seems the one thing
he did not have and desperately needed was access to a network of
adults and peers who could help him cope with his violent feelings,
his despair and his rage. To borrow from William Shakespeare, ``The
fault lies not in the Web, but with ourselves.''

 &HT;    Don't forget Mother's Day
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mother's Day is Sunday. Do you have a plan? You don't
have to buy expensive things to make your Mom feel special. You can
draw her a picture, write her a poem or sing her a song. You can
clean your room, help make dinner or wash the dog. And there's
always Mom's favorite gift: Saying you love her and you appreciate
all that she does! For a special Mom award, check
www.billybear4kids.com/holidays/mother/mom.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Shorter showers help the Earth
</P>
<P>
   For years you've told your parents you really can get clean in
less than three minutes. Now, you've got proof. The U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency recommends taking a shower that is
five minutes or less to help preserve our water supply. This week
is National Drinking Water Week and there's more you can do to
protect this natural resource. Turn off water while you're brushing
your teeth, turn water on and off while washing your dog or your
parent's car and water your plants at night.
</P>
<P>
   Hungry for knowledge
</P>
<P>
   Ever eat your homework? Now you can with the edible science
experiments at www.madsci.org/experiments. There are dozens of
experiments broken down into Earth Sciences, Mathematics, Chemistry
and more. You can taste such things as Cheese Fractures, The Cat's
Meow and Food Batteries. Many of the experiments require common
household items. Click on a file to find age requirements and
safety measures. Some of the experiments are inedible (which means
don't eat them!).

 &HT;    Kosovo children, families flee homes to find safety
 &HT;    By Keith Still
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Camping out in tents with no school for weeks may
sound like a dream come true. But for more than 300,000 Kosovo
kids, it's a nightmare that just won't end.
</P>
<P>
   These kids and their families are refugees _ people who have
left their homes for safety. They began fleeing Kosovo, a region of
Yugoslavia, a month ago. The Yugoslavian army and Serbian police
entered their towns and forced them out.
</P>
<P>
   With no time to pack, they ran for safety to neighboring
countries like Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro. They traveled any
way they could _ in cars, on tractors, by foot _ and battled
freezing weather and treacherous terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, many kids got separated from their families and
some were orphaned. Those who escaped are living in refugee camps
waiting to return to what's left of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The really lucky ones have clean water nearby, but all of them
are stranded in foreign countries at the mercy of relief workers
and local residents.
</P>
<P>
   While everyone wonders what's going to happen next, many of the
children still are struggling with what happened. They don't know
why they had to leave home, why their families were beaten or
killed or why they now have to live in tents with few supplies.
</P>
<P>
   These refugees are the latest casualties of disputes that have
been raging in this part of Europe, known as the Balkan Peninsula,
for 600 years. The mostly Muslim ethnic Albanians make up 90
percent of Kosovo's population. They want their independence from
Yugoslavia. Orthodox Christian Serbs make up the other 10 percent.
However, Serbs are the majority in the rest of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The groups practice two very different religions, speak two very
different languages and celebrate different cultures. But they both
believe that Kosovo belongs to them. The bombings, the other
violence and the losses can have a long-lasting impact on children.
Relief organizations like UNICEF are doing their best to make life
in the refugee camps as comfortable as possible for the kids. Some
camps have set up schools, while others have pitched tents where
kids can come to draw, talk, get counseling or medical help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about fancy stuff, just getting them to hold
hands and sing, to play games, little running exercises,'' Carol
Bellamy, executive director of UNICEF, told reporters after she
returned from the region a few weeks ago.

 &HT;    Server is the traffic cop for a home network
 &HT;    By Gerry Yandel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As Paul Harvey says: ``And now for the rest of the
story ...''
</P>
<P>
   Several readers sent e-mail to warn me there is more to setting
up my in-home network than slapping some cable into an Ethernet hub
and wiring all the machines together.
</P>
<P>
   I had planned to write about what else it takes to split one
cable modem throughout the house. After all, I am learning a lot of
this stuff as I go, just as many of you are. But there's no sense
in putting off the inevitable. Let's talk about setting up a
network server.
</P>
<P>
   In order to simultaneously use one Internet provider address,
you'll have to make one of the machines on your network a traffic
cop and communicate with the other machines on your local area
network. In the simplest of terms, this means that one of your
machines will have to be able to talk to the rest of the machines
in your house. It will also allow all the machines to share a
single IP address, by letting you assign them all a secondary
address on your network.
</P>
<P>
   Your server software then acts as a translator between your
Internet provider and your own network, assigning the proper
packets of data to the proper IP addresses.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, say your son is online in his room playing
``Doom'' and you are online doing your banking in the den. The
server will send the packets of ``Doom'' data to the IP address in
the bedroom and the data from the bank's Web server to the IP
address in the den.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious way to set up your server is to buy a cheap PC
to be used only as a server and stash it with the cable modem. As
far as server software goes, there are several flavors and versions
available.
</P>
<P>
   Some readers suggested using Linux, some versions of which come
with Apache server software, but I am not quite at that juncture
yet. It's a learning curve I have been avoiding. (I did buy myself
RedHat 5.2 for Christmas, and I had a great time installing it. But
that's as far as I got.) One reader swears by the ``Linux Edge
Router,'' a small server and Linux kernel that'll run off a floppy
disk. It seemed straightforward enough to a Linux neophyte like
myself.
</P>
<P>
   Another reader suggested Wingate 3.0. A version called Wingate
Home is priced at $39.95 for three users and $69.95 for six users.
</P>
<P>
   The type of software you decide upon will dictate the hardware
required for your server. Linux Edge, like pretty much all
Linux-based servers, runs off a 486 with 16 megabytes of RAM.
Windows NT, obviously, requires a bit more power and, therefore, a
more expensive machine. Wingate Home works with Win95, 98 and NT,
and there are several other products out that will allow you to set
up a server in those operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   It also isn't necessary to have a separate server set up. Any of
your primary computers could also function as the server.
</P>
<P>
   But, with the cheap prices of 486s and Pentiums, there's no
reason not to get a machine to use solely as a server, and it's
probably more advantageous to have a separate server. Having a
machine functioning solely as a server will also bypass problems of
not having enough PCI slots and IRQs for your two Ethernet cards in
one machine.
</P>
<P>
   Also realize that an in-home network is not only for cable modem
sharing. One reader wrote about his in-home network of five
machines all sharing a 33.6 modem.
</P>
<P>
   Even when all five machines are online simultaneously, they get
acceptable access, he writes, although there can be a noticeable
performance drain if some of them are doing packet-intensive work.

 &HT;    On a budget? Don't ignore Buick Century
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Are you one of those people who has champagne taste
but a beer budget?
</P>
<P>
   Do you sometimes need space for six adults? Would you really
like the image that goes with a premium, upscale brand?
</P>
<P>
   Reality _ like that for a lot of us _ is that your final
purchase decision is dictated by your budget.
</P>
<P>
   You might want to glance in a direction you might not have
considered _ the Buick Century.
</P>
<P>
   With more youthful, contemporary styling and a host of standard
equipment and innovative design features, the midsize Century has
more trunk space and more interior room than any other car in its
segment, Buick says. It might be a luxury car the masses can
afford.
</P>
<P>
   Standard vehicle pricing begins at $20,145, but a fully equipped
model that includes leather seating, six-way power front seats,
rear seat armrest, cruise control, auto-dimming rearview mirror and
premium-grade stereo with cassette/CD player and
steering-wheel-mounted stereo controls can be had for around
$23,500.
</P>
<P>
   The Century's 3.1-liter V-6 provides ample power, while at the
same time offering 20 mpg around town and up to 29 on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   All-speed traction control is now standard not only on the
Century but on all Buicks. The Buick system works in both forward
and reverse by regulating the engine output to enable traction on
wet roads or in sand, snow or gravel. Four-wheel anti-lock brakes
are also standard.
</P>
<P>
   A really neat feature is the tire inflation monitor. An
indicator on the dash notifies the driver that a tire is losing or
has lost air. It requires an average drop of 8-10 psi to trigger
the monitor, but the warning should enable the driver who has
picked up a slow leak or experienced a minor puncture to be able to
get the tire repaired before it is permanently damaged. It also
will alert those of us who have the bad habit of never checking
their air pressure that it is time to pump the black doughnuts back
up.
</P>
<P>
   A low-pressure tire is much more likely to suffer a failure than
a properly inflated one.
</P>
<P>
   Another timely feature is the Century's air filtration system,
which automatically reduces pollen before it reaches the car's
interior. With pollen numbers in some areas currently off the
scale, this feature alone should be worth a test drive during
pollen season.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line, the Buick Century is a pleasant car with upscale
amenities that keep your tires on their toes and allow your nose to
breath cleaner air and at a price that many budgets can handle _
all with a premium badge on the grille.

 &HT;    Common Windows 98 problems exposed
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Windows 98 is such a massive program that you can
never know enough about it. And that fact has produced good fodder
for the PC magazine industry. Take the May issue of PC Computing.
Its cover story is called ``Undocumented Window Secrets.'' Sounds
like the title of some show on the Fox network, doesn't it? Hype
aside, this article offers plenty of helpful hints. The article
identifies 15 common problems with Windows 98. They include such
things as slow Internet connections, clocks that lose time and
disappearing files. The article offers suggestions how to fix these
problems and more.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just corporate computer networks that are threatened by
the Y2K glitch. Many applications you keep on your home computer
are threatened, too. The May issue of PC Computing offers some
guidelines on how to kick the millennium bug off your home desktop
computer.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   There apparently is an unofficial movement under way by the
computer industry to digitize every classic board game. Leading the
charge is Hasbro Interactive. In its latest efforts, the company
has released two collections on computer CD. One is a title called
``Board Games,'' which features some of the best board games. Those
games include chess, checkers, pente, dominoes and connect four. On
the card collection title, called ``Card Games,'' you'll find
spades, cribbage, hearts and gin rummy, among many others. Both of
these CDs are available only for Windows computers.
</P>
<P>
   At last, there's a computer CD about animals that doesn't
involve shooting them. WizardWorks has released a new computer CD
called ``Bird Watcher,'' which calls itself ``an interactive
birding game.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bird Watcher,'' players view photos and video clips of
birds. And there's a game in which you play a raptor as it hunts
for rabbits and fish. ``Bird Watcher'' is available only for PCs
running Windows 95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   Learn about the amazing complexity of the planet _ and learn
what is at risk because of a growing number of endangered plant and
animal species. National Geographic has set up a site that explores
this issue through picture, text and sound. You'll find the site at

 &HT;    Site gets credit for its advice
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's May, and that New Year's resolution to eliminate
your credit debt is sucking wind.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's help online: www.creditpage.com is a Web site
devoted to managing and mitigating your credit debt, brought to
you, in part, by credit card companies and banks.
</P>
<P>
   CreditPage starts with an online test to help gauge the depth of
your credit card addiction. From there, you check your credit
report, find a local credit counselor, read up on your rights as a
borrower and view answers to frequently asked questions.
</P>
<P>
   The site was launched last month, in time for National Credit
Education Week, which was April 18-24.
</P>
<P>
   The site is sponsored by the National Foundation for Consumer
Credit, Debt Counselors of America, the National Council on
Economic Education, the JumpStart Coalition for Personal Finance
Literacy, Genus Credit Management, Money Management International,
Personal Debt Solutions, the Forms Group, Bank of America,
MasterCard International and Visa.

<P>
   Bill-paying blues
</P>
<P>
   It might be the wave of the future. But for now, the people who
pay their bills with their PCs are a byte on a floppy disk.
</P>
<P>
   A bill-payment study from Synergistics Research shows that 79
percent of the people polled pay their bills the old-fashioned way:
They mail them. Thirty percent of the people asked also pay bills
in person, at the biller's office. An almost equal amount _ 29
percent _ arrange for an automatic deduction from their bank
account. Six percent pay at an ATM, 5 percent transfer funds by
telephone and 2 percent use their PC.
</P>
<P>
   The study concludes that billers need to start marketing the PC
option a bit more aggressively, because paying bills by PC has
little appeal if you can't get your bills by PC.
</P>
<P>
   Synergistics Research, based in Atlanta, surveyed 1,100 people
in March.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the study found 40 percent of consumers asked had
some sort of problem with their regular bill-paying method: usually
delays in mail delivery, the time and effort used, and the cost of
postage.
</P>
<P>
   The study found 40 percent of consumers had PCs in their homes.
Of those, 70 percent are on the Web an average of 10 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   For sale by owner
</P>
<P>
   You've decided to bypass real estate agents and their hefty
commissions and sell your own home. But there are still a few
questions left. Like, how much should you sell it for? And what are
some quick and simple things you can do to create a good first
impression?
</P>
<P>
   Check out www.audrie.com, a site designed to guide a
do-it-yourself home seller through the process without a real
estate agent. The site covers everything from touch-up painting to
what to expect from an inspection to creating a ``for sale'' flier
with the help of an online composer.

 &HT;    Don't waste that Y2K worrying on the wrong things
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If there were awards for worrying, you'd see my
picture on the cover of Time magazine accepting the trophy for
being the world champion.
</P>
<P>
   And today I worry you are worried about the wrong things when it
comes to the Year 2000 computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   You'll see a lot of hype about what it can mean to computers in
the United States. I was driving in South Georgia the other day and
saw a billboard that advertised a ``Y2K preparedness gun show.''
This stuff is too weird for me to make up.
</P>
<P>
   There are people, not just in my home state, who are worried
sick about water supplies failing, planes crashing, electrical
grids going dark. Banks are having seminars for their customers _
in fact, that's where I was heading when I saw the billboard _
urging them not to take money out of the bank and bury it in the
back yard because of Y2K fears.
</P>
<P>
   Like I said, I think it's a classic case of worrying about the
wrong thing. To explain why I believe that, we'll have to start
with Melissa.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, the virus called Melissa caught most of the
computing world by surprise and caused all sorts of problems. It
snuck in on an e-mail attachment and then invaded both business and
home computers, causing them to send Microsoft Word documents as
e-mail from the target computer to up to 50 folks. That sort of
traffic choked the Internet and probably embarrassed the heck out
of a lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   Well, no one likes to be caught by surprise. So most folks _
both in the computing business and in the media that cover it _
spent a lot of time worrying about that happening again. When it
came time for a virus called Chernobyl to be triggered (on the
April 26 anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster), TV
and the newspapers were full of dire reports of what could happen.
</P>
<P>
   What happened in this country was ... not much. It was a
different story in other parts of the world, especially in South
Korea and Turkey. While there was some damage in the United States,
we were mostly spared. The experts here said part of the reason for
that was, after Melissa, both businesses and individuals worked
hard to update their anti-virus software.
</P>
<P>
   But the resources aren't as great in countries such as South
Korea and Turkey. Chernobyl is a nasty virus all right _ it can
erase a hard disk in an instant. In the countries where it hit
hard, it disabled hundreds of thousands of computers, and it will
cost them megabucks to recover.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson _ to me at least _ is that if you have the money, the
skill and the technology and enough advance warning, you can
prevent computer problems like Chernobyl. But, if resources are
limited, even advance warning won't save you.
</P>
<P>
   By now you may see where I'm heading. While people are worrying
about Y2K disasters here, they may be ignoring the real cause for
worry. I wonder if Chernobyl furnished a dress rehearsal for what
things will be like when the New Year comes.
</P>
<P>
   The realities will be much the same, I'm afraid. Folks in the
United States, rich both in money and resources, have been working
around-the-clock to prevent Y2K disaster. Every reasonable expert I
talk to, including engineers responsible for our utility systems,
tells me they're ready. Systems have been tested and retested. And,
just in case they're wrong (engineers are cautious folk), manual
backup plans have also been tested.
</P>
<P>
   But in some other countries, there are more immediate problems_
like not enough to eat, antiquated computer systems, civil disorder
and massive poverty. While the computer professionals in these
countries may be just as smart and just as worried about Y2K, they
can't afford to throw the equivalent of billions of U.S. dollars at
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   That sets up the possibility that computer systems in poorer
countries will do all sorts of things come New Year's Eve _ none of
them pleasant. Let's not even talk about the really far-out
possibilities _ the computers that control weapons systems, for
instance. Instead, let's just think about the computers that handle
the routine bureaucracy of government.
</P>
<P>
   Things could rapidly move from pretty bad to really horrible in
a lot of these countries. And, unlike a virus attack, some of the
Y2K problems could linger for months and even years. And the United
States, long accustomed to bailing out its neighbors during bad
times, could find that even its deep pockets aren't enough.
</P>
<P>
   So if, like me, you want to worry, then worry about that.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: We are planning a long car trip this summer and I will need
to occupy myself by reading. But I am one of those people who gets
sick from reading or looking at pictures in a car. I have heard of
some device you put on your wrist and it prevents you from becoming
sick or nauseous. Do you know where I could get one of these?
</P>
<P>
   _A. Hamilton
</P>
<P>
   A: You are looking for Sea-Bands, sold in area pharmacies. You
might try this nondrug approach to curing motion sickness. No
guarantee it will work. Sea-Bands won't hurt you and they sell for
less than $10. Motion sickness is the conflict between your body
sensing the motion of the moving car and your eye working to
concentrate on the words on the page. A common cure for motion
sickness is to keep your eyes fixed on the horizon _ where the car
is going. Let me know if Sea-Bands work for you!
</P>
<P>
   Q: I received a Christmas gift of M&AMP;M cookies in a jar for all
my volunteer hours at my child's school. I have tried several
recipes and have not found the same texture cookie. My family wants
the recipe for M&AMP;M cookies in a jar. Can you help? _E. Emmons
</P>
<P>
   A: Glad your school efforts were recognized. Bravo! This is a
Jackie Gannaway recipe. Call Gannaway at 477-7070. ($3.95 plus tax,
add shipping if ordering from Gannaway.) Enjoy 23 cookie mixes and
three brownie mixes in this booklet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The term ``tank'' for a pond seems uniquely Texan. How did
the usage get started? _D.P.
</P>
<P>
   A: A tank is an artificial reservoir, pool or cistern. Texas has
only one major natural freshwater lake, Caddo Lake, according to
the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, so building
tanks and damming rivers is essential for an adequate water supply.
Texana expert Mike Cox says water-poor West Texas has many tanks,
and both tanks and ponds are commonly referred to as tanks. In East
Texas, where ponds probably outnumber tanks, ``pond'' is the term
used for both.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do birds really sing more in the spring, or do they just seem
to? _Susan M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yep, they sure do. Travis Audubon Society's John Kelly says
most of the singing is by males looking for mates (hear a few bars
of ``I'm in the Mood For Love''?) and warning other birds to stay
clear of their territory (all together now, ``This land is my land
...''). Spring is, after all, nesting season. The most versatile
avian chanter? The East Coast's brown thrasher. This relative of
the mockingbird sings more than 2,000 different phrases.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I enjoyed reading how round toothpicks are made. Now please
tell me how string cheese is made. _S.K.
</P>
<P>
   A: String cheese is mozzarella cheese in an interesting shape.
According to Greg Desautels, quality assurance manager for Saputo
Cheese USA, mozzarella has an inherent stringing property.
Technically, the cheese's milk proteins line up in straight lines
after the cheese is kneaded and heated. To make it string cheese,
taffy-like mozzarella cheese is pumped into an extrusion head
(think of a giant sieve). The cheese (about a half-inch thick)
comes out in long ropes. After being chopped into 4 1/2-inch
lengths, the string cheese is dropped in brine, cooled and
packaged.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I purchased a NewCom modem at Circuit City in April 1998. I
mailed in the $30 rebate offer but have yet to receive it. The Los
Angeles Better Business Bureau said they've stopped taking
complaints about NewCom because of poor response. How I can get my
rebate check? _Kyle Stubbings
</P>
<P>
   A: I think you can kiss the rebate goodbye. After several chats
with NewCom (not an easy place to contact), I received a letter
from NewCom's attorney (J.C. Fedalen, Sabo &AMP; Green, 23801 Calabasas
Road, Suite 1015, Calabasas, Calif. 91302) stating, ``NewCom is ...
resolving the rebate issue by way of a stipulation and settlement
in a lawsuit ... rebates will be paid under the auspices of the
Court.'' The Los Angeles BBB is accepting complaints about NewCom
(the tally: 36 complaints, 16 satisfied, 1 unresolved, 19 ignored
or pending). Send your complaint to the LABBB, P.O. Box 970,
Colton, Calif. 92324. Q: I have a moderately sized collection of
brass and would like to clean it and store it. I had thought I
could wrap it in paper towels and then seal it in storage bags. Do
you have any suggestions as to how to store it and not have it
tarnish? _Gloria Eckstrom
</P>
<P>
   A: Darren Wicker of Austin Brass recommends wrapping the brass
items in cloth (old sheets?) before placing them in plastic.
Tarnish is retarded by limited exposure to air. The plastic will
help do that. However, Wicker warns not to let the plastic touch
the brass, especially if the brass is lacquered. Lacquered brass
should never be stored in hot areas such as attics or garages.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A short time ago there was an obituary that included a very
moving snippet from a poem: ``... and when he shall die, take him
and cut him out in little stars, and he will make the face of
heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night ...''
A few years ago I lost my own beautiful adult son. After that
dreadful event I began writing poetry of my own. Can you find out
the poet and title and where I can find the poem? _O.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``And pay no worship to the garish sun.'' Act III, Scene 2
from William Shakespeare's ``Romeo and Juliet.'' This popular
passage is spoken by Juliet opining in the Capulet orchard.
</P>
<P>
   Contact Jane Greig, author of ``Thanks for Asking,'' at P.O. Box
670, Austin, TX, 78767; (512) 445-3697; e-mail
jgreig(at)statesman.com or fax (512) 445-3968.

 &HT;    Shoot-'em-up games teach about killing
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The events at Columbine High School appear to have
sent the nation into the deepest sort of soul-searching. Why did it
happen, and how can it be prevented?
</P>
<P>
   If the answers were easy, the problem would have been dealt with
long ago. And that's part of the answer _ the problem didn't exist
long ago.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a boy, you could mail-order guns. I had several. I
was also pretty miserable, but it never occurred to me that it
might be cathartic to wipe out my classmates. If it occurred to any
other kid in the 1950s, he didn't act on it.
</P>
<P>
   What's the difference, and what's that got to do with computers?
</P>
<P>
   I think those looking for answers would do well to read a book
called ``On Killing,'' by Lt. Col. Dave Grossman. Grossman is a
psychologist and military historian, and this rather dry and
scholarly book studies the act of killing and its effects on
soldiers at war.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman recounts how, in the waning days of World War II,
studies were conducted which showed that roughly 80 percent of
infantrymen in battle either never fired their weapons at all, or
fired them over the enemy's head. They could not bring themselves
to kill another human being.
</P>
<P>
   This, obviously, is an unsatisfactory state of affairs in the
military, so the Army's psychologists set about trying to find ways
to teach soldiers to overcome their distaste for killing. A few
years later, when hostilities broke out in Korea, the rate of
willing killers had gone up to about 50 percent. In Vietnam, it was
around 90 percent. This was accomplished, Grossman says, by making
a game out of killing.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, soldiers were taught to shoot by firing at
paper bull's-eyes. Thirty years later, they were shooting at
humanoid silhouettes that popped up, moved around, and fell over
gratifyingly when hit. Soldiers found it a very small step from
this training to the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman concludes his book with a chapter pointing out how well
the entertainment industry is applying these concepts. Nowadays a
single movie will waste more extras in the first 15 minutes than an
entire film studio wiped out in a year when I was a boy; the
killing is even choreographed in slow motion.
</P>
<P>
   Computer and video games are even worse. ``Doom'' inaugurated
the flood of first-person shooters. Everybody loved it. I loved it.
It seemed OK to me; our opponents were, after all, nasty-looking
aliens and monsters. It wasn't long, however, before the rush of
rip-off games presented perfectly human targets. Bad people,
presumably, but bad is often in the eye of the beholder. Games
proudly claim to have more blood and gore than their competition;
body parts are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   A policewoman told me just last week that she went out to buy
some Nintendo games for her son and was unable to find a single one
that didn't glorify violence. I can't speak for video games, but
there are plenty of fine computer games available with either no
violence at all, or violence reduced to abstract historical
battles.
</P>
<P>
   I would suggest that we need to pay close attention to our
children's computer entertainment. I think it's part of the
problem.

 &HT;    Include your car in spring cleaning
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wax on; wax off. No, I'm not auditioning for the next
``Karate Kid'' movie. Recent mild temperatures provided the perfect
opportunity to indulge in one of those traditional rites of spring
_ spring cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   The task I performed was not exactly what you'd classify as the
Martha Stewart treatment. Cobwebs will continue collecting dust and
the silver will have to stay tarnished for another weekend or so,
but my little Saturn looks and runs as well as she did four years
ago when I drove her out of the dealership.
</P>
<P>
   She got lots of neat presents for her birthday: new oil and
filter and special transaxle oil (I decided to treat her to Amsoil,
a synthetic lubricant). Her tires were rotated; the brakes, fluids,
belts, hoses, wiper blades and bulbs were inspected; door, hood and
trunk hinges were lubed. I added a can of fuel system treatment to
her gas tank.
</P>
<P>
   Once her mechanical needs were attended to, the real work began:
wax on, wax off.
</P>
<P>
   I attribute my Saturn's healthy good looks to this spring and
fall ritual. Although pine sap, bird mess and acid rain do their
best to destroy her glossy finish, we foil their attempts with our
special beauty treatment. I apply two coats of good paste wax to
the horizontal surfaces (hood, top and trunk) and a liquid wax on
the side fenders and doors. The bumpers and rubber trim receive a
liberal dose of vinyl protectant, and the windows are treated with
Rain-X.
</P>
<P>
   I've found the best applicators and polishing cloths to be
squares torn from old cotton flannel nightgowns and sheets. This
inexpensive source of soft rags allows me to change them frequently
so I don't risk scratching the paint with little flecks of dirt. I
don't know if there is any real scientific advantage to using two
coats of wax, but I figure it works on the same principle as
fingernail polish. Two coats wear longer.
</P>
<P>
   The interior of the car got its own personal spa treatment. The
windows and mirrors were washed. The upholstery, door panels and
carpets were vacuumed and spot-cleaned. I use a hose, laundry
detergent and a scrub brush on the mats and let them dry in the
sun. This scrubbing really attacks the accumulation of ground-in
dirt.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite cleaning tool for the A/C vents and those other
hard-to-reach nooks and crannies is a 2- or 3-inch paintbrush. The
long, soft bristles can get into crevices.
</P>
<P>
   A thorough wipe-down of the dash and the rest of the plastic
trim with a damp cloth, followed by an application of vinyl
protectant, completed the job.
</P>
<P>
   While I was sitting in the car, I checked to make sure my
current registration and insurance card were in the glove
compartment. We were stopped in a police road check a couple of
weekends ago in a car without these documents. What a mess, and a
ticket to boot!
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted after a day of rubbing and scrubbing, I gathered up my
cleaning supplies and paused to take a last look at my handiwork.
My little car looked beautiful. And you know what? I swear I could
see her smiling. I glanced over at our truck. He looked sort of
forlorn and forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the cobwebs will have to wait another week.

   1. TOURISM IN SPACE : NOT SUCH A FAR-OUT IDEA Honeymoons on the
moon may still be some time off, but vacation trips to an orbiting
hotel are much nearer to reality. Participants in a recent
conference on space tourism learned that plans are well advanced
for such a sky-high hotel, where a week's stay (transportation and
meals included) could cost $250,000. Work is already under way on
an international space station, a step toward space tourism, and
both governmental engineers and private firms are developing
reusable launchers that could bring the cost of a space trip down
to the (almost) affordable -- about the cost of a luxury car.

HIGH DEFINITION TV COMING INTO FOCUS
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color photo of a HDTV in a store and a sidebar of the
history of TV 
 By JAY HANDELMAN 
 c.1999 NYT Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember when everyone gathered around the neighbor's new
television set to see what Little Joe looked like in ''living
color?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, some 40 years later, television is taking another
technological leap.
</P>
<P>
   High-definition television, with its sharp focus and
three-dimensional feel, debuted in last November when network
affiliates in the nation's 10 biggest cities were mandated by the
federal government to begin digital broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   At its digital-signal best, HDTV will provide the kind of
picture quality that can make you feel as if you're sitting on the
50-yard line of a football game or on the sidelines of a parade.
</P>
<P>
   But not many consumers are going to be taking advantage of these
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers with ordinary, analog sets will see no change in their
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   And, like all new electronic devices, the outsized HDTV sets are
expensive, costing anywhere from $4,000 to $22,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who take the plunge will have to wait a while for
HDTV programming to become widely available.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, satellite customers are the only ones who can
make regular use of the improved signals, along with those who
watch movies in a new digital format called DVD.
</P>
<P>
   But experts say that the HDTV revolution will be as dramatic as
the switch from black and white to color, and will sneak up on
America's television-addicted populace.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's coming sooner than you think,'' said Stephen L. Rogers,
president and chief executive officer of WEDU-Ch. 3, the public
television station in Tampa, Fla. ''We have until 2003 to be
broadcasting in high definition, and the commercial stations in
(most cities) have to do it by 2002.''
</P>
<P>
   The changeover is the first upgrade to the broadcast television
standard in more than 40 years. While it will eventually make
obsolete an estimated 240 million television sets, the new standard
also will increase the quality of communication and bring the
information superhighway into every home, even those without
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The new sets and digital signals will bring CD quality sound and
restore the at-home viewer's peripheral vision.
</P>
<P>
   Most stations are scheduled to turn off their analog signals in
2006. Consumers who haven't bought a new TV by then will need a
converter box to watch their old (or non-HDTV) sets.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-two stations across the country were the first to begin
high definition broadcasts in October with the launch of the space
shuttle Discovery carrying John Glenn back into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between analog TV, which exists now, and digital
TV is in the nature of the signal used to beam the TV channel. An
analog transmitter turns light and sound into radio waves. A
digital transmitter turns light and sound into a series of 1s and
0s, the same kind of coding that computers use to process data.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said his station will have to raise about $10 million to
install all new equipment ''down to every last cable and plug'' to
handle the new format.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers don't have to go that far, but they will have to get
at least two pieces of new equipment.
</P>
<P>
   One is a conversion box that will adapt the signal coming into
the home (via satellite, over the air or, eventually, via cable)
and turn it into a much richer, sharper and more colorful picture,
along with a higher quality of sound. The box resembles a
videocassette recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the new television set, which at the moment runs
large but will eventually come in all sizes, said Tom Cannon, a
salesman at a Sarasota, Fla., Sound Advice store. Because of the
improved sound, many customers may also want to get more advanced
speakers or surround-sound setups.
</P>
<P>
   On a display at his store, Cannon can show customers clips of a
football game on a 50-inch Mitsubishi set so clear it seems as if
you're transported to the stadium. On a nearby wall is a 50-inch
letterbox-shaped plasma television set that is about 4 inches deep
and hangs on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ''These televisions are going to change the way people set up
their homes,'' said Cannon, who also has an 80-inch high definition
television on display.
</P>
<P>
   The price of HDTVs is expected to decline markedly over the next
decade, much as the cost of calculators, PCs, video cassette
recorders and camcorders did after several years on the retail
market.
</P>
<P>
   Color televisions, introduced in the 1960s, first sold for the
equivalent of $2,100 in today's dollars. Now, an average color TV
runs about $500.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers with high definition sets and converter boxes will be
able to pick up the signals from local broadcast stations directly
over the air with an antenna.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'll either get a sharp, clear and crisp signal or you won't
get anything. There won't be any snow or fuzzy pictures in HDTV,''
Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   But most television viewers now watch through cable, and the
National Cable Television Association estimates that companies will
spend $33 billion over the next few years to upgrade their systems
to handle the greater band width required by HDTV.
</P>
<P>
   Cable systems haven't rushed to upgrade because there aren't
clear standards out there about what converter boxes for HDTV will
be like.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will HDTV offer consumers high quality pictures and
sounds, but it also offers the potential for even more channel
choices because the signals use a greater band width.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a television station may choose to use all its band
width for one channel, or it could divide the signal, with lesser
quality, to provide programming options.
</P>
<P>
   WEDU, Rogers said, may offer children's programs on part of its
signal and public affairs on another, or contributors to the
station may be able to watch a channel without pledge-break
interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of options open to us,'' Rogers said. ''And
for the consumer, the possibilities are really amazing.''

`MUMMY'S' GIRL: RACHEL WEISZ HEADS FOR ADVENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 Includes a color slide of Rachel Weisz with Brendan Fraser in a
scene from ``The Mummy.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Making movies can be a real pain in the ...
 &HT;    Well, let Rachel Weisz tell it.
 &HT;    ``I've still got a scar there,'' the actress says with a laugh.
``You can get incredibly sore bouncing up and down on a camel.''
 &HT;    Camel-bouncing was only one of many new experiences endured by
Weisz _ an art-house regular whose films include ``Stealing
Beauty'' (1996) and ``The Land Girls'' (1998) _ in making
writer/director Stephen Sommers' ``The Mummy.'' For the film, which
will open May 7, Weisz _ it's pronounced ``vice'' _ also found
herself acting opposite dubbed-in-later special effects, performing
hair-raising stunts and, oh yes, having rats crawling on her chest.
 &HT;    Yet, despite the popcorn-movie trappings, the 28-year-old
British actress swears by her character _ Evelyn, a prim and
proper, albeit clumsy librarian who joins legionnaire Rick
O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) on a quest across Egypt that involves
treasure seekers, archaeologists, locusts, man-eating scarabs,
ancient curses and a certain slow-walking creature (Arnold Vosloo)
inadvertently awakened from a 3,000-year-long slumber.
 &HT;    ``The women in these action/adventures are so often marginal,
and that wasn't the case here,'' she says. ``Stephen Sommers
created a wonderful character.
 &HT;    ``Evelyn is smart, funny and sexy, and she gets to be a real
part of this adventure,'' Weisz adds. ``It was for that reason
that, going in, I thought `The Mummy' could be a good experience.
I've gotten a lot of ridiculous scripts where there was no thought
whatsoever given to creating an original, unusual, real-life woman.
 &HT;    ``For `The Mummy' to work, for any comic-book-genre movie to
work in 1999, you can't just have a pathetic damsel in distress
floating about. It would be silly.''
 &HT;    ``The Mummy'' was filmed in England and on location in the
Sahara, where temperatures soared to 130 degrees. Some days she
fled invisible sand storms, bugs or mummies to be added later,
while others were spent kissing Fraser or lying manacled to a stone
table.
 &HT;    ``Somehow I didn't feel like a cog in a machine,'' Weisz says
during a conversation at the Intercontinental Hotel in London.
``There were a lot of effects in the film, for sure, but several of
us shared those scenes ... When you're doing so much with other
people, with the camera right there, you can't really feel like a
cog.''
 &HT;    Weisz particularly enjoyed conveying Evelyn's burgeoning
sexuality.
 &HT;    ``It's in the vein of Lois Lane,'' says the actress, equal parts
fetching and demure in a bright-pink T-shirt, cream cardigan and
gray-lace skirt. ``She takes off her glasses and she's suddenly
sexy.
 &HT;    ``That's archetypical comic-book stuff, to go from hair in a
bun, spectacles and a buttoned-up shirt to a more sexy woman in a
nightdress running around the desert. It was really fun.''
 &HT;    Evelyn's metamorphosis won't surprise Weisz fans. The actress
turned up the heat as a bitchy anti-virgin in ``Stealing Beauty,''
starred in the barely released ``I Want You'' (1998) as a woman in
a ``sick, obsessional relationship'' and is currently heading the
cast of a steamy West End revival of Tennessee Williams' ``Suddenly
Last Summer.''
 &HT;    ``I'm only too comfortable with sexuality,'' Weisz says
unashamedly. ``I was brought up on black-and-white movies. I grew
up with Elizabeth Taylor, Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn, who
were witty, sexy and glamorous, often at the same time.
 &HT;    ``Women do themselves harm when they think they can't be sexy
and be taken seriously,'' the actress says. ``Obviously, some of
the concerns about people's reactions cross my mind. I think, `God,
must I clamp my breasts down to be taken seriously in this part?'
 &HT;    ``I think everybody uses their sexuality, to some extent, to get
what they want in life,'' she adds. ``Personally, I don't go to the
lengths of some of my characters _ I've played several unhealthy,
not wholesome women.''
 &HT;    Weisz leans forward.
 &HT;    ``But they are fascinating characters to explore,'' she says.
``I do not want to play those roles all the time. They can be
upsetting to have in your head.''
 &HT;    Just because her best previous work has been in independent
films, Weisz says, is no reason to assume that she won't turn up in
Hollywood epics.
 &HT;    ``The only things I want from any film are a character, script,
director and actors that interest me,'' she says. ``That may be a
lot to ask, big or small budget!''
 &HT;    She laughs.
 &HT;    ``Really, the only difference between a big-budget film and a
small one is the craft services and your trailer's size _ which are
not that fulfilling _ and the amount of time you have to shoot,
which can be important.
 &HT;    ``What I've done so far is just a reflection of what I like.''
 &HT;    Weisz has ventured onto action-movie turf once before. ``Chain
Reaction'' (1996), co-starring Keanu Reeves and directed by Andrew
Davis, director of the smash hit ``The Fugitive'' (1993), was a
prototypical blockbuster wannabe. But it received a critical
thrashing and bombed at the box office.
 &HT;    The actress starts to try to be diplomatic, fumbles for words
and then shrugs. ``The hell with it,'' the gesture seems to say.
 &HT;    ``I had no idea what was going on,'' she says candidly. ``It was
my second film. I was running around with Keanu in the snow.
 &HT;    ``It was an interesting script,'' she adds, ``and the concept of
trying to find a new energy source was of interest to me.
Unfortunately, they cut the movie's first 20 minutes, where they
set up my character and Keanu's character _ apparently the studio
decided the explosions had to happen sooner.
 &HT;    ``So you didn't give a f--k about these characters,'' she says
bluntly. ``You didn't know who they were, and it was senseless.''
 &HT;    If they had made the movie they set out to make, she suggests,
it might have fared better.
 &HT;    ``When we were making it, Andrew Davis said he wanted the movie
to be about real people and a real event,'' she says. ``He wanted
the characters to be in danger, and didn't want Keanu or me to be
superhuman. It worked on `The Fugitive,' but it somehow didn't work
on `Chain Reaction.'''
 &HT;    Weisz, who is committed to ``Suddenly Last Summer'' through
July, will next be seen on screen opposite Ralph Fiennes in a
drama, ``A Taste of Sunshine.'' Another art-house film,
``Sunshine'' follows three generations of a Hungarian Jewish family
from the 1860s to the 1950s.
 &HT;    It's very much in the vein of Weisz's pre-``Mummy'' movies,
ample proof _ if any were needed _ that the London resident has no
plans to go Hollywood.
 &HT;    ``I can fly into Hollywood to meet directors,'' she says. ``I'm
very happy for Hollywood to take the films I'm in, but I don't have
to live there.
 &HT;    ``I've never even made a film in Hollywood.''
 &HT;    Her greatest interest, the self-confident Weisz makes clear, is
to ensure the longevity of her career. This entails making good
movies, even at the cost of the chance to do successful movies, she
believes.
 &HT;    ``I hope to be acting when I'm 70,'' she says. ``I don't know if
living in L.A. and going to the openings of envelopes wearing
low-cut dresses are what take you through for the long run.
 &HT;    ``Maybe I'm just too practical and I'll be proven totally
wrong.''

STAR-QUIZ: THE QUESTIONS ARE OUT THERE 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 Includes a color slide of Jake Lloyd in a scene from ``Star Wars:
The Phantom Menace.'' 
 By S. BURELISON  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It didn't start with ``Star Wars.''
 &HT;    In fact, the science-fiction craze of the last 20 years actually
began by looking backward, when novice director George Lucas, still
working on his first film, turned to composer Lalo Schifrin and
said, ``I want to do Flash Gordon.''
 &HT;    Ultimately he couldn't get the rights to the famous 1930s
science-fiction serial, but he caught a lot of its spirit in three
subsequent films. You may have heard of them _ ``Star Wars''
(1977), ``The Empire Strikes Back'' (1980) and ``Return of the
Jedi'' (1983).
 &HT;    Now, as the long-awaited fourth ``Star Wars'' movie, ``The
Phantom Menace'' _ it's a prequel, so they're calling it ``Episode
1'' _ swoops toward theaters, there's never been a better time to
check your knowledge of classic film science fiction.
 MOONSTRUCK  
 &HT;    The first movie spaceship took off in French filmmaker George
Melies' 1902 film ``Le Voyage dans la Lune (Voyage to the Moon).''
Space travel was faster then _ its astronauts take only 14 minutes
to cover the round trip.
 &HT;    In 1904, Melies directed the first two-reel movie, ``Voyage a
Travers l'impossible (Impossible Voyage).'' The title was
well-chosen _ a group of people travel to the sun by train, with no
need for special training, equipment or clothing.
 &HT;    Since then, of course, space travel has become a staple of film
science fiction. Test your star-trekking knowhow with these
relatively simple questions:
 &HT;    1. What catchy turn-of-the-century American song is HAL-9000,
the deranged computer of ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' (1968), singing
as ``he'' dies?
 &HT;    2. In the popular ``Flash Gordon'' serials, who was Flash's
adjective-enhanced nemesis?
 &HT;    3. ``In space, no one can hear you scream'' was the
scientifically accurate but dramatically irrelevant tag line used
to promote what 1979 space-going thriller?
 &HT;    4. In ``Dune'' (1984), characters travel to the sandy planet of
Arrakis to recover what precious commodity?
 GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER?  
 &HT;    In 1947, an American pilot named Kenneth Arnold spotted nine of
what he called flying discs over the state of Washington. An
enterprising journalist referred to them as flying saucers, and
soon bug-eyed monsters were under every bed.
 &HT;    The classic film in the genre is, of course, ``Invasion of the
Body Snatchers'' (1956), in which aliens grown in giant pods
replace the residents of a California town _ picture-perfect but
devoid of personalities. Widely recognized as a metaphor for the
Red-hunting, ultra-conformist 1950s, the film has been remade
several times in various guises, but never so well.
 &HT;    Until the next wookkie rings your doorbell, test your knowledge
of visitors from outer space with these brain-teasers:
 &HT;    5. What finally defeats the aliens in the classic ``War of the
Worlds'' (1953)?
 &HT;    6. How does the awesome Klaatu (Michael Rennie) demonstrate his
power to world leaders in ``The Day the Earth Stood Still'' (1951)?
 &HT;    7. Where is ``The Blob'' (1958) finally cornered and captured?
 &HT;    8. How does young Elliott (Henry Thomas) lure a reluctant alien
out of hiding in ``E.T. _ The Extra-Terrestrial'' (1982)?
 HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE BOMB  
 &HT;    The dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki set the
whole world quivering _ most parts of it in fear, but Hollywood in
excitement at the glimpse of a new plot staple.
 &HT;    Radiation gone wild was the theme of choice for the 1950s, and
not only in America. In fact, the classic of the genre may be a
product of Japan _ the definitive giant-dinosaur movie,
``Godzilla'' (1954).
 &HT;    But nature has been striking back ever since. Try your hand at
these bigger-than-life questions _ and don't worry, none of them
concern the genre's nadir, the rampaging-bunnies epic ``Night of
the Lepus'' (1972):
 &HT;    9. What are _ or is it ``is?'' _ ``Them!'' (1954)?
 &HT;    10. What title monster was played by two men sharing a latex
suit _ Ricou Browning under water and Ben Chapman on land?
 &HT;    11. In ``The Day of the Triffids'' (1963), what are triffids and
what's especially dangerous about them?
 &HT;    12. What made ``The Incredible Shrinking Man'' (1957) shrink?
 THE SOURCE OF THE FORCE ... OF COURSE  
 &HT;    From the very beginning, a science-fiction film has been only as
good as its special effects. Sci-fi audiences want to see things
they've never seen before, and from cardboard rockets on strings to
computer-synthesized, digitally enhanced space creatures, Hollywood
has been only too eager to oblige.
 &HT;    George Lucas' ``Star Wars'' changed the rules, however, and his
company Industrial Light and Magic has seen to it that they stayed
changed, providing breathtaking effects for scores of movies in the
intervening decades.
 &HT;    How well do you know the ``Star Wars'' universe? Try these
questions on for size:
 &HT;    13. What's so unusual about the sky on Luke Skywalker's home
planet of Tatooine?
 &HT;    14. Where did Han Solo (Harrison Ford) get his spaceship, the
star-spanning Millennium Falcon?
 &HT;    15. Besides the three ``Star Wars'' feature films, there was one
television movie based on the series. What was it?
 &HT;    16. Who played Darth Vader in all three ``Star Wars'' movies?
 &HT;    17. Where did Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) first meet Han Solo?
 &HT;    18. What does Yoda tell Luke he must do in order to become a
true Jedi knight?
 &HT;    19. Only one actor in the original ``Star Wars'' films won an
Oscar, before or since. Who?
 &HT;    20. Where on earth would you go to find a place that looked like
Tatooine? 
 -0- 
 THE STAR-TLING ANSWERS  
 &HT;    1. HAL renders ``Daisy,'' with its all-too-true chorus, ``I'm
half crazy ... ''
 &HT;    2. Flash Gordon dueled the interplanetary tyrant Ming the
Merciless.
 &HT;    3. ``Alien'' reminded us that sound doesn't travel through outer
space _ but took place mostly aboard a starship, where an
artificial atmosphere made possible ample screaming.
 &HT;    4. Arrakis is the source of a rare spice, melange.
 &HT;    5. The Martian invaders in this H.G. Wells adaptation are immune
to earthly guns, bombs and even atomic weapons _ but not to human
germs, which wipe them out.
 &HT;    6. Klaatu gets his audience's attention by causing a 30-minute
power failure _ worldwide.
 &HT;    7. The Blob is finally trapped in a diner. In the 1988 remake,
incidentally, it's a skating rink.
 &HT;    8. Elliott made friends with the lost E.T. by plying him with
Reese's Pieces candy.
 &HT;    9. ``Them'' are radiation-mutated giant ants.
 &HT;    10. It took the combined efforts of Browning and Chapman to
embody ``The Creature From the Black Lagoon'' (1954).
 &HT;    11. Triffids are carnivorous plants _ think immense venus
flytraps. Unlike flytraps, however, triffids can move from place to
place.
 &HT;    12. Most sci-fi radiation seems to make small things huge, but
Grant Williams' character encounters a cloud of radioactive mist
and finds himself incredibly shrinking.
 &HT;    13. Tatooine is located in a binary system, with two suns.
 &HT;    14. Solo won the Falcon in a bet with Lando Calrissian (Billy
Dee Williams), the raffish governor of Cloud City, as revealed in
``The Empire Strikes Back.''
 &HT;    15. ``The Ewok Adventure'' aired in 1984 on ABC, and focused on
the furry, tree-dwelling creatures who first appeared in ``Return
of the Jedi.''
 &HT;    16. It's a trick question: While James Earl Jones supplied the
voice, the man in the Sith Lord's costume was actor David Prowse.
Actor Sebastian Shaw was the face of Darth Vader, but appeared only
in ``Return of the Jedi.''
 &HT;    17. Luke first meets Solo in a cantina on Tatooine _ think a
waterfront bar frequented by some seriously weird sailors.
 &HT;    18. To become a Jedi knight, Luke must confront Darth Vader _
enough reason for the average student to drop out.
 &HT;    19. Alec ``Obi-Wan Kenobi'' Guinness won the Best Actor Oscar
for ``The Bridge on the River Kwai'' (1957).
 &HT;    20. ``Star Wars'' _ and the new ``Phantom Menace'' _ were filmed

THE LEGEND IN WINTER: ROD STEIGER ON MOVIES, HOLLYWOOD AND

 Includes a color slide of Rod Steiger in a scene from ``Crazy in
Alabama.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    One of Hollywood's longest-running feuds is over.
 &HT;    For 45 years Rod Steiger hated Marlon Brando's guts, and that's
the way he liked it.
 &HT;    It all stemmed from one of the most famous movie scenes of all
time, the ``I coulda been a contender'' scene in ``On the
Waterfront'' (1954).
 &HT;    ``You know that taxi scene in `On the Waterfront?''' Steiger
says. ``Well, Marlon wasn't there when I did my close-ups. And
because acting is reacting, I never got over it.''
 &HT;    But last year Steiger was in Montreal to receive a
lifetime-achievement award and received a ``wonderful telegram''
from ... Brando.
 &HT;    After his speech, Steiger was handed a note with an invitation
and directions to a small Chinese restaurant on the outskirts of
town.
 &HT;    ``And who is sitting there at a table but Mr. Brando,'' Steiger
recalls. ``I said to myself, `I guess you've got to go over there
and thank him for his damn telegram.'
 &HT;    ``So I walked up to the table and said, `Marlon!''' he says.
``We gave big hugs, and I rubbed his bald head against my bald
head.
 &HT;    ``And then I said, `I'm really sorry you sent me the telegram,
because now I can't say any more rotten things about you!'''
 &HT;    Steiger laughs. It's a sparkling spring day in Los Angeles, and
the actor is sitting on his back patio, overlooking the Pacific
Ocean.
 &HT;    If the man notorious as the most ornery guy in Hollywood seems
uncharacteristically mellow, it's no wonder. He's happy to be here
today, working and alive, after an eight-year bout with crippling
clinical depression that rendered him all but bedridden.
 &HT;    ``I was sick for eight years,'' he says, ``and I never thought I
would make it back ... I just didn't care anymore.''
 &HT;    Five years ago, and with the aid of new medication, he began to
feel better.
 &HT;    ``There wasn't a major turning point where you think, `I've got
this thing licked,''' he says. ``You come back as gradually as you
left. I just found that one day I was more interested in life.
 &HT;    ``One of the first things that dies in a clinical depression is
your curiosity,'' he adds. ``I'm talking about everything from
watching how an ant crawls across a piece of wood to greater and
more important things. I finally got my curiosity back.''
 &HT;    Which was all well and good, but a far cry from acting in major
motion pictures.
 &HT;    ``I wondered if I could still act,'' Steiger admits. ``It was
like starting all over again for me. I worried that I wouldn't be
able to remember a line.''
 &HT;    For the Oscar-winning actor, veteran of such film classics as
``On the Waterfront,'' ``Oklahoma'' (1956), ``The Pawnbroker''
(1965) and ``Dr. Zhivago'' (1965), the stakes were high. There was
nothing he could take for granted, including the response of a new
Hollywood generation which had mostly forgotten him or assumed him
dead.
 &HT;    ``The only thing that saved me is that I did pretty good work in
the past and my movies were on television,'' the actor says. ``The
younger people began to say, `Hey, he's pretty good. Who is
that?'''
 &HT;    The result is a revived career that in recent months has
included work on the upcoming Arnold Schwarzenegger action film
``End of Days,'' as well as roles in Antonio Banderas' directorial
debut ``Crazy in Alabama'' and in ``Lazarus and the Hurricane,''
Denzel Washington's biopic of controversial boxer Rubin
``Hurricane'' Carter.
 &HT;    He's also completed a straight-to-video sequel to his 1997 film
``Shiloh,'' and even signed to direct his first movie,
``Thanksgiving.''
 &HT;    Not bad for a 74-year-old.
 &HT;    ``I have two cars,'' he explains. ``My license plate on one car
says `Courage,' and the other car says `Keep Moving.' And that's
what you've got to do. You've got to get out of the bed. You've got
to force yourself at any age.''
 &HT;    ``End of Days'' casts Steiger as a priest _ ``the nice guy for
once,'' he says _ facing a visit by Satan to New York at the turn
of the millennium.
 &HT;    He didn't have to research the role of a priest, the actor adds,
or delve into Satanism.
 &HT;    ``I hate to bring it up,'' he says, ``but I did do a terrible
movie called `The Amityville Horror'' (1979), where I did the most
difficult scene in my entire life. I had to sit still while they
poured beer and sugar on me. And then they unleashed all these
flies. Because, you know, when the devil comes, I guess flies are
supposed to arrive, too.
 &HT;    ``I could only hold the scene for a minute,'' he adds. ``The
tickling drove me nuts.''
 &HT;    ``Thanksgiving'' is a different kind of ticklish project _ a
low-budget drama about three aging gay men who have differing
Thanksgiving dinners.
 &HT;    ``It's rather funny,'' Steiger says, ``but it's not campy. But
then it gets to be tragic.''
 &HT;    He'd hoped for a cast that would include himself, James Garner
and Sidney Poitier, his co-star in his Oscar-winning ``In the Heat
of the Night'' (1967).
 &HT;    ``But Jimmy is busy,'' he says, frowning. ``Sidney is an
ambassador to something, so forget it.''
 &HT;    In other words, casting gay roles isn't easy, which came as no
surprise to Steiger.
 &HT;    ``I remember when I did `The Sergeant' (1968) many years ago,
about a master sergeant in the army who falls in love with this new
young guy he has working in the office,'' he recalls. ``I heard,
`You better be careful, Rod. Oh my God! You won't work again.' And
I yelled back, `I know what goes on in my bedroom, my friend. I'm
not worried about it.'''
 &HT;    The ornery Steiger of old resurfaced earlier this year, when it
was announced that Elia Kazan, his director for ``On the
Waterfront'' and a former friendly witness before the House
Un-American Activities Committee, would receive an honorary Oscar.
 &HT;    ``I didn't think he should get anything,'' Steiger snorts. ``If
I killed somebody when I was 13, when I was 93 I still killed them.
He killed careers.
 &HT;    ``I knew people during that time who didn't survive,'' the actor
adds angrily. ``Kazan hurt people to the point where people's
children couldn't go to school or college. No way did he deserve an
award.
 &HT;    ``He sacrificed other people's happiness for his ambitions.''
 &HT;    It isn't Kazan's name that most often turns up linked with
Steiger's in the news, of course. That would be Elizabeth Taylor,
the actress he insists is just a ``good friend.''
 &HT;    ``They've tried to make us a romance for years,'' he says. ``As
I said to somebody, `If you can have a romance with a woman in a
brace from her breasts to her hips, tell me how you did it.'''
 &HT;    Well, but Taylor isn't wearing the brace anymore.
 &HT;    ``Liz is getting better and better,'' Steiger concedes, ``but
that still doesn't mean we're having a romance. I've had four
marriages, thank you very much. My romantic days are over. I am now
a clinical advisor on love.''
 &HT;    Or is he?
 &HT;    ``I'm not really giving up,'' he says, chuckling. ``I mean, how
can you write off love when you're as physically attractive as I
am?
 &HT;    ``I'm more attractive than Liz,'' he adds with a laugh. ``When
we go out for lunch, I get all the attention.''

 Includes a color slide of David James Elliott with Catherine Bell
in a scene from ``JAG.'' 
 By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quick, name the show: The heroes are two government operatives,
a man and a woman who take their orders from a stern bald guy. They
travel the world, ferreting out hidden information and righting
wrongs while exuding a palpable-yet-unexpressed romantic chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and their series is currently enjoying its highest ratings
ever, routinely beating competing network shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files,'' you say? Close, but no cigar-shaped flying
object _ its ratings are actually down this season.
</P>
<P>
   A better guess would be ``JAG.'' The saga of Harmon ``Harm''
Rabb Jr. (David James Elliott) and Sarah ``Mac'' MacKenzie
(Catherine Bell), Marine attorneys in the Judge Advocate General
Corps, is in its fourth season and is only growing in popularity.
And, yes, it usually tops Mulder and Scully.
</P>
<P>
   Like the ``X-Files'' couple, Mac and Harm find themselves in a
position where they can look but not touch. Making the situation
all the more difficult is the fact that Mac resembles a girlfriend
of Harm's who was murdered.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bell played that role in a first-season episode, and
only joined the cast full-time in the series' second season. The
key was an impassioned letter she wrote to creator/executive
producer Donald Bellisario, insisting how good a fit she would be
for the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have that letter in my head in case I ever need it again,''
Bell says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   In stark contrast to Mulder and Scully, who are all but disabled
by neuroses, Harm and Mac wouldn't make a bad couple. But don't
expect a clinch anytime soon, Elliott warns.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be the kiss of death,'' he says. ``We've had
discussions about it. There was one scene where the writers wanted
to exploit that, and Catherine and I went for it. It ended up being
a little too much. They had to tone it down, and we reshot the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why, but any show that has done it, it's a signal
of the end,'' he adds. ``I guess there's nothing for people to look
forward to after that _ there's no conflict, no dynamic. Until that
happens, they can say, `Oh, wow, look what almost happened.'''
</P>
<P>
   In its early years, critics more or less ignored ``JAG,'' even
though creator Bellisario had been responsible for the wildly
successful ``Magnum: P.I.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to have the Hollywood liberal press against it,''
Elliott says. ``People perceived it as a little too patriotic.
There were a lot of obstacles from the beginning. People thought of
it as a military show, and some don't like military shows. It's a
regular drama with a military backdrop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our show is old-fashioned in a good sense, like TV used to
be,'' Bell adds. ``You think a little, you're entertained, there's
a nice, happy ending and good morals. It's not so edgy and
questioning of authority. It's just good people after good
ideals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are starting to notice that it's not a jingoistic
military drama,'' Elliott says. ``We're not anti-government _
there's good and bad everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military likes the show,'' the actor adds. ``They've
gotten over the fact that we're not making training films, and they
let us shoot on bases and aircraft carriers. That kind of
production value you can't rent anywhere. It'd be insane to assault
the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the show isn't afraid to take on difficult issues, and
the government isn't always the good guy. Critics are slowly coming
around and appreciating the show's political shades of gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``They try to show both sides of political debates,'' Bell says.
``The bottom line is, the good guy always wins. Whether the guy we
choose is in fact the good guy is sometimes up to debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott admits he bristles when given speeches he disagrees
with. When that happens, he adds, he doesn't hesitate to stand in
Harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say something,'' he says. ``They once had my character
stand up for something. I felt strongly about it, and I said, `I'm
not going to say it _ it would be ridiculous to take this stance.
So they gave the lines to another character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a political animal,'' he adds. ``This show is not a
soapbox for David James Elliott. But I have to remain true to the
character.''
</P>
<P>
   Another, more obvious way the series has won a larger audience
is by jacking up the action sequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do all my own stunts,'' Elliott says, ``and I've wound up
with more bruises _ I'm banged, punched, kicked, you name it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I much prefer to fight a stunt man than another actor,'' he
adds, ``because actors get their adrenaline going when they start
fighting _ they're really trying to sell the fight to the camera.
That's usually when you wind up getting hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``A professional's not going to hit you _ he's more concerned
with hiding his face.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott admits that an action show can get tedious after a
while, but adds that ``JAG'' isn't purely an action show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neat thing is, this is not one specific genre,'' he says.
``Every week, it's not another homicide investigation. One week
it's an action show, one week it's comedy _ we've done romance,
mystery, drama. That keeps it interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   When the shift toward action was announced, Bell says, she
insisted that she wanted to be in there mixing it up with the big
boys. She says she's gotten her wish.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have given me more _ more action, more dramatic stuff and
a little bit of humor,'' she says. ``It's been fun this season. The
only thing I'm not happy about is that Mac's been in uniform all
season, and I'm hoping to get her out of uniform. But we've been on
a sub or ship a lot this season, being very military.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of uniform as in wearing other clothes, that is, not without
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Mac to just break out of the military thing,'' Bell
says, smiling. ``I'd like to see Mac's wild side, what she's like
outside of JAG. I'd like to let her hair down and let her go a
little crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe she goes dancing _ maybe she takes salsa classes and has
this wild secret life.''
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, maybe she and Scully are in the same dance
class.
</P>

 Includes a color slide of Rachel Weisz with Brendan Fraser in a
scene from ``The Mummy.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Making movies can be a real pain in the ...
 &HT;    Well, let Rachel Weisz tell it.
 &HT;    ``I've still got a scar there,'' the actress says with a laugh.
``You can get incredibly sore bouncing up and down on a camel.''
 &HT;    Camel-bouncing was only one of many new experiences endured by
Weisz _ an art-house regular whose films include ``Stealing
Beauty'' (1996) and ``The Land Girls'' (1998) _ in making
writer/director Stephen Sommers' ``The Mummy.'' For the film, which
will open May 7, Weisz _ it's pronounced ``vice'' _ also found
herself acting opposite dubbed-in-later special effects, performing
hair-raising stunts and, oh yes, having rats crawling on her chest.
 &HT;    Yet, despite the popcorn-movie trappings, the 28-year-old
British actress swears by her character _ Evelyn, a prim and
proper, albeit clumsy librarian who joins legionnaire Rick
O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) on a quest across Egypt that involves
treasure seekers, archaeologists, locusts, man-eating scarabs,
ancient curses and a certain slow-walking creature (Arnold Vosloo)
inadvertently awakened from a 3,000-year-long slumber.
 &HT;    ``The women in these action/adventures are so often marginal,
and that wasn't the case here,'' she says. ``Stephen Sommers
created a wonderful character.
 &HT;    ``Evelyn is smart, funny and sexy, and she gets to be a real
part of this adventure,'' Weisz adds. ``It was for that reason
that, going in, I thought `The Mummy' could be a good experience.
I've gotten a lot of ridiculous scripts where there was no thought
whatsoever given to creating an original, unusual, real-life woman.
 &HT;    ``For `The Mummy' to work, for any comic-book-genre movie to
work in 1999, you can't just have a pathetic damsel in distress
floating about. It would be silly.''
 &HT;    ``The Mummy'' was filmed in England and on location in the
Sahara, where temperatures soared to 130 degrees. Some days she
fled invisible sand storms, bugs or mummies to be added later,
while others were spent kissing Fraser or lying manacled to a stone
table.
 &HT;    ``Somehow I didn't feel like a cog in a machine,'' Weisz says
during a conversation at the Intercontinental Hotel in London.
``There were a lot of effects in the film, for sure, but several of
us shared those scenes ... When you're doing so much with other
people, with the camera right there, you can't really feel like a
cog.''
 &HT;    Weisz particularly enjoyed conveying Evelyn's burgeoning
sexuality.
 &HT;    ``It's in the vein of Lois Lane,'' says the actress, equal parts
fetching and demure in a bright-pink T-shirt, cream cardigan and
gray-lace skirt. ``She takes off her glasses and she's suddenly
sexy.
 &HT;    ``That's archetypical comic-book stuff, to go from hair in a
bun, spectacles and a buttoned-up shirt to a more sexy woman in a
nightdress running around the desert. It was really fun.''
 &HT;    Evelyn's metamorphosis won't surprise Weisz fans. The actress
turned up the heat as a bitchy anti-virgin in ``Stealing Beauty,''
starred in the barely released ``I Want You'' (1998) as a woman in
a ``sick, obsessional relationship'' and is currently heading the
cast of a steamy West End revival of Tennessee Williams' ``Suddenly
Last Summer.''
 &HT;    ``I'm only too comfortable with sexuality,'' Weisz says
unashamedly. ``I was brought up on black-and-white movies. I grew
up with Elizabeth Taylor, Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn, who
were witty, sexy and glamorous, often at the same time.
 &HT;    ``Women do themselves harm when they think they can't be sexy
and be taken seriously,'' the actress says. ``Obviously, some of
the concerns about people's reactions cross my mind. I think, `God,
must I clamp my breasts down to be taken seriously in this part?'
 &HT;    ``I think everybody uses their sexuality, to some extent, to get
what they want in life,'' she adds. ``Personally, I don't go to the
lengths of some of my characters _ I've played several unhealthy,
not wholesome women.''
 &HT;    Weisz leans forward.
 &HT;    ``But they are fascinating characters to explore,'' she says.
``I do not want to play those roles all the time. They can be
upsetting to have in your head.''
 &HT;    Just because her best previous work has been in independent
films, Weisz says, is no reason to assume that she won't turn up in
Hollywood epics.
 &HT;    ``The only things I want from any film are a character, script,
director and actors that interest me,'' she says. ``That may be a
lot to ask, big or small budget!''
 &HT;    She laughs.
 &HT;    ``Really, the only difference between a big-budget film and a
small one is the craft services and your trailer's size _ which are
not that fulfilling _ and the amount of time you have to shoot,
which can be important.
 &HT;    ``What I've done so far is just a reflection of what I like.''
 &HT;    Weisz has ventured onto action-movie turf once before. ``Chain
Reaction'' (1996), co-starring Keanu Reeves and directed by Andrew
Davis, director of the smash hit ``The Fugitive'' (1993), was a
prototypical blockbuster wannabe. But it received a critical
thrashing and bombed at the box office.
 &HT;    The actress starts to try to be diplomatic, fumbles for words
and then shrugs. ``The hell with it,'' the gesture seems to say.
 &HT;    ``I had no idea what was going on,'' she says candidly. ``It was
my second film. I was running around with Keanu in the snow.
 &HT;    ``It was an interesting script,'' she adds, ``and the concept of
trying to find a new energy source was of interest to me.
Unfortunately, they cut the movie's first 20 minutes, where they
set up my character and Keanu's character _ apparently the studio
decided the explosions had to happen sooner.
 &HT;    ``So you didn't give a f--k about these characters,'' she says
bluntly. ``You didn't know who they were, and it was senseless.''
 &HT;    If they had made the movie they set out to make, she suggests,
it might have fared better.
 &HT;    ``When we were making it, Andrew Davis said he wanted the movie
to be about real people and a real event,'' she says. ``He wanted
the characters to be in danger, and didn't want Keanu or me to be
superhuman. It worked on `The Fugitive,' but it somehow didn't work
on `Chain Reaction.'''
 &HT;    Weisz, who is committed to ``Suddenly Last Summer'' through
July, will next be seen on screen opposite Ralph Fiennes in a
drama, ``A Taste of Sunshine.'' Another art-house film,
``Sunshine'' follows three generations of a Hungarian Jewish family
from the 1860s to the 1950s.
 &HT;    It's very much in the vein of Weisz's pre-``Mummy'' movies,
ample proof _ if any were needed _ that the London resident has no
plans to go Hollywood.
 &HT;    ``I can fly into Hollywood to meet directors,'' she says. ``I'm
very happy for Hollywood to take the films I'm in, but I don't have
to live there.
 &HT;    ``I've never even made a film in Hollywood.''
 &HT;    Her greatest interest, the self-confident Weisz makes clear, is
to ensure the longevity of her career. This entails making good
movies, even at the cost of the chance to do successful movies, she
believes.
 &HT;    ``I hope to be acting when I'm 70,'' she says. ``I don't know if
living in L.A. and going to the openings of envelopes wearing
low-cut dresses are what take you through for the long run.
 &HT;    ``Maybe I'm just too practical and I'll be proven totally
wrong.''

STAR-QUIZ: THE QUESTIONS ARE OUT THERE

entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of Jake Lloyd in a scene from ``Star Wars:
The Phantom Menace.'' 
 By S. BURELISON  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It didn't start with ``Star Wars.''
 &HT;    In fact, the science-fiction craze of the last 20 years actually
began by looking backward, when novice director George Lucas, still
working on his first film, turned to composer Lalo Schifrin and
said, ``I want to do Flash Gordon.''
 &HT;    Ultimately he couldn't get the rights to the famous 1930s
science-fiction serial, but he caught a lot of its spirit in three
subsequent films. You may have heard of them _ ``Star Wars''
(1977), ``The Empire Strikes Back'' (1980) and ``Return of the
Jedi'' (1983).
 &HT;    Now, as the long-awaited fourth ``Star Wars'' movie, ``The
Phantom Menace'' _ it's a prequel, so they're calling it ``Episode
1'' _ swoops toward theaters, there's never been a better time to
check your knowledge of classic film science fiction.
 MOONSTRUCK  
 &HT;    The first movie spaceship took off in French filmmaker George
Melies' 1902 film ``Le Voyage dans la Lune (Voyage to the Moon).''
Space travel was faster then _ its astronauts take only 14 minutes
to cover the round trip.
 &HT;    In 1904, Melies directed the first two-reel movie, ``Voyage a
Travers l'impossible (Impossible Voyage).'' The title was
well-chosen _ a group of people travel to the sun by train, with no
need for special training, equipment or clothing.
 &HT;    Since then, of course, space travel has become a staple of film
science fiction. Test your star-trekking knowhow with these
relatively simple questions:
 &HT;    1. What catchy turn-of-the-century American song is HAL-9000,
the deranged computer of ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' (1968), singing
as ``he'' dies?
 &HT;    2. In the popular ``Flash Gordon'' serials, who was Flash's
adjective-enhanced nemesis?
 &HT;    3. ``In space, no one can hear you scream'' was the
scientifically accurate but dramatically irrelevant tag line used
to promote what 1979 space-going thriller?
 &HT;    4. In ``Dune'' (1984), characters travel to the sandy planet of
Arrakis to recover what precious commodity?
 GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER?  
 &HT;    In 1947, an American pilot named Kenneth Arnold spotted nine of
what he called flying discs over the state of Washington. An
enterprising journalist referred to them as flying saucers, and
soon bug-eyed monsters were under every bed.
 &HT;    The classic film in the genre is, of course, ``Invasion of the
Body Snatchers'' (1956), in which aliens grown in giant pods
replace the residents of a California town _ picture-perfect but
devoid of personalities. Widely recognized as a metaphor for the
Red-hunting, ultra-conformist 1950s, the film has been remade
several times in various guises, but never so well.
 &HT;    Until the next wookkie rings your doorbell, test your knowledge
of visitors from outer space with these brain-teasers:
 &HT;    5. What finally defeats the aliens in the classic ``War of the
Worlds'' (1953)?
 &HT;    6. How does the awesome Klaatu (Michael Rennie) demonstrate his
power to world leaders in ``The Day the Earth Stood Still'' (1951)?
 &HT;    7. Where is ``The Blob'' (1958) finally cornered and captured?
 &HT;    8. How does young Elliott (Henry Thomas) lure a reluctant alien
out of hiding in ``E.T. _ The Extra-Terrestrial'' (1982)?
 HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE BOMB  
 &HT;    The dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki set the
whole world quivering _ most parts of it in fear, but Hollywood in
excitement at the glimpse of a new plot staple.
 &HT;    Radiation gone wild was the theme of choice for the 1950s, and
not only in America. In fact, the classic of the genre may be a
product of Japan _ the definitive giant-dinosaur movie,
``Godzilla'' (1954).
 &HT;    But nature has been striking back ever since. Try your hand at
these bigger-than-life questions _ and don't worry, none of them
concern the genre's nadir, the rampaging-bunnies epic ``Night of
the Lepus'' (1972):
 &HT;    9. What are _ or is it ``is?'' _ ``Them!'' (1954)?
 &HT;    10. What title monster was played by two men sharing a latex
suit _ Ricou Browning under water and Ben Chapman on land?
 &HT;    11. In ``The Day of the Triffids'' (1963), what are triffids and
what's especially dangerous about them?
 &HT;    12. What made ``The Incredible Shrinking Man'' (1957) shrink?
 THE SOURCE OF THE FORCE ... OF COURSE  
 &HT;    From the very beginning, a science-fiction film has been only as
good as its special effects. Sci-fi audiences want to see things
they've never seen before, and from cardboard rockets on strings to
computer-synthesized, digitally enhanced space creatures, Hollywood
has been only too eager to oblige.
 &HT;    George Lucas' ``Star Wars'' changed the rules, however, and his
company Industrial Light and Magic has seen to it that they stayed
changed, providing breathtaking effects for scores of movies in the
intervening decades.
 &HT;    How well do you know the ``Star Wars'' universe? Try these
questions on for size:
 &HT;    13. What's so unusual about the sky on Luke Skywalker's home
planet of Tatooine?
 &HT;    14. Where did Han Solo (Harrison Ford) get his spaceship, the
star-spanning Millennium Falcon?
 &HT;    15. Besides the three ``Star Wars'' feature films, there was one
television movie based on the series. What was it?
 &HT;    16. Who played Darth Vader in all three ``Star Wars'' movies?
 &HT;    17. Where did Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) first meet Han Solo?
 &HT;    18. What does Yoda tell Luke he must do in order to become a
true Jedi knight?
 &HT;    19. Only one actor in the original ``Star Wars'' films won an
Oscar, before or since. Who?
 &HT;    20. Where on earth would you go to find a place that looked like
Tatooine? 
 -0- 
 THE STAR-TLING ANSWERS  
 &HT;    1. HAL renders ``Daisy,'' with its all-too-true chorus, ``I'm
half crazy ... ''
 &HT;    2. Flash Gordon dueled the interplanetary tyrant Ming the
Merciless.
 &HT;    3. ``Alien'' reminded us that sound doesn't travel through outer
space _ but took place mostly aboard a starship, where an
artificial atmosphere made possible ample screaming.
 &HT;    4. Arrakis is the source of a rare spice, melange.
 &HT;    5. The Martian invaders in this H.G. Wells adaptation are immune
to earthly guns, bombs and even atomic weapons _ but not to human
germs, which wipe them out.
 &HT;    6. Klaatu gets his audience's attention by causing a 30-minute
power failure _ worldwide.
 &HT;    7. The Blob is finally trapped in a diner. In the 1988 remake,
incidentally, it's a skating rink.
 &HT;    8. Elliott made friends with the lost E.T. by plying him with
Reese's Pieces candy.
 &HT;    9. ``Them'' are radiation-mutated giant ants.
 &HT;    10. It took the combined efforts of Browning and Chapman to
embody ``The Creature From the Black Lagoon'' (1954).
 &HT;    11. Triffids are carnivorous plants _ think immense venus
flytraps. Unlike flytraps, however, triffids can move from place to
place.
 &HT;    12. Most sci-fi radiation seems to make small things huge, but
Grant Williams' character encounters a cloud of radioactive mist
and finds himself incredibly shrinking.
 &HT;    13. Tatooine is located in a binary system, with two suns.
 &HT;    14. Solo won the Falcon in a bet with Lando Calrissian (Billy
Dee Williams), the raffish governor of Cloud City, as revealed in
``The Empire Strikes Back.''
 &HT;    15. ``The Ewok Adventure'' aired in 1984 on ABC, and focused on
the furry, tree-dwelling creatures who first appeared in ``Return
of the Jedi.''
 &HT;    16. It's a trick question: While James Earl Jones supplied the
voice, the man in the Sith Lord's costume was actor David Prowse.
Actor Sebastian Shaw was the face of Darth Vader, but appeared only
in ``Return of the Jedi.''
 &HT;    17. Luke first meets Solo in a cantina on Tatooine _ think a
waterfront bar frequented by some seriously weird sailors.
 &HT;    18. To become a Jedi knight, Luke must confront Darth Vader _
enough reason for the average student to drop out.
 &HT;    19. Alec ``Obi-Wan Kenobi'' Guinness won the Best Actor Oscar
for ``The Bridge on the River Kwai'' (1957).
 &HT;    20. ``Star Wars'' _ and the new ``Phantom Menace'' _ were filmed
in part in the north African nation of Tunisia.

THE LEGEND IN WINTER: ROD STEIGER ON MOVIES, HOLLYWOOD AND
ELIZABETH TAYLOR 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of Rod Steiger in a scene from ``Crazy in
Alabama.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    One of Hollywood's longest-running feuds is over.
 &HT;    For 45 years Rod Steiger hated Marlon Brando's guts, and that's
the way he liked it.
 &HT;    It all stemmed from one of the most famous movie scenes of all
time, the ``I coulda been a contender'' scene in ``On the
Waterfront'' (1954).
 &HT;    ``You know that taxi scene in `On the Waterfront?''' Steiger
says. ``Well, Marlon wasn't there when I did my close-ups. And
because acting is reacting, I never got over it.''
 &HT;    But last year Steiger was in Montreal to receive a
lifetime-achievement award and received a ``wonderful telegram''
from ... Brando.
 &HT;    After his speech, Steiger was handed a note with an invitation
and directions to a small Chinese restaurant on the outskirts of
town.
 &HT;    ``And who is sitting there at a table but Mr. Brando,'' Steiger
recalls. ``I said to myself, `I guess you've got to go over there
and thank him for his damn telegram.'
 &HT;    ``So I walked up to the table and said, `Marlon!''' he says.
``We gave big hugs, and I rubbed his bald head against my bald
head.
 &HT;    ``And then I said, `I'm really sorry you sent me the telegram,
because now I can't say any more rotten things about you!'''
 &HT;    Steiger laughs. It's a sparkling spring day in Los Angeles, and
the actor is sitting on his back patio, overlooking the Pacific
Ocean.
 &HT;    If the man notorious as the most ornery guy in Hollywood seems
uncharacteristically mellow, it's no wonder. He's happy to be here
today, working and alive, after an eight-year bout with crippling
clinical depression that rendered him all but bedridden.
 &HT;    ``I was sick for eight years,'' he says, ``and I never thought I
would make it back ... I just didn't care anymore.''
 &HT;    Five years ago, and with the aid of new medication, he began to
feel better.
 &HT;    ``There wasn't a major turning point where you think, `I've got
this thing licked,''' he says. ``You come back as gradually as you
left. I just found that one day I was more interested in life.
 &HT;    ``One of the first things that dies in a clinical depression is
your curiosity,'' he adds. ``I'm talking about everything from
watching how an ant crawls across a piece of wood to greater and
more important things. I finally got my curiosity back.''
 &HT;    Which was all well and good, but a far cry from acting in major
motion pictures.
 &HT;    ``I wondered if I could still act,'' Steiger admits. ``It was
like starting all over again for me. I worried that I wouldn't be
able to remember a line.''
 &HT;    For the Oscar-winning actor, veteran of such film classics as
``On the Waterfront,'' ``Oklahoma'' (1956), ``The Pawnbroker''
(1965) and ``Dr. Zhivago'' (1965), the stakes were high. There was
nothing he could take for granted, including the response of a new
Hollywood generation which had mostly forgotten him or assumed him
dead.
 &HT;    ``The only thing that saved me is that I did pretty good work in
the past and my movies were on television,'' the actor says. ``The
younger people began to say, `Hey, he's pretty good. Who is
that?'''
 &HT;    The result is a revived career that in recent months has
included work on the upcoming Arnold Schwarzenegger action film
``End of Days,'' as well as roles in Antonio Banderas' directorial
debut ``Crazy in Alabama'' and in ``Lazarus and the Hurricane,''
Denzel Washington's biopic of controversial boxer Rubin
``Hurricane'' Carter.
 &HT;    He's also completed a straight-to-video sequel to his 1997 film
``Shiloh,'' and even signed to direct his first movie,
``Thanksgiving.''
 &HT;    Not bad for a 74-year-old.
 &HT;    ``I have two cars,'' he explains. ``My license plate on one car
says `Courage,' and the other car says `Keep Moving.' And that's
what you've got to do. You've got to get out of the bed. You've got
to force yourself at any age.''
 &HT;    ``End of Days'' casts Steiger as a priest _ ``the nice guy for
once,'' he says _ facing a visit by Satan to New York at the turn
of the millennium.
 &HT;    He didn't have to research the role of a priest, the actor adds,
or delve into Satanism.
 &HT;    ``I hate to bring it up,'' he says, ``but I did do a terrible
movie called `The Amityville Horror'' (1979), where I did the most
difficult scene in my entire life. I had to sit still while they
poured beer and sugar on me. And then they unleashed all these
flies. Because, you know, when the devil comes, I guess flies are
supposed to arrive, too.
 &HT;    ``I could only hold the scene for a minute,'' he adds. ``The
tickling drove me nuts.''
 &HT;    ``Thanksgiving'' is a different kind of ticklish project _ a
low-budget drama about three aging gay men who have differing
Thanksgiving dinners.
 &HT;    ``It's rather funny,'' Steiger says, ``but it's not campy. But
then it gets to be tragic.''
 &HT;    He'd hoped for a cast that would include himself, James Garner
and Sidney Poitier, his co-star in his Oscar-winning ``In the Heat
of the Night'' (1967).
 &HT;    ``But Jimmy is busy,'' he says, frowning. ``Sidney is an
ambassador to something, so forget it.''
 &HT;    In other words, casting gay roles isn't easy, which came as no
surprise to Steiger.
 &HT;    ``I remember when I did `The Sergeant' (1968) many years ago,
about a master sergeant in the army who falls in love with this new
young guy he has working in the office,'' he recalls. ``I heard,
`You better be careful, Rod. Oh my God! You won't work again.' And
I yelled back, `I know what goes on in my bedroom, my friend. I'm
not worried about it.'''
 &HT;    The ornery Steiger of old resurfaced earlier this year, when it
was announced that Elia Kazan, his director for ``On the
Waterfront'' and a former friendly witness before the House
Un-American Activities Committee, would receive an honorary Oscar.
 &HT;    ``I didn't think he should get anything,'' Steiger snorts. ``If
I killed somebody when I was 13, when I was 93 I still killed them.
He killed careers.
 &HT;    ``I knew people during that time who didn't survive,'' the actor
adds angrily. ``Kazan hurt people to the point where people's
children couldn't go to school or college. No way did he deserve an
award.
 &HT;    ``He sacrificed other people's happiness for his ambitions.''
 &HT;    It isn't Kazan's name that most often turns up linked with
Steiger's in the news, of course. That would be Elizabeth Taylor,
the actress he insists is just a ``good friend.''
 &HT;    ``They've tried to make us a romance for years,'' he says. ``As
I said to somebody, `If you can have a romance with a woman in a
brace from her breasts to her hips, tell me how you did it.'''
 &HT;    Well, but Taylor isn't wearing the brace anymore.
 &HT;    ``Liz is getting better and better,'' Steiger concedes, ``but
that still doesn't mean we're having a romance. I've had four
marriages, thank you very much. My romantic days are over. I am now
a clinical advisor on love.''
 &HT;    Or is he?
 &HT;    ``I'm not really giving up,'' he says, chuckling. ``I mean, how
can you write off love when you're as physically attractive as I
am?
 &HT;    ``I'm more attractive than Liz,'' he adds with a laugh. ``When
we go out for lunch, I get all the attention.''

object _ its ratings are actually down this season.
</P>
<P>
   A better guess would be ``JAG.'' The saga of Harmon ``Harm''
Rabb Jr. (David James Elliott) and Sarah ``Mac'' MacKenzie
(Catherine Bell), Marine attorneys in the Judge Advocate General
Corps, is in its fourth season and is only growing in popularity.
And, yes, it usually tops Mulder and Scully.
</P>
<P>
   Like the ``X-Files'' couple, Mac and Harm find themselves in a
position where they can look but not touch. Making the situation
all the more difficult is the fact that Mac resembles a girlfriend
of Harm's who was murdered.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bell played that role in a first-season episode, and
only joined the cast full-time in the series' second season. The
key was an impassioned letter she wrote to creator/executive
producer Donald Bellisario, insisting how good a fit she would be
for the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have that letter in my head in case I ever need it again,''
Bell says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   In stark contrast to Mulder and Scully, who are all but disabled
by neuroses, Harm and Mac wouldn't make a bad couple. But don't
expect a clinch anytime soon, Elliott warns.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be the kiss of death,'' he says. ``We've had
discussions about it. There was one scene where the writers wanted
to exploit that, and Catherine and I went for it. It ended up being
a little too much. They had to tone it down, and we reshot the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why, but any show that has done it, it's a signal
of the end,'' he adds. ``I guess there's nothing for people to look
forward to after that _ there's no conflict, no dynamic. Until that
happens, they can say, `Oh, wow, look what almost happened.'''
</P>
<P>
   In its early years, critics more or less ignored ``JAG,'' even
though creator Bellisario had been responsible for the wildly
successful ``Magnum: P.I.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to have the Hollywood liberal press against it,''
Elliott says. ``People perceived it as a little too patriotic.
There were a lot of obstacles from the beginning. People thought of
it as a military show, and some don't like military shows. It's a
regular drama with a military backdrop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our show is old-fashioned in a good sense, like TV used to
be,'' Bell adds. ``You think a little, you're entertained, there's
a nice, happy ending and good morals. It's not so edgy and
questioning of authority. It's just good people after good
ideals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are starting to notice that it's not a jingoistic
military drama,'' Elliott says. ``We're not anti-government _
there's good and bad everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military likes the show,'' the actor adds. ``They've
gotten over the fact that we're not making training films, and they
let us shoot on bases and aircraft carriers. That kind of
production value you can't rent anywhere. It'd be insane to assault
the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the show isn't afraid to take on difficult issues, and
the government isn't always the good guy. Critics are slowly coming
around and appreciating the show's political shades of gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``They try to show both sides of political debates,'' Bell says.
``The bottom line is, the good guy always wins. Whether the guy we
choose is in fact the good guy is sometimes up to debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott admits he bristles when given speeches he disagrees
with. When that happens, he adds, he doesn't hesitate to stand in
Harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say something,'' he says. ``They once had my character
stand up for something. I felt strongly about it, and I said, `I'm
not going to say it _ it would be ridiculous to take this stance.
So they gave the lines to another character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a political animal,'' he adds. ``This show is not a
soapbox for David James Elliott. But I have to remain true to the
character.''
</P>
<P>
   Another, more obvious way the series has won a larger audience
is by jacking up the action sequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do all my own stunts,'' Elliott says, ``and I've wound up
with more bruises _ I'm banged, punched, kicked, you name it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I much prefer to fight a stunt man than another actor,'' he
adds, ``because actors get their adrenaline going when they start
fighting _ they're really trying to sell the fight to the camera.
That's usually when you wind up getting hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``A professional's not going to hit you _ he's more concerned
with hiding his face.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott admits that an action show can get tedious after a
while, but adds that ``JAG'' isn't purely an action show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neat thing is, this is not one specific genre,'' he says.
``Every week, it's not another homicide investigation. One week
it's an action show, one week it's comedy _ we've done romance,
mystery, drama. That keeps it interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   When the shift toward action was announced, Bell says, she
insisted that she wanted to be in there mixing it up with the big
boys. She says she's gotten her wish.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have given me more _ more action, more dramatic stuff and
a little bit of humor,'' she says. ``It's been fun this season. The
only thing I'm not happy about is that Mac's been in uniform all
season, and I'm hoping to get her out of uniform. But we've been on
a sub or ship a lot this season, being very military.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of uniform as in wearing other clothes, that is, not without
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Mac to just break out of the military thing,'' Bell
says, smiling. ``I'd like to see Mac's wild side, what she's like
outside of JAG. I'd like to let her hair down and let her go a
little crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe she goes dancing _ maybe she takes salsa classes and has
this wild secret life.''
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, maybe she and Scully are in the same dance
class.
</P>

AMERICAN INDIANS WIN SMALL VICTORY AT DEVILS TOWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American Indians won another court battle over their right to
worship without interference at Devils Tower National Monument in
the northeast corner of Wyoming. Unfortunately, the victory at the
10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver wasn't along constitutional
lines, which would have provided greater leverage for tribal
worship at other sacred sites located on public lands.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 Plains Indian tribes consider the 600-foot butte,
Devils Tower, a sacred site. Archaeological evidence shows that the
ancestors of the Lakota Tribes lived in the area a thousand years
ago. The site has also been a significant part of the religious and
cultural beliefs of the Sioux and other Northern Plains Indians.
Tribes travel to the tower to perform the Sun Dance and vision
quests during the month of June, around the time of the summer
solstice.
</P>
<P>
   The monument is also a premiere crack climbing site.
Approximately 6,000 climbers attempt to scale the tower each year
using the 220 routes to the top. Chas Cartwright, who has been the
superintendent of the national monument since March 1997, says that
prior to 1994, approximately 1,200 to 1,400 climbers visited during
the month of June.
</P>
<P>
   Climbers sometimes must replace metal bolts and metal pitons in
the rock face of the tower for their own safety. And the climbing
requires them to yell advice to their climbing partners. Obviously,
such activities interfere with the solitude and solemnity required
for tribal religious ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   That's the clash: climbing vs. praying. The National Park
Service brought diverse groups together, including climbers and
American Indians, to work out a plan that might satisfy the needs
of both groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Final Climbing Management Plan for Devils Tower National
Monument requests that climbers voluntarily refrain from climbing
during the month of June. Cartwright says that since the plan was
implemented in 1994, the number of climbers in June has dropped to
approximately 200.
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't been clear sailing. A few disgruntled commercial
climbers, Andy Petefish, Kenneth Anderson, Gregory Hauber and Wes
Bush, challenged the management plan. They were joined in the
lawsuit by the Bear Lodge Multiple Use Association. The Mountain
States Legal Foundation in Denver represents them. It should be
noted that the commercial climbers who brought the lawsuit continue
to climb the tower during the month of June.
</P>
<P>
   The climbers and the association lost at the federal district
level. The district court found that since the climbing plan was
modified to make the June climbing ban voluntary, the plan is
constitutional and within the Department of Interior's discretion.
</P>
<P>
   William Perry Pendley, president and chief legal advisor of the
legal foundation, in oral argument before the circuit court of
appeals, took the position that the climbing management plan
unconstitutionally promotes religion _ in this case, various
American Indian religious beliefs. Pendley argued that the plan
violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment by
pressuring climbers to stop climbing in June in order that tribal
people may worship peacefully at the tower.
</P>
<P>
   Pendley neglected to point out, as the appellate court did, that
a number of laws ``allow ... temporary closure of specific tribal
sacred sites located on federal lands.'' The appellate court's
decision lists two such sites in a footnote: El Malpais Monument
and the Cibola Historical Park, both in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian Law Resource Center in Washington, D.C., as an
intervenor representing the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and four
prominent Indian spiritual leaders, also pointed out to the court
that the National Park Service owns Christian churches and
religious properties and has a long tradition of allowing groups
``to conduct religious services on these properties, and it
prohibits recreational or other activities that would conflict with
the religious services.''
</P>
<P>
   But the appellate court did not decide the question as to
whether accommodating American Indian religious ceremonies at
Devils Tower violates the Constitution. The court never reached
that question. It decided the case on much simpler grounds: Did
those who brought the lawsuit have standing to do so? No, said the
unanimous court.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has outlined three conditions necessary
to establish standing in a court of law: 1) The plaintiff must have
suffered a concrete and specific injury because of an intrusion on
legally protected interests; 2) there must be a causal connection
between the injury and the conduct that brought the complaint; and
3) it must be likely that the injury will be redressed by a
decision favorable to the plaintiff.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs in this case failed to prove they suffered any
injury.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial climbers continue to climb in June, the members
of the Bear Lodge Multiple Use Association who do not climb in June
could if they wished. The court singled out Andy Petefish and
stated in its decision that he ``did not substantiate his claim of
economic injury as a result of the voluntary closure, and he has
provided no additional substantiation here.'' The court pointed out
that ``standing is not measured by the intensity of the litigant's
interest or the fervor of his advocacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Pendley said in an interview Friday that he intends to file a
request for a hearing before the entire 10th Circuit Court of
Appeals. He noted that such en banc hearings are rarely approved,
but he feels that the court did not apply the law correctly in
regard to Establishment Clause precedence. Pendley contends that
the so-called voluntary ban creates injury to the parties because
it violates their constitutional right not to be coerced to
accommodate a religion by a government agency.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Gunn, of Volunteer Lawyers in Boston who represented the
Indian Law Resource Center, said that he would be surprised if the
circuit court accepted Pendley's request. The court's ruling on
standing was straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright said that his staff would do an internal review of
the climbing management plan in late summer or fall, after they see
how the voluntary climbing ban works this June. He said the plan
had ``achieved a good level of success'' and that he ``plans to
stay the course.''
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court gave tribes a narrow win on this issue, but
a win, nevertheless. The court felt that once it ruled on the
plaintiffs' standing, it didn't need to address the constitutional
question. That's standard jurisprudence. If a case can be decided
on other issues, courts refrain from addressing constitutional
questions.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been a greater victory for all American Indians
had the court decided that the management plan did not violate the
Establishment Clause. Had the court done so, the positive
ramifications for tribal religious ceremonies would have reached
across the nation. Thus, this victory is bittersweet.
</P>

   Last week, this column addressed the harassment of freelance
journalist Peter Sussman. The California attorney general's office
had subpoenaed 10 years of writings, records and documents that
Sussman had created while reporting on the California prison system
and the restrictions it has put on news media access to inmates. He
was subpoenaed as a result of being listed as a possible witness in
an inmate's case against the warden of a California prison.
</P>
<P>
   Sussman had been ordered to appear in court on April 29 for a
hearing on releasing his records. The hearing never occurred. New
Attorney General Bill Lockyer, an advocate of the First Amendment,
ordered negotiations to reach a reasonable settlement and quashed
the subpoena. Sussman agreed to the settlement.

SAN FRANCISCO GIRDS FOR 2000 CELEBRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco has launched a massive planning
effort to prepare for tens of thousands of people expected to
celebrate here as the clock strikes 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The city has begun special training, is plotting sites for
emergency medical centers and expects employees from the police to
street sweepers to work overtime for the New Year's Eve
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're planning for the worst, but hoping for the best,'' said
police Sgt. Daniel Linehan, who is helping to organize the
preparations.
</P>
<P>
   Linehan and others dug into the archives to look at what
happened when San Francisco became the center of celebration on the
West Coast at the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   With the benefit of that hindsight, city officials are
intensifying their New Year's Eve planning.
</P>
<P>
   A spontaneous three-day, street fete to mark the end of the war
in 1945 left 11 celebrants dead, thousands injured, streetcars
overturned and much of the downtown in shambles. Some 3,000
soldiers were called in to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities are hoping for less chaos as revelers greet the
new year, and hope that planning will achieve their goal.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known how many people will show up. When the Golden
Gate Bridge turned 50 in 1987, organizers of the official birthday
party expected 50,000 people to walk across the span _ an estimate
that turned out to be a major miscalculation. At least 10 times
that many people showed up, giving the bridge the test of its life
and a noticeable, albeit temporary, sag in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the authorities estimate an extra 750,000 people will
be in town on Dec. 31, doubling the population.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a major event,'' said Lucien Canton, the
director of the Mayor's Office of Emergency Services.
</P>
<P>
   The city's 15,000-plus hotel rooms are being booked at a good
clip already, with eight months left until the holiday. Many hotels
are requiring a three-night minimum stay.
</P>
<P>
   Kandace Bender, a spokeswoman for Mayor Willie Brown, promised
that ``San Francisco will have a world-class celebration at the
turn of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   The city also is preparing for potential problems relating to
the year 2000 computer glitch that could affect older computers and
software that only read the last to digits in dates.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities say there is a chance the computer glitch could
disrupt traffic signals, automated fire truck ladders, elevators,
sprinklers, bank machines, data processing systems and air traffic
control.

`DASH' DIET MAY COMBAT HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In 1989, David Kidd had a heart attack. His blood
pressure was higher than normal and so was his cholesterol level.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his recovery program, he heard about the benefits of
diet and exercise. ``I became an instant believer,'' said Kidd, a
retired school superintendent living in Niskayuna, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Today, after making some diet and exercise changes, his blood
pressure is an optimal 110 over 65 and his cholesterol is 157. ``I
just do it to stay alive and feel good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that a healthy diet is important for good health.
New research, however, is showing that diet can play a direct role
in lowering blood pressure and the risk for hypertension, a major
risk for heart disease and stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that 50 million Americans suffer from high blood
pressure, those findings have the potential to address one of the
nation's most serious health problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``High blood pressure is frequently referred to as the silent
killer,'' said Janis Swain, a researcher and registered dietitian
at Brigham &AMP; Women's Hospital in Boston and a co-investigator on
the study, known as DASH or ``Dietary Alternatives to Stop
Hypertension.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, researchers had tested various single nutrients,
such as calcium, magnesium and potassium, to find clues about what
affects blood pressure, which measures the force of blood against
artery walls.
</P>
<P>
   Recorded as two numbers, the top digit represents the force of
blood when the heart contracts. The bottom one represents the force
of blood in between heart beats.
</P>
<P>
   A normal blood pressure is considered less than 130 over 85.
</P>
<P>
   When blood pressure is too high, the heart is working harder
than it should. Although no one knows exactly what causes high
blood pressure, left untreated it can lead to heart and kidney
disease and stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are medications to treat high blood pressure,
scientists supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute in Maryland tested nutrients as they occur in food to see
if they could affect blood pressure. The results were dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Among those 459 adults with higher than normal blood pressure,
the DASH eating plan lowered blood pressure. For hypertensive
patients, the reduction was even higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's your typical low-fat, no-added-salt diet,'' said Sheila
Musco, the cardiac rehabilitation coordinator at Ellis Hospital in
Schenectady, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Yet DASH is also different in some specific ways, with a
high-fiber regimen that almost doubles the usual number of
recommended fruit and vegetable servings. It is also high in low or
no-fat dairy products rich in calcium, including skim milk and
yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an eating pattern,'' Swain said. ``It's not one
particular food. There's no magic bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when many Americans are buying into gimmicky diets,
that's good news for dietitians who are trying to promote the idea
that good food is fundamental to good health.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence is out there,'' said Joyce Bagyi, a clinical
dietitian at the Albany Medical Center in Albany, N.Y. ``What you
eat can change your medical course of disease.''
</P>
<P>
   A word of caution: if you are already being treated for high
blood pressure, don't stop taking your medication. Consult your
physician about what diet changes may be right for you.

</P>
<P>
   Kidd, who is in his 70s, has come up with his own healthy eating
and exercise plan over the past decade with help from Ellis
Hospital and its specialists. ``What you don't eat is probably as
important as what you do eat,'' said Kidd, who stays away from
butter, red meat and sweets.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd has no doubt the investment in eating right has paid off.
He has plenty of energy to volunteer, play golf, exercise and keep
up with the yard work. ``It was an easy decision to make,'' he
said.

CHOOSING A LASER EYE SURGEON TAKES 20/20 FORESIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By CAROL BIDWELL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Four eyes. The class geek. The nerd behind
Coke-bottle lenses.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Williams, 31, of Hollywood has felt that way since the third
grade _ when he got his first pair of glasses.
</P>
<P>
   In college, he tried to chuck that poor self image by trading
his glasses for contact lenses. But they were such a bother.
</P>
<P>
   So five years ago, when Williams first heard about laser eye
surgery, he began doing research in hopes of tossing his thick
specs for good.
</P>
<P>
   Follow Williams' lead, say medical experts. If you're tempted to
try new eye-surgery procedures, do your homework first, because it
can be a scary and dangerous proposition to pick just any surgeon
to operate on your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Too busy to do the research? The Better Business Bureau and the
American Academy of Ophthalmologists will eliminate that excuse.
</P>
<P>
   The BBB recruited Dr. Peter McDonnell, medical director of the
USC/Doheny Refractive Laser Medical Center in Los Angeles and one
of the top ophthalmological surgeons in the United States, to help
make a video explaining refractive eye surgery and telling
potential patients what they need to know before having the
procedure done.
</P>
<P>
   The tape should be available in most libraries by late May or
early June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Refractive surgery by laser is a huge emerging market, and we
decided that, to prevent any problems, we needed to change people
from just being patients to being good consumers,'' said Donald
Burkholder, head of BBB Video Productions. The organization has
produced how-to videos on a number of subjects, from how to buy a
recreational vehicle to how to choose a mechanic to work on your
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that a lot of people feel like they're insulting
doctors by asking them questions,'' Burkholder said. ``They have
the God complex: `Whatever the doctor says, I'll do.'''
</P>
<P>
   But McDonnell says patients who question a doctor about anything
_ from the price of a procedure to his training to his equipment to
his success rate _ should get fast, straight answers. If not, he
said, they should find another doctor _ especially when considering
a delicate operation on their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't leave a car for someone to fix unless you thought
the guy you left it with knew what he was doing,'' McDonnell said.
``And I think your eyes are certainly more important than your
car.''
</P>
<P>
   Choosing a surgeon wasn't something Williams wanted to do on a
whim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to find the right doctor,'' Williams said. ``I wasn't
going to have somebody slice open my eyes without checking him
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Satisfied with the track record of the USC/Doheny center, which
does 300 to 400 of the surgeries per month, Williams chose Dr.
William May, the institute's president, to do the procedure he
hoped would change his life.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure he used is called LASIK (laser assisted in situ
keratomileusis) surgery, where an instrument called a microkeratome
is used to cut a thin flap on the cornea's surface so a laser can
reshape the cornea.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery would be bloodless, because there are no blood
vessels in the cornea, and painless, although he'd feel pressure
from several instruments, May told him. Williams knew there were no
guarantees, no way to assure he'd have perfect vision after the
surgery. He might still have to wear reading glasses, and he was
told the surgery might have to be repeated as his eyes change with
age. But he was assured that his eyesight _ so poor without that he
could only see clearly less than 6 inches without his glasses _
would improve drastically.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Williams stretched out in a tiny operating room,
ready for surgery at last. After anesthetizing Williams' eyes with
drops, May cut two tiny flaps from the surface of each eyeball,
then the rat-tat-tat sound of the laser filled the room as a
pinpoint beam of light reshaped Williams' corneas.
</P>
<P>
   Forty seconds for the right eye; 40 seconds for the left eye.
</P>
<P>
   Then the flaps were smoothed back into place.
</P>
<P>
   Within five minutes, Williams was reading the tiny letters on an
eye chart _ without glasses. His vision was a little blurry, but
improving by the minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations!'' May told him. ``You've just seen well
enough to pass the California driver's license test. And your
vision will only get better for the next two weeks or so.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Awesome!'' was all an emotionally exhausted Williams could
say. ``Awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   The result of all his homework was finally paying off. Over the
years, Williams had checked out a variety of doctors and hospitals,
read a virtual library of articles about the surgery and picked one
of the most respected hospitals in the country to do the procedure.
(Insurance usually doesn't cover the surgery, so Williams' dad
offered to help pay the $4,400 bill _ $2,200 for each eye.)
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody who's had laser eye surgery has been as lucky as
Williams. Based on ads promising perfect vision, many have believed
fraudulent or overblown claims, made by doctors who perhaps have
not been properly trained to perform the delicate surgery.
</P>
<P>
   A few patients who've trusted the wrong doctors _ perhaps
well-meaning but using cheap lasers of doubtful accuracy _ have
gone blind after the surgery. Others have suffered infections and
corneal burns that have required cornea transplants.
</P>
<P>
   So blatant were some doctors' claims that the Federal Trade
Commission has warned eye surgeons to tone down their advertising
(``Throw away your eyeglasses'' and ``Have perfect vision'' are
almost always false claims, says the FTC), and the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration has cautioned that any lasers operated without
FDA approval, or without being part of an FDA-approved clinical
trial, will be seized.
</P>
<P>
   Especially dangerous are the unregulated, unapproved ``black
box'' lasers, purchased cheaply and imported from overseas, says
the FDA. The lasers earned the derogatory term because their
strength and precision, both untested, is a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Although the FDA can regulate the laser equipment itself, it's
up to state and national medical boards to crack down on untrained
doctors who use lasers improperly, said Michelle Stevens,
spokeswoman for the American Academy of Ophthalmologists. And
policing all those doctors is becoming a harder job, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As managed care is cutting into doctors' earnings, (laser
surgery) is a way for doctors to make more money,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The approved laser USC/Doheny and most other eye centers use
costs $550,000, but a ``black box'' laser can be purchased overseas
for $80,000, McDonnell said.
</P>
<P>
   And because there's no standard for training for the relatively
new surgery, any eye surgeon can buy a laser and start operating on
patients' eyes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospects are scary,'' McDonnell said. ``And if it doesn't
seem scary to you, I don't think you're taking this surgery
seriously. You have to be careful about self-proclaimed experts.
Some of them aren't experts at all.'' &QL;

QU ESTIONS   TO ASK ABOUT   EYE SURGERY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Farsighted? Nearsighted? Have an astigmatism?
</P>
<P>
   You may be a candidate for laser eye surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But before stepping into the operating room, a wise patient who
is also a good consumer should ask a prospective surgeon several
questions, said Dr. Peter McDonnell, medical director for
USC/Doheny Refractive Laser Medical Center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do I find a surgeon?
</P>
<P>
   Ask friends who have had the surgery; ask your family doctor;
call the local medical society. Or check out the American Academy
of Ophthalmology, at Q: www.eyenet.org, for a list of surgeons in
your area. Call the Better Business Bureau at (818) 386-5510 to
find out about a doctor's business history. Call the American Board
of Ophthalmology's Board Certification Line at (800) 776-2378, or
check out its Web site at www.certifieddoctor.org to see if he or
she is board-certified.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What should I ask a doctor before agreeing to surgery?
</P>
<P>
   Get an eye exam and ask how much your vision would be corrected
by surgery. Ask whether you would still have to wear glasses after
surgery. Ask him to describe the surgery and any side effects. Ask
about fees.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What should I know about the doctor's equipment and training?
</P>
<P>
   Ask if his laser is FDA approved (it should be), how many
similar surgeries he has done, what sort of training he has, and
whether he participates in ongoing training. Ask what his success
rate is (a good success rate would include vastly improved vision
in virtually all patients, no cases of blindness and virtually no
cases of infection) and how he calculates that success rate. Ask
whether he will be performing the surgery and, if not, who will be.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about after surgery?
</P>
<P>
   Ask whether there will be follow-up exams and when, what
treatments will be given if there are complications, any medication
needed afterward, and how long the healing process takes. &QL;

FAITHS CLASH IN NAZARETH OVER LAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZARETH, Israel _ Along Paul VI Street in the center of this
town where Jesus came of age, the smashed windows in the Christian
shops were being repaired and owners of looted stores were trying
to assess their losses.
</P>
<P>
   Nazareth, a community of Christian and Muslim Arabs packed
together on a steep hillside, has long prided itself on tolerance.
But now, in the aftermath of several days of rioting that erupted
on Orthodox Easter Sunday between members of the two faiths, the
city is struggling to come to terms with the violence.
</P>
<P>
   As it senses itself fraying along religious lines, this
once-cohesive community of 65,000 has begun to fear the future.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the shattered glass and toppled shelves of his shoe store,
Raed Hakim, 29, a Christian, asked, ``How did this happen? How
could people who used to live together with us do this?''
</P>
<P>
   The backdrop to the violence is a simmering two-year dispute
over a half-acre plot of land. The Christian mayor wants to build a
public plaza at the foot of the massive Church of the Annunciation
as part of a ``Nazareth 2000'' project. Leaders of the militant
Islamic Movement, who control the municipal council, say the
proposed project would violate an Islamic shrine, and they want to
build a mosque on the site, with a towering minaret capped by a
laser-lit Muslim crescent.
</P>
<P>
   As the tension built in recent months, Israeli government
officials did little to intervene. Witnesses said Israeli police
stood and watched when violence erupted. Compared with past
episodes involving Arab Muslims in violent land disputes, the
police passivity was unusual.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli reluctance to get involved has the Christian mayor
and Israeli journalists questioning whether forces in Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party are siding with Muslims
in a cynical ploy to pick up Arab votes in this month's election,
playing a political game that exploded in violence less than one
month before what is expected to be a very close vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an old game of divide and rule, but it has become a
dangerous game,'' said Nazareth Mayor Ramez Jeraisi, a member of an
old-line Communist party and a Christian. ``Likud sided with
Muslims here to get their votes. And now look what has happened.
I'm afraid the damage to our community, the way we get along, will
be long term.''
</P>
<P>
   The Netanyahu government dismisses any notion that it was
stirring trouble to win Arab votes as ``conspiracy theories.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the claims and denials, there is no mistaking the
destruction caused by the volatile mix of politics and religion. It
has left Nazareth fretting over its international reputation on the
eve of the millennium, when millions of Christian tourists are
expected to flock to the Holy Land and the pope is expected to make
a historic visit.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon traveled to the Vatican
last week to meet Pope John Paul II about his visit, and reportedly
discussed the simmering tensions in Nazareth. Eager to find a
compromise, the Israeli government has offered to allow the Muslims
to build a small mosque. The Vatican has criticized the Muslim
plans as ``a provocation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is politics and religion colliding,'' said Nahum Barnea,
a reporter for the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot. ``It started
as petty politics, but now people are worried it has spun out of
control.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble began in late 1996, when the Christian mayor
proposed building a public plaza at the foot of the Church of the
Annunciation, where Christians believe the Angel Gabriel appeared
to the Virgin Mary to announce she was going to bear a son, Jesus.
The plaza was part of an $80 million project of city improvements
geared toward handling the wave of tourists in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But a militant group of Muslim activists saw the municipal plan
as a holy war against their faith. The land once housed a school
dating to 19th century Ottoman rule, which Muslims say housed a
small mosque. The city tore it down in November 1997 to build the
plaza.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner of the lot still stands a small shrine to Shahab
el Din, a martyr in an 11th-century battle against Christian
crusaders.
</P>
<P>
   Barnea, the journalist, has written extensively on the tensions
in Nazareth, and said that at the onset of the dispute, a Likud
adviser on Arab affairs, Danny Greenberg, landed in Nazareth.
Greenberg, he said, promised the Islamic movement that Netanyahu's
government would not stop them from taking the land by force. In
December 1997, they did just that, descending on the vacant lot in
the dead of night. They created a makeshift mosque by erecting a
tent and loudspeakers to call prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Under Israeli land laws, the police had to remove them from the
property within 30 days or the Muslims would have a legal claim to
the lot. But the police did not act, saying the seizure took place
during Ramadan, the Muslim holy month.
</P>
<P>
   The militants have been occupying the land for more than a year
while the case lingers in court.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute gave the Islamic movement a cause and helped the
Muslim Unity Party win a 10-seat majority on the 19-seat municipal
council in November. Muslims represent a roughly 65 percent of
Nazareth's population.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, Salman Abu Ahmed, the head of the Unity
Party, dressed in a blue suit, came out from noon prayers under the
cool shade of the tent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do Christians want this specific piece of land?'' he
asked, as supporters gathered. ``This is holy land, so why should
they be entitled to build a tourist park? Build it somewhere else.
The church owns a lot of land.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Abu Ahmed had proposed that the land be used for a new
municipal building, according to the council's minutes. Asked why
he now sees it as holy land, he replied, ``I didn't know it then.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the tent, a group of several hundred Muslim worshipers
were milling around on the hot afternoon. One, Mohammed Abu Rahal,
40, shaking with anger, said, ``We will die here for this mosque.''
When the tent mosque first went up, Friday prayers drew only a few
dozen militants. Since the eruption of violence, as many as 1,500
Muslims have been attending, and hundreds have been going to daily
services.
</P>
<P>
   Barnea and Jeraisi said Likud's keen interest in the dispute
revolves around two political benefits they can derive from it.
Likud, they say, is trying to win Arab votes in what is expected to
be a very close election on May 17. Knowing that the hard-line
Likud has no natural constituency among Arabs and received only 5
percent of the Arab vote in the last election, the party has
targeted certain Arab towns to win votes by making political
promises on issues that matter to them. Picking up even 1,000 votes
out of Nazareth's 35,000 registered voters would be a considerable
gain in this election.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the two observers said, Netanyahu's Likud may have
wanted to permit the militant Muslims to rampage to show Christians
worldwide, including the Vatican, a frightening image of what would
happen to Christian holy sites if Jerusalem were divided and part
of it placed under Palestinian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Moti Zaken, Netanyahu's adviser on Arab affairs, acknowledged
that Likud's Greenberg had ``played some foolish games there'' and
was reprimanded for it.
</P>
<P>
   He made the Muslim Arabs ``think they might gain something, but
they are wrong if they think that,'' said Zaken.
</P>
<P>
   Zaken denied a Likud plot, saying, ``First of all, Muslims
wouldn't vote for Likud even if we paid them. This is good for
newspapers and conspiracy theories, but it has nothing to do with
reality.''

`I AM COMLETELY CHANGED'

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fleeing war or persecution is becoming a way of life worldwide.
Before Kosovo, the world had 22.3 million refugees _ one for every
264 people on earth; now there are 700,000 more. How have those
other refugees, from places like Ethiopia and Cambodia and Sierra
Leone, fared in their new lives? How did their uprooting experience
change them? Focus writer Matthew Brelis talked with six refugees
who landed in America. Their answers provide some insight into what
may lie ahead for hundreds of thousands of Kosovar Albanians. &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HASSAN KOROMA, 32, a senior assistant secretary in Sierra
Leone's ministry of youth and sports, fled his West African
homeland in June 1997 when a coup d'etat resulted in mass murder of
government officials. Today he does odd jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am completely changed. I have lost my self-esteem. I am very
guilty of things I never thought would affect me. I completely
regret leaving my family. At first, I thought I was very clever (to
have escaped). But my wife was shot. My children are in another
country and I cannot get to them, my extended family _ I do not
know what has happened. It has been traumatic and I feel very, very
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now . . . I try to convince immigration officials I should
have permanent refugee status and that would qualify me for a
program to help bring my kids here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just alone now, just trying to get along. Everyone I know
is dead or not seen. Rebels went to my village in the north and
killed my grandmother and my cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see Kosovo, I feel like the whole thing is happening to
me again. . . .'' &QL;

<P>
   FARAH MOHAMED, 34, fled Somalia at the end of 1986 after being
arrested several times because of his opposition to the government.
Today he is a family counselor for Catholic Charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a refugee camp for more than a year. It was quite an
experience . . . actually, most of the problems were psychological.
My biggest fear was the lack of understanding, the lack of vision
about my future, what was to become of me . . . and being worried
about family members in Somalia. It is something that stays with
me, even though I consider myself lucky when I see what is
happening to other people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to the United States in 1988 and I am a citizen now. I
think the question of going home will take time to answer. It is
really a Catch-22. I would like to go back and help my people, but
I have a different understanding about life today. I have worried
that things can go wrong so easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo is really sad. It is like it is happening to me. I
started reducing my time watching TV because I cannot really take
it. It is not only the death and dying, but actually that I know
more about being a refugee. . . . I think many people don't really
understand what being a refugee means. It is losing everything.
Some people only think about losing life. Some think that is the
biggest thing to lose. But besides your possessions, your family,
you lose your identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought about ending up in America. Everyone in my
neighborhood knew my name, what tribe I came from, and what I stood
for. Here, I am only a black guy around the block.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am relatively educated. I got a master's degree, I am a
working professional, but I cannot redefine myself, my role. I am
missing something and that is the reality of being a refugee.'' &QL;

   BELAI HABTE-YESUS, 44, left Ethiopia in 1976 to study medicine
in India. In 1985, he chose not to return home when the government
started killing students. Today he works for the Ethiopian
Community Development Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see the situation on the tube, I am reminded of what
happened in Ethiopia in 1977, people displaced internally because
of famine. I have not been sleeping in the past few nights. I feel
this will be the challenge of the 21st century: There is not enough
sympathy for the plight of simple, ordinary people who are victims
of political terror. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Going home again is a challenge; I think about it every day of
my life. It has been almost 23 years and I have not seen my family
and friends. I pray and hope that I will be able to go back one
day. I always thought it would be a temporary thing, a year or two,
at most five.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, mental-wise, I am well informed, but emotionally I am
fairly disconnected. I don't think I could say I am a complete,
full person, having gone through what I have _ and I have not seen
anything physical like torture.'' &QL;

   AIDA IBISEVIC, 16, left Bosnia-Herzogovina with her parents in
1995 because of the conflict there. Today she is a student.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard leaving everything. The material stuff is nothing,
but we had family and friends and a sense of belonging somewhere.
Here, you have to go on proving yourself _ learning a new language
and trying to fit in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has helped my confidence because I had to go through a lot
to find friends, learn a language, and fit in. I know nothing can
hurt me. All the bad things that are supposed to happen have
already happened. The war made me stronger, but changing the
environment and starting all over from the beginning helped a lot,
too. I think I became a stronger person and raised my
self-confidence up and helped me understand myself and my family.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, I feel I lost some of my identity, but this
has given me so much self-confidence. I ask myself sometimes if I
belong to any country, and I want to belong to both. I am an
American, but I have not stopped being a Bosnian. I feel like I am
losing some identity, but I am not letting it go and it is all
about what you feel like inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I wish the war never happened. I would never have
left Bosnia where we have friends and everything. I would not want
to go through it again, but I would not change it. It does not
matter as long as I feel loved, but I would not wish it to anyone
else.'' &QL;

in 1975 when the Khmer Rouge took power. After two years, she fled
to refugee camps in Thailand. Today she an administrative
assistant.

   ``We came here in 1981 and we all try to heal our souls. We go
to temple to try and get the nightmare over, and then, boom! All
these things come up. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kosovo thing is being addressed much faster than what
happened in the killing fields (of Cambodia, but) Kosovo strikes me
so hard, I feel like I am again running at gunpoint. Everyone in my
family is taking it personally, reliving old memories. All these
years later and things still happen the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I came here, make a decent life, have a good house
_ much better than in Cambodia _ nothing is the same. You still
miss the one you grew up in. Life for refugees is never the same,
even if you have much more than you had before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the Kosovars go back, it will not be the same;
everything is destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wish to go back and I plan, but I don't know if the
situation allows it, security-wise. I have been here 17 years and I
never feel settled. I still feel something is missing. You have
Christmas, but we had New Year's.'' &QL;

came to the United States in 1976.

back unless we have our own country. When my husband and I became
American citizens, I knew that was it. I was happy to become an
American.

   ``I feel I gained, I don't feel I lost my identity. I am still
Kurdish, but I found another identity. At home I am Kurdish. When I
come to work I am American. I don't feel I have lost at all. The
more you know about other cultures, you are learning. How could you
be losing?
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a refugee made me a better person, a tougher person, I
know I can take the worst situation and make it livable. It really
taught me a lot. I have learned to work harder. I have learned to
get to know other cultures, other languages and to accept all
people equally.

this. I cannot turn on the TV at dinner.''

SPEAKING OF GRILLING: LAUER DESERVES ROASTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton's former girlfriend Monica Lewinsky is being
criticized these days because she bailed out on some interview
commitments after an unfortunate encounter with Matt Lauer on NBC's
``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   The news reports and commentary about the incident mostly say
that Lewinsky couldn't handle the ``tough questions'' that were
asked during her chat with Lauer and that she canceled the
remaining interviews on her U.S. book tour because she feared the
prospect of further ``grilling'' by other TV inquisitors.
</P>
<P>
   Tough questions? Grilling? Matt Lauer?
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like one of those test questions where you're given a
grouping of words or phrases and asked to pick out the one that
doesn't fit. If Lauer ever did any grilling, it must have occurred
in the backyard and involved some hamburgers.
</P>
<P>
   Lauer was the guy throwing the softballs on that fateful day
when Hillary Rodham Clinton declared that allegations regarding her
husband's affair with Lewinsky were the product of a vast
right-wing conspiracy. He let that slide by as if he'd asked the
first lady about the weather and she had accurately reported that
the sun was shining.
</P>
<P>
   Tough questions, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Koppel probably gives the information operator a tougher
grilling when he calls for directory assistance than Lauer has ever
given a public official or celebrity in a TV interview. Lauer
doesn't specialize in tough questions _ but he does specialize in
questions that are irrelevant, rude and just plain dumb.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to Monica. The interview on ``Today''
started going downhill when Lauer demanded that Lewinsky justify
her attendance at moviedom's Academy Awards and her post-Oscar
partying way back in March.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky seemed taken aback by the question _ not because it
stumped her but because it was so stupid. She obviously wondered
what on earth her party-hopping with movie stars had to do with her
book, or even with her role in the White House sex-and-lies
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   But she answered the question competently and politely,
explaining that after everything she'd been through, she thought
she was entitled to a little fun.
</P>
<P>
   Lauer's reaction to her answer _ an answer that could have and
perhaps should have been, ``Why shouldn't I go to the Oscars, you
jerk? _ was the body-language equivalent of ``Harrumph!''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to quasi-sanctimonious pomposity, Lauer may be in
a class by himself. And he was just getting warmed up.
</P>
<P>
   Having asked Lewinsky, in effect, what gave her the right to
parlay her unfortunate notoriety into a night on the town, Lauer
next wanted to know if she had suffered a suitable amount of guilt
and self-loathing for the pain that her dalliance with the
president might have inflicted on his wife and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the question suggested that Lauer considered
Lewinsky to be primarily responsible for the marital vow-breaking
that took place in and around the Oval Office. Lauer evidently
bought Clinton's under-oath explanation of the relationship:
Lewinsky had sex with him, but he didn't have sex with her.
</P>
<P>
   Lauer then read a passage from Lewinsky's book in which she
describes in somewhat explicit detail her anticipation of an
intimate encounter with the president. Lauer followed up the
dramatic reading by asking Lewinsky how she could show such
insensitivity to Clinton's family. Why, Hillary and Chelsea could
pick up that book and read this trash, he huffed.
</P>
<P>
   The look on Lewinksy's face as Lauer read indicated _ in order _
surprise, alarm, annoyance, anger. But she didn't miss a beat,
throwing the accusation right back at him: How could he be so
irresponsible and insensitive as to read this passage on network
television, thus exposing her words to millions of viewers who
never have and never will read her book _ including, perhaps, the
president's wife and daughter?
</P>
<P>
   The media can rip Lewinsky all they want. I say she emerged from
the interview with a lot more dignity than Lauer did.
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. Is that what's known as damning with faint praise?
</P>

IF YOU NEED AN MRI, TAKE A NUMBER AND GET IN LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tried to schedule an MRI lately?
</P>
<P>
   If so, you probably had to wait two to six weeks, or were told
to come in the middle of the night. And if you were lucky enough to
land an immediate daytime date, chances are it was on Super Bowl
Sunday, Easter or some other occasion when no one in their right
mind would want to squeeze inside a donut-shaped machine with
magnets pounding in their ears.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech diagnostic devices are in such demand at hospitals
across the state that they're up and running 15 to 24 hours a day,
with considerable waits for anyone without a life-threatening
condition. That's why, even though they're one of the most
expensive machines in the hospital, many facilities are lining up
to buy more, and most are running the ones they have as often as
they can.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is a dramatic development considering that just a
dozen years ago few doctors and fewer patients knew what a magnetic
resonance imaging machine was. Over that time, and especially in
the last several years, the MRI has become the test of choice to
diagnose orthopedic injuries as well as problems in the brain and
spine. And it's increasingly being used to pinpoint potential
strokes and heart attacks, as well as to guide surgeons operating
on the liver and prostate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have patients on the phone every day asking to be moved up,
begging to have their scans done sooner rather than later,'' says
Dr. Clare Tempany, director of clinical MRI at Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston. ``It's five to seven weeks now for an elective
outpatient procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine is a great job to have because there's something new
happening with MRIs all the time. . . . The technology is
improving, the magnets are getting faster, and we're able to do
different things with them that we didn't dream about when they
first came out.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors aren't the only ones turned on by all the new things
MRIs can do. ``They saved my life, definitely,'' says Thomas
McArdle, a retired electrician who has had six of them in recent
years, including one last month at Brigham that found an aneurysm
in his aortic artery and another in March that helped doctors there
insert radioactive seeds in just the right place to attack his
prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have come quite a way in just the quality of the
picture,'' he says, adding that it more than makes up for the fact
that it now takes weeks to schedule a test.
</P>
<P>
   To understand all the hoopla about MRIs, it helps to understand
what the machines do, and how they have been transformed since they
first started showing up in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   MRIs contain powerful magnets that make the positive-charged
proton particles in the body line up in the same direction. Radio
waves are then transmitted towards the protons, which absorb the
energy, tilt and, as the waves are switched off, emit a signal that
the MRI measures and transposes into a picture.
</P>
<P>
   Those pictures used to be fairly crude, but now they're getting
better and better at zeroing in on everything from soft tissue and
bone marrow to all organs of the body. And as the pictures
improved, so did the uses of the tests, moving from the brain to
the spine to the entire musculoskeletal system.
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms that means that orthopedic surgeons can, for
the first time, get a clear look at whether cartilage is missing
from the joint surface in a patient's knee without having to go in
with an arthroscope, which means the patient is less likely to end
up needing surgery or having to be on crutches. They also can
detect subtle bone fractures that are too tiny for x-rays to pick
up.
</P>
<P>
   Progress has been equally spectacular in other areas of the
anatomy, with MRIs now used to unmask and sort out lesions in the
liver, to determine how bad a ruptured disk is and to see whether
everything is going right with a pregnancy. A new type of magnetic
imaging machine also has found a place in the operating room,
giving surgeons a real-time roadmap of where they are going in
cutting tissue, attacking a tumor and performing other parts of the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the heart, ``which is going to be the real
gangbuster with MR technology,'' predicts Dr. Stephen Sweriduk,
medical director of Shields Healthcare Group of Brockton, Mass.,
whose 10 machines make it the biggest player in the Bay State's MRI
business. Tests already confirm that imaging can identify heart
troubles at a stage before they cause an attack or other damage,
and those techniques are being finetuned to provide critical data
on the walls, valves, vessels and other parts of the coronary
network.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many different ways to look at the heart right now,
from ultrasound and nuclear medicine to coronary angiography,''
says Sweriduk. ``But the newest MRI scanners are so fast they
actually freeze cardiac motion, doing what all the other tests do
combined. . . . I think this will displace the other tests; you'll
have everything done in one stop and you'll be finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that information we'll be able to decide who gets medical
therapy and who gets surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   MRIs always have been harmless to patients, which is especially
reassuring to anyone who worries about the radiation required with
x-rays and CT scans. Now the per-procedure cost for insurance
companies, which a decade ago ranged from $1,200 to $1,500, are
about a third of that, which relieves some of the concerns that
insurers have had about the proliferation of such tests. If a
doctor orders an MRI insurers typically pay the entire cost.
</P>
<P>
   Add up the lower costs and expanded uses and you have a
diagnostic device that is booming, displacing many uses of x-rays
and going head-to-head with the also-hot technology of CT scans,
which is faster and better at providing images of some body parts
but not as precise with others. What that means for hospitals is
getting the most out of the MRI machines they have and asking the
state for permission to purchase new ones, and for patients it
means a greater likelihood of using the procedure _ and having to
wait in line.
</P>
<P>
   At Massachusetts General Hospital, for instance, one MRI device
is being used 24 hours a day, seven days a week, while the others
run from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Usage is equally intense at Beth
Israel-Deaconess, which has four scanners. And at New England
Medical Center the volume of magnetic imaging tests is up 12
percent in just the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running at maximum capacity,'' says Dr. Daniel O'Leary,
the chairman of radiology at New England Medical. ``Waiting lines
are growing well beyond two weeks now, and we've put in an
application for a second machine,''
</P>
<P>
   As the technology takes off, prices of imaging machines are
coming down much the way they are for computers, although new
machines being developed for specialized uses like the ones in the
operating room can cost more than $2 million. The newer machines
also tend to be more patient-friendly, letting the person have his
head out of the machine if the area being photographed is from the
mid-chest down. Other design changes are being tried to quiet the
magnets, which sound like a pile-driver and echo in a patient's
ears.
</P>
<P>
   McArdle, the retired electrician from Scituate, says he's had so
many MRIs that he's come up with his own system for handling the
noise and claustrophobia: ``I kind of separate myself mentally from
the machine. I put myself on the golf course and play my game, and
I actually make out better in the machine than on a real golf
course.''

EXILED PRINCE SAYS MILOSEVIC IS EVIL, NATO IMMORAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The man who would be king of Yugoslavia, Crown Prince
Alexander, is a man without a country in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   He says that President Slobodan Milosevic is an evil dictator
who has systematically destroyed Yugoslavia, its economy, and the
dream of a multiethnic nation in the Balkans, making it the pariah
of Europe. He condemns unreservedly the forced expulsion of ethnic
Albanians from Kosovo, and the terror used by Milosevic's forces.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the exiled 53-year-old prince, who has visited
Yugoslavia only a handful of times since the communists abolished
the monarchy in 1945, says he believes equally strongly that NATO's
bombing is immoral, killing innocent civilians, and has only
consolidated Milosevic's grip on power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is human nature,'' he said, sitting in his office across
from Hyde Park. ``When the Germans bombed London in the Second
World War, it only brought the British people closer together and
made them rally around their leaders. Why wouldn't it affect Serbs
the same way? Most of them don't like Milosevic, but they like the
people who are bombing them even less.''
</P>
<P>
   In simultaneously opposing Milosevic and NATO's bombing, Prince
Alexander finds himself increasingly isolated among the royal
families of Europe, many of them his relatives. Fluent in six
languages, he is the great-great-grandson of Queen Victoria and the
cousin of King Juan Carlos of Spain. Queen Elizabeth II is his
godmother.
</P>
<P>
   He has a special fondness for Britain, where his parents, King
Peter II and Princess Alexandra, settled after fleeing the Nazis in
1941. According to tradition, the heir to the Karadjordje throne
must be born on Yugoslav soil. When Prince Alexander was born July
17, 1945, in Suite 212 of Claridge's Hotel in London, Prime
Minister Winston Churchill declared the hotel room Yugoslav
territory for the day to provide for a legal succession should the
infant or his father ever return to take the throne. Dirt from
Yugoslavia was sprinkled under his bed.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Alexander was educated in Scotland and England, as well
as the United States and Switzerland, and was commissioned in the
British Army in 1966. After leaving the army, the prince used his
contacts to build an advertising career, jetting between London,
New York, and Rio de Janeiro. He later worked as an insurance
broker in Chicago and New York, before settling again in London. He
serves on several corporate boards.
</P>
<P>
   It pains him to criticize his home in exile, and the United
States, for which he has a singular admiration and where his father
is buried _ in Libertyville, Ill. But he insists that the bombing
has done more harm than good and has pushed back, not sped up, the
day when there will be stability in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the West had put just a fraction of the money they have
used to drop bombs on Yugoslavia into promoting democracy and
building up the regional infrastructure, we wouldn't be where we
are today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Western allies have paid lip service to bolstering
democracy. For example, he said, it would have been simple, ``and a
lot less expensive than cruise missiles,'' to take the independent
journalists who were tossed out of jobs by the Milosevic regime and
give them the technology to launch a Serbian version of Radio Free
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people only know what Milosevic wants them to know,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also accused the Western allies of preaching democracy and
practicing something else. The Rambouillet talks in France that
sought to avoid a military confrontation over Kosovo ``were a
disaster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, the one person who needed to be there, Milosevic,
wasn't,'' he said. ``But it wasn't really a set of negotiations.
They imposed a solution. They put a gun to Milosevic's head and
said accept this or else. They did not use democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   He blames both the West and Milosevic for sidelining Ibrahim
Rugova, the moderate ethnic Albanian leader in Kosovo, saying both
sides paid too much attention to the Kosovo Liberation Army, which
he considers ``a bunch of terrorists.'' Milosevic overreacted to
the threat posed by the KLA, launching a scorched earth policy that
killed and displaced civilians; the West, meanwhile, courted the
KLA, basically disenfranchising Rugova and all moderates.
</P>
<P>
   He says Milosevic, for selfish reasons, passed up the chance to
steer Yugoslavia toward the Western model of a free-market
democracy after the Berlin Wall fell and the Soviet Union
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic used to hoard power under communism. When communism
failed, he turned to nationalism. He has used negative nationalism
and negative religion to build up his power base.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav leader has also used old-fashioned terror and
intimidation, embodied by his massive secret police, to silence or
co-opt the news media, opposition parties, intellectuals, and
dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consider that Milosevic spends $7 billion a year on his
Interior Ministry and only $1 billion on the army,'' the prince
said. ``That tells you where his priorities are and how he controls
every facet of society.''
</P>
<P>
   The prince rejects suggestions that people get the leaders they
deserve. First, he says, Milosevic and his cronies stole the last
election, which was canceled when the voting did not go the
regime's way. Beyond that, the democracy-oriented opposition could
have been stronger if the West had given it more support, instead
of spending a decade courting Milosevic. And the West has done far
too little to go after Milosevic's assets, he says.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, he says, the bombing must stop and the United
Nations must take the lead role in policing a settlement. The
prince says that restoring a constitutional monarchy to Yugoslavia,
with him ascending to the throne that his father never abdicated,
is part of the long-term solution. He said that in the two
centuries of his family's dynasty, they championed equal rights for
all ethnicities and religions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The monarchy is above politics. It is about values,'' he said,
borrowing a phrase that President Clinton and NATO general
secretary Javier Solana have used to justify the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   He says Serbian people have been demonized by the West,
portrayed as the bogeymen in a conflict that has no shortage of
victims and perpetrators. He says no sector of people has escaped
``ethnic cleansing,'' including the 800,000 Serbian refugees in
Serbia who were driven out of other parts of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest fear is that the NATO attacks have alienated Serbs
who want democracy as much as he does. In the past decade, he says,
up to 350,000 college-educated people who would have been the
backbone of a democratic Yugoslavia have emigrated. Those left
behind are embittered by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many people in Yugoslavia who aspire to be like the
19 NATO countries, with their democracies and strong markets. But
ask yourself, what would you think if the people you aspired to be
like bombed you?'' he said. ``As I said before, this is human
nature. And Serbs are human, too. Sometimes I think people in the
West forget that.''

WHAT CAUSES HEARTBURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What causes heartburn?
</P>
<P>
   SA, Mattapan, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. First things first. Your heart is not involved in heartburn.
That uncomfortable feeling is near your heart, but it's actually in
your lower esophagus, the tube that carries food from your mouth
down into your stomach. But ``Esophagus Burn'' doesn't really have
the same ring to it, does it?
</P>
<P>
   The term doctors use is ``acid reflux.'' The hydrochloric acid
produced in your stomach leaks up into the esophagus through what's
called the lower esophageal sphincter. Dr. Timothy Wang,
gastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, explains that
the lower esophageal sphincter works like tightening a rubber band
around a straw.
</P>
<P>
   Muscles tighten in a ring around the esophagus just where it
meets the stomach, relaxing to let food down into the stomach but
tightening up before the stomach acid can get up into the
esophagus.
</P>
<P>
   Hydrochloric acid is no big deal in the stomach, since the
lining is protected by a thick layer of mucous. But the esophagus
doesn't enjoy such protection. There, stomach acid irritates the
tissue in what feels like a nice fresh jalapeno pepper dissolving
in your chest. (Stomach acid, produced by parietal cells in your
stomach's lining, has a pH of 2. Straight vinegar is pH3. On the
logarithmic pH scale, that makes stomach acid ten times more acidic
than vinegar.)
</P>
<P>
   Why does the acid get up into the esophagus, where it doesn't
belong?
</P>
<P>
   Wang says that under certain conditions, that ring of lower
esophageal sphincter muscles doesn't close tightly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Acid reflux is most often caused by nothing more than eating too
much. All the extra food in the stomach pushes back up against the
sphincter and some acid leaks out. A big meal also kicks the
parietal cells into overdrive, producing more acid.
</P>
<P>
   Lying down with a full stomach contributes to acid reflux
because gravity is no longer helping pull the food down. Spicy
foods acutally don't cause acid reflux. They may be spicy hot, but
that's not the heat of heartburn. Foods that DO induce heartburn
include fats, caffeine, alcohol, and chocolate. They increase the
production of stomach acid, and thus likelihood of reflux. (Alcohol
also relaxes the sphincter muscles.)
</P>
<P>
   It is also myth that stomach acid helps us digest our food. We
apparently don't need it.
</P>
<P>
   Chewing, and enzymes, and the stomach's muscular grinding help
break the food into the slurry called ``chyme'' (pronounced kime)
that passes into the small intestine, where enzymes finish the job
of digestion. ``We think stomach acid is leftover from a time when
our predecessors ate their meals whole, and sometimes still
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Now our meals are usually dead by the time we eat them, and
forks and knives help break them into digestible-sized bits before
we even swallow them.
</P>
<P>
   While an occasional mild case of acid reflux is common, seven
million Americans suffer much worse. They have Gastro-Esophageal
Reflux Disease. GERD. You're a GERD sufferer if you are afflicted
by acid reflux once or twice a week. Wang says that while GERD
patients sometimes have unique underlying medical conditions that
contribute to their heartburn, most suffer reflux for the same
reasons many of us do. It just hits GERD sufferers harder and more
often.
</P>
<P>
   Serious GERD is more than an uncomfortable inconvenience. A
recent study in Scandinavia published in the March 18 New England
Journal of Medicine reports a seven-fold increase in esophageal
cancer among people with moderate to severe heartburn.
</P>
<P>
   Too much acid getting too far up in your esophagus can actually
get into your trachea, your breathing tube, and cause asthma-like
symptoms, coughing and voice problems. Wang says that President
Clinton is known to take a GERD medication, and that acid reflux
may contribute to his occasional hoarseness.
</P>
<P>
   What can you do? Well, the over-the-counter medications like
Tums, Rolaids, Mylanta and Maalox neutralize acid. They're for mild
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Medications that stop the secretion of acid sometimes help the
more stubborn cases. So can drugs that tighten the sphincter.
There's even heartburn surgery which tightens up the lower
esophageal sphincter.
</P>
<P>
   But the best advice of all, Wang says, is to eat more frequent,
smaller meals, not just a few big ones, and cut down on fats,
caffeine and alcohol. Just don't create the conditions that set up
acid reflux in the first place.

STARR'S ABUSE OF POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ If the case against Susan McDougal was absurd _
and it was _ then the case against Julie Hiatt Steele is sick,
bordering on sinister.
</P>
<P>
   All the cases of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr are sideshows
on their best days, but the one that starts this week in Virginia
sets a new low in the pointless pursuit of the weak and vulnerable
out of what looks more like spite than justice.
</P>
<P>
   McDougal at least was once in a position years ago that in
theory might have produced knowledge of serious crimes by big shots
in the Whitewater investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But Julie Hiatt Steele, by that stretched standard, is a nobody.
Or, more precisely, she is everybody, living proof that the
government's power can reach into any life with shattering results
and no purpose beyond, in Starr's case, pique.
</P>
<P>
   Steele's alleged crime is a stubborn refusal to confirm a key
detail or two in the infamous White House ``groping'' story of
Kathleen Willey. For this, she faces obstruction of justice and
perjury charges.
</P>
<P>
   Just for the record, Steele is the only person to have been
charged with a crime in Starr's two-year, sex-drenched inquisition
into President Clinton's private life that yielded Monica Lewinsky
and a parody of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   It was no accident that Steele's indictment was timed for the
first day of Clinton's farce of a Senate trial in January. It was a
typical Starr stunt that deserved every bit of the widespread
condemnation it received.
</P>
<P>
   The Steele case is absurd. In Willey's oft-contradicted and
contradictory tales, Steele is supposed to be what the prosecution
calls a ``contemporary corroborating witness'' _ a person to whom
Willey confided the alleged groping incident in November of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Willey also says she asked her friend to confirm their talk to a
Newsweek reporter.
</P>
<P>
   After doing so in confidence, however, Steele then recanted. She
has claimed that the chat with Willey didn't happen that way, and
that Willey asked her to lie.
</P>
<P>
   A while back, I ran into another witness _ former Willey friend
Harolyn Cardozo _ who confirmed Steele's account in two grand jury
appearances and added details about Willey's fantasy life pursuing
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   There appears to be still another, unnamed Willey friend, who
will also confirm the story. But much more importantly for the
purpose of evaluating a major criminal case, it also turns out
there are at least four more people who back Steel; moreover, five
of the six people who maintain that Willey was ``thrilled'' by
whatever it was that happend in fact or in her mind have been known
to Ken Starr all along.
</P>
<P>
   That last nugget comes courtesy of an excellent investigation of
the case from official sources that was just published by The
Nation magazine and builds on an equally stunning report in March
by Nina Totenberg of National Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   One of the people turns out to be the ubiquitous Linda Tripp.
This has been known for a long time. What is new in a media sense,
thanks to The Nation, is the details of Tripp's story. It turns out
they have always been available in the fine print of Starr's
impeachment referral to Congress, but may have been ignored because
the type in the transcripts of her grand jury testimony was
microscopic.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Tripp testified that she not only saw an
anything-but-angry Willey right after the alleged incident but
spoke with her frequently on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp tells a tale of ridiculously relentless, fantasy pursuit
of Clinton. She also said she warned the Newsweek reporter that the
Willey story was baloney, an important factoid because Tripp says
it was then that she told him there was a much better sex story,
which turned out to be Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Nation's investigation is also especially valuable for its
fresh facts about attempts by Willey to market her story for money
before it was in the press, contradicting her initial image as
reluctant truth-teller.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out this involved bigtime New York literary agents and
not only trash-for-cash tabloids, one of whom (Lynn Nesbit) says
Willey was fishing for a book deal two months before the first
Newsweek article was printed, an assertion documented by records.
</P>
<P>
   That information fits neatly with the already known efforts in
the wake of her appearance on CBS' ``60 Minutes'' to both sell a
book and sell a tale to the tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   As the Steele case begins, there are two points that make it far
more than a final flutter in the last moments of Starr's official
life.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious one is about what has been done in the government's
name to an ordinary person caught up in this mess. If there is such
a thing as abuse of a prosecutor's discretion _ especially in the
face of a mountain of evidence that fairly scremes ``bogus'' _ this
is it.
</P>
<P>
   The other involves the press. At the time of ``60 Minutes''
interview a year ago, Willey was the rage. But other than putting
her on TV and jabbering about whether she ``seems credible'' nobody
really checked facts.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all these months later, the consequences of political
scandal-mongering are clear. That's why the Willey story is is on
the back pages today, even as Julie Hiatt Steele remains in the
dock.

EATING TO LIVE LONGER CAN TAKE A LIFETIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a list of the 118 most nutritious foods. ``How many are
in your diet?'' asks Natural Health magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see. Butternut squash. Cantaloupe. Carrots. Dandelion?
</P>
<P>
   Dandelion. An important source of vitamin A. How to get more
dandelion into my diet? Maybe a little lunchtime grazing in the
park.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I figure out how to get my minimum daily requirement
of dandelion, I'm sure some researcher will have proven that it's
useless, or even dangerous. That's the way things seem to go on the
health front. Just when you think you're doing the right thing, a
study surfaces and what was good is now bad, and vice versa. These
180-degree turns are hard on those of us who plan to live forever.
Who can keep up with all this stuff?
</P>
<P>
   For years we were led to believe that eating eggs meant certain
death. Last week, a Harvard School of Public Health study revealed
that healthy people can eat up to seven eggs a week without
increasing their risk of heart attack or stroke. That's the latest
scientific finding, at least. Tomorrow, who knows?
</P>
<P>
   Eggs are among Natural Health magazine's 118 most nutritious
foods, a good source of vitamin D, vitamin B-12, riboflavin, and
pantothenic acid. Personally, I plan to eat as many eggs as
possible before the Harvard School of Public Health changes its
institutional mind and decides eggs should be outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   To counteract cholesterol overload, I'll wash down the eggs with
plenty of red wine. Another study released last week shows that
drinking wine made from Bordeaux grapes is why the French, who are
famous for eating nothing but goose liver and brie, have fewer
heart attacks than Americans. Eat eggs. Drink wine. Be happy.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, red Bordeaux doesn't appear on this list of the 118 most
nutritious foods. Maybe wine isn't considered a food, strictly
speaking. Or maybe Natural Health hasn't caught up with the latest
research. It changes so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Where was I? Apricots. Avocados. Nectarines. Sturgeon?
</P>
<P>
   Does sturgeon caviar count? It might even be doubly nutritious,
since it's eggs. It's an expensive way to get your MDR of vitamin
A, but nobody ever said trying to live forever would be cheap. It's
not easy, that's for sure. Planning how to acquire and eat even
half of these 118 most nutritious foods could bring a person to her
knees.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil nuts. Brown rice. Catfish. Chia seeds?
</P>
<P>
   According to yet another study released last week, people who
attend religious services once a week live longer than those who
don't. Other recent studies have shown that those who meditate or
do yoga live longer. Laughing can lengthen life span, too,
according to another well-publicized study. And it seems that every
time you turn around, another piece of research emerges showing
that an active sex life promotes longevity. Assuming you're in the
mood. No wonder everybody wants to live forever.
</P>
<P>
   What else? Tea. Drinking tea, black or green, is an absolutely
essential part of the longevity plan. Garlic is a must, too. And
soy, of course. And whey, as in curds and whey. Why whey? Why not.
Whey is hot. This month, at least. I read about whey in Life
Extension magazine, a publication devoted to just what its title
implies. Its pages are filled with ads for a staggering array of
ads for dietary supplements aimed at extending life span.
</P>
<P>
   Is anybody doing research on people who try to do everything
necessary to extend their life spans? I wouldn't be surprised to
pick up the paper one morning and find that they die earlier than
average. Meanwhile, I'm hedging my bets.
</P>
<P>
   Guava. Parsnips. Quinoa . . .

SUPPORTING CAST GIVES `CHICAGO' LEGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
CHICAGO 
Musical in two acts, with music by John Kander and lyrics by Fred
Ebb. Book by Bob Fosse and Fred Ebb based on play by Maurine Dallas
Watkins 
Directed by Walter Bobbie. Choreography, Ann Reinking. Set, John
Lee Beatty. Costumes, William Ivey Long. Music director, Vincent
Fanuele. Originally directed and choreographed by Fosse 
Starring: Ann Reinking, Ruthie Henshall and Adrian Zmed. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Elvis didn't know when to do it. Sinatra didn't know
when to do it. Why should Ann Reinking know when to do it?
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Ann Reinking exploded onto Broadway when she replaced
Gwen Verdon in ``Chicago.'' Her jaw-dropping athletic swirls and
kicks injected the show with sexy vitality. Her legs reached for
the sky in a magnificent celebration of themselves. Nearly a
quarter-century ago, her dancing dazzled us.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, I had the privilege of observing the
choreographer Reinking fine-tune the second touring company of
``Chicago.'' She saw everything. If a dancer was a fraction of an
inch short, Reinking caught it. If another was trying to round off
a sharp step, she sympathetically pointed it out. And, let me put
this as kindly as I can: Ann Reinking, the choreographer of the
current ``Chicago'' at the Shubert Theatre, would never hire Ann
Reinking, the dancer. Never.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not privy to the conflicts that must have accompanied the
decision to coax Reinking out of retirement to replace the injured
Sandy Duncan. There's no doubt the Reinking name sells tickets. The
run has been extended two weeks. But her performance does an
injustice to her legend and her colleagues. Watching her dance in
``Chicago'' is like listening to Sinatra, during his final tour,
stumble through the lyrics to ``My Kind of Town.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago'' is my kind of musical.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't owe as much to the town as it does to the image
Chicago conjures up in the popular imagination. Sex and
speak-easies. Wise guys and even wiser gals. Director-choreographer
Bob Fosse, who had a tortured love-hate relationship with both his
art and the audience, laid everything on the table in this tabloid
tale of ``murder, greed, corruption, violence, exploitation,
adultery, and treachery.''
</P>
<P>
   He wanted the cast to seduce the audience _ to render us
speechless in his world, a world defined by body language where
spectators are stunned by sexy acrobatics. From the egomania of the
slimy Billy Flynn, played competently by Adrian Zmed, to Ruthie
Henshall's erotic Velma Kelly and Carol Wood's prison matron, the
show retains the trappings of Fosse's vision but not the heart and
soul.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the show hit town _ featuring Jasmine Guy,
Charlotte d'Amboise, and Obba Babatunde _ it was understandably
celebrated. The jazzy, pulsating score was at one with the dancers,
who looked as if they could out-hustle the Chicago Bulls in their
prime. The spare set, with the orchestra in a center box flanked
simply by two ladders and a few chairs, focused attention where it
should be _ on the talent.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the magnificent score, the one consistent element in
this generally languid production is the supporting cast. The stars
should take their cues from their anonymous underlings who
revitalize the proceedings with a well-defined, energetic rendition
of the ``Cell Block Tango.'' In fact, instead of using star power
to draw ticket sales, the producers might consider promoting from
within and trusting the audience to embrace the talented newcomers.
They have the legs that gives ``Chicago'' legs.
</P>
<P>
   And that, after all, is what Fosse was after. Angry legs. Exotic
legs. Legs that stretch to the ceiling. Legs that belong to the
pounding, athletic style of Gene Kelly rather than Fred Astaire's
subtlety and grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago'' sweats. But this one doesn't. And though Reinking
gets great marks as a trouper, she seems to be the only one left
breathless at the end of a long evening.
</P>
<P>
   Velma greets the crowd at the opening of the second act with
``Hello, suckers. Welcome back.'' This time, she's not kidding.
Unlike the Broadway production and the previous touring company,
this production ultimately fails. And no matter how many knowing
winks and comic asides Reinking delivers, they can't disguise the
fundamental problem that she's just not in the kind of physical
condition required for this demanding show. This time ``Chicago''
slipped us the old razzle-dazzle, playing us for suckers.

WINNING JULIE HARRIS PLAYS `THE GIN GAME' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the morning after the Littleton, Colo., shootings, and the
subject is inescapable.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Julie Harris, 73, the recipient of 10 Tony nominations
and an unprecedented five Tony Awards for acting, is on the phone
from her room in the Watergate Hotel in Washington, D.C. She's
costarring in Washington with Charles Durning in a national tour of
``The Gin Game,'' D. L. Coburn's Pulitzer Prize-winning
two-character play. The massacre in Littleton reminds her of
Shakespeare's line in ``Hamlet'' about ``the heartache and the
thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to.'' She deplores the
hate that seems to animate so many, from Colorado to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Harris's character in ``The Gin Game'' is animated not by
hatred, but by _ well, here's how Harris describes her: ``At the
end, finally, Fonsia realizes what she's done. All she had to do
was let Weller win a couple of games. But she's abandoned and
ruined him. `Oh, no,' she thinks. She realizes it's exactly what
she did to her son and to her husband. She's been doing it all her
life. It's a powerful lesson. It makes you want to say, `Come on,
we've got to love one another.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The action of the play pits Fonsia against Weller in a series of
gin games, during which the two elderly characters get to know each
other _ and we get to know them _ in conversations that grow
increasingly sharp as Fonsia wins hand after hand.
</P>
<P>
   Harris says she's not absorbed by gin, cards, games or even the
spirit of competition. ``My mother and (older) brother Bill were
game players. I don't care whether I win or lose, but my brother
and mother cared. My uncle plays bridge and if he loses it carries
over into the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked onstage with Ethel Waters and Rex Harrison. I knew
they had egos. But ego should be tempered with humility. Judi Dench
says that acting isn't the whole of life _ family and friends are
the whole of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Playwright Coburn, speaking on the phone from Dallas later, says
Harris successfully merges the ``very nice person'' she is in real
life with Fonsia's ``fully vindictive, sharp-edged'' character. But
he clearly means that making herself less than nice is a feat of
acting.
</P>
<P>
   Harris's big break occurred in 1950, when she played Frankie
Addams, the motherless 12-year-old tomboy who's convinced that
she'll be going along on her brother's honeymoon in Carson
McCullers's poignant ``The Member of the Wedding.'' Reprising the
role in the movie earned her an Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Frankie was only Harris's first indelible character. In 1952,
she appeared in John Van Druten's ``I Am a Camera,'' the play that
foretold the durable musical ``Cabaret.'' Harris played the
indefatigable party girl Sally Bowles, earning her first Tony
Award. (She also took the role in the 1955 movie.) Her second Tony,
in 1956, was for her St. Joan in Lillian Hellman's adaptation of
Jean Anouilh's ``The Lark.'' There was a third Tony in 1969 for
``Forty Carats,'' and a fourth in 1973 for her Mary Todd Lincoln in
James Prideaux's ``The Last of Mrs. Lincoln.'' In 1977, she won her
historic fifth Tony for her definitive Emily Dickinson in William
Luce's ``The Belle of Amherst,'' directed by her good friend
Charles Nelson Reilly. (He's also directing this ``Gin Game,'' the
11th production in which they've worked together.)
</P>
<P>
   Coburn says that actors who've played Weller Martin, Fonsia's
opponent in gin, ``see themselves in Weller'' while actresses ``get
to Fonsia by a process,'' a process that requires making her
sympathetic while seeming hard. The irony, says Coburn, is that the
actresses win the awards. ``Jessica Tandy, a previous Fonsia, won a
Tony; Julie won a Tony nomination,'' he says. He says the marriage
of Tandy and Hume Cronyn ``showed through'' their acclaimed
performances in the roles. Harris, who saw Cronyn and Tandy perform
the piece on stage when she was ``20 years younger,'' thinks she
and Durning _ friends who've played opposite each other several
times _ are ``funnier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Durning is funny. When I first played opposite him, he was a
Shakespearean clown. And Reilly is a very funny man,'' says Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn says when he conceived the play, it was around ``a man
and woman in conflict, a conflict in souls. . . . The man was of a
particular temperament; the woman was fragile and vulnerable but,
it turned out, an iron maiden.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Weller, the conflict involves God. Weller's fate comes out
through a simple card game. It becomes the most important thing in
his life. It symbolizes his loss of control _ as if any of us ever
has control over our lives; if we do, it's earlier, not at this
stage of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Coburn, an avid gin player himself, says Fonsia's streak of luck
is ``not beyond the pale'' of reality. He was once losing heavily
to a someone on a lucky streak in Mexico when suddenly earthquake
tremors began shaking the chandelier above them. ``It's an
earthquake,'' his opponent exclaimed. ``Shut up and deal,'' Coburn
replied.

DIEHARD `STAR WARS' GET TO THE HEAD OF THE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JASON LLOREN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``Star Wars'' fan Khari Crowder set up camp
Saturday on the sidewalk near the Coronet Theater. Next to him was
a big banner that declared: ``I'M FIRST.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could be here a month, I would,'' said Crowder, who works
for a San Francisco radio station under the name Krazy K.
</P>
<P>
   He was among the handful of fans who began lining up at the
movie house, hoping to snag tickets to the long-awaited ``Star
Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace.'' The line _ a scene repeated
in many other cities _ is expected to balloon as the film's May 19
opening approaches. Advance ticket sales begin a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long wait and a lot of work for a movie that isn't even
officially set to play at the Coronet. But it looks like The Force
is with the fans: United Artists Theaters executive vice president
Mike Pade believes the deal is ``99.9 percent done'' with film
distributor Twentieth Century Fox to book ``Episode I'' at the
Coronet.
</P>
<P>
   Crowder said he first showed up Friday night but the police told
him to move. So he slept in his van, which was parked nearby.
</P>
<P>
   He was back in the same spot Saturday, lounging on a lawn chair.
He said he was prepared to wait until opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't call him `Krazy' for nothing,'' said a co-worker
who dropped by to see him.
</P>
<P>
   For other fans camped out, the wait is a minor inconvenience to
see the first ``Star Wars'' installment since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting for this moment for 15 years,'' said A.J.
Nappa, a 20-year-old San Francisco resident who staked out a piece
of pavement a few feet from the theater's box office. For him, it's
not just a movie. ``This is a defining moment for our generation.''
</P>
<P>
   He and friend Joe Buckley began their camp-out Saturday at 9
a.m. Their spirits were up as they munched on pizza and played
Monopoly _ the ``Star Wars'' edition, no less. The wind threatened
to blow away their Monopoly money.
</P>
<P>
   But even then they seemed prepared to weather the nearly
three-week wait. Stashed away in their cars were tents, sleeping
bags and other necessities. More friends will join them as the days
pass, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Round Table Pizza, a few doors from the Coronet, welcomes any
extra business the ``Star Wars'' hype brings. Assistant manager
Peter Kwan said he's used to blockbuster films sparking big crowds,
but he's not used to seeing a line form so early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think ``Star Wars' is going to be the biggest,'' Kwan said.
</P>
<P>
   Nappa, Buckley and his friends plan to watch the classic ``Star
Wars'' trilogy on the eve of the film's opening _ right where
they're camped, using a TV, VCR and gas generator.
</P>
<P>
   The moviegoers at the Coronet aren't alone in their enthusiasm.
Over the weekend, there were signs of ``Phantom'' fever spreading:
</P>
<P>
   _ More than 15,000 fans overwhelmed the Wings Over the Rockies
Air and Space Museum in Denver for the three-day ``Star Wars
Celebration,'' a Lucasfilm- sanctioned event featuring cast, crew,
props and merchandise _ enough to make the most rabid Jedi junkie
drool.
</P>
<P>
   _ FAO Schwarz, Toys R Us and other chains prepared to open
Monday at 12:01 a.m. to hawk long-awaited ``Episode I'' goods, such
as plastic light sabers, talking action figures and toy spaceships.
Merchandise sales from the classic trilogy have raked in more than
$4 billion and the new film is expected to match that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phantom Menace,'' which opens in 2,500 theaters on opening
day, is expected to surpass the $1.78 billion grossed worldwide by
``Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back'' and ``Return of the Jedi.''
Some even think it may sink ``Titanic's'' record-setting $1.84
billion worldwide receipts.
</P>
<P>
   The $115 million film is a ``prequel'' set about 30 years before
the first ``Star Wars'' film. One part of the storyline tells of a
9-year-old slave boy named Anakin Skywalker, who eventually becomes
the infamous Darth Vader of the trilogy. The plot also centers
around a brewing galactic war involving the Trade Federation and
the Republic of pre-Imperial days.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley, 19, tried to explain the appeal of the ``Star Wars''
series that has kept it a cult favorite since the first film
appeared in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched a lot of movies and that's just the one that
grabs you,'' he said. ``The movie's magic is still there.''

PAT BARKER, ON THE HOME FRONT

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
ANOTHER WORLD 
By Pat Barker 
Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux. 278 pp. $24 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   However blurred the gender lines of contemporary fiction, war is
a literary province that has belonged largely to men, for a couple
of obvious reasons: They are the ones who have fought it, and
they're the ones who came of age in a toy-soldier world, thereby
grasping (often seduced by) its imaginative allure. This
double-edged privilege has given us stories that romanticize war as
well as those that wholly condemn it, most of them witness to a no
man's land where mostly men have been.
</P>
<P>
   Then came British writer Pat Barker, whose First World War
``Regeneration'' trilogy (published here through the early '90s)
captured the sickening emptiness of the Somme and the ravages of a
soldier's mind, all of it delivered in the elegiac tradition of
Hemingway. Already acclaimed in England for the gritty realism of
such early works as ``Union Street,'' Barker brought to her war
novels a fiercely authentic sense of the losses incurred from the
outset: the class distinctions of the British army, the yellowing
skin of a munitions factory worker, the failures of even medicine
and language to offer salve or understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another World,'' Barker's first novel since the trilogy ended
with ``The Ghost Road'' (1996), has an old soldier at its center,
and its laconic, blistering family drama combines elements both of
her domestic novels and of her war stories. Set in contemporary
Newcastle, in northern England, the story's close-focus plot lacks
the poetic reach of her earlier work; still, Barker can do more
with less than most of her peers. With its dying centenarian and
its murderous children, ``Another World'' conveys the modern family
in all its thwarted glory _ riddled with unhappiness but bound
together by something less precise, waiting on the future and yet
shackled to the present by the past.
</P>
<P>
   The details of these characters' lives outside their nuclear
realm are sparse; what matters is the web of intimacy they've
created and hang suspended in. Nick Halford, the somewhat reluctant
head of the family, is an academic; his second wife, Fran, is
pregnant with the couple's second child together. Jasper, their
toddler, is at the mercy of his horridly alienated half-brother,
Gareth, Fran's 11-year-old son. And now the happy clan has been
joined by 13-year-old Miranda, Nick's daughter by his first
marriage; her visit is precipitated by her mum's recent reentry
into a psychiatric hospital.
</P>
<P>
   So we know from the outset of ``Another World'' that this is
hardly going to be the Swiss Family Robinson, with everyone working
together toward mutual survival; what's conveyed instead is a
milieu of exhaustion and silent anger that seems poised to blow.
Barker suggests this volatility with frightening efficiency:
Gareth, for instance, who spends most of his waking hours playing
video games, finishes his toilette each night by wiping his
stepfather's toothbrush around the inside rim of the toilet. The
boy never knew his father; Fran, for her money, remembers him as
``a stain on the sheets.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Barker's gifts is her mix of compassion and bleak
realism, and if Nick and his haphazard tribe are bound together by
duty and misery, they also seem oddly normal. Love lurks in the
room, somewhere, even if no one has the energy anymore to summon
the word. When Nick collects Miranda at the train station, they've
just moved into an old Victorian on Lob's Hill and are trying to
make the place livable. Peeling off the wallpaper in the living
room one evening, they discover an intact portrait of the family
who lived there a century ago: the Fanshawes (``like `Wuthering
Heights,' '' Miranda says brightly), who had a war industrialist as
their patriarch, and who guarded a family secret that would raise
the hair even on Gareth's young neck. Well, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bronte, sort of, but also like Hawthorne, who wrote an
early Gothic novel by the same name. Barker has superimposed this
story _ the perilous fate of the Fanshawes, perhaps sealed by the
old man's profiteering _ upon Nick and his gang, one assumes in
order to suggest the hazy emotional parallels of history, or at
least the commonalities of memory. It doesn't quite work. The novel
takes on a ghostly sheen, at least episodically, where young girls
hover about in long dresses and where bad things happen to good
people. But this post-Gothic poke in the ribs is no match for the
story of the real paterfamilias of Nick's family: his grandfather
Geordie, ``fragile and indestructible as thistledown,'' who
survived the First World War only to battle a lifetime of memories
_ now dying of cancer, hardly peacefully, at the age of 101.
</P>
<P>
   Nick's respite from his family, if you can call it that, is the
deathwatch he keeps over his beloved Geordie, who has been more a
father to him than a grandfather. At the center of their long,
muted goodbye is the memory of Geordie's brother, Harry, who died
alongside him at the Somme and about whom Geordie speaks only in
troubled dreams and half-sentences. This is Barker's territory, and
she invokes it beautifully _ even the last agonies of Geordie's
illness are fearlessly rendered with a master's timing. But in
constructing two competing stories that are supposed to elucidate
one another, she's created a problem similar to the one that
plagued ``The Ghost Road'': Borrowing from Peter to pay Paul, she
winds up shortchanging them both.
</P>
<P>
   The title of ``Another World'' refers, fluidly and repeatedly,
to the various realities offered and imposed by our perceptions:
the passage of time, the unreliability of memory, the malleability
of history. These are grand themes, and sometimes the novel lives
up to them; Barker's confidence as a stripped-down, elegant stylist
is evenly matched by her moral depth. Sometimes, though, you can
feel her family drama straining for the higher scaffolding beyond
its reach. What feels right-sized in both conceit and execution is
the old soldier himself: noble and cantankerous and facing death
with grim necessity, which is a far less fancy phrase than courage
and one that Geordie would probably prefer. For if Barker knows
brilliantly that memory is what makes us human, she also
understands its price: the cost tallied daily not just by what
we've lost, but by what we can't undo.

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR

<TEXT>
<P>
   Not only is there life after ``The Phantom Menace'' this summer,
there's life before it, too. Once George Lucas's behemoth ``Star
Wars'' prequel dropped into the May 19 slot, the other films began
filling up summer's open parking spaces fast. On the calendar,
summer begins June 21. In Hollywood, summer begins this Friday.
That's because summer is the season when studios make the largest
chunk of their money _ 40 percent _ and there are only so many
summer weekends. Between now and Labor Day, look for more than 100
releases. They'll be looking for you.
</P>
<P>
   The parade starts Friday with a face-off between remakes:
Shakesepeare's ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' and the old Boris
Karloff horror classic ``The Mummy.'' It won't stop until Julia
Roberts, Liam Neeson, Brendan Fraser, and Hugh Grant weigh in twice
each, in different films, while Michelle Pfeiffer, Will Smith, John
Travolta, Adam Sandler, Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Mike Myers,
Sharon Stone, Richard Gere, Pierce Brosnan, Spike Lee, and
animations ranging from ``Tarzan'' to a ``South Park'' spinoff
jockey for screens. Here's a list of the entries, in order of
opening date:
</P>
<P>
   ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' (Friday) _ Shakespeare's back in
Hollywood for yet another all-star go at his summer of love in the
dreamy woods, orchestrated by Stanley Tucci's Puck, who observes
what fools Michelle Pfeiffer, Kevin Kline, Calista Flockhart,
Rupert Everett, Stanley Tucci, and Christian Bale be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mummy'' (Friday) _ Brendan Fraser, having played George of
the Jungle, this time plays the guy in the Egyptian tomb. Not the
old Karloff character in the dusty tape, but the one fighting him,
alongside love interest Rachel Weisz. The joker here is that
plutocrat Lucas's Industrial Light &AMP; Magic supplied the mummies and
other monsters added in by special effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tea with Mussolini'' (May 14) _ If you've been wondering what
Oscar-winner Judi Dench would do for an encore after Queen
Elizabeth I, here's the answer. She stars alongside compatriots
Maggie Smith and Joan Plowright in a period piece drawn from the
childhood of Franco Zeffirelli. Lest you suspect a Brits-only plot,
be advised that the fourth star is Cher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' (May 19) _ OK, OK, you
already know that this first of three prequels to the ``Star Wars''
trilogy focuses on Darth Vader as a cute, gifted, pre-Dark Side
tyke (Jake Lloyd) alongside Liam Neeson's Jedi Master and Natalie
Portman as Luke Skywalker's and Princess Leia's mom. How can you
not? The only question is whether it's of a piece with the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Love Letter'' (May 21) _ Give it credit for having the
guts to go up against ``The Phantom Menace,'' though it's hardly
aimed at the same demographic. This one, filmed in Rockport last
summer, finds Kate Capshaw's bookstore owner taking a romantic
flyer with Tom Everett Scott's younger man, cheered on by Ellen
DeGeneres, Tom Selleck, and Gloria Stuart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notting Hill'' (May 28) _ Let's hear it for Julia I. In her
first of two romantic comedies this summer, Roberts plays a movie
star who's also a diva (she insists it's fiction). While in London,
she meets and beds Hugh Grant's shy bookstore owner. He really does
some acting, pretending to be a stranger to media craziness, as she
teaches him the joys of dodging paparazzi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thirteenth Floor'' (May 28) _ This Roland Emmerich sci-fi
project, greenlit long before ``The Matrix,'' would love to ride
that film's flashy coattails as it straddles a story line that
shuttles beteeen 1937 and the present, set in motion by a tycoon's
mysterious death and tied to razzle-dazzle special effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instinct'' (June 4) _ Here's some casting against type, in an
unusual story about a world-class primatologist accused of killing
two park rangers in a gorilla preserve in Kenya. Anthony Hopkins is
the accused, maintaining a stony silence and a primitive nobility.
Cuba Gooding Jr. _ presumably taking a cue from Robin Williams _
plays the shrink who tries to rehab him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' (June 11) _ Here comes
Mike Myers again, as his joky little film turns into a franchise.
Back he comes in several guises, in fact, including Powers and his
nemesis, Dr. Evil. The level of humor in this goof on the '70s is
indicated by the names of Heather Graham's character (Felicity
Shagwell) and Kristen Johnson's (Ivana Humpalot).
</P>
<P>
   ``The General's Daughter'' (June 11) _ It's John Travolta time
again, this time in a thriller rising from an uncivil action. He
plays an army officer investigating the vicious murder of the
general's daughter. To do it, he must negotiate a minefield of
cover-ups inhabited by Madeleine Stowe, James Woods, Timothy
Hutton, and James Cromwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarzan'' (June 18) _ If it's summer, it must be another Disney
animation. This one, voiced by Tony Goldwyn as Edgar Rice
Burroughs's swinging single and Minnie Driver as Jane, will bring
new meaning, the studio hopes, to the concept of Hollywood and
Vine. If it should click, look for Disney to replicate it in the
Broadway musical jungle, to say nothing of the merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' (June 18) _ Pierce Brosnan isn't
James Bond here, but he wouldn't mind if some of 007's suave style
rubbed off on this millionaire art thief. Rene Russo and Denis
Leary costar in this remake of one of the great Boston movies. The
1968 version starred the late Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway.
She'll be seen here in a cameo role as Brosnan's therapist.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut'' (June 18) _ Here's a
movie about offending people, starting with the MPAA, which has
rated it R. Only fitting, since the movie is an anti-censorship
outing about kids subverting a stern ratings committee formed after
they sneak into an R-rated movie and learn a few words we can't
print here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Daddy'' (June 25) _ Given Adam Sandler's box-office action
in ``The Water Boy'' and ``The Wedding Singer,'' the title probably
refers to the movie, and the studio's wishful thinking about its
take. It's less likely to refer to his loser character in it, a law
school grad named Koufax who strikes out a lot until he grows up by
taking care of a 5-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Ideal Husband'' (June 25) _ After years of being regarded
as a one-play author (``The Importance of Being Earnest''), recent
revivals of this work and of ``Lady Windermere's Fan'' have
reminded the world of Oscar Wilde's generosity and dazzling wit.
Cate Blanchett, Jeremy Northam, Minnie Driver, Rupert Everett, and
Julianne Moore restore it to its high gloss.

   ``Wild Wild West'' (July 2) _ Will Smith, the box-office king of
July 4 on the basis of ``Independence Day'' and ``Men in Black,''

Branagh and a giant mechanical tarantula. Kevin Kline and Salma
Hayek provide moral _ and, when necessary, immoral _ support.
</P>

   ``Arlington Road'' (July 9) _ Jeff Bridges, a professor who has
made a study of domestic terrorism after his FBI-agent wife was
killed in a shoot-out, doesn't like what he sees when new neighbors
Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack move in next door. The result is a film
of disturbing pertinence, done in a way that sets it apart from

secrecy and security surrounding the film and its reclusive maker

<P>
   ``The Haunting'' (July 23) _ Jan De Bont revs up the special
effects to turn this remake of Shirley Jackson's ``The Haunting of
Hill House'' into a high-tech creepfest. Liam Neeson, demoted from
Jedi Master to ordinary prof, plays mind games with Lili Taylor,
Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Owen Wilson, only to find the house
playing games with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fight Club'' (July 23) _ Director David Fincher, who led Brad
Pitt through the stygian ``Seven,'' this time leads him into the
bloody underground world of private fight clubs. Accompanying
Pitt's sadomasochistic character through the ultraviolence is a
dysfunctional couple played by Edward Norton and Helena Bonham
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Runaway Bride'' (July 30) _ Just because she's co-starring
opposite Richard Gere again, and being directed by ``Pretty Woman''
director Garry Marshall again, don't push the parallels, Roberts
advises. Here she plays a woman who never can quite make it all the
way down the aisle, which piques the interest of headline-hungry
reporter Gere, who investigates and is hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer of Sam'' (July 30) _ Spike Lee's hot-button take on New
York City's Son of Sam killings of the 1970s and the vigilantism
they generated in a Bronx Italian neighborhood. John Leguizamo,
Mira Sorvino, Jennifer Esposito, Adrien Brody, Anthony LaPaglia,
Patti LuPone, Ben Gazzara, and Bebe Neuwirth play the locals who
seethe more than Michael Badalucco's killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Blue Sea'' (July 30) _ We're going to see a lot of
thrillers about genetic engineering gone wrong. This one not only
is among the first, but plugs its cautionary tale into an
experiment designed to produce big-brained sharks. This should give
it a certain jaws-dropping appeal, as Samuel L. Jackson, Thomas
Jane, and LL Cool J slip into their wet suits to cope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mystery Men'' (August 6) _ Comic-book antiheroes goof on the
superhero movie as Ben Stiller's sputtering nerd leads fellow
shleps William H. Macy, Hank Azaria, Janeane Garofalo, Wes Studi,
and Paul Reubens against Geoffrey Rush, playing an archfiend named
Frankenstein in a place named Champion City. A possible sleeper,
given the cast, which also includes Tom Waits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' (August 13) _ Hugh Grant again, this time
as an art dealer whose girlfriend (Jeanne Tripplehorn) wants to
plug him into a Mafia connection (James Caan) determined to use his
gallery as a money-laundering device. Grant doubled as director
when this romantic comedy needed reshoots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dudley Do-Right'' (August 13) _ Another blast from the past
for Brendan Fraser, who this time returns to dorkdom as the
dimwitted Canadian Mountie from Jay Ward's 1960s animated TV
series. British actor Alfred Molina, who sneers with the best of
them, plays the heavy, Snidely Whiplash. Sarah Jessica Parker is
the virginal Nell Fenwick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Muse'' (August 20) _ Speaking of shleps, Albert Brooks
plays a low-level Hollywood writer praying for inspiration, then
having his prayers answered by Sharon Stone's contempo LA muse. It
goes so well that he begins to fear she'll desert him for top-dog
screenwriter Jeff Bridges. Stone finds ways, we are assured, to
make her comedy debut sexy as well as funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Killing Mrs. Tingle'' (August 20) _ ``Scream'' scribe Kevin
Williamson makes his directing debut in this dark movie he says is
more comedy than screamfest, though hardly bloodless. ``Dawson
Creek'' diva Katie Holmes stars as a high-schooler who figures
there's nothing wrong with her grades that bondage and a crossbow
can't cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Astronaut's Wife'' (August 27) _ Sci-fi thriller starring
Johnny Depp as a NASA guy who comes back from a space shot unable
to remember what happened when he briefly blacked out, and Charlize
Theron as his wife who becomes pregnant, then begins to harbor dark
suspicions that the life in there is from out there.

TERI HATCHER MAKES HER STAGE DEBUT IN A FAMOUS ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Scrunched up in the theater balcony, in clothes so
baggy they leave everything to the imagination, new mom Teri
Hatcher is discussing her breasts.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher finds it vaguely disturbing when strangers on the street
do this _ and they still do _ but she also knows she's got a pair
of pop-culture icons under that sweatshirt. After all, they starred
in not one but two episodes of ``Seinfeld,'' including the must-see
sendoff. Suddenly the whole world seemed to know that ``They're
real, and they're spectacular,'' as her parting shot at an
uncertain Jerry went.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that funny, how much attention that line got?'' says
Hatcher, who by then was already accustomed to the attention that
comes from having one of the most downloaded images on the
Internet. ``It comes up all the time. It's sort of stuck with me,
but, hey, that's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot is OK with Hatcher these days. She's got a new baby, a new
home in New York, and a new way to risk her reputation six days a
week. With no theater experience, little voice training, and even
less guarantee that she wouldn't be hooted off the stage, Hatcher
stepped into the role of Sally Bowles, the pathetic party girl at
the center of ``Cabaret.''
</P>
<P>
   No question Hatcher has guts. Whether she has the goods is open
to interpretation. Some reviews love her, others hate her, and the
audience, she says, can go either way on any given night. With
small tables set around the stage to resemble a Berlin cabaret, the
feedback is immediate. All she has to do is glance at the lip of
the Wilshire Theatre stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the tradeoff; you get both sides,'' Hatcher says. ``There
have been nights where every single person in those front tables
has sat there with their arms not just crossed, but clenched,
looking at you like there's not a chance in hell you will ever win
them over. Then there are nights where everyone sitting there has a
smile on their face. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``And then there are nights when those same scowlers are crying
at the end and are so moved they can barely clap, but you know why
they're not clapping,'' she adds. ``This play is such a big trip
and I feel like if people want to come and I have to win them over,
then that's my job. I don't get mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Now winding up in Los Angeles, where ``Cabaret'' has played to
good-size crowds, Hatcher next has to woo audiences in Boston. The
production opens May 7 at the Colonial Theatre, with 35
performances scheduled over the four-week run. That's about 56,000
tickets, 56,000 chances to convince people she belongs in the role
immortalized by Liza Minnelli and then reworked to stunning effect
by Tony Award winner Natasha Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   On stage in her babydoll dresses _ looking so tiny and, yes,
flat-chested _ Hatcher doesn't try to compete with either actress.
She knows she doesn't have Minnelli's lungs or Richardson's acting
pedigree. In fact, offstage her voice drops an octave in reverence
when she recalls seeing Richardson on Broadway and how the entire
production inspired her to want to sing, dance, act like that.
</P>
<P>
   On her own, Hatcher hired a dialect coach to help her with
Bowles's British accent and a singing teacher to stretch her ``I
love to sing in the car'' soprano. She practiced scenes and got the
producers to agree to see her. They did not, however, agree to pay
her way. Hatcher, still living in Los Angeles at the time, bought
her own ticket to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me, `You'll have to audition like everyone else,'
and I was like, `Great,' '' Hatcher says, drawing out the word to
emphasize that she means it. ``It was one of the first times that I
was so inspired. I really just was inspired to audition. You know,
I never thought I'd get the part.''
</P>
<P>
   Competing against other name actressess, actresses with Broadway
experience, not to mention any theater experience at all, Hatcher
won over her first, crucial audience. She says she thinks they
wanted someone with a raw, untrained voice, not a professional
Broadway belter _ a vixen who could project vulnerability. Hatcher
is the first to admit she's learning as she goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did joke, about three weeks into rehearsal, that if I get
creamed in Los Angeles they might as well tie an anchor around my
career and throw it into the East River,'' Hatcher says, smiling
with relief that she's sitting in the balcony to tell the story.
``Yeah, I'm putting myself out there. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's a great thing that starts to come over you,'' she
adds. ``You start trusting yourself and the work you've done,
trusting the director. I mean, why would they cast someone they
thought was just totally incapable? The way this cast feels about
me and I feel about them, that's where you have to get your
strength, not from what the critics say.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher credits her parents with her willingness to take this
risk and to risk rejection in Hollywood year after year. Born and
raised in northern California, she describes her folks as
``brilliantly smart'' but too fearful of returning to the poverty
of their own childhoods to chance much themselves. Instead, she
says, they instilled in their daughter a sense that they would be
there to catch her if she failed _ and, by extension, the ability
to dream and dare.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I feel I've never made choices out of a fear of it not
succeeding,'' says Hatcher. ``What I have experienced is the
deepest, deepest pain of when they don't succeed. That's what can
be brutal about this business. I mean, not everyone is going to
like you, and that's something I think has been hard for me to
accept.''
</P>
<P>
   The people whose approval means most to her these days are the
cast members who surround her, veteran stage actors who sing,
dance, play instruments while the action unfolds. In turn, she's
effusive in her praise of them, including the accordion player
temporarily staying with her. A note tacked to the hallway bulletin
board apologizes for not mentioning ``how fabulous you all are by
name'' on ``The Tonight Show,'' then reminds them ``that's what's
in my heart. I love you all!''
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, the other night the banjo player warned her that
people were going to start mistaking her for a singer. What do you
mean? she demanded to know. Which song? The song was ``Maybe This
Time,'' one of her showcase numbers, and he meant she sounded
strong and sure. The compliment still makes her light up, the only
color on her otherwise unadorned face.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher says she doesn't have time for makeup these days, not
with the show and not with 16-month-old Emerson Rose, even if it is
actor/husband Jon Tenney's turn on the night shift. After starring
in movies such as ``Tomorrow Never Dies'' and appearing in any
number of sitcoms, Hatcher stopped seeking roles from the time
Emerson was born until ``Cabaret'' came along. Even now, she frets
about missing the bath/bedtime ritual.
</P>
<P>
   But Tenney and Emerson do drop by every Saturday between the
matinee and the evening show and treat Hatcher to dinner.
Afterward, Emerson sits in the dressing room with Mommy, both
facing the mirror, both playing dress-up. Days, Hatcher walks
around with Sally Bowle's chipped green nail polish and brassily
streaked hair and laughs to think what people must think.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher insists she doesn't buy into the whole body-conscious,
looks-obsessed Hollywood routine. She says she tries to eat well
and work out regularly and fails miserably at both. A good day, she
says, is one when she runs a brush through her hair. As Hatcher,
who is warily pushing 35, puts it, ``The way people think of me and
the way I am are definitely not the same. That's just the image.''
</P>
<P>
   She convinced the producers of ``Cabaret'' that was true. Now
she's taking her new image on the road.

HMOS' CREATOR URGES REFORM IN QUALITY OF CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The father of the HMO movement has given up on the ability of
doctors and health plans to guarantee safe medical care and now
calls for strong government regulation to improve the
``unacceptable'' quality of American medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus to improve medical care ``is not going to come from
within'' the health system, Dr. Paul M. Ellwood declared at a
Harvard University conference.
</P>
<P>
   Ellwood, who coined the term ``health maintenance organization''
and is arguably the nation's most influential health policy guru,
startled his audience Saturday with a strongly worded indictment of
US health care and the unwillingness of doctors and health plans to
improve it.
</P>
<P>
   Ellwood's change of heart largely results from a recent
near-disastrous encounter with the health care system and his
family's experiences, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uneven health care in the United States is a national
disgrace. It's unacceptable, and it can't be allowed to continue,''
said Ellwood, whose Wyoming-based Jackson Hole Group has been a
wellspring of ideas that have transformed US health care in the
last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ellwood called for government regulation of health care quality
_ review and disclosure of mortality rates, treatment
complications, success in treating diseases such as high blood
pressure and diabetes, and other indices of care. ``Ultimately this
thing is going to require government intervention,'' he said. ``The
question is what form government intervention will take. I think
whatever it is, it's going to have to be a condition of doing
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those who disagreed with Ellwood about the need for
government regulation said his opinions are likely to carry great
weight _ and possibly light a fire under efforts by physicians and
health plans to mount voluntary quality-improvement efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's Dr. Ellwood saying this, more people will hear
and listen,'' said Dr. Terry Hammons, an assistant vice president
of the American Medical Association who is leading an AMA program
that encourages doctors to examine their performance and sharpen
their skills.
</P>
<P>
   The 72-year-old Ellwood, an adviser of presidents from Richard
Nixon to Bill Clinton, has been a champion of market forces to
lower the price and raise the quality of health care. ``We thought
in proposing the HMO idea that they would respond to both price and
quality demands,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While competition temporarily tamed the double-digit medical
care inflation of the 1980s, Ellwood concludes that market forces
will never work to improve quality, nor will voluntary efforts by
doctors and health plans. (He also predicted that double-digit
increases in health insurance premiums will soon return ``with a
vengeance,'' citing fiscal hemorrhages at Harvard-Pilgrim Health
Care and elsewhere.)
</P>
<P>
   Ellwood's new position in favor of government policing _ perhaps
along the lines of the ``safety first'' approach of the Federal
Aviation Administration _ emerged from his own chilling experience
after a life-threatening accident a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   A fall from his horse crushed a vertebra in Ellwood's neck, but
did not sever his spinal cord. ``If it had, I would have ended up
like Christopher Reeve _ or worse,'' Ellwood said, referring to the
movie star whose equestrian accident left him paraplegic.
</P>
<P>
   However, immediately after the accident a sudden move could have
severed Ellwood's spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Ellwood is not paralyzed today, he said, is no
thanks to the care he received. He recounted a series of near-miss
medical adventures that could well have left him paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Encountering a young neurosurgical resident, Ellwood was
immediately commanded to stand up _ a potentially disastrous
maneuver. ``But I did it,'' he said. ``I was sedated - and he was a
doctor. When you're a patient you're vulnerable and the power slips
away from you.''
</P>
<P>
   That night, the protective collar he was wearing came off, ``and
the nurses didn't know how to put it back on.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the surgeon said he didn't need a special
surgically installed brace to immobilize his head and refused to
install it when Ellwood insisted. A second surgeon also refused to
do the operation ``because I wasn't referred by the first doctor
and because it was his golf day.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Ellwood got the care he needed, but he said the
experience _ coupled with other recent instances of poor care given
to family members _ drove him to conclude that the quality of
American medical care is worse than he realized.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make any difference how powerful you are or how
much you know,'' Ellwood said. ``Patients can get just atrocious
care and can do very little about it. I've increasingly felt that
we've got to shift the power to the patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellwood's bad experience did not involve an HMO but rather
traditional, fee-for-service doctors working in an institution that
was part of a national for-profit hospital chain. But he said care
is no better in prepaid health plans, or HMOs, and that the idea
that such plans would compete on quality has not worked as he
thought it would.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Kaiser official told me the other day, `Until better quality
attracts more patients, I don't care about it any more.' '' Ellwood
said. ``We've been talking about quality improvement for 30 or 40
years without much to show for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellwood said he has been asked if he is ``disillusioned'' with
the US health care system. ``I'd have to say no, I'm mad _ in part
because I've learned that terrible care can happen to anyone,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellwood's critique, and his call for government regulation,
generated skepticism rather than opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA's Hammons, for instance, acknowledged that he too has
been disappointed by physicians' unwillingness to participate in
voluntary quality-improvement programs. But he warned that public
disclosure of physician data would result in doctors digging in
their heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we try to push too much, I think we'll end up with a great
deal of passive-aggressive behavior _ a skill we learn in medical
school,'' Hammons said.
</P>
<P>
   Some differed with Ellwood's flat pronouncement that technical
problems in measuring quality have essentially been solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard to say, `Your hospital, or your doctor, or
your HMO, is better than that one,' '' said Paul D. Cleary, a
Harvard authority on quality measurement. ``At the same time, I
don't think we should be daunted.''
</P>
<P>
   The political obstacles to government regulation are formidable,
some observers said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellwood responded that it will take time to build political
pressure for such a change. ``You've just got to keep the heat
on,'' he said. ``We've got to build a consumer movement here.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he agreed with some observers that the specter of
government regulation might accelerate voluntary efforts among
health care providers to improve care.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I say these things,'' he said in an interview.

FOOTBALL'S NOT AN URBAN GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The melodrama of New England's wandering warriors has already
reached one crucial turn in the plot. The Patriots will not be
playing in Boston, not in its 22 wards, not alienating urban
neighbors, not taking up valuable land needed for a growing city.
</P>
<P>
   Pro football is a suburban enterprise. When the East Rutherford
Jets take on the Tempe Cardinals or the Irving Cowboys face the
Instant-Beltway-Village Redskins, many fans indulge in tailgating,
an activity forced upon them by the lack of anything else to do.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is an urban game, enhancing a city's attractions and
strengthening its economy because it is based on 81 home games a
year, not eight. Cities that build new downtown ballparks discover
that acres of parking lots are not necessary. In Denver, Coors
Field transformed Lower Downtown's blighted lots into thriving
commercial and retail life. LoDo repeals Melanie's folksong lament:
The city has replaced parking lots with an urban paradise.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, the Giants open a new ballpark next season,
but the city is building no new parking lots. Instead, it installed
a new trolley line along the Embarcadero. Added trains will arrive
at a commuter depot a block away, ferry service will be available,
and many spectators will walk from Union Square, a 10-minute stroll
away. How many pro football fans walk to the game?
</P>
<P>
   Pro football still plays mutt-in-the-manger in many cities,
distracting civic leaders and forecasting doom in a life without
field goals. The ploy has succeeded in St. Louis, Oakland, and San
Diego. The NFL's vice presidents for propaganda tour the provinces,
cooking up deals. Los Angeles, the home of the deal, resists and
somehow prospers without the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   In the odyssey of the Patriots, Boston played a crucial role in
the chalk-talk sessions run by Paul Kirk, the lawyer and former
Democratic national chairman. Kirk noticed that the city had
changed since he hauled in passes for John Yovicsin's Harvard teams
in the 1960s. A lot of Boston College rings rested on the
conference table.
</P>
<P>
   One hero emerged from the sandlots of Hyde Park. Mayor Thomas
Menino made a pro forma offer of the former incinerator land near
Massachusetts Avenue to the Patriots. The site was a logical backup
when the Patriots tried to invade South Boston, with no more
success than the British Army's attempt in March of 1776. Menino's
punt-blocking effort affirmed Boston's good intentions, but was not
taken seriously amid the hailstorm of Hartford's proffered
greenbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston site was to be a fabled ``Megaplex,'' a hideously
named public relations stunt among the many Hail Mary passes heaved
by the team's owners. The late Billy Sullivan, the first owner, was
considered feisty and insistent when he searched for a new stadium.
He now seems like Pop Warner and Santa Claus compared to his
successors, all self-designated saviors.
</P>
<P>
   When Victor Kiam, the boss of Remington, took over, the Globe's
Will McDonough predicted that he would be the first man in history
to try to cut his own throat with an electric razor. Then the
Budweiser heir, James Busch Orthwein, arrived, providing full
employment to local consultants. Former idealists from the Dukakis
era toiled like Clydesdales to sell the Megaplex before reality
derailed it.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bob Kraft, the cardboard king, is driving the bus for the
Boston-Brighton-Chestnut Hill-South Station-Neponset-Route
1-Offramp-Providence-Pawtucket-Hartford Patriots. If success is a
journey, not a destination, this franchise is a perennial Super
Bowl champ.
</P>
<P>
   Hartford, whose former hockey team now plays somewhere in the
Lesser Antilles, will win if it loses and lose if it wins. That
once-great capital, whose charms attracted Samuel Colt and Samuel
Clemens, will find its salvation not in the centrifugal forces of
shoulder pads and suburbanization, but in its own history and urban
character.

HOW LEFTISTS `DEBATE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another blast of leftist intolerance for Ward Connerly: The
remarkable man who led the fight to abolish racial preferences in
California was invited to speak about civil rights at the
University of Texas Law School a few weeks back. Connerly is
normally an eloquent speaker, but he had no hope of winning hearts
and minds in Austin on March 8.
</P>
<P>
   A gang of bullies, the self-styled Anti-Racist Organizing
Committee, turned out to prevent him from being heard. They
resorted to the usual thuggish tactics, yelling insults, pounding
the walls, stomping their feet, waving placards. One poster
demanded: ``Protect Free Speech _ Shut Connerly Up!''
</P>
<P>
   This goonish behavior had been advertised well in advance.For
days before Connerly's appearance, AROC had distributed flyers
egging students to ``shout him down.'' On the day he arrived, a
columnist in the campus paper urged students to show that
Connerly's ``rhetoric will not be tolerated,'' noting that ``at
other universities, fed-up students have forced him off stage.''
Time and again, this is how liberals debate: Not by joining the
conversation, but by stifling it.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Sharlot, the law school dean, introduced the program
with a stern warning that mob censorship would not be tolerated.
The police, he said, would eject anyone who tried to silence
Connerly. But that was just for show. The disruption began as soon
as Sharlot finished, and he did nothing to stop the hecklers.
Nobody was ejected. The mob got its way. Connerly's message was
drowned out.
</P>
<P>
   At least he's used to it. Connerly has been getting this
treatment ever since the Proposition 209 campaign three years ago.
He has been labeled an Uncle Tom, a Ku Klux Klansman, a traitor to
his race, an ethnic ``cleanser.'' It's vile, but it no longer
shocks him.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Jay Strader and Berin Szoka, two freshmen at Duke
University, have just had the shock of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Duke has been debating whether to establish a major in Hindi, a
language widely spoken (though far from universal) in India. The
call for a Hindi major has more to do with multicultural
cheerleading than with actual student demand; Duke already offers
four sections of Hindi instruction and 72 percent of the available
seats go begging.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents argue for a Hindi major not on academic grounds, but
as a vehicle for ``diversity'' and for ``welcoming'' Indian
students. A letter to the Chronicle, Duke's campus daily, declared
that ``by not implementing a Hindi major, this university is . . .
perpetuating racism and white supremacy.'' A Chronicle editorial
endorsed the major as a way to foster an ``accommodating climate
for Hindu culture'' and ``provide Hindi professors with job
security.''
</P>
<P>
   After watching the action for a while, Strader and Szoka weighed
in with letters of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Strader contrasted Hindi with statistics, another field in which
Duke does not offer a major. ``Consider the relative usefulness of
each subject: The former is a language spoken in a Third World
country overwrought by disease and poverty, while the latter is a
science of proven, inestimable value in all branches of industry
and science.'' A bit strident, to be sure (and he meant overrun,
not ``overwrought''), but clearly relevant and well within the
bounds of campus discourse.
</P>
<P>
   Strader's letter triggered a flurry of rebuttals, most of which
sprinkled him with ad hominem insults _ ``ignorant,'' ``blatantly
racist,'' ``disgusting'' _ while praising India's rich and
important culture.
</P>
<P>
   Szoka's letter, a week later, came to Strader's defense, and
took on the multiculturalists full-tilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The values of the West _ the power of reason, the sanctity of
individual rights, and the unfettered pursuit of happiness _ are
superior to the values of a primitive, impoverished country like
India,'' he wrote. ``Were it not for the British, whatever `ancient
traditions and rich culture' existed before their arrival would be
enjoyed only by the very top of India's feudal caste system.''
There was more in that vein, highly provocative stuff, a biting
retort in the tradition of anti-egalitarian polemicists from H. L.
Mencken to William A. Henry III.
</P>
<P>
   Of course Szoka expected a response; he and Strader are excited
by intellectual combat and unafraid of jabbing sacred cows. What
they didn't expect was hate mail, physical confrontations, and
death threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we ever see you out of your room . . . . We will beat you
within one inch of your life and step on you like the little shit
that you are,'' one e-mail to Szoka warned. Another advised, ``Be
particularly careful when showing your face around campus for a
while. It might not be a bad idea to bring some sort of a mask or
protection.'' Vandals broke into Strader's room and wrote on his
computer: ``We're going to kick your ass _ Mother India.'' Szoka
says three students came to his room and threatened to beat him;
Strader was likewise menaced.
</P>
<P>
   The freshmen found themselves likened to Nazis, cursed with
four-letter words, and repeatedly denounced as racists. They've
turned the threats over to the police _ ``After Littleton,'' Szoka
says, ``you have to take them seriously'' _ but what jolted them
most was the realization that their opponents have no interest in
arguing. They had imagined that at a university anything was open
to debate, even _ or especially _ the axioms of political
correctness.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are disabused. ``It seems like people don't care about
ideas here,'' Strader says. ``All they care about is protecting
their racial or ethnic turf. That wasn't what I expected when I
came to college.''

THE SCENT OF CHERRY BLOSSOMS AND JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
HOKKAIDO HIGHWAY BLUES 
Hitchhiking Japan 
By Will Ferguson 
Soho Press, 433 pp., $25. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Hokkaido Highway Blues'' begins with an end, and an abrupt one
at that. We are ready to embark on an unlikely journey, and instead
of a beginning, the opening line is the opposite: ``Cape Sata is
the end of Japan.'' This is unsettling, and the uneasiness persists
until almost the end of the brief opening chapter _ when, after
desultory encounters with a squid vendor and a Japanese tourist,
the first sakura _ cherry blossoms _ are sighted.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first of many gentle jokes played by Will Ferguson, an
irreverent itinerant exchange teacher from Canada, on this
delightful trip through the most oblique of major nations. Like
many traditional Japanese, he gets to his subject in a roundabout
way and, once he does arrive, acts a little surprised that he has
found it at all.
</P>
<P>
   Sakura are a primary symbol of Japanese culture, their startling
beauty, ephemeral life, and sudden death exemplifying some basics
of the Japanese take on human existence. Every spring, the
cherry-blossom front advances from south to north, as symbolic of
the season as the march of fall foliage from north to south in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Peak season is the occasion for song, dance, and an abundance of
rice wine. It was in just this setting one year that, Ferguson
says, he announced his intention to follow the cherry-blossom front
from beginning to end, hitchhiking the whole way from Cape Sata,
southernmost point on Japan's main islands, to Cape Soya in the
north.
</P>
<P>
   Blaming it on the sake is probably another illustration of a
Japanese social device turned to the author's purpose. Ferguson,
author of ``The Hitchhiker's Guide to Japan,'' clearly was itching
to write his own contribution to the shelves of Japan books
authored by long-term foreign residents.
</P>
<P>
   Much as a Japanese employee, if drunk enough, is forgiven for
telling off his boss, Ferguson, with his alleged drunken vow, sets
his project in motion in a way that frees it from the ponderous
pretensions and overgeneralizations that have ruined many a book on
Japan before this. Instead, well-researched history and
well-considered sociological observations are finely blended and
balanced with tales of the road, with no attempt to sum up.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchhiking along, meeting people at random but not always in
brief, Ferguson delivers observations that are sometimes touching,
sometimes amusing, and always true. Additionally, they are almost
always good-humored _ even when the subject is the generally
despised Gaijin card, which he is ordered to produce when he spaces
out while trying to hitchhike on a national highway (which is
illegal) and flags down a police car.
</P>
<P>
   The Gaijin card, he writes, in one of many dead-on
characterizations, ``is a fascist tradition that makes most
long-term residents seethe. In Japan, foreign residents must submit
to being fingerprinted and registered, and must carry their ID
cards with them at all times. . . . It is nothing short of ethnic
bullying, bureaucratically entrenched racism, institutionalized
xenophobia, etcetera, etcetera.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he continues, ``I kind of like my Gaijin card. It makes
me feel like an emigre in a spy movie . . . mulled over by security
men who eye you suspiciously and say things like `Your papers are
not in order' in deep Slavic accents. Not that this has ever
happened. This was the first time any Japanese policeman had ever
asked to see my card. I was delighted.''
</P>
<P>
   The cops released him with a good-humored warning and gave him a
lift. The episode has, in the best sense, some of the flavor of
folk singer Arlo Guthrie's encounter with police in the song
``Alice's Restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   The author's abiding interest in the subject, his sturdy good
humor, and the fact that he neither fawns over Japan nor bashes it
all contribute to his success. But it is his ability as a writer
that really makes the book work.
</P>
<P>
   Consider his reaction after failing repeatedly to get through a
confusing maze of streets to a temple he wants to visit.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he says, ``I did what any intrepid traveler would do _
I gave up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only then, as though a fog had lifted, did I notice the
neighborhood I had been trying to escape. It was one of those
villages-within-a-town-within-a-city that contains Japan like gift
boxes within gift boxes. . . . I walked deeper and deeper into the
side streets and avenues. . . . The scent of spring and wood smoke
folded itself around me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I followed an alley so narrow I could run my hands along the
houses on either side of me. I looked in on people's lives. . . . A
woman raking the driveway gravel. A man tending a garden of bonsai.
Futons hung out to catch the sun from upstairs windows like seasick
passengers slumped over the edge of an ocean liner. Clothes drying
on bamboo poles, the pants legs strung up as if in mid-karate
kick.''
</P>
<P>
   As a wordsmith and a traveler, Ferguson knows where he is going.

STEPPING UP SAVINGS TO MEET GOALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Based on the following information, can you tell me if my
husband and I are saving enough for retirement, how we should
allocate our savings, and how much we can expect to accumulate in
15 and 25 years? I am 40 and my husband is 39. I have a $20,000 IRA
invested in the Fidelity Emerging Growth fund, an account to which
I don't currently contribute. My husband has a $150,000 401(k) plan
to which he contributes $571 a month and to which his employer
contributes half that amount in the form of company stock. Because
of a change in the 401(k) plan, we need to reallocate the money,
with these fund options: Invesco Total Return, Fidelity Growth and
Income, Fidelity Spartan US Equity Index, Fidelity Magellan,
Fidelity US Bond Index, Fidelity Growth Company, Fidelity Emerging
Markets, Fidelity Diversified International, and a money market
fund.
</P>
<P>
   D.M., Stoneham, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you continue with contributions at the current level,
including those of your husband's employer, and if both the IRA and
401(k) realize average annual gains of 10 percent, you will have
$1,051,614 in 15 years and $2,899,391 in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   But before you get too comfortable, consider the likely effects
of inflation: If inflation runs at an average 3.5 percent, the
buying power of that $1,051,614 after 15 years will be equivalent
to $627,968 in today's money. Under the same assumption, the
25-year accumulation would have the buying power of $1,226,868 in
1999 dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Since you mentioned elsewhere in your letter that you have a
current annual income of $120,000, even with the 25-year
projection, you would face a pretty substantial drop in income upon
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if your husband maintains his 401(k) contributions as
a percentage of salary rather than as a dollar amount, the
contributions would increase every time he gets a raise,
effectively boosting the projected accumulations, and probably by a
lot.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while I don't like to speculate on what Social
Security will look like in 15 or 25 years, it will likely survive
in some form and improve the overall situation.
</P>
<P>
   But I'd be more comfortable if you could boost the savings
level, which currently represent only 5.7 percent of your annual
income.
</P>
<P>
   As for allocation of your savings, let's begin with your IRA. My
suggestions here are to fill in a couple of areas that aren't
available on your husband's 401(k) menu.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure quite what you hold _ Fidelity has an Emerging
Markets fund, but none I can find called Emerging Growth. If you
hold Emerging Markets, the time to sell was long, long ago. But
better late than never. I'd put half the money in Fidelity Select
Health Care fund and the remainder in Fidelity OTC.
</P>
<P>
   As for your husband's 401(k) portfolio, you don't mention how
much of the assets are in his company's stock, or whether he would
move all or some of that money to other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, you'd want to limit your holding of a single stock to a
maximum of 25 percent, and I'd be more comfortable with 20 percent
of the entire portfolio (meaning $34,000 when you include your IRA
in the calculation).
</P>
<P>
   As for the remainder, I would divide half of the money between
Fidelity Growth and Income and Fidelity Spartan US Equity Index,
both of which operate with large-cap domestic stock portfolios that
represent a blend of growth and value issues.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that one, Growth and Income, is a managed
portfolio, while the other simply tracks the stocks of the major
domestic companies. I'd then divide whatever is left between
Fidelity Diversified International and Invesco Total Return funds.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest that your husband maintain his contributions to the
401(k) along the same lines set out above, and periodically reduce
the amount of his company's stock to whatever percentage of the
total portfolio you have decided upon, putting the proceeds in the
same allocations I've suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the generous contributions of his employer, this is
something you should adjust regularly _ say on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally I have nothing at all against that company stock _
I'm suggesting the sales only to increase diversification and
reduce risk.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you decide you can and should save more, resume
contributions to your own IRA. If you made the maximum annual
contribution allowed, which would mean putting in $166.66 a month,
you would increase your overall savings rate to 7.4 percent of
income.
</P>
<P>
   These additional investments would not only add $66,446 to the
pool after 15 years and $205,709 after 25, but it would also allow
the two elements of the portfolio it represents _ mid-cap stocks
and health care stocks _ to keep pace with the segments in your
husband's account.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We are almost 80. We get $24,500 in Social Security, and we
have $7,700 in tax-free bonds, $5,000 worth of Treasury notes and
bills, and $5,900 in telephone stock. As the Treasuries mature, the
new ones pay less, but we feel safe. Which way to go?
</P>
<P>
   W. E., Chelsea, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Sometimes the security of government securities is worth the
few basis points of additional yield that you might get if you went
into less rock-solid investments.
</P>
<P>
   The only suggestion I have is to look closely at your tax
situation and question whether you are profiting from their
tax-free status.
</P>
<P>
   Would you be better off selling these and replacing them with
more Treasury notes and bills?
</P>
<P>
   You would face a federal tax liability on the interest you earn,
but the chances are that the additional yield would more than
offset the tax liability.
</P>
<P>
   And remember, the interest on these government securities is
free of Massachusetts state income tax.

 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a recent morning, David Mamet sipped his coffee, quoted the
last stanza of a Rudyard Kipling ode to honor and heroism, and, in
speaking about his latest film, ``The Winslow Boy,'' extolled such
Edwardian virtues as ``gentility, honor, and accountability.'' It
seemed an incongruous moment: such qualities are rare in the rakes
and rogues who usually inhabit Mamet's films and plays, including
the Pulitzer Prize-winning ``Glengarry Glen Ross.''
</P>
<P>
   In a career spanning three decades as an actor, playwright,
screenwriter, and director, Mamet is best known for creating
characters propelled by back-alley morals and cutthroat ethics. In
his (often) at-time profane world of (mostly) men behaving badly,
there is seldom little black or white; mostly there is an all-too
realistic ambiguity where any means necessary can be employed to
reach a desired end _ such as concocting a fake war to divert
attention from a presidential sex scandal in ``Wag the Dog,'' which
Mamet co-wrote.
</P>
<P>
   So it is odd to hear Mamet speak of such Merchant-Ivory
refinement in regards to one of his own films _ almost as odd as it
is to hear the notoriously media-reticient Mamet speak at all. But
such is the nature of his latest film, a project Mamet has dear for
two decades, which even he considers ``a departure from some of my
other work.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an understatement. Set in England in 1912, ``The Winslow
Boy'' is the story of a teenage Naval College cadet who's kicked
out of school after he is accused of stealing a five-shilling
postal order and forging the signature of the rightful owner. His
family, convinced of the boy's innocence, risks everything to
correct what they perceive as an egregious injustice. The film
(which opens Friday) stars Sir Nigel Hawthorne, Jeremy Northam,
Rebecca Pidgeon, Gemma Jones, and Guy Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   And in what could be seen as another move away from the box in
which some have attempted to place his work, Mamet _ who has been
criticized for a dearth of female characters _ will premiere his
latest play, the all-female ``Boston Marriage,'' at the American
Repertory Theatre in Cambridge, Mass. next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Winslow Boy'' is based on a real-life British incident
involving George Archer-Shee, a 13-year-old cadet booted from the
Naval College in 1908 for theft and forgery. Though little known
stateside, in England it became a subject of heated debate from the
halls of Parliament to the local pub. In 1946, the story was turned
into a four-act play, ``The Winslow Boy,'' by Terence Rattigan, who
later adpated it into a 1950 film starring Robert Donat, Margaret
Leighton, and Cedric Hardwicke.
</P>
<P>
   Mamet first saw that film as youngster in his native Chicago,
and discovered the play about 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the play, I thought, `I'd like to direct that
someday,' '' he said, during an interview at the Four Seasons
Hotel. ``Eventually, I got a chance to.''
</P>
<P>
   While writing some revisions for an off-Broadway production of
J. B. Priestly's 1934 play, ``The Dangerous Corner,'' Mamet again
became ``enthused'' with the ``genteel, Edwardian cadences'' of
Rattigan's play.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this work specifically, there was the precision of it
which I found just marvelously inviting, restful and challenging,''
Mamet said. ``It's a very Appolloian piece, as opposed to low
comedy or low drama. It's very much a drama of manners, and the
manners themselves are essential. It's a movie about Edwardian
virtues: gentility, honor, and accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Mamet's first outing directing material he didn't write.
Mamet made few changes to the 50-year-old script written by
Rattigan and Anatole de Grunwald, maintaining that Rattigan is
``the architect _ I'm just the decorator.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is magnificent material,'' he continued. ``It just
doesn't get better than this material. Some of the scenes are just
stunningly written.''
</P>
<P>
   What has continually drawn Mamet to this story is the theme of
fighting for what one believes is right. To exonerate Ronnie, the
Winslows _ father Arthur (Hawthorne), mother Grace (Jones), sister
Catherine (Pidgeon), and eldest son Dickie (Matthew Pidgeon) _ hire
hotshot barrister Sir Robert Morton (Northam). But in trying to
prevent Ronnie's expulsion, they must challenge the authority and
judgment of the Admiralty and the Crown.
</P>
<P>
   It is a stance that comes with sacrifice. Their finances
dwindle; Arthur's health deteriorates; Catherine, already an
outspoken suffragette in the early feminist movement, is pressured
by her status-conscious fiancee to drop the whole thing or he'll
break off their engagement. These issues of heroism and sacrifice
intrigue Mamet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the people who stood up to right a great
personal cause _ whether it's Emile Zola, Dr. King, Rosa Parks,
Margarethe Cammermeyer, or St. Joan,'' Mamet said, ``you say, `My
God, I hope and I pray if I'm put in that position I would be able
to be strong' because the blandishments, the things which will
cause resignation, are many.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Winslow Boy,'' Mamet finds his most heroic characters,
although there are noble souls in some of his past work. Think of
Kevin Costner's downright, upright Elliot Ness in Brian DePalma's
film version of ``The Untouchables,'' which Mamet wrote, or Don
Ameche's good-hearted Gino, the simple Italian shoemaker who will
not lie, but still convinces a mob boss that he is il capo di capo
in ``Things Change,'' which Mamet directed and co-wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an unassailable goodness to many of the people in
``The Winslow Boy,'' Mamet said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brilliance of Rattigan's story is we see the heroism
happen before our eyes. We aren't told, `This is John Wayne, this
is D'Artagnan,' '' he said, referring to the famed swashbuckler of
Alexandre Dumas's ``The Three Musketeers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We see from the very beginning a happy, contented middle-class
family which has profited so much from their time and position in
society, and is rightfully enjoying it,'' Mamet said. ``Bit by bit
they lose everything, but in return, they get to tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth pulses in the center of all Mamet works, even if that
truth concerns the flawed lives of men and women, unwilling or
incapable of doing the right thing. But the greatest Mamet truth of
all is this: He follows no path but his own.
</P>
<P>
   With the frame of a middleweight, Mamet is 51, but looks a
decade younger. His brown hair is close-cropped, and all that
betrays his age is a beard with more salt than pepper. Dressed in a
black shirt buttoned to the neck, and fatigue-green pants, Mamet is
charming but intense. He is not a man for idle conversation, and
one best pay attention or risk being left behind. The conversation
can move from boxing to Kipling (an author he reveres) to his
tendency to gain weight on movie sets, courtesy of those blasted
treat-filled catering trucks,
</P>
<P>
   He is audaciously bright, and when he talks in his deep, quiet
voice, there is nary a snippet of the hard-edged language he has
written for dozens of plays and films. He has written such films as
``The Verdict,'' ``Hoffa,'' ``House of Games,'' and last year's
twisty thriller, ``The Spanish Prisoner.'' As playwright, he has
penned ``American Buffalo,'' ``Oleanna,'' and ``The Cryptogram.''
</P>
<P>
   What has always distinguished Mamet's work is his ear for
dialogue. His words are rhythmic and alive, written with a
consciousness of how they will sound when spoken aloud. There are
conversations between characters _ the stop-and-start banter
between Ed Harris and Alan Arkin as desperate real estate salesmen
in ``Glengarry Glen Ross'' comes to mind _ as fresh and unexpected
as two jazzmen jamming.
</P>
<P>
   Equally unexpected is Mamet's new willingness to talk to the
media. In ``The Winslow Boy,'' there's a line written by Rattigan
that could easily have come from Mamet. When Arthur Winslow wonders
what to say to a newsman lurking about for a comment, Sir Robert
says, ``I hardly think it matters, sir; whatever you say will have
very little bearing on what they write.''
</P>
<P>
   Mamet usually lets his work speak for itself, but a talk with
``The Winslow Boy'' star Hawthorne made him reconsider his
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of the film, very happy with the film,'' he
said. ``I was talking with Sir Nigel, as a matter of fact, and I
said (talking to the media) is a bunch of bourgeois, isn't it? And
he said, `Absolutely not. If you have something you're proud of,
and you'd like people to see it, help them sell the product.' He
said, `In what business do you not have to drive your chickens to
market?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mamet's next ``chicken to market'' is ``Boston Marriage,'' which
has its world premiere at the ART June 4. The play stars Rebecca
Pidgeon (not only a cast member of ``The Winslow Boy'' but Mamet's
wife and frequent collaborator), Felicity Huffman (of ABC's
``Sports Night''), and Mary McCann.
</P>
<P>
   Coined in 19th-century New England, the slang term ``Boston
marriage'' often referred to a lesbian couple living together,
although it could also mean two women in a living arrangement
independent of men. Mamet describes the work as ``a comedy of
manners about two ladies of fashion at the turn of the century, and
their maid.''
</P>
<P>
   ART has premiered a number of Mamet plays, including ``The
Cryptogram,'' ``Oleanna,'' and ``The Old Neighborhood''; it's an
arrangement that suits the playwright, who lives in Newton with
Pidgeon and their children. For years, Mamet lived on Dwight Street
in Boston's South End, which he still regards fondly. He considers
Shawmut Avenue ``the most beautiful street in the United States'';
he mounted his first professional play at the Boston Center for the
Arts; and he could be spotted browsing at the annual Cyclorama flea
market and antiques show.
</P>
<P>
   He left the South End only reluctantly, and only when he could
no longer abide a problem that has vexed many a Bostonian: parking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult with the kids because there was very little
shopping and no parking. On Dwight Street, there's no room. You
have to double-park your car in the middle of the street, then try
to get your kid, and then your groceries, into the house,'' he said
with an exasperated laugh. ``It was very challenging.''

A PROSTRATE NATION BECOMES A WORLD POWER

FREEDOM FROM FEAR 
The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945 
By David M. Kennedy 
Oxford. 936 pp. Illustrated. $45 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There never was a time like the period between 1929 and 1945.
Stuffed with great change and great challenge, it left a nation
transformed, altering its character, its position in the world, its
view of its responsibilities, and its conception of its promise.
</P>
<P>
   In 1929, America was wealthy and withdrawn. By 1945 it had
tasted the depths of the Great Depression and the burdens of world
power. In 1929, it was tentative and, apart from a brief brush with
big-power tensions in World War I, untested in the world. By 1945
it was confident and muscular, the preeminent world power
economically, militarily, and culturally.
</P>
<P>
   In 1929, its worldview and its leaders were rooted in the 19th
century. By 1945, its worldview and leaders were to define the
remainder of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   This is modern America's story _ modern America's most
thrilling, most irresistible, and most significant story _ and in
this massive volume, David M. Kennedy, a Stanford University
historian, makes it his story in a way that no one has before.
``Freedom from Fear,'' the fourth installment of the new Oxford
History of the United States to appear, is as much a triumph as its
predecessors, providing every indication that the series, once
completed, will stand as the most comprehensive and most compelling
narrative history of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Kennedy's epic story is more than a fitting companion to
Robert Middlekauff's ``The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution,
1763-1789,'' James McPherson's ``Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil
War Era,'' and James T. Patterson's ``Grand Expectations: The
United States, 1945-1974.'' In many ways, the period covered by
Kennedy's work is the most astonishing era of all, a combination of
the despair of depression (the greatest the nation ever endured)
and the heroics of war (the greatest crusade of the century, maybe
of all time), with the volume ending with America, as Winston
Churchill put it, ``at this moment at the summit of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy portrays a nation so powerful that it commanded half the
earth's manufacturing capacity, so advanced that it generated half
the world's electricity, controlled two-thirds of the world's gold
_ and so dominant that it owned 100 percent of the world's atomic
weapons. ``The war had shaken the American people loose and shaken
them up, freed them from a decade of economic and social paralysis
and flung them around their country into new regions and new ways
of life,'' he writes. ``It was a war that so richly delivered on
all the promises of the wartime advertisers and politicians that it
nearly banished the memory of the Depression.''
</P>
<P>
   At the center of this story _ besides, of course, the energy and
genius of the American people themselves _ is the commanding figure
of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, truly first in war, first in peace,
and first in the hearts of his countrymen. He is the linchpin of so
much _ the connection between a nation governed by the aristocracy
and a nation moved by the impulses of mass taste; the connection
between a people who had barely any ties to its national government
and a people whose jobs, outlook, and safety depended almost
entirely on government; the connection between an America planted
in the 19th century and an America determined to shape the 20th.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave the nation a presidential civics lesson that defined
nothing less than the ideology of modern liberalism,'' Kennedy
writes. ``He breathed new meaning into ideas like liberty and
freedom. He bestowed new legitimacy on the idea of government. He
introduced new political ideas, like social security. He
transformed the country's very sense of itself, and of what was
politically possible, in enduring ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of this could have, maybe even might have, happened without
Roosevelt. But it didn't happen without him. He was there. He
presided over it all, and more, dominating the politics and culture
of the country in a way that no other leader ever has. Kennedy's
title for this volume, ``Freedom from Fear,'' is clearly an echo of
FDR's famous four freedoms, but it stands for something more _ the
Roosevelt conviction and achievement: that security, personal and
national, was the business of government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Security was the touchstone, the single word that summed up
more of what Roosevelt aimed at than any other,'' Kennedy writes.
Here is Roosevelt himself: ``I place the security of the men, women
and children of the Nation first.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Roosevelt always deserved credit for protecting the
nation's security. Kennedy is critical of FDR's preparation for the
postwar world, saying he ``banked on goodwill and personal charm to
compose the conflicting interests of nations.'' That's probably
true. But Roosevelt's bank of goodwill and personal charm still
served him, and the nation, well. It permitted him to force the
uncompromising to compromise, the irreconcilable to reconcile, the
unwilling to become willing. The result is a legacy that, for all
its faults, excesses, and inconsistencies, still is the
underpinning of American society. (The Republicans made huge gains
in the 1942 congressional elections but Social Security and some of
the other Roosevelt programs were untouched. Many of them remained
untouched through the Reagan years.)
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt came to office in another America; indeed, Kennedy
speaks of the 1930s as having ``opened a fissure across the
landscape of American history no less gaping than that opened by
the volley on Lexington Common in April 1775 or by the bombardment
of Sumter on another April four score and six years later.'' He
came to power in a country whose population was 44 percent rural,
where 45 million had no indoor plumbing and almost none had
electricity. It was a world of wood stoves and oil lamps and well
water. That was the good news. The Great Depression made things
even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Here is Kennedy's take: ``History's wealthiest nation, the
haughty citadel of capitalist efficiency, only four years earlier a
model of apparently everlasting prosperity, land of the pilgrims'
pride, of immigrant dreams and beckoning frontiers, America lay
tense and still, a wasteland of economic devastation.''
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt gave Americans hope for the future, some tools to
build a future, and a vision to sustain the future. The hope, the
tools, and the vision helped win the future, but the future was
built by the war. Roosevelt and the New Deal got the country back
on its feet; the war set it running.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a thunder squall ionizes the sultry summer air, World War
II left the American people energized, freshened, and invigorated.
Depression America had been a place of resignation, fear, and
torpor. America at war was quickened by confidence, hope, and above
all by movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy tells this story with sweep and with telling detail.
Like: Army dentists pulled 15 million teeth during World War II.
The average GI was 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighed 144 pounds. The
daily toilet paper allotment for an American soldier was 22.5
sheets (compared with the 3 sheets allotted to British soldiers).
It required more than 600 tons of supplies a day to sustain a US
combat division.
</P>
<P>
   The war cleared Europe of the Nazis, cleared Asia of its native
imperialistic threat, changed gender roles in the United States,
set in motion both the civil rights and the women's movements, and
seeded the suburbs. It changed the world, and it changed Americans'
view of the world. ``It was a war,'' Kennedy writes, ``that had
brought them as far as imagination could reach, and beyond, from
the ordeal of the Great Depression and had opened apparently
infinite vistas for the future.'' When we look back on the past, it
is clear that the future began there.

<P>
   &UR; !!! &LR;  1/2 ``The Apple'' An astonishing film from Iran, based on
a true story and featuring its principals, two 12-year-old sisters
locked since birth inside their small house in a poor Tehran
neighborhood by their fearful and befuddled old father finally
sprung by a social worker. What happens to them when they break out
into the world around them is affecting in its own right and a
potent political allegory besides. (Unrated) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !! &LR;  1/2 ``The Book of Life'' Hal Hartley's seriously trippy take on
the last day of the millennium has Martin Donovan as a reticent,
deadpan Jesus trying to decide whether it's time to kick off the
Apocalypse. The provocative premise almost overcomes the script's
lapses _ but in any case you just have to give it up for a film
that casts singer P. J. Harvey as Mary Magdalene. (Unrated) (Renee
Graham) &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FR)  &UR; !! &LR;  1/2 ``Entrapment'' Star allure carries this silly and
overextended millennium heist plot, served up with gloss and
slickness. Reliable old Sean Connery, warm and rugged as a wary
superthief who isn't afraid to show his age, and Catherine
Zeta-Jones, as his smart and shapely new partner in crime, are the
reasons to give this one a try. (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ! &LR;  ``Idle Hands'' Devon Sawa begins well as a pothead slacker
so out of it he doesn't realize his parents have been murdered,
much less that his own right hand, demonically possessed, did it.
But this stab at gory over-the-topness, culminating in the usual
mayhem at the big school dance, runs out of script long before it
runs out of fake blood. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !!! &LR;  ``Open Your Eyes'' A stylishly twisty reality-shift outing
from Spain: A handsome Casanova who treats women badly has his face
shattered by one of them, then finds himself being interviewed by a
therapist inside a prison. You'll be confused but never bored as
the film's jagged style keeps us guessing which of its several
scenarios is the one that's really happening. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !! &LR;  1/2 ``Radiohead: Meeting People Is Easy'' Mostly languorous,
95-minute authorized documentary of Radiohead's 1997 tour. The band
was breaking through to something like stardom, which seems to
entail bigger demands but no more fun. Meant for the obsessive fan,
really: It hasn't been a hard day's night for a long, long time.

DARK DOINGS IN THE ICE AND THE MOUNTAINS

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I love maps. I have collected them since well before my teens.
Maps are promises of escape and opportunity; they let me know what
is over the mountain range; they are reminders of where I have been
and of adventures good and bad. So I was delighted to be given
``Tony Hillerman's Indian Country Map and Guide'' (Time Traveler
Maps, PO Box 30, Mancos, CO 81328, $14.95).
</P>
<P>
   The map shows locations and provides descriptions from 13
Hillerman mysteries, setting out the locales from the many riveting
scenes Hillerman has given us over the years, and wedging those
locales into the Four Corners country, between the sacred mountains
of the cardinal directions as denoted by the Navajo. Having grown
up under the shadow of one of those sacred mountains (Sierra Blanca
Peak in Colorado), and having visited the other three, I have the
advantage of being able to judge the cartographer's art from
experience on the ground, and I can attest that this is a nifty map
that any map collector, and any Hillerman fan, will want.
</P>
<P>
   Just as perfect a gift would be a series of compact Oxford
paperbacks known as Oxford Twelves, each containing 12 relatively
unknown short stories. Apparently there are eight of these out,
with two more planned, though I have only three: ``Tales of
Murder'' and ``Mystery Stories,'' both edited by Jack Adrian, and
``American Crime Stories,'' edited by Rosemary Herbert. These are
editors of wide reading and good judgment, and the result is nearly
perfect. The ``Tales of Murder'' range from Richard Marsh's ``An
Illustration of Modern Science'' (1896) to Vincent Cornier's ``The
Monster'' (1951). All are good and some more than that, and though
I like to think I know a thing or two about this genre, nine of the
stories are new to me. Herbert's selections are equally fresh.
</P>
<P>
   A fine new biography, ``Teller of Tales: The Life of Arthur
Conan Doyle'' by Daniel Stashower (Holt, $32.50), also helps us
remember that there really still is a canon to this body of
literature. Stashower writes mysteries himself; as a winner of the
Raymond Chandler Fulbright Fellowship, he was able to spend a year
in England and Scotland on research, and as a result he has some
fresh things to say. I like the way he respects Conan Doyle's
yearning for a spiritualist utopia, how he sees that the people who
populate the grand master's stories are not typical Victorians (as
they so often are taken to be), and how the Edwardian period was
truly different. This is a fine biography; one needn't give a fig
for Sherlock Holmes to enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   Equally engrossing is Stan Jones's ``White Sky, Black Ice''
(Soho, $22), ``a Nathan Active investigation'' set in Chukchi,
Alaska. Active is a state trooper who is eager to get out of the
isolated village where he deals with repetitive problems of
alcoholism, drugs, snowmobile and dog sled accidents, poaching,
vandalism, and brawls. Inevitably the jacket tells us Jones is
``Tony Hillerman in snowshoes,'' and Jones is, like Hillerman, good
at demythologizing Native Americans (the book deeply involves
Inupiat culture) and at detecting fear in an apparently serene
landscape. This is a debut novel, and I look forward to more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dogsbody, Inc.,'' by L. L. Thrasher (Write Way Publishing,
10555 East Dartmouth St., Suite 210, Aurora, CO 80014, $22.95) is
not a debut, but the author is new to me. Despite the title, which
tells us that private detective Zachariah Smith will take on just
about anything in his small eastern Oregon town, the story is
sophisticated, cleverly told, with a nonstop plot and great
characterization. A doctor is killed by a sniper during a rally
outside a women's health clinic; as she was about to speak to Smith
at the time, he may have been the target. A rebellious teenager
goes missing, presumably a runaway from his feckless father and
drunken mother. Points of view on abortion are nicely but not
didactically aired. Smith is an interesting person in his right,
not just a cause of action.
</P>
<P>
   John Caine is back, and he's an old acquaintance. Earlier I
compared him to Travis McGee, but in ``Emerald Flash'' by Charles
Knief (St. Martin's, $23.95), Caine is less intellectually
resourceful _ falling into situations he might have avoided if he
had just read more books like this one _ and a good bit more
physically daring. Set in Hawaii, with some harrowing chase
sequences on Kauai, this book reinforces the ensemble actors Knief
is assembling and deploys them nicely across an action story in
which one does not want to pause too often to ask ``Why?'' Knief is
well on the way to challenging John D. MacDonald, though there is
some distance to go yet: After all, MacDonald wrote scores of
books, and we have known Honolulu's premier private eye for only
three. More, please.

<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``Babe: Pig in the City'' _ Pound for pound, this
was one of the best pictures of the year. Mired in controversy
because it was hurried into release, ``Babe 2'' never got a fair
shake. This tale does for children's movies what the Brothers Grimm
did for children's literature. Dark, dangerous, and mysterious,
this remarkably well crafted story illuminates the night that most
children fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've Got Mail'' _ A love match made in the marketing
department reunites that ``Sleepless in Seattle'' pair _ Tom Hanks
and Meg Ryan _ and tosses in the Internet. How hip. How cool. But
this bland romance should be marked ``return to sender.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mummy'' (1932) _ Boris Karloff is brilliant, in spite of
some terrible writing and an overwrought supporting cast. Director
Karl Freund incorporates outlandish lighting effects to generate
the horror. But it's Karloff that makes this B picture an A.

   DVD UPDATE: While sales of DVD players continue to mount, along
with the number of titles available on the superior format, the
prices are beginning to rise as well. Both Warner Home Video and
Columbia TriStar Home Video are keeping their prices at $25, but
other companies are releasing discs in the $30-35 range. ``A Bug's
Life,'' one of the most gorgeous of the DVDs released so far, is
marked at a rather hefty $34.99. Since demand remains strong and
disc manufacturers have trouble supplying the demand, it's a trend
that seems bound to continue. According to a survey ordered by
Video Business magazine, the average price of a DVD has risen from
$24.98 to $26.53 in two years. But that's based on suggested retail
price. The on-line services _ such as NetFlix, Amazon.com, and
Empire DVD _ still offer deep discounts.

ABC SCORES WITH `SPORTS NIGHT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We're out. Two minutes back.''
</P>
<P>
   Every week you hear that as the first commercial break comes up
on the fictional ``Sports Night'' highlights show on the
Continental Sports Channel.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, ``Sports Night'' is a behind-the-scenes look at
the characters who run what is essentially ESPN's ``SportsCenter.''
You are there, on the floor, as they fade out. You listen _
intently _ as the dialogue races between anchors, producers,
editors, makeup people and network suits. Everybody who walks onto
that set is interesting in some way.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later, the show is back on the air, and this
show-within-a-show format has you captured.
</P>
<P>
   It's this special you-are-there relationship that fuels ``Sports
Night.'' Well, that's not exactly true. It's brilliance that fuels
the show. It's amazing to think that ABC, which airs ``Sports
Night,'' isn't completely thrilled with the performance. While the
show may not be a Nielsens god, it's certainly not a bottom
dweller.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the season finale, you'll hear those familiar words
again: ``We're out. Two minutes back.'' You'll be wishing the
real-life TV show would never go away and that it had another 22
episodes to carry you over into next fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Night'' is one of television's very best shows, a rare
30-minute mix of comedy and drama that
</P>
<P>
   The show was slow to catch on with viewers but is now a runaway
train of populist love, who-would-have-guessed-it, re-evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Executive producer and writer Aaron Sorkin has created a daring
show that has consistently rewarded patient viewers. Can the show
be cloying? Absolutely. Is it heavily stylized? Yes. But so what?
At least it has style and dares to be different and damned if
you're not, after this last episode, left with the feeling that
something special is going away.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's the emotional stew of a very good TV show. And
wouldn't it be great, as May brings the TV season to an end, if we
felt that way about a lot more shows?
</P>
<P>
   The details of this finale are not as important as merely
celebrating their existence. But you'll find anchor Casey (Peter
Krause) and producer Dana (Felicity Huffman) finding out maybe they
really are soul mates; the return of Isaac (Robert Guillaume) from
his stroke (written into the plot because of Guillaume's real-life
illness); and the usual emotional roller coaster of sentimentality
and sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Sports Night'' bows out for the season, you realize just
how well cast this show is. If Huffman doesn't win an Emmy _ hands
down _ something's terribly wrong in Hollywood. Krause and Josh
Charles, who plays his co-host on the show, have a natural
chemistry while being vastly different characters. Two of the
show's supporting cast _ Sabrina Lloyd as Natalie and Joshua Malina
as Jeremy _ are standouts.
</P>
<P>
   One of the experimental and ingenious elements of ``Sports
Night'' is that it's all done in 22 minutes. It would certainly
merit an hour _ and we'd all be better off for it. But juggling the
disparate emotions of the show is part of the trick that brings us
back each week.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the finale, which manages to mix Dana's anal retentive
control habits (funny) with her emotional collapse (sad), and
Casey's paternal breakthrough with his son (touching) with his
inability to express his true emotions to Dana (frustrating), is
virtuoso stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But Sorkin and company have been doing this all season. That
some people want to quibble with one of the few TV shows that
actually stretches out and exposes itself while taking chances is
the worst kind of quibbling.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't seen ``Sports Night,'' or catch it only
occasionally, watch the finale. It will make you long for reruns so
you can play catch-up, and it will place you in the same emotional
state as the diehards: anxious, circling September on the calendar,
waiting to go back on air.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes out is nothing. Four months will be unbearable.

NEW BUG STILL HAS BUYERS WAITING MONTHS FOR DELIVERY
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: Accompanied by NEW BEETLE-BUYER) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSIE MILLIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kirsten Green wanted Volkswagen's New Beetle so badly that she
dreamt of the car regularly. A shiny yellow Bug drove around her
nighttime subconscious so often that she mentioned the dreams to
her husband, who secretly ordered her the car.
</P>
<P>
   She discovered his plans. The Arlington, Texas, couple built a
carport in anticipation of their new arrival. They waited for
months. She had more Bug dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Michael Green brought Kirsten to Fort Worth's Autobahn
Motor Group. There sat her yellow dream car with a big bow on it
and a sign ``Reserved for Kirsten Green.''
</P>
<P>
   She burst into tears.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen of America calls its New Beetle ``probably the most
emotional car in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   More so than a Jaguar? A Porsche?
</P>
<P>
   At $16,000 to $20,000, it's a more affordable emotion, one that
maneuvers easily through our memories of fun times in a fun car.
</P>
<P>
   Even for those born after 1979, the last model year for the
original Beetle, the New Beetle fuels an emotional response to its
happy, shiny colors, rounded silhouette and flower-bud vase on the
dash (the flower sometimes twirls when the air conditioner is on
full blast).
</P>
<P>
   Even now, about one year after the model was introduced in March
1998, dealers say New Beetle buyers still are waiting from one
month to more than a year for delivery, depending on the options
requested.
</P>
<P>
   Want a standard transmission, maybe a black or a white car? The
wait is not long.
</P>
<P>
   Want the most popular colors, yellow or silver? With automatic
transmission, a sunroof and leather interior? You have time to
build the carport.
</P>
<P>
   The waiting lists aren't expected to go away. In Arlington, 60
people are on the Hiley Volkswagen waiting list for the New Beetle;
at Autobahn in Fort Worth, 75 are cooling their heels. Even test
drives are difficult to come by _ Autobahn Motorcar used to keep a
New Beetle on the lot for that purpose, but it proved too popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like Six Flags here,'' Chris Pipes, New Beetle salesman
at Autobahn Motorcar Group, said of the amusement-ride atmosphere
that accompanied the test car.
</P>
<P>
   The '90s Bug was never meant to be a massive seller, and the
company has no plans to step up production. It was meant to draw
attention to the entire line of VWs, accelerating interest in the
company that also wants to sell a lot of Golfs and Jettas.
</P>
<P>
   It appears to be working.
</P>
<P>
   Autobahn is planning a mid-June opening of a 31,769-square-foot,
$1 million expansion of showroom space and service bays for VWs as
well as Porsches. And new models of the New Beetle are likely to
keep interest charged _ the New Beetle BLX model with a
turbo-powered diesel engine and a speed-deployed ``spoiler'' went
on sale in late April. The convertible model is expected by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   All this hoopla does not create an emotional response in
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another new car,'' said Kelly Huffman, 29, owner of
Arlington's The Bug Stop, a repair and parts shop for the original
Beetle, those built between 1949 and 1979. ``The old ones really
look like the people's car.''
</P>
<P>
   Huffman keeps a mailing list of 15,000 registered owners of
original Beetles in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The New Beetle is a Bug body on the same chassis as the VW Golf
or Jetta. Unlike the original, the engine is water-cooled and in
the front. Six stereo speakers are standard. The glove box is
``silicone-dampered'' to prevent noisy clattering. The bud vase is
there at the request of the chairman of VW's North American region,
who recalled the ceramic vases installed in the luxury models of
European Volkswagens in the 1950s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the fun stuff, the New Beetle also is earning high marks
for safety and handling, leading Motor Trend magazine to name it
its import car of the year for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just cute. When you buy a car and make the first
couple of payments, cute won't cut it,'' Pipes said.
</P>
<P>
   But cute doesn't hurt, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other drivers smile and wave. They give me the peace sign,''
said Kirsten Green. She's age 32, so she never drove the original
Beetle, but when she first saw the new one, she knew it would drive
her out of what she calls her staid, white, four-door sedan world.
``It turns heads.''

   KOSOVO-CAMP _ KUKES, Albania _ Their refugees have hot meals and
electricity in every tent. Their field hospital soon will boast a
full-scale operating theater. Now the managers of the so-called
``Arab camp'' are finishing an airstrip that could receive the
first C-130 loaded with their supplies as early as Tuesday, and
will be improved enough within weeks to serve as a forward base for
NATO war planes. They are relative newcomers to the world of
big-time international humanitarian aid, but the United Arab
Emirates are building a show-stopper. (Kunstel, Cox News Service).

   KOSOVO-TROOPSQ&AMP;A _RINAS AIR FIELD, Albania _ Fear is part of

combat troops here won't talk about -- least of all with us
``pukes'' from the media. Staff Sergeant Kevin Boldin of the 1st
Armored Division(CQ) is an exception. At 29, Boldin has been there
and done it. So he doesn't mind opening up about what war anxiety
is like when you are young. (Albright, Cox News Service). 20. WITH

<P>
   SCI-YOUNG-KILLERS (Undated) _ In the wake of the shootings at
Columbine High School, psychiatrists say it is the fragile children
_ not sturdy ones _ who are most likely to ``break'' in dramatic
ways, according to a growing number of ``psychological autopsy''
studies of youthful suicides, and from less formal studies of
adolescents who have committed murders. At the same time, other
studies have shown that the turbulence, pathology and confusion
considered ``normal'' in adolescence are in fact far from typical.
By Erica Goode.

the AM budget.)

<P>
   SCI-HEART-FAILURE (Undated) _ The severe condition known as
congestive heart failure today is the only form of heart disease
that is on the rise in the United States. In a way, the epidemic of
congestive heart failure is good news, evidence of the progress
that has been made in saving the lives of heart attack victims and
people with other heart problems alive. About 4.9 million Americans
have heart failure, and an estimated million of them are under the
age of 60. Every year, 400,000 new cases are diagnosed, and the
condition leads to more than 800,000 hospital stays, including many
repeat visits. Congestive heart failure is the leading cause of
hospitalization in the elderly, and hospital bills accounted for
much of the $18.8 billion spent on the disease in 1998. Health
experts say the problem is getting worse. By Denise Grady. (2675

   SCI-AGING-SHUTTLES (Cape Canaveral, Fla.) _ America's aging
space shuttles, often criticized as monuments to 1970s technology,
are slowly being replaced by much more modern spacecraft _
themselves. Since the first one flew in 1981, the shuttles have
been steadily modified during their lifetimes, NASA engineers and
managers say, and are much more modern beneath their familiar skin
than most people realize. By Warren E. Leary. (1400 words)

<P>
   SCI-TURTLES-ASIA (Undated) _ One of the world's great centers of
turtle and tortoise diversity, Southeast Asia has long teemed with
species found nowhere else in the world. But in recent years,
researchers say, this biological treasure trove has been converted
into a gold mine for profiteers who have been gathering every
turtle in sight for sale as food and medicinals in the turtle
markets of neighboring China. By Carol Kaesuk Yoon. (1700 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MAKING-BOMBS (Undated) _ The carnage at Littleton reportedly
caused in part by the explosion of homemade bombs highlighted the
ease of making such devices from common, easily obtainable
materials. Many lethal recipes from ``The Anarchist's Cookbook''
originally published in the 1960s, and from other public sources,
have been broadcast electronically for years, available to anyone
with a computer and access to the Internet. An essay by Malcolm W.
Browne.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-RIVER-RESCUE (Undated) _ The San Pedro River is in danger of
drying up because groundwater pumping for urban development and
farms is drawing water from the river on both sides of the
U.S.-Mexico border. Saving this ``extraordinary biological treasure
chest,'' as an international panel of experts recently called the
river habitat, has become a test case for a cooperative effort
under the NAFTA to save an ecosystem shared by the two countries.

   SCI-STEERE-LYME (Boston) _ A Scientist-at-Work profile: Dr.
Allen Steere has been studying Lyme disease for 24 years, longer
than anyone else. He was the first to identify the ailment among a
baffling cluster of kids with swollen knees in Lyme, Conn. Over the
protests of civic leaders he gave the disease the town's name. He
led research efforts on the vaccine, then came under fire for his
theory that some people with Lyme disease suffer a post-disease
syndrome, which has prompted some insurance companies to cease
coverage. By David France. (1580 words)

   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: By the
time most compulsive gamblers seek help, they are hugely in debt,
owing anywhere from $38,000 to $120,000 and sometimes more, and
their families are a shambles. About 80 percent of problem gamblers
seriously consider suicide and 13 percent to 20 percent attempt
suicide or succeed. More than 5 million Americans are pathological
or problem gamblers, and another 15 million are at risk of falling
into the same morass, according to a study reported last month by
the National Gambling Impact Study Commission. By Jane E. Brody.

suffering from age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause
of severe vision loss in the elderly. By Andrew Pollack. (800
words)
</P>

   SCI-DOCTORS-BUSINESS (Undated) _ More and more physicians find
they are unable to deal with the complexities of today's medical
business and are returning to school to complete MBA's or enrolling
in dual business programs during medical school. By Adam Nagourney.
(1025 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FITNESS-CYCLO-CROSS (Undated) _ Cyclo-cross, a combination
of mountain biking and steeplechasing, is catching on among fitness
advocates. Participants ride laps over a narrow loop that is filled
with technical challenges like logs, sand pits, mud puddles, and
man-made obstacles. The courses travel over soggy meadows, stream
beds, and dirt trails; no more than half the distance may traverse
paved road. Riders often hop off their bikes, sling them over their
shoulders, and sprint over unbikable terrain on foot. By Liz
Neporent. (500 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ Short items on health and fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pro and con: Is sunlight exposure the best means of achieving
optimal body levels of vitamin D? (200 word each side).
</P>
<P>
   _ At altitudes above 8,000 feet, people need to consume double
the water they would at sea level, yet a survey of 126 hikers on a
popular 14.5-mile trail elevated over 10,000 feet found that only 1
percent carried a sufficient water load, a half liter per hour of
walking, according to a recent study. (300 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Most parents of toddlers and preschoolers try to be careful
about what they serve their children to avoid choking. But a report
presented last week at a meeting of the American Society of
Pediatric Otolaryngology warned that meals served to young children
outside the home may present an even greater choking risk.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BLOOD-PRESSURE (Undated) _ People with high blood pressure
often fail to respond to medication, leading their doctors to
prescribe more and more pills for them. Instead, doctors should
help them remember to take the pills they already have, an
international expert in blood pressure control said last week. By
Abigail Zuger, M.D. (550 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Science questions answered: Why do so many
teen-agers have trouble waking up in the morning? Is there any way
to train yourself to make getting up at 7 a.m. easier? Morning
sleepiness may have a cause as simple as lack of sleep. The
solution may be to cut down on some sleep-robbing activities and
gradually change bedtime and waking time in 15-minute increments
until the person wakes refreshed at a desirable time. (300 words)

NEW CEO TOUTS FUTURE OF SOFTWARE MAKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CUPERTINO, Calif. _ John W. Thompson, the new chief executive of
Symantec Corp. was hitting his conference table with the flat of
his hand, his voice rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not be a poster boy. I will not. I will NOT. I WILL
NOT!''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson drove home the point that he refuses to become, in his
words, ``the poster boy for African-Americans in Silicon Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering these sentiments, the announcement of Thompson's
appointment to run the Silicon Valley's seventh largest software
maker couldn't have come at a worse time.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before Symantec announced Thompson's appointment last
month, the Rev. Jesse Jackson had barnstormed through Silicon
Valley, announcing that his civil rights organization was going to
concentrate and publicizing the Silicon Valley's ``digital divide''
_ what Jackson sees as the exclusion of minorities from the revved
up high-tech economy.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who had spent the last 28 years climbing through IBM's
executive ranks, soon found himself being asked for comment on
Jackson's initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse Jackson's presence in the Valley had not a thing to do
with my appointment,'' said Thompson, a graduate of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``It had nothing to do with
the color of my skin.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a sentiment echoed by Carl Carman, a Symantec director
based in Boulder, Colo. ``We hired him because of his strong
background in software sales and marketing, and for his incredible
leadership abilities. Not because of his ethnic background.''
</P>
<P>
   And considering Thompson's take on the alleged ``divide,''
Jackson may want to reconsider enlisting his help.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an industry that's fueled on the intellectual capital
of the people it can hire,'' said Thompson, 50. ``Considering that,
I can't imagine this industry being exclusionary in any way.
That's, well, that's just idiotic.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who 28 years ago stood out in the early blue-suited
sales army at IBM (``I had a large mustache and even larger afro'')
believes that the lack of minorities in Silicon Valley industries
stems from the small number of minorities graduating with math and
science degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the fundamental reason that needs to be investigated,''
Thompson said. ``I don't think it has something to do with industry
leadership supposedly biased against African-Americans or
Hispanics.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he would focus on pushing Symantec into the
future. He hinted during an interview that his strategy includes a
consolidation of Symantec's software publishing efforts, currently
spread out over a number of best-selling software titles, including
Norton Utilities and anti-virus software. But some brands, such as
its pcCommute, have been weak performers, and anti-virus software
publisher Network Associates has been spending heavily to promote
itself as an alternative to Symantec's products.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we sit where we are, we'll be a tombstone,'' Thompson said.
``The expectations of me, with a supportive board, is to now take
the company somewhere different.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he might concentrate some of those future efforts
on embedded computer chips and handheld personal computers, a
growing market segment ignored by the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll find out over the next few weeks and months what our
plans are,'' Thompson said. ``We're going to pick some things to
concentrate on, areas that I want us to dominate.''
</P>
<P>
   The new chief executive inherits a fairly healthy company, in
financial terms. Last Thursday, Symantec reported earnings of 44
cents per share for its fourth quarter ending April 2. The report
exceeded expectations. The company earned $25 million (before
one-time charges) on $175.6 million in sales for the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In its third quarter, Symantec earned $24 million on $156.1
million in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's announced strategies are already drawing praise from
industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Symantec has a great brand name and some key products,'' said
Alex Cutler, a New York analyst who's followed Symantec for a
number of years. ``Now one of the challenges they face is to tie it
all together in a comprehensive message.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what Thompson's heritage was at IBM, and Symantec is
very lucky to have him on board at this point in time.''

 &HT;    FROM UPSCALE TO DOWN-HOME, SOUTHERN COOKING ABOUNDS IN CAPITAL
 &HT;    With SOUTHERN-FOOD-LIST. Moving in (t) travel and (d) food
categories for release Sunday, May 9.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ George Strait's picture is on the wall and his
voice is on the jukebox. A plaster of Paris catfish hangs from the
skylight and gospel singers make a joyful noise during Sunday
brunch. But it's the skillet cornbread that draws transplanted
Southerners to the Music City Roadhouse in trendy Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   The Roadhouse is among an assortment of restaurants in and
around the nation's capital that cater to expatriates of Dixie.
These folks crave the victuals they were reared on and savor the
memories resurrected by heaping helpings of collards, fried green
tomatoes and sweet potato pie.
</P>
<P>
   People are what they eat _ culturally as well as nutritionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food is absolutely the backbone of culture,'' explained
William Ferris, chairman of the National Endowment for the
Humanities and former director of the Center for the Study of
Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every region, every ethnic group resonates to food,'' he said.
``Foods really are symbolic _ making you remember not only the
eating but also the family conversations and bonding at the dinner
table.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ferris, a political appointee who recalls his rural
upbringing when he sips buttermilk, the nostalgia of down-home
cooking is hardly a dispassionate intellectual pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss my grits and bacon and fried chicken and fried okra,
sweet potatoes, collard greens and cornbread. That's who I am.
That's what I grew up with. And I like to be at a table with that
cuisine,'' said Ferris. His favorite restaurant in the world is
Smitty's, on the town square in Oxford, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of his first tasks upon moving to Washington was to
plant a backyard garden of field peas, okra, squash, bell peppers,
cucumbers and tomatoes. But Ferris said the state of Southern
cooking ``is in pretty good condition'' in his new home.
</P>
<P>
   With a considerable portion of its populace made up of African
Americans with roots in the South, the District of Columbia has a
culinary heritage of ``soul food.'' Heavy on fried pork chops, fish
and chicken and well-cooked, pork-flavored vegetables, these
comforting meals have graced the tables of both black and white
Southerners for generations.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional dishes of Virginia, located just across the
Potomac River, have also historically been a savory part of the
District diet.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's cuisine ``used to be more Southern,'' said Phyllis
C. Richman, who grew up in the District and has been food critic of
the Washington Post for the past 22 years. ``Now Southern food is
like foreign food _ trendy food _ rather than indigenous food. But
there is still a Southern influence. Even the Washington Post
cafeteria offers grits for breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than half a century, the Florida Avenue Grill has been
the epicurean epicenter for authentic Southern cooking in the
capital city. The walls are covered with pictures of celebrities
who have eaten the cornbread, fried chicken, and red beans and rice
over the decades. There are testimonials from Strom Thurmond,
Denzel Washington, the Four Tops, Clarence Thomas, Janet Reno, Lena
Horne, Kris Kross, a dozen or so Washington Redskins and scores of
other distinguished diners.
</P>
<P>
   The homey restaurant is a must-stop for District politicians.
Former Mayor Marion Barry smiles down from the gallery of pictures.
New Mayor Anthony A. Williams ate a breakfast of fried eggs, grits,
sausage and biscuits at the Florida Avenue Grill on the morning
after his election.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who like this kind of food if you
season it right, but it's not for the dietitian,'' said owner Lacey
Wilson, who bought the business from his father in 1969. ``My
father was originally from North Carolina. He opened the restaurant
in 1944. The menu is from the South.''
</P>
<P>
   So is the menu at Georgia Brown's _ albeit vaguely. One of
several upscale, nouvelle Southern restaurants to open in the
District in the past decade, Georgia Brown's features the
low-country dishes from the coastal region between Savannah, Ga.,
and Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put a twist on some of the old classic dishes,'' said Neal
Langermann, the executive chef and a partner in the six-year-old
venture. Black-eyed peas are mashed into a cake, for instance, and
grits are loaded with shrimp, shallots, sausage and scallions.
</P>
<P>
   However, the innovation of crisp, undercooked collards met with
patron resistance. Tradition prevailed after Washington superlawyer
Vernon Jordan, a son of the South who knows his greens, advised the
chefs to cook the collards longer.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Brown's food is prepared in an open kitchen as diners
sit beneath a ceiling sculpture of flowing metal strips that is
reminiscent of the spreading limbs of a live oak.
</P>
<P>
   Some purists chafe at the versions of down-home food served at
Georgia Brown's and the similarly upscale Vidalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's somebody's take on Southern cuisine, but it's not the
food I grew up on,'' said Jody Powell, a native of Vienna, Ga., who
came to town more than 20 years ago as President Carter's press
secretary and is now chairman of the Powell Tate public relations
firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can pretty much find that kind of food, but it takes a
little effort,'' he said. ``Fresh vegetables. Greens. Butter beans.
Field peas. It's hard to find butter beans at the right stage.
People up here are used to eating limas that are hard and big. Good
butter beans need to be cooked when they're small and tender. The
same thing is true with boiled peanuts. The peanuts need to be
pulled up when still young. I've given up trying to find them. When
I go home, I get some and bring them back.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell said he bought a place on the Eastern Shore of the
Chesapeake Bay to be in farm country ``when the vegetables start
coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do miss homemade jellies and preserves. That hot pepper
sauce you put on greens. Pear relish,'' he said. ``You'd think with
all this tasteless Yankee food, I would have lost some weight, but
I haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   Another uprooted Southerner who cooks his own roots food is Rep.
Billy Tauzin, R-La. His craving is for crawfish.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get them fresh on the waterfront marina,'' he said.
``RT's, (with restaurants) both in Alexandria and Arlington (Va.),
has the most authentic Cajun cooking in the area.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tauzin, who is writing a book on Cajun recipes and history,
regularly has a cousin bring up staples from the bayou so he can
cook gumbo, jambalaya, milk-fed pig and other traditional Louisiana
dishes for political fund-raisers and other gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always keep some in the freezer for when I want something
good to eat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are also a couple of Washington-area restaurant chains
that cater to Southern tastes. Red, Hot and Blue _ whose founders
include the late political strategist Lee Atwater, a South Carolina
native _ features barbecue, including dry-cooked Memphis-style
ribs. The Black-Eyed Pea provides Washington's version of ``meat
and three'' vegetables, plus cornbread and biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   Young staffers for members of Congress from Southern states
swell the clientele of the Music City Roadhouse, said manager Steve
Briggs. Located beside the C&AMP;O Canal in Georgetown, the roomy,
rollicking restaurant features a bar and pool tables downstairs and
several rooms of tables upstairs. Meals are served family style _
serving dishes set on the table so diners can help themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The menu is Southern standard: fried chicken, fried catfish,
country fried steak, barbecued spare ribs, pot roast, greens, sweet
potatoes, sliced cucumbers in vinegar. Cornbread is hot from the
skillet.
</P>
<P>
   The walls are covered with pictures of country music stars and
Elvis posters. There's live gospel music during brunch every
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Richman, the restaurant critic, said her home town could
probably use some more places that feature the tastes of the South.
With an Arkansan occupying the White House and the next
presidential election shaping as a contest between a Tennesseean
and a Texan, it doesn't seem there will be a shortage of hungry
Southerners any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, I like that kind of food,'' said Richman.

 &HT;    FROM UPSCALE TO DOWN-HOME, SOUTHERN COOKING ABOUNDS IN CAPITAL
 &HT;    With SOUTHERN-FOOD-LIST. Moving in (t) travel and (d) food

   WASHINGTON _ George Strait's picture is on the wall and his
voice is on the jukebox. A plaster of Paris catfish hangs from the
skylight and gospel singers make a joyful noise during Sunday
brunch. But it's the skillet cornbread that draws transplanted
Southerners to the Music City Roadhouse in trendy Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   The Roadhouse is among an assortment of restaurants in and
around the nation's capital that cater to expatriates of Dixie.
These folks crave the victuals they were reared on and savor the
memories resurrected by heaping helpings of collards, fried green
tomatoes and sweet potato pie.
</P>
<P>
   People are what they eat _ culturally as well as nutritionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food is absolutely the backbone of culture,'' explained
William Ferris, chairman of the National Endowment for the
Humanities and former director of the Center for the Study of
Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every region, every ethnic group resonates to food,'' he said.
``Foods really are symbolic _ making you remember not only the
eating but also the family conversations and bonding at the dinner
table.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ferris, a political appointee who recalls his rural
upbringing when he sips buttermilk, the nostalgia of down-home
cooking is hardly a dispassionate intellectual pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss my grits and bacon and fried chicken and fried okra,
sweet potatoes, collard greens and cornbread. That's who I am.
That's what I grew up with. And I like to be at a table with that
cuisine,'' said Ferris. His favorite restaurant in the world is
Smitty's, on the town square in Oxford, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of his first tasks upon moving to Washington was to
plant a backyard garden of field peas, okra, squash, bell peppers,
cucumbers and tomatoes. But Ferris said the state of Southern

<P>
   Remember, they are always watching you. Use cash when you can.
Do not give your phone number, Social Security number or address,
unless you absolutely have to. Do not fill in questionnaires or
respond to telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   Demand that credit and data-marketing firms produce all
information they have on you, correct errors and remove you from
marketing lists. Check your medical records often. If you suspect a
government agency has a file on you, demand to see it.
</P>
<P>
   Block caller ID on your phone, and keep your number unlisted.
Never use electronic toll booths on roads. Never leave your mobile
phone on _ your movements can be traced. Do not use store credit or
discount cards.
</P>
<P>
   If you must use the Internet, encrypt your e-mail, reject all
``cookies'' and never give your real name when registering at web
sites. Better still, use somebody else's computer.
</P>
<P>
   At work, assume that calls, voice mail, e-mail and computer use
are all monitored...
</P>
<P>
   This sounds like the paranoid ravings of the Unabomber. In fact,
it is advice being offered by the more zealous of today's privacy
campaigners.
</P>
<P>
   In an increasingly wired world, people are continually creating
information about themselves that is recorded and often sold or
pooled with information from other sources.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of privacy advocates is not extreme. Anyone who took
these precautions would merely be seeking a level of privacy
available to all 20 years ago. And yet such behavior now would seem
obsessive and paranoid indeed.
</P>
<P>
   That is a clue to how fast things have changed. To try to
restore the privacy that was universal in the 1970s is to chase a
chimera. Computer technology is developing so rapidly that it is
hard to predict how it will be applied.
</P>
<P>
   But some trends are unmistakable. The volume of data recorded
about people will continue to expand dramatically. Disputes about
privacy will become more bitter. Attempts to restrain the
surveillance society through new laws will intensify.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers will pay more for services that offer a privacy
pledge. And the market for privacy-protection technology will grow.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here is a bold prediction: all these efforts to hold back
the rising tide of electronic intrusion into privacy will fail.
</P>
<P>
   They may offer a brief respite for those determined, whatever
the trouble or cost, to protect themselves. But 20 years hence most
people will find that the privacy they take for granted today will
be just as elusive as the privacy of the 1970s now seems.
</P>
<P>
   Some will shrug and say: ``Who cares? I have nothing to hide.''
But many others will be disturbed by the idea that most of their
behavior leaves a permanent and easily traceable record.
</P>
<P>
   People will have to start assuming that they simply have no
privacy. This will constitute one of the greatest social changes of
modern times.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy is doomed for the same reason that it has been eroded so
fast over the past two decades. Presented with the prospect of its
loss, many might prefer to eschew even the huge benefits that the
new information economy promises. But they will not, in practice,
be offered that choice.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, each benefit _ safer streets, cheaper communications,
more entertainment, better government services, more convenient
shopping, a wider selection of products _ will seem worth the
surrender of a bit more personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy is a residual value, hard to define or protect in the
abstract. The cumulative effect of these bargains _ each attractive
on their own _ will be the end of privacy.

   The European Union's data protection directive, the most
sweeping recent attempt, gives individuals unprecedented control
over information about themselves. This could provide remedies
against the most egregious intrusions. But it is doubtful whether
the law can be applied in practice, if too many people try to use
it.
</P>
<P>
   Already the Europeans are hinting that they will not enforce the
strict terms of the directive against America, which has less
stringent protections. &QL;

   Policing the proliferating number of databases and the thriving
trade in information would not only be costly in itself; it would
also impose huge burdens on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, such laws are based on a novel concept: that
individuals have a property right in information about themselves.
Broadly enforced, such a property right would be antithetical to an
open society.
</P>
<P>
   It would pose a threat not only to commerce, but also to a free
press and to much political activity, to say nothing of everyday
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   It is more likely that laws will be used not to obstruct the
recording and collection of information, but to catch those who use
it to do harm.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the same technology that is destroying privacy also
makes it easier to trap stalkers, detect fraud, prosecute criminals
and hold the government to account. The result could be less
privacy, certainly _ but also more security for the law-abiding.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever new legal remedies emerge, opting out of
information-gathering is bound to become ever harder and less
attractive. If most urban streets are monitored by intelligent
video cameras that can identify criminals, who will want to live on
a street without one?
</P>
<P>
   If most people carry their entire medical history on a plastic
card that the emergency services come to rely on, a refusal to
carry the card could be life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   To get a foretaste of what is to come, try renting a car or
booking a room at a top hotel without a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the future may be like the past, when few except the
rich enjoyed much privacy. To earlier generations, escaping the
claustrophobic all-knowingness of a village for the relative
anonymity of the city was one of the more liberating aspects of
modern life.
</P>
<P>
   But the era of urban anonymity already looks like a mere
historical interlude. There is, however, one difference between
past and future. In the village, everybody knew everybody else's
business. In the future, nobody will know for certain who knows
what about them.
</P>
<P>
   That will be uncomfortable. But the best advice may be: get used
to it. &QL;

   Remember, they are always watching you. Use cash when you can.
Do not give your phone number, Social Security number or address,
unless you absolutely have to. Do not fill in questionnaires or
respond to telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   Demand that credit and data-marketing firms produce all
information they have on you, correct errors and remove you from
marketing lists. Check your medical records often. If you suspect a
government agency has a file on you, demand to see it.
</P>
<P>
   Block caller ID on your phone, and keep your number unlisted.
Never use electronic toll booths on roads. Never leave your mobile
phone on _ your movements can be traced. Do not use store credit or
discount cards.
</P>
<P>
   If you must use the Internet, encrypt your e-mail, reject all
``cookies'' and never give your real name when registering at web
sites. Better still, use somebody else's computer.
</P>
<P>
   At work, assume that calls, voice mail, e-mail and computer use
are all monitored...
</P>
<P>
   This sounds like the paranoid ravings of the Unabomber. In fact,
it is advice being offered by the more zealous of today's privacy
campaigners.
</P>
<P>
   In an increasingly wired world, people are continually creating
information about themselves that is recorded and often sold or
pooled with information from other sources.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of privacy advocates is not extreme. Anyone who took
these precautions would merely be seeking a level of privacy
available to all 20 years ago. And yet such behavior now would seem
obsessive and paranoid indeed.
</P>
<P>
   That is a clue to how fast things have changed. To try to
restore the privacy that was universal in the 1970s is to chase a
chimera. Computer technology is developing so rapidly that it is
hard to predict how it will be applied.
</P>
<P>
   But some trends are unmistakable. The volume of data recorded
about people will continue to expand dramatically. Disputes about
privacy will become more bitter. Attempts to restrain the
surveillance society through new laws will intensify.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers will pay more for services that offer a privacy
pledge. And the market for privacy-protection technology will grow.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here is a bold prediction: all these efforts to hold back
the rising tide of electronic intrusion into privacy will fail.
</P>
<P>
   They may offer a brief respite for those determined, whatever
the trouble or cost, to protect themselves. But 20 years hence most
people will find that the privacy they take for granted today will
be just as elusive as the privacy of the 1970s now seems.
</P>
<P>
   Some will shrug and say: ``Who cares? I have nothing to hide.''
But many others will be disturbed by the idea that most of their
behavior leaves a permanent and easily traceable record.
</P>
<P>
   People will have to start assuming that they simply have no
privacy. This will constitute one of the greatest social changes of
modern times.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy is doomed for the same reason that it has been eroded so
fast over the past two decades. Presented with the prospect of its
loss, many might prefer to eschew even the huge benefits that the
new information economy promises. But they will not, in practice,
be offered that choice.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, each benefit _ safer streets, cheaper communications,
more entertainment, better government services, more convenient
shopping, a wider selection of products _ will seem worth the
surrender of a bit more personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy is a residual value, hard to define or protect in the
abstract. The cumulative effect of these bargains _ each attractive
on their own _ will be the end of privacy.

laws will fail _ as they have done in the past. &QL;

WHAT'S MISSING FROM THE `GREAT BOOKS' LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Like the lists that came before it, the Modern
Library's list of the 100 best English-language works of non
fiction this century begs for argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Cold Blood'' at No. 96? No Cornelius Ryan? No ``Let Us Now
Praise Famous Men''? ``The Education of Henry Adams'' _ read by
only a handful outside the walls of academe _ rated No. 1? A raft
of obscure works nudging better-known and better-loved books off
the list? It doesn't make much sense.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than hem and haw over the list, how about just
throwing together another list, one that splits time between
nonfiction classics and odd, backwater books that have never lost
their ability to bring a smile or a raised eyebrow?
</P>
<P>
   How about a quick list of 50, easily found in most libraries or
yard sales or in the sale bin at used book stores, and well worth a
read?
</P>
<P>
   The Modern Library panel, in trying to rectify the mistakes of
its fiction list, insisted no nonfiction writer be given more than
one title and added two women, a black author and two younger
writers to its judges.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, though, came up with a list that feels pressed-in and
ponderous, heavy on academic reading and light on the more
enjoyable nonfiction books of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best writing of the century came in English travel
books between the wars, but the Modern Library list offers no
titles. This list does. Only one sports book _ ``The Sweet
Science'' by A.J. Liebling _ is included by the Modern Library.
This list corrects that.
</P>
<P>
   The Modern Library spurns movies, music, the best-written books
from World War II and Vietnam, and biographies in general.
</P>
<P>
   This list doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   It had no chance of making the Modern Library list, but surely
there is a place in the best English-language nonfiction books of
the century for Daniel Taylor's ``Spiritua America.'' The former
railroad man and war veteran, writing through University Publishers
in Los Angeles in 1974, uses the English language in a way that
continues to surprise and delight.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of books like that on this list, using the
English language in a way that brings a chuckle and wheeze and
sometimes a catch in the throat _ lacking, perhaps, in the pure
information offered by the Modern Library, but making up for it in
song and wallow.
</P>
<P>
   Additions to the list of the 100 best works of English-language
nonfiction in the 20th century, in no particular order:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, James Agee and Walker Evans.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``The Army of the Potomac,'' Bruce Catton.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``A Bridge Too Far,'' Cornelius Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   4. ``Hot Countries,'' Alec Waugh.
</P>
<P>
   5. ``The Summer Game,'' Roger Angell.
</P>
<P>
   6. ``Dispatches,'' Michael Herr.
</P>
<P>
   7. ``Brave Men,'' Ernie Pyle.
</P>
<P>
   8. ``By-Line: Ernest Hemingway.''
</P>
<P>
   9. ``The Shadow of Blooming Grove,'' Francis Russell.
</P>
<P>
   10. ``Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72,'' Hunter S.
Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   11. ``We Played the Game,'' edited by Danny Peary.
</P>
<P>
   12. ``Mystery Train,'' Greil Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   13. ``The First Day on the Somme,'' Martin Middlebrook.
</P>
<P>
   14. ``Here Lies Eric Ambler,'' by Eric Ambler.
</P>
<P>
   15. ``Muhammad Ali,'' Wilfred Sheed.
</P>
<P>
   16. ``Barbarossa,'' Alan Clark.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time there was a parliament in Scotland, Louis XIV was
on the throne of France and George Washington had not yet been
born.
</P>
<P>
   On May 6 Scotland's voters will elect the first parliament to
sit in Edinburgh for almost 300 years. At the same time the Welsh
will be voting for the first elected national assembly in their
history.
</P>
<P>
   These developments do not signal the rebirth of Scotland and
Wales as independent countries. But they do signal an historic _
and welcome _ shift in the way Britain is governed.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to sketch out post-devolution scenarios that are both
pessimistic and plausible. The most common is that a Scottish
Parliament will simply prove a way station on the road to Scottish
independence and the breakup of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Another frequently touted idea is that there will be an English
nationalist backlash against the new powers for a Scottish
Parliament _ as the English come to resent the continuing Scottish
presence at Westminster, and the higher level of government
spending in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   And do not neglect Wales in this gloommongers' guide.
</P>
<P>
   The Welsh voted to set up an assembly only by the narrowest of
margins; and it will not have the legislative or tax-raising powers
of the Scottish Parliament. So the Welsh Assembly can easily be
envisaged as a white elephant in the making.
</P>
<P>
   All of these things may come to pass. But, encouragingly, they
are looking increasingly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing inherently wrong with the idea of Scottish
independence. But many Englishmen would regret the breakup of
Britain, and the most recent polls suggest that a majority of Scots
also reject the idea.
</P>
<P>
   As for the much anticipated ``English backlash,'' it has made
good journalistic copy, but there is precious little evidence of it
in reality. Rather, the English seem to be reacting to the coming
of the Scottish Parliament in an admirably relaxed fashion.
</P>
<P>
   And Wales? An energetic, if peculiar, election campaign suggests
that the assembly may yet catch the popular imagination.
</P>
<P>
   So while it is only realistic to acknowledge that devolution
could ``go wrong,'' the reality is that the new parliaments in
Scotland and Wales are more likely to invigorate Britain than
enfeeble it.
</P>
<P>
   In different ways, the English, the Scots, the Welsh and the
British as a whole stand to benefit from devolution.
</P>
<P>
   Take the English first. They will gain if the new parliament in
Edinburgh eases the political tensions created by an alienated
Scotland. If Scots have more control over their own affairs, they
are less likely to agitate against ``rule from London.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists who see a Scottish parliament as a dangerous
change to a system which has delivered Britain centuries of peace
and stability are missing the point.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Britain has been enviably stable. But that is because it
has been governed pragmatically, by politicians prepared to adapt
the system in response to popular pressures _ for example in the
series of reform acts, which widened the franchise and ushered in
mass democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Setting up a Scottish parliament is squarely in this tradition
of judicious adjustment to popular pressure.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the English should welcome a decentralization of
power that may help to invigorate peripheral parts of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably no coincidence that Britain's golden age in the
19th century was also a period of powerful provincial cities.
</P>
<P>
   But this century, and particularly the past 20 years, has seen
an unhealthy concentration of political, cultural and economic
power around London and the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   The palpable sense of new confidence in Edinburgh and the
rebuilding of Cardiff _ both linked to devolution _ are good for
Britain, and may also provide a model for the revival of some
English provincial cities.
</P>
<P>
   Devolution will not, however, be the answer to every Scottish
prayer. The Scots will have to face some difficult questions.
</P>
<P>
   If, as many Scots believe, their education system is markedly
superior to that of the English, why are so many Scottish children
leaving school without qualifications?
</P>
<P>
   Are Scots really more public-spirited than the English, and if
so are they prepared to pay higher taxes? Facing up to these issues
will introduce a welcome new realism into Scottish politics, and
should weaken the ``blame the English'' culture.
</P>
<P>
   Wales's challenge is rather different. The first task facing an
assembly in Cardiff will simply be to overcome the ingrained
skepticism of many Welsh voters about the assembly's utility.
</P>
<P>
   That has been made all the harder by Tony Blair's decision to
prevent the Welsh Labour Party from opting for a leader who showed
dangerous signs of being capable of independent thought.
</P>
<P>
   But even the relatively toothless Welsh Assembly will have the
power to scrutinize and alter the administration of Wales, and so
give its people a greater sense of participation in their own
government.
</P>
<P>
   If it does that job well, the Welsh may opt to give their
assembly Scottish-style powers over taxation and primary
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   These benefits for the Scots, the Welsh and the English will add
up to a general benefit for Britain as a whole. If devolution works
it will suggest that Britain's traditional gift for creating
political stability through moderation and pragmatism still exists.
</P>
<P>
   And if gloomy predictions of ``the breakup of Britain'' prove to
be ill-founded, the notion of Britishness could well emerge
strengthened by a proven ability to accommodate diverse national
cultures and new centers of power. &QL;

   What does America owe the Kosovars now? At a minimum, a bit of
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   On April 22, Vice-President Al Gore announced that America would
bring as many as 20,000 Kosovar refugees to America. Most of them
will probably wind up in Detroit, New York and Los Angeles, where
they can join sizeable Albanian-American communities.
</P>
<P>
   America is also planning to look after another 20,000 Kosovars
in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a meaningful contribution,'' says an administration
official, ``which indicates to Macedonia and our allies that we're
making a commitment to burden-sharing.''
</P>
<P>
   It will also say something about how America sees its
obligations to the people on whose behalf it is dropping bombs but
not sending troops.
</P>
<P>
   The White House's first plan was to put those 20,000 Kosovars in
a naval base at Guantanamo Bay, in Cuba. ``It was ready made,
already on the shelf,'' says an administration official.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Kosovars would not be in America proper, they would
not be able to make asylum claims that would let them stay. The
administration was told it was being callous, and the White House
quickly reversed itself.
</P>
<P>
   America took the lead on military action against Yugoslavia, but
is not yet as bold in taking in refugees.
</P>
<P>
   True, its new promise to take 20,000 Kosovars is matched only by
Turkey; but so far Germany has already taken in 10,000 of these
unhappy people, and Turkey 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Against the total of 78,000 refugees from around the world that
America was already planning to take in this year, 20,000 Kosovars
is a modest figure. And against a total of displaced and refugee
Kosovars reckoned at around 925,000 people, the American number is
tiny.
</P>
<P>
   The country's refugee policy has always been deeply politicized.
The people who have the best chance of getting a new life in
America are those who have made common cause with America against a
foreign foe, and are suffering for it.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, this has usually meant being against communism. If
the Kosovars now get truly generous treatment, the change will be
plain. The common foe will not be communism; it will be Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic's brand of ethnic hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Which refugees has America preferred? During the Cold War,
American policy catered chiefly to refugees from communist
countries. According to a 1953 law, anyone from a communist or
communist-dominated country in Europe had an automatic claim to be
a refugee.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until 1980 that a new law rubbed out any reference to
communism in America's definition of a refugee.
</P>
<P>
   The old definition was good news for Soviet Jews and dissidents,
Vietnamese, and Cubans; it has been less good for those fleeing
from right-wing Latin American dictatorships, or small and poor
countries forgotten in geopolitical rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   There is another, subtler pattern, often obscured when it
overlaps with anti-communism. America has a habit of opening its
borders as a gesture of shame and responsibility after a foreign
debacle.
</P>
<P>
   When the Soviet Union crushed Hungary's uprising in 1956, a
flood of desperate Hungarians poured into Western Europe.
Distressed by America's inability to rescue Hungary, President
Dwight Eisenhower used a new immigration law to allow 38,000 of
them to come to America.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam was the next big responsibility case. When America lost
the war there, the problem was not just South Vietnamese soldiers
and officials who would now be exposed to the wrath of the
victorious communists. Large numbers of ordinary Vietnamese wanted
out, too.
</P>
<P>
   So, from 1975 to 1980, America let in almost half a million
people from Indochina.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, America's sympathy for Cuban refugees stems at least
in part from American shame over the failure of the Bay of Pigs
invasion in 1961. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 650) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the most striking Cold-War responsibility story is that of
the Hmong.
</P>
<P>
   Until the war in Indochina, the Hmong were a small, isolated
community of farmers living in the highlands of Vietnam, Cambodia
and Laos. But during the war the CIA recruited the Hmong to fight
against the Vietnamese and Laotian communists.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, the triumphant communists turned on the Hmong, many of
whom fled to refugee camps in Thailand. America then took the Hmong
in, with communities growing in California and Minnesota, where
Lutheran church groups tried to help out.
</P>
<P>
   There are now about 180,000 Hmong in America, roughly a third of
them clustered in Minneapolis and St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
   The transition has been wrenching. Trying to leap from a peasant
society to industrial America, many Hmong ended up in poverty or on
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   And conservative Minnesotans have tended to look askance at
Hmong traditions such as polygamy and animal sacrifice. But, for
all the difficulties, the principle of sheltering the Hmong is a
decent one. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under President Bill Clinton, there has been an effort to change
the emphasis. Now the push is more towards straight
humanitarianism, says Alexander Aleinikoff, who was general counsel
for the Immigration and Naturalization Service under Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But old habits die hard. The State Department's list of
countries singled out for priority for refugees still has a strong
whiff of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   America favors human-rights-minded Cubans, Jews and evangelical
Christians in the former Soviet Union, Iranian religious
minorities, and Vietnamese who spent more than three years in
detention camps because of their pre-1975 ties to America or the
defunct South Vietnamese regime.
</P>
<P>
   This year, America will run special refugee services in Havana,
Ho Chi Minh City and Moscow, so that people in those places can
start the process of becoming refugees without actually leaving
their countries.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of true post-Cold-War priorities does show in
three newish categories: Burmese democrats, some Africans, and
survivors of ``ethnic cleansing'' in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years American refugee policy has largely avoided
the old blend of shame and responsibility, being replaced instead
by fear of numbers. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the first few years after the Gulf War, America took in only
about 4,000 Iraqi refugees a year.
</P>
<P>
   From 1992 to 1995, when Milosevic brought war to Bosnia, America
took in only about 19,000 refugees from Bosnia, plus 12,000 in
1996, after the American-sponsored Dayton accords. (By the autumn
of 1996, by contrast, there were 320,000 Bosnian refugees in
Germany.)
</P>
<P>
   The treatment of Haitian refugees, intercepted at sea and then
shunted off to Guantanamo, showed the new American anxiety,
reinforced in that case by the fact that the refugees were both
poor and black. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM; STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovars are not likely to end up like the Hungarians or the
Vietnamese, let alone the Hmong.
</P>
<P>
   Is Kosovar refugee policy driven by a sense of guilt that NATO
has so far refused to send in ground troops? A White House official
bristles at the suggestion: ``The administration does not feel
responsible for the ethnic cleansing that's taking place.''
</P>
<P>
   Others sound gloomier, admitting that, if the Kosovar refugees
cannot ultimately find a way home, America may owe them a real
debt.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official says, ``It is logical to assume that,
given that we've taken 20,000, if we can't get them all home,
there'll be a sense of burden.'' &QL;

SAN FRANCISCO BUSINESSES WANT TO CUT CASH BENEFITS FOR POOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY LEWIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Some businesses here are backing a ballot
measure that would reduce cash benefits for recipients of San
Francisco's General Assistance program for the needy. Supporters of
the measure say they want to keep poor people from spending welfare
checks on drugs and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to give the welfare recipients only 15 percent of
their benefits in cash, while the remaining 85 percent would go for
services such as housing, addiction treatment and job training.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Council and a group of 40 business owners and
merchants have rallied behind former City Human Services
commissioner Earl Rynerson, who is lobbying Mayor Willie Brown and
the Board of Supervisors to place the measure on the November
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   People on General Assistance who are not in a welfare work
program receive $287 per month. Rynerson, who wants that cut to $43
a month, said ``we want to ensure the money (the city is) spending
is not being spent on drugs and alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea drew a terse response from Steve Williams of People
Organized to Win Employee Rights (POWER): ``It's a stupid proposal.
All they're trying to do is control people's money. The problem is
not how poor people spend their money. The problem is poor people
don't have enough services.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not enough affordable housing, substance abuse
treatment or permanent job opportunities that provide a living wage
for poor people,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Rynerson countered that San Francisco's network of services is
``second to none ... and on top of the services, we provide a cash
service. We have a responsibility to see that every needy
individual receives the services they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown has not seen a final version of the proposed ballot
measure and has yet to say whether he would support putting it on
the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor is always concerned that GA dollars are put to
appropriate use,'' said Brown spokeswoman Kandace Bender.
</P>
<P>
   The merchants supporting the initiative say they're motivated by
concern about how homelessness affects their ability to carry on
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've formed an organization to help Rynerson with his
initiative,'' said David Heller of the Greater Geary Merchants
Association, who was chosen by the merchant groups and business
owners to head an organization they call San Franciscans for
Responsible Homeless Policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city actually spends more than $60 million on the
homeless,'' Heller said. ``You still have to shelter them, you have
hospital costs. It's costing us more money. No (other) city in the
United States gives out the kind of cash we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rynerson said if he and his colleagues failed to persuade city
officials to place the measure on the ballot, he would go the
traditional route to qualify an initiative by gathering at least
10,500 signatures.

CHARLTON HESTON'S SCRIPT AND TIMING HAVE GONE AWRY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Even the best actor can occasionally fluff his lines. But some
fluffs so distract an audience that it loses the plot.
</P>
<P>
   Has Charlton Heston (not one of the greatest actors, but a good
one nonetheless) committed such a gaffe?
</P>
<P>
   ``If there had been even one armed guard in the school,'' Heston
announced the day after teenage gunmen killed a dozen fellow
students, one teacher and finally themselves in a Littleton, Colo.,
high school, ``he could have saved a lot of lives and perhaps ended
the whole thing instantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually no. There was indeed an armed guard at Columbine
High School, he exchanged gunfire with the teenagers _ and he
failed to prevent the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious conclusion is that Heston's script, or at least his
sense of timing, has gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   But is it equally obvious that the play is ruined, and that
Heston is doomed to lasting embarrassment after presiding over this
past weekend's annual meeting of the National Rifle Association
(which, by bitter irony, was held in Denver)?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the risk was there: the NRA resisted the plea of
Denver's mayor to cancel the event, but shortened it from three
days to one ``to show our profound sympathy and respect for the
families and communities in the Denver area in their time of great
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, making the accident of the calendar still riskier for
the NRA were the days of televised mourning that preceded it:
heartbreaking funeral scenes and countless hours of electronic
punditry.
</P>
<P>
   Tragedy in Colorado hits home in a way that tragedy in Kosovo
does not. Yet, sadly for those Americans dismayed by their
society's addiction to guns, the risk to the NRA's standing is
probably less than it appears.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that in the land of attention-deficit disorder the
media cannot sustain its focus for long.
</P>
<P>
   Horrendous acts of schoolboy violence, for example, are regular
occurrences, but they fade all too quickly from public memory (the
killings by Littleton's ``Trench-Coat Mafia'' were the seventh such
incident to have captured the TV cameras in the past 18 months).
</P>
<P>
   The bigger reason, however, is that Heston's script, for all his
recent mistakes of timing and delivery, is one that cannot be
dismissed out of hand. Instead, it has to be listened to when the
actor is on form.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, Heston's speech (just four days before the
Littleton killings) to the students at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   To their parents, Heston is an American icon, somehow embodying
the heroism of his roles of yesteryear: Ben Hur in his Roman
chariot; Moses bearing aloft God's Ten Commandments; El Cid defying
the Moorish hordes.
</P>
<P>
   Today's students are too young to be influenced by such epics
(though some will remember Heston's cameo appearance as the boss of
the CIA, intimidating Arnold Schwarzenegger in ``True Lies'').
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they see simply an old man, further over the hill than
Clint Eastwood (a mere 68, compared with 74-year-old Heston) and
with a ridiculously poor toupee.
</P>
<P>
   But when they listen, they hear one of America's most inspiring
voices, awakening all the atavistic longing, felt even by the
young, for a simpler, better nation: Here I am still in the
chariot... The thought police do not frighten me. I hope I frighten
them... I believe that in your heart you already know something is
profoundly wrong. When bartenders are responsible for drunk
drivers' acts, and gunmakers are responsible for criminals' acts,
and nobody is responsible for O.J. Simpson's acts, something is
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Lest this version of ``truth and consequences'' seem a trifle
too rabidly right-wing, Heston reminds his audience that he once
marched with Martin Luther King (his critics say his civil-rights
activism has grown in the telling).
</P>
<P>
   And, lest it seem a trifle simplistic, he reminds them that
``passing laws is what keeps politicians' careers alive. Enforcing
laws is what keeps you alive.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a shrewd mantra, intoned to discredit even the most modest
attempts to restrict Americans' access to weapons of personal
destruction. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (350-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 700) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remember President Bill Clinton's 1994 crime bill stopping the
transfer of handguns by adults to juveniles? ``His Justice
Department bothered to prosecute only five people in 1997 and six
in 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   Or the ban on semiautomatic guns? Just four prosecutions in 1997
and four in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Or ``that media love-child, the Brady Bill?'' Just nine people
convicted out of the quarter-million felons who attempted to buy
handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Look, by contrast, at the NRA way: the imposition of punitive
federal law for firearms offenses and the right (available now in
31 states) to carry a concealed weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The result, say some scholars to the NRA's delight, is both
lower crime and better economics (Sterling Burnett of the National
Center for Policy Analysis impressively calculates that the
deterrent effect of ``defensive gun use'' confers a net benefit
ranging between $1 billion and $38.8 billion a year).
</P>
<P>
   Say all this enough times and the audience will doubtless forget
the distraction of Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   When 53 percent of adults polled _ after Littleton _ by CBS
oppose a ban on the sale of handguns to civilians, this week's call
by the Washington Post for just such a ban looks, sadly, like
wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   So too, alas, does the incrementalist approach of that other
American actor, Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in what the Senate Republican leader Trent Lott
dismissed as a ``typical knee-jerk reaction'' to Littleton, the
president proposed legislation requiring child-proof locks on all
guns sold; background checks on people buying from private dealers
at gun shows; a lifetime ban on owning guns for violent juveniles;
a three-day waiting period for all handgun purchases, with the
minimum buyer age raised from 18 to 21; a ban on the possession by
juveniles of semiautomatic assault rifles; and a limit (as in
Virginia) on handgun sales to one per person per month.
</P>
<P>
   Can such puny measures really be what the White House calls
``the most comprehensive gun legislation in 30 years?''
Unfortunately, yes. But, as Clinton pointed out, guns are part of
America's culture and cultural change comes hard. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM; STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heston's NRA straddles two streams of the nation's
consciousness: the huntin' and fishin' of America's idyllic past
and rural present, and the ``Dirty Harry'' violence of its inner
cities.
</P>
<P>
   What a pity the combination is so durable _ and so deadly. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Even the best actor can occasionally fluff his lines. But some
fluffs so distract an audience that it loses the plot.
</P>
<P>
   Has Charlton Heston (not one of the greatest actors, but a good
one nonetheless) committed such a gaffe?
</P>
<P>
   ``If there had been even one armed guard in the school,'' Heston
announced the day after teenage gunmen killed a dozen fellow
students, one teacher and finally themselves in a Littleton, Colo.,
high school, ``he could have saved a lot of lives and perhaps ended
the whole thing instantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually no. There was indeed an armed guard at Columbine
High School, he exchanged gunfire with the teenagers _ and he
failed to prevent the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious conclusion is that Heston's script, or at least his
sense of timing, has gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   But is it equally obvious that the play is ruined, and that
Heston is doomed to lasting embarrassment after presiding over this
past weekend's annual meeting of the National Rifle Association
(which, by bitter irony, was held in Denver)?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the risk was there: the NRA resisted the plea of
Denver's mayor to cancel the event, but shortened it from three
days to one ``to show our profound sympathy and respect for the
families and communities in the Denver area in their time of great
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, making the accident of the calendar still riskier for
the NRA were the days of televised mourning that preceded it:
heartbreaking funeral scenes and countless hours of electronic
punditry.
</P>
<P>
   Tragedy in Colorado hits home in a way that tragedy in Kosovo
does not. Yet, sadly for those Americans dismayed by their
society's addiction to guns, the risk to the NRA's standing is
probably less than it appears.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that in the land of attention-deficit disorder the
media cannot sustain its focus for long.
</P>
<P>
   Horrendous acts of schoolboy violence, for example, are regular
occurrences, but they fade all too quickly from public memory (the
killings by Littleton's ``Trench-Coat Mafia'' were the seventh such
incident to have captured the TV cameras in the past 18 months).
</P>
<P>
   The bigger reason, however, is that Heston's script, for all his
recent mistakes of timing and delivery, is one that cannot be
dismissed out of hand. Instead, it has to be listened to when the
actor is on form.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, Heston's speech (just four days before the
Littleton killings) to the students at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   To their parents, Heston is an American icon, somehow embodying
the heroism of his roles of yesteryear: Ben Hur in his Roman
chariot; Moses bearing aloft God's Ten Commandments; El Cid defying
the Moorish hordes.
</P>
<P>
   Today's students are too young to be influenced by such epics
(though some will remember Heston's cameo appearance as the boss of
the CIA, intimidating Arnold Schwarzenegger in ``True Lies'').
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they see simply an old man, further over the hill than
Clint Eastwood (a mere 68, compared with 74-year-old Heston) and
with a ridiculously poor toupee.
</P>
<P>
   But when they listen, they hear one of America's most inspiring
voices, awakening all the atavistic longing, felt even by the
young, for a simpler, better nation: Here I am still in the
chariot... The thought police do not frighten me. I hope I frighten
them... I believe that in your heart you already know something is
profoundly wrong. When bartenders are responsible for drunk
drivers' acts, and gunmakers are responsible for criminals' acts,
and nobody is responsible for O.J. Simpson's acts, something is
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Lest this version of ``truth and consequences'' seem a trifle
too rabidly right-wing, Heston reminds his audience that he once
marched with Martin Luther King (his critics say his civil-rights
activism has grown in the telling).
</P>
<P>
   And, lest it seem a trifle simplistic, he reminds them that
``passing laws is what keeps politicians' careers alive. Enforcing
laws is what keeps you alive.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a shrewd mantra, intoned to discredit even the most modest
attempts to restrict Americans' access to weapons of personal
destruction. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; (350-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 700) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remember President Bill Clinton's 1994 crime bill stopping the
transfer of handguns by adults to juveniles? ``His Justice
Department bothered to prosecute only five people in 1997 and six
in 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   Or the ban on semiautomatic guns? Just four prosecutions in 1997
and four in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Or ``that media love-child, the Brady Bill?'' Just nine people
convicted out of the quarter-million felons who attempted to buy
handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Look, by contrast, at the NRA way: the imposition of punitive
federal law for firearms offenses and the right (available now in
31 states) to carry a concealed weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The result, say some scholars to the NRA's delight, is both
lower crime and better economics (Sterling Burnett of the National
Center for Policy Analysis impressively calculates that the
deterrent effect of ``defensive gun use'' confers a net benefit
ranging between $1 billion and $38.8 billion a year).
</P>
<P>
   Say all this enough times and the audience will doubtless forget
the distraction of Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   When 53 percent of adults polled _ after Littleton _ by CBS
oppose a ban on the sale of handguns to civilians, this week's call
by the Washington Post for just such a ban looks, sadly, like
wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   So too, alas, does the incrementalist approach of that other
American actor, Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in what the Senate Republican leader Trent Lott
dismissed as a ``typical knee-jerk reaction'' to Littleton, the
president proposed legislation requiring child-proof locks on all
guns sold; background checks on people buying from private dealers
at gun shows; a lifetime ban on owning guns for violent juveniles;
a three-day waiting period for all handgun purchases, with the
minimum buyer age raised from 18 to 21; a ban on the possession by
juveniles of semiautomatic assault rifles; and a limit (as in
Virginia) on handgun sales to one per person per month.
</P>
<P>
   Can such puny measures really be what the White House calls
``the most comprehensive gun legislation in 30 years?''
Unfortunately, yes. But, as Clinton pointed out, guns are part of
America's culture and cultural change comes hard. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM; STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heston's NRA straddles two streams of the nation's
consciousness: the huntin' and fishin' of America's idyllic past
and rural present, and the ``Dirty Harry'' violence of its inner
cities.
</P>
<P>
   What a pity the combination is so durable _ and so deadly. &QL;

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 World Rights 
 By T. BERRY BRAZELTON, M.D. and JOSHUA SPARROW, M.D.  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The massacre in Littleton, Colo., is a national tragedy. It is
also a national indictment. It should not be seen as just a high
school tragedy or a breakdown in preventive care for two disturbed
teen-agers. It is an urgent call to our country for help.
</P>
<P>
   The recent episodes of teens and preteens murdering their
classmates have sent a message that our nation is in deep trouble.
We are a violent society. How many more young lives must be lost
before we finally face this?
</P>
<P>
   We are all asking: ``Why did this have to happen?'' We don't
know for sure what drove the two teens in Colorado, but we do know
that there is no other country in the world where anything like
this schoolyard bloodshed has happened so often. It is time we
looked at what sets us apart and whether we are harboring risk
factors here that we must address before tragedy strikes again.
</P>
<P>
   To start, no other country in the industrialized world tolerates
such easy access to guns. We are paying for this with our
children's lives. The overall firearm-related death rate among U.S.
youths is 12 times higher than in 25 other industrialized countries
combined, according to a recent study. For firearm-related
homicides, the rate is 16 times higher. Added now to this menace is
easy access to bomb plans on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had to have been
profoundly disturbed to have done what they did. But if we hadn't
made it so easy for them, maybe they would have started by slashing
tires or throwing bricks through school windows _ and maybe
somebody would have noticed before lives were lost.
</P>
<P>
   Access to violent television and video games has also exacted
its price. As far back as the early '60s, Albert Bandura, a
psychology professor at Stanford University, demonstrated that
after being exposed to violence on television, young children will
spontaneously introduce new aggression into their play. If a child
spends hours shooting a virtual gun at a virtual human target _ the
goal being to splatter virtual brains, intestines and blood on the
screen _ isn't it common sense that at some point the taboo against
this behavior will be eroded?
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Klebold belong to the first generation of children
who grew up from the beginning with such games and with the new
permissiveness for televised violence. If we can't change the
television and toy industries, we certainly can hold ourselves as
parents responsible to know _ and to say no. Do you know what your
own children are watching?
</P>
<P>
   To do their jobs, though, parents need more support than they
are getting. Families today are dealing with more stress than ever
before. Often both parents need to work full-time, and very few
workplaces can be seen as family-friendly. Parents are struggling
to get home in time to discipline, to model values for their
children with their own behavior and to foster self-acceptance in
their children.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that families can't do all of this on their own. When
will we stop clinging to this outdated notion and take some steps
toward helping parents and children?
</P>
<P>
   Without paid parental leave in the first months of a child's
life, most parents cannot afford the ``luxury'' of caring for their
infant at this critical stage when attachment to other human beings
is first set in motion. We can no longer risk depriving children of
this early basis for intimacy and eventually self-esteem. We are
facing the cost of raising children whose sense of self and
connection to others is too tentative to withstand the taunting of
later years.
</P>
<P>
   When parents do notice signs of trouble, they often can't turn
to a professional for help because they lack adequate health
insurance to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   If we are to avert future tragedies, we will have to include
these and other ways of supporting parents in a new definition of
community.
</P>
<P>
   When children reach the school years, they need a community more
than ever. The school day ends at 2 or 3 p.m., leaving several
unsupervised hours every day for children of working parents.
Children need either longer school days or afterschool activities _
in community organizations, church groups or schools _ that
continue until at least 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Klebold and Harris have taught us that children also need a
community to provide them with opportunities for acceptance in as
wide a range of activities as possible, so that they will not have
to seek out acceptance and affirmation in racist hate groups and
cults.
</P>
<P>
   Schools are an integral part of the solution, and we are asking
them to do much more than ever before. Yet we can't expect them to
do it if we don't provide them with the means they need. We must
revive our children's respect for their teachers by demonstrating
our own _ and show that we mean it by providing the funds and
support that teachers deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Our schools can no longer tolerate bullying or hatred based on
differences. Teachers must help children take pride in the
activities in which they excel, channel their creative energies
constructively and find acceptance within themselves and from their
peers.
</P>
<P>
   Schools, like families, are where children learn _ more from
action than from words _ what our society's values are. Do we even
know what these are anymore?
</P>
<P>
   By neglecting our children, our families, our communities, we
are teaching our children that money, power and aggression come
first. If we really have given in to ``every man for himself,''
then this is what our children will learn. We will deserve, more
than they, the human jungle they will inherit.
</P>
<P>
   We must face what has changed in our world, what must change and
what must be preserved. We have known about most of these risk
factors _ and what to do about many of them _ for years. We should
now turn our outrage into a resolve to act. Many of the solutions
are within our reach.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy in Colorado is a call to arms for us all _ not to
the firearms which increasingly are being recognized as one part of
the problem, but to human arms which can envelop the families who
are raising angry, neglected children. We need to respond to this
call to arms with the embrace of community, workplace and society
at large.
</P>
<P>
   We must help families nurture their young safely and
responsively, modeling our altruism, accountability and caring _
before these values are lost.

   The massacre in Littleton, Colo., is a national tragedy. It is
also a national indictment. It should not be seen as just a high
school tragedy or a breakdown in preventive care for two disturbed
teen-agers. It is an urgent call to our country for help.
</P>
<P>
   The recent episodes of teens and preteens murdering their
classmates have sent a message that our nation is in deep trouble.
We are a violent society. How many more young lives must be lost
before we finally face this?
</P>
<P>
   We are all asking: ``Why did this have to happen?'' We don't
know for sure what drove the two teens in Colorado, but we do know
that there is no other country in the world where anything like
this schoolyard bloodshed has happened so often. It is time we
looked at what sets us apart and whether we are harboring risk
factors here that we must address before tragedy strikes again.
</P>
<P>
   To start, no other country in the industrialized world tolerates
such easy access to guns. We are paying for this with our
children's lives. The overall firearm-related death rate among U.S.
youths is 12 times higher than in 25 other industrialized countries
combined, according to a recent study. For firearm-related
homicides, the rate is 16 times higher. Added now to this menace is
easy access to bomb plans on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had to have been
profoundly disturbed to have done what they did. But if we hadn't
made it so easy for them, maybe they would have started by slashing
tires or throwing bricks through school windows _ and maybe
somebody would have noticed before lives were lost.
</P>
<P>
   Access to violent television and video games has also exacted
its price. As far back as the early '60s, Albert Bandura, a
psychology professor at Stanford University, demonstrated that
after being exposed to violence on television, young children will
spontaneously introduce new aggression into their play. If a child
spends hours shooting a virtual gun at a virtual human target _ the
goal being to splatter virtual brains, intestines and blood on the
screen _ isn't it common sense that at some point the taboo against
this behavior will be eroded?
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Klebold belong to the first generation of children
who grew up from the beginning with such games and with the new
permissiveness for televised violence. If we can't change the
television and toy industries, we certainly can hold ourselves as
parents responsible to know _ and to say no. Do you know what your
own children are watching?
</P>
<P>
   To do their jobs, though, parents need more support than they
are getting. Families today are dealing with more stress than ever
before. Often both parents need to work full-time, and very few
workplaces can be seen as family-friendly. Parents are struggling
to get home in time to discipline, to model values for their
children with their own behavior and to foster self-acceptance in
their children.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that families can't do all of this on their own. When
will we stop clinging to this outdated notion and take some steps
toward helping parents and children?
</P>
<P>
   Without paid parental leave in the first months of a child's
life, most parents cannot afford the ``luxury'' of caring for their
infant at this critical stage when attachment to other human beings
is first set in motion. We can no longer risk depriving children of
this early basis for intimacy and eventually self-esteem. We are
facing the cost of raising children whose sense of self and
connection to others is too tentative to withstand the taunting of
later years.
</P>
<P>
   When parents do notice signs of trouble, they often can't turn
to a professional for help because they lack adequate health
insurance to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   If we are to avert future tragedies, we will have to include
these and other ways of supporting parents in a new definition of
community.
</P>
<P>
   When children reach the school years, they need a community more
than ever. The school day ends at 2 or 3 p.m., leaving several
unsupervised hours every day for children of working parents.
Children need either longer school days or afterschool activities _
in community organizations, church groups or schools _ that
continue until at least 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Klebold and Harris have taught us that children also need a
community to provide them with opportunities for acceptance in as
wide a range of activities as possible, so that they will not have
to seek out acceptance and affirmation in racist hate groups and
cults.
</P>
<P>
   Schools are an integral part of the solution, and we are asking
them to do much more than ever before. Yet we can't expect them to
do it if we don't provide them with the means they need. We must
revive our children's respect for their teachers by demonstrating
our own _ and show that we mean it by providing the funds and
support that teachers deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Our schools can no longer tolerate bullying or hatred based on
differences. Teachers must help children take pride in the
activities in which they excel, channel their creative energies
constructively and find acceptance within themselves and from their
peers.
</P>
<P>
   Schools, like families, are where children learn _ more from
action than from words _ what our society's values are. Do we even
know what these are anymore?
</P>
<P>
   By neglecting our children, our families, our communities, we
are teaching our children that money, power and aggression come
first. If we really have given in to ``every man for himself,''
then this is what our children will learn. We will deserve, more
than they, the human jungle they will inherit.
</P>
<P>
   We must face what has changed in our world, what must change and
what must be preserved. We have known about most of these risk
factors _ and what to do about many of them _ for years. We should
now turn our outrage into a resolve to act. Many of the solutions
are within our reach.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy in Colorado is a call to arms for us all _ not to
the firearms which increasingly are being recognized as one part of
the problem, but to human arms which can envelop the families who
are raising angry, neglected children. We need to respond to this
call to arms with the embrace of community, workplace and society
at large.
</P>
<P>
   We must help families nurture their young safely and
responsively, modeling our altruism, accountability and caring _
before these values are lost.

at large.

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 World Rights

<P>
   The massacre in Littleton, Colo., is a national tragedy. It is
also a national indictment. It should not be seen as just a high
school tragedy or a breakdown in preventive care for two disturbed
teen-agers. It is an urgent call to our country for help.
</P>
<P>
   The recent episodes of teens and preteens murdering their
classmates have sent a message that our nation is in deep trouble.
We are a violent society. How many more young lives must be lost
before we finally face this?
</P>
<P>
   We are all asking: ``Why did this have to happen?'' We don't
know for sure what drove the two teens in Colorado, but we do know
that there is no other country in the world where anything like
this schoolyard bloodshed has happened so often. It is time we
looked at what sets us apart and whether we are harboring risk
factors here that we must address before tragedy strikes again.
</P>
<P>
   To start, no other country in the industrialized world tolerates
such easy access to guns. We are paying for this with our
children's lives. The overall firearm-related death rate among U.S.
youths is 12 times higher than in 25 other industrialized countries
combined, according to a recent study. For firearm-related
homcides, the rate is 16 times higher. Added now to this menace is
easy access to bomb plans on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had to have been
profoundly disturbed to have done what they did. But if we hadn't
made it so easy for them, maybe they would have started by slashing
tires or throwing bricks through school windows _ and maybe
somebody would have noticed before lives were lost.
</P>
<P>
   Access to violent television and video games has also exacted
its price. As far back as the early '60s, Albert Bandura, a
psychology professor at Stanford University, demonstrated that
after being exposed to violence on television, young children will
spontaneously introduce new aggression into their play. If a child
spends hours shooting a virtual gun at a virtual human target _ the
goal being to splatter virtual brains, intestines and blood on the
screen _ isn't it common sense that at some point the taboo against
this behavior will be eroded?
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Klebold belong to the first generation of children
who grew up from the beginning with such games and with the new
permissiveness for televised violence. If we can't change the
television and toy industries, we certainly can hold ourselves as
parents responsible to know _ and to say no. Do you know what your
own children are watching?
</P>
<P>
   To do their jobs, though, parents need more support than they
are getting. Families today are dealing with more stress than ever
before. Often both parents need to work full-time, and very few
workplaces can be seen as family-friendly. Parents are struggling
to get home in time to discipline, to model values for their
children with their own behavior and to foster self-acceptance in
their children.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that families can't do all of this on their own. When
will we stop clinging to this outdated notion and take some steps
toward helping parents and children?
</P>
<P>
   Without paid parental leave in the first months of a child's
life, most parents cannot afford the ``luxury'' of caring for their
infant at this critical stage when attachment to other human beings
is first set in motion. We can no longer risk depriving children of
this early basis for intimacy and eventually self-esteem. We are
facing the cost of raising children whose sense of self and
connection to others is too tentative to withstand the taunting of
later years.
</P>
<P>
   When parents do notice signs of trouble, they often can't turn
to a professional for help because they lack adequate health
insurance to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   If we are to avert future tragedies, we will have to include
these and other ways of supporting parents in a new definition of
community.
</P>
<P>
   When children reach the school years, they need a community more
than ever. The school day ends at 2 or 3 p.m., leaving several
unsupervised hours every day for children of working parents.
Children need either longer school days or afterschool activities _
in community organizations, church groups or schools _ that
continue until at least 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Klebold and Harris have taught us that children also need a
community to provide them with opportunities for acceptance in as
wide a range of activities as possible, so that they will not have
to seek out acceptance and affirmation in racist hate groups and
cults.
</P>
<P>
   Schools are an integral part of the solution, and we are asking
them to do much more than ever before. Yet we can't expect them to
do it if we don't provide them with the means they need. We must
revive our children's respect for their teachers by demonstrating
our own _ and show that we mean it by providing the funds and
support that teachers deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Our schools can no longer tolerate bullying or hatred based on
differences. Teachers must help children take pride in the
activities in which they excel, channel their creative energies
constructively and find acceptance within themselves and from their
peers.
</P>
<P>
   Schools, like families, are where children learn _ more from
action than from words _ what our society's values are. Do we even
know what these are anymore?
</P>
<P>
   By neglecting our children, our families, our communities, we
are teaching our children that money, power and aggression come
first. If we really have given in to ``every man for himself,''
then this is what our children will learn. We will deserve, more
than they, the human jungle they will inherit.
</P>
<P>
   We must face what has changed in our world, what must change and
what must be preserved. We have known about most of these risk
factors _ and what to do about many of them _ for years. We should
now turn our outrage into a resolve to act. Many of the solutions

connection to others is too tentative to withstand the taunting of
later years.
</P>
<P>
   When parents do notice signs of trouble, they often can't turn
to a professional for help because they lack adequate health
insurance to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   If we are to avert future tragedies, we will have to include
these and other ways of supporting parents in a new definition of
community.
</P>
<P>
   When children reach the school years, they need a community more
than ever. The school day ends at 2 or 3 p.m., leaving several
unsupervised hours every day for children of working parents.
Children need either longer school days or afterschool activities _
in community organizations, church groups or schools _ that
continue until at least 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Klebold and Harris have taught us that children also need a
community to provide them with opportunities for acceptance in as
wide a range of activities as possible, so that they will not have
to seek out acceptance and affirmation in racist hate groups and
cults.
</P>
<P>
   Schools are an integral part of the solution, and we are asking
them to do much more than ever before. Yet we can't expect them to
do it if we don't provide them with the means they need. We must
revive our children's respect for their teachers by demonstrating
our own _ and show that we mean it by providing the funds and
support that teachers deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Our schools can no longer tolerate bullying or hatred based on
differences. Teachers must help children take pride in the
activities in which they excel, channel their creative energies
constructively and find acceptance within themselves and from their
peers.
</P>
<P>
   Schools, like families, are where children learn _ more from
action than from words _ what our society's values are. Do we even
know what these are anymore?
</P>
<P>
   By neglecting our children, our families, our communities, we
are teaching our children that money, power and aggression come
first. If we really have given in to ``every man for himself,''
then this is what our children will learn. We will deserve, more
than they, the human jungle they will inherit.
</P>
<P>
   We must face what has changed in our world, what must change and
what must be preserved. We have known about most of these risk
factors _ and what to do about many of them _ for years. We should
now turn our outrage into a resolve to act. Many of the solutions
are within our reach.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy in Colorado is a call to arms for us all _ not to
the firearms which increasingly are being recognized as one part of
the problem, but to human arms which can envelop the families who
are raising angry, neglected children. We need to respond to this
call to arms with the embrace of community, workplace and society
at large.
</P>
<P>
   We must help families nurture their young safely and
responsively, modeling our altruism, accountability and caring _
before these values are lost.

LABOR-MANAGEMENT CLASHES MAY GROUND AIRLINES AS PROFITS CONTINUE TO
SOAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN REED 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Things are tough all over _ at least for
airline executives who are responsible for maintaining working
relationships with their unions.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is still hovering near the peak of its best profits
ever. Not surprisingly, workers industrywide are clamoring for a
larger _ and, they believe, fairer _ share of the profits. And many
workers are doing much more than just clamoring.
</P>
<P>
   At all but a few carriers, labor has quickly moved to _ and
sometimes beyond _ the saber-rattling stage. American Airlines, for
example, piled up millions of dollars in losses after a pilots
sickout in February.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some industry experts and long-term observers believe
the U.S. airline industry, which has never been known for peaceful
labor relations, has perhaps entered the most contentious
environment ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my 20 years of doing this, this is the most difficult
period of labor management negotiations and relations I've ever
seen,'' said Jerrold Glass, Washington-based labor relations
consultant to airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, George Hopkins, a Western Illinois University history
professor and author of two books on pilots unions, agrees that
``there is something new in this current and soon-upcoming spate of
labor negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been raw feelings between management and labor in
the airline industry many, many times,'' Hopkins said. ``I can't
really tell you all the reasons why, but it does seem there's more
of that now than at any time in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   A quick review of recent disputes at major airlines tends to
bear that out.
</P>
<P>
   _In September, the Air Line Pilots Association conducted a
15-day strike against Northwest Airlines. Northwest lost more than
$400 million because of the strike and is still struggling to win
back alienated passengers.
</P>
<P>
   _In February, members of the Allied Pilots Association conducted
a sickout against American Airlines that forced the company to
cancel 6,700 flights and cost it about $225 million. Ostensibly,
the dispute was over American's plans for integrating the pilots of
the recently acquired Reno Air into American's corps. However, it
was the latest hostility to erupt between the pilots and
management, after a brief strike in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   _A few weeks after the pilots sickout, a flight attendants
strike at America West was averted at the last moment when
management capitulated to union demands rather than lose even more
money because of a job action.
</P>
<P>
   _Last month, Delta Air Lines' management canceled delivery of
four Boeing 777s after Air Line Pilots Association leaders opened
talks on pay rates for pilots flying the aircraft by demanding a
pay rate 47 percent higher than what American pays its 777 pilots.
</P>
<P>
   _And just last week, Alaska Airlines, whose operations were
sporadically disrupted during the last two years in mini-strikes by
its flight attendants, had to cancel about 10 percent of its
flights because of what management described as a slowdown by
mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only carriers not caught up in or headed for a
significant labor dispute are United, Southwest and Continental.
United's parent, UAL Corp., is 52 percent owned by United
employees. And Southwest and Continental have their unions locked
into long-term contracts, with the exception of Continental's
flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, at least 15 major union contracts are already up for
re-negotiation, or will come up for re-negotiation during the next
15 months.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and industry experts say it's not hard to figure the
reasons behind the gathering labor storm in the airline industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``With 1999 being the sixth consecutive year of strong earnings,
it is not surprising at all that airline labor is demanding its
piece of the profit pie,'' said Julius Maldutis at CIBC
Oppenheimer, the dean of Wall Street's airline analysts. ``The
central theme in the industry over the next two years or so is
going to be trying to find a way to achieve labor peace. And that's
just going to be difficult to do.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, how airline managements handle labor's demands will
be a key variable in how markets value airline securities,'' said
Maldutis, who two weeks ago downgraded his rating on Delta shares
to a ``hold'' because of ``the uncertainty surrounding labor
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the big profits, the current state of airline labor
relations is also a natural outcome of the transformation that
began 21 years ago with the Airline Deregulation Act, said Hopkins,
who generally sides with labor.
</P>
<P>
   The Railway Labor Act of 1926, which governs airline labor
relations, was passed during a ``very conservative era, dominated
by people like Calvin Coolidge and Warren Harding,'' Hopkins said.
``They were worried about the impact on the economy of strikes by
the transportation unions. So the Railway Labor Act makes it very,
very difficult for transportation unions to strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, on balance it has worked out very well for the unions
because their contracts never expire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means companies can't replace workers very easily. So
when a contract opens up for re-negotiation, the workers can keep
their jobs and use all sorts of methods to bring economic pressure
on the companies. Eventually, it becomes more cost-effective for
managements to cut a deal giving the unions most of what they want
than it is to continue suffering the losses caused by union members
withdrawing their enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why the transportation union members are the
highest-paid union members in America relative to what they could
earn with their same set of skills in other industries,'' Hopkins
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress deregulated the airline industry, fostering
aggressive competition and a new imperative to control spending, it
didn't alter the Railway Labor Act, he added.
</P>
<P>
   And because labor is one of the few areas of costs that
management can exercise some control over, a period of intense
labor-management conflict became inevitable. All that was needed,
Hopkins said, was for the industry to remain significantly
profitable long enough for all the union's contracts to come up for
renegotiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a labor regulatory environment designed to work in
a regulated environment now being applied in a very profitable,
deregulated environment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding matters, Hopkins added, is the high level of
distrust that has built up between management and labor as airlines
scrambled to rein in their high costs in the post-deregulation era
and unions fretted about both job security issues and retaining
their relatively high pay and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Glass, who openly sides with airline managements, agreed that
dynamics of the competitive and labor regulatory regimes are
pushing both sides toward confrontation more than ever before. And
the industry's own growth and success, he said, are exacerbating
the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very large number of employees in this industry have never
been through a down cycle or a furlough period like the airlines
typically see,'' Glass said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That last downturn in the early 1990s was the worst ever in
terms of financial losses. But it wasn't the worst downturn in
terms of its impact on jobs lost. Plus, a lot of people now in the
industry, especially those on the ground operations side of the
business, have been hired since 1992 and simply don't understand
how bad things can get in a downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managements have to negotiate contracts with one eye on the
next downturn,'' he said. ``But many workers' expectations are so
unrealistic. They did their givebacks or gave concessions in the
early 1990s and everybody wants their big paybacks now. There's no
patience. The idea seems to be to get it all now while the getting
is good because nobody knows when the next downturn is coming.''

   Mammograms reveal lumps in breasts, but only a painful biopsy
can prove if a lump is benign or cancerous. Now, however, a new
device can help women avoid the need for many biopsies.
</P>
<P>
   Approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration last week,
the T-Scan 2000 from TransScan Medical of Ramsey, N.J., detects
tumors by passing a tiny electric current through the body and
measuring the differences in resistance between normal and tumor
tissue.
</P>
<P>
   The results of a mammogram _ a low-dose X-ray _ are often
difficult to interpret. To be safe, doctors perform biopsies,
removing tissue from the breast to see if it is cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   Every year in the United States, 25 million women have
mammograms and about 800,000 have biopsies after results reveal
suspect tissue. But only 180,000 actually have breast cancer.
TransScan claims the T-Scan could find 6000 cases of cancer that
would otherwise go undetected, and spare more than 600,000 women
the pain of a biopsy.
</P>
<P>
   The device consists of a hand-held probe that contains a small
matrix of sensing electrodes. This is gently placed on the breast
above the suspect region, and a wire is attached to the patient's
hand to complete the circuit. An alternating current of one volt is
then passed through the body.
</P>
<P>
   Differences in structure between tumor tissue and normal tissue
make tumors about 40 times more conductive than regular tissue. The
probes detect these differences as the device is passed over the
breast and a computer generates an image that can then be
interpreted by a technician.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to use the T-Scan to prove there is no cancer. What
we're saying is: do the biopsy to prove there is disease,'' George
Solomon, chief executive officer of TransScan, said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FDA the T-Scan device has the potential to
reduce the number of negative biopsies, thus saving women worry
about breast lesions that turn out to be noncancerous. It also has
the potential to increase the identification of women who should be
referred for early biopsy.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers are working on related techniques. The
National Institutes of Health near Washington, D.C., is developing
an instrument that maps conductivity variations by passing an
oscillating current through the body in a strong magnetic field,
which creates detectable ultrasonic vibrations.

CHEAPER DRUG COCKTAIL CAN TREAT AFRICAN HIV

<P>
   A century-old drug has emerged as a rare source of optimism in
the face of Africa's rampaging AIDS epidemic. Trials in southern
Africa have shown that hydroxyurea, in combination with an existing
HIV drug, could be a cheap alternative to the expensive drug
cocktails pitted against the virus in the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   In rich countries, many HIV-positive people have ''triple
therapy'' _ drug combinations that inhibit two key viral enzymes,
HIV protease and reverse transcriptase. Thanks to these drugs, many
seriously ill patients have been able to resume normal lives.
</P>
<P>
   But at around $12,000 a year, triple therapy is beyond African
budgets.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the continent most affected by HIV, this is pie in the
sky,'' says Steve Miller, who runs a private HIV clinic in
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting organized by the Research Institute for Genetic and
Human Therapy in Washington, D.C., Miller and another southern
African research group last week showed that there is a more
affordable alternative _ the combination of a low dose of ddI,
which inhibits reverse transcriptase, and hydroxyurea, which is
sometimes used to treat leukemia and sickle-cell anemia.
</P>
<P>
   Hydroxyurea has been investigated as a possible AIDS treatment
for several years. Unlike existing drugs, it does not inhibit
specific viral enzymes. Instead, it slows down the synthesis of
nucleic acids and also blocks the activation of the CD4 white blood
cells in which the virus replicates.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has tested the drug combination on 127 AIDS patients,
both men and women. In 68 percent of them, levels of HIV in their
blood became undetectable within 24 weeks, and stayed that way.
Levels of CD4 cells rose significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was with some scepticism I started this experiment,''
Miller says. ''But I think this regimen gave very satisfactory
results.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana Dickinson, who runs an AIDS clinic in Gaborone, Botswana,
has tested the double drug combination on 150 patients. ''The
results were remarkable,'' she says. ''Most of my patients were
extremely ill and unable to work. But after treatment most of them
were working again.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson's patients had to pay for their own blood tests, and
not all of them could afford to do so. But of the 98 who were
tested, nearly 70 percent had levels of HIV below the threshold
detectable by basic assay equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Per head, the annual health care budget in Botswana is about
$1600. A year's supply of the new treatment costs $1200, of which
$1100 is the cost of the ddI.
</P>
<P>
   Although this is a tenth of the cost of triple therapy, it is
still a daunting sum for Botswana. Dickinson now wants Bristol
Myers Squibb, which makes ddI, to cut its prices in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The company could not provide a spokesperson to comment, but has
until now been reluctant to make the drug available more cheaply.
''They haven't lowered their prices because they say it will start
a black market,'' says Dickinson. ''This is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug combination does have side effects. Dickinson saw
reduced production of blood cells in some patients, but this was
serious in only 8 percent of cases. Some of Miller's patients had
darkened skin and nails. ''But overall the side effect profile is
rather good and no worse than one would see with anything else in
treating HIV infection,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, interest in hydroxyurea is also growing in the
developed world. Some AIDS specialists are using it as a
''salvage'' treatment when other drugs have failed.

<P>
   The old wives' tale that a newborn baby will be scared of the
things that frightened its mother during pregnancy may actually be
true _ at least for some lizards.
</P>
<P>
   Newborn Australian skinks react more strongly to their first
whiff of a lizard-eating snake's odor if their mother has smelled
the same snake during pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It certainly surprised the hell out of us,'' says Richard
Shine, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Shine had intended to study how a female lizard's food supply
and basking opportunities affected its offspring. To do this, he
used a small skink, Pseudemoia pagenstecheri, that _ like mammals _
bears live young that have been nourished through a placenta.
</P>
<P>
   Shine happened to have surplus pregnant females. He and graduate
student Sharon Downes decided to expose 20 of them to the odor of a
skink-eating snake by dragging live snakes through their cages
twice weekly.
</P>
<P>
   To their surprise, Shine and Downes found that the offspring of
such females flicked their tongues more and were more likely to
flee when first exposed to snake scent They were also heavier and
had longer tails than those whose mothers had not been exposed to
the scent.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers are not sure what causes these changes. They
could be just an accidental consequence of maternal stress, which
can upset developmental patterns in mammals. Or the mothers could
be priming their offspring by activating genes that are likely to
prove helpful in snake-filled habitats.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows whether these traits actually make the lizards more
likely to evade snakes. Shine hopes to address this question in
experiments later this year.  &QL;

 NEW LCDs RETAIN IMAGE WITHOUT POWER   (This article from the London-based science and technology weekly

<P>
   A liquid crystal display that keeps on showing its last image
even when someone has pulled the plug will eat up less power and
extend the battery life of cell phones, palmtops and laptop
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Where safety is paramount, such as intensive care or aircraft
instruments, a screen that can retain the last display before power
loss would be invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, researchers put the new LCD though its paces at the
Defense Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) in Malvern,
Worcestershire. The LCD saves power by switching itself off after
it has displayed the same image for a preset time. Conventional LCD
screens need a constant power supply, but the new device only draws
power when the screen is updated with new data.
</P>
<P>
   When an electric field is applied to a standard LCD, it changes
the orientation of rod-like molecules in a liquid crystal substance
_ and this in turn changes the polarization of light passing
through them. So each cell, or pixel, can switch from light to dark
_ but only as long as you maintain the appropriate voltage: lose
the power and the image disappears. Such devices are called
monostable LCDs.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier attempts to develop a bistable LCD that hangs onto its
last image have only had limited success, according to Guy
Bryan-Brown, lead researcher in the displays group at DERA. A class
of materials known as ferroelectric LCDs initially looked promising
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue with ferroelectrics is their severe sensitivity to
shock,'' Bryan-Brown says. Unlike standard liquid crystals which
can align their molecules in three dimensions, ferroelectrics are
fluid in two dimensions and crystalline in only one. This means
that when subjected to knocks, ferroelectrics lose their
orientation and consequently any image they are displaying.
</P>
<P>
   DERA's answer is to use a tiny corrugated electrode _ like a
diffraction grating _ to encourage the rod-like molecules to stay
put. The grating aligns the molecules nearest to it in a preferred
direction that depends on both the grating geometry and the applied
voltage. By experimenting with the parameters of the undulating
grating surface, DERA's researchers have made the bistable LCD
shockproof.
</P>
<P>
   ''The liquid crystal wets the grating surface and is in intimate
contact with it, so the molecules never actually leave the grooves
of the corrugations, even when subjected to shock,'' Bryan-Brown
says.
</P>
<P>
   DERA says bistable displays in pagers could eat up to 1000 times
less energy, while cell phone displays could draw up to 100 times
less power. Bryan-Brown says the new LCDs could be made cheaply
using the same foil stamping techniques that already produce
millions of holograms for credit cards. Built into a cash card, the
unpowered LCD could continually display your bank balance, and
could simply be updated by cash machines.  &QL;

   A century-old drug has emerged as a rare source of optimism in
the face of Africa's rampaging AIDS epidemic. Trials in southern
Africa have shown that hydroxyurea, in combination with an existing
HIV drug, could be a cheap alternative to the expensive drug
cocktails pitted against the virus in the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   In rich countries, many HIV-positive people have ''triple
therapy'' _ drug combinations that inhibit two key viral enzymes,
HIV protease and reverse transcriptase. Thanks to these drugs, many
seriously ill patients have been able to resume normal lives.
</P>
<P>
   But at around $12,000 a year, triple therapy is beyond African
budgets.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the continent most affected by HIV, this is pie in the
sky,'' says Steve Miller, who runs a private HIV clinic in
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting organized by the Research Institute for Genetic and
Human Therapy in Washington, D.C., Miller and another southern
African research group last week showed that there is a more
affordable alternative _ the combination of a low dose of ddI,
which inhibits reverse transcriptase, and hydroxyurea, which is
sometimes used to treat leukemia and sickle-cell anemia.
</P>
<P>
   Hydroxyurea has been investigated as a possible AIDS treatment
for several years. Unlike existing drugs, it does not inhibit
specific viral enzymes. Instead, it slows down the synthesis of
nucleic acids and also blocks the activation of the CD4 white blood
cells in which the virus replicates.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has tested the drug combination on 127 AIDS patients,
both men and women. In 68 percent of them, levels of HIV in their
blood became undetectable within 24 weeks, and stayed that way.
Levels of CD4 cells rose significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was with some scepticism I started this experiment,''
Miller says. ''But I think this regimen gave very satisfactory
results.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana Dickinson, who runs an AIDS clinic in Gaborone, Botswana,
has tested the double drug combination on 150 patients. ''The
results were remarkable,'' she says. ''Most of my patients were
extremely ill and unable to work. But after treatment most of them
were working again.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson's patients had to pay for their own blood tests, and
not all of them could afford to do so. But of the 98 who were
tested, nearly 70 percent had levels of HIV below the threshold
detectable by basic assay equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Per head, the annual health care budget in Botswana is about
$1600. A year's supply of the new treatment costs $1200, of which
$1100 is the cost of the ddI.
</P>
<P>
   Although this is a tenth of the cost of triple therapy, it is
still a daunting sum for Botswana. Dickinson now wants Bristol
Myers Squibb, which makes ddI, to cut its prices in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The company could not provide a spokesperson to comment, but has
until now been reluctant to make the drug available more cheaply.
''They haven't lowered their prices because they say it will start
a black market,'' says Dickinson. ''This is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug combination does have side effects. Dickinson saw
reduced production of blood cells in some patients, but this was
serious in only 8 percent of cases. Some of Miller's patients had
darkened skin and nails. ''But overall the side effect profile is
rather good and no worse than one would see with anything else in
treating HIV infection,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, interest in hydroxyurea is also growing in the
developed world. Some AIDS specialists are using it as a
''salvage'' treatment when other drugs have failed.

   Mammograms reveal lumps in breasts, but only a painful biopsy
can prove if a lump is benign or cancerous. Now, however, a new
device can help women avoid the need for many biopsies.
</P>
<P>
   Approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration last week,
the T-Scan 2000 from TransScan Medical of Ramsey, N.J., detects
tumors by passing a tiny electric current through the body and
measuring the differences in resistance between normal and tumor
tissue.
</P>
<P>
   The results of a mammogram _ a low-dose X-ray _ are often
difficult to interpret. To be safe, doctors perform biopsies,
removing tissue from the breast to see if it is cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   Every year in the United States, 25 million women have
mammograms and about 800,000 have biopsies after results reveal
suspect tissue. But only 180,000 actually have breast cancer.
TransScan claims the T-Scan could find 6000 cases of cancer that
would otherwise go undetected, and spare more than 600,000 women
the pain of a biopsy.
</P>
<P>
   The device consists of a hand-held probe that contains a small
matrix of sensing electrodes. This is gently placed on the breast
above the suspect region, and a wire is attached to the patient's
hand to complete the circuit. An alternating current of one volt is
then passed through the body.
</P>
<P>
   Differences in structure between tumor tissue and normal tissue
make tumors about 40 times more conductive than regular tissue. The
probes detect these differences as the device is passed over the
breast and a computer generates an image that can then be
interpreted by a technician.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to use the T-Scan to prove there is no cancer. What
we're saying is: do the biopsy to prove there is disease,'' George
Solomon, chief executive officer of TransScan, said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FDA the T-Scan device has the potential to
reduce the number of negative biopsies, thus saving women worry
about breast lesions that turn out to be noncancerous. It also has
the potential to increase the identification of women who should be
referred for early biopsy.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers are working on related techniques. The
National Institutes of Health near Washington, D.C., is developing
an instrument that maps conductivity variations by passing an
oscillating current through the body in a strong magnetic field,
which creates detectable ultrasonic vibrations.

<P>
   The old wives' tale that a newborn baby will be scared of the
things that frightened its mother during pregnancy may actually be
true _ at least for some lizards.
</P>
<P>
   Newborn Australian skinks react more strongly to their first
whiff of a lizard-eating snake's odor if their mother has smelled
the same snake during pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It certainly surprised the hell out of us,'' says Richard
Shine, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Shine had intended to study how a female lizard's food supply
and basking opportunities affected its offspring. To do this, he
used a small skink, Pseudemoia pagenstecheri, that _ like mammals _
bears live young that have been nourished through a placenta.
</P>
<P>
   Shine happened to have surplus pregnant females. He and graduate
student Sharon Downes decided to expose 20 of them to the odor of a
skink-eating snake by dragging live snakes through their cages
twice weekly.
</P>
<P>
   To their surprise, Shine and Downes found that the offspring of
such females flicked their tongues more and were more likely to
flee when first exposed to snake scent They were also heavier and
had longer tails than those whose mothers had not been exposed to
the scent.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers are not sure what causes these changes. They
could be just an accidental consequence of maternal stress, which
can upset developmental patterns in mammals. Or the mothers could
be priming their offspring by activating genes that are likely to
prove helpful in snake-filled habitats.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows whether these traits actually make the lizards more
likely to evade snakes. Shine hopes to address this question in
experiments later this year.  &QL;

 NEW LCDs RETAIN IMAGE WITHOUT POWER   (This article from the London-based science and technology weekly

<P>
   A liquid crystal display that keeps on showing its last image
even when someone has pulled the plug will eat up less power and
extend the battery life of cell phones, palmtops and laptop
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Where safety is paramount, such as intensive care or aircraft
instruments, a screen that can retain the last display before power
loss would be invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, researchers put the new LCD though its paces at the
Defense Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) in Malvern,
Worcestershire. The LCD saves power by switching itself off after
it has displayed the same image for a preset time. Conventional LCD
screens need a constant power supply, but the new device only draws
power when the screen is updated with new data.
</P>
<P>
   When an electric field is applied to a standard LCD, it changes
the orientation of rod-like molecules in a liquid crystal substance
_ and this in turn changes the polarization of light passing
through them. So each cell, or pixel, can switch from light to dark
_ but only as long as you maintain the appropriate voltage: lose
the power and the image disappears. Such devices are called
monostable LCDs.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier attempts to develop a bistable LCD that hangs onto its
last image have only had limited success, according to Guy
Bryan-Brown, lead researcher in the displays group at DERA. A class
of materials known as ferroelectric LCDs initially looked promising
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue with ferroelectrics is their severe sensitivity to
shock,'' Bryan-Brown says. Unlike standard liquid crystals which
can align their molecules in three dimensions, ferroelectrics are
fluid in two dimensions and crystalline in only one. This means
that when subjected to knocks, ferroelectrics lose their
orientation and consequently any image they are displaying.
</P>
<P>
   DERA's answer is to use a tiny corrugated electrode _ like a
diffraction grating _ to encourage the rod-like molecules to stay
put. The grating aligns the molecules nearest to it in a preferred
direction that depends on both the grating geometry and the applied
voltage. By experimenting with the parameters of the undulating
grating surface, DERA's researchers have made the bistable LCD
shockproof.
</P>
<P>
   ''The liquid crystal wets the grating surface and is in intimate
contact with it, so the molecules never actually leave the grooves
of the corrugations, even when subjected to shock,'' Bryan-Brown
says.
</P>
<P>
   DERA says bistable displays in pagers could eat up to 1000 times
less energy, while cell phone displays could draw up to 100 times
less power. Bryan-Brown says the new LCDs could be made cheaply
using the same foil stamping techniques that already produce
millions of holograms for credit cards. Built into a cash card, the
unpowered LCD could continually display your bank balance, and
could simply be updated by cash machines.  &QL;

SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND SEXUALITY NOT HEALTHY, MINISTER SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Too many pulpits are silent about sex _ especially if it
involves discussions of condoms or abortion, says the Rev. James L.
Demus III. And he is trying to change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to break the silence about human sexuality and
reproductive health in your church,'' Demus told a group of about
30 Fort Worth religious leaders recently. ``If you have 100 members
in your church, you will have 10 or 15 who have sexuality issues
related to abortion, condoms or other matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Demus, pastor of the Park Manor Christian Church in Chicago,
openly discusses even the most controversial of topics in his
500-member congregation. During a sermon on ``Sex and Society,'' he
tossed out condoms from his pulpit to emphasize that such
protection is needed to help prevent sexually transmitted diseases,
such as AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young people thought it was the greatest thing in the
world, but some of the older people were asking, `What's going
on?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Demus addressed a meeting sponsored by Planned Parenthood of
North Texas to launch an effort to enlist local religious
authorities in presenting broad-based information about birth
control, abortion and other subjects related to human sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are establishing a group called Clergy for Responsible
Choices,'' said Michael Comini, executive director of Planned
Parenthood's Tarrant County office. Its goal will be to establish a
forum for faith leaders to discuss birth control and other subjects
related to human sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Many conservative faith groups have begun to offer sex education
materials, but many do not include discussions about condoms or
birth control pills on grounds that it might promote premarital
sex. Also, many of those groups teach that abortion is unbiblical
and immoral.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a popular Southern Baptist program for teen-agers,
called True Love Waits, has young people sign a pledge that they
will refrain from sexual intercourse before marriage. Program
leaders do not discuss contraception, though.
</P>
<P>
   Demus agrees with the biblical ideal of abstinence. But he said
faith groups need to be more realistic and realize that many
unmarried people do not abstain from sex and that decisions on
abortion are very complicated and involve different situations with
each individual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became pro-choice about 10 years ago when a 13-year-old
girl, who was pregnant, came to me asking for advice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pastors, priests and rabbis who present artificial contraception
and abortion as choices for individuals will face much opposition
from anti-abortion conservative Christian leaders, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is dangerous work,'' he said, referring to the violence
that has sometimes erupted at abortion clinics. ``But it's worth
it.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Fort Worth session, Rabbi Ralph Mecklenburger, leader
of Congregation Beth-El, a Reform Jewish congregation, said the
idea of artificial contraception and abortion is not as
controversial as some might think.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of America's population is pro-choice; so are a
majority of Catholics,'' Mecklenburger said. ``The Religious Right,
self-destructively, has hurt its own candidates on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Comini said he hopes religious leaders will work with Planned
Parenthood to sponsor workshops and other programs concerning all
issues surrounding human sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Goddard, founding director of a sex education program that
has been presented to religious groups since the early 1980s,
agrees that the church is too silent on issues of human sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of churches offering sex education is increasing,
though,'' said Goddard, founding director of Christian Life
Enrichment Sources, based in Kingswood, near Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Goddard is best known for weeklong sex education summer camps in
Texas and New Mexico attended by young people who are entering the
ninth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a biblically based program that presents abstinence as
God's ideal,'' she said. ``But we have sessions on birth control,
anatomy, levels of sexual arousal, oral sex, abortion and other
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen Texas congregations, mostly aligned with Christian
Churches (Disciples of Christ,) send teens to the summer camps, she
said. Presbyterians, United Methodists and other mainline Christian
groups also participate.
</P>
<P>
   Goddard, a Presbyterian, believes sexual intimacy is a gift of
God, and that churches, synagogues and mosques are the appropriate
places for information about that gift to be taught.
</P>
<P>
   Demus echoed that thought, and said if faith groups don't teach
about sex, young people will get most of their knowledge about it
from movies and television.

   SCI-YOUNG-KILLERS (Undated) _ In the wake of the shootings at
Columbine High School, psychiatrists say it is the fragile children
_ not sturdy ones _ who are most likely to ``break'' in dramatic
ways, according to a growing number of ``psychological autopsy''
studies of youthful suicides, and from less formal studies of
adolescents who have committed murders. At the same time, other
studies have shown that the turbulence, pathology and confusion
considered ``normal'' in adolescence are in fact far from typical.

   SCI-HEART-FAILURE (Undated) _ The severe condition known as
congestive heart failure today is the only form of heart disease
that is on the rise in the United States. In a way, the epidemic of
congestive heart failure is good news, evidence of the progress
that has been made in saving the lives of heart attack victims and
people with other heart problems alive. About 4.9 million Americans
have heart failure, and an estimated million of them are under the
age of 60. Every year, 400,000 new cases are diagnosed, and the
condition leads to more than 800,000 hospital stays, including many
repeat visits. Congestive heart failure is the leading cause of
hospitalization in the elderly, and hospital bills accounted for
much of the $18.8 billion spent on the disease in 1998. Health
experts say the problem is getting worse. By Denise Grady. (2675

   SCI-AGING-SHUTTLES (Cape Canaveral, Fla.) _ America's aging
space shuttles, often criticized as monuments to 1970s technology,
are slowly being replaced by much more modern spacecraft _
themselves. Since the first one flew in 1981, the shuttles have
been steadily modified during their lifetimes, NASA engineers and
managers say, and are much more modern beneath their familiar skin
than most people realize. By Warren E. Leary. (1400 words)

   SCI-TURTLES-ASIA (Undated) _ One of the world's great centers of
turtle and tortoise diversity, Southeast Asia has long teemed with
species found nowhere else in the world. But in recent years,
researchers say, this biological treasure trove has been converted
into a gold mine for profiteers who have been gathering every
turtle in sight for sale as food and medicinals in the turtle
markets of neighboring China. By Carol Kaesuk Yoon. (1700 words)

   SCI-MAKING-BOMBS (Undated) _ The carnage at Littleton reportedly
caused in part by the explosion of homemade bombs highlighted the
ease of making such devices from common, easily obtainable
materials. Many lethal recipes from ``The Anarchist's Cookbook''
originally published in the 1960s, and from other public sources,
have been broadcast electronically for years, available to anyone

   SCI-RIVER-RESCUE (Undated) _ The San Pedro River is in danger of
drying up because groundwater pumping for urban development and
farms is drawing water from the river on both sides of the
U.S.-Mexico border. Saving this ``extraordinary biological treasure
chest,'' as an international panel of experts recently called the
river habitat, has become a test case for a cooperative effort
under the NAFTA to save an ecosystem shared by the two countries.

   SCI-STEERE-LYME (Boston) _ A Scientist-at-Work profile: Dr.
Allen Steere has been studying Lyme disease for 24 years, longer
than anyone else. He was the first to identify the ailment among a
baffling cluster of kids with swollen knees in Lyme, Conn. Over the
protests of civic leaders he gave the disease the town's name. He
led research efforts on the vaccine, then came under fire for his
theory that some people with Lyme disease suffer a post-disease
syndrome, which has prompted some insurance companies to cease
coverage. By David France. (1580 words)

time most compulsive gamblers seek help, they are hugely in debt,
owing anywhere from $38,000 to $120,000 and sometimes more, and
their families are a shambles. About 80 percent of problem gamblers
seriously consider suicide and 13 percent to 20 percent attempt
suicide or succeed. More than 5 million Americans are pathological
or problem gamblers, and another 15 million are at risk of falling
into the same morass, according to a study reported last month by

   SCI-FITNESS-CYCLO-CROSS (Undated) _ Cyclo-cross, a combination

with technical challenges like logs, sand pits, mud puddles, and
man-made obstacles. The courses travel over soggy meadows, stream

   _ At altitudes above 8,000 feet, people need to consume double

   _ Most parents of toddlers and preschoolers try to be careful

   SCI-BLOOD-PRESSURE (Undated) _ People with high blood pressure
often fail to respond to medication, leading their doctors to
prescribe more and more pills for them. Instead, doctors should
help them remember to take the pills they already have, an
international expert in blood pressure control said last week. By
Abigail Zuger, M.D. (550 words)

<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Science questions answered: Why do so many
teen-agers have trouble waking up in the morning? Is there any way
to train yourself to make getting up at 7 a.m. easier? Morning
sleepiness may have a cause as simple as lack of sleep. The
solution may be to cut down on some sleep-robbing activities and
gradually change bedtime and waking time in 15-minute increments
until the person wakes refreshed at a desirable time. (300 words)

   BRECKENRIDGE AND ODESSA, TEXAS _ In the 1920s, it was hard to
keep people out of Breckenridge. These days, it is harder to get
them to stay.
</P>
<P>
   A town that once boasted the world's most prolific oil
production and was a Mecca for ``wildcatters'' looking for an
instant fortune is now home to only a handful of oil producers
determined to eke out a living on what is left under the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Arnot, a third-generation oil engineer who is one of the
handful, speculates that there is very little future for a town
that depends so heavily on the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a good look around,'' he says. ``Pretty soon this place
is going to look like `The Last Picture Show.'''
</P>
<P>
   In common with hundreds of towns throughout the Texas and
Oklahoma Oil Patch, Breckenridge has been hit hard by a two-year
plunge in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   As cheap foreign oil floods the American market, driving the
price to an all-time low, domestic producers have had to sell their
oil at a price far below what it costs them to operate their wells.
</P>
<P>
   Although prices in recent weeks have rebounded from their low of
$10 a barrel last December, over the past year 50,000 oil-industry
jobs in the United States have been lost and 140,000 unprofitable
wells have had to be plugged.
</P>
<P>
   Worst-affected have been the smaller producers in the Oil Patch
who operate so-called ``stripper'' wells. These high-cost wells,
which produce fewer than ten barrels a day, account for 20 percent
of domestic oil production.
</P>
<P>
   All over Texas, small family companies that have kept three
generations going have been forced into bankruptcy by the long
depression in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, representatives of independent producers lobbied
Congress for emergency relief. Yet few are optimistic that federal
aid will save their way of life.
</P>
<P>
   When small producers suffer, so do the towns they live in. As
businesses in west and central Texas go bust and families leave the
area in search of jobs elsewhere, the shrinking tax base has
devastated local schools, hospitals and government offices.
</P>
<P>
   In Stephens County, where Breckenridge sits, 1999 tax revenues
from the oil industry are projected to be only $112 million, down
from $146 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The school district has lost 10 percent of its pupils, along
with the state dollars that go with them.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the Oil Patch are used to cyclical recessions, and
the 1986 crash in oil prices was more dramatic than the recent
slump _ not least because oil was the only way to make a living
then.
</P>
<P>
   Yet oil producers now fear that the diversification of the Texas
economy (along with a greater reliance on foreign oil) has made
lawmakers less concerned with the plight of the domestic oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
   In little over a decade, the microchip has replaced the oil
derrick as the driving force behind the state's economy, making
Texas far less dependent on stable commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
   In March, unemployment in the state was at 4.5 percent, the
lowest for that month in 19 years. In Odessa, however, a city in
the oil-reliant Permian Basin, it was 10.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Oil Patch now feels left behind and discontented; and it has
found a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   On April 14 Pat Buchanan, that steel-ribbed nationalist and
perennial candidate for the Republican presidential nomination,
went to Odessa and vowed to make the United States free of ``cheap
foreign oil.''
</P>
<P>
   On the home turf of Governor George W. Bush, the Republican
front-runner, Buchanan's message drew rousing applause.
</P>
<P>
   Even with oil prices recovering from their 1998 lows, many in
the industry believe that the damage done to independent companies
may be irreparable.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of producers have gone bankrupt during the crisis, and
the wells that have been plugged can be reopened only at great
cost.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, as foreign oil each year represents a larger slice
of American consumption, the market share of domestic producers
continues to slip.
</P>
<P>
   According to one industry analyst, independent producers may
``survive the surgery, but die of pneumonia.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most worrying consequence of the past two years is
that declining revenues have forced oil companies to cut their
exploration budgets.
</P>
<P>
   If oil firms stop searching for new sites, it is likely that
domestic production will shrink over the next few years as the
present wells dry up. This could prolong the misery for smaller oil
companies, and hasten the decline of even more small Texas towns.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it could bring the end of an era that began in 1923,
when the first gusher gushed in west Texas. Its owners named the
well ``Santa Rita,'' after the patron saint of desperate causes. &QL;

   BRECKENRIDGE AND ODESSA, TEXAS _ In the 1920s, it was hard to
keep people out of Breckenridge. These days, it is harder to get
them to stay.
</P>
<P>
   A town that once boasted the world's most prolific oil
production and was a Mecca for ``wildcatters'' looking for an
instant fortune is now home to only a handful of oil producers
determined to eke out a living on what is left under the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Arnot, a third-generation oil engineer who is one of the
handful, speculates that there is very little future for a town
that depends so heavily on the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a good look around,'' he says. ``Pretty soon this place
is going to look like `The Last Picture Show.'''
</P>
<P>
   In common with hundreds of towns throughout the Texas and
Oklahoma Oil Patch, Breckenridge has been hit hard by a two-year
plunge in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   As cheap foreign oil floods the American market, driving the
price to an all-time low, domestic producers have had to sell their
oil at a price far below what it costs them to operate their wells.
</P>
<P>
   Although prices in recent weeks have rebounded from their low of
$10 a barrel last December, over the past year 50,000 oil-industry
jobs in the United States have been lost and 140,000 unprofitable
wells have had to be plugged.
</P>
<P>
   Worst-affected have been the smaller producers in the Oil Patch
who operate so-called ``stripper'' wells. These high-cost wells,
which produce fewer than ten barrels a day, account for 20 percent
of domestic oil production.
</P>
<P>
   All over Texas, small family companies that have kept three
generations going have been forced into bankruptcy by the long
depression in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, representatives of independent producers lobbied
Congress for emergency relief. Yet few are optimistic that federal
aid will save their way of life.
</P>
<P>
   When small producers suffer, so do the towns they live in. As
businesses in west and central Texas go bust and families leave the
area in search of jobs elsewhere, the shrinking tax base has
devastated local schools, hospitals and government offices.
</P>
<P>
   In Stephens County, where Breckenridge sits, 1999 tax revenues
from the oil industry are projected to be only $112 million, down
from $146 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The school district has lost 10 percent of its pupils, along
with the state dollars that go with them.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the Oil Patch are used to cyclical recessions, and
the 1986 crash in oil prices was more dramatic than the recent
slump _ not least because oil was the only way to make a living
then.
</P>
<P>
   Yet oil producers now fear that the diversification of the Texas
economy (along with a greater reliance on foreign oil) has made
lawmakers less concerned with the plight of the domestic oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
   In little over a decade, the microchip has replaced the oil
derrick as the driving force behind the state's economy, making
Texas far less dependent on stable commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
   In March, unemployment in the state was at 4.5 percent, the
lowest for that month in 19 years. In Odessa, however, a city in
the oil-reliant Permian Basin, it was 10.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Oil Patch now feels left behind and discontented; and it has
found a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   On April 14 Pat Buchanan, that steel-ribbed nationalist and
perennial candidate for the Republican presidential nomination,
went to Odessa and vowed to make the United States free of ``cheap
foreign oil.''
</P>
<P>
   On the home turf of Governor George W. Bush, the Republican
front-runner, Buchanan's message drew rousing applause.
</P>
<P>
   Even with oil prices recovering from their 1998 lows, many in
the industry believe that the damage done to independent companies
may be irreparable.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of producers have gone bankrupt during the crisis, and
the wells that have been plugged can be reopened only at great
cost.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, as foreign oil each year represents a larger slice
of American consumption, the market share of domestic producers
continues to slip.
</P>
<P>
   According to one industry analyst, independent producers may
``survive the surgery, but die of pneumonia.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most worrying consequence of the past two years is
that declining revenues have forced oil companies to cut their
exploration budgets.
</P>
<P>
   If oil firms stop searching for new sites, it is likely that
domestic production will shrink over the next few years as the
present wells dry up. This could prolong the misery for smaller oil
companies, and hasten the decline of even more small Texas towns.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it could bring the end of an era that began in 1923,
when the first gusher gushed in west Texas. Its owners named the
well ``Santa Rita,'' after the patron saint of desperate causes. &QL;

<P>
   Eight years ago, the American bombing of Iraq introduced a
fascinated public to the notion of weapons so ``smart'' that they
could weave their way through the labyrinths of central Baghdad
before unleashing their load with deadly accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   The arsenal deployed in that war was kids' stuff, defense buffs
now say. Less than a tenth of the bombs dropped were
precision-guided, whereas nearly all the weapons now being aimed at
Yugoslavia are equipped that way.
</P>
<P>
   Why, in that case, has the air campaign not been more
successful? After five weeks of war, NATO says it has wrecked
Serbia's oil-refining capacity and taken bites out of several other
industries, from tank-repair factories to producers of vacuum
cleaners and cars.
</P>
<P>
   It has destroyed six out of the seven bridges over the Danube
that link Serbia with points north.
</P>
<P>
   General Wesley Clark, the NATO commander, said this week his
bombers had inflicted ``moderate to severe'' damage on the Yugoslav
forces' communications and, by attacking roads and railways, had
made it much harder for them to send fresh troops to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains possible, he admits, for troops to ``walk through
the rivers and gullies and so forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor could NATO stop the dispatch to Kosovo, over the past few
days, of a few thousand newly mobilized reservists _ to replace
combat casualties, says the general.
</P>
<P>
   However patchy these achievements may sound, professional airmen
say that the bombers of Serbia have performed competently. When
targets have been pinpointed, they have invariably been well
struck.
</P>
<P>
   But there is the rub: finding things to bomb is hard when NATO
is under strong pressure to avoid either losing aircraft or killing
civilians _ and all the obvious targets have been hit already. At a
``safe'' altitude of 5,000 meters (16,250 feet), identifying
targets is often impossible.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, say pundits, it has been a ``good war'' for weapons
guided from space _ or to be precise, by America's Global
Positioning System (GPS), a network of satellites created by the
Pentagon and used by civilian navigators from all countries.
</P>
<P>
   But the other sort of smart weapon _ laser-guided munitions _
has been a disappointment because it cannot be used accurately in
cloudy or smoky conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The limits of laser guidance were highlighted tragically this
week by the accidental bombing of Surdulica, a town near Serbia's
border with Bulgaria, where at least 16 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is preparing to deploy a warhead known as
``Enhanced Paveway,'' which is guided by both satellites and
lasers. The GPS would be used to bring it through the clouds, and
only in the final stage would the laser actually be turned on.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem has been that GPS-guided weapons are in short
supply, though the Pentagon is scrambling to speed up deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, commanders are crying out for more devices known
as JDAMs _ joint direct attack munitions _ which can be strapped on
to ``dumb bombs'' and then steered by satellite.
</P>
<P>
   At only $20,000 each, JDAMs are better value than cruise
missiles _ also guided by satellite _ which can cost up to $1
million apiece.
</P>
<P>
   An ideal aircraft for delivering these smartened-up munitions is
the giant B-2 bomber, which can direct 16 of them at different
targets simultaneously, even in quite bad weather. But the B-2
itself is so expensive (at more than $2 billion) and so
embarrassing to lose that it can be sent into action only very
cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   Given the drawbacks of using air power alone, and the continuing
reluctance to make ground troops fight their way in, is there a
halfway house?
</P>
<P>
   American forces in Albania seem to be preparing to mount a sort
of land intervention without ever quite touching the ground.
</P>
<P>
   They have at last deployed, after several weeks' delay, a fleet
of 24 Apache helicopters (one of which crashed soon after arriving
at Tirana, Albania's capital) and a deadly form of artillery known
as Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS).
</P>
<P>
   However, there is a lingering fear that the Apaches _ each of
which carries 16 Hellfire antitank missiles with a range of eight
kilometers (five miles) _ could be vulnerable to hand-held
surface-to-air missiles, with which guerrillas brought down so many
Soviet helicopters in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   As for the MLRS artillery systems, which would be used in close
cooperation with the Apaches, their showers of ``steel rain'' could
kill huge numbers of Serbian troops.
</P>
<P>
   But since bombs which go astray or fail to explode immediately
are not primed to destroy themselves (as, for example, smart mines
are), they could also kill western soldiers if left in the path of
a NATO advance.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Apache and the MLRS will be ruthlessly effective if
NATO (maybe with the help of special forces or ethnic-Albanian
guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army) can clearly see Yugoslav
troop concentrations.
</P>
<P>
   But, despite the smartness of their eyes-in-the-sky (for
example, the J-STARS air-to-ground surveillance which America wants
Europe to buy), NATO's commanders still seem unsure where exactly
in Kosovo the Serbs' 40,000 troops and 400 or so armored vehicles
actually are. &QL;

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeanie Crane bakes chicken in a solar box cooker. It keeps her
electric bill down. Besides, she doesn't have a stove.
</P>
<P>
   Crane turns on the heat only when a few sweaters can't warm her
bones, and she unplugged her full-size refrigerator last year. She
even does without a real bed. Why cramp her one-room Fort Worth
apartment when the sofa is plenty comfortable?
</P>
<P>
   Crane is 58, the mother of a grown son and the former owner of a
profitable fabrics store. She still belongs to the Network for
Executive Women and has $100 season tickets to the classical music
series at Bass Performance Hall.
</P>
<P>
   But she lives in a 400-square-foot garage apartment, drives a
1984 Chrysler with rust spots, and shops for her clothes at thrift
stores. All on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly believe,'' Crane insists, ``frugality can set you
free.''
</P>
<P>
   The technical term for Crane's lifestyle is downshifting:
getting off the treadmill of earn more-spend more to live a less
stressful, more meaningful, more earth-friendly existence.
</P>
<P>
   The movement has gained enough momentum over the past decade
that the federal government is now subtly acknowledging its
existence. Downshifting authority Betsy Taylor will speak about the
trend Tuesday at the National Town Meeting for a Sustainable
America. The President's Council on Sustainable Development is
sponsoring the four-day conference, which runs through Wednesday in
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The promoters of downshifting _ authors such as Juliet Schor and
organizations like the New Road Map Foundation _ emphasize the
connection between the world's dwindling natural resources and
Americans' seemingly endless need to acquire things. Our insatiable
appetite for more, they suggest, has not only left us deep in debt
but also with less time to do the things that really make us happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `more is better' definition of the American Dream has a
lot of hidden costs,'' said Taylor, executive director of the
Center for a New American Dream.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, according to downshifters, is simply to buy less
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Crane gave up a $60,000-plus annual income to pursue her ideal
job: recording storytelling audio tapes for senior citizens. She
manages a thrift store part time and works 15 hours a week at a
retail shop to support herself. Her stress level has plunged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a varied life, and it's very satisfying,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not the life most Americans aspire to.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 50 years, the average U.S. home size has doubled,
and the average person's spending may have jumped as much as 70
percent, according to Schor's book ``The Overspent American,''
recently released in paperback. Yet, survey after survey reveals
that, on the whole, we're less satisfied with our lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a growing awareness that the earth does have limits,
and we as individuals also have limits,'' said Taylor, former
director of the Merck Family Fund, an environmental foundation. If
the whole world consumed like Americans do, she said, it would take
``four more planets right now'' to keep up with the demand for
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Taylor co-founded the Center for the New American Dream
with the goal of helping people ``reduce and change the way they
consume, and improve their quality of life.'' The group's Web site
received a half-million hits in the first quarter of 1999, twice as
many as during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working parents feel a squeeze _ trying to parent, trying to
work, trying to have a community life _ and they are hungry for
more time,'' Taylor said. At least one expert speaking about kids
and violence in the aftermath of the Columbine High School
shootings noted that parents today feel immense pressure to work
long hours to earn more money and, presumably, buy more stuff. This
leaves less time to build healthy relationships with their kids.
</P>
<P>
   That stress, coupled with a willingness to live with less stuff,
is fueling a growing interest in downshifting, Taylor believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Downshifting is a huge movement, and there's not one way to do
it,'' Taylor said. ``There are millions of Americans opting to
reduce their work and their pay in order to get more time. For
some, that's job sharing, for some it's going to a four-day week,
for some it's just not taking a promotion that would mean a heavier
workload.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1995, Kathy Huddle-Hall was miserable at her management
job with a local hospital. She and her husband worked long hours
and rewarded themselves with a big house in Mansfield southeast of
Fort Worth. But they had little time to spend with their two boys.
They bought things to make themselves feel better about their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were into `running on the treadmill': earning big money and
spending big money,'' Huddle-Hall said. ``We truly believed the
more money you made, the happier you should be.''

   Given the drawbacks of using air power alone, and the continuing
reluctance to make ground troops fight their way in, is there a
halfway house?
</P>
<P>
   American forces in Albania seem to be preparing to mount a sort
of land intervention without ever quite touching the ground.
</P>
<P>
   They have at last deployed, after several weeks' delay, a fleet
of 24 Apache helicopters (one of which crashed soon after arriving
at Tirana, Albania's capital) and a deadly form of artillery known
as Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS).
</P>
<P>
   However, there is a lingering fear that the Apaches _ each of
which carries 16 Hellfire antitank missiles with a range of eight
kilometers (five miles) _ could be vulnerable to hand-held
surface-to-air missiles, with which guerrillas brought down so many
Soviet helicopters in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   As for the MLRS artillery systems, which would be used in close
cooperation with the Apaches, their showers of ``steel rain'' could
kill huge numbers of Serbian troops.
</P>
<P>
   But since bombs which go astray or fail to explode immediately
are not primed to destroy themselves (as, for example, smart mines
are), they could also kill western soldiers if left in the path of
a NATO advance.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Apache and the MLRS will be ruthlessly effective if
NATO (maybe with the help of special forces or ethnic-Albanian
guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army) can clearly see Yugoslav
troop concentrations.
</P>
<P>
   But, despite the smartness of their eyes-in-the-sky (for
example, the J-STARS air-to-ground surveillance which America wants
Europe to buy), NATO's commanders still seem unsure where exactly
in Kosovo the Serbs' 40,000 troops and 400 or so armored vehicles
actually are. &QL;

PILL TAKING, NOT PILL, IS OFTEN THE PROBLEM IN HYPERTENSION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (af)  
 By ABIGAIL ZUGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   People with high blood pressure often fail to respond to
medication, leading their doctors to prescribe more and more pills
for them. Instead, doctors should help them remember to take the
pills they already have, according to an international expert in
blood pressure control.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Boston on Friday at a conference on pill-taking
behavior sponsored by the American Heart Association, Dr. Hans R.
Brunner, a professor of medicine at the University of Lausanne in
Switzerland, said that more than half the time, cases of high blood
pressure that seemed beyond the control of standard blood pressure
drugs could actually be easily controlled when patients began to
take the drugs correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Brunner collaborated with Dr. Michel Burnier on a study at the
university of 40 men and women with high blood pressure that
remained elevated despite a combination of three different blood
pressure drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The participants in the study put their pills in containers with
electronic memory devices in the caps that registered every time
the bottle was opened.
</P>
<P>
   The data in the caps were then downloaded into a computer and
transformed into graphs on paper so that the participants could see
how often they forgot to take their medications over a period of
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In more than half of the patients, blood pressure fell to normal
levels when they realized how many doses they were skipping and
worked out ways to remember to take the pills correctly. Only a
third required major adjustments in their medications for their
blood pressure to fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the No. 1 problem in the management of hypertension
today,'' Brunner said. ``We have wonderful drugs for treating high
blood pressure, but using some kind of monitoring of pill taking
has to become an integrated part of the tools we use, together with
the drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   High blood pressure affects nearly 50 million Americans, but it
is adequately controlled in less than 30 percent of them, according
to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
sponsored by the National Center for Health Statistics. In some
people the blood pressure remains high because they stop taking
medications or never begin them, but in many others blood pressure
medication just seems not to work.
</P>
<P>
   The survey showed that only 55 percent of people who take blood
pressure medication have normal blood pressure levels.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that lowering blood pressure to normal levels
greatly reduces the risk of dying from strokes and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Some people fail to take their medications because of side
effects, Brunner said, but many others simply forget, and are
unaware of how many doses they skip. ``Doctors must learn that this
is normal behavior,'' he said, and learn to help patients
compensate for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors often ask about pill taking in a very half-hearted
way,'' said Dr. Thomas H. Lee, a cardiologist at Harvard University
who is the medical director of Partners Community Health Care, a
managed care organization in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   If paying more attention to the issue means doctors can avoid
prescribing escalating combinations of stronger, more expensive
blood pressure drugs, Lee said, there will be a double benefit:
preserving the patient's health and doing it more cheaply.

TURTLES VANISH IN LACK HOLE: SOUP POTS AND PANS OF CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ore., N.C., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By CAROL KAESUK YOON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the world's great centers of turtle and tortoise
diversity, Southeast Asia has long teemed with species found
nowhere else in the world. But in recent years, researchers say,
this biological treasure trove has become a gold mine for
profiteers who have been gathering every turtle in sight for sale
as food and medicinals in the turtle markets of China.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists say collectors have made such a clean sweep of
turtles in countries like Vietnam and Laos that it can be
impossible to find a single turtle even in ideal habitats in
national parks and remote preserves.
</P>
<P>
   In the regions of Southeast Asia where turtles do persist,
biologists say, they are fast disappearing to satisfy the huge,
some say infinite, demand for turtles in China. Scientists have
been reduced to looking for turtles in China's markets as they say
an entire fauna is being bought, sold and eaten into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southeast Asia is being vacuumed of its turtles for China's
food markets,'' said Dr. John Behler, chairman of the freshwater
tortoise and turtle specialist group at the International Union for
the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. ``The China
markets are a black hole for turtles.''
</P>
<P>
   Behler, who is also a curator at the Wildlife Conservation
Society, said even endangered species whose trade was forbidden by
the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, a
treaty administered by the United Nations, were showing up in
China's markets headed for the soup pot and the frying pan.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Thorbjarnarson, coordinator of international reptile
conservation programs at Wildlife Conservation Society, said:
``Uncontrolled trade into China is the No. 1 threat. It's an
immense problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The severity of the problem has become starkly clear to
biologists trying to study the turtles of this poorly known region.
</P>
<P>
   In Vietnam, for example, turtles had been reported as very
common in the 1980s, even around cities like Hanoi, said Dr. Ross
Kiester, a research scientist with the Federal Forest Service in
Corvallis, Ore. But when he spent a month in 1996 searching
Vietnam's national parks and remote preserves, ``We found two
individual turtles in the field,'' he said. ``They have some
amazing national parks _ it's just that there were no turtles.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation is little better in Laos. ``The greatest density
of turtles I've ever encountered was three turtles,'' said Bryan
Stuart, a herpetologist at North Carolina State University who has
been searching in Laos over the past year. ``In a month's time, you
might find less than a half-dozen turtles in the field.''
Researchers say they hear similar stories coming out of Cambodia
and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Studies of actual export numbers corroborate the anecdotal
evidence for large-scale exportation of these turtles. According to
reports from Traffic, a wildlife trade monitoring program, more
than 240 tons of turtles, representing more than 200,000 individual
turtles, were leaving Vietnam each year for sale in China in 1994.
By 1996, two to four tons of turtles were being exported each day
from Phnom Penh in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the easiest place to find these turtles today is in
China's markets. In July 1997, Dr. William McCord, a veterinarian
from Hopewell Junction, N.Y., who does research on turtles, made a
videotape recording an estimated 10,000 turtles for sale during a
visit to a wildlife market in the southern Chinese city of
Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the species were from outside China. In any medium-
to large-size city, researchers say they see turtles listed on
restaurant menus, and sometimes they turn out to be very rare
species.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a weird way to do field work,'' said Dr. Steven Platt,
field herpetologist with the Wildlife Conservation Society. ``You
figure you'll be out in the sticks looking for turtles, but you
spend a lot of your time going to restaurants and markets to see
what's there. You go and see all these turtles, species you've only
read about in books, and you see them stacked in the markets
waiting to be eaten.''
</P>
<P>
   Even entirely unknown species turn up. McCord said he had
discovered a dozen new species of turtles in Chinese markets, his
most recently published finding being Mauremys pritchardi,
discovered in the capital city of Yunnan province. Researchers say
such finds point to the possibility that species are being sold
into extinction before scientists ever see them.
</P>
<P>
   The high value of wild-caught turtles has turned much of the
rural populace of Southeast Asia into a kind of enormous net of
collectors, making it almost impossible for researchers to see
turtles first. For example, Platt said he considered himself lucky
to have seen two Sulawesi Forest Turtles in the wild, a first for a
Western biologist, though the species was readily available for
sale.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   While there is a long tradition of using turtles for food and
medicine in Asia, researchers say turtle exports from Southeast
Asia into China skyrocketed in the 1990s after China's currency
became easier to convert. Demand ``exponentially increased,'' said
Dr. Michael W. Klemens, a conservation scientist at the Wildlife
Conservation Society and director of its turtle recovery program.
</P>
<P>
   With many sea turtles and tortoises having been in trouble for
years, Klemens said the current crisis with land turtles and
tortoises in Southeast Asia was making chelonians, as the group as
a whole is known, one of the vertebrate groups with the highest
proportion of endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   In the marketplace, the price of a single turtle can range from
a few dollars to more than a thousand. The three-striped box
turtle, or Cuora trifasciata, from Vietnam has a reputation among
the Chinese as a cure for cancer, and Kiester said a Vietnamese
collector could sell one to a dealer for $1,200 _ about six times
the average annual income. As a result, that turtle has become
extremely rare.
</P>
<P>
   Even turtles that do not have the allure of being lifesaving
medicinals are highly valued. For while turtle eating in the United
States remains very limited, in China, turtles are a valued part of
the culture and cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a status symbol to serve turtle meat,'' Platt said.
``It's not cheap.'' In addition, in China where medicinal and food
uses are often one and the same, the Chinese are said to consume
very specific turtle parts, like the blood or the ground-up shell
as aphrodisiacs, promoters of longevity or cures for lethargy,
lumbago and difficult childbirths.
</P>
<P>
   With turtles gone from many parts of Southeast Asia, researchers
say dealers are now starting to look elsewhere. ``First it was
Vietnam and Cambodia and Laos,'' Behler said. ``Now it's Myanmar
and Indonesia. The tentacles of that octopus have spread all the
way to North America.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the export of turtles from the United States has soared,
said Craig Hoover, program officer for Traffic's North American
office. By 1995, the United States was shipping out more than
84,000 map turtles, 23,000 snapping turtles and 38,000 softshell
turtles each year _ increases of fivefold to fortyfold since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of these increases can be explained by
China's increased ability to purchase commodities from abroad,''
Hoover said.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists are becoming increasingly concerned that turtle
populations in the United States cannot sustain such harvests,
especially given the lack of regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless they're listed on the Endangered Species Act, there's
no federal law protecting turtles,'' said Dr. Susan Lieberman,
chief of the office of scientific authority for the United States
Fish and Wildlife Service in Washington. State laws are spotty, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the turtles sold in China are used for food or
medicinals, some researchers are also concerned about the
international pet trade, which has among its biggest buyers the
United States, Europe and Japan. While researchers agree the pet
trade is considerably smaller in volume than the trade in China's
food markets, it is problematic for a variety of reasons,
especially because it specifically targets rare species.
</P>
<P>
   But many biologists say if anything is going to save Southeast
Asia's turtles from extinction, it will probably be the amateur
enthusiasts who support the pet trade and are willing to breed
these turtles and keep them alive.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, researchers, becoming ever more accustomed to
empty ponds and rivers, are pinning their hopes on rumors of
turtles lurking here and there and and are trying to understand
this disappearing fauna by shopping the markets and scanning the
restaurant menus.

<P>
   The stories of compulsive gamblers could make the hardest heart
weep.
</P>
<P>
   A 75-year-old man from New Jersey lost nearly his entire
retirement fund when he turned to gambling to fight the loneliness
and depression that gripped him after his wife died.
</P>
<P>
   A Philadelphia boy, 17, stole from his parents, forcing them to
lock up everything he could pawn. Then he landed in prison twice
for credit card fraud and bad checks. He tried to commit suicide
before finally entering a recovery program.
</P>
<P>
   A 50-year-old woman from upstate New York used the maximum
amounts of six credit cards and spent her daughter's trust fund on
the craps table and poker machine, then tried to kill herself
before turning to Gambler's Anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman gambled away her son's college tuition and a third
woman's husband left her because she could not control her
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   By the time most compulsive gamblers seek help, they are hugely
in debt, owing as much as $120,000 or more, and their families are
a shambles. About 80 percent seriously consider suicide; 13 percent
to 20 percent attempt suicide or succeed in killing themselves, a
rate higher than that for major depression.
</P>
<P>
   More than five million Americans are pathological or problem
gamblers, and another 15 million are at risk of falling into the
same morass, according to a study reported last month by the
National Gambling Impact Study Commission.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5 percent of people develop a gambling problem at some
time, five times the rate of schizophrenia and twice that of
cocaine addiction, said Dr. Nancy Petry, a psychologist studying
treatment for compulsive gamblers at the University of Connecticut
Health Center in Farmington.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, 95 percent of compulsive gamblers were men, but
now nearly a third are women and a growing number are teen-agers.
Americans are spending more than $500 billion a year on gambling,
an amount that has doubled in a decade. And opportunities to gamble
are increasing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the traditional venues of race tracks and casinos in
Las Vegas, Reno and Atlantic City are state lotteries, quick-draw
games and casinos with all kinds of enticements on Indian
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   All but two states have legalized gambling in the form of
lotteries, dog races and horse races, and since the late 1980s
casinos have opened in 27 states and Puerto Rico. Now there is also
gambling on the Internet, so that people can place bets without
leaving home and without anyone in the family knowing what they are
doing.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, the incidence of problem gambling is
highest in states with the most sources of legal gambling. And for
many, the problem starts early in life.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide studies by Dr. Howard Shaffer, a psychology professor
at Harvard University, revealed a rate of problem gambling among
adolescents of 9.4 percent compared with 3.8 percent for adults.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that 10 percent to 15 percent of youths who start
gambling soon lose some control over their gambling behavior and
that men with severe gambling problems typically started gambling
before they were 14. But most women who are problem gamblers never
gambled in their youth.
</P>
<P>
   Although in 1980 the American Psychiatric Association defined
compulsive gambling as an addiction problem comparable to alcohol
and drug abuse, pathological gambling has received relatively
little attention. Only 150 gambling counselors are certified
nationwide, compared with hundreds of thousands of drug and alcohol
abuse counselors, Dr. Petry said.
</P>
<P>
   As with other addictions, compulsive gamblers develop tolerance
and withdrawal symptoms. The psychiatric association's diagnostic
manual lists addiction characteristics that include a need to
increase the amount and frequency of the behavior to achieve the
desired excitement (tolerance); discomfort upon being abstinent
(withdrawal); inability to control the behavior, despite repeated
efforts to cut down or quit; continuing the behavior despite the
realization that it is causing serious problems; engaging in the
behavior more often and for longer than intended and experiencing
interference with other functions of life.
</P>
<P>
   Problem gamblers are driven by the need to be ``in action'' _ to
feel the arousal and euphoria from betting that other addicts get
from drugs or alcohol, said Dr. Sheila B. Blume, medical director
of the alcoholism, chemical dependency and compulsive gambling
programs at South Oaks Hospital in Amityville, N.Y. Winning brings
a high comparable to that of addictive drugs; losses result in
acute distress driving a gambler to try to recoup the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Many compulsive gamblers have other addictions as well. About
half who enter treatment programs have histories of substance
abuse. Dr. Blume estimates that there are about 40 treatment
programs for gamblers in about two dozen states based on approaches
used for other addictive disorders.
</P>
<P>
   But she and Dr. Petry said that few professionals looked for
gambling problems in their clients and few programs were prepared
to treat them.
</P>
<P>
   Gamblers Anonymous, patterned on the 12 steps and group support
of Alcoholics Anonymous, is the most established program with
documented effectiveness. Dr. Petry has begun a study of a
different approaches that has shown early encouraging results and
will soon receive the first grant ever awarded by the National
Institute of Mental Health for the gambling addiction treatment.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 120 pathological gamblers will take part in a study
of cognitive behavioral therapy in which participants will learn
how to identify the factors that set off their gambling behavior,
identify gambling patterns related to life occurrences and develop
obstacles and alternatives to gambling.
</P>
<P>
   A third of participants will go through an eight-week program
guided by a professional therapist, another third will use a
self-help manual on their own and a third will serve as the control
group. All participants will also be referred to Gamblers
Anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Participants will also be shown how to manage financial
problems. The group insists that gamblers pay off their debts,
however slowly. Those interested in participating in Dr. Petry's

DRUG OFFERS HOPE FOR ELDERLY WITH EYE DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Md., N.Y., Calif.)   (af)  
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A drug activated by shining light into the eye could offer hope
for people suffering from age-related macular degeneration, the
leading cause of severe vision loss in the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The condition, a deterioration of the retina, affects an
estimated 25 percent of Americans over the age of 65. It is now
virtually untreatable.
</P>
<P>
   But in a clinical trial involving about 600 patients, 61.4
percent of those who took the drug, known as Visudyne, had vision
that was either stable or improved after one year, compared with
45.9 percent of patients in a comparison group.
</P>
<P>
   While such results show only modest effectiveness, ``when you
have a modest difference for a huge disease it's pretty
important,'' said Dr. Neil M. Bressler, a professor of
ophthalmology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine
and the principal investigator in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, announcement of the results touched off a huge gain in
the stock of the drug's developer, QLT Phototherapeutics of
Vancouver, Canada. QLT intends to apply to the Food and Drug
Administration for approval to sell the Visudyne in partnership
with Ciba Vision, a division of Swiss drug giant Novartis AG.
</P>
<P>
   Macular degeneration gradually destroys the macula, the central
part of the retina that picks up the finest details of what people
see. People with the condition experience a partial or complete
loss of central vision.
</P>
<P>
   They usually can still see out of the side of the eye, but such
peripheral vision is often not sharp enough to allow them to read,
watch television, recognize faces or drive.
</P>
<P>
   Some 80 percent to 90 percent of cases are of the so-called dry
form, in which yellow deposits accumulate on the retina. The more
serious wet form is marked by the growth of abnormal, leaky blood
vessels behind the retina.
</P>
<P>
   Visudyne is only for the wet form, which, while less common,
accounts for most of the cases of blindness caused by the
condition. The company estimates there are 200,000 new cases of the
wet form diagnosed in North America each year.
</P>
<P>
   The only treatment now available is to destroy the blood vessels
with a laser. But this treatment is suitable for only a small
percentage of patients. Also, the laser can injure healthy cells.
</P>
<P>
   But photodynamic therapy, as the use of light-activated drugs is
called, ``is more like a smart missile,'' said Dr. Richard B. Rosen
of the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary.
</P>
<P>
   Visudyne accumulates preferentially in the fast-growing blood
vessels behind the retina. The drug is given intravenously, and
about 15 minutes later a red laser is shined into the eye for about
a minute and a half. The drug is activated and destroys the
abnormal cells while doing little damage to surrounding tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Photodynamic therapy has been used with limited success against
cancer, but it appears to be finding its niche in macular
degeneration. Miravant Medical Technologies of Santa Barbara,
Calif., is testing another light-activated drug for macular
degeneration, in partnership with Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Julia G. Levy, president of QLT, said her inspiration came
in part from the fact that her own mother, who has since died, got
the disease at 85 and three years later could not watch television
or read.
</P>
<P>
   ``She used to try to convince herself she could see better than
she could,'' Dr. Levy recalled. ``She didn't want people to know
she couldn't see.''
</P>
<P>
   Many desperate patients are expected to flock to Visudyne if it
is approved. But some experts say the trial results were not that
impressive. Even when vision was stabilized, meaning a loss of
fewer than three lines on a standard eye chart, it rarely improved.
</P>
<P>
   Only 16 percent of treated patients registered an improvement of
at least one line on the eye chart, compared with 7 percent in the
control group. Moreover, the stabilization does not appear to be
permanent and the drug cannot repair already-damaged retinal
tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible treatments being tested include radiation
therapy, surgery and anti-angiogenesis drugs, which block the
formation of blood vessels and have attracted attention as a new
approach to cancer therapy.
</P>
<P>
   While a cure remains elusive, Bressler said, ``We'll chip away
slowly and surely and make the quality of life for these people
better.''

<P>
   PENNGROVE, Calif. _ Gerald Haslam slipped a cassette of Maddox
Brothers and Rose into the tape player and listened to ``Sally, Let
Your Bangs Hang Down,'' grinning when the group got to the verse,
``Sally calls me her man, but she's a-gettin' all she can.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a very popular line among grade-school boys in
Oildale when I was growing up,'' said Haslam, 61, who lives in
Penngrove, a town of 900 south of Santa Rosa. ``The teacher sure
didn't want to hear you singing this song.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other songs teachers didn't want to hear youngsters
singing, said Haslam _ most of them country songs, put down as
``Okie'' music in the '40s and early '50s, when Haslam was going to
school with Merle Haggard in Oildale.
</P>
<P>
   Haslam, a retired Sonoma State University professor, has made a
crusade of fighting the white-trash image of ``Okie'' music. In his
new book, ``Workin' Man Blues,'' published by the University of
California Press, Haslam argues that California had a strong
country music tradition even before the Okie migration of the 1930s
and the influx of Hollywood cowboys in the '40s.
</P>
<P>
   Because so much of the definition and direction of country music
has been dictated by Nashville, Haslam feels a need to offer
another viewpoint, to spread the gospel of California country.
</P>
<P>
   During the month of May, he'll move through Stockton,
Bakersfield, Fresno, Menlo Park, Santa Rosa, Sonoma and San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Haslam wants to do away with the elitism that labels country
music as ``redneck California is country too music, peckerwood
music, Okie music ... to me, American culture is of a piece. I
don't think there's high art and low art. They're intertwined with
one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Haslam is squarely in the camp of country singers like Haggard
and Buck Owens. To Haslam, their music flies in the face of the
bland, orchestrated country of stars such as Garth Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Country's being held in check by what I call the gatekeepers
in Nashville,'' he said. ``You go to a Garth Brooks concert, all
the smoke, the lights flashing ... he's going to have a pointed bra
out there next.''
</P>
<P>
   While Haslam champions Haggard and Owens, ``The Comprehensive
Country Music Encyclopedia'' counts them among ``new
traditionalists,'' those who've followed the lead of Hank Williams,
Bob Wills and Patsy Cline _ from Haggard and Owens to Emmylou
Harris, George Strait, Ricky Skaggs, Iris DeMent and Dwight Yoakam.
</P>
<P>
   The encyclopedia smugly notes ``the success of Garth Brooks ...
and the infusion of more rock and pop music attitudes into country
in the early '90s, effectively ended the New Traditionalist era.''
</P>
<P>
   But Haslam rejects that notion, saying, ``People have asked me
to define country music. I just tell them to listen to Buck Owens
and the Buckeroos doing `Second Fiddle.'''
</P>
<P>
   Haslam also rejects the notion that traditionalism has breathed
its last. Real country music grabs you with its rhythms, he said,
with its heartbreaking words and its call to dance. And that isn't
about to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``This music has always been blacker than its audience, which is
why it's been rejected in other places,'' he said. ``But in
California, it was never really rejected.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name the songs that most say ``country'' to him, Haslam
starts with a black singer, Stoney Edwards, and his classic,
``She's My Rock.'' The other country songs Haslam cites are Owens'
``Act Naturally,'' Lefty Frizzell's ``I Can't Get Over You to Save
My Life,'' ``Sally Let Your Bangs Hang Down'' from the Maddox
Brothers and Rose, Bob Willis' ``Roly Poly'' and Tex Williams'
``Smoke! Smoke! Smoke! (That Cigarette).''
</P>
<P>
   None of those tunes are likely to make the Nashville Top 10, but
Nashville's hold on country hasn't been good for the music, Haslam
said. ``I'm not anti-Nashville, I'm just against the dominance of
Nashville.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the home of the Grand Ol' Opry and the headquarters of
country taste, Nashville tends to hold grudges against bands that
buck the trend, said Haslam, against people who have gone their own
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, Rose Maddox has never been inducted into the Country
Hall of Fame,'' he said. ``Do you believe that ...'
</P>
<P>
   This is the same Nashville, Haslam said, that embraced the
``country'' music of Olivia Newton-John and Barbara Mandrell. He
pointed with pride at ``California's fierce retention of
hard-country styles in the face of soft country's national
domination.''
</P>
<P>
   The state has also backed rockabilly, which Elvis Presley called
``nothing but hopped-up country.''
</P>
<P>
   But nowadays Haslam has to search the radio dial to find
stations that play traditional country. ``What they're calling
country on radio now is very much this stuff, this marmalade,'' he
said. ``Homogenized, Big Mac music.''
</P>
<P>
   To Haslam, real country is drawn from a sense of loneliness,
``almost a sense of abandonment'' that came to the workers who gave
up their homes and emigrated to places like Detroit and Chicago and
California, to the shipyards around the San Francisco Bay, once the
hotbed of country honky-tonk.
</P>
<P>
   As a Tommy Collins tape played in the background, Haslam counted
off the names of country stars who came to California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray Price, Tex Williams, George Jones, Johnny Cash ... they
were almost an afterthought in California's musical history. It's
amazing to me that these people passed through this state without
really being acknowledged.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, for someone who grew up with Haggard, Haslam's
book offers no interview with Haggard, and precious few personal
insights. Although he worked on the book for more than five years,
Haslam said Haggard was always ``too busy'' to sit down for an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Haslam's touch is also missing in the chapter on Owens, who at
one point could claim 16 straight No. 1 tunes on the Billboard
charts and is still a force in country music.
</P>
<P>
   But Haslam's impassioned defense of country music and the wealth
of pictures from the early days of California honky-tonk make
``Workin' Man Blues'' a certifiable classic.

UNDATED: you should be.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a lunch break one day, Huddle-Hall wandered into a bookstore
and stumbled onto Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin's book ``Your Money
or Your Life.'' She read it in three days. She read parts to her
husband. She began taking steps the authors suggested to change her
relationship with money.
</P>
<P>
   It worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most incredible sense of power came over me,'' said
Huddle-Hall, 45. She stopped eating lunch out every day and buying
coffee every morning. She stopped going to the garden center on the
weekends and picking up knickknacks she really didn't need. She
started socking away big chunks of her paycheck, which turned out
to be very lucky.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1996, Huddle-Hall lost her job.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of panicking, she took the opportunity to downshift.
With her husband still working, Huddle-Hall decided her new career
would be to stay at home and save money.
</P>
<P>
   She began reading ``The Tightwad Gazette,'' a newsletter out of
Maine. She cut her grocery bill from $140 a week to $80 by
comparative shopping. She started cooking meals from scratch and
built a solar oven.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Huddle-Hall became aware of the effect her buying
habits had on the environment. Instead of buying clothes that need
to be dry-cleaned, she now sticks to natural fabrics. Instead of
buying a new pair of shoes for each outfit, she has two sensible
pairs that go with everything.
</P>
<P>
   In three years, Huddle-Hall's entire outlook on consumption, the
environment, money and life changed. She's happy. She went back to
work part time, on her own terms. She and her husband plan on
retiring early and spending their time volunteering.
</P>
<P>
   ``What (''Your Money or Your Life'') taught me is you deserve to
have power over your money, because earning your money is how you
spend your life energy,'' Huddle-Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Learning to live inexpensively frees you to do some of the
things you really, really want to do in life without waiting until
you're a millionaire or (retired),'' added Crane, who formerly
taught a seminar titled ``Living on Less Successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowering consumption has the added benefit of relieving a
seriously overtaxed environment, Taylor stressed. Americans
especially, she said, must face the fact that ``the planet is
broken and the planet has limits, and our lifestyles have a direct
effect on that.''

<P>
   Cyclocross, a sport that combines aspects of mountain biking,
steeplechasing and NASCAR auto racing, is beginning to develop a
following in the United States after decades of popularity in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   For the very committed, it is part of the extreme sports trend,
but other enthusiasts hail it as an activity for anyone who can
ride a bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   Cyclocross participants ride laps over a narrow loop that is
filled with obstacles like logs, sand pits, mud puddles and
obstructions that include fences and piles of plywood. Cyclocross
events are often put together by enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   Courses travel over soggy meadows, stream beds and dirt trails.
Generally, no more than half the distance traverses paved road.
Riders must hop off their bikes several times over the three-mile
course, sling them over their shoulders and sprint over unbikable
terrain on foot.
</P>
<P>
   A pit stop is required every few laps to allow the rider's crew
to make a few quick adjustments or change a tire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pit area is a very exciting place to be,'' said Tim
Johnson, a professional cyclist who lives in Middleton, Mass.
``There are mechanics and handlers working frantically to get their
cyclist back out on the course _ just like in auto racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson believes that cyclocross is a good activity for the
average cyclist because, though fast and challenging, it does not
require superior athletic ability. ``Most riders are out there to
have fun and spend an hour or so covering themselves and their
bikes in mud,'' he said. Most people can adequately prepare
themselves for a cyclocross ride by working out an hour a day three
or four days a week, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edmund Burke, an exercise physiologist and author of
``Serious Cycling'' (Human Kinetics, 1995) agrees. ``A cyclocross
race takes no longer than an hour or so to complete, so daily
two-hour training sessions on the bike aren't necessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he recommends several short, high-intensity cycling
workouts a week, some uphill running, plus two or three weight
training sessions weekly that concentrate on the lower back,
abdominal and leg muscles. ``Training and racing cyclocross get you
into great shape because it's an ultimate cross-training
experience,'' he said. ``It involves running, cycling, jumping,
climbing, and lifting.''
</P>
<P>
   Popularity of cyclocross seems greatest in the Northwest, West
and Northeast. Events are often held in urban areas with good park
systems like Seattle and New York City. Burke speculates that part
of the reason for cyclocross' growing popularity is that it
requires an investment of no more than a few hundred dollars.
Though top racers ride fancy European-made cyclocross cycles that
cost upwards of $2,000, most riders make do with old road bikes
retrofitted with wide brakes and skinny, nubby tires designed for
control and traction.
</P>
<P>
   Pit crews typically consist of family members and friends who do
not mind getting splattered with mud as cyclists fly by.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 21, thinks it has potential as a spectator sport as
well. Indeed, when he claimed the bronze medal at the Cyclocross
World Championships in Slovakia in February, 10,000 spectators were
on hand, and the race was broadcast live throughout Europe. ``It's
a multilap event, so people can line the course,'' Johnson said.
``Plus it's easy to tell who's winning.''
</P>
<P>
   The cyclocross racing season begins in late summer. For
information about cyclocross events and clubs, contact USA Cycling
(719) 578-4581 or visit its Web site (www.usacycling.org).
</P>
<P>
   The Mud Zone (www.themudzone.com) is also a good source for
beginners.

CORPORATE POLLUTERS ESCAPE BUSH'S BIG STICK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush's oft-repeated call for
people to accept personal responsibility for their actions
certainly has a responsible ring to it. But it also has a hollow
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is well known for exhorting wayward youths and struggling
welfare recipients, in particular, to straighten out their lives if
they want to avoid undesirable consequences. All told, it's pretty
sound advice.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has delivered a similar message _ up to a point _
to the corporate citizens of Texas, most notably those industries
responsible for large amounts of the pollutants that befoul our air
and threaten the health of responsible and irresponsible people
alike.
</P>
<P>
   Bush preaches corporate responsibility when he asks companies
operating the oldest industrial plants in the state to voluntarily
upgrade their equipment and reduce their emissions.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a double standard in his messages. Sanctions await
delinquent youths and welfare moms _ but not the ``grandfathered''
industrial polluters _ who don't heed the governor's plea.
</P>
<P>
   During his first legislative session in 1995, Bush proposed _
and the Legislature adopted _ welfare changes that, among other
things, require recipients of public assistance to go to work or
lose their benefits. And lawmakers, with Bush's backing, toughened
penalties for juvenile criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bush not only wants to penalize the welfare mothers who
refuse to work, but also wants to penalize their children by
cutting off the entire family from cash assistance. The self-styled
compassionate conservative says that, in the long-term war to break
the welfare cycle, that is the ``compassionate'' thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   In a further crackdown on juvenile offenders, the governor is
backing legislation to require automatic detention for youths
arrested for using firearms to commit crimes.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush proposed that students who fail after three tries to
pass the standardized skills test for their grade level not be
promoted. Although the bill is being revised by lawmakers, it could
be considered the governor's ``tough love'' approach to ending
social promotions.
</P>
<P>
   The governor obviously recognizes that sanctions are often
necessary to promote responsibility. But he offers no big stick if
some of the state's worst corporate polluters don't clean up their
acts.
</P>
<P>
   These facilities aren't exempted from all environmental
regulations. But they are exempted _ or ``grandfathered'' _ from
state permits and the stricter pollution controls that those
permits generally require because the plants already existed or
were under construction in 1971, when new emissions standards were
imposed under the Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   Bush insists the voluntary approach is working because about 50
companies have agreed to reduce their air emissions at more than
100 plant sites. But that is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Grandfathered plants, according to state government's own
estimate, account for about one-third of the industrial air
emissions in Texas. That is particularly significant at a time when
metropolitan areas like Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth violate the
national health standard for ozone smog.
</P>
<P>
   It also is particularly unacceptable when you consider the fact
that corporate leaders, when they lobbied for their exemptions in
1971, argued that old plants would soon be closed or forced to
obtain permits for major modifications.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight years later, that's a pretty worn-out argument.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature is considering a bill _ the Senate has already
approved it _ that would formalize the voluntary program and
encourage companies to upgrade their emissions controls. But the
measure wouldn't require companies to sign up and wouldn't penalize
those that didn't.
</P>
<P>
   There is the threat that lawmakers, maybe next session, maybe
not, would clamp down on companies that don't cooperate. But the
public's health deserves a tougher stance from the public's elected
representatives now.
</P>
<P>
   There's another major _ and relevant _ difference between
government's relationship to corporate polluters and its
relationship to juveniles and welfare moms. People associated with
corporate polluters make big political contributions to state
officials.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report prepared by environmentalists, who are
waging a tough war against the voluntary program, Bush, Lt. Gov.
Rick Perry and current members of the Legislature have received
more than $4.6 million in industry-related donations during the
past six years.
</P>
<P>
   Although those contributions may not have purchased the hearts
and minds of elected officials, in many cases they bought the next
best things _ their ears. And although legal, the political
donations make a smelly policy even more malodorous.

YOU GET TO PICK NEW POSTAGE STAMP DESIGNS FOR THE '90S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Can we hit the hyperdrive and get into the next
millennium faster?
</P>
<P>
   The '90s have been a pathetic decade. Or so we gather from the
U.S. Postal Service whose greatest advance in the '90s was to give
us candidates for stamps to represent each decade of the century.
</P>
<P>
   For the '60s, the public voted for things like the Beatles,
Woodstock and the Barbie doll, even though it was invented in 1959.
The Postal Service didn't give us a chance to vote on any
assassinations or riots.
</P>
<P>
   For the '70s, the stamp that got the most votes was the yellow
smiley face _ enough said. For the '80s, the personal computer and
the fall of the Berlin Wall won big.
</P>
<P>
   Now we're back way below the level of the yellow smiley face,
which stayed around in the '90s to fill a vacuum of vacuity.
</P>
<P>
   That's how bland the '90s seem to be, at least to whoever at the
Postal Service picks the candidates for stamps of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   I believe this is what Cliff Clavin has been doing since
``Cheers'' shut down. Or maybe the '90s really have been incredibly
boring, even by post office standards.
</P>
<P>
   The envelope, please. The one with the stamps on it:
</P>
<P>
   To represent '90s people and events, you can choose between the
Gulf War, ``improving education,'' ``cultural diversity,''
``sustained economic growth,'' ``recovering species'' and ``active
older Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   They all sound like courses I don't want to take.
</P>
<P>
   You know when you have to put things in quotation marks they'll
be hard to illustrate. If you can't paint a picture of something
that fits on a stamp, like a peace symbol or a Roosevelt, you don't
really have a symbol.
</P>
<P>
   I guess for ``sustained economic growth'' you have a jagged
upward line on a graph that runs into a higher stamp price.
</P>
<P>
   How do you paint a picture of ``improving education,'' something
that hasn't happened in America anyway? More representative of the
'90s would be a picture of a metal detector.
</P>
<P>
   You can illustrate the Gulf War, but the laser-bomb cross hairs
might confuse people with the Balkans War, which may go on into the
2000s.
</P>
<P>
   For arts and entertainment, you can vote for ``Seinfeld,''
computer art or the movie ``Titanic.'' Never mind that we've
already forgotten ``Titanic'' and would confuse the stamp for one
representing the 1910s, a much more notable decade than this one.
</P>
<P>
   The sports category gives us junior golf. Michael Jordan or the
Bulls didn't make the cut.
</P>
<P>
   The science category includes virtual reality (how do you put
that on a stamp?) and ``return to space,'' which I guess would be
represented by a more wrinkly picture of John Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest advances in the '90s came in the burgeoning field of
lifestyle, and the Postal Service offers us stamps representing
cell phones, home offices, museum attendance, community service,
sports utility vehicles and ``the popularity of coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder coffee has been so popular. We needed something to
keep us awake in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee? Jerry Seinfeld? Museum attendance? Junior golf?
</P>
<P>
   These stamps representing contemporary American life give an
impression of passivity and boredom that is so overwhelming you
can't even use the word ``overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   You just feel, well, whelmed. It's a real word meaning
``submerged.''
</P>
<P>
   We're still submerged in the '90s and it's hard to know what
stamps will represent the decade. There are still eight months to
go and anything can happen.
</P>
<P>
   Please, something happen.
</P>
<P>
   What's happened so far? On-paper wealth, the caffe latte
industry, cell phones and SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones and SUVs are at least illustratable, but who wants
to see any more of them?
</P>
<P>
   ``The popularity of coffee'' could be represented by a Starbucks
logo, but friends won't let friends lick a Starbucks stamp.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we're too close to the '90s to find our symbols. I don't
think so. The following are my write-in candidates for stamps to
represent the '90s:
</P>
<P>
   There should be a ``.com'' stamp, even if it may spell .doom for
the Postal Service. You don't want to have specific .com stamps,
like Amazon.com, because such companies may have vanished by the
time the snail mail gets to its destination.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the .com stamp will be wildly overpriced.
</P>
<P>
   You want a symbol of the '90s? How about a stained blue dress
stamp _ self-adhesive, natch.
</P>
<P>
   If we must have an SUV stamp, why not kill two birds with one
stamp by making it a white Bronco?
</P>
<P>
   We definitely need a cruise missile stamp. It's the weapons
system and foreign policy of choice of the '90s. Unfortunately,
when your mail goes astray, it'll be way off target.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise missile is like the Postal Service that way. And boy,
did the Postal Service miss the '90s. I'm not sure I will.
</P>
<P>
   Send me your suggestions for stamps of the '90s, preferably by
e-mail at morseexaminer.com, where the Postal Service can't lose
them.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, how about a stamp saying, ``You've got mail''?

WHEN WORLDS OF CREATION AND DESTRUCTION COLLIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., N.J., Pa.)   (af)  
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   His diary entry for one day in 1898 read: ``Fired cannon, pop
and firecrackers all day. In evening had five sky rockets, three
Roman candles, one large pinwheel and a Japanese match which I
made.''
</P>
<P>
   The words were not those of a vengeful delinquent planning a
schoolyard massacre; they were written by a 15-year-old Robert
Hutchings Goddard, whose later inventions _ liquid rocket fuel,
multistage vehicles and rocket gyrostabilizers, among them _ opened
the way to space travel.
</P>
<P>
   One wonders what would have befallen space science if Goddard
and a host of youthful experimenters had been denied access to the
very things legislators and others these days are seeking to ban.
The fact is, many young people have been drawn to careers in
science and engineering partly by spectacular chemical reactions,
especially explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Recent school killings have prompted calls for banning almost
every potential weapon from flint knives to nuclear bombs. (Somehow
the automobile is never included.) But to ban all dangerous
substances would be a tall order.
</P>
<P>
   There has never been any lack of explosive materials, and
explosives have proliferated at a tremendous rate over the years. A
dictionary of explosives in 1900 contained 1,091 entries, whereas
the current tally of ``satisfactory'' explosives (according to an
expert at Los Alamos National Laboratory) is about 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who would favor outlawing all 20,000 of them if
it meant keeping children safe. But it's worth remembering that at
least some explosives are vital to modern civilization; explosives
are needed for mining, building roads, digging foundations, welding
pipelines and railroad tracks, actuating automobile air bags,
sending rockets to Mars and simulating conditions deep within the
atmospheres of giant planets, among countless other things.
</P>
<P>
   During my own childhood in the 1930s and 1940s, dangerous
chemicals including explosives and poisons were easy to come by,
and yet I cannot remember a single incident comparable to the
disaster in Littleton, Colo., and other recent killings.
</P>
<P>
   Not that kids didn't experiment and play dangerous tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Firearms and explosives (including fireworks) invite mischief,
but in the past it was usually of a fairly harmless kind. Farm
children of a more relaxed generation than the present one used to
annoy dairymen by detonating sticks of dynamite under empty
20-gallon milk cans, sending the cans sailing into the sky.
</P>
<P>
   College students delighted in flushing lighted firecrackers down
dormitory toilets, causing fountains to erupt from toilets on lower
floors. Mild but startling explosions caused by ammonia-moistened
iodine crystals scattered around lab benches enlivened many a
chemistry class.
</P>
<P>
   Recreational explosions are not necessarily dangerous. Since
1912, the Conestoga Co. of Bethlehem, Pa., has been making and
selling acetylene cannons that delight children with satisfying
bangs free of any risk of injury.
</P>
<P>
   But fireworks containing explosive or propellant charges are not
harmless; every year children lose fingers or eyes by holding
lighted firecrackers or rockets. Moreover, fireworks can be put to
criminal purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the pipe bombs that have figured in recent terror
incidents have been filled with aluminum powder and oxidizers
extracted from ordinary firecrackers.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, people are eager to prevent massacres. The response
has been an effort to prevent the trafficking in explosives and
guns, and to somehow reprogram children with violent proclivities.
</P>
<P>
   Fireworks are banned (or limited to relatively innocuous
pyrotechnic products like sparklers) in 16 states, and each year
sees new legislation to prevent substances like ammonium nitrate
fertilizer from falling into felonious hands.

 UNDATED: felonious hands.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sale of old-fashioned black powder, the propellant needed
for firing antique weapons, has been sharply curtailed because it
has been used in homemade bombs.
</P>
<P>
   As the trend continues, government agencies have also
constrained the sale of chemicals so tightly that it is difficult
or impossible for most young students to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1957, when it moved to New Jersey to provide chemicals and
apparatus exclusively to manufacturers, the Ace Scientific Supply
Co. in New York City, used to count many neighborhood high school
students among its customers. A thicket of regulations eventually
blocked such sales, but the company's president, Robert L.
Lowenstein, remembered his student customers fondly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of those young customers made important contributions to
science and are now research directors,'' Lowenstein said. ``I wish
something could be done to make chemicals and apparatus more
available to students, but I can't see any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar regrets are often expressed by older teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Weitzman, a professor of biochemistry at the
University of Bath, England, wrote in the New Scientist nearly two
decades ago that although he had accepted the chairmanship of his
university's safety panel, the reduction of laboratory risks had
had its down side.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the laboratories, we forbid this, don't allow that, and
prevent the other ... and we're all safer and less at risk of harm
and hazard. Most commendable,'' he wrote. ``But have we, at the
same time, removed some of the fun and excitement of laboratory
life, the thrill of experimenting with the unknown?''
</P>
<P>
   Weitzman described some of the risky experiments and procedures
once common in student laboratories, including a very hazardous
method for cleaning flasks by filling them with an explosive
mixture of nitric acid and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``These encounters conveyed a sense of intimacy with one's
chemical materials,'' he wrote. ``One saw reagents and reactions at
their most angry and violent and, having done so, one learnt to
tame them and discipline them to do one's own bidding.''
</P>
<P>
   He concluded that ``perhaps just a little bit of danger might
bring a lot more fun and lead to more insight and understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Banning several thousand chemicals as well as timers, pipes,
epoxy glue and other items that can be combined as bombs would be
one approach to denying bombs to potential criminals. Another would
be the reprogramming of violence-prone people to eliminate
aggressive impulses; it might be done with psychotherapy, chemical
castration or brain surgery.
</P>
<P>
   By selective breeding or gene manipulation, traits associated
with aggressive behavior and the creation of sociopaths might be
reduced throughout the world, spawning the most well-behaved human
race the world has ever seen. A similar result has been achieved in
Siberia, where fur breeders have invented a completely docile breed
of silver fox _ one that licks its keepers' faces while being
prepared for slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   But must we really squelch all the things that can contribute to
anti-social behavior to protect ourselves from a handful of
sociopaths?
</P>
<P>
   Could an aggression-free race produce a Jefferson or Beethoven
or Einstein? As we race to eliminate aggressors and their weapons,
should we not take care to avoid throwing out the baby with the
bath water?

THE SEED POLICE ARE WATCHING FARMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEN ALEXANDER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The wagon train plods slowly, resolutely across
the untamed West.
</P>
<P>
   The camera focuses on faces of the sturdy, clear-eyed pioneers,
Ma and Pa Suggs, as they look ahead toward a future on this rich,
unbroken soil. It will yield bounteous crops thanks to diligent,
unstinting labor _ and a carefully preserved supply of seed grain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ma, I know our food's runnin' low and we may have to live on
jackrabbit stew but don't go touchin' none of our seed corn. That
there corn'll make a future for Billy and Sarah and their youngun's
on down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Had there been a Monsanto Corporation back then, chances are
that a rider would have galloped up and called out, ``Hold on
there, Sugqs. You plant that there seed corn that you collected
from your last crop back in Illinois, my company will slap you with
the gol-durndest lawsuit you ever heard of.''
</P>
<P>
   See, Farmer Suggs may have planted genetically engineered seed
developed by Monsanto or some other giant biotech company, seed
which, thanks to a 1980s U.S. Supreme Court decision, is considered
``intellectual property'' and, as such, may be patented.
</P>
<P>
   Ergo, you may buy seed for ONE planting. And if you save any of
that crop as seed for next year's crop, you're stealing Monsanto's
intellectual property and are subject to a royalty claim, plus
havinq your farm inspected for the next five years to make sure
you're not reprising this dastardly crime.
</P>
<P>
   Genetically engineered seeds are not like hybrid seeds, the
latter being incapable of self-reproduction. I know this because I
grow a small patch of corn in my California back yard in Lafayette.
Each year I buy about $3 worth of hybrid, super-sweet corn seeds
which produce around 300 ears of incredibly sweet, tender corn,
enough to pass out to favored friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   I shred and plow in the stalks, as all good greenies do, and
invariably an unpicked ear will be in the ground and pop up the
following year. I've left one or two of these to develop and the
resulting plant is a goofy mutant, all tassel and leaves and no
ears.
</P>
<P>
   Genetically engineered seeds can happily reproduce themselves,
hence Monsanto's litigious posture: We can't have farmers not
buying our seed every year and affecting our bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Not content with waving subpoenas around, the biotech biggies
have developed a new genetically engineered strain of seeds that
kill themselves after one sprouting. This is known as Terminator
Technology, a wrinkle that many geneticists worry can spread to
other, untreated seeds and render them suicidal too.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto pooh-poohs such fears, but there is a growinq movement,
especially in Third World countries, to bar the sale of such
self-eliminating stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know that Monsanto also makes Roundup, the popular weed
killer? In yet another bottom line booster, they've managed to
introduce a Roundup-immune gene into their seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the scenario: Use their immune seeds, the plants grow and
the grower can spray the whole field willy-nilly, killing weeds
without killing the crop. It's a double-barreled profit maker: Sell
non-reproducing seeds and sell lots more Roundup (if you use the
stuff, you know how expensive it is).
</P>
<P>
   Unless some spoilsport ecologists manage to get some new laws
passed or undo some old ones, the future looks immutably rosy for
those who would control the world's agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   No more self-sufficient Farmer Suggses who can better their lot
by enough hard work; any increase in production is eaten up by
having to buy patented seeds every year.
</P>
<P>
   If some poor boob happens to replant from his own crop, it's off
to the courtroom or into the slammer. Then if the boob, having
learned his lesson, decides the only way to get ahead is to plant
his suicidal seeds intensively, he'll need gobs of Roundup to keep
those little sprouts from being crowded out by the weeds. It's a
win-win situation, or a lose-lose situation, depending on whose
side you're on.

MANY TOP RODEO COMPETITORS MAKING THEIR HOME ON THE RANGE IN
STEPHENVILLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT HOFFMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STEPHENVILLE, Texas _ On a cool, misty but sunny morning, Ty
Murray began his day at 7:30, punching cattle on his 1,851-acre
ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Within two hours, Murray, a seven-time winner of rodeo's world
all-around title, has doctored a sick mother cow and has moved a
bawling herd of cattle from one pasture to another.
</P>
<P>
   He relishes the rural life near Stephenville, where he and
two-time world bull riding champion Jim Sharp moved nine years ago.
What Murray and Sharp started has become a stampede of rodeo
competitors heading to this town of 14,400.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five years, 10 world-class competitors _ bull riders
Troy Dunn, Tuff Hedeman, Gilbert Carrillo and Adam Carrillo, barrel
racers Cheyenne Wimberly and Charmayne James, calf roper Cody Ohl,
team ropers Martin Lucero and Steve Northcott and saddle-bronc
rider Tom Reeves _ have moved in. The rodeo competitors cite many
factors, including relatively cheap land, a central location on the
North American rodeo circuit, the abundance of Texas rodeos nearby
and the proximity to Dallas/Fort Worth Airport and their traveling
companions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the rural, agricultural atmosphere,'' Murray said.
``With all of the traveling that we do, it would be handier to live
five minutes from D/FW Airport instead of 1 1/2 hours away. But it
wouldn't be worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray owns a secluded ranch that offers a picturesque backdrop
of brownish-white rocky soil, and lush, wooded rolling hills dotted
with stock ponds and winding creeks. His state-of-the-art gray
stone-brick home overlooks a vast range.
</P>
<P>
   Like Murray, Dunn owns a lush cattle ranch. But it's thousands
of miles away, near the Great Barrier Reef on his native
Australia's East Coast. But he makes his fortune on the North
American bull riding circuit _ he won $221,791 last year _ and
savors a simple home life near Stephenville.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said he acquired a three-bedroom country home and two acres
for $76,000 and might have paid twice as much for a home close to
Fort Worth. And he's just down the road from Ohl, the two-time
world calf roping champion, and within 20 minutes of Hedeman,
Murray and Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got tired of living in apartments, and we looked for land
near Fort Worth, but it was too bloody expensive,'' Dunn said. ``So
we looked around Decatur and Bowie, but not many of our closest
friends lived there. But in Stephenville, I've got a lot of mates
like Ty, Tuff and Jim.''
</P>
<P>
   With an abundance of cowboys parading their big belt buckles
around town, the coffee-shop chatter in Stephenville often consists
of two thoroughly Texas topics: football and rodeo. First, there's
the latest news on the town's high school football program, which
has won three state titles in the past six years. Then the
conversation shifts to the latest feats of Stephenville's extensive
roster of rodeo athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenville's square is crowned with a stone courthouse
surrounded by signs touting the town's success in football and
rodeo. On the square's northwest corner, the bios of 14 rodeo and
horse show stars, including Murray and Hedeman, are embedded in the
concrete area dubbed the Cowboy Capital Walk of Fame, which was
dedicated in November.
</P>
<P>
   Erath County's claim as rodeo's Grand Central Station stems from
the 1940s, when stock contractor Everett Colburn took a group of
cowboys by train from Dublin (also in Erath County) to New York for
the sport's then-premier rodeo, at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Colburn and his partner, the late actor Gene Autry, built a
bowl-shaped arena in Dublin and produced rodeos. That in turn
influenced many stars, including bucking stock rider Harry
Tompkins, who moved to the area in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Tarleton State University established a successful
rodeo team. Tarleton's men (1967) and women (1969, '70 and '71) won
national college rodeo championships soon after and remain
competitive. Both teams qualified this weekend to advance to next
month's College National Finals Rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look around town today, it seems like almost everyone
has a horse,'' said rodeo livestock owner Terry Walls, who competed
on the 1967 men's team and raises rodeo livestock on his 350-acre
ranch seven miles north of town. ``A lot of people who rodeoed at
Tarleton have stayed here and gone into business.''
</P>
<P>
   And more and more rodeo competitors are joining them in
Stephenville.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's laid back here, and people don't hound you for
autographs,'' Gilbert Carrillo said. ``They're used to bumping into
name cowboys because Stephenville is the cowboy capital of the
world.''

<P>
   SIERRA VISTA, Ariz. _ From a bird's-eye view, it is easy to see
why the upper San Pedro River in southeastern Arizona is such an
enticing rest stop. Surrounded by barren brown desert for as far as
the eye can see, the river sticks out along the Mexican border like
a big green sign on a long, lonely stretch of western highway
saying: Gas, Food, Lodging.
</P>
<P>
   The San Pedro River, which flows from Mexico into Arizona 75
miles southeast of Tucson, is a rare breed in the American
Southwest: a free-flowing river with a healthy forest of willow,
cottonwood, and other trees, shrubs and grasses, which harbor a
banquet of insects for hungry birds.
</P>
<P>
   Each spring, up to four million migrating warblers, vireos, and
other songbirds stop to rest and refuel here on their way from
winter roosts in Mexico and Central America to summer nesting
grounds in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Around 400 species of birds, nearly two-thirds of the kinds of
birds seen in North America, have been observed here, and 220
species breed along the river. The river is also at the
northernmost tip of the range of green kingfishers, gray hawks, and
other birds rarely seen in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes the upper San Pedro River one of the top
spots in the country for bird-watching.
</P>
<P>
   But the San Pedro River is in danger of drying up because
groundwater pumping for urban development and farms is draining the
river. And saving this ``extraordinary biological treasure chest,''
as an international panel of experts called the river habitat in a
report last November, has become a test case for an effort under
the North American Free Trade Agreement to save an ecosystem shared
by the United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Next month the governing board of the Commission for
Environmental Cooperation, which was created as part of the
environmental side agreement to NAFTA, will consider the advisory
panel's recommendations for ways to save the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take the San Pedro out, you are jeopardizing a
hemisphere's bird populations,'' said Paul Hardy, program manager
for the Nature Conservancy on the upper San Pedro River, and a
member of the advisory panel. ``It would be like trying to drive
cross country if you took out all the gas stations and
restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   Many migratory birds funnel through the upper San Pedro River
because riparian forests on other rivers in the Southwest, like the
Rio Grande and the Colorado River, largely disappeared when the
rivers were dammed and natural water flows were disrupted, Hardy
explained.
</P>
<P>
   The San Pedro River sustains the largest surviving expanse of
broadleaf riparian forest in the Southwest. Even in the driest
spells, there is water in most of a 50-mile-long stretch of river
that straddles the border.
</P>
<P>
   This upper section of the San Pedro River is kept alive by a
vast underground aquifer that is estimated to contain more water
than the combined capacity of the Lake Mead and Lake Powell
reservoirs on the Colorado River. But this abundance is both a
blessing and a curse.
</P>
<P>
   The river depends on water that seeps into the river bed from
the aquifer. But the high water table also means pumping is cheap
and easy. And in Arizona, it is unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, Sierra Vista and the neighboring Fort Huachuca
Army base, as well as farms and small towns on both sides of the
border, have been pumping more water than is replenished by
rainfall. The pumping has created what hydrologists call a ``cone
of depression'' in the aquifer, which is much like the vortex in a
drain.
</P>
<P>
   It draws water from the surrounding area into the main well
fields that supply the city and Army base. The outer edge of that
cone of depression is now beginning to suck water from the San
Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   If the trend continues at the current rate, with an overdraft of
7,000 acre-feet (2.3 billion gallons) of water a year, the
stretches of the river that have previously run all year will go
dry in spring and early summer, when migratory birds visit.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some cottonwood and willow trees are already showing signs of
stress with roots stranded in dry ground in the summer, according
to research by Dr. Julie Stromberg, a University of Arizona
hydrologist and a member of the study team. If the groundwater
drops another three feet, which is expected to happen in some
stretches over the next decade, Dr. Stromberg predicted, half of
the riparian forest will die.
</P>
<P>
   In order to keep the San Pedro flowing, the advisory panel
recommended conservation and groundwater recharge projects that
included buying land and conservation easements to restrict
groundwater pumping and housing subdivisions.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, roughly 40 miles on the United States side of the
San Pedro was made into the first riparian national conservation
area managed by the Department of Interior's Bureau of Land of
Management. The government bought 56,000 acres of farmland and
stopped pumping irrigation water.
</P>
<P>
   A moratorium on cattle grazing led to rapid recovery of the
understory riparian forest. Songbird populations doubled and
tripled, bureau biologists said. The endangered southwestern willow
flycatcher returned to the area although it has yet to nest.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, two beavers were released on the river in the hope
that they would build dams that create the marshy willow thickets
that the flycatchers prefer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have really seen a beautiful change in the river,'' said
Bill Childress, manager of the San Pedro Riparian National
Conservation Area. ``A lot of things are headed in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The bureau recently spent $250,000 to finish fencing the
conservation area to keep cattle away. Local governments plan to
spend $407,000 over the next year on conservation and groundwater
recharge projects. But even if all of the projects are successful,
the numbers still do not add up. The groundwater deficit will
continue to worsen, the panel says.
</P>
<P>
   With loss of habitat all but inevitable on the United States
side, the experts concluded that the best hope for maintaining
viable habitat was to extend the conservation area upriver and into
Mexico. That kind of explicit trade-off was not well-received in
Mexico, said Dr. Hector Arias-Rojo, a hydrologist with the
Institute for the Environment and Sustainable Development of the
State of Sonora, and the only Mexican member of the expert team.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory panel ultimately agreed that Mexico should not be
called on to solve a problem created in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the idea of extending the protected area south is
slowly taking hold. Arias-Rojo is part of a team of scientists,
coordinated by the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which
is using the upper San Pedro River basin as a case study of
desertification. And this summer, Arias-Rojo will be setting up
bird monitoring programs in Mexico, with help from Bureau of Land
Management biologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no mechanism right now'' for a border-spanning
conservation project, Arias-Rojo said. ``However, we are building
the bridge.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Looking out of the mist-covered window of his fourth
floor office at Tufts-New England Medical Center here, Dr. Allen C.
Steere inspected the urban sky on a warm spring day not long ago.
``More ticks,'' he warned gravely. ``If you have a mild winter and
a warm, wet spring, those are good tick conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   More ticks means more Lyme disease, which Steere has been
studying for 24 years, longer than anyone else. In fact, he was the
first to identify the brand new ailment among a baffling cluster of
children with swollen knees in Lyme, Conn. And, over the protests
of civic leaders, he gave it its name.
</P>
<P>
   But more recently he has enraged many patients and their doctors
with his contention that Lyme disease has become a junk-drawer
diagnosis, covering maladies ranging from fibromyalgia to
hypochondria. Many people receiving antibiotic treatment, he
argued, are being done more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose Lyme disease is one of the few diseases that some
people want to have because it's defined.'' Steere said. ``I think
it's very difficult to have something that is not well
understood.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the realm of Lyme disease, few are as influential as
Steere.
</P>
<P>
   As chief of the rheumatology and immunology department at Tufts
School of Medicine, Steere led the research effort on Lymerix, the
preventive Lyme vaccine, which first hit the market in January. The
research took four years, covered 10 states and involved 11,000
patients and 31 scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine proved 78 percent effective. But its impact is not
likely to be felt during this summer's tick onslaught. For fullest
protection, the drug is taken in three shots administered over the
course of a year, according to the manufacturer, SmithKline
Beecham.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, some uncertainty remains about the vaccine's
ultimate safety, especially for people with certain conditions.
When the National Vaccine Advisory Committee of the Food and Drug
Administration certified the drug in December for people 16 to 70
years old, members appended a list of concerns about the long-term
effect of the vaccine, especially among those with chronic
arthritis or heart conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rare that a vaccine is voted on with such ambivalence and
such a stack of provisos,'' Dr. Patricia L. Ferrieri, the committee
chairwoman and a professor at the University of Minnesota Medical
School, said at the time of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Lyme problem nationally, the FDA released the vaccine
on public health grounds, recommending that it be considered by
people at the highest risk for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Even Steere has his doubts about the safety of the vaccine,
which he has not taken himself, he said, because Lyme is not a
serious problem in the Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1982, 128,327 cases of Lyme disease have been reported to
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but the number may
be much higher. Dr. David Dennis, who coordinates the agency's Lyme
program, says he believes that only a third of the cases are
reported.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, his final year of medical school at Columbia College of
Physicians and Surgeons, Steere learned epidemiology, as a dodge,
after hearing from an Army recruiter that some 90 percent of new
doctors would be drafted and shipped out to Southeast Asia, unless
they found alternative service. Steere discovered the Epidemic
Intelligence Service, the CDC division that investigates outbreaks
of new diseases, like AIDS and Legionnaires' disease. From 1973 to
1975, he practiced the science of epidemiology across America.
Afterward, he headed for Connecticut to begin a fellowship at Yale
in his passion, rheumatology. ``I hoped that my CDC experiences
were something I could apply to the study of arthritis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His opportunity came four months later with a call from
Connecticut's chief epidemiologist, who asked Steere to visit a
concerned woman in Lyme, a tiny, wooded hamlet at the mouth of the
Connecticut River. The woman, Polly Murray, was reporting an
unusual cluster of a rare disease, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis,
in her town. Victims included two of her four children, whose knees
were so swollen that they could not walk without crutches. Steere's
interest was piqued. ``If there was one child in a town the size of
Lyme,'' he said, ``that's about what you might expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Murray handed Steere a list of dozens of ailing children.
He began by calling each family and eventually compiled a list of
39 children. Then came the time-consuming effort to learn what they
had in common.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents blamed a new nuclear power plant upriver; some
suspected the drinking water or the local swimming pool or
something they had all eaten; others feared the disease was
communicable. The suppositions all had to be ruled out, one at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   Steere soon developed an insect theory, based upon the
observation that symptoms seemed to begin in the summer or fall.
But only a quarter of the children remembered being bitten, and
each described the bite differently. Nobody saw an insect.
</P>
<P>
   Two years would pass before Steere and his colleagues put in
place the last piece of the puzzle, and it came to them by
coincidence, when an ecologist walked into Steere's office with a
vial containing a tick he said had bitten him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about this size,'' said Steere, seizing a pen and
drawing the dimmest mark on a piece of paper. It turned out to be a
nymphal Ixodes scapularis tick, a nearly invisible black-legged
newcomer to the region carried on the backs of deer and field mice.
</P>
<P>
   Local insect census takers were tracking the tick's march across
Connecticut. Laying their surveillance maps over Steere's maps for
juvenile rheumatoid arthritis produced an exact geographical match.
</P>
<P>
   For this breakthrough work, Steere has been widely heralded. At
a ceremony in Hartford last year, Gov. John Rowland proclaimed
Sept. 24 as Allen C. Steere Day.
</P>
<P>
   But the adulation was short-lived. In the early '90s, Steere he
began to hypothesize that many people complaining of Lyme disease
symptoms did not, in fact, have the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The Journal of the American Medical Association in
1993, Steere said the disease was overdiagnosed and overtreated _ a
statement that balkanized groups of sufferers, scientists and
clinicians into squabbling factions.
</P>
<P>
   In one group is the American Lyme Disease Foundation, mostly
representing researchers, including Steere; in the other is the
Lyme Disease Foundation, mostly representing clinicians and
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Their chief discord is over the possibility that Lyme disease,
in some patients, develops into a chronic disease requiring massive
doses of antibiotics over long periods of time, as some doctors
believe.
</P>
<P>
   Steere thinks not. Instead, he argues that persisting symptoms
may be owing to something he calls ``post-Lyme syndrome,''
undefined and untreatable neurological damage resulting from the
initial infection.
</P>
<P>
   A year-old National Institutes of Health study to try to resolve
the dispute is continuing. Meanwhile, as a result of Steere's
influence, insurance companies have sometimes refused to pay for
continuing treatments. This, in turn, has provoked patients to
heckle and even picket Steere.
</P>

   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Lyme Disease Foundation has condemned him as dismissive of
patients' complaints. So has Polly Murray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am dismayed about Dr. Steere's position,'' said Mrs. Murray,
who wrote of her struggle with the disease in ``The Widening
Circle'' (St. Martin's Press, 1996). ``He feels that it's
overdiagnosed and overtreated, but I see people in the area who are
having a real struggle with getting over Lyme disease. And some of
them have responded to longer-term treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   To patients with Lyme disease perhaps Steere's most audacious
gesture came in 1994 when he testified at a board of medicine
hearing against Dr. Joseph Natole of Saginaw, Mich., who was
treating patients for chronic Lyme disease. Because Natole had so
many people on intravenous antibiotics, authorities charged him
with medical malpractice and insurance fraud. Natole was ultimately
stripped of his medical license for six months.
</P>
<P>
   Pointedly, Steere expressed no regret for his role in the case.
In his experience, he said, these persistent health complaints
``are not best handled in the long run with chronic antibiotic
therapy.'' ``And for that opinion,'' he added, ``I have been
pilloried by certain groups. But it's still my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   And he vowed to stick by that opinion.

FORD FACES HUGE STAKES IN CALIFORNIA LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SETH ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ In the largest class-action lawsuit to go to
trial against an automaker in American history, the Ford Motor Co.
is accused of fraudulently covering up a potentially dangerous
stalling problem in 22 million cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action lawsuit, set for trial May 11 in Alameda County
Superior Court, contends that Ford withheld information about a
defective ignition module from federal regulators and the public.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks more than $3 billion in damages, about 1.5
percent of Ford's worldwide revenues for 1998. Ford faces
additional potential damages in five companion lawsuits filed on
behalf of another 27 million past or present Ford owners in other
states. Those cases are on hold while the case in Oakland is
pending.
</P>
<P>
   The case pits the nation's second largest automaker against an
unusual team: the San Francisco law firm of Hancock, Rothert &AMP;
Bunshoft, which is best known for insurance coverage work; and
Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety, a
Washington, D.C., nonprofit organization started in the 1970s by
Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has denied the allegations and says that while some earlier
cars had flawed modules, it offered to fix them in the worst cases
and improved them in later cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no safety defect in any of those modules,'' said Don
Lough, one of Ford's lawyers. ``These vehicles were not having
accidents or stalling at any higher rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Key evidence includes internal Ford documents describing
problems with the Thick Film Ignition (TFI) module. One 1983 report
on intermittent TFI failures warned: ``Safety is affected.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was brought on behalf of more than 3 million
Californians who own or owned 1983 to 1995 model Ford cars and
trucks with TFI modules mounted on the distributor.
</P>
<P>
   The module switches electric current to the coil, sending a
spark to the distributor, which directs it to the spark plugs,
igniting the air-fuel mixture in the engine cylinders. The
rectangular device consists of a power transistor and integrated
circuit inside a plastic cover on a metal base meant to disperse
heat.
</P>
<P>
   Ford mounted the module on the distributor, one of the hottest
places under the hood, in all 1983 to 1987 cars and light trucks,
and in some other vehicles up to 1995. Ford says it was put there
to ease assembly and boost reliability.
</P>
<P>
   But the complaint says that Ford knew no later than 1985 that
placing the module on the distributor exposed it to unsafe
temperatures that could make the module fail, resulting in possible
stalls, loss of control and ``risk of serious personal injury and
death.'' It says that failures can be intermittent and hard to
detect.
</P>
<P>
   Ford could have mounted the TFI module away from the engine
block for just $7.75 a vehicle, the complaint says.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the company sold millions of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury
vehicles with defective distributor-mounted modules, even as it
advertised that ``Quality is Job One,'' the complaint says.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Ford Motor Co. said there was no hazard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that there never was a massive stalling
problem,'' said a brief filed by Richard C. Warmer of the San
Francisco office of O'Melveny and Myers. He called the coverup
charge preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a barrage of pretrial motions and appeals to the state
Supreme Court, Ford has failed to get the suit dismissed. The
company was hit with almost $100,000 in sanctions for improperly
trying to consolidate the six cases in federal court in Michigan,
where Ford is based.
</P>
<P>
   ``In essence, each distributor-mounted TFI module is a potential
time bomb,'' Ditlow said. ``Ford has needlessly endangered the
lives of millions of consumers and has cost them millions of
dollars in expenditures by concealing a design defect.''
</P>
<P>
   Lough countered that about 16 million cars covered by the
lawsuit are still on the road. ``If there was a safety defect in
those cars, there is no way Ford could have hid it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The suit has drawn special notice because of the legal theories
behind it, which the plaintiffs' lawyers say could help hold
corporations more accountable and which defense lawyers say could
start a flood of new class-action suits.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of claiming that each car in the class actually stalled
or caused an injury, the suit contends Ford violated California
consumer protection laws by misleading the public, the press and
regulators about the module's unusual propensity to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than seek personal injury damages, the suit demands that
Ford give up profits it gained by allegedly covering up the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also seeks statutory and punitive damages, and either
an order that Ford replace the modules or pay compensatory damages
of $250 to each class member.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has ridiculed the suit as a ``no injury'' class action.
</P>
<P>
   In what appears to be the first ruling of its kind, Alameda
Superior Court Judge Michael E. Ballachey has interpreted the
California Legal Remedies Act as allowing a $1,000 fine against
Ford for each of the 3.1 million people the jury finds the company
defrauded _ potentially $3.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ballachey also has ruled that _ if the jury finds Ford liable _
he is willing to become the nation's first judge to use court
powers to order a vehicle recall.
</P>
<P>
   The California Manufacturers Association, the California Chamber
of Commerce and the Product Liability Advisory Council _ which
together represent more than 800 corporations _ sought to file
appeal briefs supporting Ford's effort to dissolve the class
action. However, the state appeals court declined to review the
briefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The novel and extraordinary class action theory ... in this
case is a recipe for disaster,'' said one brief, saying that
class-action lawsuits based on ``latent defects'' will have an
``extremely harmful effect ... on commerce in California and
throughout the country.''

   Harvesting Proteins
</P>
<P>
   Through genetic engineering, plants can become living drug
factories, producing antibodies and other proteins for use in
pharmaceuticals. But the difficulties and costs involved in
extracting and purifying these proteins from plant tissue has
prevented the process from being adopted on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from Rutgers University have developed a different
way of getting recombinant proteins from a plant: out through the
roots. By growing plants in a hydroponic, or water-based, medium
rather than soil, it may be possible to harvest the proteins simply
and continuously as they are secreted.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who described their work in the current issue
of the journal Nature Biotechnology, introduced DNA for producing
three kinds of foreign proteins into tobacco plants. Fused to the
DNA were ``endoplasmic reticulum targeting signals,'' molecular
chains designed to trick the plant into routing the proteins into
its secretory system. The resulting plants secreted large amounts
of the proteins through their roots. In plants that lacked the
targeting signals, the compounds remained in the root cells.

   The researchers noted that the process, which they call
rhizosecretion, can be optimized to produce even larger amounts of
proteins than shown in their studies. The process should also cut
down on the purification process, which contributes substantially
to the cost of producing such proteins. Plants secrete relatively
few proteins from their roots, so separating the desired protein
from the others in the hydroponic solution should be less of a
chore.

<P>
   Not-So-Graceful Sauropods
</P>
<P>
   Sauropod dinosaurs have been depicted as the giraffes of the
prehistoric world, holding their long necks in a swanlike curve to
browse the treetops for food. Experts have often wondered how the
circulatory systems of such dinosaurs could pump blood up to the
elevated head, with some suggesting that they must have had
multiple hearts to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   But now researchers have determined that sauropods probably
didn't have such a haughty posture after all. In fact, the
researchers report in the current issue of Science, the dinosaurs'
necks _ which reached lengths of up to 40 feet _ were practically
straight, sloping gently downward. Rather than dining in the trees,
the sauropods probably grazed along or near the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Fossilized bones being too heavy and fragile to manipulate, the
researchers, from Northern Illinois University and the University
of Oregon, used the next best thing: a computer model.
Specifically, they developed software to simulate the neck
structure and motion of two species of sauropods, diplodocus and
apatosaurus (which used to be known as brontosaurus).
</P>
<P>
   These ``virtual necks,'' when manipulated by computer, showed
that sauropods were a lot less limber than previously thought.
Diplodocus, in particular, could barely raise its head higher than
its back.
</P>
<P>
   Volcano in the Sea
</P>
<P>
   Scientists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution have
discovered a major underwater volcano near the Samoa Islands that
rises more than 14,000 feet from the ocean floor. It is as if Mount
Whitney, the highest peak in the 48 states, had been plopped down
in the middle of the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The location of the volcano had been predicted from a series of
earthquakes in the region in 1995. But maps of the sea floor near
the island chain, created using altimetry data from satellites,
showed only a small hill-like feature. The scientists made a more
detailed bottom survey from a research ship that revealed the
volcano's true size: about 22 miles across at the base, and rising
to within 2,000 feet of the surface. The top is marked by a
circular caldera that is about a mile across and 1,300 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery lends credence to the idea that the Samoa Islands
are, like the Hawaiian Islands, a ``hot spot'' chain, formed as
part of the earth's crust slowly migrates across a fixed hot spot,
or plume of magma rising through the mantle. The newly discovered
volcano, which the scientists named Fa'afafine, is at the far
eastern end of the Samoa Island chain, and probably represents the
current location of the hot spot.

SLEEPY TEEN-AGERS

<P>
   Q. (italics)Why do so many teen-agers have trouble waking up in
the morning? Is there any way to train yourself to make getting up
at 7 a.m. easier?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Morning sleepiness in teen-agers (or in anyone else) may have
a cause as simple as lack of sleep, perhaps because of too much
homework after a part-time job, followed by television. In that
case the cure may be to sleep more, cut down on some sleep-robbing
activities and gradually change bedtime and waking time in
15-minute increments until the person wakes refreshed at a
desirable time.
</P>
<P>
   However, some researchers suggest that there may be
physiological causes for drowsiness in teen-agers, not just in the
morning but in afternoon classes, and some even say that teen-agers
have a natural sleep pattern that would make them go to bed at 2
a.m. and stay in bed until noon.
</P>
<P>
   They base these suggestions on laboratory studies of rising and
falling levels of the hormone melatonin, which is involved in sleep
regulation, and on comparisons of the academic performance of
teen-agers with early and late school starting times.
</P>
<P>
   In one study, some of the students in an early-starting group
built up a sleep debt and suffered 10-second micro-naps of
drowsiness and lapsed attention in the afternoon.

 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In his blue jeans and T-shirt, walking laps around
the corridors at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, Joe Senatore
could almost be mistaken for a visitor rather than a patient. What
gives him away is the pole he wheels alongside him, hung with
pouches of medication trailing intravenous lines that tether him to
the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Senatore, who is 48, once drove a truck for a living. He is
cheerful and strongly built, with just a bit of gray in his hair,
and it is hard to believe that without the medication, he would not
be able to stroll the hallways, and would probably have trouble
breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, when he was only 36, Senatore suffered a
severe heart attack at his home in Bayshore, N.Y. One of his
coronary arteries, the vessels that carry blood to nourish the
heart, became completely blocked by cholesterol deposits. His heart
stopped beating, but doctors shocked him back to life and later did
a procedure to reopen the blocked artery. But the attack had
damaged muscle in the main pumping chamber of his heart, the left
ventricle.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years he was tiring easily and had trouble catching
his breath. He had developed congestive heart failure, a severe
condition that is an increasing cause of death and disability in
the United States _ and the only form of heart disease that is on
the rise.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the epidemic of congestive heart failure is a sign of
progress, evidence of advances in saving the lives of heart attack
victims and people with other heart problems. But these survivors
are often left with weakened hearts that cannot keep up with the
body's needs. As a result, fluid collects in the abdomen and lungs,
and sometimes in the feet and legs, causing fatigue, swelling and
shortness of breath. Low blood flow may also damage other organs,
especially the kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   The symptoms can be treated with drugs: diuretics to help the
kidneys excrete extra water, and digitalis and other medications to
strengthen the heartbeat and normalize rhythm. But for Senatore, as
for many patients, the drugs gradually lose power. This year he
could barely walk from his car to the soccer field to watch his
children play. Periodically, fluid would fill his lungs, sending
him to the emergency room gasping for air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was drowning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, he would stay in the hospital for a few days of
treatment with strong intravenous drugs. But with each episode it
became more difficult to replace them with pills so he could go
home. By the last week of April, Senatore had been at Mount Sinai
for a month, on the waiting list for a heart transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Senatore, who has a teen-age son and daughter, hopes to recover
enough to go home for a while. ``The doctor would rather I stay,
but this is the season for graduations and recitals and soccer
games,'' he said. On the other hand, he said, ``I don't want to
come back in here on a stretcher, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone else on the transplant list can tell a similar
tale of progressive disability from congestive heart failure, of
trying to buy time as drugs stop working.
</P>
<P>
   About 4.9 million Americans have heart failure, and a million of
them, like Senatore, are under the age of 60. Every year, 400,000
new cases are diagnosed, and the condition leads to more than
800,000 hospital stays, including many repeat visits. Congestive
heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization in the
elderly, and hospital bills accounted for much of the $18.8 billion
spent on the disease in 1998. Health experts say the problem is
getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   Because doctors can now save many heart attack victims who
probably would have died in the past, and because Americans are
living longer, more and more are surviving long enough for heart
failure to catch up with them. In that sense, the epidemic is
really a shift in causes of death or, as Dr. Valentin Fuster,
president of the American Heart Association calls it, ``the price
of success.''
</P>
<P>
   Other conditions, in addition to heart attack, can lead to heart
failure. Three-quarters of patients have high blood pressure, and
some have diseased heart valves. Both conditions make the heart
work harder, which can eventually weaken it. Clogged arteries in
the heart and elsewhere are also risk factors, and so are diabetes,
alcoholism and chronic lung diseases like emphysema. Less common
causes include genetic disorders, chemotherapy for cancer and viral
and other infections.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could prevent coronary disease, we might prevent heart
failure,'' said Dr. Michael Domanski, head of the clinical trials
group at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. But that
would mean persuading people to control their cholesterol, blood
pressure and diabetes, and to exercise more and smoke less _ advice
that many Americans ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Once the heart is injured, it tries to compensate. Healthy cells
try to do the work of damaged ones, changing their metabolism and
growing larger. Often, the entire heart gradually enlarges and
changes shape, a process known as remodeling. But the oversized,
misshapen heart cannot pump blood efficiently, and the struggle may
turn into a vicious cycle of deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   If a healthy heart and one that had reached the final stage of
heart failure were placed side by side, anyone could tell the
difference, according to Dr. Alan Gass, director of transplant
cardiology at Mount Sinai.
</P>
<P>
   ``The normal one will look small, the size of a fist, and kind
of pink and rosy,'' he said. ``The other will be big and grayish,
maybe twice the size of the normal one. It's ugly.'' A diseased
heart may weigh a pound and half, twice as much as a normal heart.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 43,837 Americans died of heart failure, and it is
listed as a contributing factor in about 250,000 deaths a year.
``It takes years off people's lives,'' Domanski said. Healthy
Americans aged 67 to 74 can expect to live another 10 to 18 years,
but if they develop heart failure severe enough to require a
hospital stay, their life expectancy is reduced to two to four
years. It also causes great suffering, leaving its victims in what
Domanski calls a ``breathless existence.''
</P>
<P>
   In its worst form, stage four heart failure, the disease leaves
a person housebound, short of breath even at rest. Lying down makes
it harder still to breathe, as fluid pools in the lungs, and many
people find that the only way they can sleep is propped up on
pillows or sitting in a chair. As fluid builds up in the lungs,
some liken the sensation to drowning, and they may be rushed to the
emergency room, gasping for breath and coughing up blood and mucus
_``bubbling at the gills,'' as one doctor put it.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
say that survival after a diagnosis of heart failure is ``bleak and
may be worse than the prognosis for most types of cancer.'' Five
years after diagnosis, half of all patients are dead; 20 percent
die within in a year. Compared to the general population, those who
survive are six to nine times more likely to die suddenly from
disturbances in heart rhythm brought on by heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the increase in congestive heart failure has
inspired researchers to look for new ways to treat it _ developing
drugs, surgical procedures and mechanical pumps to assist heart
function _ or, better, to prevent or at least delay its
progression. Many medical centers have created clinics that
specialize in heart failure. The hope is that with better
treatment, patients who already have the disease will survive
longer and with a better quality of life, even if the condition
kills them in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are detecting the disease much earlier,'' said Fuster, who
also directs the cardiovascular institute at Mount Sinai Hospital.
``With echocardiograms we can now detect a person who has a mild
decrease in heart function, and we can begin to treat this person,
and I think we are preventing this person from appearing in later
years with significant trouble. Fifteen years ago we did not have
the technology to detect it earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Certain drugs, Fuster said, most notably beta blockers and ACE
inhibitors, have helped many patients control symptoms, and may
increase survival by slowing the progression of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lynn Smaha, a cardiologist at the Guthrie Clinic in Sayre,
Pa., said, ``ACE inhibitors have been a godsend to many patients.''
The drugs lighten the load on the heart by relaxing blood vessels
and reducing the body's tendency to retain salt and water. ACE
inhibitors also seem to prevent heart enlargement.
</P>
<P>
   Beta blockers were not recommended for people with heart failure
in the past, but recent studies have suggested that they also may
help, by stabilizing heart rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors should be making better use of both types of drugs,
Fuster said. Also, many cardiologists say these drugs should be
used more often against conditions that can lead to heart failure,
like high blood pressure. In general, many experts believe
hypertension is undertreated in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an epidemic evolving,'' Fuster said, ``but at the
same time the outlook is beginning to look better.''
</P>
<P>
   When drugs no longer work, doctors sometimes turn to surgery in
hope of restoring heart function. Replacing damaged valves can
help, and so can repairing aneurysms, thin and bulging spots, like
bubbles on a tire, that sometimes form on the walls of the heart as
a result of scarring from a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   But one procedure has largely been abandoned, because it helped
too few patients: an operation in which a muscle from the patient's
back was wrapped around the heart and then stimulated to contract
by a pacemaker-like implant.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, another operation, developed in Brazil by Dr.
Randas Batista, attracted attention in the United States, and some
surgeons here began trying it after Batista reported excellent
results in several hundred patients. The procedure involves slicing
out part of the left ventricle, including some healthy muscle, to
return a failing heart to a more normal shape and size.
</P>
<P>
   But American surgeons have lost some of their initial enthusiasm
for the operation. Dr. Patrick McCarthy, surgical director of the
Kaufman Center for heart failure at the Cleveland Clinic, went to
Brazil to learn the procedure from Batista. Now, he said: ``We've
done 62, on patients who were very sick and whose only alternative
was transplant. At six months, 38 percent had to be put back on the
transplant list. At two years, 40 percent were OK, but 60 percent
had returned to heart failure and were back on the transplant
list.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some patients were clearly helped by the operation,
McCarthy said, doctors could not predict who they would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could have two patients with everything the same, and one
would do fine and the other would have to go right to transplant,''
McCarthy said. He now rarely performs the Batista operation, but it
has inspired him to look for better alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   One is a less extreme operation that nonetheless rebuilds the
heart. In one procedure in January, for instance, McCarthy repaired
a leaky valve, did bypasses of the coronary arteries and reshaped
the heart by removing scar tissue left by a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The patient, Mary Constance Sekerak, who is 72, had developed
congestive heart failure shortly after suffering a severe heart
attack in 1997. She deteriorated rapidly and in 1998 was accepted
as a transplant candidate. By that time, she needed oxygen and had
begun using a wheelchair. Rather than continuing to go downhill
while waiting for a transplant, she chose the remodeling procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can walk for 20 or 30 minutes now,'' she said last week. She
works out for an hour three times a week at a cardiac
rehabilitation center. ``Seventy-two might sound pretty old,'' she
said, ``but when you have grandchildren, these are people you want
to keep up with.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For people who are fading too fast to wait for a transplant,
doctors sometimes implant electrically powered pumps in the chest
that act as a bridge to transplant until a donor organ comes along.
Two such pumps, called left-ventricular assist devices, were
approved by the Food and Drug Administration last fall. The devices
cost about $70,000.
</P>
<P>
   The pumps are placed in the abdomen below the heart, and blood
is piped into them from a tube bored into the ventricle, and pumped
back out through another tube that feeds into the aorta. The
devices are powered either by a console plugged into an outlet or a
battery pack, so a cable has to pass through the patient's skin.
</P>
<P>
   Infections, which can be fatal, are a risk. Pump failures also
occur, said Dr. Eric Rose, chairman of the department of surgery at
Columbia University. Nonetheless, he and his colleagues consider
the pumps a good choice for some patients, and Rose said his team
had implanted about 150 so far. Many patients can go home with them
while awaiting a donor heart, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He and researchers at other medical centers are conducting a
study to find out whether the pumps can be used long term, as
``destination therapy,'' instead of just as bridges. So far, 38
patients have signed up, but 100 more are needed.
</P>
<P>
   Without the device, Rose said, ``these patients have a two-year
survival of 25 percent or less.'' He added: ``We're hypothesizing
that this will approximately double their survival time, that half
will live two years. That would be a dramatic improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Fauzi Kanhan, a 55-year-old man who is awaiting a transplant at
Columbia, had an assist pump implanted on April 2 after his
breathlessness became unbearable. Kanhan has extensive damage to
all the chambers of his heart and is not well enough to leave the
hospital for his home in Palisades Park, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a fantastic device,'' Kanhan said, gesturing to
the tube that emerged from his side. The device hissed and clicked
softly, and the console by his side showed his pulse rate, which
ranged from 60 to 80 as he talked and shifted about. If someone
else with severe heart failure asked whether he would recommend the
pump, he said, ``I would say go for it. Nobody likes a foreign
body, but it's saving my life.''
</P>
<P>
   When would he like to have his transplant, and get rid of the
machine?
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' Kanhan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we start to be a bit blue-sky and look down the pike, we
would like to do xenotransplants,'' Domanski said, referring to
heart transplants from animals, which are most likely to be pigs
that have been genetically engineered for that purpose. ``But
that's probably not right around the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other researchers also said that as scientists learn more
about the cellular and molecular changes that occur as heart
failure progresses, they may be able to devise better drug
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond drug treatments, Fuster and other experts look to
research involving ways to use a patient's own tissue to regenerate
healthy heart muscle. Fuster said an exciting development occurred
in March, when Japanese researchers reported that they had taken
bone marrow cells from mice and stimulated them to develop into
muscle cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was absolutely innovative,'' he said, ``a breakthrough.''
If the same could be accomplished with human cells, he said, ``if
we saw a patient with a scarred heart, and could transform marrow
cells into myocardial cells as they were in fetal life, we could
make a scarred heart normal. This is coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Implantable pumps that do not need wires passing through the
skin are also expected, Domanski said, and would greatly reduce the
risk of infection and make it more feasible to consider them a
long-term remedy. In addition to developing pumps that assist only
the left ventricle, researchers are also working on devices that
would replace the entire heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come a long way,'' Domanski said, ``and there's still a
long way to go.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one had ever said that starting her own allergy practice
would be easy, but Dr. Cheryl Lynn Walker was not prepared for the
anxieties that beset her after she opened her doors to patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would get up in the morning, and I would just feel
overwhelmed,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the practice of medicine, she found, was not
the medicine but the practice. Like many physicians, Dr. Walker,
who opened her practice in Chicago in 1990, felt under siege in the
changing landscape of health care, where managed care and corporate
medicine now rule, and doctors often need to be as conversant in
the language of business as they are in healing.
</P>
<P>
   So Dr. Walker did what a growing number of doctors are doing:
she went back to school _ for a master's in business degree.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say more and more doctors are doing just that, as
universities add or adapt programs to meet doctors' needs. The
University of Tennessee, for one, started a program last year; the
Boston University School of Management is starting another one in
the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, medical schools have created programs for students
who want to study for a business degree simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of doctor who seeks an MBA, moreover, appears to be
changing. While the degree is still a pedigree for doctors who
aspire to run a hospital or a health maintenance organization,
where they may never lay hands on a patient, it is now increasingly
attracting doctors who intend to keep practicing.
</P>
<P>
   Some solo practitioners, part of a dwindling breed, also hope a
business degree will give them the financial acumen to allow them
to survive by teaching them how to run their practices more
efficiently. But the investment is considerable, with tuition alone
in the tens of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John A. Fromson, vice president of professional development
for the Massachusetts Medical Society, said last week that when his
organization polled its 17,000 members about whether to begin a
business degree program, 10 percent expressed strong interest. The
medical society, after fielding inquiries from dozens of business
schools, decided to enter into a partnership with Boston
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message was clear that physicians did, indeed, want some
sort of business management training,'' Fromson said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors cite numerous reasons for the change. Where once those
in small or medium-size practices spent most of their time with
patients while clerical staff members handled billing and filed
insurance claims, doctors now find themselves having to make
business decisions on which the survival of their practices could
hinge.
</P>
<P>
   They must decide, for example, which contracts to accept from
managed-care companies. To determine whether the fees offered in a
contract will cover their costs, doctors often must do the kind of
analyses of their own practices that have more traditionally been
used in business settings.
</P>
<P>
   Business schools teach doctors not only the basic principles
that allow them to make these calculations, but also about the
overall economics of health care and how to work in teams.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew McLean Thomas, an internist from Columbus, Ohio, who
graduated from medical school in 1995, decided two years later to
get an MBA. He is now enrolled at the Fisher College of Business at
Ohio State University.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said patients could be better served if administrators
making broad policy decisions in large health care organizations
had not just business degrees but medical ones.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who hopes to treat patients and to work as an
administrator, said it was essential in the current changing
medical climate for doctors in management positions to have
training in business to make decisions that resulted in the best
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to making business decisions, the days of `I am
doctor, therefore I am right, and cost be damned' are out the
window,'' Thomas said. ``Everyone has to understand we're living in
an era of constrained resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, not every doctor is enamored of the trend toward combined
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Laster, chancellor emeritus of the University of
Massachusetts Medical Center, expressed concern about the growing
number of doctors who go back to school for business training,
questioning whether practicing doctors should adopt the philosophy
of business executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation that a single individual can espouse and live
by the two incompatible creeds appears unrealistic,'' Laster wrote
in a 1998 issue of American Medical News, published by the American
Medical Association, ``and I will not allow my family members to be
guinea pigs for testing whether these professional polarities can
be successfully used. I say let businessmen be businessmen and
pursue profits, and let doctors be doctors and care for patients.''

 UNDATED: for patients.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Dr. Walker, 40, going to business school did present a kind
of culture shock. She was the only doctor in the executive MBA
program at the University of Chicago, and she quickly had to learn
a new way of thinking.
</P>
<P>
   But within a year of graduating from the part-time program, she
said, she had recouped the cost of the degree, about $25,000,
largely through improved billing and administrative practices.
</P>
<P>
   Walker says the business training has not affected how she
handles her patients.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she said, by teaching her to be more efficient, the
training allows her to use her time the way she wants: spending
more time with patients and working two days a week in research.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while she is glad she went back to school, Dr. Walker
sounds anything but sanguine about the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my small practice,'' she said. ``And so I've decided
that I'm just going to give it the best that I can, until I can't
do it any longer. And then at that point I will need to join up
with a larger group.''

   Benefits and Risks Of Sun Exposure
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Is exposure to sunlight the best way to get the
amount of Vitamin D that our bodies need?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Alisha Berger
</P>
<P>
   Though there is no question that chronic, excessive exposure to
sunlight is harmful to the skin, we should not ignore the important
beneficial effect of sunlight exposure _ the production of vitamin
D.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies have reported that between 41 percent and 54
percent of adults over age 50 are deficient in vitamin D. This
silent epidemic causes the painful bone disease osteomalacia, as
well as exacerbating bone loss, osteoporosis and the risk of
fractures.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the hypothesis that the higher incidence of colon, breast,
prostate and ovarian cancer in people living at higher latitudes
could be due to lack of vitamin D production in the skin has
recently gained new scientific backing.
</P>
<P>
   Increased production of vitamin D in the skin, by the action of
sunlight, may play an important role in the regulation of cell
growth and help prevent the development of some cancers.
</P>
<P>
   It has been estimated that 90 percent of our vitamin D
requirement comes from casual exposure to sunlight. It is difficult
to get the recommended amount of vitamin D from the diet alone. It
is naturally rare in food and is found only in cod liver oil and
fatty fish such as salmon, and some foods are fortified with it.
</P>
<P>
   _ DR. MICHAEL F. HOLICK
</P>
<P>
   Professor of medicine, dermatology and physiology, Boston
University Medical Center
</P>
<P>
   Vitamin D is an essential nutrient with a critical role in
maintaining healthy bones and absorbing calcium from the diet.
There has been speculation that vitamin D supplementation beyond
regular requirements may be able to reduce the risk of certain
types of cancers such as colon or breast, but the data to support
this in humans has been circumstantial.
</P>
<P>
   And high doses of vitamin D derivatives as chemotherapy in
preexisting tumors have so far been disappointing. This does not
rule out a potential role for the vitamin in reducing the risk of
tumors that are not yet present.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the outcome of definitive studies, attempting to
boost vitamin D levels above normal by intentional sun exposure is
not the best approach. If you were asked to enroll in a trial of a
new injectable drug that was thought to help reduce cancer risk,
you might say yes. What would you say though, if you were told that
the vehicle in which the drug is given is a known carcinogen that
also suppresses the immune system and accelerates aging?
</P>
<P>
   If vitamin D is proven effective for reducing the risk of
internal cancers, nutritional supplements will likely be the
preferred method to deliver the dose. &QL;

   PREVENTION For Hikers, the Perils of High and Dry
</P>
<P>
   Most mountain hikers are ending up high and dry, according to a
University of Colorado study conducted in Rocky Mountain National
Park.
</P>
<P>
   At altitudes above 8,000 feet, people need to consume double the
water they would at sea level, yet the survey of 126 hikers on a
popular 14.5-mile trail elevated over 10,000 feet found that only 1
percent carried a sufficient water load, a half liter per hour of
walking, said Dr. Jack Westfall, the lead author of the study. A
third of the 126 hikers surveyed carried only one liter for the
entire 16-hour trip, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``At high altitudes your body works harder to survive. You
breathe twice as fast,'' said Westfall, who teaches family medicine
at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver.
Most water loss is due to respiration, rather than perspiration. If
dehydration results, you experience ``fatigue and profound
thirst,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that only 30 percent of hikers used
sunblock. ``Solar radiation is much greater at high altitudes,''
Westfall said. ``You can get severe burns above the tree line
because there is nothing absorbing light and the sun reflects off
the snow.'' He recommends lotion with an SPF factor of at least 20.
</P>
<P>
   Hikers can minimize the deleterious effects of high altitudes by
spending two days acclimatizing themselves at spots around 8,000
feet. During these periods, Westfall said, ``Don't do anything
strenuous. Just hang out, maybe take a one-hour hike.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last 10 years, the number of Americans hiking and
backpacking has doubled, and now includes 40.1 million
participants, said Mike May of the Sporting Goods Manufacturers
Association, a trade group. &QL;

   SAFETY Staying Vigilant for Choking Hazards
</P>
<P>
   Meals served to young children outside the home may present a
greater choking risk than those served at home, according to a
report presented last week at a meeting of the American Society of
Pediatric Otolaryngology. Dr. James S. Reilly, chairman of the
department of surgery at Dupont Hospital for Children in
Wilmington, Del., noted that care givers may not always be aware of
the most appropriate foods for a given age group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain foods put children at risk, and it begs us to avoid
providing food that younger children can't handle,'' said Reilly,
the lead author of the report.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, researchers reviewed 5,588 cases over a seven-year
period in which children under 20 were hospitalized for choking on
small objects or food. Seventy-eight percent of injuries involved
children under 4. Children with developmental delay or who had
cerebral palsy were five times as likely to suffer injury from
foods that were given to them.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the foods most likely to result in injury were
nuts (544), chunks of meat (125), chicken parts (121), seeds (116),
carrots (83), hot dogs and sausage (70), fish bone (52), apples
(47) and hard candy (34). None of the cases were fatal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most children under 3 don't have all of their teeth, and so
there may be an element of risk when they ingest hard, small,
smoothly textured foods like hot dogs,'' Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   He recommended that children be supervised while they eat and
that nuts, hot dogs, carrots, and apples be consumed with care.

<P>
   If civilized disagreement is the hallmark of sophisticated
individuals, the Modern Library's just-released list of its panel's
choices for the 100 best nonfiction books will give lots of
self-styled literati the chance to prove just how sophisticated
they are.
</P>
<P>
   The list _ limited to books written in English and published in
the 20th century _ is absolutely unofficial. The Modern Library, a
division of giant publisher Random House, decided last year to draw
attention to its line of ``classic'' reprinted titles by putting
together a panel of writers who selected an arbitrary Best 100
works of 20th-century fiction. The results _ headed by James
Joyce's ``Ulysses'' and F. Scott Fitzgerald's ``The Great Gatsby''
_ proved only that a group of older white males preferred books
written by older (or long dead) white males.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Modern Library's brain trust is back with the nonfiction
100. It has added two women and an African-American to the panel,
offering token appeasement to those whom it aggravated the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   The result still invites furious criticism. ``The Education of
Henry Adams'' is a reasonable No. 1, but it's doubtful too many
people other than panel members have even heard of, let alone read,
``The Varieties of Religious Experience'' by William James, at No.
2. (It's enlightening to note that the James book is a Modern
Library title.) Booker T. Washington's ``Up From Slavery'' is a
worthy third, though skeptics might assume it was placed that high
not in tribute but as token. (On the fiction list, Ralph Ellison's
seminal ``Invisible Man'' was only 19th.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X'' limps in at 51. Room is found
at 93 for Richard Hofstadter's ``The American Political
Tradition,'' but nowhere to be seen are Theodore White's ``The
Making of the President 1960,'' which served as a blueprint for the
modern political primary system; ``The Best and the Brightest,''
David Halberstam's epic dismantling of the U.S. government's
ill-advised foray into Vietnam; or ``All the President's Men,'' the
Bob Woodward-Carl Bernstein recounting of the fall of Richard Nixon
and The Washington Post reporters' role in it.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Mailer will undoubtedly fume. ``In Cold Blood,'' Truman
Capote's masterful fiction/fact recounting of brutal murder, is
acknowledged at No. 96, but Mailer's two similar masterworks, ``The
Armies of the Night'' and ``The Executioner's Song,'' are both
ignored. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Cleverly, Modern Library has made it possible for readers to
electronically ``vote'' for their own Best 100 lists on the Random
House Web site at www.randomhouse.com. Outside voters have had
months to respond to the fiction hundred, and that response is just
as quirky as the original voting by the Modern Library panel. Ayn
Rand's ``Atlas Shrugged'' and ``The Fountainhead'' are first and
second, followed by L. Ron Hubbard's ``Battlefield Earth'' and
J.R.R. Tolkien's ``The Lord of the Ring'' trilogy. None of these
titles made the panel's list.
</P>
<P>
   In the few days since the 100 nonfiction honorees were
announced, Web site voting has produced an almost laughable
response: As of Friday morning, New Age guru Peter McWilliams was
No. 1 with ``Ain't Nobody's Business If You Do,'' and Ayn Rand's
``The Virtue of Selfishness,'' co-authored with Nathaniel Branden,
was No. 2. It must be assumed that lots of Ayn Rand fans use the
Internet. ``The Education of Henry Adams'' does not appear on the
reader nonfiction 100, though ``Ulysses'' is at No. 11 in its
fiction poll.
</P>
<P>
   So what's to be made of all this? Well, somebody at the Modern
Library is due another raise. The nonfiction list, with all its
warts, obvious favoritism to Modern Library titles and glaring
omissions, is being talked about _ just like the fiction list.
</P>
<P>
   Anything that starts people talking about books is good for
everyone. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of people who haven't read
``The Education of Henry Adams'' since it was forced on them as a
college assignment may reread this wonderful tale of society
force-fed into modern times. Those who forgot the thrill of Robert
Massie's ``Nicholas and Alexandra'' will furiously return to it,
just to confirm their certainty it should have made the Modern
Library's list. Book critics everywhere will analyze it all,
tossing in their opinions as though the Modern Library list might
have had some legitimacy had they been added to the panel.
</P>
<P>
   And the Modern Library brain trust will wallow in the publicity.
Just like last time with the fiction list, it's the big winner
here.

TEXAS SENATOR GRAMM PRESSES FOR BANKING OVERHAUL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARIA RECIO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Phil Gramm has wasted no time taking the reins
of the Senate Banking Committee and establishing who's boss.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Republican, who became chairman in January, has
brought the tricks he learned on the presidential campaign trail _
from organizing pep rallies to making sound bites _ to the task of
moving landmark legislation that would restructure the nation's
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   This week, he faces his first major test as chairman when the
Senate takes up the controversial and far-reaching bill. On Monday,
the Senate began consideration of legislation that would break down
the walls that separate banking, securities and insurance
companies, spurring creation of financial supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not often you get to handle the most important banking
bill in 60 years,'' Gramm said in an interview. ``I want to pass a
good bill.''
</P>
<P>
   And for Gramm, a ``good'' bill is one to his liking and one
that, for the moment, he has not been able to reach a compromise on
with the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's committee approved the bill on March 4 by a vote of 11-9
along party lines. The administration is so opposed to the
legislation that President Clinton personally wrote Gramm in early
March threatening a veto _ an unusually personal and early warning
in the legislative process.
</P>
<P>
   In a long-awaited meeting on Thursday with Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of
South Dakota and Sen. Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, the ranking
Democrat on the banking panel, Gramm again failed to reach a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good discussion. We did not reach an agreement on the
issues in dispute,'' Gramm said. ``My job as chairman is to try to
pass this bill. It's a bill that's important to all three
industries that are directly affected and even more important to
their customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarbanes and other Democrats unhappy with some of Gramm's
provisions have indicated that they may filibuster the bill. Gramm
acknowledged the possibility by saying, ``I hope we don't encounter
gridlock on this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists say the bill has two provisions that could kill it:
</P>
<P>
   _Limits on the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). For more than
20 years, the law has required banks to make loans in their
communities. Gramm wants to put curbs on a law he says has become
burdensome.
</P>
<P>
   _Responsibility for regulatory oversight. The Treasury
Department and the Federal Reserve Board are in a turf fight over
which agency would control the newly structured financial entities.
Gramm favors the Federal Reserve Board and Clinton favors the
Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Although both issues are considered ``veto bait,'' the CRA is by
far the more controversial provision. Busloads of minority
protesters, in fact, demonstrated outside Gramm's Washington home
on a recent Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, who was not home at the time, called the protest ``an
effort to intimidate'' and said, ``This is part of this job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Community Reinvestment Act was designed to spur lending for
home purchases and small business investment in minority
communities. But Gramm and other critics contend that the CRA has
grown into an onerous burden on many banks. Supporters insist that
it has been crucial to urban revitalization and call the CRA a
civil rights issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the White House and Senate Democrats, CRA is the Holy
Grail,'' said John Heasley, general counsel of the Texas Bankers
Association. ``It is the closest thing to social and economic
justice in a banking regulatory world.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the senator's perspective,'' Heasley said, ``it is
government getting involved in the private sector to determine how
loans are made.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's provision to exempt rural banks from CRA provisions
would affect as many as 200 of Texas' 840 state and national banks,
Heasley said.
</P>
<P>
   The senator has enraged community groups by describing as
``extortion'' bank payments to groups that question a financial
institution's commitment to local lending.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates counter that banks have worked with many of the groups
as partners in developing good lending prospects and making the
process easier in minority neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Extortion is simply not a part of the partnerships,'' said
John Taylor, president of the National Community Reinvestment
Coalition. ``CRA has been instrumental in curbing the practice of
red-lining and dramatically increasing access to capital and credit
for traditionally underserved neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader has also weighed in, telling
community activists last month, ``These blunderbuss attacks on CRA
are amazing even for a Phil Gramm, who has made a career out of
carrying dirty water for banks and big corporations. The CRA is one
of the great success stories of our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the Community Reinvestment Act are marshaling
their forces for this week's fight. Civil rights groups plan a
rally on Tuesday and the U.S. Conference of Mayors has sent a
letter to all senators, signed by more than 150 mayors who support
the CRA and oppose Gramm's proposed changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``As mayors, we recognize that CRA has been an essential tool in
revitalizing cities around this nation,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the mayors who signed the letter are Kenneth Barr of Fort
Worth, Jack Miller of Denton, Mary Lib Saleh of Euless, Charles
Scoma of North Richland Hills and ]Ron Kirk of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The banking industry, which for more than 10 years has been
trying to change the Depression-era rules that govern it, is taking
a low profile on the Community Reinvestment Act. After Gramm
organized three ``pep rallies'' of industry lobbyists to support
the bill, bankers made some muted complaints about the CRA, but
insiders say they have learned to live with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge, huge paperwork problem,'' said Ed Yingling,
executive director of government relations for the American Bankers
Association. ``No matter what your grade is, you're still subject
to challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Yingling gives Gramm high marks for aggressiveness and energy in
assuming the chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really is hands-on,'' said the banking industry lobbyist,
referring to the pep rallies Gramm organized. ``We're not used to
having a senator, let alone the chairman, directly involved in
strategy and telling us the things that need to be done.''
</P>
<P>

   STEPHENVILLE, Texas _ On a cool, misty but sunny morning, Ty
Murray began his day at 7:30, punching cattle on his 1,851-acre
ranch. Within two hours, Murray, a seven-time winner of rodeo's
world all-around title, has doctored a sick mother cow and has
moved a bawling herd of cattle from one pasture to another. He
relishes the rural life near Stephenville, where he and two-time
world bull riding champion Jim Sharp moved nine years ago. What
Murray and Sharp started has become a stampede of rodeo competitors
heading to this town of 14,400. By BRETT HOFFMAN. Story has moved

 &HT;    Surprise win has Lukas tracking Derby record
 &HT;    By John Crittenden
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ On the day before the Kentucky Derby, Wayne
Lukas was looking over his shoulder at Bob Baffert, who was yapping
at his heels. Lukas had trained three Derby winners, Baffert two.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after the Kentucky Derby, Lukas had turned the page
on Baffert in the history books, ahead 4-2. Now Lukas was looking
at Ben Jones, the only trainer with more Derby winners. At age 63,
Lukas is two victories behind Jones with, on the Lukas timetable,
plenty of time to catch up with the trainer who dominated the Derby
in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   With a grand wave, Lukas pointed to the green signboard with
white lettering posted by Churchill Downs near the stable door at
his barn Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   On the sign were the names Winning Colors, Thunder Gulch and
Grindstone, with the name of Charismatic, winner of the 125
Kentucky Derby, soon to be added. ``You will notice,'' Lukas said,
``there is plenty of room at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason I can't go on winning this race. I'm
enjoying what I do. I'm healthy. There is plenty of time to train
any number of horses as long as you don't play golf or go to the
movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the main thing is that I've got the client base to keep
coming up with winners. I'm going to get Derby horses every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of Lukas' primary backers, Bill Young of Overbrook Farm,
owner of Cat Thief, third Saturday, and Bob and Beverly Lewis,
owners of Charismatic, were at the trainer's side during the race.
His other top owner, Satish Sanan, stood in the barn door behind
Lukas on Sunday, sharing the winner's glow.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody wishes Lukas well. He has won so much.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Maker, the top Lukas assistant in Kentucky , was leading
Charismatic back to the stable after the race when a voice cried
out, ``He'll never win again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike had the right answer,'' Lukas said. ``He doesn't have to
win again.''
</P>
<P>
   With 14 races before the Derby, Charismatic had more losses (11)
than any horse in the field. Already, there are suggestions that
Menifee or the Baffert entries may be favored over the Kentucky
Derby champion May 15 at the Preakness. Lukas shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there was going to be criticism when I ran this horse
on 13 days rest in April,'' he said. ``He needed the work. Maybe
some horses need 15 outs (races) to run their best.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go to the store and get a book that tells you how to
win the Derby. You can't find a computer chip that tells you how to
win. That's why this race is so great. There is no formula.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to believe Lukas did not know the answer, but he
asked about the exact amount of the winner's purse. The answer:
$886,200. ``A nice thing is that 10 percent of that goes to ol'
Wayne,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Whittingham, who died last month, is the only other
trainer with $100 million in earnings. With his Derby payday, Lukas
will surpass $200 million soon, perhaps before May is over.
</P>
<P>
   Like the trainer, the winning jockey, Chris Antley, took 10
percent of the Charismatic winnings.
</P>
<P>
   Antley was not the first choice for the Derby ride.
</P>
<P>
   Lafitt Pincay had the last California assignment on the Derby
winner April 3. Pincay did not want the Kentucky job.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Bailey won with Charismatic at Keeneland on April 18. But
Bailey was committed to ride Worldly Manner Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas talked about what a good match Antley and Charismatic
were. In truth, when the decision was made two weeks ago to go to
the Derby with the Lexington Stakes winner, not many top jockeys
were left uncommitted.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas saw Antley hold up an index figure Saturday just before
Charismatic came to the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antley is lucky that he won,'' Lukas said. ``If he had gotten
beat, I'd have that finger in my office in a jar, making a pickle
out of it.''

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: We are planning a long car trip this summer and I will need
to occupy myself by reading. But I am one of those people who gets
sick from reading or looking at pictures in a car. I have heard of
some device you put on your wrist and it prevents you from becoming
sick or nauseous. Do you know where I could get one of these?
</P>
<P>
   _A. Hamilton
</P>
<P>
   A: You are looking for Sea-Bands, sold in area pharmacies. You
might try this nondrug approach to curing motion sickness. No
guarantee it will work. Sea-Bands won't hurt you and they sell for
less than $10. Motion sickness is the conflict between your body
sensing the motion of the moving car and your eye working to
concentrate on the words on the page. A common cure for motion
sickness is to keep your eyes fixed on the horizon _ where the car
is going. Let me know if Sea-Bands work for you!
</P>
<P>
   Q: I received a Christmas gift of M&AMP;M cookies in a jar for all
my volunteer hours at my child's school. I have tried several
recipes and have not found the same texture cookie. My family wants
the recipe for M&AMP;M cookies in a jar. Can you help? _E. Emmons
</P>
<P>
   A: Glad your school efforts were recognized. Bravo! This is a
Jackie Gannaway recipe. Call Gannaway at 477-7070. ($3.95 plus tax,
add shipping if ordering from Gannaway.) Enjoy 23 cookie mixes and
three brownie mixes in this booklet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The term ``tank'' for a pond seems uniquely Texan. How did
the usage get started? _D.P.
</P>
<P>
   A: A tank is an artificial reservoir, pool or cistern. Texas has
only one major natural freshwater lake, Caddo Lake, according to
the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, so building
tanks and damming rivers is essential for an adequate water supply.
Texana expert Mike Cox says water-poor West Texas has many tanks,
and both tanks and ponds are commonly referred to as tanks. In East
Texas, where ponds probably outnumber tanks, ``pond'' is the term
used for both.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do birds really sing more in the spring, or do they just seem
to? _Susan M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yep, they sure do. Travis Audubon Society's John Kelly says
most of the singing is by males looking for mates (hear a few bars
of ``I'm in the Mood For Love''?) and warning other birds to stay
clear of their territory (all together now, ``This land is my land
...''). Spring is, after all, nesting season. The most versatile
avian chanter? The East Coast's brown thrasher. This relative of
the mockingbird sings more than 2,000 different phrases.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I enjoyed reading how round toothpicks are made. Now please
tell me how string cheese is made. _S.K.
</P>
<P>
   A: String cheese is mozzarella cheese in an interesting shape.
According to Greg Desautels, quality assurance manager for Saputo
Cheese USA, mozzarella has an inherent stringing property.
Technically, the cheese's milk proteins line up in straight lines
after the cheese is kneaded and heated. To make it string cheese,
taffy-like mozzarella cheese is pumped into an extrusion head
(think of a giant sieve). The cheese (about a half-inch thick)
comes out in long ropes. After being chopped into 4 1/2-inch
lengths, the string cheese is dropped in brine, cooled and
packaged.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I purchased a NewCom modem at Circuit City in April 1998. I
mailed in the $30 rebate offer but have yet to receive it. The Los
Angeles Better Business Bureau said they've stopped taking
complaints about NewCom because of poor response. How I can get my
rebate check? _Kyle Stubbings
</P>
<P>
   A: I think you can kiss the rebate goodbye. After several chats
with NewCom (not an easy place to contact), I received a letter
from NewCom's attorney (J.C. Fedalen, Sabo &AMP; Green, 23801 Calabasas
Road, Suite 1015, Calabasas, Calif. 91302) stating, ``NewCom is ...
resolving the rebate issue by way of a stipulation and settlement
in a lawsuit ... rebates will be paid under the auspices of the
Court.'' The Los Angeles BBB is accepting complaints about NewCom
(the tally: 36 complaints, 16 satisfied, 1 unresolved, 19 ignored
or pending). Send your complaint to the LABBB, P.O. Box 970,
Colton, Calif. 92324. Q: I have a moderately sized collection of
brass and would like to clean it and store it. I had thought I
could wrap it in paper towels and then seal it in storage bags. Do
you have any suggestions as to how to store it and not have it
tarnish? _Gloria Eckstrom
</P>
<P>
   A: Darren Wicker of Austin Brass recommends wrapping the brass
items in cloth (old sheets?) before placing them in plastic.
Tarnish is retarded by limited exposure to air. The plastic will
help do that. However, Wicker warns not to let the plastic touch
the brass, especially if the brass is lacquered. Lacquered brass
should never be stored in hot areas such as attics or garages.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A short time ago there was an obituary that included a very
moving snippet from a poem: ``... and when he shall die, take him
and cut him out in little stars, and he will make the face of
heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night ...''
A few years ago I lost my own beautiful adult son. After that
dreadful event I began writing poetry of my own. Can you find out
the poet and title and where I can find the poem? _O.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``And pay no worship to the garish sun.'' Act III, Scene 2
from William Shakespeare's ``Romeo and Juliet.'' This popular
passage is spoken by Juliet opining in the Capulet orchard.
</P>
<P>
   Contact Jane Greig, author of ``Thanks for Asking,'' at P.O. Box
670, Austin, TX, 78767; (512) 445-3697; e-mail

   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S `LATE NIGHT WITH CONAN O'BRIEN' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo.com has started posting a security message on its web site
that warns Internet users to `never assume people online are who
they say they are.' For instance, Yahoo says that most people
online claiming to be 18-year-old girls are actually President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The new high-tech, Star Wars toys are coming out soon. The toys
can talk and are interactive so they can be easily distinguished
from Star Wars fans.
</P>
<P>
   First, reports came out that Pamela Anderson Lee had her breast
implants removed, then yesterday it was reported that she had the
implants replaced with smaller ones. Now today Pamela claims both
reports are false, and that she just had her implants rotated.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the FDA approved a new obesity drug that blocks fat.
In fact, this morning, it wouldn't let Star Jones into work.
</P>
<P>
   Last night in an interview with Connie Chung, Calista Flockhart
said that she's lost four pounds working out, and that she's now in
the best shape of her life. Flockhart said, `I can run the 100 yard
dash in under ten seconds if there is a good wind.'
</P>
<P>
   The Rolling Stones announced that they have changed their minds,
and they will not do a concert at Madison Square Garden this New
Year's Eve. Apparently, the Stones are worried that their pace
makers are not Y2K compatible.
</P>
<P>
   The other day in Florida a 78-year-old man was arrested after he
robbed a bank and led police on a car chase. Actually, it wasn't
really a car chase, it was more like a long slow left turn.
</P>
<P>
   Ripley's Museum wants to get Pamela Anderson Lee's old breast
implants, and put them on display, but it turns out Pamela has
other plans for the implants. She is using them to make a
catamaran.
</P>
<P>
   A brand new book is coming out. It claims that Al Gore smoked a
lot of pot in college. Apparently, you could always tell when Gore
was really high, because he would stare straight ahead, and speak
in monotone.
</P>
<P>
   It was reported today that Michael Jackson's kids also wear
masks when they go out in public. Not because of germs, but because
their father is Michael Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The `Today' show canceled a scheduled interview with Calista
Flockhart because she said she didn't want to talk about her
weight. Flockhart said instead, she wanted to talk about ricecakes.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Lee says that since she had surgery to remove her
implants her breasts feel like they're on fire. This is a
coincidence, because Pamela's old implants are now being used to
cushion people jumping out of burning buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Hillary Clinton was principal for a day at a New York
City middle school. Apparently the kids loved it, because they
could all fool around and she had no idea that anything was going
on.
</P>
<P>
   It was reported today that Martha Stewart has contributed a lot
of money to Al Gore's campaign. Not only that, she has also given
Gore tips on how to bring out his rich mahogany finish.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, a funeral home worker is in big trouble because he left
a body in the back of a hearse while he hung out at a topless bar.
If that weren't bad enough, on his way home he propped the body up
in the front seat, so he could use the carpool lane.
</P>
<P>
   It was reported this week that Pamela Anderson Lee is getting
back together with rocker Tommy Lee. I think this is a real shame,
because most men were hoping Pamela would get back together with
her implants.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S `THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The following are quotes from Jay Leno's monologue for the week
of April 26, 1999
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky said today, if they make a TV movie about the
scandal, she wants Neve Campbell to play her. And for Linda Tripp,
I think she wants Ed Asner. President Clinton said today, if they
get Neve Campbell to play Monica, he'll play himself.
</P>
<P>
   The price of gasoline continues to rise in California. Two bucks
a gallon in many places. $2.27 in Beverly Hills. In fact today an
armored car was held up just for the gas.
</P>
<P>
   To show you how time flies, know what happened seven years ago?
The LA riots. And here's a scary thought. Those extended warranties
on those TV's are starting to run out and the HDTV just came in, so
you might want to think about upgrading. It's VCR Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
   The country of Jamaica has approved the growing of hemp to be
used in cat food. In fact, experts said today if a cat spends his
whole life eating hemp cat food, by the time it's five, it will
have a street value of $22,000.
</P>
<P>
   According to a new study, most couples report that sex is better
while on vacation. I'll bet that's why dad never wanted to stop the
car on our way down to the shore. Remember, dad was always in a
hurry to get there, no bathroom breaks, no food, let's just get to
the shore.
</P>
<P>
   I'm 49. I made a decision today. I don't really have any
political affiliation. I'm kinda in the middle, but I'm thinking
maybe I should become a Republican. See if you're a Democrat and
you're 49, you're over the hill, but if you're 49 and a Republican,
you're the youngest guy out there.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest issue of Nature Biotechnology,
scientists have implanted human DNA into female goats. Is that
really new? I think lonely farmers have been doing that for years.
</P>
<P>
   This is our second night of broadcasting in high-definition
television (April 27). With a high-definition TV everything looks
bigger and wider. It's kind of like going to your 25th high school

   &UR; OPENING REMARKS FROM THE ``LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``According to New York City Police Department statistics,
traffic deaths here in New York City are down 31%. This just goes
to show you what I've been saying all along is true -- cab drivers
are getting lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrity birthdays today -- Saddam Hussein is 62 years old.
Saddam celebrated the same way he does every year -- at a quiet
party at the Baghdad Hooters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good news, Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee are getting back
together. They're being cautious, they're taking it very slow, one
step at a time. Right now, Tommy Lee is dating her implants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations are in order to Woody Allen -- he and Soon-Yi
have a brand-new baby daughter. It's all part of Woody's plan to
grow his own wives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Woody would not say whether or not the baby is adopted, but
right about now, Mia Farrow has launched a headcount to see if
anybody's missing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking of Woody Allen, over the weekend they had a big
auction where they auctioned off props from all of the old Woody
Allen movies. Ladies and gentlemen, you're looking at the proud new
owner of Tony Roberts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie that they're making over there in Italy with Monica
Lewinsky is a comedy with a little sex in it, sort of like the
Clinton administration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica Lewinsky, the most popular, most famous woman in the
world, as you know, is moving to Italy and she's going to star in
an Italian movie over there...Monica likes being in the movies. She
says one day, she hopes to have her own action figure. This is how
dumb I am -- I thought she was an action figure.''
</P>

   It was a rainy spring evening and I looked out my window on
Washington Square at the shiny, deserted streets. Then I realized
that the streets were not entirely deserted: there was a couple in
front of the New York University dormitory, dancing a slow, elegant
jitterbug.
</P>
<P>
   As I watched, I was suddenly on the Champs Elysees, 40 years
ago. I was studying at the Sorbonne under the G.I. Bill, and
friends had assembled a makeshift band. They were playing as my
future wife and I jitterbugged in front of an entranced crowd of
Parisians who tossed coins in a hat. We left the coins for our
friends but I have lived on the nostalgia ever since.

   Down and out in the early '70s, I turned to panhandling on
Second Avenue, a few blocks north of St. Mark's Place. I had heard
the legend that one of my colleagues, with a master's degree in
psychology, was pulling down thousands a month on the street by
sizing up his patrons and using what he thought would be the ideal
pitch for each one. However, I was barely able to get a meal or two
each day. Once, when I approached a man waiting for a bus and
politely asked for spare change, he turned, peered into my eyes,
and pinched my cheek. ``Too much fat,'' he said as he turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, I found work and now, two master's degrees
later, I remember with gratitude the people who helped me then, for
example, a woman who looked like a secretary and dug through her
wallet to give me $1.50 when I was very hungry. Now that I'm living
better, when panhandlers approach, look clean and have no signs of
flagrant addictions, I get a charge out of sometimes handing them a
$20 bill, knowing well what they feel like at that moment.
Sometimes they actually dance, other times they get a faraway look
and tears fill their eyes. I've done it myself and I know how long
they wait for such moments.

   Elie Feuerwerker was on a 96th Street bus crossing Central Park
when the bus driver took up his microphone to announce: ``Would the

dance.''

   Ira Wells probably won't be challenged when he describes his
103-year-old mother as the oldest living graduate (class of 1916)
of Hunter College. Lillian Welkowitz, who lives on Staten Island,
recently asked her son to comparison-shop for an air conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   He reported that New Jersey prices were a bit lower than those
locally, but Mrs. Welkowitz, a former mathematics teacher, decided
to patronize a local shop. ``The slight difference won't make much
difference pro-rated over 10 years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Berg was strolling on Fifth Avenue when a pair of
teen-age girls, wearing blue jeans, T-shirts and baggy jackets,
shopping bags in hand, passed him. He overheard this conversation:
</P>
<P>
   First girl: ``You know, 15 was awful for me _ like I felt
inadequate _ you know, like, I had absolutely no self-esteem _
like, it was awful!''
</P>
<P>
   Second girl: ``Well, you seem O.K. now.''
</P>
<P>
   First girl: ``Yeah. But it's, like, I'm 17 now. Now I know
exactly where I'm going. Like, you know, I feel really great.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Berg's summation: ``Boy, it must be great to be 17 _ like,
you know, I can hardly remember _ like, when I was 17.''
</P>
<P>
   Informative and fascinating messages sometimes appear at subway
token booths. A couple of examples, late last year at the 77th
Street uptown booth, Maxine Levinson noted such daily maxims as
``Lots of people confuse bad management with destiny,'' and ``If
you always do what you've always done, you'll always be what you've
always been.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, at 86th Street and Broadway, the message read,
``Fear is a little dark room where negatives are developed.'' Who
knew a subway station could be the source of enlightenment, asked
Leland J. Brandt, just one of the straphangers who left the station
with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   There were 17 people divided up for a softball game. Nine
children, ages 4 to 14, formed one team and eight adults, ages 35
to 70, formed the other team. During the warm-up session, the
adults knew their goose was cooked when one of them overheard our
grandson, Ted, saying: ``Let's practice grounders. The grown-ups
can't bend.'' P.S. The children won.

   Amy and Kent Hikida were at a performance of the Broadway show
``Art.'' The lights dimmed, the actors entered and most eyes were
focused on the minimal white on white painting on which the play
centers. Focal point or not, the art didn't impress one
theatergoer. A woman shouted from the balcony, ``My son has one
just like that, only it's in red.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pump restaurant, a small establishment on 31st Street near
Lexington Avenue, will be dark on what is one of the busiest
dining-out days of the year. A sign in the window advises: ``Closed
Mother's Day. We will be celebrating our first Mother's Day with
our 4-month-old daughter. Owners Steve and Elena Kapelonis.''

LAWMAKERS SEE WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE IN COLORADO SHOOTINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., S.C., Ala.)  (mk) 
 By SEAN LOUGHLIN   
 New York Times Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If there is a lesson to be learned from the deadly
shootings at a Colorado high school, Democrats and Republicans are
studying two different textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Although the general consensus is that there is no one cause or
explanation for the April 20 rampage at Columbine High School that
left 15 dead, the two political parties disagree about what they're
willing to consider.
</P>
<P>
   While denouncing violence in movies and video games, Democrats
also view the tragedy through the prism of gun control, saying the
shooting underscores the easy availability of guns and points to
the need for stricter regulation of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure the NRA will criticize those of us who connect this
violence with the easy access of guns in America,'' said Sen.
Dianne Feinsten, D-Calif. ``But sadly, times of tragedy like this
are often the only times people pay attention to the problems
plaguing our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fritz Hollings, D-S.C., last week called on the Senate to
consider a colleague's bill on handgun control, decrying the
``inordinate number of pistols and firearms in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans say the shooting is all about a cultural
meltdown in a nation awash in media violence, and in which little
premium placed on either morality or personal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have not been acculturated with the kind of
gentlemanliness and gentlewomanliness, not inculcated with
religious faith and discipline, maybe a lack of values or
whatever,'' said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., in describing the
mentality of some young people today.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats agree that violence on the Internet, on
television and in the movies has gotten out of hand. President
Clinton, in fact, plans to host a national summit on violence in
the media at the White House on May 10. At the same time, Clinton
wants Congress to pass a comprehensive series of new gun-control
laws, including the enactment of a waiting period for the purchase
of handguns, the expanding of background checks for the purchase of
explosives, and the banning of minors from possessing semiautomatic
assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party, however, appears unwilling to cede any
ground on the issue of gun control. Some GOP lawmakers have devoted
entire speeches to the nation's deadliest school shooting without
once mentioning the word ``gun.'' And many Democrats who come from
rural districts in the South and West are reluctant to embrace any
new gun control measures, saying that no new law could have stopped
the violence in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   In short, lawmakers see in the school shootings what they want
to see. The tragedy at Columbine has become Exhibit A on Capitol
Hill, providing the perfect example for whatever it is a lawmaker
or interest group wants to argue.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., tied the shooting to a lack of prayer
and faith in schools. ``Have we created a spiritual void in our
schools, which is now being filled with drugs and sex and
violence?'' DeMint asked. ``It is clear there were very deep
spiritual problems in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader had a different but predictable
take, placing the blame on corporate America, ``the powerful monied
interests that produce this culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader said that the quest for bigger profits has led to a
proliferation of movies, video games and artists that celebrate
violence and nihilism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Focus on the deeper problems,'' Nader urged. ``Behind every
Marilyn Manson are corporations and corporate executives who
cynically draw their compensation packages from the fruits of such
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader's comments touch on another aspect of the debate over the
Colorado tragedy _ the role of money in politics. While Clinton and
many lawmakers have called on Hollywood to take the lead in
limiting the random violence in movies and television, they also
have their hand out for campaign donations. In 1997-98, political
action committees associated with the entertainment industry
contributed $2.8 million to candidates. Republicans, who control
Congress, collected roughly 55 percent of that total, compared to
45 percent for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association, one of the most powerful lobbies
on Capitol Hill, is also generous with its donations. According to
a study by Common Cause, the NRA spent close to $2 million on
political contributions to candidates and national parties in
1997-98. Roughly 85 percent of that total went to Republicans.

LAST WORDS FROM A GIANT OF LINGUISTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 9)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lh) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the Lexicographic Irregulars who regularly instruct,
correct, clarify, amplify and berate the author of this column,
none carried the scholarly authority of James D. McCawley, the
University of Chicago's iconoclastic professor of linguistics, who
died last month.
</P>
<P>
   When Jim straightened you out, you could feel the
wrenching-around for months. As a pop grammarian, I like to abide
by, and pass along, simple rules of style. But as the father of
generative semantics, which instills logic and meaning into the
built-in grammar discovered by Noam Chomsky of MIT, McCawley liked
to challenge those rules by showing the delicious complexity of our
syntax.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I noted the Associated Press rule for when to use
 &UR; between &LR;  and  &UR; among &LR; : `` &UR; Between &LR;  introduces two items and  &UR; among &LR; 
more than two.'' Although I fuzzily warned about the trickiness of
the relationship of several items considered a pair at a time,
McCawley came thundering back with the vivid examples that bring
his theories to life: ``Only  &UR; between &LR;  is appropriate when you say,
`He held four golf balls  &UR; between &LR;  his fingers' or `He has a fungus
infection  &UR; between &LR;  his toes.'''
</P>
<P>
   No arguing with that, even as I try the four-golf-ball stretch;
it is not in the grammar that is hard-wired in our heads to say,
``The golf balls are  &UR; among &LR;  my fingers.'' Jim then zinged home the
lesson: ``What determines the choice of the preposition isn't
whether its object denotes two entities or more than two, but
whether the entities are being referred to in twos or in
combinations of more than two.'' Therefore, I will follow the
simple rule of style ( &UR; between &LR;  two,  &UR; among &LR;  several), remembering
the exception's complexity every time I feel an itch in my shoes.
</P>
<P>
   In the same authoritative way, McCawley took apart the New York
Times style manual's representation of how  &UR; each other &LR;  and  &UR; one
another &LR;  work. (``Two persons look at  &UR; each other &LR; ; more than two
look at  &UR; one another &LR; .'') Try this sentence for size, McCawley
responded:  &UR; They spent the afternoon taking group photographs of &LR; 
each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to follow your style manual's recommendation and
replace  &UR; each other &LR;  with  &UR; one another &LR; ,'' he wrote, ``the result
would have the ridiculous implication that each of the group
photographs depicted only one person. The difference that this
example points to is that  &UR; one another &LR;  generalizes over something
that is semantically singular, whereas  &UR; each other &LR;  does not
specify the semantic number and is thus available for generalizing
over things like `He took a group photograph of  &UR; them &LR; ,' with a
semantically plural element.''
</P>
<P>
   In case I didn't get that, he offered another sentence with
semantic singularity:  &UR; Those children like to gang up on &LR;  each
other. ``Again, replacing  &UR; each other &LR;  with  &UR; one another &LR;  would
make it sound ridiculous,'' McCawley instructed, ``implying that a
single child could gang up on another child.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so our rule doesn't always work. But it usually does, and if
we did away with rules, how could language mavens ever correct
anybody? The Gotcha! Gang would be forced to disband, and one of
life's great intellectual pleasures would disappear.
</P>
<P>
   McCawley, a handlebar-mustachioed libertarian gutsy enough to
take on his testy teacher, Chomsky, sometimes came to my defense.
When I wrote, ``He made a few calls and reported back'' in a
political column, Charles Barnard of Modern Maturity magazine
wrote: ``To  &UR; report back &LR;  is redundant, no? Doesn't the prefix  &UR; re &LR; 
mean `back'?'' I appealed to Jim, who reported back: ``No,  &UR; report
back &LR;  isn't redundant.  &UR; Report &LR;  has severed its connection to its
etymology, and one can report to anyone who's interested in what
one is reporting.  &UR; Report back &LR;  specifies a report to the person
who issued the order.''
</P>
<P>
   In language study, nothing beats a good illustration. A precept
without an example is like a verb without an object: pale, flat and
intransitive. In a column on  &UR; short shrift &LR; , rooted in the archaism
of a prisoner's being hastily shriven (confession heard and
absolution given) before his execution, I asked Jim for other
``fossilized expressions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand a  &UR; fossilized expression &LR;  to be one that was once
an instance of a productive syntactic construction,'' he reported
back, ``and which has survived even though either that construction
or the words in the expression or the relevant meanings of those
words haven't.'' As an example of old words now bereft of meaning
but still in use, he suggested `` &UR; to wit &LR; , where the word _  &UR; wit &LR; ,
as a verb meaning `know' _ has been lost.''
</P>
<P>
   His example of a vestigial construction in a  &UR; fossilized
expression &LR;  used his favorite technique of proving something about
what is said by what the brain refuses to let the tongue say:
`` &UR; Long live the King! &LR;  There the words survive but the
construction doesn't. You don't say  &UR; Loud laugh the audience! &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   Although an early report said that McCawley died at 61 ``of an
apparent heart attack,'' Margalit Fox, an obituary writer at The
New York Times, apparently remembered the grammatical admonition of
Stanley Walker, of The New York Herald Tribune, to his copy
editors: ``Nobody ever died of an apparent heart attack.'' Ms.
Fox's sparkling obit reported, ``The apparent cause was a heart
attack, university officials said.'' The scrupulous McCawley would
have approved.

THE BLAME GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Immediately after the Senate refused to convict
President Clinton on the House impeachment charges, congressional
leaders of both parties solemnly vowed to put the partisan
bitterness behind them and work together in the national interest.
</P>
<P>
   Back on Feb. 12 the Democrats were chastened by the president's
close call, and the Republicans were alarmed about public
disapproval of their sex-and-lies vendetta. Both needed a respite.
</P>
<P>
   Forget it. That was two and a half months ago and this is now.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO bombing of Yugoslavia has exposed the permanent reality
of Washington politics in the convulsive Clinton era. The
congressional Republican majority hates the president and is still
trying to do him in, even if it makes the GOP look foolish again in
the process. Call it Impeachment II.
</P>
<P>
   The House performed the ludicrous stunt last week of refusing to
support the air war or the use of ground troops while also refusing
to advocate withdrawal. Don't stay, don't go. Hide in the rabbit
hole.
</P>
<P>
   The House then topped that preposterous muddle by voting to
appropriate twice as much money as the president had requested to
bolster the military's ability to wage the very war for which it
had ducked any responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican majority had some Democratic help in this crazy,
cowardly exercise, but it was essentially a GOP strategy to
embarrass and undermine Clinton by isolating him. And the
philosophically divided Senate is going down the same circuitous
path, on Monday tabling, or setting aside, a resolution that had
seemed destined to lose which would have given the president a free
hand as commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   These contortions are as much about domestic politics as about
foreign policy, appeasement, humanitarian instincts, NATO prestige
and individual conscience.
</P>
<P>
   The president who remained popular during the whole Monica
Lewinsky mess is finally falling in the opinion polls over public
discontent with the uncertain war. One poll now puts his approval
rating on Kosovo at 46 percent _ still respectable but no longer
impressive. And that makes him newly vulnerable to his foes.
</P>
<P>
   This time he could take down Vice President Al Gore with him.
Gore could not be tarred with skirt-chasing, but he is stuck with
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are not concealing their base motivation. They
don't trust Clinton and therefore won't endorse his conduct of the
military exercise, no matter what it is. Oddly, Secretary of
Defense William Cohen, a respected former GOP senator, doesn't
count for anything in this political equation. Once admired as a
military expert, he suffers from guilt by association.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives call it ``Clinton's war,'' as though Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic is just an innocent bystander in the
Kosovo crisis rather than the cause of it all. In arguing with
Democrats, they refer to Clinton as ``your president,'' meaning not
theirs and rejecting the outcome of the last election. Respect for
the institution of the presidency is yet another casualty of
partisan bickering.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Clinton is blameless in all this. He has given Capitol
Hill plenty to distrust him about. He has not appeared sure-footed
in his defense of the hapless Kosovars, and most of us can't figure
out just what is going on over there. Is the NATO bombing making
headway or merely making things worse?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton says he is not asking for ``total victory,'' just
``minimal conditions'' to allow the Kosovars to go home, meaning
some sort of armed international security force to protect them
after a withdrawal of Milosevic's thugs. He also talks about ``a
measure of autonomy,'' which Kosovo had before Milosevic's assault.
</P>
<P>
   This is not exactly a ringing call to arms and is not quite what
he originally described as his ultimate goal. But Kosovo, like
Clinton himself, is a work in progress. To accept that this
exercise in firepower will work out okay, you have to trust the
president to know what he is doing. The Republicans are mean and
stupid but they have a point.
</P>
<P>
   The other day President Lyndon Johnson's oil portrait was
finally hung in Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle's office
beside those of other Democratic presidents of the modern era. In
unveiling the picture, Daschle noted Johnson's remarkable
legislative achievements, which alone would have defined a great
presidency. LBJ broke traditional barriers blocking federal aid to
education, initiated Medicare and Medicaid, mandated civil rights
in public facilities and equal rights in the voting booth, and
launched an ambitious war on poverty.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson's domestic legacy was overwhelmed by the disastrous
Vietnam War. By mismanaging it he squandered his place in history.
A generation despised it as ``Johnson's war'' _ although it was
also John Kennedy's and Richard Nixon's.
</P>
<P>
   This is what could happen to Clinton, already weakened by the
impeachment charade. In some ways Clinton is more like LBJ than
JFK, his own favorite for comparison purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment stemmed from his personal behavior, but warfare
is a different matter. Now Clinton is trapped in ugly circumstances
not of his making, as Johnson was, and has no good options.

MOVIEMAKING TALENT BEHIND `TERMINATOR 2: 3D' REALLY SHOWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Terminator 2: 3D'' may not technically be
state-of-the-art, reach-out-and-grab-ya cinema. It's been running
at the Universal Studios theme park in Florida for three years, and
somebody, somewhere must have improved on the machinery since then.
</P>
<P>
   But no one is going to top the combined creative expertise of
co-directors James Cameron, multi-Oscar-winning makeup maven Stan
Winston and special-effects expert John Bruno for some time to
come. At a reportedly record-setting cost per each of its 12
minutes, ``T2:3D'' not only delivers megabang for the megabucks, it
works up immensely imaginative depth tricks and awesome sci-fi
spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   The film is the centerpiece of an attraction at Universal
Studios Hollywood that opens to the public on Thursday. The show
comes complete with a waiting area designed to resemble the
headquarters of Cyberdyne Systems (the company that builds the
mankind-hating computers), a nauseatingly chirpy corporate hostess
(whose subsequent, cheer-inducing demise makes for ironic fun in
the midst of Universal's corporate entertainment complex) and some
live-action rebels who shoot off guns and drive motorcycles through
the auditorium. The theater seats move slightly, but it's only a
smidgen of the hydraulic action you experience at Disneyland's Star
Tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``T2:3D'' is primarily a visual experience, and it's a short but
splendid one. Featuring the stars of Cameron's 1991 feature
``Terminator 2: Judgment Day,'' Arnold Schwarzenegger and Edward
Furlong, it's a trip from today into the ruined future of 2026,
when Cyberdyne's massive Skynet computer has just about succeeded
in wiping out the human race with its demonic war machines.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarzenegger's heroically reprogrammed superandroid and his
young charge barrel across the blasted landscape on a Harley,
blowing away pursuing hovercraft and skeletal metal terminators as
they go. They're stalked by miniature floating hunters _ silvery
disks that make wonderful 3-D skeet targets _ as they navigate the
rubble outside Skynet's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Once our heroes descend into the belly of the mechanical beast,
extra screens open up, a gigantic spiderlike terminator made of
that liquid metal comes at them (and us), and Arnold saves the
world while making bad, deadpan puns. It's a descent into
wraparound, high-tech hell.
</P>
<P>
   True, there's not much of a story here. Indeed, ``T2:3D'' isn't
even logically the sequel to ``Judgment Day'' it claims to be,
since both the Arnold terminator and Skynet chip were destroyed at
the end of that movie.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the purest 12 minutes of sheer adrenaline immersion
ever filmed. Cameron's cameras move with a speed and agility never
before seen in 3-D, the stereoscopic effects are thoroughly
integrated into the action, and the chillingly beautiful design
elements could not have been realized more convincingly.
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to pay for the rest of the Universal park in order
to see ``T2:3D.'' And you'll have to pass through a storeful of T2
merchandise on your way out of the theater. Some might consider
that a high price for techno-artistic progress. But most will
likely wonder why every dozen minutes of movie can't be as exciting
as these, regardless of what they cost. &UR;  &QL;

   KOSOVO-STRIKES _ WASHINGTON _ The pressure is now on President
Clinton as he prepares to meet with Russian special envoy Victor
Chernomyrdin and receives a letter from Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic via the Rev. Jesse jackson. This, as the latest in the
continually escalating U.S.-led NATO bombing of Serb military

<P>
   KOSOVO-CONGRESS _ WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Monday debates a
resolution by Sen. John McCain authorizing President Clinton to use
``all necessary force'' to prevail in the Balkans. Ater a debate
stretching into the evening, the Senate is expected to table the
motion, adding yet another element of certainty to congressional
support of the war effort. (Malone, Cox News Service). 25.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-CAMP _ KUKES, Albania _ Their refugees have hot meals and
electricity in every tent. Their field hospital soon will boast a
full-scale operating theater. Now the managers of the so-called
``Arab camp'' are finishing an airstrip that could receive the
first C-130 loaded with their supplies as early as Tuesday, and
will be improved enough within weeks to serve as a forward base for
NATO war planes. They are relative newcomers to the world of
big-time international humanitarian aid, but the United Arab
Emirates are building a show-stopper. (Kunstel, Cox News Service).

   GORE-DONORS _ ATLANTA _ Vice President Al Gore raised nearly as
much money in Georgia as the entire field of Republican
presidential candidates, according to a computer-assisted analysis
of Georgia donations in the first quarter of 1999. Texas Gov.
George W. Bush led the GOP field, followed by Elizabeth Dole and
Gary Bauer. While the race is still early, the donations show that
Bush has the best fund-raising organization in the Peach state with
the potential to raise even larger sums in the months ahead.
Bauer's strong third-place showing indicates that the conservative
think tank founder is winning the battle to attract conservative
voters over former vice president Dan Quayle and publisher Steve
Forbes, both of whom are vying for conservative votes in Georgia.
Two Atlanta law firms, Alston &AMP;Bird and Troutman,Sanders, have been
unusually active donors. (Foskett, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   w/GORE-BELLSOUTH _ ATLANTA _ Vice President Al Gore wanted to
make a strong statement in his first presidential filing. Georgia's
BellSouth wanted to make one of their own. Over four days,
BellSouth executives chipped in more than $45,000 in personal
donations to Gore, one of the biggest corporate contributions to
Gore anywhere in the country. The telecom company, which has a long
history of supporting Republicans, says the Tennessee Democrat and
technology junkie understands their issues better than anyone else.

   PHONE-CHARGE-DEBATE _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Pressure and frustrations
are growing for those involved in telephone access charge fight.
One lawmaker told the House State Affairs Committee last week that
some had characterized her as ``a 'ho'' for Southwestern Bell
because her bill is seen as favoring that company. The chairman of
the committee, Rep. Steve Wolens, left the hearing infuriated
because he could not get questions answered and Bell appeared to be
claiming support for the bill that it didn't have. And those TV ads
are generating constituent pressure to do something. The committee
is expected to complete its hearing on Monday, but no action will
be taken yet. (Hight, Austin American-Statesman)

THE BLAME GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: CORRECTS 7th graf to reflect that the Senate did not table
the ``all necessary force'' resolution Monday but is expected to do
so Tuesday.)

 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Immediately after the Senate refused to convict
President Clinton on the House impeachment charges, congressional
leaders of both parties solemnly vowed to put the partisan
bitterness behind them and work together in the national interest.
</P>
<P>
   Back on Feb. 12 the Democrats were chastened by the president's
close call, and the Republicans were alarmed about public
disapproval of their sex-and-lies vendetta. Both needed a respite.
</P>
<P>
   Forget it. That was two and a half months ago and this is now.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO bombing of Yugoslavia has exposed the permanent reality
of Washington politics in the convulsive Clinton era. The
congressional Republican majority hates the president and is still
trying to do him in, even if it makes the GOP look foolish again in
the process. Call it Impeachment II.
</P>
<P>
   The House performed the ludicrous stunt last week of refusing to
support the air war or the use of ground troops while also refusing
to advocate withdrawal. Don't stay, don't go. Hide in the rabbit
hole.
</P>
<P>
   The House then topped that preposterous muddle by voting to
appropriate twice as much money as the president had requested to
bolster the military's ability to wage the very war for which it
had ducked any responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican majority had some Democratic help in this crazy,
cowardly exercise, but it was essentially a GOP strategy to
embarrass and undermine Clinton by isolating him. And the
philosophically divided Senate is going down the same circuitous
path. On Tuesday it is expected to table, or set aside, a
resolution that seemed destined to lose which would give the
president a free hand as commander-in-chief to use ``all necessary
force'' in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   These contortions are as much about domestic politics as about
foreign policy, appeasement, humanitarian instincts, NATO prestige
and individual conscience.
</P>
<P>
   The president who remained popular during the whole Monica
Lewinsky mess is finally falling in the opinion polls over public
discontent with the uncertain war. One poll now puts his approval
rating on Kosovo at 46 percent _ still respectable but no longer
impressive. And that makes him newly vulnerable to his foes.
</P>
<P>
   This time he could take down Vice President Al Gore with him.
Gore could not be tarred with skirt-chasing, but he is stuck with
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are not concealing their base motivation. They
don't trust Clinton and therefore won't endorse his conduct of the
military exercise, no matter what it is. Oddly, Secretary of
Defense William Cohen, a respected former GOP senator, doesn't
count for anything in this political equation. Once admired as a
military expert, he suffers from guilt by association.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives call it ``Clinton's war,'' as though Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic is just an innocent bystander in the
Kosovo crisis rather than the cause of it all. In arguing with
Democrats, they refer to Clinton as ``your president,'' meaning not
theirs and rejecting the outcome of the last election. Respect for
the institution of the presidency is yet another casualty of
partisan bickering.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Clinton is blameless in all this. He has given Capitol
Hill plenty to distrust him about. He has not appeared sure-footed
in his defense of the hapless Kosovars, and most of us can't figure
out just what is going on over there. Is the NATO bombing making
headway or merely making things worse?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton says he is not asking for ``total victory,'' just
``minimal conditions'' to allow the Kosovars to go home, meaning
some sort of armed international security force to protect them
after a withdrawal of Milosevic's thugs. He also talks about ``a
measure of autonomy,'' which Kosovo had before Milosevic's assault.
</P>
<P>
   This is not exactly a ringing call to arms and is not quite what
he originally described as his ultimate goal. But Kosovo, like
Clinton himself, is a work in progress. To accept that this
exercise in firepower will work out okay, you have to trust the
president to know what he is doing. The Republicans are mean and
stupid but they have a point.
</P>
<P>
   The other day President Lyndon Johnson's oil portrait was
finally hung in Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle's office
beside those of other Democratic presidents of the modern era. In
unveiling the picture, Daschle noted Johnson's remarkable
legislative achievements, which alone would have defined a great
presidency. LBJ broke traditional barriers blocking federal aid to
education, initiated Medicare and Medicaid, mandated civil rights
in public facilities and equal rights in the voting booth, and
launched an ambitious war on poverty.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson's domestic legacy was overwhelmed by the disastrous
Vietnam War. By mismanaging it he squandered his place in history.
A generation despised it as ``Johnson's war'' _ although it was
also John Kennedy's and Richard Nixon's.
</P>
<P>
   This is what could happen to Clinton, already weakened by the
impeachment charade. In some ways Clinton is more like LBJ than
JFK, his own favorite for comparison purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment stemmed from his personal behavior, but warfare
is a different matter. Now Clinton is trapped in ugly circumstances
not of his making, as Johnson was, and has no good options.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clouds swirling around a sluggish low pressure zone south of
Long Island on Tuesday will cover most areas from the northern
Appalachians to the Middle Atlantic Coast. Patchy rain and drizzle
will dampen much of the region, especially near the coast. Active
onshore breezes blowing across the chilly waters of the Atlantic
will keep temperatures far below the seasonal average along the
coast from southern New England to Virginia. Farther west,
steadfast high pressure will promote another mild day with ample
sunshine across the eastern part of the Great Lakes and Ohio
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A powerful jet stream disturbance will cause potent
thunderstorms with high wind gusts to sweep from northeastern Texas
and eastern parts of Kansas and Oklahoma early Tuesday into
Missouri, Arkansas and Iowa in the afternoon and evening. Strong,
shifting winds between the ground and 20,000 feet will impart
rotation to some of the storms raising the risk of tornadoes.
Farther north, variable clouds and some showers and thunderstorms
will precede a front in the eastern Dakotas and Minnesota. In the
wake of the front, clouds, scattered showers and cool breezes from
the north will prevail in much of the western Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Cool and unsettled weather will persist over the Northwestern
States. Clouds and a mixture of rain and snow showers will be
common along west-facing mountain slopes from the Cascades to the
northern Rockies. A mix of sun and clouds will occur in the lower
elevations. Meanwhile, the Southwest will be mainly sunny with
gusty breezes.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Topsy-Turvy Weather
</P>
<P>
   The mercury managed only 68 degrees at Orlando, Fla., on
Saturday, setting a record for the lowest high temperature ever
observed there on May 1. Meanwhile, temperatures soared to a record
79 degrees at Marquette, Mich., on Saturday. The reversal of the
normal north-to-south distribution of temperatures was accompanied
by a topsy-turvy distribution in barometric pressure, with a warm
high over the Great Lakes and a cold low over the Southeast. In
turn, prevailing winds from the west were replaced by moist winds
from the east, which fueled rain in the Carolinas over the weekend.

HAVE DESIGNS ON YOUR OWN WEB PAGE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HOYE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - What say we learn how to design a Web page? &QL; 
Aah, come on! It's easy! At least it's easier than filling out your
annual income tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   Why should you bother creating your own Web page? I can think of
several reasons. Here are two:
</P>
<P>
   1) The Web is an invaluable tool for communicating with people
in your neighborhood and around the world. Be a part of it!
</P>
<P>
   2) You might already have free ``Web space'' at your disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Many Internet service providers offer their customers free
personal Web space, or room on a computer for storing Web pages.
America Online, for example, provides 2 megabytes for each screen
name on an account. Other ISPs offer 5, 10 or more megabytes per
user.
</P>
<P>
   As long as you don't go over the limit, there should be no
additional charge for using this personal Web space. So why not use
it?
</P>
<P>
   Check with your ISP to see if your monthly access fee includes
Web space. And learn your ISP's Web-page rules. Can you design from
scratch? Or must you use a template? Is the free Web space strictly
for personal use? Or can you use it to sell your homemade salad
dressing? Are there space and content restrictions?
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of content: Don't think your Web page needs to include
something earth-shattering, such as a cure for cancer. Put up
pictures of the grandkids or the dog. List links to your favorite
Web sites. Share family news. Display your artwork. Make a page for
your child's class. Write your life story. Post your resume. Tell
jokes.
</P>
<P>
   The point in creating a personal Web page is to have fun, not
worry about how many visitors you will get. Certainly, it's good to
get lots of visitors, and that can be a goal. But don't think that
it's a requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Have I convinced you yet? Yes? Good. Starting with this column,
we'll spend a few weeks looking at how to create simple Web pages.
We will cover the basics _ enough to get you started.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to learn more than is presented here, there are many
avenues for you to follow.
</P>
<P>
   There are Web sites that cover beginning and advanced design. A
couple sites for beginners include junior.apk.net/jbarta/tutor/ or
home.earthlink.net/thomasareed/pixelpen/. (Note that neither
address has ``www'' at the beginning. Also, both contain tildes.)
</P>
<P>
   There also are many books available. My favorites include ``HTML
4 for the World Wide Web'' by Elizabeth Castro, published by
Peachpit Press, and ``HTML 4 for Dummies'' by Ed Tittel and Stephen
N. James, published by IDG Books.
</P>
<P>
   What do you need to design Web pages? Not much. Any text-editing
program will do. Notepad, supplied with Windows, works just fine.
The only other thing you will need is a browser. Whether it's
Netscape's Navigator or Microsoft's Internet Explorer makes no
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Many people use HTML editing software, such as CoffeeCup HTML
Design Editor. These programs make it easier to write HTML, the
language of Web pages. But they are not required.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, many people use Web-page design software, such as
FrontPage 98. You can use these fancy _ and sometimes expensive _
programs to design pages without having to know HTML. But they can
be tricky to learn. And, again, they are not required for what we
will attempt here.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another tip before we get started: You can view the HTML
behind nearly any page you find on the Web! Windows users need only
right-click on an open portion of a Web page and choose ``View
Source.'' Macintosh users can do the same via a drop-down menu.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the HTML, or ``source code,'' of a page can make you
dizzy, especially if it's a complex page. But you can also get some
good ideas from what other people have done. Like the way a page
looks? View the source code to see how they did it.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what is HTML? It stands for ``HyperText Markup
Language.'' It's a $500 term that describes a 50-cent concept: The
text markers _ or tags _ that make things appear certain ways on
Web pages are written in a certain style, otherwise known as HTML.
</P>
<P>
   So how's it work? Think bookends. You want to keep a handful of
books upright on a shelf? You need two bookends _ one on the left,
one on the right. HTML works the same way. There is an opening
version and a closing version of most HTML tags. The stuff you put
between the opening and closing tags _ the content _ is affected by
the tags on either side.
</P>
<P>
   All opening tags are letters and/or numbers sandwiched between a
less-than symbol and a greater-than symbol. Closing tags are built
the same way, except they include a forward slash (/) after the
less-than symbol.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the opening tag that makes text appear in bold face
is b. The closing tag is /b. Want to make the word ``test'' appear
in bold? Do it like this: btest/b. Get it? Generally, this is how
all HTML tags work.
</P>
<P>
   A handy list of the most common HTML tags and what they do can
be found at www.willcam.com/cmat/html/crossref.html.
</P>
<P>
   Some HTML tags carry attributes and values. To set a specific
font for your page, you use the font tag with an attribute and a
value that lists the name of the font you want used. In this
example _ font face``arial'' _ ``font'' is the tag, ``face'' is the
attribute and ``arial'' is the value.
</P>
<P>
   As you get further into creating Web pages, you will learn that
you can use HTML tags together. This is called nesting tags. For
example, you can make the word ``test'' appear in both bold and
itallic like this: bitest/i/b.
</P>
<P>
   Notice the order in which the opening and closing tags appear in
the above example. This is important. You should always close the
most recently opened tag first.
</P>
<P>
   Say you want to create a Web page with blue text (font
color``blue'', /font), and you want a headline (h1, /h1) at the top
of your page with the words in itallic (i, /i).
</P>
<P>
   It would look like this: font color``blue''h1iThis is the
headline/i/h1/font.
</P>
<P>
   Let's make a quick page!
</P>
<P>
   Open a blank page in your text editor. Type an opening HTML tag
like this html. Then type an opening title tag like this title.
Type a title that will appear at the top of the browser window when
your page is viewed. Then, type /title.
</P>
<P>
   Next, type an opening body tag like this body.
</P>
<P>
   Then, skip down a ways and type a closing body tag like this
/body and a closing HTML tag like this /html. This is the structure
of a very basic Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Now, your page is ready for content, which goes between the
opening and closing body tags. Add anything. Type a sentence. Since
this is just a test page, have fun and experiment. Check the Web
page listed above for HTML tags to try.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a tip: An opening paragraph tag looks like this p. Use it
to add space between paragraphs. You can add a closing tag like
this /p, but it's usually not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Remember to close the most recently opened tags first. And leave
the /body and /html tags at the bottom. Don't put any content below
them.
</P>
<P>
   When you save your page, give it a short first name followed by
``.html'' as in ``test.html.'' If you don't specify the ``html''
part, Notepad will call it ``txt'' and your browser will not open
the page properly.
</P>
<P>
   To view your page, open your browser (you don't have to go
online). In Navigator, click FILE and OPEN PAGE. Then click CHOOSE
FILE. Find test.html (or whatever you called your page) and
double-click on it. Then, click OPEN. Your page should open.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Explorer works the same way, except you click on BROWSE
instead of CHOOSE FILE, and OK instead of OPEN.
</P>
<P>
   View your page as you go. It's fun to experiment with a new tag,
save the file and then see what the results look like in your
browser. Remember to hit RELOAD or REFRESH to make your browser
redisplay your page after you've made changes.
</P>
<P>
   That's it for this week. Next week, we'll look at more basics,
including how to create links and how to make your pages more
colorful.
</P>
<P>
   Are you dizzy yet? I hope not! &QL;

`PARADE' TOPS TONY NOMINATION FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Parade,'' a critical and commercial failure, led Monday's Tony
field with nine nominations; a play by the late Tennessee Williams
was nominated as the best new play of the year; ``Wit,'' the
Pulitzer-Prize winning drama, was ruled ineligible; and all three
of David Hare's plays were shut out in the best-play category, as
was the highly regarded ``The Weir.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's Tony time, with all the attendant Byzantine rules and
controversial omissions and commissions. The musical nominations
were real head-scratchers. That the incidental score for ``Twelfth
Night'' was nominated for best musical is one indication of how
weak the field is this year for both revivals and new work. On the
other hand, it was a particularly rich year for drama.
</P>
<P>
   Williams's ``Not About Nightingales'' was considered a new play
by the Tony committee because it had not been produced before.
Vanessa Redgrave discovered it among Williams's papers and brought
it to the National Theatre in England, who coproduced it with
Houston's Alley Theatre. Her brother, Corin, who starred in it, is
one of the play's six nominees, along with Trevor Nunn, the
director who's also head of the National.
</P>
<P>
   That means that Williams won't be competing with fellow American
masters Eugene O'Neill and Arthur Miller. O'Neill's ``The Iceman
Cometh'' and Miller's ``Death of a Salesman'' are the favorites in
the revival category and its highly regarded stars, Kevin Spacey
and Brian Dennehy, will duke it out for best actor over Redgrave
and Brian O'Byrne of ``The Lonesome West.'' ``Salesman'' also had
six nominations, ``Iceman'' five. Miller, incidentally, will
receive a lifetime achievement award as will Uta Hagen and
executive Isabelle Stevenson, who coordinates the Tonys.
</P>
<P>
   Two classics, ``Electra'' and ``Twelfth Night,'' round out the
revival category. Zoe Wanamaker was nominated for the former, but
Helen Hunt was not nominated for the latter. Warren Leight's ``Side
Man,'' Patrick Marber's ``Closer,'' and, surprisingly, Martin
McDonagh's ``Lonesome West'' were the other new-play nominees.
``Side Man'' might have the legs to win here since it's a new
American play, although ``Closer'' is the class of this category.
``Wit'' was not eligible because it has not been playing in a
theater large enough to be considered a Broadway stage.
</P>
<P>
   The Tony nominations clearly show that Broadway does not have
the economic or emotional wherewithal to produce serious plays any
longer. Except for ``Twelfth Night,'' all the nominees originated
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Regional theaters _ the Goodman in Chicago and the Alley in
Houston _ produced or coproduced ``Salesman'' and ``Nightingales,''
respectively. ``Side Man'' transferred from off-Broadway. The rest
proved themselves in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   In the musical categories, Livent, the producing company that
went bankrupt, got some good news Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``Parade,'' the musical it coproduced about the
Leo Frank lynching, ``Fosse'' the musical homage had eight
nominations. Frank Wildhorn's ``The Civil War'' was also nominated,
but look for ``Fosse'' or the acclaimed underdog, ``It Ain't
Nothin' but the Blues'' to win this one. In fact, Don Sebesky's
orchestrations might be the only award ``Parade'' takes home.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its lackluster reviews, ``Annie Get Your Gun'' with
Bernadette Peters could take the revival award. There's a
been-there, done that feel to the well-produced ``Peter Pan'' with
Cathy Rigby; ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'' wasn't any better
received than ``Annie . . .''; and ``Little Me'' could be the
dictionary definition of mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Oscar winner Judi Dench will look to add a Tony to
the shelf for ``Amy's View,'' but Nicole Kidman was not nominated
for ``The Blue Room.'' The awards are June 6 and the search is
still on for a host to replace Rosie O'Donnell. If you're looking
to bet the mortgage, put your money on Bernadette Peters in
``Annie'' and Elizabeth Franz as Willy Loman's wife in
``Salesman.''

`ANOTHER WORLD': GHOSTS, AND NOT THE FRIENDLY KIND 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In her critically acclaimed trilogy (``Regeneration,'' ``The Eye
in the Door'' and ``The Ghost Road''), the English writer Pat
Barker worked an artful improvisation on the lives of the poets
Siegfried Sassoon, Wilfred Owen and Robert Graves and their World
War I compatriots to produce a powerful antiwar fiction that probed
the lasting emotional consequences of combat.
</P>
<P>
   Her latest novel, ``Another World,'' examines a related theme _
the hold of time past over time present _ through the prism of
three generations of a family living in Newcastle. Though Ms.
Barker has larded their story with portentous symbolism and some
specious talk of ghosts, her keen attention to psychological detail
enables her to reveal how these people's daily lives proceed in the
``shadow of monstrosities,'' in the shadow of death and loss and
casual cruelty, in the shadow of betrayal and self-deception.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 101, the family patriarch, Geordie, is reliving
the horrors of World War I as he lies in his sickbed; he is
convinced that he is dying from a bayonet wound received during the
war, not from the stomach cancer that is eating away at his body.
Almost every night he suffers terrible flashbacks that take him
back to the trenches of France, where his brother Harry died in
1916. Geordie blames himself for Harry's death; he remembers his
mother saying at Harry's memorial service, ``It should have been
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Geordie's grandson Nick is also grappling with fallout from the
past. Although Nick and his wife, Fran, have just settled into a
new house with their 2-year-old, Jasper, and have another baby on
the way, their fragile family harmony has been disrupted by their
stepchildren. Fran's hostile son, Gareth, spends all his free time
playing violent video games and trying to undermine his stepfather
(his favorite ploy is to run Nick's toothbrush under the toilet
bowl rim before replacing it in its holder), while Nick's teen-age
daughter, Miranda, nurses secret resentments and fears. She finds
it hard to forgive Nick for leaving her mother, who has been
hospitalized for depression.
</P>
<P>
   Though Nick's comfortably middle-class family enjoys a
considerably cushier life than the working-class characters in Ms.
Barker's gritty early novels (``The Century's Daughter,'' ``Blow
Your House Down'' and ``Union Street''), its members are subject to
the same sense that life is short, nasty and brutish. As Ms.
Barker's plot unfurls, we are made to see that the customary family
bonds of loyalty and devotion are often illusory, that love,
particularly fraternal love, can be highly conditional.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Ms. Barker's characters learn that mortality
lurks behind every endeavor, be it service in the Great War or a
simple family outing to the beach. For Nick, in particular, time
increasingly seems to move on fast forward. ``He seems to be living
in one of those speeded-up sequences beloved of wildlife
photographers,'' Ms. Barker writes. ``Fran's stomach swelling, the
children growing, the house rose blooming and decaying, Geordie
dwindling into death before his eyes. Time must move at a constant
pace, he supposes, but that's not how we experience it.''
</P>
<P>
   To symbolize the power the past continues to exert over the
present, Ms. Barker has contrived a macabre set piece that proves
as gratuitous as it is initially gripping: While removing the old
wallpaper in their living room, Nick and his family uncover an old
mural on the wall. It is a haunting and obscene painting of the
Fanshawe family, who previously owned the house _ a family, like
Nick's, with one young child and two older step-siblings _ a
family, Nick will later learn, at the center of a grisly murder.
When Miranda sees the mural, she darkly announces, ``It's us.''
</P>
<P>
   This heavy-handed attempt to draw parallels between the Fanshawe
family and Nick's not only proves to be a large red herring, but is
also a sensationalistic distraction from the moving story of Nick's
efforts to come to terms with Geordie and Geordie's efforts to come
to terms with his earlier life. It is also a distraction from the
very real virtues of this novel: Ms. Barker's nuanced depiction of
her characters' interior lives, her unsentimental rendering of
their daily travails and her finely calibrated delineation of the
workings of memory. In the end the visceral power of her writing
steamrollers the novel's very evident flaws, a novel, one hopes,
that will win this talented writer a wider audience in the United
States and send readers back to her earlier work.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ America's aging space shuttles, often
criticized as monuments to 1970s technology, are slowly being
replaced by much more modern spacecraft _ themselves.
</P>
<P>
   With the possible exception of a few science fiction
counterparts, the nation's fleet of space shuttles, which began
flying humans into space 18 years ago, have become the most
recognized spaceships in the world. The stubby-winged spaceplanes,
with twin rocket boosters and giant fuel tanks strapped to their
bellies, appear little changed since the first one flew in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   But appearances can be deceiving. The shuttles have been
steadily modified during their lifetimes, NASA engineers and
managers say, and are much more modern beneath their familiar skin
than most people realize.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttles underwent numerous, highly publicized safety
modifications after the Challenger explosion in 1986 took the lives
of seven crew members. These changes, among thousands of major and
minor design modifications that were made since the shuttles
started flying, included redesigned solid-fuel booster rockets,
more spacecraft sensors and a parachute escape system for the crew.
</P>
<P>
   But later improvements that have not drawn as much attention
include new main engines that engineers say are safer and more
reliable because they have far fewer welded parts and operate under
lower pressures; external fuel tanks made of a new, lighter
aluminum-lithium alloy, providing a 7,500-pound weight reduction
that translates into increased cargo capacity; improved brakes and
the addition of tail parachutes for surer, shorter landings, and
added protection against the impact of orbital debris to the
leading edges of the wings and heat radiators inside the cargo bay
doors.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate the evolving shuttle, officials at the Kennedy
Space Center here showed off the shuttle Atlantis on Thursday,
giving journalists unprecedented access to the orbiter, which
recently completed a major upgrade. During a 10-month, $70 million
overhaul, the Atlantis was taken out of flight rotation and given
more than 130 major modifications while being disassembled,
cleaned, tested and put back together again. Such reconditioning
typically occurs every four or five years.
</P>
<P>
   The 86-ton spaceplane returned to Kennedy last September from a
Boeing plant in Palmdale, Calif., weighing 1,000 pounds less and
full of enhancements, including a modern cockpit with digital
display screens and a new navigation system and other electronics
that rival the latest airliners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new cockpit is a major improvement and should make the
shuttle much easier and safer to fly,'' said Col. James D. Halsell
Jr. of the Air Force, who will command the Atlantis on its first
mission after the overhaul, a supply flight to the international
space station tentatively set for December.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a white ``clean room'' suit that includes a hood over
his head to prevent stray hairs from contaminating the Atlantis'
near-sterile environment, Halsell showed similarly clad visitors
the shuttle's new ``glass cockpit.'' Gone are four black-and-white
cathode ray television screens and numerous mechanical instruments
and gauges, replaced by an array of color active-matrix displays
like those found on portable computers.
</P>
<P>
   The nine flat-screen displays in front of the pilots, plus two
more in the rear cockpit, can be programmed to show all kinds of
flight information and sensor data.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle pilots said the new displays, each with a square
6.7-inch viewing area showing better organized and color-coded
data, should help them to obtain and understand information more
quickly during the critical eight-and-a-half-minute trip from
takeoff to orbit and subsequent landing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cockpit displays are the most visible sign of changes in
the shuttles, but a lot of the other modifications will be of huge
benefit to the crews,'' said Lt. Col. Scott J. Horowitz, who will
pilot the Atlantis on its next flight. ``The shuttle will be flying
for a long time because nothing else can do its job. This thing
will outlive my career and a lot of other people's, too.''
</P>
<P>
   With continued updating, officials say, these shuttles could
conceivably fly for another 20 or 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Elric McHenry, the shuttle program development manager, said
Congress and the Clinton administration would soon decide what to
do about a replacement for the shuttle. But whatever the decision,
he said, the shuttle fleet would continue to fly for at least a
decade, and probably longer, because there are no alternatives on
the immediate horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's prudent for the shuttle program to assume that for the
next 10 years, we will be it,'' McHenry said at a news briefing,
``and I personally believe we will fly much longer than that.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Other space experts agree. Dr. John M. Logsdon, director of the
Space Policy Institute at George Washington University in
Washington, said that the only shuttle alternatives that existed
were on paper and that he believed the current spacecraft would
continue flying for 15 to 20 years. ``The shuttle is the only
re-usable, manned spacecraft that we've got,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John E. Pike, space policy expert for the Federation of American
Scientists, said the shuttle could be the spacecraft equivalent of
the much-modified B-52 bomber, which the Air Force recently said
could remain in service more than 70 years after its introduction.
``The shuttle could continue flying like the B-52, with the only
limit being its airframe life,'' Pike said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel S. Goldin, the administrator of NASA, said the
versatility of the shuttle made it difficult to find alternatives,
particularly for servicing the international space station now
being constructed in orbit. People have suggested alternative
vehicles that would only carry crews to and from the station, or
that would serve as unpiloted cargo haulers, but no proposal is up
to all the shuttle's jobs, he told reporters last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shuttle is a rocket for eight-and-a-half minutes capable
of carrying a crew and cargo, but the shuttle is also a spacecraft
that can operate independently in space for eight to 14 days,''
Goldin said. If a major problem occurred aboard the space station
that required outside repairs, he said, there would be a need for a
craft like the shuttle, in which crews could live and work for long
periods.
</P>
<P>
   Officials noted that the shuttle fleet was still less than
one-fourth of the way through its design lifetime and that
continued modernization was making it safer, more capable and less
expensive to fly with each year. Each of the $2 billion shuttles
was designed for 100 flights and the most used orbiters, the
Columbia and Discovery, had so far flown 25 missions each.
</P>
<P>
   While the shuttles technically could fly for 30 more years with
updating, McHenry said the program probably would not last that
long for economic reasons. As new technology, like different types
of engines or electronics, emerges for better, cheaper spacecraft,
he said, it might make more economic sense to apply it to a new
vehicle rather than adapt it to the shuttles.
</P>
<P>
   NASA spends about $100 million a year to develop and install
modifications and upgrades for the orbiter fleet, McHenry said. For
example, the agency spent about $200 million to develop the
equipment and software for the new cockpit, he said, including $9
million to install it in Atlantis. It should cost slightly less to
put the new flight deck into each of the other shuttles as they
come up for refitting.
</P>
<P>
   McHenry said NASA was considering numerous other modifications,
including installing a new system of jets, using less toxic fuels,
to control the shuttles in space, improving the life of the fuel
cells that generate electricity on missions and developing a new
front landing gear for better safety under hazardous landing
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Even more radical changes have been suggested, like replacing
the solid-fuel booster rockets with safer, liquid-fuel boosters
designed to fly back to their launching site. But with a projected
development cost of more than $5 billion, experts question whether
the investment would be worth it.

`THUG LIFE IN D.C.': WISDOM WON BEHIND BARS

   When we meet Aundrey Burno, he is behind bars in the District of
Columbia jail, talking through a towel that he wears as a mask. In
later meetings with Marc Levin and Daphne Pinkerson, producers of
``Thug Life in D.C.,'' Burno takes off the mask, but he never stops
talking.
</P>
<P>
   This 17-year-old has one subject: the rules of street life that
require quick and brutal retaliation to any threat or perceived
slight. It's not edifying talk, but as this incisive HBO
documentary follows Burno through the justice system, where so many
of the capital's young black men spend time, you can detect the
desperation behind the posturing.
</P>
<P>
   The jail's warden and a guard reflect on the inmates with stern
sympathy, and Burno's mother tries to give this son who never knew
his father the little support she can. But the one person who seems
to reach him is his younger brother, Kevin, who he fears will end
up in jail. In quiet conversations about the fate of the youths
they know, he tells Kevin, who is not yet in the dangerous teens,
``It's us who's killing us.'' He displays his manacles and says,
``You can't be me. ... You can be better than me.''
</P>
<P>
   As he strives to get through to Kevin, Burno, who spends 23
hours a day behind bars because he stabbed another inmate, seems to
be coming to a realization that his prized thug image has not
served him very well.
</P>
<P>
   Sentenced to 25 years to life for trying to murder a police
officer, he is last seen on his way to a maximum-security
institution in another state. He and this unsparing report leave
the fragile hope that Kevin will not follow.

   `MEDIA MATTERS': MORE OPINIONS THAN INFORMATION
</P>
<P>
   A new season of public television's now-and-then media series
begins Tuesday night with brief reports from here and there. Main
attention is given by Alex Jones, the earnest host, to an
examination of a conflict between The Cincinnati Enquirer and
Chiquita Brands International, based in that city. At issue is a
reporter's use of purloined voice-mail messages in an extended
expose of Chiquita. Since all the principals in the case are bound
to silence by an out-of-court settlement in which the newspaper
came out second best, we hear mostly from people with more opinions
than information.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday night's bill: a frothy visit by American
cartoonists to Cuba; a look at efforts to revitalize the Times
Mirror Corp., and results of a survey on journalistic ethics.
Attention has evidently been paid to snazzing up the look of the
series; further attention to the content couldn't hurt.

 &HT;    ARAB ENTRY IN HUMANITARIAN AID ARENA IS A WINNER

<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ They still wade through mud when it rains. And
there's no disguising that they live in tents on the stony ground.
But Kosovar refugees lucky enough to stay at the cutting edge
``Arab camp'' are treated to a bounty of luxuries inconceivable
till now in the desolate domain of refugee life.
</P>
<P>
   They have hot chicken stew for lunch and electricity in every
tent. Some sleep on metal-spring beds. Their field hospital soon
will boast a full-scale operating theater.
</P>
<P>
   And on Monday afternoon five trucks loaded with gravel waited on
the edge of the narrow, potholed road bordering the camp to deal
with that mud problem that will reappear when the hot dry weather
gives way to summer storms.
</P>
<P>
   The managers of the so-called ``Arab camp'' are relative
newcomers to the world of big-time international humanitarian aid,
but the United Arab Emirates are building a show-stopper on what
was idle farmland just three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Obaid Al-Ketbi, commander of the military half of the
operation carried out in tandem with the UAE Red Crescent Society,
summed up the attitude in an interview Sunday:
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an open budget for this mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of refugee cars park daily outside the fence ringing the
camp on the southern outskirts of Kukes, and scores of newly
arrived Kosovar Albanian exiles routinely sit on the grass awaiting
word that there is room for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are told these are the best conditions, here in this camp.
We heard it is run by Muslim people,'' said Nasar Veliu, 25, who on
Sunday was moving his extended family of 15 people into one of the
massive UAE tents that measure at least 30 by 18 feet and can sleep
40.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that this latest of the Balkan tragedies has engulfed a
predominantly Muslim population may have helped attract the UAE
largesse, although Al-Ketbi said only that his country saw a need
and responded.
</P>
<P>
   The tent set aside for use as a mosque is not the only element
differentiating this Arab camp from the Greek or Italian or other
camps blossoming on swaths of undeveloped land around this city.
The camps here commonly are known by the country or organization
that finances and manages the set-up of tents, latrines, food
service and other logistics of emergency living.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   This camp will be the biggest. It now has about 400 tents
holding an estimated 5,000 refugees, and those numbers are expected
to double, Al-Ketbi said.
</P>
<P>
   All services are provided or contracted by the UAE, while other
camps normally congregate services from agencies such as the World
Food Programme and Medecins du Monde (Doctors of the World).
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to manage 100 percent by our own people,'' said
Al-Ketbi. ``We try to provide everything from the UAE government
and from our volunteers.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Saeed Al-bloushi, chief physician at the field hospital, has
up to 200 in-patient beds in tents. With justifiable pride he
described his facility as ``becoming a tertiary referral center for
the region,'' treating patients from other camps as well as local
Albanians sent from the Kukes hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The operating theater, radiology lab and first set of Kosovar
Albanian twins are expected to arrive any time, he said. The doctor
is comforted by the four camp generators that keep his lights and
new, state-of-the-art equipment on line.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most lavish and ultimately most impactive
expenditure is the airstrip that is expected to receive the first
C-130 loaded with UAE supplies this week. It will also be used by
NATO for humanitarian aid now, but will be improved enough to serve
eventually as a forward base for NATO war planes.
</P>
<P>
   Till now the UAE has flown supplies from its capital, Abu Dhabi
and from Europe to the Albanian capital Tirana, then sent them up
here via four UAE military helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Increased NATO use of the Tirana airport required the UAE to cut
back from four daily C-130 flights to only one or two, Al-Ketbi
said. So they decided to build up the old Albanian military air
strip about a mile down the road from the UAE camp. The C-130s will
fly here directly.
</P>
<P>
   The packed and graded airstrip is 950 meters long, or about half
a mile, said Lt. Col. Paolo Fregosi, the Italian lieutenant colonel
in charge of the NATO troops here as part of AFOR, the NATO
humanitarian aid mission. NATO troops already are based at the air
field and will run it.
</P>
<P>
   Radar and an imported control tower are yet to be installed, but
then the strip will be able to handle more traffic than a couple of
C-130s and NATO helicopters every day, Fregosi said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops plan to build a staging area to house refugees who
will be flown out, he said, as part of the effort to clear this
increasingly tense border area of the 100,000 refugees who could be
very vulnerable targets.
</P>
<P>
   After that, he suggested, the field could be used by NATO for
other purposes he would not specify.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for humanitarian purposes for the moment,'' said Fregosi.
``The future is in the hands of God.''

 &HT;    Hawks ready to do business
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Now, with the Hawks' regular season down to two games,
it's a question of needs and of what team responds best to
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks might have to win one more game _ tonight at Miami or
Wednesday against Washington in the Georgia Dome _ to hold onto
fourth place in the Eastern Conference. There also is the faint
hope of a Central Division title and No. 2 seed in the East, but
that scenario requires Cleveland to win at Indiana, plus two Hawks
victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to respond better (against Miami) than we did
against Cleveland,'' Hawks coach Lenny Wilkens promised after his
team struggled to put away the depleted Cavaliers 76-65 Sunday
night. He blamed the absence of energy and focus on Friday's
disappointment against the Pacers, a 92-90 overtime loss at home.
</P>
<P>
   Dikembe Mutombo agreed with his coach. ``We will be ready for
Miami,'' Mutombo said. ``You will see a different team. We know
what we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, the Hawks rarely are ready for the heat Miami brings
to its games. They've lost seven of their last nine to Pat Riley's
team, with Mutombo consistently out-muscled by his former
Georgetown teammate, Alonzo Mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens says Mutombo will fare better this time. Against
Cleveland, Mutombo had only eight rebounds and five points.
``Except for that, Deek's been focused every night. ,'' Wilkens
said. ``You have to have that when you play Miami. You have to be
ready for their double teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Tacitly conceding that he has been a relatively easy mark for
fellow Hoya alums Mourning and Patrick Ewing, Mutombo has taken a
harder line with them that precludes socializing.
</P>
<P>
   He refused Ewing's invitation to dinner last Tuesday when the
Knicks came to town and said he would not visit with Mourning
before tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all summer to get together and talk,'' Mutombo said.
``But this is business. Patrick and 'Zo are my friends, but they
are also my opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   With only a game in New York remaining on its schedule after
tonight, Miami needs one victory to clinch home-court advantage
through all three rounds of the Eastern Conference playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In a small sidelight to the game, the Hawks have replaced Miami
as the stingiest team in the NBA. The Hawks allow 83 points a game,
and the Heat's average climbed to 83.8 after stunning losses to
Boston and Chicago and Sunday's 100-93 victory over Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   It was no coincidence that the Heat's average went up when
Mourning missed both losses. After suffering a slight fracture of
his right eye orbit, he came back Sunday with 19 points, 12
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks have been hit hard by a rash of minor eye injuries. Ty
Corbin will not play tonight after suffering a fracture of his left
eye socket Friday. Alan Henderson had his left eye raked Sunday
night. Squinting after the game, he complained of blurred vision.
It took two days for Steve Smith's right eye to return to normal
after Larry Johnson poked him last week.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson wondered Sunday if he should return to Atlanta for
medical attention, but Mutombo would not hear of it. ``You're
coming with us,'' he told the younger player. ``We need you with
us. They have doctors in Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson did go home. He and Corbin were examined Monday
morning, and Henderson was declared out until Wednesday. Corbin,
wearing goggles, also should be available Wednesday.

 &HT;    Soccer supporters want stadium built
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After waiting too late to try save an old stadium, a
group of Atlanta soccer leaders figured they needed a better way to
fight for their sport in a city that didn't seem to care. The
fledging Save Our Stadium organization routinely blasted political
and business leaders who did nothing to change the fate of
Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium; the soccer group envisioned the
stadium as a soccer venue after the Braves baseball club moved out.
</P>
<P>
   But when the wrecking ball finally came down in the summer of
1997, it galvanized Save Our Stadium members to keep plugging away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned a lesson the hard way,'' said Robert Tracey, a
former board member of the group. ``It just made us more
tenacious.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of taking on the power structure, the soccer diehards
joined a growing cadre of Atlanta business figures, and unveiled
plans Monday for a $100 million ``Atlanta Soccer Village,'' billed
as the first of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
   With the aim of helping make Atlanta the ``sports capital of the
world,'' the proposed complex would serve as a magnet to lure a
Major League Soccer franchise, as well as host of international
soccer matches, youth and adult amateur tournaments and other
sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   Making the announcement at the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce
were former Atlanta Chiefs coach and North American Soccer League
commissioner Phil Woosnam and veteran public-relations executive
Amanda Brown-Olmstead, the project's manager. The complex would be
built under the auspices of the Georgia State Soccer Association,
but it also would have significant business backing for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what happens when you bring professionalism to our
passion for soccer,'' said Rex Hardaway, chairman of the soccer
association's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   But the two most critical details of the proposal _ a 200-acre
site and financing _ are yet to be announced.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Soccer Village Management Corporation is considering
five sites, and soon will make public presentations in those
communities. Project officials have declined to identify specific
property locations, but they said they hope to make a site decision
by the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the proposal, a 25,000-seat stadium,
expandable to 40,000, would be only the second soccer-specific
stadium in the United States. On May 15, Atlanta Soccer Village
officials will be in Columbus, Ohio, where the MLS Crew franchise
will christen a 22,500-seat facility built by team investor Lamar
Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   MLS sent a representative to Atlanta for Monday's announcement,
and U.S. Soccer Federation secretary general Hank Steinbrecher flew
in for the occasion. ``When the GSSA says it's a great project, we
know it's going to be a great project,'' Steinbrecher said.
Brown-Olmstead said project funding would come from a variety of
sources, almost all of them private. A stadium would be the first
of three steps required to earn MLS consideration for its 2003
expansion phase. The city must line up potential franchise
investors and demonstrate support for the resuscitated A-League
Atlanta Silverbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for real, folks,'' Hardaway said, ``and we're going to
make it happen.''

SAVING LIVES IN THE AIR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 9) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A talented young colleague of mine died suddenly in her kitchen
a few years ago despite everything her husband and an emergency
squad could do. I found the funeral particularly difficult because
a medical expert had told me she need not have died; that a heart
in cardiac arrest in an otherwise healthy person could be restarted
with almost no damage provided it is done quickly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Defibrillators, which can do the job in time, are a familiar
prop on hospital television dramas, where they are wheeled
on-screen _ ponderous and complex machines. But defibrillators are
also now available as automated battery-driven devices that cost
about $3,000 and are the size and weight of a desk dictionary.
Amusement parks have them. Casino hotels in Las Vegas have them.
Airports have them. EMS has them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And now more airlines are getting them and training their
employees to use them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Without a defibrillator, an airborne plane is among the worst
places to suffer cardiac arrest because effective help is at least
half an hour away, on the ground. But with a defibrillator, the
compact fuselage, where everyone can be kept seated in an
emergency, may be one of the most best places to put a
defibrillator to work. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The key to saving a life in cardiac arrest is speed. When cells
are deprived of blood, they begin to die, and that includes brain
cells. Medical studies show, and the Red Cross and other agencies
teach, that chances of survival decrease 10 percent with every
minute that passes without circulation of blood.
</P>
<P>
   Quick application of cardiopulmonary resuscitation can force
blood out of an inactive heart into the body as a holding action.
But a defibrillator can shock the heart into working again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To reassure myself that I could handle an emergency, I recently
took the Red Cross four-and-a-half-hour class on how to help others
with cardiopulmonary resuscitation, rescue breathing and a
defibrillator.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Deaths occur on airplanes with some regularity. In the six
months between July 1 and Dec. 31 last year, the major United
States airlines reported that 103 passengers had become acutely
sick on board, and that planes were diverted to the nearest airport
to get help 34 times. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of the 103 people stricken, at least 56 died in flight or later
in a hospital. (The outcome of some hospitalization cases was not
known.) Not all the causes were cardiac arrest, of course; there
were cases of asthma and terminal cancer and hemorrhages.
</P>
<P>
   But one case in particular struck me: A 43-year-old man
traveling from Palm Beach, Fla., to Newark, N.J., last summer was
helped by three fellow passengers _ all with some
medical-assistance training _ while the plane was diverted to
Jacksonville, Fla. The passenger was dead by the time the plane
landed.
</P>
<P>
   Under the heading ``defibrillator'' on the reports are four
choices: ``not needed,'' ``shock delivered,'' ``monitor only'' and
``not available.'' This last choice was what was checked off in the
report by the airline, whose identity is not given on the form. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there is the now-famous Michael Tighe, a
Boston public health officer saved at 62 by an American Airlines
flight attendant, an emergency medical technician, a physician, a
nurse and a ``shock delivered'' aboard a plane going from Boston to
Los Angeles and diverted to Denver.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tighe's is not the only life saved on this airline since it
began installing defibrillators in July 1997, according to
American's medical director, Dr. David McKenas. He said that on
eight occasions the devices took readings and were activated to
administer shocks. Of these eight patients, five were revived,
although one died later in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   This was a survival rate of 62 percent, McKenas pointed out, or
50 percent if the hospital death is included in the nonsurvival
column. The survival rate for field rescue work by EMS squads and
the like is 10 percent, because of the delay in getting
defibrillators to patients. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Qantas, the Australian airline, began installing defibrillators
in 1991, and reports it has eight long-term survivors out of at
least 23 people with heart attacks. The most recent success at
Qantas, according to Agnes Huff, a spokeswoman, was at a departure
gate at Chek Lap Kok Airport in Hong Kong on Feb. 1. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After July 1 the office of the federal air surgeon, Dr. Jon L.
Jordan, will have a year's worth of statistics for domestic
airlines. The figures are being collected under a provision of the
Aviation Medical Assistance Act of 1998. Congress wanted the data
for an evaluation of the medical kits now required on United States
planes. The act also provides immunity from lawsuits to good
Samaritans who help in emergencies on airplanes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the study, Jordan said, the FAA, of which he is
the chief medical officer, can decide to propose a rule changing
the medical kit requirements it has established, it can stand pat
or it can turn the matter back to Congress for action. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, airlines are buying portable defibrillators. In
addition to Qantas, Virgin Atlantic and Air Zimbabwe were early
among foreign airlines. Varig of Brazil and Swissair _ and
doubtless other foreign lines _ have them. British Airways has
begun installation and training of its flight attendants and
expects to have all 250 planes equipped within a year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the domestic lines, things have been moving faster lately,
possibly because of the wide publicity given to American's success
in November. Delta says its planes will all have defibrillators by
June. US Airways has the devices on a third of its fleet and
expects to complete the job by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   United will start installation later in the year, its spokesman
says, and will finish by March 2000. Continental is ``still
evaluating them,'' as is Trans World Airways, whose spokesman, Jim
Brown, said that a decision would be made after the FAA study was
complete. Northwest said it was planning defibrillators for its
fleet although a date has not been fixed.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Princess Cruises, based in Los Angeles and Seattle, announced in
March that its fleet of 10 vessels was getting 65 portable
defibrillators to augment the hospital models in its infirmaries.
Disney also has five ``strategically located'' portable
defibrillators aboard its Magic, along with two in the clinic.
Kiersten Murane, a spokeswoman, says the Wonder will be identically
equipped when she goes into service Aug. 15. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The big advantage of the portable defibrillator, which experts
are now calling an AED, for automatic external defibrillator, is
that it leaves virtually no space for mishandling by a nonmedical
person. I took my training on the Heartstream by Hewlett-Packard of
Seattle, but the Lifepak 500, made by Medtronic Physio-Control in
Redmond, Wash., has the same safeguards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the Red Cross class, which was organized for seven of the
agency's own employees on Amsterdam Avenue in New York, mock-ups of
the Heartstream were used. They are identical to the real thing,
right down to the recorded voice that tells the operator what is
going on, but they do not administer a shock. The dummies used for
CPR training are also used for defibrillator training: they are
part of the same sequence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our instructor, Deanna Ambroso, covered procedures in detail,
including how to take off rubber gloves _ needed for rescue
breathing _ without contaminating your hands. She warned about not
using the device on a wet or metallic surface. The class went
through a sequence of possibilities, from someone's choking through
someone's being unconscious, not breathing and having no pulse. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The classroom defibrillators could be programmed for various
scripts, including misapplication of the plastic pads to the
patient. When the cords, plugs and plastic pads are unfolded for
use, there is a diagram on each pad showing where it is to be
applied to the patient.
</P>
<P>
   The sticky side goes onto the skin without any jelly or stickum.
The real kit, which I examined in The New York Times' medical
department, has razors to shave chest hair, which may keep the pads
from adhering. The plug on the cord is stuck into the the machine
and it is turned on. The voice says it is monitoring the heart and
no one should touch the patient. It may then say that a shock
should be administered and everyone is to stand back. Administering
the shock involves pressing a button. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All this is a good deal less difficult than administering CPR,
which is probably going to be necessary in an emergency while
someone gets the defibrillator, or calls for help. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross is starting pilot programs in 17 cities for
companies that want to own defibrillators and train their
employees: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Detroit,
Durham, N.C., Farmington, Conn., Honolulu, Houston, Kansas City,
Mo., Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Seattle and St.
Louis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Local Red Cross chapters can provide information about classes.
For corporations in New York, the Greater New York Red Cross number
is (212) 875-2034. The American Heart Association is also providing
rescue courses that include defibrillator training. Information:
(800) 242-8721.

 &HT;    AT&AMP;T offer accepted by board; Comcast can counter
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AT&AMP;T Corp. edged closer to victory Monday in its bid
to buy MediaOne Group Inc. _ all without firing a shot.
</P>
<P>
   The huge company's offer for MediaOne, originally valued at $62
billion, was accepted over the weekend by the cable provider's
board, which gave rival bidder Comcast until Thursday to top the
AT&AMP;T proposal. And while Comcast has yet to publicly respond to the
deadline, it apparently lost a potential partner who could have
helped pool enough stock and cash to out-bid AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   America Online was reported by CNBC to have dropped out of talks
with Comcast and Microsoft aimed at hammering out a plan to combine
resources in a bidding war against AT&AMP;T. America Online declined
comment.
</P>
<P>
   In March, MediaOne accepted a $52 billion offer from Comcast.
That agreement included a $1.5 billion payment to Comcast if some
other bidder succeeding in purchasing the company.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, Comcast was still considering whether to mount
another bid. Should AOL withdraw, Comcast would be left hoping
Microsoft or another company will help pony up the needed money.
And since AT&AMP;T's offer out-did the original Comcast offer for
MediaOne by about $8 billion, any counter-bid now must be high
enough to at least give AT&AMP;T pause, or else AT&AMP;T will simply up the
ante again.
</P>
<P>
   Many metro Atlanta consumers may be forgiven puzzlement at the
furor over MediaOne. The largest area cable provider with more than
500,000 customers, MediaOne's reputation has been uneven at best.
MediaOne has long maintained that it has worked hard to improve
inadequate customer service, but its image has continued to take a
battering. Earlier this year, the service of a number of MediaOne
cable customers was accidentally cut off during the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But elsewhere, MediaOne's systems are viewed with approval and
even envy. The company has large operations in Boston, Detroit, Los
Angeles, Miami and Minneapolis, but virtually all those MediaOne
systems were bought from Continental Cablevision, which was known
as a top-flight cable company. By contrast, Atlanta operations were
purchased from two companies, GCTV and Wometco. Wometco, which
represented the larger share of customers, had a splotchy service
record.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what makes MediaOne so attractive elsewhere is also being
done in Atlanta. The company has spent hundreds of millions of
dollars upgrading the systemto bring every customer interactive
services including video and television, as well as high-speed
Internet access and telephone service, too.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne has more than 100,000 high-speed customers, who receive
a version of the Internet access service called Road Runner that
was developed with Time Warner, Microsoft, Compaq and Newhouse.
AT&AMP;T has a different cable provided high-speed service, called At
Home.
</P>
<P>
   But what AT&AMP;T really wants is MediaOne's fat pipeline to the
Internet. And it is that broadband pipe that Microsoft wants access
to, as well. AT&AMP;T is willing to buy most of that broadband access _
at least for starters.
</P>
<P>
   A richer deal
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has offered $30.85 a share in cash, plus 95 percent of a
share for each MediaOne share. The various offers on the table have
been valued differently, partly because the stock prices have
fluctuated and partly because some reports do not include the debt
that the buyer would absorb.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being $8 billion higher, the AT&AMP;T offer includes
a cash component and voting stock _ which Comcast had not proposed.
</P>
<P>
   America Online has no cash, but could contribute its stock to
any deal-making. Those shares are currently worth $124 billion, but
have been subject to the roller-coaster of Net stocks. Microsoft,
which has also asked for the information needed to make a bid, can
more easily afford to join the fray. But does it truly have the
will?
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock is worth $403 billion _ more than twice that
of AT&AMP;T's _ and it also has a hefty pile of cash _ $20 billion _
that could sweeten any deal.
</P>
<P>
   Yet strategy may be more crucial to Microsoft than simple
short-term finances. Microsoft wants badly to sell software to
cable companies for high-speed and interactive services that will
be delivered via set-top boxes. Microsoft already has an investment
in Comcast. Teaming up with Comcast in a winning bid would give
Microsoft access to tens of millions of customers.
</P>
<P>
   But if Microsoft wins the battle for MediaOne's set-top boxes it
may risk losing the war by aggravating AT&AMP;T, which became the
nation's second-largest cable company when it purchased
Tele-Communications Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, what if Microsoft sides with Comcast and then loses?
</P>
<P>
   What Microsoft might settle for, is a little bit of both.
Already a part owner of Comcast, Microsoft may be threatening a bid
for MediaOne in order to play for a better deal with AT&AMP;T. AOL too
might prefer to have a lucrative deal with every cable company
rather than even an exclusive pact with one.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other potential partners for Comcast. Former
Microsoft founder Paul Allen, who in Charter Communications has
been putting together his own cable company, is also reportedly
interested.

 &HT;    Air Force base plays key role in Kosovo conflict
 &HT;    By Richard Whitt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARNER ROBINS, Ga. _ Far from the war-torn Balkans, 11,000
Middle Georgians in a mostly civilian force are working overtime to
support the allied war effort in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The huge Warner Robins Air Logistic Center at Robins Air Force
Base is responsible for repairing or replacing about 80 percent of
the electronic equipment and weapons systems on U.S. fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
   Many employees are working 12-hour days, 7 days a week, said Air
Force Major General Richard N. Goddard. Some units are totaling up
to 75 percent more hours than normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gearing to the need. I try to tell our people that we're
in a war. They aren't calling it a war,'' Goddard said.
</P>
<P>
   A steady stream of crates and boxes, some 218,000 pounds in all,
leave the base every day by commercial carrier. Many are marked
with the code numbers ``999'' meaning they are bound for the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 15 warehouses with over 250,000 items here. Everything
from nuts and bolts to F-15 wings,'' said Col. Joe Carter, who
heads the defense distribution depot.
</P>
<P>
   It's Carter's job to make sure that everything necessary leaves
the center on time.
</P>
<P>
   Behind him, are a legion of electronics technicians, airplane
mechanics, metal workers and engineers.
</P>
<P>
   This is Georgia's largest industrial complex.
</P>
<P>
   One of five such centers that support military operations
throughout the world, this center handles all regularly
scheduledmaintenance on the F-15 fighters used in Kosovo. It also
maintains most of the Air Force's air cargo planes, including the
giant C-5A.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining the military's aging fleet is a tricky business,
said Debbie Walker, chief of industrial production.
</P>
<P>
   Many manufacturers and suppliers of equipment when aircraft
first came into production are no longer in business. To keep the
aircraft flying, workers at Warner Robins have to manufacture many
of the parts.
</P>
<P>
   Their biggest challenge, said Goddard, is keeping 30-40 year-old
airplanes flying. The center has ``world class'' industrial and
engineering capabilities, said Goddard.
</P>
<P>
   ``A C-5 might need only one particular part that isn't made any
more. We manufacture it here,'' he said.

BLAIR VISITS KOSOVAR REFUGEES, PROMISES TO DOUBLE AID 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANKOVIC I REFUGEE CAMP, Macedonia _ Prime Minister Tony Blair
of Britain visited this tent city of 30,000 displaced Kosovars on
Monday, promising to double his nation's aid to Macedonia for
handling the refugee crisis to $64 million from $32 million.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's stop at the camp was meant to be symbolic.
Actually, he did not venture very far inside. He, his wife, Cherie,
and selected photographers spent nine minutes in the nearest tent,
No. 230B, with its five residents. Blair sat on a gray blanket,
drank some juice, listened to brief versions of anguished stories
and held one teen-ager's hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him it is very hot in this camp, and we can't stand the
heat,'' said Susana Nazifi, 22, whose tent may well have been
selected for her fluent English as well as its proximity to a back
gate. ``I saw in Tony's eyes that he felt sorry for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister entered Stankovic I near a makeshift swimming
hole. In the searing heat, it has become a liquid magnet for
hundreds for children. Most refugees left Kosovo in heavy flannels
to endure a trek through the mountains. One of youth's privileges
is the shedding of apparel, and many young boys now wander around
in their underpants.
</P>
<P>
   These frolicking children gave Blair a cheerful greeting. Few of
them knew who he was, but the camp authorities had coached them to
provide a rousing chant: ``Tony! Tony!''
</P>
<P>
   Blair's helicopter had circled for several minutes before
landing. This aerial view gives a good sense of Stankovic's teeming
sprawl, but it provides little feeling for the hardships of such an
impromptu metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   In farewell remarks to reporters, Blair sounded steadfast in the
campaign against Yugoslavia and President Slobodan Milosevic.
``This is not a battle for NATO,'' he said. ``This is not a battle
for territory. It is a battle for humanity. It is a just cause.''
</P>
<P>
   With Stankovic so huge _ and with Blair arriving in a rear
corner _ few refugees were even aware of his presence. This may
have been just as well. ``I don't know much about Tony Blair except
that he is an American,'' said Florie Kelmendi, 20.
</P>
<P>
   Only a small percentage of the refugees knew Blair's job title,
though those who did were complimentary. President Clinton may be
seen as the pilot of NATO's air campaign, but the more hawkish
prime minister is regarded as the bombardier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blair is a man of strength,'' Nexhat Rrahmani said, curling
his fingers into a fist.
</P>
<P>
   But even if more refugees had known the prime minister was
there, any visit of a politician would be of less import than the
daily arrival of the new busloads. These draw truly big crowds as
people stand on tiptoes in hopes of seeing loved ones through the
windows.
</P>
<P>
   At Stankovic, the vital news of each day regards who is coming
in and who is getting out. Refugees study lists of the fortunate
few who have been selected to go to another country.
</P>
<P>
   Some refugees are ready to go anywhere. ``I have asked to go to
either Israel or New Zealand,'' said Asllan Statovci, 32. ``Both
are good, though maybe New Zealand is better. I am told that in
Israel there is only two hours of light and the rest of the day is
darkness.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, 11,000 more refugees entered Macedonia. The nine camps
are overflowing, and new arrivals sleep on blue plastic sheets
under the stars. The government is unhappy. They want other nations
to share more of the burden, and undoubtedly Blair heard more
complaints in official meetings with them than in his friendly chat
in Tent 230B.

<P>
   Four days ago, the government opened a new camp near the city of
Cegrane, and it already has 17,000 occupants. Richard Gere, the
actor, visited there on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Hatixhe Ajeti, 54, saw him go by. It was her first day at the
camp, and she was sitting on the ground, fanning herself with a
handkerchief. She had gone to the medical clinic, complaining of
palpitations. They gave her an injection, but now she could not
find her way back to her tent. Every row looked the same. The tents
had yet to be numbered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suffer from very bad tension,'' she said evenly. ``At my
age, it is not good to be lost.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Ajeti saw the actor approaching with an entourage of
cameramen, she at first thought it might be a search party. She had
been sitting there for quite some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is this coming?'' she asked and then frowned at the
answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, a famous actor,'' she said. ``Too bad. What I need is a
doctor.''

   RINAS AIR FIELD, Albania _ Fear is part of preparing for war.
</P>
<P>
   It's something most of the of the 5,000 American combat troops
here won't talk about -- least of all with us ``pukes'' from the
media.
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sgt. Kevin Boldin of the 1st Armored Division(CQ) is an
exception. At 29, Boldin has been there and done it. So he doesn't
mind opening up about what war anxiety is like when you are young.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers what it feels like in the pit of your stomach when
you have to sneak over a hostile border at night and clear
anti-tank mines while you're wearing a chemical weapons suit.
</P>
<P>
   That's what he did when he was a 20-year-old recent graduate of
Carver High School in Columbus, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   During the Gulf War, Boldin was then one of the farthest forward
troops. He was a combat engineer of the 1st Infantry Division.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's 29 and has a wife and two kids back at his base in
Baumholder, Germany. He's getting ready for his second war, maybe
the world's last war of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Boldin spoke to Cox Newspapers correspondent Joseph Albright as
the tall, imposing soldier stood next to the big armored car with
gun turrets that he commands. It's called a Bradley Fighting
Vehicle. It's the battlefield taxi that carries seven infantrymen
as they dash forward just behind the first wave of tanks.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Boldin's Bradley is assigned to guard this runway that
sits 64 miles from the border of Yugoslavia's embattled Kosovo
province. If a ground war starts, he could well be ordered forward
as part of a NATO effort to breach Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's front lines. He and his fellow soldiers haven't been
told what's going to happen, but they wouldn't be surprised if it's
ground combat.
</P>
<P>
   We talked about what it's like in your gut before a battle.
</P>
<P>
   Boldin was next to a vast field of rutted and slowing drying mud
a foot deep. The generals call this place ``Hawkbase.'' That's the
new name of the encampment by the runway for the Apache helicopter
gunships and their 5,000 U.S. Army support troops.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Boldin had to say:
</P>
<P>
   Q: So where did you end up in the Gulf War
</P>
<P>
   A: We went into Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So now you are here for another one.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, here for another one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So how does it feel like?
</P>
<P>
   A: Back then, I was, you know, a little scared. I am not scared
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Not even a little bit?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not even a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why?
</P>
<P>
   A: Because it's my job.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You know how to do it . . .
</P>
<P>
   A: I know how to do it now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So back then in the Gulf, your job was clearing roads and
stuff like
</P>
<P>
   that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, and mine fields.
</P>
<P>
   Q: This was on the first night of the ground war?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, we had to clear 'em. It was called the Big Breach.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After that, nothing scares you?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, nothing scares me. I don't think I'm supposed to be here.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did it come close then?
</P>
<P>
   A: Didn't come close. I guess I'm blessed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what is different about this deployment?
</P>
<P>
   A: Now, I got the mud. I liked the sand better. You don't have
to worry about your books getting all muddy, and you got to scrape
them off at night and stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It must have been tough at the beginning here with all the
mud?
</P>
<P>
   A: You know, you get used to it. It's getting better now,
everything is all right now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the mood of the troops? What are people thinking?
</P>
<P>
   A: Hmm, well. You know, you got younger soldiers, they're kind
of, you know, they're kind of scared. You know it's normal, it's
natural.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So now they're the ones looking up to you?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, they're the ones looking up to me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: They're asking what was it like in the Gulf War?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh yeah.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you tell em?
</P>
<P>
   A: I say, once I was in your shoes. And you know, I know where
you're coming from. They're going to be OK.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the Gulf War, there were still some people around from
Vietnam?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh yeah. A lot of 'em. But there is nobody from Vietnam now.
They've all retired.

TURKEY SCANDALIZED BY WOMAN'S WEARING OF SCARF IN PARLIAMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Last week, almost no one in Turkey had heard
of Merve Kavakci. Now, she stands accused of nothing less than
trying to destroy the nation, and Turks are talking of little else.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit has begun assembling a new
government, but few seem to care. Even the figure of Abdullah
Ocalan, the captured Kurdish revolutionary, who is intensely hated,
has suddenly faded from the public consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Front pages of Monday's newspapers were dominated by large
photos of Ms. Kavakci on the floor of Parliament, where her
appearance with a head scarf on Sunday sparked pandemonium.
Television stations endlessly rebroadcast tape showing members of
Parliament angrily waving their arms and shouting insults at her.
</P>
<P>
   The country's chief prosecutor, Vural Savas, announced that he
had opened a criminal investigation. He may charge her with
violating a law that punishes anyone who ``openly incites people to
enmity and hatred by pointing to differences of class, race,
religion or creed.''
</P>
<P>
   In some Muslim countries, laws or social pressures force women
to cover their heads. Here the reverse is true. Wearing the scarf
in public universities, courtrooms and especially in Parliament is
strictly taboo.
</P>
<P>
   Secularism is one of the pillars of the Turkish Republic.
Powerful military and civilian leaders believe that the head scarf
is being used as a symbol by fundamentalists whose ultimate goal is
to pull Turkey away from the modern world and back toward religious
obscurantism.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, no woman who wore a head scarf had ever been
elected to the Turkish Parliament. Two were elected in April. One
appeared at the inaugural session on Sunday without her scarf, to
the vigorous applause of her colleagues. The other, Ms. Kavakci,
who is a member of the religious-oriented Virtue Party, refused to
remove hers.
</P>
<P>
   As tension rose in the parliamentary chamber, a 45-minute recess
was declared, and when members returned, Ms. Kavakci was absent. As
a result, she did not take her oath of office. She may soon be
stripped of her seat under a rule that allows the expulsion of
members who miss five consecutive sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is an agent provocateur,'' President Suleyman Demirel
asserted in a television interview. ``What she has done is
separatism.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kavakci, 31, appeared before journalists Monday to read a
statement. ``Know this,'' she declared. ``I will defend to the end
this office that the people have given me, in a manner suited to a
woman from the Virtue Party, with this appearance and within the
law. I cover my head in accordance with my religious beliefs. It is
a personal choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kavakci may have set the stage for a new round of
confrontation between secularists and those who favor a greater
role for religion in Turkish life. The Virtue Party is the
successor to the Welfare Party, which was banned last year on the
grounds that it was anti-secular. A case in which the government
seeks to ban Virtue is now pending.
</P>
<P>
   Virtue leaders have been trying to portray their party as
different from Welfare, asserting that it is ready to work within
the secular system. That argument now becomes more difficult to
make.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders point out, however, that there is no explicit ban
on the head scarf in Parliament. ``We don't want to confront the
state, which is our state,'' said a senior Virtue leader, Abdullah
Gul. ``But if the state doesn't accept you, you have to struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's confrontation might someday be the subject of a tale
called ``Necmettin Erbakan's Revenge.'' Erbakan is the guiding
figure in the Islamic political movement. He became prime minister
in 1996, but a year later was forced to resign, under intense
pressure from secularist military officers. Later his party was
outlawed, and he was banned from politics for five years.
</P>
<P>
   He has reportedly been running Virtue from behind the scenes,
though, and placing Ms. Kavakci on its list of candidates was
reportedly his idea. Thus he planted a time bomb in the heart of
the political establishment. It exploded on Sunday.

JUSTICES TO DECIDE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE FLEEING CRIME AREA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide if the
Constitution permits police patrolling in high-crime neighborhoods
to stop and frisk people solely because they run upon seeing the
officers.
</P>
<P>
   The case, from a crime-infested area of Chicago, pits the
interests of law enforcement against the Fourth Amendment right of
people to be free from unreasonable searches. The Illinois Supreme
Court, in a ruling against the police, said suspect Sam Wardlow's
decision to scamper from Chicago officers did not give them
sufficient reason to suspect him of having committed a crime or to
frisk him, a body search that uncovered a firearm.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois Attorney General James Ryan successfully urged the U.S.
Supreme Court to review the Illinois high court's decision, which
had overturned Wardlow's gun-possession conviction. Ryan, defending
the controversial chase and search of Wardlow, told the justices
that police in dangerous neighborhoods nationwide would be
hamstrung in their ability to fight crime if they were prohibited
from chasing people who bolt at the sight of officers.
</P>
<P>
   But Rita Fry, the chief Cook County, Ill., public defender
representing Wardlow, countered that the rights of innocent people
would be jeopardized if police were allowed to search them simply
because they ran away. But the justices rejected Fry's request that
they simply let the Illinois Supreme Court's decision stand.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to hear the case, Illinois
vs. Wardlow, later this year or in early 2000 and to render their
decision by July 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The case arose four years ago when Chicago police Officer
Timothy Nolan and seven of his colleagues were patrolling an area
of the city known for narcotics traffic. Wardlow saw the officers
and took off running.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan gave chase in his car, catching up with Wardlow after
several blocks. When Nolan approached the suspect and patted him
down to ensure Wardlow was not armed, the officer found a loaded
Colt. .38-caliber handgun and arrested him.
</P>
<P>
   At trial, Wardlow argued that Nolan's search was unreasonable
because the officer had no right to suspect him of a crime just
because he ran away. But the trial judge rejected that argument,
ruling that ``there's reasons to think there's a problem'' when
somebody runs upon seeing a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Wardlow was found guilty of unlawful use of a weapon by a felon
and was sentenced to two years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   But the Illinois Supreme Court overturned the conviction, ruling
that Nolan had no right to suspect Wardlow of committing a crime
simply because he ran. Instead, the officer must be ``able to point
to specific facts corroborating the inference of guilt gleaned from
defendant's flight,'' the Illinois high court said.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, the state attorney general, told the U.S. Supreme Court
that the Illinois decision should not stand and police should be
allowed to reach the obvious conclusion that a person fleeing them
probably did something illegal . ``This (Illinois ruling) puts the
officers in the unenviable position of having to shrug their
shoulders and helplessly stand watching while such persons
escape,'' Ryan wrote in his legal brief successfully urging the
court to hear the state's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But Fry praised the Illinois Supreme Court for protecting the
rights of innocent people in high-crime neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because both flight and presence in a high-crime area are
consistent with innocent behavior, the Illinois Supreme Court
properly found that additional suspicious circumstances were
required to justify officer Nolan's stop of Wardlow,'' Fry wrote in
her unsuccessful brief to the justices.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHDOD, Israel _ The middle-aged man spoke the halting, simple
Hebrew of a new immigrant, and with a habitual wariness learned
back in Moscow, he would identify himself only by his first name.
</P>
<P>
   But Alexander, a factory worker who came to Israel from Russia
two years ago, could not have been clearer about his choice for
prime minister in the Israeli election on May 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only Netanyahu,'' he said as he strolled with his mother
through an immigrant neighborhood in this southern coastal city.
``I'm against giving up territory to the Arabs, because we'll end
up with no country. The Arabs want it all. You can't make peace
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Alexander asserted, Ehud Barak, the Labor Party
candidate, who is the main opponent of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, is a socialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from Russia, and I know what socialism is,'' he said. ``We
don't want socialism here.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter that Labor has moved away from the socialist vision of
its early leaders, or that Barak wants to keep chunks of West Bank
territory in a final peace deal with the Palestinians. Many of the
780,000 immigrants who have come to Israel in the last decade from
the former Soviet Union favor Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 percent of the Russian immigrant votes were for him in
the last national election in 1996, post-election surveys
indicated, and current polls show similar levels of support.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in an authoritarian state with vast territories, many of
the Russian-speaking immigrants instinctively prefer Netanyahu's
image of a strong leader who stands tough on ceding land to the
Arabs. A collective memory of Soviet anti-Jewish repression and
resurgent anti-Semitism in Russia have contributed to a surge of
Israeli nationalism among the newcomers that tilts many of them to
the right.
</P>
<P>
   Yet because they lack the entrenched political identities of
veteran Israelis, the same immigrants are seen by the candidates as
the most susceptible to persuasion, forming a critical voting bloc
that might be swayed more easily than other groups.
</P>
<P>
   With about 580,000 eligible voters, about one-seventh of the
Israeli electorate, the Russian-speaking immigrants are being
vigorously courted by both front-runners in the race for prime
minister. Both have appealed to Russian voters in television ads,
using Russian subtitles to get their messages across.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the largest community whose attitude is still
changeable,'' said Ephraim Sneh, a Labor lawmaker who is in charge
of Barak's campaign among the Russian immigrants. He cited recent
opinion polls indicating that a quarter of the Russians were
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   With an eye to their votes, Netanyahu and his most powerful
political ally, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, have visited Moscow
in recent weeks, meeting Russian leaders and granting interviews to
Russian television stations that are heavily watched by immigrants
on cable broadcasts back in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The visits were billed as strictly diplomatic, focused on
curbing reported leaks of Russian nuclear and missile technology to
Iran and arms sales to Syria. But they seem to have had an impact
on the immigrants, many of whom still feel linked to their native
land.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll published by Israel's most widely circulated
newspaper, Yediot Ahronot, 26 percent of the immigrants surveyed
said they would be more inclined to vote for Netanyahu if he worked
to improve Israel's ties with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting an uphill battle in largely hostile territory, Barak
has struck back with overtures of his own, using a Russian-language
campaign jingle and a personal message to immigrant voters in his
television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   He has addressed the uneasiness of the largely secular
immigrants with Israel's Orthodox rabbinic establishment, which has
questioned the Judaism of many new arrivals and set tough standards
for the conversion of those it deems not Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has served notice that in his Cabinet the interior
minister, whose department registers immigrants as Jews and grants
them citizenship, will not come from Shas, the Sephardic
ultra-Orthodox party.
</P>
<P>
   Shas has controlled the powerful Interior Ministry for more than
a decade as a crucial partner in a series of governing coalitions.
But the ministry's treatment of immigrants not recognized as Jews,
some of whom it has deported, has angered the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said the ministry should be run by an immigrant, the
main campaign demand of Yisrael B'Aliya, the Russian immigrant
party headed by Natan Sharansky.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings with Russian voters, Sneh argues that Barak's peace
policies will improve the Israeli economy while Netanyahu's hard
line will lead to deepening diplomatic stalemate and economic
recession that will cost immigrants their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is depicted as slavishly bowing to the whims of his
ultra-Orthodox allies, while Barak is described as a cultured
candidate whose world view is closer to that of the immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the immigrants' lack of familiarity with Barak works against
him, along with their perception that he lacks Netanyahu's ability
to drive a hard bargain while resisting diplomatic pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Barak is strong enough to stand up to the
Americans, or strong enough to negotiate with the Palestinians and
the Syrians,'' said Mark Livshitz, an engineer living in Ashdod who
emigrated eight years ago from Ukraine. ``Netanyahu is stronger.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The imprint of anti-Jewish repression in the Soviet Union and
grass-roots anti-Semitism in present-day Russia has led many
immigrants to conclude that only a tough stand will insure Israel's
survival. So they admire Netanyahu's defiance of American
diplomatic pressure to give ground in negotiations with the
Palestinians and consider territorial concessions a dangerous
gamble with national security.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want a strong leader,'' said Lev Melamed, deputy editor
in chief of Vesty, the most widely circulated Russian-language
newspaper in Israel. ``Having lived in a country that was a
superpower, they take the imperialistic view that you don't cede
land. Peace should be made from a position of strength, and if you
give up land you're showing weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Roman Bronfman, a Parliament member from Yisrael B'Aliya, said
the newcomers were products of their Soviet upbringing. ``They
carry the conceptual baggage of a totalitarian regime,'' he said,
``and Netanyahu represents a more totalitarian approach, with his

   Ron Dermer, a political strategist for Yisrael B'Aliya, said
opinion polls he had conducted indicated that seven out of 10
Russian immigrant voters would choose Netanyahu.

<P>
   ``Your model of leadership depends on what country you're
from,'' Dermer said. ``The immigrants haven't lived with the
Arab-Israeli struggle long enough to get tired of it. There's no
fatigue factor, so they're going to take a harder line. When they
see terrorism they want a harsh response.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Q. I was unable to attend a management meeting
that was run by our regional vice president. I learned afterward
that one of the other managers criticized my work, my attitude and
the way my department is performing. His comments were inaccurate
and hurtful. I cannot let this go, but I am not sure if I should go
directly to the vice president or to this manager first. C.G.
</P>
<P>
   A. It is unfortunate that you have to deal with either of these
individuals. You have a fellow manager who had no qualms about
tearing into you when you were not present and a regional vice
president who let a meeting deteriorate to the point that one
participant attacked another who was not even there.
</P>
<P>
   Although you need to talk to the regional vice president, you
should meet first with the attacking manager. Use a questioning
mode and indicate that you heard he said some negative things about
you, and you were wondering what happened.
</P>
<P>
   He may go in any number of directions, including ignorance,
denial, defensiveness or even an apology. Listen carefully to what
he says, as this will play a key role in determining what you will
say to the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Use the questioning mode when you meet with the vice president,
and be prepared to support yourself with specific performance data.
Ultimately, the three of you will need to clear the air. It will
also be important for the rest of the managers to be given the
facts, and that's a meeting you should not miss.
</P>
<P>
   Q. There is a new position being created in the insurance agency
where I work, and I am the most qualified person to get it. The
problem is that the owner's daughter wants it. If I don't get it, I
will quit. Is this worth mentioning, or should I just let
management make their decision and go from there? D.F.
</P>
<P>
   A. If you approach management of this insurance agency and
threaten to quit, you will be insuring the promotion of the owner's
daughter. Topsiders do not respond well to threats, and voicing one
could indicate to management that you are not ready for a
promotion.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean that you should sit in the wings and say
nothing. You should meet with your manager and be sure that he or
she knows that you are highly interested in, and qualified for, the
new position. Make sure that your manager has a clear understanding
of your skills, expertise, accomplishments and the way in which
your background is a solid match for the position.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to be promoted, you need to do some self-promotion
beforehand. At the same time, if you do not receive the promotion,
it may well be a sign that this family business is putting more
emphasis on family than business.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than automatically quitting, you should express your
concern to your manager and ask for his or her thoughts on the
steps you should be taking in order to increase your likelihood of
being promoted in the future. The response should let you know if
the best policy with this insurance agency is for you to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am the manager of the business office, and for some reason,
there has been a rash of accidents lately. This is not a dangerous
place, but people are tripping, spilling things and cutting
themselves far too often. What do you suggest? H.S.
</P>
<P>
   A. Accidents in your office have increased for ``some reason,''
and you need to find out what it is. With a change in the rate of
accidents, one key question is to ask what else has changed?
Accidents at work are often linked to stress, and they can be
related to any number of work-related factors, including
supervisory style, assignments, working conditions, substance abuse
and much more. On a Freudian level, could there be anything going
on that may be unconsciously causing the employees to try to
disrupt the department?
</P>
<P>
   Carefully review each accident and interview all of the
employees who have been involved in them. You can meet with the
employees individually and in groups not only to discuss the
accidents, but also to develop some strategies to help make the
workplace safer.
</P>
<P>
   Companies with the lowest accident rates tend to have highly
visible and ongoing programs that encourage the employees to work
safely. This is generally accomplished through a combination of
meetings, informal discussions, committees, newsletters and
incentives, all of which help to keep safety on the employees'
minds.
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident that companies with the best safety records
emphasize safety constantly and place it high on the list of
factors that they use to evaluate managerial effectiveness.

 &HT;    Possible Jefferson decendent gives blood for new test
 &HT;    By John Keilman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ For generations, descendents of Thomas Woodson, a
presumed slave of Thomas Jefferson, have claimed they are the flesh
and blood of the nation's third president.
</P>
<P>
   While genetic tests administered last year failed to link the
family with Jefferson, the scientist who did the research is trying
again _ this time with the help of a Trotwood, Ohio man.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Woodson, a former Jefferson Twp. police chief and the
great-great-great-grandson of the man whose name he shares, gave a
blood sample Monday to Dr. Eugene Foster. He is the retired
Charlottesville, Va., professor who last year used DNA samples to
connect Jefferson's family with descendents of Sally Hemings, the
president's slave.
</P>
<P>
   The research thus far has linked relatives of one of Sally's
known sons with descendents of the president's uncle (Thomas
Jefferson himself has no male descendents to test). Though many
believe the genetic match exists because Thomas Jefferson
impregnated Sally Hemings, others say the evidence suggests only
that some Jefferson _ not necessarily Thomas _ was the father.
</P>
<P>
   But if Woodson's DNA is a match _ and it likely will take months
to get the results _ Foster says it will be nearly iron-clad proof
that the author of the Declaration of Independence had at least one
child with his slave.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no story of how Thomas Woodson could have been
fathered by some other Jefferson,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Woodson is not mentioned in Monticello records, but
family history claims he was born to Sally Hemings in 1790, shortly
after she returned from a stay in Paris with Thomas Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   No other male Jeffersons were in France when Thomas would have
been conceived, Foster said.
</P>
<P>
   The family says Thomas was sent to live at the Woodson
plantation after Jefferson was publicly charged with being the
boy's father. He went on to take the name Woodson, and in the early
19th century, he left Virginia for Ohio. He settled near
Chillicothe, and his family rose in prominence: In 1863, it helped
put up some of the money the African Methodist Episcopal Church
used to purchase Wilberforce University.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodson family has hundreds of members across the country,
many in Ohio. Its genealogy is well-documented and its claim to the
Jefferson legacy long-standing. However, when Foster did his
genetic tests last year, no members of the Woodson family matched
the Jefferson chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   But Foster did not exhaust the Woodson family tree. The
patriarch had six sons, and the doctor tested descendents of just
two _ Lewis and James. The lineage of Woodson's son, William, which
includes Trotwood's Thomas Woodson, was not examined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it was so much of a surprise to everyone that (the
relatives of) Eston Hemings matched and that the Woodsons, so far,
have not, that I thought it would be worthwhile to get a sample
from a third line,'' Foster said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that three outcomes are possible: Thomas Woodson's DNA
matches that of other Woodsons already tested; it matches
Jefferson's family; or it matches neither.
</P>
<P>
   The story that Thomas was related to Jefferson has always been
entwined in the family fabric, and the contemporary Thomas Woodson,
who is 66, heard so much about the president as a child that he
grew weary of the tale. It was not until later in life that he took
an interest in the family tree.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when Foster asked him to participate in the original
study last year, he consulted with his brothers and declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I got to thinking and discussing with my wife, and I
figured: Why not?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A crew filming a documentary about Jefferson's genetic legacy
came along Monday to interview Woodson. The film, slated for the
PBS program ``Frontline,'' is supposed to air next year.
</P>
<P>
   Foster said the failure to match other Woodsons to the Jefferson
family suggests this experiment will be a long shot. But if the
test is negative, it still won't annul generations of family lore
in Woodson's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could it disprove anything?'' Woodson said. ``They'd have
to exhume Thomas Jefferson's body to make sure.''

 &HT;    Woman goes on trial for attempted murder of newborn
 &HT;    By Ken McCall
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARREN CO., Ohio _ Deborah Mackey buried her face in her hands
Monday morning and cried quietly as she listened to her
tape-recorded attempts at explaining why she gave birth in a
Franklin factory bathroom last December and then left her newborn
baby in a trash can.
</P>
<P>
   The recorded police interrogation provided the most dramatic
moments in the first day of Mackey's trial on charges of attempted
murder and child endangering. The 38-year-old Carlisle native has
pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity and waived her right to a
jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what came over me,'' Mackey told Franklin Police
Det. Rick Thacker from her hospital bed, just four hours after she
gave birth. ``I was scared and something just happened that I did
such a horrible thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackey broke down crying on the tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe I did it,'' she said, sobbing. ``I can't
believe it. I There's no excuse for what I did. I know it was
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting behind Mackey, more than a dozen of her family members
fought back tears as they listened to the tape in Warren County
Common Pleas Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be punished. I know that,'' Mackey said during
the interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel sorry for me. I don't. As I said, what I did was
cold and heartless.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackey told the detective that she never told anyone she was
pregnant, including the father, her live-in boyfriend. She said she
intended to give the baby up for adoption, although she admitted
she had made no plans or contacted any agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted it to have a better life than the one I could give
it,'' she told Thacker. ``But from what I did it's not very
obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   When the detective accused her of leaving her baby in a trash
can ``to die'' and said that was no way to preserve a better life,
Mackey said on the tape, ``I don't know. Something was happening in
my head. Something was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackey's attorney, Don Oda, said in his opening arguments to
Judge P. Daniel Fedders that he would show his client was legally
insane at the time she gave birth. He cited the prosecution's own
psychologist, Bobbie Hopes, who he said would testify Mackey has
``schizotypal personality disorder'' and underwent a transient
psychotic episode when she gave birth. As a result of her
condition, he said, Mackey sometimes cannot relate to people and
``loses touch with reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Police, he predicted, would describe Mackey as ``detached,
unusually calm, quiet'' during the hours after the birth and
abandonment.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Thacker agreed during cross-examination that Mackey
appeared mostly emotionless and expressionless when he interviewed
her in her hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Wendy Ford, who investigates child abuse for Butler
County, said Mackey was emotionally ``very flat'' during several
interviews in days following the birth.
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant County Prosecutor Andy Sievers promised in his
opening remarks that evidence would show Mackey knew full well what
she was doing when she repeatedly refused offers of assistance in
the bathroom of Ample Industries, claiming that blood on the floor
was the result of unexpected menstruation.
</P>
<P>
   Her attempts to clean up and hide evidence of the birth and her
clear recollection of events, Sievers asserted, would show that
Mackey was legally sane.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, her abandonment of Holly Ann in the cold
bathroom harmed her and would have killed her if she had not been
discovered by a cleaning lady.
</P>
<P>
   He referred to hospital reports from the day of her birth that
found Holly Ann had severe hypothermia, frostbite on her left hand
and feet, and respiratory distress syndrome _ all caused by her
abandonment in the trash can.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case of abandonment and selfishness,'' he said.
``She clearly attempted to kill that baby.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense was scheduled to begin this morning at 9 a.m.

 &HT;    CONGRESS MEMBERS SAW 'MISERY' IN REFUGEE CAMPS
 &HT;    By SCOTT MONTGOMERY
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After slogging through a mucky tent compound in
Macedonia last weekend, a group of House members returned to say
they were awestruck by the scale of the human suffering triggered
by the Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they expressed fear at the prospect of ethnic Albanian
refugees still living in tents when winter comes, the lawmakers
said they were pleased by the optimism America's strained military
holds for fulfilling its mission of driving Serb forces from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation, led by Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas,
returned Sunday night after visiting the refugee camp, two air
bases and NATO headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, a veteran of refugee camp visits around
the world, said conditions at the crowded camp in Skpoje,
Macedonia, were bad but orderly. He said the United States must
plan to spend more on humanitarian relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went because a million people are in misery,'' Hall said.
``A lot of people were talking about the winter, but they better
worry about the summer. It could be a major health problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said doctors at the site have begun seeing cases of
measles, and with seasonal temperatures rising, the camps could be
ideal places for waves of infectious disease such as cholera and
dysentery.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he'll offer an amendment to the $12.9 billion
emergency spending bill now working its way through the House so
more is spent on immediate relief efforts. In the bill, $195
million is budgeted directly for refugee assistance, though
additional money will go to border countries such as Macedonia to
help offset what they've spent so far.
</P>
<P>
   Hall believes some of the economic assistance, such as the
rebuilding of infrastructure, can wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's important,'' Hall said, ``but compared to a million
refugees it's not important right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey, who last week voted against a resolution supporting the
air campaign, seemed moved by the sights and sounds and stories of
the 28,000 people living in the refugee camp. He didn't
specifically endorse Hall's blunt assessment that the spending bill
is inadequate for the humanitarian needs, but said he understood
the perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my understanding that we were fairly generous in the
(emergency spending bill) as it goes now for relief,'' Armey said.
``(But) I don't think anybody, any of us, could come away from
that, seeing that hardship, without feeling a sense that whatever
we're doing we probably need to be doing more.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey also spoke forcefully on the need ``to develop a sense of
urgency'' about the plight of these refugees if they're still
living in tents when winter rolls back around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why in the middle of a beautiful springtime it
hit me so hard, an awareness of what that winter would be like for
people,'' Armey said. ``I say it's imperative, I just don't think
they'll survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Hall and Armey, joined by others from both parties, were
uniformly impressed with the morale of the U.S. military personnel
they met. Armey said delegation members sensed some frustration
over the political limits imposed on the targets the military can
attack, but no one complained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonetheless, there was a broad sense of conviction, belief,
commitment to completing the objectives of this air war,'' Armey
said. ``And I sensed nobody that felt an incapability of doing
that, and the subsequent need for ground troops for the completion
of this.''

SENATE POISED TO KILL PLAN AUTHORIZING GROUND TROOPS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Monday was poised to join the House
in going on record against an expansion of the war in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was scheduled to vote Tuesday on a resolution
authored by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Joseph Biden, D-Del.,
that would allow President Clinton to use ``all necessary force and
other means necessary'' to end Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's killing of ethic Albanians in Kosovo, the southern
province of Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate oppose
the resolution and McCain, its major sponsor, conceded that he it
would be ``badly'' defeated.
</P>
<P>
   In debate leading up to the vote, senators from both parties
criticized the conduct of the air war thus far, claiming that
Clinton has not done a good job of managing the U.S.-led North
Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) bombing campaign in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy is unclear,'' said Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis.,
``I don't believe the administration has articulated the goal of
the air strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., said the administration has ``made
a policy mistake'' by getting involved in the Balkans where, he
said, ``I do not believe we have a viable national security
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The House voted last week to require Clinton to consult Congress
before sending combat land forces into Kosovo. The House also
failed to support a resolution in favor of continuing the air
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the McCain-Biden resolution, Sen. Chuck Hagel,
R-Neb., said Clinton's stated policy of having no plans to use
ground troops was ``irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question the conduct of the war from the beginning
has been questionable but it still leaves us where we are,'' Hagel
said. ``We must face the reality of what do we do now.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain argued that it was the Senate's ``duty'' to send a clear
message about the conflict in the Balkans and he criticized the
House for its contradictory votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is America's war, not Bill Clinton's war,'' McCain said,
referring to the practice of some House Republicans of referring to
the conflict as ``Clinton's war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us in Congress are so distrustful of the president
that we feel obligated to damage the office in order to restrain
the current occupant,'' McCain claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the resolution, including Sen. Barbara Boxer,
D-Calif., said it was ``too broad and too open ended.''
</P>
<P>
   Another opponent, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., criticized the resolution on the grounds that ``the United
States Senate cannot and must not force the president to take
measures that he is unwilling or unprepared to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Several lawmakers suggested the Clinton administration step up
efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict in Yugoslavia
and allow ethic Albanians to return to Kosovo, a province of
Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that we have not stopped the slaughter _ ethnic
cleansing goes on and on and on,'' said Sen. Paul Wellstone,
D-Minn., who suggested a 48-hour pause in the air war to see if a
diplomatic solution can be found.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no consensus in the Congress or in the country with
regard to what we've already done in Kosovo'' said Feingold in
explaining why he thought it was unwise to give Clinton permission
to send in ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Both Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., had sought to indefinitely
delay a vote on McCain's resolution because they were concerned
that a divisive debate on the Senate floor would send the wrong
signal to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle argued that the Senate didn't need to debate a
resolution authorizing additional force until Clinton asks for it.
The Senate voted in favor of authorizing the air campaign on March
23, the day before that military action began.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate parliamentarian ruled that McCain's resolution
had to come to the Senate floor under the terms of the 1973 War
Powers Act. Congress approved the war powers measure in the waning
days of the Vietnam War to compel presidents to consult Congress in
advance of military action involving U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that the Tuesday vote was designed to avoid a
straight up-or-down ballot on the measure. Instead, the vote will
be on a motion to table the McCain-Biden resolution, thus deferring
it indefinitely.

   Q. My wife and I will be traveling to China in the fall, with
stopovers in Hawaii in both directions. Is there any place at
Honolulu International Airport where items that won't be needed in
China (beach gear, snorkeling equipment, etc.) can be stored? _
Robert F. Koester, Grantham, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. There is such a facility, on the first level of the main
public parking garage, close to baggage-claim areas E and F. It is
open 24 hours a day, with an attendant on duty.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to store equipment and baggage here. The
first is short-term storage (48 hours or less) in coin-operated
lockers. The lockers measure 35 inches high, 19 inches wide and 31
inches deep. The price is $6 a day; you pay $1.50 when you place
the items in the locker and the rest when you pick them up.
</P>
<P>
   For items that will be stored longer than 48 hours, there is a
storage room overseen by the attendant. The charge is $3 a piece
each day, $6 if the piece is longer than 35 inches. The storage fee
can be paid in cash or traveler's checks; no credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   The staff at the storage facility suggests that you leave your
baggage as early in the day as possible. Passengers returning to
the mainland on an afternoon or evening flight will often drop off
their bags in the morning and spend their remaining hours on the
island unencumbered. Information: (808) 836-6683. &QL;

JUSTICES GIVE U.S. DISCRETION IN DECIDING WHICH IMMIGRANTS MERIT
POLITICAL ASYLUM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A unanimous Supreme Court on Monday rejected a
Guatemalan immigrant's bid for political asylum and in the process
gave the federal government broad discretion in deciding which
self-proclaimed freedom fighters merit U.S. protection.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, in their 9-0 ruling, said courts should defer to
the attorney general's decisions on whether an immigrant is
justifiably trying to escape political persecution at home or
merely seeking to avoid legitimate prosecution for having committed
serious nonpolitical crimes. The high court, agreeing with Attorney
General Janet Reno, ruled that the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in San Francisco wrongfully rejected the decision of the
Justice Department's Board of Immigration Affairs, which denied
Juan Anibal Aguirre-Aguirre asylum because his attacks on
Guatemalan civilians, burning of buses and vandalism of stores were
acts not of politics but of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Aguirre-Aguirre had claimed that his behavior was a legitimate
form of political protest in response to the Guatemalan
government's doubling of public transportation fares. But the board
rejected that argument, saying the immigrant's violent response was
grossly disproportional to the government's action.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th Circuit, however, said the board failed to give adequate
consideration to Aguirre-Aguirre's request for asylum.
Specifically, the appeals court said the board should have weighed
three factors: the political necessity and success of Aguirre's
methods, if his acts were atrocious or grossly out of proportion to
their objective, and whether he would be persecuted if returned to
Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   But the Supreme Court, reinstating the board's decision, said
federal judges, including those on the 9th Circuit, should not
interfere with the largely political decision of the attorney
general, an executive branch official, as to whether an immigrant
should be granted asylum. Such decisions are often based not only
on law but on diplomacy, the high court said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (on the Supreme Court) have recognized that judicial
deference to the executive branch is especially appropriate in the
immigration context where officials exercise especially sensitive
political functions that implicate questions of foreign
relations,'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the court in
Immigration and Naturalization Service vs. Aguirre-Aguirre.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decision by the attorney general to deem certain violent
offenses committed in another country political in nature, and to
allow the perpetrators to remain in the United States, may affect
our relations with that country or its neighbors,'' Kennedy said.
``The judiciary is not well positioned to shoulder primary
responsibility for assessing the likelihood and importance of such
diplomatic repercussions.''
</P>
<P>
   The justices also said the bureau was within its statutory
authority to reject Aguirre-Aguirre's request for asylum, a form of
protection U.S. law permits the attorney general to grant to people
who would face persecution in their home countries on account of
their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular
social group or political opinion. The board came to the legitimate
conclusion that Aguirre-Aguirre's acts amounted to serious
nonpolitical crimes and that Guatemala had a sovereign right to
prosecute him for such offenses, the court said.

CLINTON VOWS TO CONTINUE AIR WAR, DESPITE DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite escalating diplomatic activity aimed at
ending the war over Kosovo, President Clinton said Monday that
NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia would continue until President
Slobodan Milosevic withdraws his troops from the province and
allows an international military force to police a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our air campaign cannot stop until Mr. Milosevic shows he is
ready to end the nightmare for the people of Kosovo,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who helped secure the
release of three American GI's held captive in Yugoslavia. But the
president added that there would be no pause in the air war, as
Jackson had sought as a gesture of good will, until Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians are allowed to return to their villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three Americans are home. Their families, their friends and
the American people, whom they have served faithfully, must be
grateful. But nearly 1.5 million Kosovars are not home,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our conditions for ending the bombing are not complicated. The
Kosovars must be able to go home, with security and
self-government. Serbian security forces must leave Kosovo. An
international security force must deploy, with the power not just
to monitor but to protect all the people of Kosovo, Albanians and
Serbs alike,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signalled a possible softening of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization's position by saying that the alliance might
suspend bombing if Yugoslavia initiates ``at least the beginning of
withdrawal of Serb forces'' and meets the other conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The demands came on a day of stepped-up diplomacy, as Clinton
met separately with Jackson and Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's
Balkans envoy who is trying to mediate an end to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton spoke at a news conference with Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi, Jackson arrived at Andrews Air Force Base
outside Washington from his weekend meeting with Milosevic in
Belgrade. The U.S. government did not sanction that meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. soldiers were taken prisoner March 31 along the border
of Macedonia and Yugoslavia and freed Sunday after Jackson appealed
to Milosevic for their release.
</P>
<P>
   After escorting the soldiers to a military base in Germany,
Jackson returned to the United States bearing a letter for Clinton
from Milosevic that proposes a face-to-face meeting as a step to
ending the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   While Jackson wouldn't discuss the contents of the letter,
officials believe that it reiterates Milosevic's insistence that
NATO stop the bombing and withdraw its forces from the region. In
exchange, the Yugoslav leader may allow ethnic Albanians to return
to Kosovo under U.N. auspices.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who toured bombed buildings in Belgrade and held hands
with Milosevic at a prayer meeting, told reporters upon his arrival
in Washington Monday that ``we have a negotiating deal on the table
which should be pursued.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aides rejected Milosevic's overtures, asserting that
Clinton would not meet with the Yugoslav president. ``I would
suggest that he (Milosevic) shouldn't keep too much time available
on his schedule,'' said Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, who has shuttled between Moscow, Belgrade and
western capitals, met with Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials downplayed expectations for a
diplomatic breakthrough, while at the same time they encouraged
Moscow to continue its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This meeting today is not an event; it's part of a process in
which we believe the Russians can play a constructive role,'' said
State Department spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe Russia can play an important role in resolving this
conflict and implementing a political settlement,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin dispatched Chernomyrdin, a
former prime minister, to Washington for the meetings after
speaking with Clinton by phone Sunday about the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Milosevic met with Chernomyrdin and proposed a
peace plan that was immediately rejected by NATO officials because
it would not permit an armed force in Kosovo to enforce a peace
treaty _ something about which NATO is unwavering. Kosovo is a
province of Serbia, the dominant state in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Still, John Steinbrunner, a foreign policy specialist at the
Brookings Institution, said a diplomatic solution might be in a
nascent stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to be wildly optimistic, you can see signs of a
peace agreement in what Jackson and Chernomyrdin are saying. These
are the early signs,'' he said. Brookings is an independent
Washington-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic activity came after a night of intensified NATO
bombing in Yugoslavia in which aircraft began targeting the
nation's electrical grid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the lights went out across 70 percent of the
country, I think, shows that NATO has its finger on the light
switch in Yugoslavia now, and we can turn the power off whenever we
need to and whenever we want to,'' NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said
in Brussels.

WHEN CHILDREN KILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(rm) 
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They seemed, people said at the time, like normal children from
normal families, rattling along the bumpy emotional road that most
people believe represents the normal course of the teen-age years.
</P>
<P>
   But when psychiatrists investigated the suicides of 27 youths in
the Pittsburgh area, interviewing the victims' friends, teachers
and family members, their inquiry revealed not normal teen-agers,
pushed to extreme action by the pressures of modern society, but
severely disturbed adolescents whose psychological problems were
longstanding and whose unhappiness had leeched out in a hundred
clues that were ignored or undetected by those around them.
</P>
<P>
   This contrast between surface assessment and underlying reality,
mental health experts said, is typical of most cases in which
teen-agers have committed acts of extreme violence, killing
themselves or others.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks following the Littleton, Colo., shootings, public
discussion has focused on cultural factors, including media
violence, the availability of guns, video games, the tyranny of
high school cliques and the pressures on students to achieve. And
no one disputes that these pressures on teen-agers are real. But
the deeper truth of what happened at Columbine High, many experts
said, may lie less in the troubles of the world at large, but in
the problems and personal histories of the two teen-age killers,
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.
</P>
<P>
   Much remains unknown about the two young men and their families.
Yet the experts said they will not be surprised if time reveals a
similar disjunction between surface and reality, uncovering a more
complicated story beneath the initial reports of well-adjusted
students in ``utterly normal'' families.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it looks inexplicable, if they don't seem to have the
history of troubled relationships and temperamental difficulties''
said Dr. James Garbarino, professor of human development at Cornell
University and author of ``Lost Boys: Why Our Sons Turn Violent and
How We Can Save Them'' (Free Press, 1999). ``But as the days
proceed and these boys' lives are put under the microscope, we may
begin to see a pattern of early difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   The realization that it is fragile children _ not sturdy ones _
who are most likely to ``break'' has emerged from a growing number
of ``psychological autopsy'' studies of youthful suicides, and from
less formal studies of adolescents who have committed murders. And
though aggression against the self and aggression toward others
were once viewed as distinct entities, research is suggesting that
the two sometimes go together: People who attempt suicide, for
example, show more aggressiveness and impulsiveness throughout
their lifetime than people who are not suicidal.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, other studies have shown that the turbulence,
pathology and confusion considered ``normal'' in adolescence are in
fact far from typical.
</P>
<P>
   In studies of adolescents in the United States and in other
countries, Dr. Daniel Offer and his colleagues at the University of
Chicago found that the rates of mental illness in teen-agers were
identical to those in adults. Though every teen-ager has ups and
downs, ``the typical adolescent is a pretty healthy, happy,
purposeful person,'' said Dr. Kenneth Howard, professor of
psychology at the university who collaborated with Offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your kid is behaving like a `typical adolescent' _ sullen,
depressed, getting poor grades, having trouble with friends _ that
kid needs help, and it's not a phase,'' Howard said.

   In contrast to this upbeat portrait of normal teen-age
development, Dr. David Shaffer and his colleagues at Columbia
University found, in an in-depth study of 120 adolescents in the
New York area who committed suicide between June 1, 1984, and May
31, 1986, that 90 percent suffered from a diagnosable psychiatric
disorder, such as major depression or another ``mood disorder,''
alcohol or drug abuse, previous suicide attempts or disruptive
behavior. And in more than a third of the New York suicides, the
symptoms had begun more than five years before the victim's death.
</P>
<P>
   Among the risk factors identified by Shaffer and other
investigators, including Dr. David Brent, the child psychiatrist
who conducted the study of the 27 Pittsburgh suicides, were
difficulties in school, neither being in school nor working, a
family history of suicide, a significant lack of ``satisfying
communication'' with parents, exposure to parental discord or
abuse, and stressful life events, particularly disciplinary or
legal problems, and interpersonal losses.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. J. John Mann, Dr. Victoria Arango at Columbia University and
other investigators have added to this complicated package the
finding that suicide victims have lowered levels of serotonin, a
messenger chemical, in areas of the brain's frontal lobe involved
with planning and impulse control, indicating that biological
factors may also leave some people less able to resist acting on
suicidal urges.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, studies of youthful murderers frequently find in such
children a history of abuse, humiliation, terror or neglect, as
well as evidence of psychiatric disorders and neurological
abnormalities. Often, teen-age murderers show a pattern of
disturbed relationships with others and destructive behavior that
only comes to light after they commit a crime.

   For example, Luke Woodham, who in 1997 killed his mother and two
students and wounded seven other students at his Pearl, Miss., high
school, had been seen beating his dog with a club, wrapping it in a
plastic bag, setting it on fire and tossing it into a pond,
Garbarino writes in ``Lost Boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Also common in many children who erupt in violence, said many
experts, is a deadening of human feeling _ a striking inability to
feel remorse, love, or empathy toward another human being. Dr.
Bruce Perry, chief of psychiatry at Texas Children's Hospital in
Houston, said such children may know that they have done something
wrong, but are unable to connect to their action in an emotional
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sat in my office with a 14-year-old child who two days
previously had killed somebody,'' Perry recalled, ``and he sat in
my office and colored and talked about it almost as if he were
describing a sporting event he had observed, instead of an event
that he had caused.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar dissociation from reality was expressed by Woodham in
his tape recorded confession: ``It was like I was there and I
wasn't there,'' he said. And Columbine High students described the
chilling detachment of Harris and Klebold as they made their bloody
circuit through the school, killing 12 students and a teacher
before committing suicide.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Littleton shootings, the hunger for answers
has focused attention on guns, media violence, video games and the
pressures on school children to achieve. But the message from
studies of adolescents who kill others or themselves is that no
single factor can explain their actions. Instead, researchers say,
children who kill must be seen as extremely vulnerable children who
accumulate risk throughout their lives and finally succumb:
Garbarino likens it to ``a tower of blocks. You put one more block
on the tower, and it topples over.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, rates of both teen-age suicides and homicides committed
by teen-agers have risen sharply over the last three decades,
leveling off recently at their all-time highs. And the onset of
mental disorders like depression, manic depression and alcoholism
is earlier than it once was. More than 1.5 million Americans under
age 15 are seriously depressed, according to the National Institute
of Mental Health. Other estimates put the figure even higher.
</P>
<P>
   Vulnerable children, because they are the first to falter, offer
a warning, marking the fault lines in a culture in which more and
more children are taking their own or others' lives. Teen-agers,
said Michael Meade, founder of Mosaic, a Washington state-based
organization devoted to working with adolescents at risk, are
desperately hungry ``for genuine involvement and genuine
attention.'' In a world of violent images, ready availability of
guns and pressure to succeed, adults, he says, cannot start
listening too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Mann of Columbia put it more bluntly:. ``When vulnerable kids
crack, the weapons that are at hand make the consequences of that
vulnerability more serious.''

FLEET TO MOVE INTO BANKBOSTON QUARTERS IN MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- He coveted his competitor's business for years; soon
he will occupy his rival's manor.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence Murray, chief executive of Fleet Financial Group Inc.,
will find himself ensconced in a new executive suite at BankBoston
Corp. when the two banks, which are merging, set up their new
corporate headquarters at BankBoston later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Announced Monday, the two companies' decision to use
BankBoston's imposing tower at 100 Federal St. as home base puts
the combined bank in one of downtown Boston's most dramatic
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   By moving some of its staff and operations from its headquarters
at One Federal St. across the road to BankBoston, Fleet will free
up a large chunk of highly coveted commercial space in a booming
property market with little vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know, nor does the bank, how much, if any, space
could be freed up,'' said Mark M. Weld, a senior director at
Clarion Partners, a Boston-based real estate firm that owns and
manages One Federal.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to use BankBoston's structure as headquarters is
grounded in symbolic and practical significance. Though the two
banks describe their merger into the nation's eighth-largest bank
as a combination of equals, Fleet, the larger of the two, is
technically acquiring BankBoston _ a fact underscored by Fleet's
impending move into its rival's building.
</P>
<P>
   A 37-story structure of mahogany granite, BankBoston's building
boasts modern facilities and a striking profile. Built for the bank
in 1971, the tower includes retail shops, a state-of-the-art
trading floor, a pedestrian plaza, and, on the top floor, the
Boston College Club.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Fleet's 40-story skyscraper, also built in the
1970s, is a gray, stone aggregate. Fleet has 11 floors, with
executive suites at the top, just below the Harvard Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``After reviewing our corporate facilities and taking into
account our projected needs, the selection of 100 Federal to be our
headquarters makes sound business sense,'' Murray said in a
statement Monday. But when the combination was announced in March,
Murray joked that while BankBoston was prettier than Fleet on the
exterior, Fleet was nicer inside.
</P>
<P>
   Murray and his counterpart at BankBoston, Charles K. Gifford,
decided to use BankBoston after reviewing facilities plans. The
decision, taken earlier than expected, may have been speeded up to
give the two companies a jump start in melding their operations and
cultures. Fleet won't begin moving into BankBoston until the merger
is finalized later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Once with headquarters in Providence, Fleet relocated to Boston
in 1995 when it acquired Shawmut National Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry between scrappy Fleet and patrician BankBoston
extended in recent years even to architectural matters. Fleet
renovated its imposing lobby six years ago, prompting BankBoston to
seek to do the same, only better, Weld said.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston leases all but three of 100 Federal's 37 floors from
the Atlanta-based real estate arm of French insurer Equitable Axa.
Around 4,100 of the bank's 25,000 employees are at the building,
which is known as ``the pregnant building'' for its distinctive
bulge. About 1,000 of Fleet's 35,000 employees are at Fleet
headquarters.

 &HT;    AMERICAN POWS REUNITED WITH FAMILIES, UNDERGO FURTHER MEDICAL
TESTS
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-STRIKES-0504.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDSTUHL, Germany _ In a private day behind the walls of an
American military hospital, the three U.S. soldiers who spent 32
days as POWs in Yugoslavia were reunited with their families and
underwent further medical tests that showed their capture by Serb
forces was more brutal than it first appeared.
</P>
<P>
   The servicemen spent their first full day of freedom in
tearfully happy meetings with their parents, siblings and other
relatives, who flew overnight from the United States to arrive in
Germany on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The three soldiers and their families appeared briefly for the
cameras on the balcony of the hospital wing. All smiles, they gave
the thumbs-up and OK signs. ``It's great!'' some shouted to
reporters below.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, officials at the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center
released further details of the injuries the three suffered,
indicating that the soldiers were beaten severely during and
perhaps after their capture by Serb forces on March 31 on the
border of Yugoslavia and Macedonia, where the U.S. peacekeepers
were based.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three suffered broken bones, revealed in x-rays and
other examinations since their arrival in Germany on Sunday
following their release negotiated by the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich., has a broken nose
that is healing and Andrew Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles had two
broken ribs which have begun to heal and will require no further
treatment, said Col. Mack Blanton, chief of clinical services at
the hospital. Ramirez also lost 11 pounds during his incarceration.
The third former POW is Steven Gonzales, 22, of Huntsville, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lingering injuries, Blanton said the three were in
``generally good health.'' Blanton said they were upbeat about
visiting their families.
</P>
<P>
   They are expected to remain in the hospital, near the Ramstein
Air Base in southwestern Germany, for another two or three days.
President Clinton will arrive in Germany on Wednesday. White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton would like to meet with the
three servicemen and their families, but that the president did not
want to delay their return home.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the servicemen were captured, Yugoslav authorities
released videotape showing the soldiers badly bruised. The
servicemen said after they had left Yugoslavia on Sunday that their
treatment was generally good after the initial confrontation with
the forces that nabbed them.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. David Grange, commander of the U.S. Army's 1st
Infantry Division, said he suspected the soldiers were treated more
harshly than their initial public comments suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that all the treatment was well,'' Grange said.
``I think it might have been they were poorly treated at the
beginning, but that'll be determined.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether the soldiers were exhibiting the so-called
Stockholm syndrome, where those imprisoned begin to identify
psychologically with their captors, Grange said, ``The
investigation will determine that, and I think you'll see mixed
results.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of interview with the soldiers so far, Grange said
he was convinced that ``they were definitely in Macedonia,'' not in
Yugoslav territory as Serb authorities have maintained when they
were captured while on patrol in a Humvee military vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials said the complete account of the soldiers' ordeal
and the circumstances of their capture would be aired when their
investigation is completed later this week.
</P>
<P>
   After taking 30 days of leave, the soldiers were likely to
return to their units, which are based in Germany, Bacon said.

DELL, NORWEGIANS TEAM TO CREATE TOP WEB SEARCHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Norwegian company is teaming up with Dell Computer Corp. to
create a new Internet search engine they claim will be the most
comprehensive ever.
</P>
<P>
   Fast Search &AMP; Transfer Inc. says its new site, which begins
operation Tuesday at www.alltheweb.com, already has 80 million
indexed Web pages. That compares with about 150 million pages
indexed by the popular AltaVista search site and 125 million pages
in the Northern Light index of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   But Fast president David Burns says his service will be up to
200 million pages by summer. Burns also said the new search system
developed by his firm will enable the company to eventually create
the first index of the entire World Wide Web. ``When you search the
whole Web,'' said Burns, ``you can find sites that are those
absolute gems.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the magazine Science estimated the Web contained 320
million pages, and it has continued to grow rapidly since then.
</P>
<P>
   But Burns said Fast will be able to keep up. It is based on a
new search architecture developed by computer scientists at Fast's
parent company in Oslo. The new system should make it relatively
simple to increase the size of the index merely by connecting more
and more computers.
</P>
<P>
   Dell will provide the hardware _ rack-mounted PC servers with
Intel Pentium II processors. These computers are located at the
Waltham, Mass. facility of Exodus Communications Inc., one of the
nation's leading Web-hosting companies, which houses and provides
security and maintenance for other companies' Internet computers.
</P>
<P>
   The same building houses the computers that drive the Lycos
search service, and Lycos' headquarters is less than a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   Burns is a former Lycos executive, and Fast has built
specialized search engines for Lycos. The controversial MP3 search
service that lets Lycos users find free digital music recordings on
the Internet is operated by Fast.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos' own Web search engine contains about 50 million pages,
far fewer than the number claimed by Fast. But Burns isn't looking
to compete with Lycos or any of the other major search sites.
Instead, he wants these companies to license the Fast search engine
and host it on their own sites. Fast's chief competitor is Inktomi
Corp. of San Mateo, Calif., whose search engine powers the Lycos
Hotbot site.
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers like Curt Monash, president of Elucidate
Technologies LLC of Lexington, Mass., scoff at Fast's
bigger-is-better approach to Web searching. Monash argued that
today's search engines already provide too much information,
overwhelming users with too much information. Enlarging the index
will only make matters worse, Monash said. ``Having a bigger piece
of mediocrity is not that big an accomplishment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Burns figures that Web portals will combine the Fast search
service with other kinds of Web indexes to give a more precise
method for finding exactly what the user is searching for.

GATES PLEDGES $25 MILLION TO HELP DEVELOP AIDS VACCINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Software mogul William H. Gates Monday pledged $25 million over
five years to help develop a vaccine against AIDS, an effort for
which President Clinton has set a 2007 deadline but which has shown
frustratingly slow progress to date.
</P>
<P>
   Through his $5.2 billion charitable foundation, the Microsoft
founder and chairman will more than double the yearly budget of the
International Aids Vaccine Initiative, a New York-based nonprofit
partnership funded by several foundations and United Nations
groups. Last December, Gates pledged $100 million for improving
access to vaccines among Third World children.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative's president, Dr. Seth Berkley, said Gates's
``historic act of generosity will allow us to significantly
accelerate the scientific effort'' but that his group estimates it
needs another $300 million to $500 million to succeed. The Alfred
P. Sloan Foundation Monday pledged another $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, only one possible AIDS vaccine is undergoing
so-called phase 3 trials with human volunteers, the final stage
before the Food and Drug Administration considers approval.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 5,000 US volunteers are expected to sign up for tests of
the Vaxgen Inc. product called AIDSvax, which seeks to keep the
human immunodeficiency virus from entering body cells rather than
stimulating antibodies to kill already infected cells. Boston's
Fenway Community Health Center is participating in the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago officials in Uganda, where nearly one in 10
residents is infected with the AIDS virus, launched smaller-scale
tests of a French product that uses a canary pox virus to carry HIV
genes and trigger development of antibodies against versions of HIV
found in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 possible vaccines to prevent AIDS have been
identified in recent years. But because so many different viral
strains cause AIDS, and they manipulate cells to hide from the
body's immune system, developing a vaccine has proved
extraordinarily complicated.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton pledged in May 1997 to ``do all I can'' to develop
an AIDS vaccine by 2007, US researchers have been especially
concerned about rushing into tests that could infect volunteers

pharmaceutical companies are dragging their feet on vaccines

PARENT SPY (Phoenix) - In the wake of the Littleton, Colo.,
massacre, parents want to know what their teens are up to. So how
far can they go in divining whether their child has a secret life?
Can they barge into his room unannounced and without knocking? Can
they search his room when he's not home? Read his diary? And how do
teens feel about this invasion of privacy? By HANK HUGHES. Story
will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
F-16 CRASHES (Phoenix) - Air Force officials say half the recent
fighter jet crashes in Arizona could have been prevented if engine
problems detected in earlier mishaps had been corrected sooner. By
JENNIFER BARRETT. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
INTERNET-SEXOFFENDERS - The eerie galleries of photos are just a
few mouse clicks away on the Internet. Rapists, child molesters and
flashers stare out from the screen. You can find their names,
addresses, ages and descriptions of their crimes. There's the
Chandler, Ariz., man who spent 10 years in prison for attempted sex
acts with a 10-year-old. A few more clicks lead to the Yuma man
convicted of sexual abuse and attempted sexual assault, who was
jailed two years ago for failing to register as a sex offender. You
can check out molesters in Michigan, rapists in North Carolina and
Alaska's 1,600-plus sex offenders. It's all part of a national rush
to use the Internet to alert the public to the identity and
whereabouts of registered sex offenders. At last count, 15 states
were listing sex offenders on websites, with more in the pipeline.
By KATHLEEN INGLEY. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
STRONGARM CHIP (Phoenx) - Intel reveals details about the StrongArm
chip that's being developed in Chandler, Ariz. By REBECCA ROLWING.
Story moved move in the ``F'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - I missed seeing ``Star Wars'' when it
was released in 1977. It was an innocent thing that has developed
into a solemn crusade. All the hype surrounding the films in the
series led me to vow never to see any of them, to plant myself on
the shore of American popular culture and not be swept away by
George Lucas's tidal wave. To boldly declare, ``The Chewbacca stops
here.'' It hasn't been easy. By E.J. MONTINI. Story moved in the
``A'' and ``K'' categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
COMPUTER-COLUMN (Phoenix) - What say we learn how to design a Web
page? &QL; 
Aah, come on! It's easy! At least it's easier than filling out your
annual income tax returns.Why should you bother creating your own
Web page? I can think of several reasons. Here are two:1) The Web
is an invaluable tool for communicating with people in your
neighborhood and around the world. Be a part of it!2) You might
already have free ``Web space'' at your disposal. By DAVID HOYE.

 &HT;    REBUTTAL WITNESSES NAMED FOR FINAL PHASE OF MICROSOFT TRIAL
 &HT;    Moved in both (w) Washington) and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON Barring a last-minute settlement, the Microsoft
antitrust trial will enter the payoff phase, probably in late May,
with the warring parties seeking to overcome weak spots in their
initial arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and Microsoft each named three rebuttal
witnesses Monday. They will use those witnesses to try to gain the
upper hand during the crucial period of the case, which promises to
shape antitrust law in the high-tech field for the coming century.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will call David Colburn, senior vice president for
business affairs of America Online; Gordon Eubanks, president and
chief executive officer of Oblix Inc.; and Richard Schmalensee,
acting dean of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   The government witnesses will be Garry Norris, an International
Business Machines executive; Franklin Fisher of MIT, who in earlier
testimony argued that Windows has given Microsoft monopoly powers
that it has used to engage in anti-competitive business practices;
and Edward Felten, a computer science professor at Princeton
University and earlier witness.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 19 states, which sued the software
giant nearly a year ago, must seek to show how Microsoft's hardball
business tactics have harmed consumers by driving up prices or by
curtailing innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Before a Feb. 26 recess, government prosecutors offered
compelling evidence that Microsoft repeatedly used its
Windows-based market dominance to pressure personal computer makers
and software companies to dance to its tune, especially in their
choices of Internet browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the rebuttal case for the defense is aimed at
persuading U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is
presiding over the trial without a jury, that Microsoft's power
over the personal computer market is limited and, perhaps in the
long run, transitory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our rebuttal witnesses will show that the $10 billion merger
of AOL and Netscape completely undercuts the government's case,''
said William Neukom, Microsoft's general counsel. ``Our rebuttal
witnesses will also show that competition and innovation are
stronger than ever in the software industry, and that consumers are
seeing extraordinary benefits from Microsoft and the industry as a
whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Colburn, who had testified for the government in October, will
be questioned as a hostile witness. Microsoft said in papers filed
with the court Monday that it will seek to show how the recent
merger of America Online and Netscape Communications undermines the
government's contention that Microsoft was seeking to lock in a
dominant position in Internet commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In view of the merger and evidence Microsoft has gathered
through court-authorized discovery, the company will also question
Colburn about ``the completeness and candor of prior testimony''
given by Colburn in this case, the court papers said.
</P>
<P>
   Eubanks is a former top figure at Symantec, a leading software
utilities maker. At Oblix, Eubanks heads a privately held business
directory software firm that is based in Silicon Valley. It counts
Netscape, Novell, and Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, a leading
venture capital firm, among its investors.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials said Eubanks will testify on the dynamic
competition that exists throughout the software industry, and the
benefits of that competition for innovation and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Schmalensee stumbled on the stand last January when he appeared
for Microsoft. David Boies, the government's lead lawyer, had
confronted him with an essay Schmalensee wrote 16 years ago that
seemingly contradicted his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``My immediate reaction is, what could I have been thinking,''
Schmalensee said then, adding that the earlier essay ``does not
provide a good indication of my present views.
</P>
<P>
   In court documents unsealed Monday, IBM, the world's largest
computer maker, presented evidence to support the government's
charge that Microsoft has used its Windows software licenses to
maintain a choke hold on computer makers.
</P>
<P>
   Norris, the government witness, is a former director of software
strategy for IBM and currently program director in the networking
hardware division, a mid-level post. He is expected to contend that
Microsoft imposes restrictions that exclude competing technologies
while punishing manufacturers by charging them more for Windows if
they fail to act as a Microsoft strategic partner.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is not expected to resume before May 24.

   British Telecom is offering customers in certain areas trial
tests of Freetime, a service wherein calls are free but talkers are
interrupted by 10-second advertisements every two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Telegraph of London, such systems are in use in
Sweden, Denmark and Italy, ``where they have proved to be popular
with teenagers and cash-strapped households but an irritant to
anybody else.''
</P>

   A 10-second ad plays at the beginning of the call, before the

<P>
   _ The vote to authorize a congressional medal for civil rights
hero  &UR; Rosa Parks &LR;  was 424 to 1, reports the Hill, the lone nay cast
by Rep.  &UR; Ron Paul &LR; , R-Texas. The congressman, a Libertarian,
``votes against anything that he thinks the Founding Fathers did
not explicitly contemplate,'' says the Hill.
</P>
<P>
   He said in a speech that he has ``great respect for the courage
and high ideals of Rosa Parks ... who is widely recognized and
admired for standing up against an overbearing government
infringing on individual rights.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Michael Wysor &LR; , a physician who this month patented an
ointment that he claims could help women have orgasms, exulted to
the New York Times, ``It increases blood flow tremendously and
basically eliminates the need for foreplay.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Muhammad Ali &LR;  will appear  &LR; May 9  &LR; on ``Touched by an Angel''
to get across the message that violence is not a solution to life's
problems. ``Fighting is not the answer to frustration and hate,''
he told TV Guide. ``It is a sport, not a philosophy of life. I do
not promote anybody becoming a professional boxer. I would prefer
children use it as a springboard, not a career choice.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Miramax mogul  &UR; Harvey Weinstein  &LR; insisted on smoking a cigar
aboard the Concorde a few weeks ago, and when his &LR;  the plane landed
at Heathrow, the Times of London says, he received a summons. When
the case came up in court, shortly afterward, Weinstein was a
no-show. An aide told the British newspaper, ``We know nothing
about this.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for British Airways said that apparently Weinstein
``does this all the time,'' but his ``behavior is very unusual for
Concorde. There is a small customer base of regular Concorde
travelers, including Hollywood celebrities and captains of
industry, who have a quiet air of confidence about their
influence.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Mirror of London says  &UR; Sharon Stone &LR;  plays a woman
accidentally sawed in half by magician  &UR; Woody Allen &LR;  in Allen's
next film, ``Picking Up the Pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Italian newspapers are reporting that  &UR; Monica Lewinsky  &LR; is
talking with the Italian film company Filmauro about appearing in a
Christmas movie. Filmauro is best known for sex comedies.
</P>
<P>
   _ In preparation for a possible cable TV show based on his
magazine, George,  &UR; John F. Kennedy Jr. &LR;  has been taking TV lessons.
MSNBC says he had to learn not to look skyward when he was
thinking, which used to be a habit. ``It made his eyes all white
and sort of spooky,'' said an eyewitness.

   &UR; LOCAL PRIDE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ San Francisco makes the grade: The pesticide manufacturer
d-Con is out with its annual top 10 list of cities with rodents,
and we're No. 9. The leader, the city with ``the worst mouse
problem'' in the country, is Los Angeles, followed by New York, San
Antonio, Salt Lake City tied with Boise, Dallas, Philadelphia,
Houston, Chicago, San Francisco and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   _ Describing a perfect day in the life of a San Franciscan, in
the latest issue of GQ,  &UR; Owen Edwards &LR;  drops the following place
names: Lake Merced's UCSF boathouse, Peet's on Fillmore; &LR; , the
Golden Gate Bridge; &LR; , Skywalker Ranch, Nicasio Reservoir, the
Station House Cafe in Point Reyes Station, Billy Blue haberdasher,

CAROLINA DEFENSEMAN'S DEATH SHOCKS NFL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than six hours after they eliminated Carolina, the Bruins'
playoff victory became a footnote to tragedy early Monday morning
when veteran Hurricanes defenseman Steve Chiasson, 32, was killed
in a one-car accident while driving to his home in suburban
Raleigh, N.C., following the team's charter flight from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   According to the North Carolina State Highway Patrol, Chiasson
was thrown from his pickup truck when it overturned in north
Raleigh at about 4:15 a.m., a little more than three hours after
the Hurricanes' charter touched down at Raleigh-Durham
International Airport following their 2-0 loss at the FleetCenter
in Game 6 of their best-of-seven Eastern Conference quarterfinal.
Sergeant M.R. Johnson, a police spokesman, indicated that alcohol
was a factor, according to evidence at the scene and interviews
with witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our investigation is continuing,'' said Johnson in a phone
interview. ``We're still looking into a lot regarding the wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   The medical examiner's office said no autopsy would be
performed, and Johnson estimated that Chiasson's blood-alcohol
level would be determined when a toxicology report is completed in
two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel comfortable in saying that alcohol was involved,'' said
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Team spokesman Chris Brown said by telephone that, along with
several nonalcoholic beverages, the Hurricanes carried two cases of
beer on a charter that numbered 52 passengers, and when the plane
landed, there was no indication that Chiasson was impaired or even
had been drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Trooper K.L. Horn and Sergeant J.D. Henderson were
at the scene of the accident and went to the family home ``sometime
before 6 a.m.'' to inform Chiasson's wife, Susan, of her husband's
death. The couple have three children _ Michael, 7; Ryan, 4; and
Stephanie, 2.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference late in the morning, Hurricanes
president/general manager Jim Rutherford told reporters that, after
the plane landed, ``It was my understanding that we were all
heading home. I got a call at approximately 5:30 this morning from
a player to say that (Chiasson) had the accident. I don't know
exactly who was with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford added that he and ``a lot of players'' gathered at a
teammate's house soon after learning of the fatality and called
``players, coaches, and trainers and all the people close to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The death of Chiasson _ a onetime All-Star whose 12-year NHL
career included tours of duty in Detroit, Calgary, Hartford, and
Carolina _ sent shock waves throughout the league. ``When a young
life ends prematurely, when a young family loses a husband and
father,'' said commissioner Gary Bettman in a statement, ``words
cannot begin to express our sorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The news hit particularly hard in Raleigh and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricanes coach Paul Maurice, who last remembered seeing
Chiasson in the vistors' locker room at the FleetCenter when
Maurice addressed the team after Sunday's loss, said in a phone
interview, ``I think we're all still quite a bit in shock, probably
a little disoriented by the whole thing. When you spend that much
time with someone, get to know their family . . . you know how it
is in this situation. You come to rely on each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurice was awakened with the news at about 6 a.m. by
Rutherford's call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so shocking,'' he said, ``that even as I'm sitting here
talking to you, I still can't believe it. The understatement is
that it puts things in perspective _ and that's really an
understatement. Everybody gets home and gives their wife and kids a
hug.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricane players will assemble at the rink Tuesday, when he
will address them about the situation, said Maurice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough day,'' he said, ``and we have a few more
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Rutherford described Chiasson _
considered a team leader, though he wasn't a captain _ as ``the
kind of guy everybody wants to be around. Certainly a big member
with his teammates and just a real ordinary guy that loved the game
of hockey and that loved the people around him.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston the news cast an eerie pall over the Bruins' first
playoff series triumph in five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody around here is just silent; it put a damper on the
whole series,'' said Bruins president/GM Harry Sinden, who was
informed of the tragedy by his office on his car phone while
driving to work at about 9:30. ``I had a sunken feeling. You don't
have much time to enjoy a series victory, and you just can't when
something like that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden acknowledged that Chiasson had been one of Carolina's top
performers in the series, playing steady defense, manning a point
on the power play, and killing penalties. But that had become
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fact that a guy left a wife and three kids at 32
is the real tragedy,'' he said. ``I didn't know him, but no matter
how you look at it, it's like one of our own. They get the feeling
of being invulnerable, players do.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Sinden suggested that teams might consider
providing transportation home for the players after season-ending
flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's happened before,'' he said. ``After you lose like that,
there probably is a tendency to . . . commiserate a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   Meaning drink, although the Hurricanes contend that was not the
situation on their flight and Sinden said that during the season,
``There is so little alcohol consumed by the Bruins on charters.
Maybe just one beer. Some flights there's none at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the apparent alcohol factor, Bruins Anson Carter and
teammate Landon Wilson considered Chiasson's death a cautionary
tale for another reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we drive home after a charter,'' said Wilson, ``it's
amazing we haven't gotten in an accident. We're in such a rush.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a speed demon going home,'' said Carter. ``That's going to
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most stunned was Bruins assistant general manager Mike
O'Connell, Chiasson's Detroit teammate and defensive mentor in the
late '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was a rookie, he was a fine guy _ he is a fine guy,''
said O'Connell, who was called at home by his office with the news.
``He leaned on a few of us older guys to get him started _ how to
buy a house, what to do, how to handle situations. He was a warrior
on the ice, a true throwback hockey player, someone you'd love to
have on your team.''
</P>
<P>
   To defuse the tragedy, O'Connell savored a memory of his
erstwhile protege. At the end of Chiasson's rookie season, after he
had played on the world junior team, he and O'Connell were among
several Red Wings drinking in a downtown Detroit bar. Wayne Gretzky
also was there with his Edmonton entourage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne came up to me, we said hi, and we talked for a little
bit,'' said O'Connell. ``Then Gretzky left.''
</P>
<P>
   The Great One had ignored Chiasson, who didn't expect any
recognition _ then was stunned when Gretzky returned, walked up to
him, and extended his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Steve, I'm Wayne Gretzky' _ as if Steve didn't know
that,'' said O'Connell. ``Then Wayne told him, `I just wanted to
tell you I thought you did a great job in the world juniors.' And
he walked out again. Steve said to me, `Imagine _ him knowing me.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Now a much wider audience knows Steve Chiasson. Tragically.

<P>
   PHOENIX - It's not like I didn't go to movies in 1977. If
someone that year had asked me which pictures I'd seen, I'd
probably have said, ``All of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, though, I missed ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   I was just out of college, still deciding what I wanted to be
when I grew up, still trying to make sense of the world, still
hoping to ``find'' myself.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, I was exactly the same, only with longer hair.
</P>
<P>
   This was before HBO, VCRs and Blockbuster. The only place to see
a film without commercials was in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   So, I went.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturday Night Fever'' came out in 1977. And ``Annie Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   And ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind.'' And ``Pumping
Iron.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't miss any of them.
</P>
<P>
   I even saw ``The Goodbye Girl,'' although, thinking back, that
might have had something to do with the beautiful, brown-eyed
reporter I'd met at a small paper in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   She was just out of college, too, already a grown-up, already
making sense of the world, and with no need to ``find'' herself, as
she'd never been lost.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the reality of a woman left me with no need to escape into
science fiction. It's difficult to say after all this time.
</P>
<P>
   But the year came and went, and for me no ``Star Wars''.
</P>
<P>
   I remember hearing about the movie, and reading about it, and
seeing reports on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Darth Vader was a bigger bad guy in 1977 than Gary Gilmore, the
convicted murderer whose heart was stopped by firing squad.
</P>
<P>
   The names of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia were in the news
as much as Elvis Presley, whose heart was stopped that year by
fried peanut butter sandwiches and prescripton drugs.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't tell you anything about Han Solo in 1977, but I knew
everything about the three solo home runs Reggie Jackson hit in
successive at-bats in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   By the time ``The Empire Strike Back'' was released in 1980, I'd
begin telling people that I had, in fact, seen ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   `'Loved that R2D2,'' I'd say.
</P>
<P>
   It was easier than trying to explain how I possibly could have
missed the movie. But, with no ``Star Wars'' experience, I was in
no hurry to see ``Empire.'' And never got around to it.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Return of the Jedi'' was a different story.
</P>
<P>
   By 1983, the publicity was overwhelming. What began as an
innocent lapse in my movie-going plans, developed into a solemn
crusade.
</P>
<P>
   I became determined NEVER see any movie in the series, to plant
myself on the shore of American popular culture and not be swept
away by George Lucas's tidal wave.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been easy, over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before ``Return of the Jedi'' was released, the
brown-eyed woman gave birth to our first child. Since then, there's
been another.
</P>
<P>
   Video versions of all three films have found their way into my
living room at one time or another. Most likely rented for the
kids, or carted over by friends.
</P>
<P>
   There was a close call just last summer, when my little boy had
``Star Wars'' in the VCR for nearly 10 minutes, ejecting it only
after I dangled ``Tarzan's New York Adventure'' before his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The monkey beat the robots - for now.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out. The insane hoopla
for ``The Phantom Menace'' has sliced through the American psyche
like a light saber.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the movie, but the toys, the advertising, the
magazine covers, the TV interviews, the previews, the music videos,
the video games, the comic books, the web sites, and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to beat back that kind of assault, even when armed
with classics like ``Captain Blood,'' ``She Wore A Yellow Ribbon,''
``Duck Soup'' and ``The Incredible Mr. Limpet''.
</P>
<P>
   But, I believe someone's got to try. Someone's got to make a
stand. Someone got to look the monster in the eye and say:
</P>
<P>
   The Chewbacca stops here. &QL;

SEA OTTERS MAY BE PLACED ON ENDANGERED LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE KAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The population of sea otters along the
California coast is dropping so quickly that scientists fear it
could be approaching extinction.
</P>
<P>
   After a calamitous centuries-long decline, then a revival, the
numbers started falling again in 1995 by about 90 per year. The
most recent count, late last year, estimates that only 1,937
survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``More otters are dying each year than being born,'' said
biologist Carl Benz, who heads a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
team responsible for the recovery of sea otters. ``If this trend
continues, it's entirely possible that this species may go
extinct.''
</P>
<P>
   The otter, the smallest marine mammal species on Earth, is
believed partly to be the victim of infectious disease, water
contaminants, fish nets and fishing pots.
</P>
<P>
   Just four years ago, scientists were hopeful the population
might grow to at least 8,000 within four decades, perhaps up to
30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1977, the year that sea otters went on the Endangered
Species Act's list of threatened species, the numbers had edged up
every year to an all-time high of 2,377 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1995 the spring count has dropped by 11 percent, and
Benz says that if the trend continues, the Fish and Wildlife
Service may move to declare the otter endangered, a step that would
increase protections and the likelihood of research funding. The
agency has estimated that 1,850 is the smallest population required
to maintain a sustainable population off the coast, although the
number may be revised downward.
</P>
<P>
   Even as their numbers drop, otters are slowly expanding north
and south along the coast. The range now extends 240 miles from
Half Moon Bay in San Mateo County to Cojo Anchorage south of Point
Conception in Santa Barbara County.
</P>
<P>
   In Monterey Bay, otters are a popular attraction as they float
on their backs while loudly cracking open clams on their stomachs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think that they'll be there forever and ever,'' said
biologist Steve Alcorn, deputy leader of the otter recovery team
leader at Fish and Wildlife. ``And that may not be the case. This
population is no longer recovering, and mortality appears to be
spread along all ages. It's a difficult thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are finding dead and stranded otters on beaches at
higher numbers than ever _ about 200 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is only a portion of the ones that are dying,'' Alcorn
said. ``It doesn't account for the animals that never wash up on
the beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists, who hope to gain about $1.7 million per year for
five years to explore the causes, cite numerous theories for the
troubles:
</P>
<P>
   _ Infectious disease. The National Wildlife Health Lab in
Madison, Wis., run by Fish and Wildlife, has found that since 1992
more than 40 percent of dead otters carry infectious diseases,
including parasitic worms and encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fishing equipment. Sea otters can become entangled and drown
in large-mesh gillnets, and gillnet fishing is increasing in
southern Monterey Bay. Regulations require nets to be set in waters
deeper than 180 feet to spare otters, but otters go into deeper
waters, too. The commercial fishing industries are beginning to use
pots that have a funnel shaped interior, which can trap otters as
they venture inside.
</P>
<P>
   _ Starvation. Otters eat 25 percent to 30 percent of their body
weight a day. Some scientists believe there's a scarcity of sea
urchin, abalone and crab, as well as otters' less preferred foods:
mussels, squid and starfish in the middle of the range.
</P>
<P>
   _ Natural predators. As otters expand their range north of Santa
Cruz, some of the dead ones show signs of white shark attack.
</P>
<P>
   _ Speedboats. There are a few reports of boats' striking sea
otters in Elkhorn Slough at Moss Landing and in other spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there are any clear answers,'' said Jim Estes, a
marine biologist at the U.S. Geological Survey's Biological
Resources Division at the University of California at Santa Cruz.
``But we know some things. Infectious disease is a major cause of
mortality based on all the fresh carcasses since the early 1990s.
There's no question that this has been an important factor in the
failure of the California sea otter population to recover
rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito, parasitologist Murray
Dailey is trying to isolate the types and life cycles of
acanthocephalan worms that infest otters. The pathology department
at the University of California at Davis also is studying ways in
which otters may pick up the deadly organisms, perhaps in sewage or
by eating carrier animals.
</P>
<P>
   Estes wants more study on whether otters are drowning in droves,
which occurred in the 1980s, before new regulations controlled
gillnets. More fish pots, which catch live animals for market, are
being used on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sea otters once extended into the northern Japanese archipelago
to the east coast of Kamchatka eastward through the Commander
Islands, Aleutian archipelago and Pribiloff Islands to the Alaska
Peninsula and along the Pacific Coast of North America to about
central Baja California.
</P>
<P>
   Before fur traders nearly wiped out the southern population
between 1742 and 1911 _ leaving only 50 animals on the Central
Coast _ an estimated 20,000 lived from middle Oregon to central
Baja California. Worldwide, the number dropped to 2,000 from
300,000. An International Fur Seal Treaty in 1911 protected otters.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are 100,000 around the world, with about 98,000 in
the northern population of Alaskan and British Columbian waters and
the balance along the California coast.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, because of the small number of animals, the limited
distribution and the increasing threat from oil spills, otters were
listed as threatened, preventing oil, fishing and other industries
from conducting activities that killed or harassed them.
</P>
<P>
   Sea otters thrive in a narrow ecological zone of rocky
shorelines and kelp beds. Adult males weigh an average 64 pounds
and are 4 1/2 feet long, compared with 43 pounds and 4 feet for
females. They use their padded and clawed forepaws for voracious
feeding and grooming and their flipper-like hind legs for graceful
aquatic locomotion.
</P>
<P>
   Their reddish-brown fur is glossy and so dense that some animals
have 650,000 hairs per square inch. The fur traps air and insulates
them from cold sea water, unlike seals and whales, which have
blubber for insulation. Otters have little subcutaneous fat for
energy storage and must constantly feed.

hoping to ``find'' myself.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, I was exactly the same, only with longer hair.
</P>
<P>
   This was before HBO, VCRs and Blockbuster. The only place to see
a film without commercials was in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   So, I went.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturday Night Fever'' came out in 1977. And ``Annie Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   And ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind.'' And ``Pumping
Iron.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't miss any of them.
</P>
<P>
   I even saw ``The Goodbye Girl,'' although, thinking back, that
might have had something to do with the beautiful, brown-eyed
reporter I'd met at a small paper in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   She was just out of college, too, already a grown-up, already
making sense of the world, and with no need to ``find'' herself, as
she'd never been lost.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the reality of a woman left me with no need to escape into
science fiction. It's difficult to say after all this time.
</P>
<P>
   But the year came and went, and for me no ``Star Wars''.
</P>
<P>
   I remember hearing about the movie, and reading about it, and
seeing reports on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Darth Vader was a bigger bad guy in 1977 than Gary Gilmore, the
convicted murderer whose heart was stopped by firing squad.
</P>
<P>
   The names of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia were in the news
as much as Elvis Presley, whose heart was stopped that year by
fried peanut butter sandwiches and prescripton drugs.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't tell you anything about Han Solo in 1977, but I knew
everything about the three solo home runs Reggie Jackson hit in
successive at-bats in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   By the time ``The Empire Strike Back'' was released in 1980, I'd
begin telling people that I had, in fact, seen ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   `'Loved that R2D2,'' I'd say.
</P>
<P>
   It was easier than trying to explain how I possibly could have
missed the movie. But, with no ``Star Wars'' experience, I was in
no hurry to see ``Empire.'' And never got around to it.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Return of the Jedi'' was a different story.
</P>
<P>
   By 1983, the publicity was overwhelming. What began as an
innocent lapse in my movie-going plans, developed into a solemn
crusade.
</P>
<P>
   I became determined NEVER see any movie in the series, to plant
myself on the shore of American popular culture and not be swept
away by George Lucas's tidal wave.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been easy, over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before ``Return of the Jedi'' was released, the
brown-eyed woman gave birth to our first child. Since then, there's
been another.
</P>
<P>
   Video versions of all three films have found their way into my
living room at one time or another. Most likely rented for the
kids, or carted over by friends.
</P>
<P>
   There was a close call just last summer, when my little boy had
``Star Wars'' in the VCR for nearly 10 minutes, ejecting it only
after I dangled ``Tarzan's New York Adventure'' before his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The monkey beat the robots - for now.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out. The insane hoopla
for ``The Phantom Menace'' has sliced through the American psyche
like a light saber.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the movie, but the toys, the advertising, the
magazine covers, the TV interviews, the previews, the music videos,
the video games, the comic books, the web sites, and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to beat back that kind of assault, even when armed
with classics like ``Captain Blood,'' ``She Wore A Yellow Ribbon,''
``Duck Soup'' and ``The Incredible Mr. Limpet''.
</P>
<P>
   But, I believe someone's got to try. Someone's got to make a
stand. Someone got to look the monster in the eye and say:
</P>
<P>
   The Chewbacca stops here. &QL;

INTEL TOUTS FAST STRONGARM PROCESSOR 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHANDLER, Ariz. - Intel engineers in Chandler are working on the
chip equivalent of a fuel-efficient vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers want handheld computers and other electronics that can
download graphic-rich Web pages, but their energy-guzzling
microprocessors tend to devour battery power.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Intel said Monday that its next generation
StrongARM processor, due out in the second half of next year, will
offer three times the processing speed of its predecessor while
using slightly less power.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the chip can run at lower processing speeds and use as
little as one-tenth the power, explained Jay Heeb, design and
architecture engineer for Intel's next generation of StrongARM.
</P>
<P>
   ``This looks to be pretty impressive,'' said Trevor Yancey, vice
president of technology at the Scottsdale, Ariz., market research
firm IC Insights.
</P>
<P>
   The chip builds on StrongARM technology Intel acquired from
Digital Equipment Corp. in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Intel said the forthcoming StrongARM chip will run at 600
megahertz per second and use a reasonable amount of energy or run
as slow as 150 MHz and use very little energy.
</P>
<P>
   And it can offer a combination of the two.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if the chip is being used in a handheld computer
and the user is downloading a color graphic from the Internet, the
chip will operate at processing speeds of up to 600 megahertz.
After the picture is downloaded and is being viewed, the
microprocessor will operate at a lower speed, saving the battery
power, Heeb said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than dominating the industry, Intel's next StrongARM
processor will compete with chips made by Hitachi, Toshiba and
others. ``They need to make up some market share here,'' said Ken
Dulaney, vice president of the San Jose market research firm Mobile
Computing.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said the next StrongARM appears to have compelling
attributes, namely: ``performance, price and power.''
</P>
<P>
   The processor is designed for devices such as set-top boxes,
handheld computers, Web phones and some Internet products. It's
part of Intel's ongoing efforts to expand beyond its core market of
producing 80 percent of the microprocessors used in the world's
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a smart move on Intel's part, say several analysts who
expect the popularity of handheld devices to boom.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide growth of handheld devices is expected to grow at a
compounded annual rate of 43 percent until 2002, according to
International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   IDC forecasts that by 2002 worldwide shipments of the gadgets
will surpass 25 million units in a market worth more than $13
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Intel's trying to make the most of the market
opportunities,'' said Jill House, a research analyst at IDC. ``They
are better off supporting everything rather than just picking one
pony and betting on it.'' &QL;

 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Anyone perplexed by the time Vice President Al Gore
has devoted recently to traffic jams, car phones and suburban
sprawl should consider this: Fifty years ago fewer than a quarter
of Americans lived in the suburbs. Now half or more do. Every 10
years, another 10 members of Congress represent predominantly
suburban districts.
</P>
<P>
   As the battle for the presidency and control of Congress gets
under way, that growth pattern is having a profound effect on the
language and policy proposals of the parties: from the focus on
education and child-rearing to the interest in controlling sprawl
to a search for ways to appeal to the high-technology workers who
populate the office complexes along suburban beltways.
</P>
<P>
   So Al Gore looks at suburban land use policies. Elizabeth Dole
courts suburban women by braving jeers in New Hampshire to defend
the ban on assault weapons. And Rep. Thomas Davis, the new chairman
of the House Republican re-election effort, looks for candidates
tailored for just such fast-growing areas as his own affluent
Virginia district.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly where the rubber is hitting the road today is the
suburbs,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheer demographics are behind much of the political interest in
the suburbs. To show what the shifting living patterns could mean
to Democrats whose core voters are in the cities, Al From, the head
of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, points to Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   When John F. Kennedy narrowly won the state in 1960, he noted in
an article in The New Democrat, Chicago cast 35 percent of the
Illinois vote. Twenty-six percent came from the suburbs. In 1996
when Bill Clinton was re-elected, the suburbs cast 40 percent of
the state's vote, Chicago only 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electorate of the 21st century,'' From told Democrats in
Idaho recently, ``will be more educated, more affluent, more
suburban, more independent, less unionized _ unless we can turn
that around _ and less urban than the electorate in the 20th
century.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also the case that the political alignment of suburban
voters seems to be shifting. Two decades ago, suburbanites were
considered bedrock Republicans, drawn to the party's message of
lower taxes and fewer handouts for the poor. Now, as suburbs age
and events like the shootings in Littleton, Colo., show that they
are not immune from violence, suburbanites have become more willing
to vote for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton led George Bush in the suburbs in 1992 and made even
stronger inroads in 1996, winning key suburban counties all across
the industrial Midwest and Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Suburbs, of course, range vastly in character from older
communities near the cities to the new strip malls and subdivisions
rising from more distant farm fields. When politicians speak of the
suburbs, they use the phrase as shorthand for key groups of swing
voters: the ``soccer moms'' who were so sought after in the 1996
election; married couples with children; affluent independents; and
the high-technology workers of the information age who populate
office complexes miles from cities.
</P>
<P>
   Linda DiVall, who is the pollster for Mrs. Dole, says the
crucial demographic group is parents who have children under 18
living at home. ``They are a little more Republican than Democrat,
and the candidate that wins this group tends to win the election,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   All this means that politicians are listening closely to voters
like those in Montgomery County, a Republican area outside
Philadelphia that stretches from densely packed brick homes to the
swanky Main Line. The county backed Clinton twice and ousted a
Republican congressman last November in favor of Joe Hoeffel, a
Democratic county commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Hoeffel was sounding out constituents one recent Saturday in
supermarkets when Joyce Wilson accosted him by a vegetable counter
to talk of the shootings at Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this country is just kind of crazy the way it is
handling guns,'' said Ms. Wilson, a pastor's assistant. She also
deplored the growth in the area's Delaware Valley. ``A lot of our
town commissioners are reluctant to stand up against the
builders,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At another supermarket, Lynne Hall, 52, a manager for a medical
office, showed how precarious the Democrats' hold on voters like
her might be. ``I voted for you,'' she shouted to Hoeffel, ``but I
still don't like that president.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Issues like education, transportation and health care have long
been on the national agenda, and they have an appeal stretching
beyond the suburbs. But the focus on the suburbs _ and thus broadly
on middle class families _ has subtly changed how the issues are
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to separate class from geography,'' said Geoffrey
Garin, a Democratic political consultant. ``Think of where the
health care debate has gone. It's not about insuring the uninsured.
It's about HMOs. The debate is about how to treat people who
already have insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   The same is true with education. Once Democrats emphasized
educational programs for poor children and Republicans spoke about
eliminating the Education Department. Now both parties are gearing
the debate toward the interests of middle class families, the
Democrats stressing class size and the Republicans offering tax
credits for parochial and private school tuition.
</P>
<P>
   New this year to the national agenda are issues that appeal
almost entirely to suburbanites. Gore and some Democrats like
Hoeffel are talking of suburban sprawl, traffic congestion and
preservation of open space _ issues that are already playing
prominently in state and local political races.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, there were more than 200 ballot referendums around
the country on maintaining open space. This week, the White House
is sponsoring a National Town Hall meeting on the subject in
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, with Gore at the forefront, has
proposed a $10 billion ``Livability agenda'' that includes tax
credits to support bonding authority for protecting farmland and
cleaning up abandoned industrial space as well as mass transit
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The livability issue is huge here,'' said Hoeffel in his
district office where he used a map of the county to point out
traffic trouble spots and new development. ``The suburban sprawl
that we're experiencing is happening all over the country, and
suburban people are up in arms.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one Republican strategist, Christine Matthews, thinks
her party is underestimating the resonance of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to be empathetic to the fact that people are going a
little crazy,'' she said. ``You're going out and all you see are
these giant Wal-Marts, and they are every few blocks and its not
the kind of environment people want to live in.''

 WASHINGTON: live in.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For both parties the focus on these voting blocs presents
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' problem, political strategists say, is that
many of these voters have been alienated by the religious right. So
it is no coincidence that a number of the leading Republican
presidential candidates are trying to keep an abortion ban far from
the top of the party's agenda in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said his party should reach out to the ``new economy''
workers through free trade policies and legislation sought by the
high-tech industry such as a bill that Democrats blocked in the
Senate last week that would limit lawsuits arising from Year 2000
computer breakdowns. The measure is sharply opposed by trial
lawyers who are among the Democrats' biggest contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of putting up issues like gay rights and abortion that
split our constituencies,'' Davis said, ``let's put up issues that
split labor from the high tech sector, lawyers from high tech.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are trying to emphasize issues that reach their
urban base and suburban voters alike, such as Social Security and
Medicare. But they are also looking to appeal to the values of
suburbanites by stressing children.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking fundamentally about a suburban voter built
around a family-life style,'' said Mark Penn, the pollster for both
Clinton and Gore, ``because people until they have children are
much more likely to live in urban areas and then resettle once they
have children.''
</P>
<P>
   So when Gore talks of reducing traffic, he frames road
congestion as a family issue, speaking of parents ``on the car
phone talking to their kids explaining why they can't get home for
dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   The risk for Democrats is that candidates like George W. Bush or
Elizabeth Dole could draw suburban voters back to their party with
their less strident conservatism. And campaign themes tilted too
much to affluent suburbanites could fail to motivate the party's
labor and liberal base. Bill Bradley, Gore's only rival for the
Democratic nomination, has accused him of focusing on narrow issues
not traditionally the province of the president and promised he
will think bigger.

WAR BRINGS BOOM IN ALBANIAN ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ Like most Albanian men, Dokliat has two guns _
an assault weapon and a pistol _ and he has the critical family and
communist-era secret police connections to back them up. His four
gold rings match his two gleaming bracelets, setting off his
expensive-looking sleek black suit.
</P>
<P>
   A full 24 hours with Dokliat, a professional bodyguard, will
cost you $300, which in edge-of-the-war Albania is a coldly
calculated investment: Travelers to the mafia-controlled north of
the country are almost certain to be robbed by one of the feuding
gangs of the region.
</P>
<P>
   Dokliat brings along hand grenades and other weaponry for the
ride north _ munitions he boasts he's never had to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find a lot of bodyguards in Albania, because everybody
has a gun, so they can say, `I'm a bodyguard,' '' Dokliat said,
waving off the pretend-protectors. But it's Dokliat's school ties
that set him apart; many of the official and unofficial armed men
who stop cars on Albania's poorly constructed roads are his former
classmates at secret police training. ``Everybody knows me,'' he
boasted.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling with its own poverty and lack of development, Albania
has found a boom industry with the arrival of NATO troops and the
threat of a war spilling over its borders.
</P>
<P>
   Students whose parents live on less than $100 a month are making
that in a day, translating for journalists and international
organizations. Families subsisting on two-digit monthly salaries
are camping out in relatives' homes, renting their own apartments
for $100 to $300 a night.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers now charge $200 to $300 to take people north, while a
private helicopter company will take five passengers for $1,200,
saving the passengers six hours in travel time each way. Bodyguards
charge $100 to $300 daily, not including a car.
</P>
<P>
   Not that getting a car is a problem. Albania is Europe's poorest
nation, with virtually no functioning legitimate economy and a
third-world infrastructure. But buying a late-model Mercedes-Benz,
BMW, or Jeep Grand Cherokee is a breeze at the makeshift vehicle
sales lot on Albania's western coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are thief cars,'' said a man in the lot who described
himself as a professional driver. Asked the fee for a Volkswagen
Golf, the man said, ``You want one? I go to Germany tomorrow. No
problem. I bring it for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The hundreds of vehicles on the lot indeed look suspicious, with
their Italian, German, and Swiss license plates still screwed on.
Cars ``with documents'' cost more, one salesman said, and the
others ``can't go out of Albania.''
</P>
<P>
   The stretch of road where the car lot is located defines
Albania, a throwback nation in the heart of modern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   There is the suspect car lot full of luxury vehicles, on a road
so beat up the cars won't last long if driven on them. The white
stucco houses on the hill across the street are barely standing,
and are too small for the shoeless children and weathered-looking
adults who inhabit them.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately next door to the car lot is the headquarters for
Albania Force, a humanitarian branch of the NATO operation against
Yugoslavia. The base, too, sits on the Adriatic sea, a beach that
could be a world-class resort if the Albanian government had the
means to clean up the sewage.
</P>
<P>
   The whole country has a feeling of being occupied. The roads are
taken up by aid trucks and huge vehicles carting heavy weaponry.
NATO soldiers cruise around the streets in green military vehicles,
and have virtually taken over the Rinas airport area.
</P>
<P>
   Long isolated, poor, and malfunctioning, Albania may find its
most promising role yet as that of the potential staging ground for
a NATO assault on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albanians, even though they feel really bad about what's
happening, still feel the beginning of a new era for Albania,''
said Dashi Peza, a businessman whose translation, logistics, and
hotel services are currently overbooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think the presence of NATO will be very productive. For
some Albanians, this period of war has been very beneficial,'' Peza
said.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits, however, have largely gone through the black
economy, or what Arben Malaj, a member of Parliament and former
finance minister, calls ``the informal economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The cash-strapped Albanian government, already saddled with the
most severe economic and developmental troubles in the region,
still is not being reimbursed adequately for its housing of Kosovar
refugees, Malaj said.
</P>
<P>
   Malaj estimated that the refugees will cost the Albanian
government $200 million if the crisis lasts the year; just $100
million in direct aid has been promised. The impact of the refugees
on the education, health, water, and energy systems is also heavy,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of NATO, and the potential improvement of the
infrastructure that may come with a long-term stay by the troops,
``will be, I guess, exploited for good,'' Malaj said.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors, always skittish about putting money into
unstable Albania, were scared off completely after the disastrous
pyramid schemes of 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every Albanian family sank all their money into the
phony get-rich-quick schemes, and most lost everything. The crisis
led to mass riots and the looting of Albania's military arsenals
for weaponry _ munitions that have made for a well-armed populace.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Albania is still ``a mess,'' Peza said.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption is an accepted condition here. Locals say a job
working as a customs officer goes for as much as $18,000. That's
not the salary, they say; that's the price an Albanian has to pay
as a bribe to get the job, on the presumption that the employee
will make that much and more by demanding fees from people bringing
things into Albania.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of money changing hands in Albania, but few people
seem to be actually working. Illegal money-changers flap their wads
of local lek at passersby on Skanderbeg Square, right under the
eyes of local police.
</P>
<P>
   Fake visas to Greece, where an estimated 300,000 Albanians go to
find under-the-table work _ go for $300 to $800, locals say,
leaving little incentive for the buyer or seller to earn money
legitimately in Albania, where the average monthly income is $106.
</P>
<P>
   Armed banditry in the north is common; an AP television crew,
robbed of $250,000 in cash, equipment, and vehicles, was offered it
back _ for $28,000.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny Western Union office downtown has a guard outside
controlling the crush of people who go there every business day to
collect money. Nearly every Albanian family has at least one family
member working abroad and wiring money home, said economist Fatmir
Mema _ one explanation of how Albanians are able to eat, when
unemployment is 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's presence may bring cash, international attention, and
some sense of order to Albania, some here say, improvements that
could help make the tiny nation more like its European neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   But the initial benefit may well be worse in the long term for
Albania, which needs to shed its dependency economy and develop on
its own, Mema said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, NATO's presence is positive. In other ways, it
is a disaster,'' Mema said. ``Albania needs work and investments _
not aid. The destiny of Albania is not now in the hands of
Albanians.''

GLOBE NAMES HANAFIN EDITORIAL DIRECTOR OF ON-LINE ARM 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Teresa Hanafin, assistant managing editor for
technology at The Boston Globe, has been named editorial director
of the newspaper's Web site, Boston.com, Globe officials said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hanafin, 43, will continue to manage computer-assisted reporting
projects for the newspaper. The new slot will give her the
additional responsibility of directing content strategy for
Boston.com, one of the nation's leading newspaper Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teresa's distinguished news career coupled with her
technological skills and interests make her an excellent and
obvious choice for this job,'' said Globe editor Matthew V. Storin.
</P>
<P>
   In her 14-year career at the Globe, Hanafin has covered state
politics, development, and Cape Cod. She worked for two years as
assistant business editor and went on to be deputy city editor and
city editor. In March, she ended a two-and-a-half-year tenure as
the paper's metro editor. Under her leadership, the metro staff won
several national journalism prizes, including the George Polk
Award, the Investigative Reporters and Editors Award, and the
Headliners Award.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Millstein, Boston.com's chief executive, said Hanafin's
selection is ``consistent with our desire to integrate more of what
we do on Boston.com with the interests of the Globe newspaper.''
The Web site, launched in October 1995, recorded 29.2 million page
views in March.

EX-TEACHER, FRIEND GO ON TRIAL FOR DRUG SMUGGLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZEKE MacCORMACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A former high school teacher and her boyfriend
went on trial in federal court here Monday, accused of recruiting
teen-agers to drive carloads of marijuana from Mexico into Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme let Juan Galan and Rebecca Besa reap the financial
rewards of smuggling drugs while minimizing their risk of arrest,
Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Ried said in opening arguments.
</P>
<P>
   But defense lawyers cast their clients as undeserving casualties
of America's overzealous war on drugs. They called on the jury to
be wary of convicted smugglers who would appear as ``patriot
witnesses'' for the government under grants of immunity or with
deals to reduce their sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are criminals, except all of a sudden when they
join the other side, they're patriot witnesses,'' said Alan Brown,
who represents Besa.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old former English teacher at Eagle Pass High School
wiped her eyes and shook her head from side to side as the
allegations were laid out before U.S. District Judge Fred Biery.
</P>
<P>
   Eagle Pass is about 140 miles west of here and is across the Rio
Grande from Piedras Negras, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Ried said evidence against the couple would include receipts
showing Besa rented cars used by the smugglers and hotel rooms
where they stayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knew very well everything that her boyfriend did,'' Ried
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown said Besa's only interest in Galan was romantic, and
that she thought he was working as a government informer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence will show that she was used by Mr. Juan Galan,
because she was in love with him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Galan, a 26 year-old Mexican national portrayed by prosecutors
as a drug-dealing playboy, listened to the translation of court
proceedings Monday with no obvious signs of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Alex Scharff conceded that Galan is no angel, but
he said his client isn't a drug kingpin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an ordinary guy who did some things that were wrong,''
Scharff said.
</P>
<P>
   Both defendants are charged with conspiring to possess marijuana
with the intent to distribute, and employing people under 18 in a
drug transaction. Galan also is charged with operating a continuing
criminal enterprise and illegal possession of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   To convict him on the criminal enterprise charge, known as ``the
kingpin statute,'' the government must prove Galan supervised five
or more people in the criminal enterprise, that it involved three
or more criminal acts, and that it generated a substantial amount
of money.
</P>
<P>
   Ried said that between 1993 and 1998, Galan directed smugglers
carrying from 50 to 800 pounds of pot at a time, from Piedras
Negras to San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The couple moved from Eagle Pass to San Antonio in 1998 and, at
the time of their arrest in November, $47,000 in cash was found in
their apartment, Ried said.
</P>
<P>
   A search of Galan's mother's home in Eagle Pass uncovered three
guns, which Galan was prohibited from owning because he is an
illegal immigrant.

TOP-SECRET BOMB BELIEVED USED TO BLACK OUT YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The top-secret weapon that zapped a large part of Yugoslavia's
electrical power supply was a ``soft bomb'' first used in the Gulf
War. The high-tech weapon was developed by the Navy after a
training mission accidentally blacked out a portion of Southern
California, defense analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials refused to comment Monday on the bomb that
sprayed graphite over the power station and shorted its circuits,
though they were clearly pleased at its apparent ability to turn
out the lights in Belgrade virtually at will.
</P>
<P>
   The weapon was targeted at the large, open-air switching yards
that connect electrical power plants to the grid of power
distribution lines that serve large areas through substations and
individual electric lines, said John Pike, an analyst for the
Federation of American Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb can be delivered either by cruise missiles or aircraft,
but NATO wouldn't even say how the devices got to their targets
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   When the bomb is detonated in the air over the electrical
facility, the explosion hurls a number of smaller ``bomblets'' that
in turn spew many spools of graphite thread into the air. Graphite
is a good conductor of electricity, and when the threads fall onto
the electrical wires of the switching stations, they short-circuit
the power lines and send huge surges of electricity through the
entire power grid, said Pike.
</P>
<P>
   Pike compared the effect to that of sticking a fork into a
toaster. ``It not only blows out the toaster, but trips the circuit
breaker in the house,'' he said. The bomb ``is going to damage or
destroy some of the hardware in the switchyard itself, and put a
surge through the grid and trip out a lot of the substations,'' he
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the strikes knocked out power to about 70 percent
of Serbia for about seven hours overnight. Department of Defense
spokesman Kenneth Bacon, refused to speak about the bomb, which he
said is ``highly classified,'' but mentioned that one goal of using
it was that it ``disorients and confuses their computers by
shutting them off quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   This strategy first appeared in the Gulf War, when similar
bombs, known as KIT-18s, were used to attack power stations around
Baghdad, said Pike. They contained flexible metal strips instead of
graphite fibers.
</P>
<P>
   In their 1995 book, ``The General's War: The Inside Story of the
Conflict in the Gulf,'' Michael Gordon and Bernard Trainor say the
idea for the bomb grew out of a training accident in Southern
California. Aircraft were dropping ``chaff,'' hundreds of metallic
strips long used to confuse enemy radar, when a bunch of it fell
onto a power switching station and blacked out a large area of
Orange County,'' the book says.
</P>
<P>
   In a flash of inspiration, someone in the Navy saw the makings
of a new weapon, which is now enabling NATO to put ``its finger on
the light switch in Yugoslavia,'' as NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said
Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PEC, Yugoslavia _ Silvia Buzshila, just 16, sat huddled and
shivering on the ground by the bus station in this Kosovo city,
surrounded by her family and about 35 other Albanians _ surrounded
but utterly lost.
</P>
<P>
   Threatened by Serbs and bombed by NATO again Monday for the
second time in four days, Miss Buzshila had absolutely no idea
where to find safety, or even a bed for the night in Pec. In a city
of 70,000 before the Serbian rampage began, looted Albanian shops
now gape emptily and the smoke from burning Albanian houses still
rises thickly in the air, already heavy with rage and fear.
</P>
<P>
   A drive here from Belgrade, Serbia's capital, revealed an eerie,
other-worldly place, full of blood and blood oaths, of houses
licked by flame and others painted with Serbian slogans and symbols
to protect them from the fiery fate of Albanian properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid of the bombing. I'm afraid of everything,'' Miss
Buzshila said. ``Where are we supposed to go?''
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Djemail, 56, did not understand his daughter's
English, but he heard her tone, and he began to sob.
</P>
<P>
   Only 18 miles from here, a NATO warplane rocketed and strafed a
bus and some cars at a police checkpoint Monday, high in the
soul-stirring mountains that lead to Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials who accompanied reporters to the scene of the
bombing Monday said that at least 17 people were killed and 40
wounded. The scene was horrific in the increasingly familiar way in
which frail human bodies are ripped apart by explosive blast and
steel.
</P>
<P>
   A bureaucratic paper giving Zoran Mihajlovic the right to get
gasoline for his white Ford Sierra, plate DJ 173-70, from April 29
to May 3 to secure food for his restaurant, lay soaked in his blood
by his car. His Ford was holed with shrapnel, its glass burst, its
white paint burned away.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard enough for reporters who arrived after the event.
They noted the smear of blood by the woman's black-strapped shoe;
the two blasted civilian cars and two police cars; the buzzing
flies; the scraps of flesh; the unexploded cluster bombs; the
meager belongings in the rice-bag suitcases of the refugees and
travelers, still crammed into the shattered bus, its faded blue
polyester curtains ragged from broken glass and shrapnel.
</P>
<P>
   But Miss Buzshila and her family were there when it happened
Monday, at about 2 p.m., in a second bus behind the first, trying
to flee to Montenegro. Asked what she saw, she cupped her hands to
her face, covering her eyes and twisting her head violently away.
</P>
<P>
   The Buzshila family is from Prizren, the lovely old Turkish town
deep in southern Kosovo where ethnic groups had lived peacefully
together. Four days ago, while the Serbs intensified their
expulsions of Albanians from Prizren and NATO intensified its air
campaign, a bomb fell on a house just behind theirs, and the
Buzshilas decided to flee.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the Serbs so much, she said in English _ unprompted
and untranslated _ that set the family to flight. It was the bomb
that made life in Kosovo seem impossible. That she should have been
where a bomb fell again Monday seemed so utterly implausible that
even she could not take it in.
</P>
<P>
   NATO denies that its bombs cause anyone to flee, but that is a
dubious notion to anyone who has had one land nearby, when it feels
as if one's head is coming off and one's stomach is so clenched it
strains a muscle.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs deny that there is any organized effort to expel
Albanians from Kosovo. That is an even more ludicrous notion to
anyone who has seen the hundreds of shelled and burned houses, the
empty villages in the Kosovo countryside, the wandering farm
animals, the starving horses and wild packs of dogs, the empty
cities and echoing streets, the looted stores and ruined mosques,
with Christian crosses spray-painted on them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As Miss Buzshila spoke, a young Serbian man with a short beard
rushed up, also speaking English. ``Don't listen to these Albanian
lies!'' he shouted. ``We've done nothing to these people!'' He
spat. ``You all write lies! Did you see that bus? That's a real
crime! You go and just write more lies while we go home and wait
for the bombs _ and for what? For nothing!''
</P>
<P>
   Others gathered and began to push and shout.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Buzshila retreated, cowering into her father and the other
Albanians, who pressed themselves against a low stone wall, waiting
for a bus to anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   All over Pec, houses and shops stand burned or labeled. Many are
marked with the Serbian symbol, a cross with a Cyrillic ``C'' _ the
Latin ``S'' _ in each quadrant. Some have the word ``Serbia''
spray-painted on, or display the Serbian flag. One house was marked
``JUL'' on its windows, the abbreviation for the Yugoslav United
Left party of President Slobodan Milosevic's wife, Mirjana
Markovic.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those spared had the Serbian cross and the word Romi, in
both Latin and Cyrillic, to indicate the owner is a Gypsy, or the
words, Romska Kuca _ Gypsy house.
</P>
<P>
   Decaying bodies of animals line the sides of the roads, dead
from starvation or lack of care or the crazed speed at which people
drive, as if they can outrun the airplanes or somehow cheat the
bomb aimed for the bridge. That also applies to the the buses, many
of which do contain policemen or soldiers. But some contain
ordinary people terrified for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   On the road from Pristina to Pec, a huge crater suddenly
appeared Monday, still smoking and seeming to cause the reddish
clay-like earth to bubble up. But there was already the beginnings
of a muddy, dirt-path detour through the empty, burned-out villages
where cows wander and chew on wood, and others lie bloated and dead
in courtyards, unburned and unburied, left for the maggots and
flies.
</P>
<P>
   At one such place, in a tiny Albanian village where the road
runs narrowly between woven branch hedge rows, there was suddenly a
checkpoint and a roadblock, and a single soldier, surprised by the
traffic, barring the way.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps what lay down that road was just another deployment of
soldiers living in small groups in abandoned houses, ready to try
to hold the ground if NATO troops should come. Or perhaps it was
another crater making even this path impassible.
</P>
<P>
   But the smell of corruption there was overwhelming. Perhaps what
was down that road was the kind of atrocity that the refugees
assert, NATO decries and the Serbs deny. Under Yugoslav army
escort, dangerous enough these days in Kosovo, it was impossible to
do other than to turn around.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a large, three-story house of white brick, set with
charm by a brook, was burning brightly, the flames cracking the
window glass and pale grey smoke moving up through the red-orange
roof tiles.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping for a moment to watch the collapse of a grandiose set
of dreams, the army escort said: ``Don't assume. I think it is just
one disappointed soul, who shut the door and said goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   But from the high switchbacks that mark the road between Pec and
Podgorica, one could see miles into the green valley that spread
out below. There were at least 10 billowing pillars of new smoke,
and hundreds of houses already burned, and the big cracking sounds
of NATO planes launching new attacks from the clear spring air, far
above the human wretchedness of Kosovo.

COLUMBINE STUDENTS WELCOMED AT DIFFERENT SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ In October, they came together for the
homecoming football game, and Columbine High School won. In April,
they came together for the funerals, and Columbine lost, so much,
so many.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Columbine and Chatfield senior high schools came
together yet again, neither as rivals nor as mourners, but as
partners in helping Columbine students to reclaim their lives as
normal teenagers for whom school is a place to learn, not to flee.
</P>
<P>
   With donated books and supplies _ their own backpacks were left
behind in the mad dash from the school _ most of the 1,960
Columbine students returned to classes 13 days after the massacre.
Attendance was 94 percent, school officials said, slightly above
normal.
</P>
<P>
   They came to Chatfield, nestled in the foothills of the Rocky
Mountains and just four miles from Columbine, because their school
remains a cordoned-off crime scene with bullet-pocked walls, broken
windows, and the ghosts of their innocence. It will not reopen
until September at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Once the students made it through a heavy ring of security, they
were greeted by Chatfield not as survivors of a slaughter or
crosstown competitors, but as friends and neighbors in this Denver
suburb of 35,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   A huge banner, ``Welcome Columbine,'' hung from the school
entrance. Another banner used the two schools' colors _ blue and
burgundy _ to form a heart, under which was written, ``We are
one.'' It was a change from their traditional bleacher chants of
``We are Columbine'' versus ``We are Chatfield.'' Inside, they were
still Columbine Rebels, and their hosts were still Chatfield
Chargers, but that seemed irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter that we're going to Chatfield. What matters
is that we're all going to be together, and we're all going to get
back to normal,'' said Sean Corkery, 16, a sophomore. His freshman
typing teacher, William ``Dave'' Sanders, was the only adult
killed. Fourteen students died, including the two gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Havilane, 16, a junior, said she wished she was
returning to Columbine, but was looking forward to being back in
school. ``I don't think we're ever going to be done mourning, but
everyone needs to smile the same amount as they cry,'' said
Havilane, who ran from the cafeteria when the shootings began.
</P>
<P>
   On her way home, senior Mandy Dugan, 18, said the day was
``really uplifting, not like the crying of all the memorials and
the funerals. We spent a lot of time clapping for our teachers and
thanking them.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all Columbine students were as welcome as others. School
officials said they called eight to 10 ``friends and
acquaintances'' of gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold and asked
if they would prefer not to attend Chatfield. School department
spokesman Rick Kaufman said several declined the offer and came to
Chatfield, while others accepted home tutoring or other
``alternative'' educational options. He would not identify the
students.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman said the offer was made ``in the best interests of those
students as well as other students.'' He said the list was drawn up
in consultation with the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department.
Sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said those students were considered
witnesses, not suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman said school officials also informed all Columbine
students that trench coats were banned from school property.
Klebold and Harris were members of a group of outcasts known as the
``Trench Coat Mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   The preferred dress code was a white T-shirt with blue and
burgundy hands clasped together in celebration of the schools'
unification. Students also received heart-shaped lapel ribbons, in
burgundy intertwined with blue, to honor the murder victims and 23
wounded students, five of whom remained hospitalized. The Chatfield
neighborhood did its part as well, decorating trees, homes and
street signs with balloons, posters, flowers and ribbons.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate roughly 4,000 students in a school built for half
as many, Chatfield students will attend classes in the mornings,
and Columbine students will take their places from 12:50 p.m. to 6
p.m. The split shifts will only last a short time because school
ends May 27. Columbine's graduation will take place as scheduled
May 22.
</P>
<P>
   Counselors warned that some, perhaps many, Columbine students
will continue to suffer for months or years. Grades will drop,
anxieties will rise, behavior will change, nightmares will haunt,
and hearts will harden, they said. But at least outwardly,
Columbine students streaming into their temporary new school seemed
indistinguishable from Chatfield students who were leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's school day began with the ``National Anthem'' and a
one-hour assembly. Then there were ``debriefing'' sessions in which
students assembled in groups of six to discuss their feelings. Each
student was given two minutes; whenever a student chose not to
speak, there was a two-minute silence. Students then spent 15
minutes in each of their classes, mostly to get a sense of where
they were expected to be.
</P>
<P>
   Some teachers said they planned to use that brief time to
continue the healing and restart the learning.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Samson, an advanced placement English teacher, said she
would give each of her 90 students a polished rock and a poem by
Charles Simic called ``Stone.'' Two lines of the poem read: ``So
perhaps it is not dark inside after all. Perhaps there is a moon
shining from somewhere, as though behind a hill _ just enough light
to make out the strange writing, the star charts on the inner
wall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to learn to focus and find stillness and get on with
what we have to do,'' said Samson, whose students included senior
Lauren Townsend, a candidate for valedictorian who was killed in
the rampage. ``I think it will be like trying to conduct a
symphony. We'll have to understand what all the different pieces
do, and then bring them together.''
</P>
<P>
   The school also set up several ``safe rooms'' where students and
teachers could seek time alone or a meeting with one of several
dozen counselors.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman said among the teachers in attendance Monday was Peggy
Nielsen, whose terror-struck voice was heard on a tape of a 911
telephone call made just before 10 students and the gunmen died in
the school library. She has declined to discuss her ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   On their way in and out of Chatfield's main entrance Monday,
Columbine students could not help but see a gray stone monument
placed by Chatfield parents. It was inscribed with a message: ``To
Columbine _ We open our doors so you may continue to learn. We open
our hearts so that together we may heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Chisled into the top corner of the stone was a delicate
blue-and-white flower. It was a columbine, a perennial that will
bloom again this month.

COMMERCE CHIEF BRINGS NAFTA MESSAGE TO TEXTILE PLANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saying his goal is to promote free trade, US Secretary of
Commerce William Daley visited a Fall River textile plant Monday
and met with business leaders while angry union members stood
outside questioning the free trade policy that has cost them their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The tour, part of the first leg of Daley's national trade
initiative ``The National Trade Education Tour,'' began at the
World Trade Center in Boston, where the trade secretary met with
several business and political leaders. They included US Senator
Edward M. Kennedy; David Weinstein, chief of environment and
government affairs at Fidelity Investments; and Ann Finucane, chair
of the New England Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``America's prosperity in the years to come will depend on how
well our companies and our workers are able to compete in the world
economy,'' Daley told the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want every man, woman, and child in America to understand
that trade matters,'' he said. ``We want to hear their views and
come up with a new approach on trade that ensures that the maximum
number of Americans benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Daley urged business leaders to do all they could to
support free trade, union leaders argued that the North American
Free Trade Agreement has helped destroy the nation's ailing
manufacturing sector and has stripped many US workers of viable
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I applaud you for saying we need to have a dialogue,'' AFL-CIO
president Robert Haynes said. ``I agree that the American public
needs to be educated about trade, but I also believe that you and
the president need to be educated about the insecurity of the
American worker.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Daley and his entourage toured Quaker Fabrics, a
Fall River manufacturer of upholstery fabric whose work force has
increased to 2,400 from just over 1,000 five years ago. The company
was selected for the tour by the US Department of Commerce because
it has succeeded in a region where many textile manufacturers have
shutdown or moved operations overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kelly, a credit manager at Quaker Fabrics, said the
company expects between $250 million and $280 million in sales this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We chose Quaker Fabrics because we felt people in Fall River
need to see the positive (aspects of free trade),'' Daley said in
an interview after the plant tour. ``There is no question that
there have been job dislocations over the last decade, not just
because of trade but also because of technological change. No trade
agreement is all good or all bad. The key is to keep things
balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the office of the Union of Needletrade Industrial and
Technical Employees (UNITE), many workers said it would take more
jobs rather than a national tour to convince them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want free trade. We want fair trade,'' said Claire
Francoeur, a 35-year-old curtain maker who was born and raised in
Fall River. ``We can't compete with foreign wages that are $1 an
hour or less.''

AOL DEFECTION CASTS DOUBT ON BID FOR MEDIONE GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The chances are diminishing that a partnership between
Comcast Corp. and two leading technology companies will outbid AT&AMP;T
Corp. to acquire MediaOne Group, the nation's fourth largest cable
television provider.
</P>
<P>
   America Online Inc. Monday reportedly dropped out of a hastily
formed financial arrangement with Comcast and Microsoft Corp. to
acquire MediaOne, whose largest market for cable TV and high speed
Internet service is Massachussetts.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne has touched off one of the highest profile bidding wars
on Wall Street in years. The Colorado-based company's extensive
cable network is coveted by major corporations seeking to offer
high-speed Internet access, local phone service and enhanced
entertainment services.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Philadelphia-based Comcast, the nation's third
largest cable company, unveiled a $48 billion agreement to acquire
MediaOne only to have AT&AMP;T make a $54 billion unsolicited
counteroffer in late April.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, MediaOne's board of directors agreed to accept
the AT&AMP;T offer of stock and cash. They abandoned Comcast's offer of
stock only, and gave it until Thursday to come up with a higher
bid.
</P>
<P>
   Both AOL, based in Dulles, Va. and Microsoft of Redmond, Wash.
have expressed interest in helping Comcast make a new bid. Last
week, AOL and Microsoft signed ``confidentiality'' agreements with
MediaOne, the first step in merger talks.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL has dropped out, a decision first reported by CNBC
Monday afternoon. ``If AOL backs out, I think the probablility that
Comcast can come back with a higher offer is lower than it was last
Friday,'' said Thomas Egan, senior cable and satellite analyst at
PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne shares Monday fell 1 3/4 to 79 7/8 while AT&AMP;T stock
rose 5/8 to 51 1/8. Comcast stock climbed 3 1/16 to 65 15/16 while
Microsoft shares fell 1 9/16 to 79 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   An AOL spokeswoman declined to comment on the CNBC report that
cited unidentified people close to the Internet service company.
CNBC reported that AOL was deterred by the financial demands of
partnering with Comcast.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Microsoft or AT&AMP;T, AOL does not have substantial cash to
back a high-priced acquistion of MediaOne, according to several
Wall Street analysts. However, AOL wants to crack the high speed
Internet access market over cable wires, since it is losing
customers to MediaOne and other cable providers. About 50 percent
of AOL's customers use relatively slow dial-up modems to access the
World Wide Web and cable provides an attractive, faster
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL has the strategic reasons for getting closer to the cable
industry, but it lacks the cash, while Microsoft has the money, but
not the same critical need to get close to the major cable
players,'' said Gary Farber, an analyst at SG Cowen &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft declined to comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Even without AOL, Comcast may still find the cash it needs.
Microsoft cofounder and billionaire Paul Allen, who controls
Charter Communications Corp., the nation's sixth largest cable
television operator, is reportedly talking with Comcast.

   KUKES, Albania _ The butt end of a Serbian rifle left the
refugee's eyes swollen shut. In a crowded storage closet that is
now his examining room, Dr. James Desmoore found that the man was
bleeding from the gash on the bridge of his nose, and that his
cheek, his forehead and perhaps the back of his skull had probably
been fractured by the beating.
</P>
<P>
   Above the noise and confusion caused by the 10 refugees who had
helped the man walk the last five miles to the border, and who had
then brought him to the examining room, Desmoore knew he needed
X-rays, some tranquilizers and a hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
   All he could do, however, was clean the wounds and give the man
aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' Desmoore said as the man lay on the
examining table, ``because we can't do what we know we should do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lack of medicine, scarcity of equipment, resistance from local
doctors and an unending stream of needy refugees combine to make
this refugee frontier a test of humanitarian resolve and medical
ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   With perhaps 100,000 desperate refugees in and around this
crumbling city, just 10 miles from the Yugoslav border in Albania's
remote north, providing even the most basic medical attention has
become a pressing and almost unmeetable need.
</P>
<P>
   Desmoore and about 30 other doctors from half a dozen relief
organizations here know they are tiptoeing around the edge of a
catastrophe as they try to treat the worst cases with the bare
minimum of supplies that have arrived here so far.
</P>
<P>
   They are thankful for small blessings, like the continued cold
temperatures that have suppressed the breeding of flies and
mosquitoes and thus prevented epidemics that are spread by insects.
But the chilly dampness has also led to an outbreak of respiratory
infections that can easily turn into pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors see scabies, and broken bones, and shrapnel wounds.
But worst of all, they say, are the lingering effects of the
violence and hatred of this particular war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids won't talk, the old people can't sleep, nobody can
eat,'' said Desmoore, who previously volunteered to work in other
refugee crises, including Rwanda. ``I've never seen people this
traumatized by war.''
</P>
<P>
   The local people call Desmoore, who is originally from Decatur,
Ala., Dr. Jim, and while language is something of a barrier in his
examining room, they entrust themselves to the hulking American,
who does not wear a traditional white coat because there is none
here to fit him.
</P>
<P>
   Skender Vehapi brought his 6-year-old son, Mentor, to Desmoore
because he was listless and weak, coughing so hard that his face
turned red and he refused to eat. They had spent nearly a week on
the road after being driven from their homes in Zatric, in
southwest Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   After examining the boy, Desmoore said that he had a fever and
the flu, but that what was really causing his condition was the
trauma of what he had been through. This suppressed his appetite,
making him weak and susceptible to infection.
</P>
<P>
   But Desmoore has no sedatives or tranquilizers to calm these
terrorized people so they can sleep, or eat without vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   After his son was examined, Vehapi reluctantly asked the doctor
to check him, too. He was also run down, and had tonsillitis and
other infections. Desmoore prescribed antibiotics, which were
supplied by a pharmacy in the clinic, and told the man to take tea
with lemon.
</P>
<P>
   Vehapi thanked the doctor and left. Outside, he said he did not
have money to buy tea.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 400,000 refugees have entered Albania from Kosovo, most
of them passing through or settling temporarily in this city.
Slowly, a medical infrastructure has emerged. Organizations like
Doctors Without Borders, Doctors of the World, the Red Cross, the
United Nations and the International Medical Corps are here, and
Unicef is to bring in about 70 doctors and medical assistants.
</P>
<P>
   The teams have been helping refugees in camps and the unofficial
refugee centers established by the refugees themselves in whatever
flat, open area they could find.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is quite stable now,'' said Francis Tyler,
program coordinator for the International Medical Corps, an
organization of doctors that has its headquarters in Los Angeles.
``But there still are a lot of special cases.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL MATERIAL)
</P>
<P>
   In particular, he said, it has been difficult to provide
specialized medicine for those with chronic diseases. One family
came to Desmoore in search of medicine for an inhaler used by a
woman with asthma. It was not available, but Desmoore and the
Kosovar pharmacist working at the Kukes clinic devised a substitute
using three medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, which
has a recruitment and training camp here, sometimes comes in and
demands medical supplies. ``They have guns,'' Desmoore said, ``so
we give them what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Some medical supplies sent to Albania have been held up or
confiscated by customs officers. In some instances, relief
organizations have had to pay outlandish sums to rescue the
supplies. In other cases, the medicine just disappears, probably to
resurface on the black market.
</P>
<P>
   Even a big step forward does not always bring the clinic any
closer to easing the problems. A British charity recently delivered
a complete mobile surgical unit with sophisticated examining
equipment. But it sits unused because it is powered by a portable
generator that runs on unleaded gasoline, which is not sold in
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Desmoore has spent his entire career working with
underprivileged people, first with the Peace Corps and later with
other organizations. Part Scot and part Cherokee, Desmoore is a
Vietnam veteran who admits he just does not fit into the American
medical establishment. He keeps his long hair in a tight pony tail
and carries around a bag of colored candy that he uses to calm the
children he treats.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL MATERIAL)
</P>
<P>
   Desmoore, 47, showed up in Albania last month from Egypt, where
he now lives and works with an organization called Sinai Support
Systems. The group provides medical care for desert Bedouins, and
veterinary care for their camels.
</P>
<P>
   When they arrived in Albania, Desmoore and two medical
assistants, Lars Anderson and Chris Donovan, were carrying about
240 pounds of medical supplies in their backpacks, which they had
decided to deliver themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Desmoore volunteered to work and was immediately assigned to
examine and treat people as soon as they crossed the border. He saw
thousands of refugees, including the survivors of a family whose
car ran over an anti-tank mine at the border.
</P>
<P>
   When the flow slowed this week, Desmoore was asked by the
International Medical Corps to set up an examining room in an
Albanian clinic that could serve all the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got here, this place was just filled with junk that we
had to shovel out,'' he said. An examining table and a desk were
brought in, and a sparsely filled medicine cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day, he arrived shortly after 8 a.m. to find the
hallway dark because light bulbs had been stolen. The sink was
overflowing.
</P>
<P>
   During the course of 10 hours, during which the rain and the
clamor never stopped, 163 refugees came to Desmoore's tiny office.
By the end of the day, one bulb had been replaced,
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all, a light day,'' he said, ``comparatively
speaking.''

MARKET PLACE: PARTY TIME AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Dow Jones industrial average blew past the 11,000
mark on Monday, just 24 trading days after it topped 10,000 for the
first time. The Dow average closed the day at 11,014.69, up 225.65
points.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 percent move from March 29 to May 3 was not the fastest
such rise in market history. But it was the quickest jump of 10
percent to come during a period of prolonged market strength. Moves
of this magnitude and speed have historically followed weakness in
the Dow, during the 1930s for example, or after the crash of 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Wowed investors had barely swept up the last of the confetti
from their Dow 10,000 bashes when party time descended again late
Monday. Even though the Dow, composed of only 30 blue-chip stocks,
is the narrowest of the market's well-known indicators, investment
strategists noted that its latest move was indeed cause for
celebration because it was built on a much broader base than had
characterized the market in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   While the assault on Dow 10,000 was led by a narrow band of
favored stocks like Microsoft, Dell Computer, Cisco Systems and
General Electric, the upward action in April and on Monday included
a much broader group of stocks, including companies in unglamorous
industries like electric utilities, paper products, railroads and
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market had been dominated for a number of months by a
fairly elite group of large-capitalization growth stocks,''
explained A. Marshall Acuff, equity strategist at Salomon Smith
Barney. ``But while increasing numbers of those stocks were showing
diminishing returns, the cyclical and smaller stocks were
extraordinarily cheap. Their coming along has created a more
egalitarian market.''
</P>
<P>
   In what was an extraordinary shift in investor sentiment, the
stocks that had been beloved started to look pricey while the
former dogs looked swell. Behind the change was investors' growing
perception that economic growth around the world was rebounding and
that even the lowliest of manufacturing companies would participate
in the recovery. Since many of these companies' stocks were trading
big discounts to the favorites, they looked like values.
</P>
<P>
   The awakening among stocks that had been comatose for months, if
not longer, means that investors who had been sidelined from the
market's action since last October when stocks shook off global
economic woes are participating once again. According to Salomon
Smith Barney, in early April, 80.8 percent of U.S. stocks lagged
the performance of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index by 15 percent or
more; at the end of the month, that number had dwindled to 77.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But not all are winners in following this change in market
leadership. The former darlings and the indexes they dominate are
being punished by the shift. Dell is down 22.5 percent from its
February high, Microsoft has lost almost 16 percent from its April
peak and General Electric is down 9.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Because stocks in the S&AMP;P 500 index are weighted not equally but
by their market values, the recent declines among these companies
is limiting the index's return as well as those of millions of
investors in mutual funds that mirror the S&AMP;P's moves. The S&AMP;P 500
rose 1.46 percent on Monday, but is up only 10.2 percent for the
year to the Dow's 19.97 percent jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really had three markets,'' said Thomas O'Neill, chief
investment officer at Fleet Financial Group in Boston. ``We've had
an Internet mania unlike any mania I've ever seen. Then you have
the mega-capitalization momentum stocks whose valuations are very
extreme relative to their earnings growth rates. Then the rest of
the market, the vast majority of stocks, have been down on average
15 percent from their highs.''
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. Stocks that led the Dow Jones above 11,000 Monday
included Minnesota Mining &AMP; Manufacturing, which has risen 33
percent in a month; Goodyear Tire, which is up 21.5 percent, and
Allied Signal, with a 24 percent gain. Even staid electric utility
stocks rose, pushing the Dow Jones utility index up 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What is remarkable about this broadening of the market is that
it is happening during an upswing in stock prices. Extreme shifts
in investor sentiment, like this one, usually occur during
declining markets.

JACKSON A MASTER OF `THIRD PARTY' DIPLOMACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN YEMMA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the runway at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland Monday
afternoon, you could watch jetliners carrying free-lance negotiator
Rev. Jesse L. Jackson and shuttle diplomat Viktor S. Chernomyrdin
of Russia landing one right after the other.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and Chernomyrdin, say political and diplomatic
specialists, are the best hope yet for a breakthrough in the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not lost on anyone,'' said Ronald Walters, a professor
of government at the University of Maryland who was at Andrews to
welcome Jackson back from his mission to Belgrade. ``You got a real
feeling that this was an opening for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   First to touch down was a plane carrying a delegation led by
Jackson. Having freed three American servicemen over the weekend,
Jackson _ a specialist in informal, or ``stage 1'' diplomacy _ was
believed to be carrying an ice-breaking message from Slobodan
Milosevic to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later the plane carrying Chernomyrdin landed. The
second, more complicated stage of diplomacy _
government-to-goverment talks _ is currently in Chernomyrdin's
hands. He is thought to be carrying the beginnings of a framework
for a settlement between Yugoslavia and the US-led NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were bound for meetings with Clinton, who Monday said
NATO would not stop its bombing campaign until Milosevic began
pulling troops out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got closer to a diplomatic solution,'' Chernomyrdin said
after meeting with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But both missions, say diplomatic observers, are evidence that
attempts to negotiate an end to the war in the Balkans are finally
moving into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly Milosevic is trying to get information out,'' said
Eileen Babbitt, a specialist in international negotiation at Tufts
University's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. ``The challenge
now is to open real discussions, and the Russians are the best
option for that at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   It is still too early to tell whether the peacemaking efforts
will take off, much less succeed, after 41 days of NATO bombing and
the wholesale purge of Kosovo's Albanian population by Milosevic's
Serb forces. But if there is a breakthrough, the 57-year-old
Jackson's daring mission to Belgrade last weekend will get a large
measure of the credit.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has become a specialist in the past 15 years in what is
known as informal, or third-party, diplomacy, a type of peacemaking
also practiced by former president Jimmy Carter, UN Secretary
General Kofi Annan, and dozens of current and former politicians
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   It was Jackson who in 1984 persuaded Syrian president Hafez
Assad to free a captured US Navy pilot, Lieutenant Robert O.
Goodman Jr. Later that year he talked Fidel Castro into releasing
48 American and Cuban political prisoners. And in 1990, he won
freedom for more than 700 women and children being held as human
shields by Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse works best this way,'' said Roger Wilkins, a close
friend of Jackson's and a historian at George Mason University.
``He uses his celebrity to great advantage. This is one time where
his celebrity enhances the chance for success, and where the chance
for success is the ripest. And you have to figure that if Milosevic
even let him come to Belgrade it must be because he wanted to send
several messages to President Clinton that he otherwise could not
send.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins said he is not sure whether the Milosevic message will
be that it is time to negotiate or that the Yugoslav president is
not about to blink.
</P>
<P>
   But Wilkins and others who know Jackson say that the close
relationship between Clinton and Jackson _ a relationship once
strained by Clinton's 1992 criticism of Jackson and other black
leaders but now so intimate that Jackson frequently prayed with
Clinton during the dark days of the Monica Lewinsky scandal _
guarantees that Milosevic's words and any other signs from him will
be delivered in full to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Jackson's strength is that he is an American who,
because he is black, represents an underdog in the eyes of people
in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like Milosevic and Assad feel they are being beaten on
by America,'' said Brian Mandell, a lecturer in public policy at
Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. ``They see Jesse as
someone who also has had to deal with that in his own society.''
</P>
<P>
   Bert Lance, another long-time Jackson friend, said he is often
disappointed that critics claim Jackson is being ``manipulated'' by
the likes of Saddam Hussein or Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say that is 180-degrees wrong. You can't manipulate him.''
Nor is Jackson a simple intermediary, said Lance. He is a persuader
and will work to persuade everyone _ Milosevic, Clinton, the
general public _ that the fighting must end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally heartfelt as far as I'm concerned,'' said Lance,
who advised Jackson during his 1988 run for the Democratic
presidential nomination. ``He really believes in `keeping hope
alive,' and he sees a situation here where he believes hope is
needed. He is sincere. And, look, this'' mission to Belgrade ``was
not without personal risk. There were bombs going off. It was a
dangerous place to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into dangerous places without official diplomatic blessing
is often the only way to get the ball rolling when two sides have
staked out hard-line positions, said Babbitt. But government
officials often bite their nails during such missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officials don't know what these non-official actors are going
to say,'' she said. ``They have no control over them. That's what
makes them nervous. They might say or do something that undermines
the government's position.''
</P>
<P>
   That appears not to have happened in Jackson's case, she said.
His comments on landing Monday were no more radical than a call for
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must seize this moment to take the step to dramatic
diplomacy from bloody, protracted war,'' Jackson said. ``We have
the power to bomb. We should have the strength to negotiate. A
bridge has been blown up, the bridge of diplomacy and trust, and
that bridge must be restored.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Jackson succeeds in restoring dialog, an exceedingly
difficult task lies ahead: Hammering out an agreement that meets
the substance of NATO's demands _ allowing Kosovo's Albanians to
return under armed international protection. That will be the
central mission of Chernomyrdin and other diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Fisher, a professor at Harvard Law School and director of
the Harvard Negotiation Project, was involved in peacemaking
projects from Camp David to Nicaragua to Afghanistan. He sees the
Balkan conflict as extremely complicated in part because of the
sequencing that is needed. One of many examples he gives: How can
Serb forces be pulled out without leaving Serb civilians in Kosovo
vulnerable to revenge raids by members of the Kosovo Liberation
Army?
</P>
<P>
   ``The public ought to realize that moving to peace is terribly
difficult and complicated,'' said Fisher. ``The process is more
important than the ultimate solution, and it will require
third-party help.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin may be that party. If he is, the process will be
shuttle diplomacy _ a constant round of diplomatic missions aimed
at narrowing differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse Jackson can open doors,'' said Mandell, the Kennedy
school lecturer. ``He can change the discourse of escalation. He
can put an important pause in the situation. But he can't transform
the situation. It is up to others to work out the details on
international peacekeeping.''

   WASHINGTON _ The Senate plans to dodge a major vote Tuesday on
the Kosovo conflict by setting aside a measure that would authorize
President Clinton ``to use all necessary force and other means'' to
prevail in NATO's attack on Yugolsavia.
</P>
<P>
   Amid growing congressional anxiety over Clinton's Kosovo policy,
the White House and leaders of both parties Monday warned senators
against sending the world conflicting signals by effectively
sanctioning an all-out war in the Balkans a week after the House
officially refused to support US involvement in the NATO operation.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was prepared to heed the warnings by sidetracking the
resolution through a procedural vote, angering several war veterans
in the chamber who are pushing the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's somewhat amazing to me that Congress is not ready to make
clear its resolve,'' said Senator John F. Kerry, a Vietnam veteran
and cosponsor of the resolution. ``There is an awful lot of
hand-wringing and politics going on that seems to belie the reality
of what's at stake in this conflict,'' Kerry said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, sponsored by Senator John McCain, an Arizona
Republican and former prisoner of war in Vietnam, is aimed in part
at preventing the United States from engaging in limited military
action that could end in defeat, as occurred in the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, anticipating the Senate sidestepping the resolution,
blasted his colleagues for allowing ``American pilots and possibly
American soldiers to risk their lives for a cause that we will not
risk our careers for.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination,
attracted eight other cosponsors for the bipartisan measure,
including Connecticut Democrats Christopher J. Dodd and Joseph I.
Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   But an array of unlikely allies emerged to oppose the measure.
In a lengthy debate on the Senate floor, Clinton's foes said the
president's current policy is misguided and Congress should not be
seen as expanding his authority in the conflict. They argued the
measure would strip Congress of the power to stop the
administration from escalating the struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration needs to learn the rule of holes. When you
find yourself in one, stop digging,'' said Senator Tim Hutchinson,
an Arkansas Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats, including Kerry, called on Clinton to better
articulate his goals in the Kosovo conflict. The president's
supporters also criticized the administration for insisting from
the start that the United States would not use ground troops, to
the possible benefit of Yugoslavia's military planners.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of Democrats _ and some Republicans _ said Congress
should allow more time for the NATO airstrikes to work before the
Senate grants Clinton additional authority that he has yet to seek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is not the right time to debate a wider war,'' said
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who is expected to join a large majority
of his colleagues in voting to table the measure. ``President
Clinton has made it clear that if ground troops are necessary, he
will ask for the support of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, a former Republican senator
from Maine, spoke with the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, and
several former colleagues Monday in anticipation of a vote Monday
night to table the measure. But Lott postponed the vote until
Tuesday to permit senators to continue debating the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of the measure asserted their goal was not to give
Clinton ``carte blanche'' in the Balkans but to push him to prepare
for the possibility of sending in ground troops if the airstrikes
fail and the US military remains involved in the NATO mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are forcing the president to lead,'' said Senator Chuck
Hagel, a Nebraska Republican and Vietnam veteran. ``That's what
this resolution is about. We're not abdicating.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagel all but taunted his colleagues to permit a direct vote on
the measure. ``Isn't this terrible,'' he said sarcastically on the
Senate floor. ``We're actually asking senators to take a stand.
What is this country coming to, asking senators to stand up and
take a stand. It's offensive, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   One senator took a forceful stand: George V. Voinovich, an Ohio
Republican who is the only senator of Serbian ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to stop the bombing,'' said Voinovich, who blamed
Clinton, NATO and the State Department for ``allowing their egos to
get in the way of their common sense and good judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich, the former governor of Ohio, added: ``The time has
come for NATO to get off its high horse, restrain its ego and,
instead of trying to save face over a major foreign policy blunder,
start thinking about saving lives.''

HIGH COURT RESTRICTS REFUGEE STATUS FOR CRIMINALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Foreigners who have committed serious crimes in
their home countries are ineligible for refugee status here
regardless of the risk of persecution they face if deported, the
Supreme Court ruled unanimously on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision adopted the Clinton administration's interpretation
of how a would-be refugee's criminal past should be evaluated by
immigration officials. The justices rebuked a federal appeals court
for having failed to give adequate deference to the attorney
general's view of the matter by insisting that the severity of the
crime be balanced against the likely danger the foreigner faced if
returned home.
</P>
<P>
   The case before the court involved immigration officials'
efforts to deport a former student leader in Guatemala who had led
demonstrations that included forcing passengers off buses and then
burning the empty buses to protest rising fares. The Guatemalan,
Juan Anibal Aguirre-Aguirre, argued in seeking asylum and a
``withholding of deportation,'' a form of administrative relief,
that his actions were political and not criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Whether immigration officials properly rejected his political
defense was a second important issue in the case, with the justices
also ruling that the lower court had failed to defer to
administrative judgment that the actions were criminal.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. treaty on refugees, which the United States ratified in
1968, requires balancing the crime against the likelihood and
severity of persecution, under an official interpretation contained
in a handbook issued by the United Nations Office of High
Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.N. Handbook may be a useful interpretative aid, but it
is not binding'' on the attorney general, immigration officials, or
the federal courts, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the court
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The high commissioner's office filed a brief in the case on
Aguirre's behalf, telling the court that its analysis would be
highly influential on how the more than 100 other countries that
have signed the treaty would interpret their obligations to
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Aguirre entered the United States illegally in 1993. The law in
effect when deportation proceedings began against him the next year
made a foreigner who asserted a fear of persecution at home
ineligible for the administrative relief of a ``withholding of
deportation'' if ``there are serious reasons for considering that
the alien has committed a serious nonpolitical crime outside the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a matter of plain language,'' Kennedy said on Monday, ``it
is not obvious that an already-completed crime is somehow rendered
less serious by considering the further circumstance that the alien
may be subject to persecution if returned to his home country.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 revision of federal immigration law made the same
principle applicable to asylum, barring asylum once it was
determined that the asylum-seeker had committed a ``serious
nonpolitical crime.'' Previously, the attorney general had
discretion to grant asylum regardless of an applicant's criminal
past.
</P>
<P>
   Asylum is a broader form of relief than withholding of
deportation, allowing a successful applicant not only to avoid
being sent home but to apply for permanent residency after one
year. Because of the change in 1996 that placed the two on the same
footing, the decision on Monday, Immigration and Naturalization
Service vs. Aguirre, No. 97-1754, will affect future refugee cases
as well as those governed by the old law.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, an immigration judge found that Aguirre would
probably face persecution for his political activities if returned
to Guatelama and granted him both a withholding of deportation and
asylum. The Board of Immigration Appeals overturned the judgment
and ordered Aguirre deported, finding that although his actions and
those of his fellow students were politically motivated, ``those
goals were outweighed by their criminal strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in San Francisco, then
overturned the appeal board's ruling in the 1997 ruling that the
justices set aside on Monday..
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's opinion was broadly critical of the 9th Circuit's
decision, finding it erroneous not only for requiring immigration
officials to assess the risk of persecution but also for
second-guessing the officials' judgment as to whether a crime was
political or nonpolitical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judicial deference to the executive branch is especially
appropriate in the immigration context,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``A decision by the Attorney General to deem certain
violent offenses committed in another country as political in
nature, and to allow the perpetrators to remain in the United
States, may affect our relations with that country or its
neighbors. The judiciary is not well positioned to shoulder primary
responsibility for assessing the likelihood and importance of such
diplomatic repercussions.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The court identified what it saw as two principal errors in the
9th Circuit's approach to distinguishing political from
nonpolitical crimes. First, Kennedy said, the appeals court
mistakenly held that to be a ``serious nonpolitical crime,'' the
act had to be ``atrocious.'' The second error, he said, was to
require consideration of the political objectives and of whether
the criminal acts were proportionate to them.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the Board of Immigration Appeals had not yet
arrived at a ``comprehensive definition'' of how the nonpolitical
crimes provision was supposed to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Full elaboration of that standard should await further
cases,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a second, unrelated case on Monday, the court agreed to
resolve a longstanding ambiguity in criminal law, over whether a
person's ``sudden and unprovoked flight'' from a police officer is
sufficiently suspicious to justify the officer in stopping the
person and conducting a pat-down search.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Illinois vs. Wardlow, No. 98-1036, the Illinois
Supreme Court found that a Chicago police officer was not justified
in chasing and searching a man who had been standing in front of an
apartment building before bolting at the sight of four police cars
that converged on the neighborhood as part of an anti-drug
operation. The man, Sam Wardlow, was carrying a parcel that proved
to contain a loaded revolver.
</P>
<P>
   The question of what behavior provides enough evidence for a
brief, investigatory stop has divided the state and lower federal
courts for years. Most courts have agreed with the Illinois court
that flight alone is insufficient. In its appeal, Illinois said its
high court had created an ``untenable state of affairs'' under
which the police must ``shrug their shoulders and helplessly stand
watching'' while people run from them.
</P>
<P>
   But ``flight is an ambiguous act which does not alone indicate
criminal activity,'' the Cook County Public Defender's office told
the justices in trying unsuccessfully to persuade them not to hear
the state's appeal.

JACKSON A MASTER OF `THIRD PARTY' DIPLOMACY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN YEMMA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the runway at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland Monday
afternoon, you could watch jetliners carrying free-lance negotiator
Rev. Jesse L. Jackson and shuttle diplomat Viktor S. Chernomyrdin
of Russia landing one right after the other.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and Chernomyrdin, say political and diplomatic
specialists, are the best hope yet for a breakthrough in the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not lost on anyone,'' said Ronald Walters, a professor
of government at the University of Maryland who was at Andrews to
welcome Jackson back from his mission to Belgrade. ``You got a real
feeling that this was an opening for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   First to touch down was a plane carrying a delegation led by
Jackson. Having freed three American servicemen over the weekend,
Jackson _ a specialist in informal, or ``stage 1'' diplomacy _ was
believed to be carrying an ice-breaking message from Slobodan
Milosevic to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later the plane carrying Chernomyrdin landed. The
second, more complicated stage of diplomacy _
government-to-goverment talks _ is currently in Chernomyrdin's
hands. He is thought to be carrying the beginnings of a framework
for a settlement between Yugoslavia and the US-led NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were bound for meetings with Clinton, who Monday said
NATO would not stop its bombing campaign until Milosevic began
pulling troops out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got closer to a diplomatic solution,'' Chernomyrdin said
after meeting with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But both missions, say diplomatic observers, are evidence that
attempts to negotiate an end to the war in the Balkans are finally
moving into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly Milosevic is trying to get information out,'' said
Eileen Babbitt, a specialist in international negotiation at Tufts
University's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. ``The challenge
now is to open real discussions, and the Russians are the best
option for that at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   It is still too early to tell whether the peacemaking efforts
will take off, much less succeed, after 41 days of NATO bombing and
the wholesale purge of Kosovo's Albanian population by Milosevic's
Serb forces. But if there is a breakthrough, the 57-year-old
Jackson's daring mission to Belgrade last weekend will get a large
measure of the credit.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has become a specialist in the past 15 years in what is
known as informal, or third-party, diplomacy, a type of peacemaking
also practiced by former president Jimmy Carter, UN Secretary
General Kofi Annan, and dozens of current and former politicians
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   It was Jackson who in 1984 persuaded Syrian president Hafez
Assad to free a captured US Navy pilot, Lieutenant Robert O.
Goodman Jr. Later that year he talked Fidel Castro into releasing
48 American and Cuban political prisoners. And in 1990, he won
freedom for more than 700 women and children being held as human
shields by Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse works best this way,'' said Roger Wilkins, a close
friend of Jackson's and a historian at George Mason University.
``He uses his celebrity to great advantage. This is one time where
his celebrity enhances the chance for success, and where the chance
for success is the ripest. And you have to figure that if Milosevic
even let him come to Belgrade it must be because he wanted to send
several messages to President Clinton that he otherwise could not
send.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins said he is not sure whether the Milosevic message will
be that it is time to negotiate or that the Yugoslav president is
not about to blink.
</P>
<P>
   But Wilkins and others who know Jackson say that the close
relationship between Clinton and Jackson _ a relationship once
strained by Clinton's 1992 criticism of Jackson and other black
leaders but now so intimate that Jackson frequently prayed with
Clinton during the dark days of the Monica Lewinsky scandal _
guarantees that Milosevic's words and any other signs from him will
be delivered in full to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Jackson's strength is that he is an American who,
because he is black, represents an underdog in the eyes of people
in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like Milosevic and Assad feel they are being beaten on
by America,'' said Brian Mandell, a lecturer in public policy at
Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. ``They see Jesse as
someone who also has had to deal with that in his own society.''
</P>
<P>
   Bert Lance, another long-time Jackson friend, said he is often
disappointed that critics claim Jackson is being ``manipulated'' by
the likes of Saddam Hussein or Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say that is 180-degrees wrong. You can't manipulate him.''
Nor is Jackson a simple intermediary, said Lance. He is a persuader
and will work to persuade everyone _ Milosevic, Clinton, the
general public _ that the fighting must end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally heartfelt as far as I'm concerned,'' said Lance,
who advised Jackson during his 1988 run for the Democratic
presidential nomination. ``He really believes in `keeping hope
alive,' and he sees a situation here where he believes hope is
needed. He is sincere. And, look, this'' mission to Belgrade ``was
not without personal risk. There were bombs going off. It was a
dangerous place to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into dangerous places without official diplomatic blessing
is often the only way to get the ball rolling when two sides have
staked out hard-line positions, said Babbitt. But government
officials often bite their nails during such missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officials don't know what these non-official actors are going
to say,'' she said. ``They have no control over them. That's what
makes them nervous. They might say or do something that undermines
the government's position.''
</P>
<P>
   That appears not to have happened in Jackson's case, she said.
His comments on landing Monday were no more radical than a call for
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must seize this moment to take the step to dramatic
diplomacy from bloody, protracted war,'' Jackson said. ``We have
the power to bomb. We should have the strength to negotiate. A
bridge has been blown up, the bridge of diplomacy and trust, and
that bridge must be restored.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Jackson succeeds in restoring dialog, an exceedingly
difficult task lies ahead: Hammering out an agreement that meets
the substance of NATO's demands _ allowing Kosovo's Albanians to
return under armed international protection. That will be the
central mission of Chernomyrdin and other diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Fisher, a professor at Harvard Law School and director of
the Harvard Negotiation Project, was involved in peacemaking
projects from Camp David to Nicaragua to Afghanistan. He sees the
Balkan conflict as extremely complicated in part because of the
sequencing that is needed. One of many examples he gives: How can
Serb forces be pulled out without leaving Serb civilians in Kosovo
vulnerable to revenge raids by members of the Kosovo Liberation
Army?
</P>
<P>
   ``The public ought to realize that moving to peace is terribly
difficult and complicated,'' said Fisher. ``The process is more
important than the ultimate solution, and it will require
third-party help.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin may be that party. If he is, the process will be
shuttle diplomacy _ a constant round of diplomatic missions aimed
at narrowing differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse Jackson can open doors,'' said Mandell, the Kennedy
school lecturer. ``He can change the discourse of escalation. He
can put an important pause in the situation. But he can't transform
the situation. It is up to others to work out the details on
international peacekeeping.''

SLEDGE HAMMER USED TO KILL TEXAS MINISTER, WIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PATTY REINERT  
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Weimar minister and his wife, found beaten to death
in the church parsonage Sunday, were killed with a sledge hammer,
police said Monday as they investigated the first murders the town
of 2,000 could recall.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were lying in their bed,'' said Police Chief Bill
Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's in shock. Nobody here, even the old-timers I've
talked to, ever remembers a murder in Weimar.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston said the bodies of Weimar United Church of Christ
minister Norman J. ``Skip'' Sirnic and his wife, Karen, were
discovered Sunday morning after church members in the town 90 miles
west of Houston grew concerned that the couple had failed to show
up for services.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsy reports were not available Monday, but Livingston said
it appeared that the Sirnics were killed late Friday or early
Saturday. Their killer apparently broke into the house through a
rear door off the carport, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston said he called in investigators from the Fort Bend
County Sheriff's Department to help with the gathering of evidence
from the crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were searching for the couple's 1998 red Mazda
pickup, but Livingston stopped short of saying theft was believed
to be the motive for the killings. He noted that besides the
pickup, items taken from the Sirnics' home, including a Sega
Genesis video game and a VCR, were ``minor stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends said they spoke with the Sirnics by telephone about 10
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, and neighbors noticed that the pickup was missing from
the couple's driveway about 6 o'clock the next morning, the police
chief said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, church members began morning services without the
minister when he was presumed to be running late, said Donna
Trefny, who has attended the church for more than four decades and
occasionally helped out in the church office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not at all like him to be late,'' she said, so a couple
of church leaders went to check on the minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came back and just announced, `Something's happened,'''
Trefny said. ``And when we left the church, the police were there.
It's a terrible tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Skip Sirnic, who would have turned 47 Sunday, had been pastor at
the 130-member church for the past 10 years. Karen Sirnic, 47,
served as the church's secretary. The minister had a college-age
son from a previous marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Sirnic was remembered Monday as a caring pastor who made a point
of visiting the sick and elderly in hospitals and area nursing
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a man of considerable energy and considerable
compassion,'' said the Mark Miller, conference minister of the
South Central Conference of the United Church of Christ. ``He was
very enthusiastic and very active, but he was also quiet. He wasn't
out to go and save everybody, but when you needed him, he would be
there for you. There is a great deal of love here for him and
Karen.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said a steady stream of congregants and ministers from
other Weimar churches visited the church as word of the murders
circulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been coming in all day,'' he said. ``There is such
shock, and people want to ask, `Did this really happen?''' Miller
said counselors were on hand to talk with church members and people
from the community. Funeral arrangements were pending.

POSSIBLE REGGIE LEWIS DRUG USE AT ISSUE AS TRIAL OPENS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- As the malpractice trial stemming from the death of
Celtics star Reggie Lewis began Monday, attorneys for Lewis' widow
claimed that allegations of cocaine use by the Lewis are irrelevant
to the case, while a lawyer for one of the three cardiologists
being sued countered that it's the very core.
</P>
<P>
   Concealing such information would be the same as showing up in a
doctor's office with a stomach ache and failing to tell him you'd
just eaten ``a two-week-old meatloaf,'' said attorney William F.
Dailey Jr.,, who represents Dr. Gilbert Mudge, the cardiologist
whom Donna Harris-Lewis has accused of failing to diagnose her
husband's deadly heart condition.
</P>
<P>
   But attorney Robert G. Harley, who represents Harris-Lewis, said
allegations of drug use are immaterial, as well as false. Lewis's
doctors, he said, were responsible for providing top-qualty care
regardless of the cause of his heart condition.
</P>
<P>
   The first witness to testify Monday, Dr. Gerald Miley, a New
England Baptist internist who examined Lewis after he blacked out
during an April 1993 playoff game, said he asked Lewis three times
if he had used cocaine, and each time Lewis answered that he had
not.
</P>
<P>
   Miley said he ``took at face value'' Lewis's assurance that he
had not used cocaine because, ``I had no reason not to believe
him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dailey, in his opening statement to jurors in Suffolk
Superior Court, said Lewis had ``great motivation'' to hide any
ilegal drug use since disclosure would have nullified the balance
of his $9 million contract with the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   Miley, the initial witness called by Harris-Lewis's lawyers,
said that based on his review of tests conducted on Lewis, he
believed the 27-year-old suffered from a possibly life-threatening
heart abnormality, one that Harley claimed was treatable, if
properly diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had Reggie gotten a defibrillator, we wouldn't be here
today,'' Harley said in his opening statement. ``As a result of not
having that defibrillator, we all lost one of the finest young men
of his generation.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Mudge, Harris-Lewis has sued two other
physicians, Peter L. Friedman and Mark A. Creager, accusing them of
misdiagnosing her husband's heart condition. Harris-Lewis -- who
sat quietly in the front row of the spectator gallery, flanked by
acquaintances -- agreed to settle last week with a fourth doctor,
Dr. John Rutherford, now in practice in Texas. Details of the
settlement have not been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge says he could not accurately diagnose Lewis's condition
because Lewis withheld information on his cocaine use until two
weeks before he collapsed and died while shooting baskets at
Brandeis University on July 27, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis had sought a second opinion from Mudge after a team of
doctors at New England Baptist Hospital chosen by the Celtics
diagnosed Lewis with arrhythmia, a potentially life-threatening
defect that could end his career.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis then consulted with Mudge, one of Boston's most respected
cardiologists, at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge concluded that Lewis suffered from a neurological disorder
that caused fainting spells. With proper treatment, he said, Lewis
could return to basketball. Three months later, Lewis died while
shooting baskets in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   The state medical examiner listed the cause of death as
adenovirus 2, a virus that could have caused inflammation of the
heart, tissue scarring and, ultimately, death.
</P>
<P>
   Dailey suggested to jurors that Lewis had ignored doctors'
orders to restrict his physical activity to stretching,
weightlifting and tai chi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Lewis was told before he went out the door at Brigham and
Women's Hospital that he was not to exercise without having a
(heart) monitor in place,'' said Dailey, adding that a witness will
testify she saw Lewis ``glistening with sweat'' while shooting
baskets after his discharge.
</P>
<P>
   While the trial, which is expected to last four weeks, will
focus on whether Mudge and his two co-defendants at Brigham and
Women's Hospital made misjudgments that resulted in Lewis's death,
Monday's proceedings made clear that alleged cocaine use by Lewis
will be a key issue.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Harris-Lewis tried unsuccessfully to bar any mention
of alleged drug use from the trial, arguing that the issue had been
raised ``for the sole purpose of trashing'' Lewis's reputation.

SENATE READY TO AVOID KOSOVO POLICY VOTE 
</HEADLINE>

 By BOB HOHLER

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate plans to dodge a major vote Tuesday on
the Kosovo conflict by setting aside a measure that would authorize
President Clinton ``to use all necessary force and other means'' to
prevail in NATO's attack on Yugolsavia.
</P>
<P>
   Amid growing congressional anxiety over Clinton's Kosovo policy,
the White House and leaders of both parties Monday warned senators
against sending the world conflicting signals by effectively
sanctioning an all-out war in the Balkans a week after the House
officially refused to support US involvement in the NATO operation.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was prepared to heed the warnings by sidetracking the
resolution through a procedural vote, angering several war veterans
in the chamber who are pushing the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's somewhat amazing to me that Congress is not ready to make
clear its resolve,'' said Senator John F. Kerry, a Vietnam veteran
and cosponsor of the resolution. ``There is an awful lot of
hand-wringing and politics going on that seems to belie the reality
of what's at stake in this conflict,'' Kerry said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, sponsored by Senator John McCain, an Arizona
Republican and former prisoner of war in Vietnam, is aimed in part
at preventing the United States from engaging in limited military
action that could end in defeat, as occurred in the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, anticipating the Senate sidestepping the resolution,
blasted his colleagues for allowing ``American pilots and possibly
American soldiers to risk their lives for a cause that we will not
risk our careers for.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination,
attracted eight other cosponsors for the bipartisan measure,
including Connecticut Democrats Christopher J. Dodd and Joseph I.
Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   But an array of unlikely allies emerged to oppose the measure.
In a lengthy debate on the Senate floor, Clinton's foes said the
president's current policy is misguided and Congress should not be
seen as expanding his authority in the conflict. They argued the
measure would strip Congress of the power to stop the
administration from escalating the struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration needs to learn the rule of holes. When you
find yourself in one, stop digging,'' said Senator Tim Hutchinson,
an Arkansas Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats, including Kerry, called on Clinton to better
articulate his goals in the Kosovo conflict. The president's
supporters also criticized the administration for insisting from
the start that the United States would not use ground troops, to
the possible benefit of Yugoslavia's military planners.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of Democrats _ and some Republicans _ said Congress
should allow more time for the NATO airstrikes to work before the
Senate grants Clinton additional authority that he has yet to seek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is not the right time to debate a wider war,'' said
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who is expected to join a large majority
of his colleagues in voting to table the measure. ``President
Clinton has made it clear that if ground troops are necessary, he
will ask for the support of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, a former Republican senator
from Maine, spoke with the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, and
several former colleagues Monday in anticipation of a vote Monday
night to table the measure. But Lott postponed the vote until
Tuesday to permit senators to continue debating the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of the measure asserted their goal was not to give
Clinton ``carte blanche'' in the Balkans but to push him to prepare
for the possibility of sending in ground troops if the airstrikes
fail and the US military remains involved in the NATO mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are forcing the president to lead,'' said Senator Chuck
Hagel, a Nebraska Republican and Vietnam veteran. ``That's what
this resolution is about. We're not abdicating.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagel all but taunted his colleagues to permit a direct vote on
the measure. ``Isn't this terrible,'' he said sarcastically on the
Senate floor. ``We're actually asking senators to take a stand.
What is this country coming to, asking senators to stand up and
take a stand. It's offensive, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   One senator took a forceful stand: George V. Voinovich, an Ohio
Republican who is the only senator of Serbian ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to stop the bombing,'' said Voinovich, who blamed
Clinton, NATO and the State Department for ``allowing their egos to
get in the way of their common sense and good judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich, the former governor of Ohio, added: ``The time has
come for NATO to get off its high horse, restrain its ego and,
instead of trying to save face over a major foreign policy blunder,
start thinking about saving lives.''

   El Al Marks Jubilee With Free Stop in Rome
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate demand linked to celebrations in Rome and
Jerusalem, beginning this summer El Al will offer a stopover in
Rome at no extra charge to passengers traveling between New York
and Tel Aviv. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Vatican committee in charge of pilgrimages to
Israel for the Great Jubilee Year 2000 named El Al its official
carrier to the Holy Land. Beginning June 21, the airline will
provide flights from Kennedy International Airport to Rome leaving
at 6:45 p.m. on Monday and Thursday and arriving at 8:50 a.m. the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   These dates accommodate travelers who want to hear Pope John
Paul II's addresses on Wednesday and Saturday. Daily flights from
Rome to Tel Aviv, except for Friday, leave at 10:50 a.m., arriving
in Israel at 3 p.m. Pilgrims who wish to take their stopover in
Rome on the return trip may also do that at no extra charge. Round
trip tickets valid from July 11 to Sept. 16 cost $829, not counting
taxes, if purchased by Tuesday; thereafter the price is $1,486.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jubilee celebrations in Rome, Jerusalem and in local churches
elsewhere began this Easter and continue to Christmas 2000.
Information: (800) 223-6700 or (212) 768-9200.

   From Slag Heap To Serial Gardens
</P>
<P>
   Two former Yorkshire coal mines are the unlikely site of a new
British attraction that celebrates environmental awareness. The
Earth Center, a $160 million science center, opened last month in
Doncaster, 172 miles north of London. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indoor and outdoor exhibitions, including gardens, play areas,
adventure trails and high-tech galleries, aim to convey serious
messages about ways to protect the earth's resources. The cleaning
up of the slag and polluted soil of these former coal mines is
itself an example of regeneration. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the themed areas is the Planet Earth Galleries, a vast
space with a subterranean feel. Echoing acoustics and kaleidoscopic
images projected onto rotating glass panels and gigantic glass
spheres create a range of effects, from the blur of a busy highway
to the green calm of a rain forest: a solar spectrum installation
using lights, projection prisms and mirrors creates a rainbow.
</P>
<P>
   In the Action for the Future Gallery, magic windows with
three-dimensional clouds reveal visions of a ``fantastic future''
in cities and in the countryside, with examples of such projects as
purifying water in Tanzania and preserving Antarctica from
industrialization. In Nature Works, children can collect aquatic
bugs and view magnified insects on a giant screen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 35-acre grounds include a forest garden and 21st century
terrace garden and orchards. Water from the nearby River Don is
treated and used in five colorful bog gardens, and even the
lavatories are an exhibit, with waste water being cleaned by algae
and sunlight. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A restaurant, three cafes, a barbecue and bar serve organic food
whenever possible. The Earth Center, Denaby Main, Doncaster DN12
4EA, telephone (44-1709) 512000. Open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.,
March to October. Admission $14.50, children $11.
</P>
<P>
   Bargain Prices For Haute Cuisine
</P>
<P>
   A half-price sale at the Paris Ritz? It's true. The two-star
restaurant at one of Paris' fanciest hotels will soon be serving
langoustines in dill jelly, breaded asparagus with morel mushrooms,
a grenadin de veau, and cherries jubilee _ along with assorted
wines and coffee _ for $85 a person. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The catch? It's a one-day deal. On May 27, the Ritz, (33-1)
43.16.30.80, will join more than 3,000 other restaurants throughout
France to celebrate the fourth annual Fete de la Cuisine by
slashing the price of a gastronomic fixed-price meal by 50
percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The festival aims to initiate a new clientele to the joy of fine
dining, and participating restaurateurs are encouraged to spotlight
regional products. The cozy Auberge des Arts in Nice, (33-4)
93.85.63.53, plans a five-course meal around pigeon farci a la
nicoise and Provencal wine for $45. The one-star Restaurant Pierre
Orsi in Lyons, (33-4) 78.89.57.68, will serve Macon and Cote du
Rhone wines with six courses that include smoked salmon, truffled
ravioli stuffed with foie gras, turbot in champagne sauce and duck
a l'orange with mushroom risotto for $65. The Parisian one-star
chef Bernard Fournier of Le Petit Colombier, (33-1) 43.80.28.54,
organizes the event. ``I love to connect with people who couldn't
dream of eating at such fancy places at normal prices,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This year, Ireland, Sweden, Germany, Italy, Spain and Luxembourg
will join the initiative for the first time. A distinctive Fete
poster will be displayed outside all participating restaurants. An
updated list with addresses and telephone numbers can be found at
www.lhotellerie.fr.

   Variations on a Theme: Flexible Flashlights
</P>
<P>
   Two new flashlights may interest travelers. One is ideal for
backpackers; the other is powered by a hand crank and would be
valuable when batteries fail, or as an automobile emergency light. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The smaller light, the Ranger, by Lumatec, has an
inch-and-a-half fluorescent bulb at one end and a bulb with a
focused beam at the other. It is 5 inches long and 3 inches wide at
the wider end, and can be stood on end or hung by a lanyard with
either end facing down. It operates on four AA batteries, and comes
with one replacement bulb but no batteries, for $19.95.
Information: (800) 776-7945. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Freeplay ``self powered'' lantern can be plugged into an
outlet and charged so it will operate for two hours, or you can
charge it by winding it up. If its retractable handle is wound 60
turns, the power is retained indefinitely until it is used. It can
provide a steady or a flashing beam. It is 10 inches long, 5 inches
wide and weighs 4 pounds 2 ounces. It can be used to provide power
to other devices that use batteries. Including an extra bulb, it
costs $69 at Sharper Image, Discovery Channel and other specialty
stores. Information: (800) 946-3234. &QL;

   A Sculpture Garden at the National Gallery
</P>
<P>
   The National Gallery of Art will open a sculpture garden on a
six-acre site near its West Building on May 23, providing an
outdoor setting for the works of such artists as Louise Bourgeois,
Mark di Suvero, Roy Lichtenstein, Sol LeWitt, Ellsworth Kelly,
Lucas Samaras, Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, and Tony
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The new sculpture garden, which is not far from the Hirshhorn
Museum's sculpture garden just across the Washington Mall, was
built with a gift from the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz
Foundation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was designed by Laurie D. Olin, a landscape architect, around
an existing circular pool that is converted to an ice-skating rink
in the winter. The garden will be enclosed by a decorative metal
fence with marble piers and plinths designed to complement the
classical style of the West Building. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the opening, on May 22, a free afternoon jazz
concert on the Mall will celebrate both the sculpture garden and
the 100th anniversary of Duke Ellington's birth. The performers
will be the Duke Ellington Orchestra and the Dukes of Dixieland. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Admission to the sculpture garden, as well as to the National
Gallery itself, is free. Hours for both: Monday to Saturday 10 a.m.
to 5 p.m., Sunday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Information: (202) 737-4215. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a season that brought works by Tennessee Williams,
Arthur Miller and Eugene O'Neill to Broadway, those playwrights
showed their staying power Monday when their dramas led the Tony
Award nominations for straight play.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' ``Not About Nightingales,'' a prison drama that
received its first production this year _ more than 60 years after
it was written and 16 years after the author's death _ took six
nominations, including one for best new play.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's ``Death of a Salesman'' was also nominated in six
categories, including best revival, best director (Robert Falls)
and best leading actor (Brian Dennehy). Miller was also awarded a
special Tony for lifetime achievement that is to be presented at
the ceremony on June 6.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill's ``Iceman Cometh'' took five, including the nomination
for best revival of a play, tying with ``Twelfth Night'' and the
ballet ``Swan Lake.''
</P>
<P>
   And offering proof that there can be life after death in the
theater, the musical ``Parade,'' which was produced by Lincoln
Center and Livent and closed in February, won nine nominations, the
most of any production. Nominations for the production, which
recounted the 1915 lynching of Leo Frank, a Jewish factory
supervisor in Georgia, included best musical, best direction of a
musical (Harold Prince), best original score (Jason Robert Brown)
and best performance by a leading actor and actress in a musical
(Brent Carver and Carolee Carmello).
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum, David Hare, the British
playwright who brought an impressive three productions to Broadway
this season, was effectively shut out of the competition. Not one
of his plays _ ``The Blue Room,'' ``Amy's View'' or the acclaimed
``Via Dolorosa,'' the one-man production in which he stars _ was
nominated for best play. Two members of the cast of ``Amy's View''
did receive nominations: Judi Dench for best performance by a
leading actress in a play, and Samantha Bond for best performance
by a featured actress in a play.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``Not About Nightingales,'' nominations for best
new play went to ``Closer,'' by Patrick Marber; ``The Lonesome
West,'' by Martin McDonagh, and ``Side Man,'' by Warren Leight.
</P>
<P>
   This year's nominees, announced Monday morning by Dennehy and
Swoosie Kurtz at Sardi's restaurant, were selected by a group of 28
theater professionals appointed by a Tony Awards administration
committee. The Tony Awards, now in their 53rd year, are presented
by the League of American Theaters and Producers and the American
Theater Wing, which founded the awards in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   The Tony Awards will be voted in 21 categories by 812 theater
professionals and journalists who are scheduled to mail their
ballots at the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more glaring omissions from this year's nominees were
``The Weir,'' Conor McPherson's new play, and ``On the Town,''
which _ though Mary Testa was nominated for best featured actress
in a musical _ was excluded from the best musical revival category
in favor of ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' ``Little Me,'' ``Peter Pan''
and ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   The actresses Natasha Richardson and Anna Friel of ``Closer''
were also passed over.
</P>
<P>
   And despite Kevin Spacey's insistence that ``The Iceman Cometh''
is an ensemble production (he refused top billing), and strong
reviews for several performers in the 19-member cast, only Spacey
received a nomination _ for best leading actor in a play.
</P>
<P>
   There were also some unorthodox nominees this year. Although
Matthew Bourne's production of ``Swan Lake'' was deemed ineligible
for best musical, it won five nominations Monday, including best
performance by a leading actor in a musical (Adam Cooper), best
direction and best choreography (Bourne for both).
</P>
<P>
   While the choreography for ``Fosse'' was ruled ineligible on the
grounds that it was adapted from Bob Fosse's original steps, the
production was nominated for best new musical.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``Parade,'' nominations went to several other
productions that have already closed. ``Twelfth Night,'' which
closed in August, received five nominations, including best revival
of a play and best original score for Jeanine Tesori's music to
Shakespeare's words. ``Little Me,'' which closed in February,
received four nominations, including best performance by a leading
actor in a musical (Martin Short). And ``Marlene,'' which closed on
Sunday, was nominated for two awards: best book of a musical (Pam
Gems) and best performance by a leading actress in a musical (Sian
Phillips).
</P>
<P>
   A Tony Award could mean a much-needed financial boost for
several productions with flagging ticket sales, namely ``Not About
Nightingales'' and ``Side Man.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the pre-nomination jockeying by several producers
apparently paid off; ``It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues,'' which
opened off-Broadway, was nominated for best musical after moving to
the Vivian Beaumont, a Tony-eligible theater, just before the
deadline. And Elizabeth Franz was nominated in the featured actress
category after the producers of ``Death of a Salesman''
successfully lobbied to move her from the leading actress category,
which was considered more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, such strategic moves were unsuccessful. Despite
winning Tony consideration for Peter Stone's revised version of
``Annie Get Your Gun,'' the musical was not nominated for best book
(though the show did receive three other nominations, including one
for best revival).
</P>
<P>
   The first hour of the Tony Awards ceremony, which moves from
Radio City Music Hall to the Gershwin Theater this year, will be
broadcast live on PBS beginning at 8 p.m. The remaining two hours
will be seen on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Special awards for lifetime achievement will also be given to
the actress Uta Hagen and to Isabelle Stevenson, chairwoman of the
American Theater Wing. Another special Tony will be presented to
the production of ``Fool Moon,'' and the annual regional theater
award, which includes a $25,000 grant, will go to the Crossroads
Theater Company of New Brunswick, N.J.

CLINTON AND JAPANESE PREMIER ANNOUNCE DEREGULATION INITIATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
of Japan professed Monday to be in fundamental agreement on
strategies to pull Japan out of a seven-year-long slump and
deregulate its economy. But their daylong meeting underscored how
many of Clinton's once-ambitious economic initiatives with Tokyo
have been sunk by the Japanese recession.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi, the sixth prime minister Clinton has dealt with in six
years, spent all morning at the White House, talking about the
containment of North Korea, Japanese aid to Kosovar refugees and
deregulation. He and the president then announced agreement on
deregulating a range of Japanese industries, from
telecommunications to medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
   For example, foreign firms will now be able to own 100 percent
of cable television operations in Japan and foreign
telecommunications companies will be guaranteed more fairly priced
rates to connect into Japan's domestic telephone network.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Clinton went out of his way to praise
Obuchi while pressing him to ``use all available tools to restore
solid growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides said they feared that any of the benefits of
Japan's government spending program to spur the world's
second-largest economy has been undercut by the unwillingness of
many Japanese companies and consumers to spend. And they
acknowledged that Monday's deregulatory accord would mean little if
Japan's economy keeps contracting.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Japanese recession has changed the nature of
meetings between Japan's leaders and Clinton. The president came
into office promising to exert great pressure on Japan, open its
markets, and invoke sanctions if Japan's bureaucracy stood in the
way. But that energy was spent after the United States and Japan
battled over an accord on automotive trade in the summer of 1994,
and it has never really recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The auto agreement was the first big effort by the Clinton
administration to clear away regulatory hurdles that American
manufacturers had complained about for years. But while the
agreement led to some changes in Japanese regulations, the economic
benefits Clinton had envisioned never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For example, under that agreement the administration once
boasted that the Big Three auto companies would be displaying their
cars in more than 1,000 Japanese showrooms by this year. They are
now in 193 showrooms, the U.S. Trade Representative's office says,
scarcely more than when the accord was signed.
</P>
<P>
   And sales of cars manufactured by Ford, GM and DaimlerChrysler
are down by 34 percent in the first quarter of this year, compared
to the same quarter in 1998. That is a far steeper decline than the
than the falloff in overall Japanese car sales _ yet the president,
who was briefed on the decline, never mentioned it in Monday's
meeting, according to participants.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of Japan fatigue around here, and it was evident
in the meetings,'' one senior administration official said Monday.
``There comes a moment when you recognize that while you've made
some progress, it's hard to provide much proof that American
workers or companies are going to benefit anytime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the most notable shift in recent times is the absence
of pressure from the business community to press Japan for more
openings.
</P>
<P>
   American auto executives are virtually silent about Japan these
days, and DaimlerChrysler walked away recently from a chance to
take a big stake in the ailing Nissan Motor Corp., the second
largest Japanese manufacturer. Estimates from private economists
that Japan will be lucky to grow at 1 or 2 percent annually over
the next decade have scared away many American companies, even
though the cost of buying land for factories in Japan have not been
this low in decades.
</P>
<P>
   The result is an astounding turnaround: American companies are
turning their backs on 120 million of the world's richest
consumers, at the very moment that the Japanese government says,
for the first time since before World War II, that it is actively
seeking American investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prime Minister Obuchi said to the president today, `We would
like to see American companies invest more heavily in Japan,' ''
Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. Trade Representative, said Monday.
``In six years here, that's the first time I've heard a Japanese
prime minister utter those words.''
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi argues that deregulation is critical to reviving Japanese
industry, and many Japanese executives agree. His Economic Strategy
Council _ made up of business executives, former bureaucrats and
other influential Japanese _ recently circulated in Japanese and
English an extensive report detailing laws and regulations that
should be swept away. They ranged from proposals to establish
high-technology businesses to the development of bankruptcy laws
that would allow the sell-off of assets of unsustainable
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Japan experts note that similar reports have been prepared in
Japan since the early 1980s _ and resisted by bureaucrats who did
not want to lose control over every aspect of the economy, and by
businesses that feared the onset of competition. But there are
signs now that Japan's prolonged pain has result in a rethinking,
in which the deregulation of American industries has become a
model.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of Japanese firms who now realize that
bringing down their costs _ their energy costs, their
telecommunications costs _ are critical to their survival,'' said
Richard Fischer, Ms. Barshefsky's deputy, who lived in Japan for a
year while working in private industry.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite the clear effort by the White House and Obuchi's
handlers to portray this as a harmonious summit, there were two
areas of clear disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton warned Obuchi, first in private, then more mildly in
public, that he would begin a trade action against Japan if its
shipments of steel to the United States did not soon return to the
levels that existed before the onset of the Asian economic crisis.
A flood of low-cost foreign steel has already resulted in some job
losses in the steel industry, leading to a Commerce Department
action to penalize Japan and other countries for ``dumping'' steel
at prices below the cost of production. While Japan's shipments to
the United States have fallen in recent months, Clinton vowed
stiffer action unless the levels decline even more.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders did a more delicate dance around the question of
whether Japan will continue its huge deficit spending _ amounting
to 8 percent of its gross national product _ to spur the economy.
Obuchi has been reluctant to promise further spending, even though
it is becoming increasingly clear that Japan's economy will shrink
without it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have adequate policy measures in place,'' he said at
Monday's press conference. ``We will continue to look at
developments as they transpire.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said only that Japan should keep its spending measures
in place until the economy recovers.

TOP-SECRET BOMB BELIEVED USED TO BLACK OUT YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Deletes inappropriate close quote in penultimate graf.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The top-secret weapon that zapped a large part of Yugoslavia's
electrical power supply was a ``soft bomb'' first used in the Gulf
War. The high-tech weapon was developed by the Navy after a
training mission accidentally blacked out a portion of Southern
California, defense analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials refused to comment Monday on the bomb that
sprayed graphite over the power station and shorted its circuits,
though they were clearly pleased at its apparent ability to turn
out the lights in Belgrade virtually at will.
</P>
<P>
   The weapon was targeted at the large, open-air switching yards
that connect electrical power plants to the grid of power
distribution lines that serve large areas through substations and
individual electric lines, said John Pike, an analyst for the
Federation of American Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb can be delivered either by cruise missiles or aircraft,
but NATO wouldn't even say how the devices got to their targets
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   When the bomb is detonated in the air over the electrical
facility, the explosion hurls a number of smaller ``bomblets'' that
in turn spew many spools of graphite thread into the air. Graphite
is a good conductor of electricity, and when the threads fall onto
the electrical wires of the switching stations, they short-circuit
the power lines and send huge surges of electricity through the
entire power grid, said Pike.
</P>
<P>
   Pike compared the effect to that of sticking a fork into a
toaster. ``It not only blows out the toaster, but trips the circuit
breaker in the house,'' he said. The bomb ``is going to damage or
destroy some of the hardware in the switchyard itself, and put a
surge through the grid and trip out a lot of the substations,'' he
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the strikes knocked out power to about 70 percent
of Serbia for about seven hours overnight. Department of Defense
spokesman Kenneth Bacon, refused to speak about the bomb, which he
said is ``highly classified,'' but mentioned that one goal of using
it was that it ``disorients and confuses their computers by
shutting them off quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   This strategy first appeared in the Gulf War, when similar
bombs, known as KIT-18s, were used to attack power stations around
Baghdad, said Pike. They contained flexible metal strips instead of
graphite fibers.
</P>
<P>
   In their 1995 book, ``The General's War: The Inside Story of the
Conflict in the Gulf,'' Michael Gordon and Bernard Trainor say the
idea for the bomb grew out of a training accident in Southern
California. Aircraft were dropping ``chaff,'' hundreds of metallic
strips long used to confuse enemy radar, when a bunch of it fell
onto a power switching station and blacked out a large area of
Orange County, the book says.
</P>
<P>
   In a flash of inspiration, someone in the Navy saw the makings
of a new weapon, which is now enabling NATO to put ``its finger on
the light switch in Yugoslavia,'' as NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said
Monday.

 &HT;    Dole's money trickling in from spectrum of support in Georgia
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Truett Cathy and Michael Leven have spent more than 90 years
between them serving people, Cathy at his Chick-Fil-A restaurants
and Leven at a succession of hotel chains.
</P>
<P>
   But Cathy tends to prefer Republican candidates, while Leven
often is comfortable with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, both men are supporting former Red Cross
president Elizabeth Dole's bid for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   And their financial help, along with donations from such other
prominent Georgians as Deen Day Smith and Ginny Millner, is an
example of the range of support Dole needs if she is to be
successful.
</P>
<P>
   The $55,250 Dole raised in Georgia in the first three months of
1999 is a pittance in a presidential campaign in which $20 million
is likely to be the price of admission.
</P>
<P>
   But her list of Georgia contributors illustrates a certain
diversity that meshes with Dole's aim of reaching beyond
traditional GOP voters, especially since she is taking nuanced
stands on such sensitive issues as abortion rights and gun control
that may alienate the most conservative Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Leven, president of U.S. Franchise Systems and a 14-year Atlanta
resident, and Cathy are interesting bookends. Leven backed
Democrats Max Cleland and Michael Coles in the two most recent U.S.
Senate campaigns. Cathy sided with Republicans Guy Millner and Paul
Coverdell, although he made a small donation to Cleland in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Leven backs abortion rights and is active in local Jewish
affairs. Cathy closes his restaurant chain on Sundays and is known
for his commitment to Christianity as well as to his chicken
sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have some disagreements, but so what?'' Leven said of
Dole, a born-again Christian and opponent of abortion rights. ``The
most important part is that she offers leadership, she's a
wonderful role model and her heart is in the right place. She is
not running to fulfill any ego requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   Leven met Dole in the early 1990s when he was president of
Holiday Inn Worldwide and organized a promotion with the Red Cross.
Dole eventually invited Leven to join the Red Cross's board of
governors.
</P>
<P>
   She also asked Leven for his help on her campaign. He and
Atlanta attorney Oscar Persons are the only Georgians on her
125-member national finance committee.
</P>
<P>
   Leven said he has sent 400 to 500 letters seeking contributions
to people on his ``holiday card list.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People have called to say they to help or volunteer,'' Leven
said. ``They feel she's an underdog, but that she's viable.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathy was not available for an interview for this article. But
Chick-Fil-A spokesman Don Perry said Cathy met Dole for the first
time last fall when they were on the same program of motivational
speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do both Cathy and Dole share religious beliefs, they
also may be distant relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Dole's mother is a member of the Cathey family, and while the
name is spelled differently, ``We believe it is from the same
family tree,'' Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other Georgia contributors, Millner is an evangelical
Christian who is married to Guy Millner. Smith, whose first husband
built the Days Inn motel chain, also is known for her support for
Christian causes. But she is a conservative Democrat, even if her
son, Clint Day, is a former Republican state lawmaker and candidate
for senator and lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   Dole's other Georgia donors include: James McMahan, a builder
whose apartment complexes reshaped Atlanta's Lenox Road; David
Shafer, the Republican nominee for secretary of state in 1996;
Randolph Thrower, an Atlanta lawyer and former chairman of the
city's Ethics Board; and Marilea Towery, the wife of former state
Republican Rep. Matt Towery.

 &HT;    Companies like BellSouth lead the way in donations
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore earned nothing but scorn for
his exaggerated claim of inventing the Internet. But the
self-described technology junkie is laughing all the way to the
bank as he solicits contributions from the nation's multibillion
dollar technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at Georgia's BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   In just four days in February and March, 37 BellSouth executives
and spouses chipped in $46,500 to Gore's 2000 presidential
campaign, one of the biggest showings of individual support from
any company in the country.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth CEO F. Duane Ackerman and his wife, Kappy, led the
way, each contributing the maximum - $1000 to the primary election
and another $1000 to the general election campaign. Senior
BellSouth executives from Atlanta to New Orleans followed suit,
writing checks for $1,000 that were hand-delivered to Gore's
campaign in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman declined to be interviewed for this article. But
Margaret Greene, who heads the company's lobbying and regulation
unit and first met Gore in 1985, said Gore was a natural for
BellSouth, the world's ninth largest telephone company, because of
his family ties to Tennessee and his technological savvy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've known him for a long time and have been working with him
a long time,'' said Greene, adding that BellSouth employees were
also long-time supporters of Gore's father, the late senator Albert
Gore Sr.
</P>
<P>
   Since being elected vice president in 1992, Gore has taken an
active role in shaping policy at the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) and positioned himself as the administration's
principal voice on technology issues. He fashioned the
administration's position on the massive telecommunications
deregulation bill of 1996 and he has been the White House's leading
advocate of linking all school classrooms to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's involvement in technology issues is paying handsome
dividends as he gears up for his 2000 presidential bid. Gore raised
more than $75,000 from the computer industry in the first quarter
of 1999, most of it from the cash-rich Internet and chip companies
located in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of BellSouth, Greene said the company is most
interested in how Gore and the federal government will step into
the raging band width debate - a battle between cable providers,
wireless companies, long distance telephone companies and the
regional Bells over how Internet and telephone access will be piped
into homes across America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of our technology, telecommunications networking
technology, as a reform vehicle is something the vice president has
been in the lead talking about for as long as I can remember,'' she
said. ``He is one of the more active voices in how the Internet
rolls out and how our technology is advanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Regional telephone companies are also increasingly optimistic
that the current FCC panel, composed of three Democrats and two
Republicans and all appointed by Clinton, will finally allow a
regional Bell to offer long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   For BellSouth, this is a $10 billion market in its nine-state
service area. Ackerman recently predicted that 20 to 30 percent of
that market could be BellSouth's if it were allowed to compete with
AT&AMP;T, Sprint and other long-distance carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Norm Ornstein, a scholar with the American Enterprise Institute
who was picked by Gore to be on commission studying digital
television, said technology and telecommunications companies like
Gore because the Clinton administration has taken a hands-off
approach to regulating the emerging technologies of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That obviously appeals to these folks,'' Ornstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Moir, a Washington lobbyist who represents business
telephone users, said BellSouth is supporting Gore because of what
he isn't talking about. Moir said that Gore has been silent on the
issue of lowering the access charges the regional Bells charge to
long distance companies, fees which in turn are passed on to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far he hasn't said word boo about rate reductions, and this
is a guy who never missed a mike during the '96 telecom fight,''
said Moir. ``You know you can't talk about billions of dollars of
rate reductions and then go to a fund-raiser with BellSouth.''
</P>
<P>
   With 88,450 employees and $23.1 billion in revenues, BellSouth
is one of Georgia's biggest corporations and one of its biggest
political players. Its two PACs are the state's second largest
behind UPS. And adding in personal donations from company
executives and unregulated soft-money donations to the two major
political parties, the company consistently ranks as one of the
biggest political givers in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998 elections, BellSouth made nearly $1.4 million in
donations to candidates and parties, 55.5 percent to Republicans
and 45.5 percent to Democrats. So far this year, the company has
contributed $54,400 in soft money to the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee (DCCC).
</P>
<P>
   The company also made $5,000 PAC donations to GOP hopefuls Lamar
Alexander and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) this winter. The Alexander
donation came at the request of BellSouth employees from Tennessee,
and the contribution to McCain, chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee, was in recognition of McCain's long-standing ties to the
company, Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been helpful to us on the Commerce Committee, he
understands our issues very well and a lot of people are committed
to him,'' Greene said of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   But Greene said she will continue to do whatever she can to help
the vice president. ``I hope I'm not done yet,'' she said.

SOME U.S. COMPANIES START TO ADDRESS EMPLOYEE BURNOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Calif., Colo.)  (mk) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, Linda Davis, the Great Lakes-area sales manager
for Hewlett-Packard, realized she had a crisis on her hands. Her
sales team had been chalking up impressive revenues, but the strain
of long work hours was showing. There were too many broken
marriages, the attrition rate had risen to 20 percent, and when
asked on the annual company survey if they were ``experiencing
excessive pressure'' on the job, more than 50 percent of her staff
members had said yes.
</P>
<P>
   So when headquarters sought volunteers for an experimental
program to reduce and redesign workloads, Ms. Davis jumped.
Employees are now asked to set annual goals not only for
productivity but for leisure as well. They are expected to meet
both, and if they fall short, their supervisors have to answer for
it.
</P>
<P>
   At monthly meetings, team members are asked to list three
business goals and three personal ones. And when a staffer achieves
a milestone, like leaving at 2 p.m. to take a daughter ice skating,
co-workers are encouraged to applaud with the same gusto as they
would for someone landing a large order for laser printers.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a decade of piling on the responsibilities, a
smattering of American companies like Hewlett-Packard are beginning
to worry about the consequences. Concerns ranging from a lack of
creativity to ``burnout'' _ the point at which an employee becomes
too tired to work effectively or, sometimes, even at all _ have
emerged as among the most urgent topics at human resources forums.
The movement to do something about the problem is just beginning,
but some companies are experimenting with ways to alleviate
outsized workloads. Reforms include everything from limiting work
to 40 hours a week to discouraging employees from checking their
e-mail and phone messages over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   At Hewlett-Packard, Ms. Davis admits that the emphasis on
leisure has had a noticeable effect on the work side of the
equation. Some tasks have been reorganized so they can be shared by
9-to-5 administrative assistants, and on the whole, ``expectations
have been lowered.'' Still, she says, productivity has barely
suffered where it counts. The Great Lakes area remains one of
Hewlett-Packard's top sales regions, and out of a staff of 74, she
lost only two people last year _ both of whom were promoted within
the company. Moreover, several staff members who received outside
offers have stayed put, and one top performer who had been lured
away by a start-up actually returned.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the last wave of corporate initiatives aimed at helping
employees balance work with their personal lives _ initiatives that
included flexible hours, telecommuting and concierge services _ new
programs like Hewlett-Packard's aim for more than convenience. At
their most ambitious they address the fundamental problem of how
much time a job demands and how to build a life beyond work.
</P>
<P>
   The incidence of burnout has not been measured in any meaningful
way, but since the corporate downsizing of the '80s, American
workers report feeling more pressed at work. Professionals and
managers said they clocked an average of 48 hours a week, according
to a 1997 work force study conducted by the Families and Work
Institute, a nonprofit research group in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But to judge by anecdotal evidence, a significant subgroup toils
upward of 55 hours a week, while part-timers often find themselves
putting in more than 35 hours a week. In the automobile and
communications industries, hourly wage-earners have also seen their
week grow as mandatory overtime has become more prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   The main impetus for the current effort to re-evaluate growing
workloads is the drum-tight labor market, in which unemployment is
at a 30-year low. ``These days,'' says Peter Cappelli, author of
``The New Deal of Work: Managing the Market-Driven Workforce''
(Harvard Business School Press, 1999), ``employees are able to push
back a lot more and are much less willing to work themselves to
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Adjusting to the new environment has been especially difficult
for the most demanding employers. The Big Five accounting firms,
which are notorious for their grueling hours and travel schedules,
have suddenly found that their young, intensively trained staff
members are being snatched away. Deborah Holms, director of the
office for retention at Ernst &AMP; Young, hopes the firm's new
emphasis on ``empathy and humanity'' will build loyalty. Pilot
programs being tested at the company include ``permission'' for
employees not to answer their voice mail and e-mail over weekends
and while on vacation, and ``utilization committees'' that monitor
employee overtime and redistribute work when the total workload
consistently registers more than 50 to 55 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the straightforward problem of retention, corporations
are motivated by a growing body of research that shows that working
long hours over long periods is not necessarily cost-effective.
Mindy Fried of the Center for Work and Family at Boston College has
been trying to quantify how much money companies lose because of
the errors and additional medical claims that result from overly
long hours. ``The research is pretty clear that as people work over
a certain number of hours, productivity goes down, stress goes up,
and work isn't as good,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   SAS Institute Inc. in North Carolina is a privately held
software company that has experienced double-digit sales growth for
two decades. It is also something of a workers' paradise, where
full-time employees, starting with the chief executive officer, Jim
Goodknight, clock in for just 35 hours a week. The company
switchboard shuts down at 5 p.m., and the main gate is shut an hour
later. Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor at Stanford Business School,
recently studied SAS, which is based in Cary, outside Raleigh. He
concluded that not only does the company save tens of millions of
dollars each year because its turnover rate is a fraction of the
industry average, but it also gains by having more alert, less
error-prone programmers.
</P>
<P>
   David Russo, SAS' vice president for human resources, says that
five years ago competitors considered the company's 40-hour work
week freakish and impractical, but ``in the last two years, we've
had 20 companies _ some really big companies _ come down and study
what we're doing here.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, intense pressure to stay on the technological
cutting edge and to maintain high growth rates has made 16-hour
days a norm. But after years of trying to entice programmers with
idiosyncratic benefits like gourmet kitchens and pet-friendly
office spaces, some companies are beginning to create a work pace
that is more sustainable over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   John Gage, the chief engineer at Sun Microsystems, a
manufacturer of workstations and compatible software, describes his
programmers as ``lone poets'' who get so involved in their work
that they often will not leave their screens until the company
pries them away. To sway these workaholics, Sun, which is based in
Palo Alto, Calif., has developed an informal buddy system under
which programmers monitor each other. ``That way, if someone
disappears into his office for a few days, someone will go rescue
him,'' Gage explains. The company has also hired a slew of what he
euphemistically calls ``get-a-life'' counselors, whose job it is to
coach code writers on the joys of the real world _ sunlight, bike
riding, children.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the hours backlash limited to professional and managerial
employees. Unions say that reducing mandatory overtime has become
increasingly important to their members. The United Auto Workers
has made it one of the pillars of its official negotiating
platform, proclaiming that ``heavy and steady overtime work can
lead to depression, fatigue and confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Communication Workers of America went on strike
against US West until the telephone company agreed to a pay raise
and to cut mandatory overtime in half, to a maximum of eight hours
a week, by January 2001. Mike ``Ice'' Withrow, vice president of
CWA Local 7777 in Englewood, Colo., said the time-and-a-half
compensation did not make up for the fact that members felt ``they
didn't have a life.''
</P>
<P>
   Victories at US West and experiments at progressive employers
like Hewlett-Packard aside, many workplace experts say they are
seeing a lot more talk than action. Jeremy Rifkin, author of ``The
End of Work,'' laments, ``We still have too many employers who have
bought the idea that the only way you get ahead is by chaining your
workers to their chairs until they drop.''
</P>
<P>
   Sue Meisinger, senior vice president of the Society of Human
Resource Managers, says that the same tight labor market that makes
companies consider reducing hours also makes them pile on the work.
After all, the job has to get done somehow. ``Companies see the
problem, but they don't know how to fix it,'' she says. ``There is
plenty of wringing of hands, but if an employee goes on vacation
and there is an emergency, you will call him.'' The only difference
now? The company will ``feel guilty'' about the intrusion.

 &HT;    Gore leads search for Georgia money
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the first three months of the year, Vice
President Gore raised nearly as much money in Georgia for his 2000
presidential bid as the entire field of Republican hopefuls, a
computer-assisted analysis of Federal Election Commission reports
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Gore led the money chase in Georgia with $209,025, drawing
heavily on lawyers and business leaders who supported President
Clinton in 1992 and 1996. He was followed by Texas Gov. George W.
Bush with $88,564 and Elizabeth Dole with $55,250.
</P>
<P>
   Because so many large states have shifted their presidential
primaries to early part of next year, candidates are under enormous
pressure to raise a lot of money early. Georgia's March primary now
falls relatively late in the process, but the state's concentration
of businesses and wealthy donors put it high on the candidates'
list for generating contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty percent of all the donations raised in Georgia came from
just 10 ZIP codes in and around the northern suburbs of metro
Atlanta. The top giving zip code was 30327 in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush, the GOP front-runner, raised less than Gore in
Georgia, the figures are somewhat misleading. While Gore began
raising money in January, Bush started in March. Bush raised nearly
all of his money in a two-week blitz beginning March 17, drawing on
a network of contributors who were longtime supporters of his
father, former President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The speed at which Bush was able to generate so many
contributions suggests that the Texas Republican is well organized
in Georgia and has the potential to raise significant sums in the
Peach state.
</P>
<P>
   The first-quarter financial reports also reflected a strong
showing of support for conservative activist Gary Bauer. Bauer
raised $33,100, third most behind Bush and Dole among Republicans,
and well ahead of the other GOP hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   Those results may indicate that Bauer, who founded the Family
Research Council in Washington and is a former Ronald Reagan
staffer, has the early lead in the battle to win conservative votes
in Georgia. Former Vice President Dan Quayle, publisher Steve
Forbes and commentator Pat Buchanan also are vying for the
conservative vote in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   But none of those candidates drummed up much financial support.
Quayle raised only $5,725 and Forbes $2,000; Buchanan did not file
a first-quarter report. A fund-raiser for Quayle in Atlanta last
week reportedly raised $25,000 for the former vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who is targeting many of the same
moderate Republican voters as Bush and Dole, raised $9,500 in
Georgia, $5,000 of which came from BellSouth's political action
committee.
</P>
<P>
   While it is still early in the fund-raising contest, the first
reports tell much about the candidates' support. The first
contributors are usually part of a candidates' inner circle of
supporters _ or those who want to make a statement of loyalty
early.
</P>
<P>
   Some are personal friends of the candidates. Some give even
though they know that their candidate may not win.
</P>
<P>
   Former Atlanta City Councilman Richard Guthman met Dole more
than 20 years ago on a State Department Exchange trip. ``I was most
impressed by her intelligence, her personality, her strength and
determination,'' said Guthman, who gave Dole $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Guthman said he knows Bush is the GOP favorite but noted that
``strange things happen in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Blue, president of Ronald Blue and Co., met Bauer at a
conference in Montana 15 years ago and the two became friends.
Bauer tapped Blue to be his national finance chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if Gary will prevail or not, but I think he will
run a very credible campaign,'' Blue said. ``I wouldn't say to
people that he is going to win, but I would say let's give him a
chance to get his message out.''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.), who is a member of
Bush's exploratory committee, Bush reached into the network of
contributors who helped elect his father to the White House in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   Some donors said they contributed to Bush even though they don't
know much about what he stands for.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Guy, a retired Atlanta businessman and a World War II
comrade of the former president, said he received a phone call from
the Bush campaign and quickly wrote checks for a $1,000 from both
he and his wife. ``I don't know him all that well, but I know he's
a good man,'' said Guy said of the younger Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Gray, president of Gray Ventures in Atlanta, said he got
the pitch from his brother, C. Boyden Gray, President Bush's former
White House lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of pressure,'' said Gray. ``I don't know who
organized it, but it was a national effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also received help from about a dozen lawyers at Troutman
Sanders who contributed $5,500.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who comes to Atlanta for his first big Georgia fund-raiser
May 24, raised more than $45,000 from senior executives at
BellSouth, the telecommunications giant.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also picked up contributions from former Democratic Party
Chairman Ed Sims and AFLAC president Daniel Amos. Former Gov. Zell
Miller also gave Gore $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Seydel, an executive with the Seydel Companies, said he
jumped into help Gore because of the vice president's commitment to
the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it as an expansion of what the Clinton
administration has done for the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Georgians opted to give to more than one candidate. Former
Coca-Cola president Donald Keough gave to both former Sen. Bill
Bradley and to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Failed GOP gubernatorial nominee Guy Millner contributed $1,000
to former Gov. Lamar Alexander, who raised money for Millner in
each of his three statewide campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Millner's wife, Ginny, gave $1,000 to Dole.

POSSIBLE REGGIE LEWIS DRUG USE AT ISSUE AS TRIAL OPENS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- As the malpractice trial stemming from the death of
Celtics star Reggie Lewis began Monday, attorneys for Lewis' widow
claimed that allegations of cocaine use by the Lewis are irrelevant
to the case, while a lawyer for one of the three cardiologists
being sued countered that it's the very core.
</P>
<P>
   Concealing such information would be the same as showing up in a
doctor's office with a stomach ache and failing to tell him you'd
just eaten ``a two-week-old meatloaf,'' said attorney William F.
Dailey Jr.,, who represents Dr. Gilbert Mudge, the cardiologist
whom Donna Harris-Lewis has accused of failing to diagnose her
husband's deadly heart condition.
</P>
<P>
   But attorney Robert G. Harley, who represents Harris-Lewis, said
allegations of drug use are immaterial, as well as false. Lewis's
doctors, he said, were responsible for providing top-qualty care
regardless of the cause of his heart condition.
</P>
<P>
   The first witness to testify Monday, Dr. Gerald Miley, a New
England Baptist internist who examined Lewis after he blacked out
during an April 1993 playoff game, said he asked Lewis three times
if he had used cocaine, and each time Lewis answered that he had
not.
</P>
<P>
   Miley said he ``took at face value'' Lewis's assurance that he
had not used cocaine because, ``I had no reason not to believe
him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dailey, in his opening statement to jurors in Suffolk
Superior Court, said Lewis had ``great motivation'' to hide any
ilegal drug use since disclosure would have nullified the balance
of his $9 million contract with the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   Miley, the initial witness called by Harris-Lewis's lawyers,
said that based on his review of tests conducted on Lewis, he
believed the 27-year-old suffered from a possibly life-threatening
heart abnormality, one that Harley claimed was treatable, if
properly diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had Reggie gotten a defibrillator, we wouldn't be here
today,'' Harley said in his opening statement. ``As a result of not
having that defibrillator, we all lost one of the finest young men
of his generation.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Mudge, Harris-Lewis has sued two other
physicians, Peter L. Friedman and Mark A. Creager, accusing them of
misdiagnosing her husband's heart condition. Harris-Lewis -- who
sat quietly in the front row of the spectator gallery, flanked by
acquaintances -- agreed to settle last week with a fourth doctor,
Dr. John Rutherford, now in practice in Texas. Details of the
settlement have not been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge says he could not accurately diagnose Lewis's condition
because Lewis withheld information on his cocaine use until two
weeks before he collapsed and died while shooting baskets at
Brandeis University on July 27, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis had sought a second opinion from Mudge after a team of
doctors at New England Baptist Hospital chosen by the Celtics
diagnosed Lewis with arrhythmia, a potentially life-threatening
defect that could end his career.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis then consulted with Mudge, one of Boston's most respected
cardiologists, at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge concluded that Lewis suffered from a neurological disorder
that caused fainting spells. With proper treatment, he said, Lewis
could return to basketball. Three months later, Lewis died while
shooting baskets in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   The state medical examiner listed the cause of death as
adenovirus 2, a virus that could have caused inflammation of the
heart, tissue scarring and, ultimately, death.
</P>
<P>
   Dailey suggested to jurors that Lewis had ignored doctors'
orders to restrict his physical activity to stretching,
weightlifting and tai chi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Lewis was told before he went out the door at Brigham and
Women's Hospital that he was not to exercise without having a
(heart) monitor in place,'' said Dailey, adding that a witness will
testify she saw Lewis ``glistening with sweat'' while shooting
baskets after his discharge.
</P>
<P>
   While the trial, which is expected to last four weeks, will
focus on whether Mudge and his two co-defendants at Brigham and
Women's Hospital made misjudgments that resulted in Lewis's death,
Monday's proceedings made clear that alleged cocaine use by Lewis
will be a key issue.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Harris-Lewis tried unsuccessfully to bar any mention
of alleged drug use from the trial, arguing that the issue had been
raised ``for the sole purpose of trashing'' Lewis's reputation.

MIREYA MOSCOSO: PANAMANIAN PRESIDENT PLEDGES FIGHT AGAINST POVERTY
AND UNEMPLOYMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY _ For more than 20 years, Mireya Elisa Moscoso lived
in the shadow of a man 45 years her senior who, she says, even told
her how to wear her hair.
</P>
<P>
   But by the side of that man, her late husband and Panama's
three-time president, Arnulfo Arias, she also gained a political
schooling that on Sunday helped transform her into ``Senora
Presidenta,'' the first woman to become president of this country
of 2.8 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The triumph of Senora Mireya is a triumph for the Panamanian
woman,'' said Kaiser Bazan, one of two vice presidental candidates
on the Arnulfista Party's winning ticket, at an impromptu victory
rally Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Moscoso, 52, became one of Latin America's first female
presidents in what many Panamanians regarded as the most important
election in the country's short history. Her administration will
oversee the transfer of the Panama Canal from United States to
Panamanian control this year under treaties signed in 1977. She
will also preside over the withdrawal of American troops for the
first time since Panama was carved out of Colombia in 1903 in a
move engineered by the Americans in order to build the waterway.
</P>
<P>
   Moscoso said in an interview last week that her goal for the
canal is to insure that ``users feel that it is as well taken care
of as when it was with the United States.'' But throughout the
election campaign, in which she defeated two other candidates,
including the son of Gen. Omar Torrijos, the strongman who ruled
Panama after the military coup that deposed her husband in 1968,
Moscoso said her first priority would be to tackle poverty, which
affects more than a third of the population, and the country's 12
percent jobless rate.
</P>
<P>
   She also wants to slow the pace of such economic reforms as the
privatization of state-owned utilities and has promised an end to
corruption and nepotism in the government, which she takes over
from the Revolutionary Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't forget my roots or my commitment to fight
unemployment, poverty and its consequences,'' she said Sunday night
after winning with 44 percent of the vote. ``I want for his country
what I want for my son, Ricardo _ that he have the right to grow up
in a democratic country, with guaranteed freedoms, with judicial
stability and with social justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscoso was born to a rural family of six children that sank
into poverty with the death of her father, a schoolteacher, when
she was 10. She was 17 and working as a secretary after graduating
from high school when she first met Arnulfo Arias, at a friend's
birthday party in the early 1960s. Arias was a 62-year-old widower
and physician who had already been president twice, only to be
ousted both times by political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a man with a lot of character who I felt loved me, and I
fell madly in love,'' Moscoso said in an interview last week at her
party headquarters, in a office with walls full of black-and-white
photographs of Arias. ``He adapted me to him completely: he told me
how I was going to wear my hair, how I was going to talk. He had a
very strong personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscoso worked in his presidential campaigns and in the coffee
business she has managed, along with 300 employees, since Arias'
death in 1988. In 1968, after Arias was removed from the presidency
for a third time, in a military coup, she joined him in exile in
the United States, where she married him the next year and remained
until he died in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   A later marriage ended in divorce after five years. She has a
7-year-old adopted son.
</P>
<P>
   Moscoso said she initially rebuffed requests by her husband's
supporters to carry on his work. But in 1990 she coordinated the
creation of the Arnulfista Party to replace her husband's old
party. And in 1991 she took over as party president, in order, she
said, to keep it out of the hands of people wanting to use it ``for
their own personal convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1994, when she first ran for president and came in second,
the small, fragile-looking woman had emerged as Panama's main
opposition leader and the self-described ``voice of the people.''
She took on the Revolutionary Democratic Party, which had ruled
Panama with a succession of military governments through the 1970s
and 1980s and yielded power to the Arnulfistas only from 1990 to
1994, accusing it of neglecting the poor while enriching those in
power and warning of the threat of ``another PRI,'' a reference to
the political party that has dominated Mexico through most of this
century.
</P>
<P>
   Many Panamanians, however, cited her lack of a college degree
(she studied interior design at Miami-Dade Community College) and
the possibility that she might be easily manipulated as major
drawbacks. And not everyone remembered Arias with fondness.
Although the late president had created a social security system,
strengthened labor laws and gave women the vote, his views included
a curious mix of fascism (and connections to Italy in the 1940s for
which the United States encouraged one of the military coups
against him), racism, mysticism and nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   During her campaign, Moscoso downplayed her educational
shortcomings, saying, ``My biggest university was that of Dr.
Arias.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I often think of Ronald Reagan, who surrounded himself with
the best advisers and was an excellent president,'' she said in the
interview. ``I can do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   She called sexism an even bigger obstacle to her political
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although they say Mireya doesn't have the capacity,'' she
screamed to tens of thousands of supporters at her closing campaign
rally, ``although they say that because she is a woman she can't be
president, I tell you here, I can wear pants just like the men in
this country. And I know when to put on skirts and when to put on
pants too.''
</P>
<P>
   (This prompted Martin Torrijos, her main opponent in the race,
to quipp: ``Now we know what she meant when she talks about change
_ a change of clothes.'')
</P>
<P>
   Now many Panamanians look to her to fully exploit the economic
potential of the Panama Canal property, worth an estimated $4
billion, for the average Panamanian, and distribute the riches
fairly. For that she will have to contend with a 72-seat unicameral
legislature dominated by opposition parties, which won a majority
of seats in Sunday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``She comes from way below,'' said Ronald Luque, a 25-year-old
waiter attending one of her rallies, referring to her humble
beginnings. ``The hope is that someone who came from below will
help more.''

LITTLETON MAN FACES GUN-SALE CHARGE IN MASS SHOOTING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ A 22-year-old local man who once attended
Columbine High School was arrested Monday for allegedly supplying
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold with a semi-automatic handgun, one of
the four guns used in the school rampage, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark E. Manes will be charged with providing a handgun to a
minor, a felony under Colorado law punishable by two to six years
in prison and a fine up to $500,000, said Steve Davis, spokesman
for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
   Manes was the first person arrested in direct connection with
the April 20 massacre that killed 15 people, including the gunmen.
A girlfriend of Klebold's who gave the gunmen two shotguns and one
rifle remains under investigation, authorities said, but is not
considered a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Manes allegedly gave, traded or sold a TEC DC-9 semi-automatic
handgun to either one or both gunmen while they were under 18 years
old. Klebold died at 17; Harris turned 18 on April 9, 11 days
before the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said police had not yet determined whether Manes knew what
Harris and Klebold were planning. Such knowledge could turn the
charge into an ``aggravated'' offense, punishable under Colorado
law by up to 12 years in prison, local prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Manes were unsuccessful, but his lawyer said
Manes had no idea what Harris and Klebold had in store.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was horrified when he heard what happened,'' attorney
Robert Ransome said in an interview. ``He did not know it was going
to happen, and the evidence will show that to be the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Ransome said Manes was introduced to Harris and Klebold through
a mutual friend who worked with the two gunmen at the Blackjack
Pizza parlor in Littleton. The lawyer said Manes was not a friend
of either gunman and had no other dealings with them.
</P>
<P>
   Ransome said Manes was not a licensed gun dealer but declined to
say where he is employed. He said Manes's only previous offense was
possession of drug paraphernalia as a juvenile. ``He's been clean a
long time. He's a decent young man,'' Ransome said. He said Manes
attended Columbine but did not know if he graduated from the
school.
</P>
<P>
   Manes was released on $15,000 bond pending a May 10 court
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said authorities were still working to determine if any of
the murder victims was killed with the TEC DC-9, a weapon whose
manufacture was banned under the 1994 Brady Bill. Sales of existing
weapons are permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Mauser, father of slain student Daniel Mauser, said at an
antigun rally Saturday that his son was killed with the TEC DC-9.
Davis said he did not know what led Mauser to that conclusion.
Attempts to reach Mauser Monday were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   The TEC DC-9 used in the Columbine killings traveled
cross-country in the five years since it was manufactured in Miami
by the gunmaker Intratec. First, it was purchased by Zander
Sporting Goods, an Illinois firearms wholesaler. From there, it
went to a Denver-area store called Just Guns. When that store went
out of business, the owner gave it to a friend, Larry Russell, to
sell on consignment at a Colorado gun show.
</P>
<P>
   Russell has said he did not know the name of the person to whom
he sold the gun, but said he would not have sold it to anyone under
age 18.
</P>
<P>
   Because Russell was not a licensed dealer at the time, no
background check or other gun control measures had to be followed.
That exemption from the law, described by gun control advocates as
a dangerous loophole, has become a focus of legislative discussion
on state and federal levels in the wake of the Columbine shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he did not know whether Manes purchased the gun from
Russell or from someone else. He also said he did not know exactly
when Russell allegedly provided it to the gunmen, or whether it was
given to Harris, Klebold or both.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the only other arrest related to the rampage involved a
hardware store clerk who allegedly lied about having sold Harris
and Klebold propane tanks, nails and other materials they used to
build more than 50 bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Police have not ruled out the possibility of more arrests,
though Davis said no suspects are being sought.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've always, from day one, had a feeling that there had to
be some people who had some knowledge or helped them plan or build
some of these bombs,'' Davis said. ``I think they're still leaning
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Klebold's girlfriend, Robyn Anderson, might not face charges
because it is not illegal under Colorado or federal law for a
person without a criminal record to give minors long guns such as
rifles or shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the county coroner's office confirmed that Harris's
body contained the prescription drug Luvox, which is used to help
control obsessive-compulsive disorder. Pharmaceutical specialists
have said they do not believe the drug played a role in the
killings.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the carpenter who erected 15 wooden crosses atop a
hill near the high school removed the 13 remaining crosses. Two of
the crosses _ memorials to the gunmen _ already were torn down by
the father of one of the shooting victims. The carpenter said he
had grown tired of the criticism he received for building 15
crosses.

FINANCIAL REFORM BILL FACES CRA STUMBLING BLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Bruce Marks won a four-year campaign to force
Fleet Financial Group Inc. to provide more low-income and
inner-city loans, he marked the event with a characteristic
flourish. At a US Capitol press conference attended by senators and
Fleet officials, the Boston-based Marks produced a large,
papier-mache hatchet and symbolically buried it in a coffin.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than five years later, a prominent senator has dug up
that old hatchet _ and is preparing to use it against Marks
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 deal between Marks and Fleet could become a focal point
in Senator Phil Gramm's campaign to scale back the Community
Reinvestment Act, a 22-year-old federal law that coaxes banks to
make loans in low-income and minority neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, a Texas Republican and chairman of the Senate's banking
committee, is expected to shift his campaign into high gear
starting Tuesday. If the schedule goes as planned, he will bring to
the Senate floor a massive overhaul of the Depression-era laws that
have prevented banks, insurance companies, and securities firms
from entering each other's lines of business.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken two decades to array banks, insurers, brokerages,
regulators, and lawmakers behind a single bill that, if passed,
would create new ``financial supermarkets'' that sell everything
from checking accounts to mutual funds and life insurance.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few sticking points is how the new law would affect
the Community Reinvestment Act, known as the CRA.
</P>
<P>
   Under the CRA, bank regulators study the lending practices of
banks to see if they loan money in the lower-income and minority
communities in which they have offices. The goal is to force banks
to look for lending opportunities in those communities.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm and his allies want to scale back the act, saying it
imposes a heavy regulatory burden on banks. Moreover, Gramm has
said, the CRA puts banks at the mercy of community groups that
threaten to try to block bank mergers unless the banks pony up cash
payments and guarantees for more for low-income loans.
</P>
<P>
   The CRA has become ``a system of legalized extortion,'' Gramm
has said. It is used to ``extract bribes and kickbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator so far has not named names of the ``gangsters''
allegedly abusing the CRA, but a Capitol Hill source said that his
office has made poster-sized copies of provisions from the 1994
Marks agreement with Fleet. Gramm might display those posters on
the Senate floor when he introduces the financial services bill, or
maybe use them during floor debate in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Marks, in a phone interview, said that the Republican staff of
the Senate banking committee had asked Fleet to provide details of
its deal with Marks's group, the Neighborhood Assistance Corp. of
America. Fleet Monday declined to comment. ``I don't know if the
senator will call him by name, but he is certainly aware of Mr.
Marks and how his group has profited from the CRA,'' said Christi
Harlan, a spokesman for Gramm.
</P>
<P>
   Harlan said Gramm is most concerned about community groups that
demand ``cash payments'' from banks on top of the commitments to
make loans to traditionally underserved groups.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 deal with Fleet committed $140 million in loan money to
be administered by the Neighborhood Assistance Corp. According to a
congressional source, Marks's group receives payments equal to 2.75
percent of the loans it administers. The source said Gramm might
highlight that feature of the deal as an example of how groups
abuse the CRA to extract payments from banks.
</P>
<P>
   Marks would not confirm the size of the payments but said banks
pay his group for a wide variety of loan services it renders.
</P>
<P>
   Marks's deals with Fleet and other banks compel them to loan
money to qualified first-time homeowners at competitive rates,
without requiring a down payment or closing costs. The deals set
other terms, such as a rule that banks consider a borrower's credit
only over the previous 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   The Neighborhood Assistance Corp. holds seminars on home-buying
for low-income people, offers financial counseling, and helps them
navigate the minefield of the mortgage application process. It also
counsels people once they've bought a home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a fee for services, and we don't get enough for all the
work that we do,'' Marks said. Marks said he is paid $85,000 a year
as executive director of the association, which now has 16 offices,
more than 100 staff members and manages $3.7 billion in loan
commitments from banks across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Marks said he was ``thrilled to death'' by the prospect that his
group could become ``Phil Gramm's poster child.'' Gramm, he said,
``doesn't want middle-income, first-time homebuyers to be able to
purchase a home _ and that position can't survive the light of
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the CRA is credited with guiding banks to loan more
than $1 trillion to homebuyers and businesses. ``With the CRA, our
neighborhoods have a chance of developing,'' said Wade Henderson,
executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.
``Without it they are victimized and discriminated against.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Gramm's bill, rural banks with less than $100 million in
assets would be exempt from the CRA. Banks with a ``satisfactory''
rating for CRA compliance would find it easier to win federal
approval for mergers and new branch offices. Gramm also opposes a
measure that requires banks to maintain a ``satisfactory'' rating
for CRA compliance before they can expand into the insurance or
brokerage businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm scuttled the financial services overhaul last year because
lawmakers did not accept his changes to the CRA. President Clinton
has vowed to veto the bill this year if Gramm's CRA language
remains. A House committee is considering companion legislation
that does not significantly curtail the CRA.

   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Broadening the scope of its air strikes,
NATO on Monday attacked Yugoslavia's electrical system, cutting off
power to millions of civilians as well as military units in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said the aim of the attacks, which plunged
Belgrade into darkness Monday for several hours, is to disrupt
military communications, command centers and air defense systems.
Making their combat debut, special bombs containing strands of
carbon were used to short-circuit Yugoslavia's electrical
transformers without destroying them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the attacks have crossed a new threshold, spurring
questions about whether the alliance is striking strictly military
targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that lights went out across 70 percent of the country
shows that NATO has its finger on the light switch now,'' said NATO
spokesman Jamie Shea. ``We can turn the power off whenever we need
to and whenever we want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Having deferred serious consideration of using ground troops,
the alliance is relying on bombing attacks as its main source of
pressure on Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic. And in recent
days it has expanded both the range of its targets and the
intensity of its strikes.
</P>
<P>
   NATO warplanes are flying more low-level bombing raids against
Yugoslav forces in Kosovo, a tactic that until now had been ruled
out as too dangerous, Pentagon officials said today. The
lower-altitude runs, coupled with strikes against a wider array of
targets, a spell of clearer weather and a stepped-up Yugoslav
defense, has greatly increased the risk to allied pilots. Last
weekend three NATO fighter-bombers were hit by ground fire. One of
them crashed.
</P>
<P>
   In attacking electrical power stations, NATO officials insisted
Monday's attacks would not cut electricity to hospitals and other
vital civilian services since they could turn to back-up
generators, powered by diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they conceded that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
might soon face a choice: whether to use limited fuel supplies to
run the generators for civilian service or devote that fuel to the
military.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize the inconvenience that may be caused to the
Yugoslav people, but it up to Milosevic to decide how he wants to
use his remaining energy resources: on his tanks or on his
people,'' said Jamie Shea, the NATO spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO sought to downplay the effect of the strikes on
civilians, the raids have already stirred debate.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the latest attacks on the electrical systems will
not do lasting damage to Serbian forces since military command and
control systems are likely to be restarted again once the graphite
is swept up and the transformers restarted.
</P>
<P>
   But if the attacks are repeated, critics say, they may force the
shut down of plants for water purification and sewage treatment,
and hospitals, undercutting NATO assertion that it is not at war
with the Yugoslav people, and undermining public support for the
allied military campaign in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take a consistent effort to take out the national
electrical grid,'' said William Arkin, a military consultant to
Human Rights Watch. ``That would have an onerous effect on
civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on Yugoslavia's electrical system were directed at
five large installations that distribute power, including one at
Obrenovac, which transfers power to Western Serbia and a
transformer at Nis, which NATO says provides power to the Yugoslav
3rd Army in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Other electrical transformers that were attacked are located at
Bajina Basta, Drmno, Novi Sad.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials emphasized that allied planes had not destroyed
the installations. Instead, they dropped ``soft bombs'' that spewed
strands of graphite, short-circuiting the electrical transmission
equipment. It was as if the transmission equipment had been hit by
a lightening strike.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon declined to give details about the new bomb, saying
it was highly classified. A similar technique, however, was used
during the 1991 Persian Gulf war when sea-launched cruise missiles
carrying spools of carbon filament were fired at Iraq's electrical
grid.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity has long been one of the most politically sensitive
of targets. Early in the Persian Gulf war, Iraq's electrical system
was attacked and experts still debate the military usefulness of
the raids and their effects on Iraqi civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Allied war planners insisted those attacks on the Iraqi
electrical grid were needed to hamper Iraq's air defenses,
especially during the initial stages of that air campaign. While
many Iraqi military units had back-up generators, switching to them
would be disruptive and that would help protect allied pilots, the
planners reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the caution with which NATO diplomats have overseen
the gradual escalation of the air campaign against Yugoslavia,
however, attacks against electrical transformers and distribution
centers have not taken place until the sixth week of bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they insisted Monday that they were needed to disrupt
military communications systems, hamper military headquarters and
interfere with air defense systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Command and control or a computer in military hands without
electricity simply becomes a mass of metal, wire and plastic,''
Shea said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman declined to say whether the strikes would be
carried out regularly, but they suggested that they would need to
be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   They also indicated that they wanted to minimize the effect on
civilians. Because Yugoslavia's electrical grid provides power to
neighboring countries, NATO also does not want to completely
disable it, according to NATO's military spokesman, German Maj.
Gen. Walter Jertz.
</P>
<P>
   Jertz said that Yugoslav authorities had restored much of the
electricity in a matter of hours. Reports from Belgrade Monday
night, however, indicated that many people were spending a second
night without electricity. State television was of the air and
traffic lights were not operating.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's strikes on electricity was not the only difficult
question NATO faced Monday. Serb television alleged that allied
warplanes had bombed a bus full of civilians on the road between
Pec and Rozage in Montenegro. One report quoted officials in
Montenegro as saying 17 people were killed and 21 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesmen said that they did not have any information on
the incident.

BAY STATE CRACKS DOWN ON N.J.-BASED DAY TRADER

<P>
   BOSTON -- In its campaign to clamp down on rogue day-trading
firms, Massachusetts securities regulators say New Jersey-based
All-Tech Investment Group has agreed to not reopen its
Massachusetts branch for two years and pay a $50,000 fine to the
state.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement ``sends a clear message'' to day-trading firms,
said Matt Nester, director of securities for the Massachusetts
securities division.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is obviously a highly speculative, highly risky form of
trading,'' he said Monday. ``Firms have to disclose risk or there
are going to be consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Day-trading is an exploding form of stock-market trading that
has little to do with investment. Rather, traders buy and sell
stocks, sometimes hundreds of times a day, betting on miniscule
movements in price. Dozens of firms, including All-Tech, have
sprung up across the country to cater to them. Viewing day-trading
as little more than gambling, Massachusetts regulators led a
nationwide crackdown against firms that appeared to exploit
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   All-Tech closed its branch in Watertown in November, shortly
before state regulators brought charges alleging a wide range of
abuses. They included forgery, deceptive marketing, trading
customer accounts without authorization, creating phony accounts,
and misleading regulators.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's settlement, All-Tech neither admitted nor denied the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just happy it's over,'' said Neal Sullivan, an
All-Tech attorney. ``There was a bad office manager in that branch
who has been terminated for his activities. They just want to get
out of the line of fire and run a repectable business.''

SENATE BEGINS DEBATE ON KOSOVO CONFLICT

   WASHINGTON _ Nearly six weeks after the air war in Yugoslavia
began, the Senate took up debate on Monday over authorizing
President Clinton to use all means necessary to win NATO's fight
for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan resolution was championed by Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., and presidential aspirant, who said the Senate had to
encourage the president ``to wage this war more effectively than he
has done thus far.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he does not, the shame is on him,'' McCain said. ``If we
lose this war, the entire country and the world will suffer the
consequences. Yes, the president would leave office with yet
another mark against him. But he will not suffer that indignity
alone. We will all be less secure. We will all be dishonored.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution appeared to be doomed by opposition from the
Senate's leadership and was likely to be shelved on Tuesday
morning, its supporters said. The majority leader, Trent Lott of
Mississippi, postponed a scheduled vote on Monday night after
McCain criticized a four-hour limit on debate.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``a debate that many did not want and few will mind
seeing disposed of quickly,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly frustrated, McCain, a former Navy aviator who was shot
down over Vietnam and held prisoner for seven years, said senators
had ``allowed American pilots and possibly American soldiers to
risk their lives for a cause that we will not risk our careers
for.''
</P>
<P>
   He called on senators who believed ``that this war is not worth
the cost in blood and treasure necessary to win it'' to stand up
and vote to cut off the funds to fight it.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's leadership had little desire for a vote on McCain's
resolution, with its clear call for the use of ground troops if
necessary to achieve victory in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Their enthusiasm was extinguished last week when a contentious
House, in a tie vote, rejected a measure offering political support
for the air war and simultaneously voted against withdrawing
American forces from the battle. Many in the Senate, and some in
the House, thought that vote sent at best a mixed message and at
worst a sign of aid and comfort to President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Senate vented some of its own deeply divided
opinions about the fight for over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the resolution came from across the Senate's
political spectrum. ``What Senator McCain's resolution does is give
our president carte blanche,'' said Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio.
``We should not give the president blanket authority to get us into
another Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said the resolution's language
would authorize the United States to use ``every weapon known to
mankind'' against Serbian forces, including ``chemical, biological
and nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Support for the resolution also crossed party lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now weeks into an air campaign that may last months,
and Americans need to prepare themselves now, psychologically at
least, for war,'' said Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., a co-sponsor of
the resolution. ``We can't wait to see how it turns out before we
risk taking a stand.''
</P>
<P>
   In pointed contrast to House Republicans, many of whom are
calling the fighting ``Clinton's war,'' McCain said it was
``America's war.'' In the same vein, Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.,
attacked the idea that ``this is President Clinton's war, and when
he falls flat on his face, that's his problem.'' He said, ``If the
president needs shoring up, that may be our job.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Dow Jones industrial average's charge above
11,000 on Monday was led by formerly stodgy stocks sensitive to the
business cycle while money moved out of technology shares,
continuing a trend that has been in place for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial giants like Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing and
General Motors received a lift from a report from the nation's
purchasing managers indicating that the economy was growing with
little pressure for higher interest rates and that export markets
were reviving.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a whole new team of horses that are leading this
thing,'' said Ralph Acampora, head of technical analysis at
Prudential Securities. ``Five weeks ago, when the market first
closed above 10,000, the leadership was different. Money rushing
into a whole new set of stocks has lifted off a whole new bull
market.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow, which first closed above 10,000 on March 29, gained
225.65 points on Monday, to 11,014.69. So far this year, it is up
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which hit a record last
week but trails the Dow's performance this year, gained 19.45
points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,354.63. More than 400 stocks in the
index rose, while 82 fell.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for many investors, among the S&AMP;P 500's losers
were stocks like Microsoft, America Online and EMC, three issues
that have been standard-bearers for the entire market. Microsoft
fell 1 7/16, to 79 7/8; America Online slumped 9 3/4, to 133 1/8,
and EMC dropped 1 15/16, to 107.
</P>
<P>
   Selling in technology was not confined to those issues. The
Nasdaq composite index fell 7.27 points, or three-tenths of a
percent, to 2,535.58. And the Internet stock index compiled by
Thestreet.com slumped 23.29 points, or 3.6 percent, to 632.97.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet decline was led by Amazon.com, which tumbled 21
1/8, to 150 15/16, and Yahoo, which fell 12 1/8, to 162 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Cyclical stocks had another excellent day, and the Dow Jones
transportation average hit a record. The Morgan Stanley index of 30
cyclical stocks jumped 15.88 points, to 612.62, a new high. And the
transportation average climbed 49.3 points, or 1.35 percent, to
3,696.59.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 30 stocks in the Dow industrials, roughly half are
cyclicals, companies with fortunes closely tied to changes in the
domestic and global economic cycle. Among them, Minnesota Mining
and General Motors led the index higher. 3M gained 4 7/8, to 93
7/8, and GM rose 4 11/16, to 93 3/4. Goodyear Tire and Rubber, one
of the Dow's worst performers last year, gained 3 9/16, to 60 3/4.

 &HT;    Cyclicals drive the Dow past 11,000
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 11,000 on Monday,
just over a month after topping a historic 10,000, as favorable
economic news attracted intense investor interest in cyclical
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new bull market,'' said Prudential Securities chief
technical analyst Ralph Acampora, who said he expects to raise his
current Dow target of 11,500 in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole new team of horses leading the market,''
Acampora said in a conference call with financial reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the recent shift of buyer interest to
so-called cyclical, or economically sensitive, stocks that
typically outperform the market during periods of strong economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
   That was certainly the case Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Winning Dow cyclicals included General Motors, which rose $4.63
3/4 to $93.75; Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, $4.87 1/2 to
$93.87 1/2; Goodyear Tire, $3.56 1/4 to $60.75; International
Paper, $2.06 1/4 to $55.37 1/2; and Union Carbide, $3.50 to $48.37
1/2.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Dow reversed Friday's loss with a steady,
daylong climb to a new high of 11,014.69.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow made history March 28 when it closed for the first time
over 10,000 _ a feat that took almost a year from its 9,000 close
on April 6, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The strong performance of cyclical stocks this far into an
economic expansion _ eight years _ is unusual, because they tend to
perform best in the early stages of a business cycle.
</P>
<P>
   But these stocks are being propelled by continued favorable
economic news, such as last week's report that the economy grew at
a bigger-than-expected 4.5 percent annual rate in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing stocks surged Monday after the National
Association of Purchasing Management reported its index of
manufacturing activity remained above a reading of 50 percent,
signifying expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The index actually fell 1.5 percentage points, which was also
favorably received as an anti-inflationary move.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the money going into the typically undervalued
stocks of the Dow and other Big Board issues is coming out of the
market's previous group of leaders, especially technology stocks
and, within that sector, the Internets.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the only loser among major stock indexes on Monday
was the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index, which fell 0.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The recent sell-off in once-highflying Internet stocks continued
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said major players such as America Online, Amazon.com
and eBay are giving back some of their recent gains after posting
better-than-expected first-quarter results last week.
</P>
<P>
   Acampora said he expects to revise his Dow forecast shortly but
declined to speculate on what it will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we would get to 11,500 later in the year,'' he said.
``So I have to go back to drawing board. As we get closer to
11,500, I will raise the target.''

 &HT;    ETrade moving jobs to suburban Atlanta
 &HT;    By Cheryl Crabb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ETrade Group Inc. plans to add about 2,000 jobs in
Alpharetta, becoming the latest high-tech company to expand in the
booming suburb north of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials confirmed Monday that ETrade will add from
1,900 to 2,200 employees and 450,000 square feet of office space to
its year-old Alpharetta campus where it currently employs 300
people. Its expansion in the Windward Business Park will take place
over the next two-and-a-half years, said Jerry Dark, a vice
president with Palo Alto, Calif.-based ETrade.
</P>
<P>
   The rapidly growing Internet stock brokerage could become one of
Alpharetta's largest employers. Nortel Networks is the city's
biggest employer with a staff of 1,700, and it too has plans to
expand.
</P>
<P>
   ETrade's first 700 additional employees are expected to move in
between January and June 2000. Atlanta-based Holder Properties
Inc., the developer for the project, has started construction on a
150,000-square-foot to 200,000-square-foot building, Dark said. The
Staubach Co. represented ETrade in its real estate negotiations.
The company now has one building in Alpharetta but envisions a
corporate campus with four or five buildings for employees with
responsibilities in customer service, marketing and financial
services. In addition to online trading, ETrade offers a variety of
personal financial services over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A publicly traded company with 1998 revenues of $245 million,
ETrade has more than doubled its number of accounts since launching
its Destination ETrade Web site seven months ago. Last week, it
signed up its one millionth customer, a software publishing
consultant from Roswell.
</P>
<P>
   Although ETrade will relocate some staff, the ``vast majority of
hiring'' will be done in metro Atlanta. The metro area's labor
force was critical in the company's decision to expand here.
Alpharetta was selected because of the availability of land,
high-tech infrastructure and quality of life, Dark said.
``Alpharetta is a great place for people to live,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ETrade is one of several major technology companies locating or
expanding in the north Atlanta suburb, said Diana Wheeler,
Alpharetta's community development director. Smaller high-tech
firms that provide services to corporate giants feed off this
growth. High-tech industry accounts for more than 20 percent of the
city's businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very excited to have them,'' Wheeler said of the
high-tech businesses that have flocked to the city in recent years.
``It's a clean industry and it has put us on the cutting edge. It's
no longer just a California phenomenon.''

 &HT;    Daredevils become more cautious with age
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Molly was little she liked to stand at the top of
the stairs and leap into my arms. Austin ``Full Contact Soccer''
Emerson was, from the start, even more extreme: The Tower of Terror
at Disney World didn't fall fast or far enough for him.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect. Two more thrill junkies to accompany me down zip lines
and off rope swings and up mountains where their mother doesn't
care to tread.
</P>
<P>
   But the world has ways of offering thrills when you don't need
them. This past Sunday, the preacher asked how many of the children
in the congregation had received bomb threats at their schools in
the previous week. Dozens of little arms went up.
</P>
<P>
   Do these kids need any more thrills?
</P>
<P>
   Now we have two new babies, and I marvel at the way my view of
risk has changed. I still play street hockey with our older
children, but when I fall down it takes longer to get back up.
Similarly, the pitfalls facing the twins seem deeper and scarier
than the ones I remember from Molly's grade school days.
</P>
<P>
   There are two explanations. Either the world is becoming a more
dangerous place, which I doubt, or I'm getting older, which is
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Children are born to leap, then look. You can't string a safety
net under every tree they climb. But one thing should come as a
relief to Maureen. If children learn to be daredevils by studying
their fathers, the twins will have a more sober role model than
their siblings did.

 &HT;    Looking for reasons behind school shooting
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The fallout from the Columbine High School massacre
continues this week as Newsweek ($3.50) and Time ($3.50) search for
clues to teen violence. A Time/CNN poll of teenagers points to
availability of guns, the Internet, uninvolved parents, video games
and violence in movies, television and music as factors that were
``somewhat responsible'' in the Colorado shootings.
</P>
<P>
   So what can parents do about kids who are absorbed in a world of
computers and video games? Time suggests that they check the
ratings of computer games, block offensive content and monitor the
Internet sites their children visit.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek, in a cover story on the secret lives of teenagers,
puts the blame on parents who don't spend enough time with them.
According to the magazine's poll, nearly half of those surveyed
believe that baby boomers are worse parents because the experiences
they had in the 1960s make them less able to provide a strong moral
base. Other results show that many of the 31 million people between
the ages of 12 and 19 say they feel alone and alienated despite
being richer, better educated and healthier than any other group in
history.
</P>
<P>
   BUGGED: Bacteria that are building resistance to antibiotics is
an old story, but one that continues to plague us. U.S. News &AMP;
World Report ($2.95) examines the race to come up with new drugs
and new plans of attack before it's too late. Even worse, the
magazine says, the use of antibacterial products in our homes may
be compounding antibiotic resistance.
</P>
<P>
   FEEDING FRENZY: Hide the Chianti and watch your liver.
Entertainment Weekly ($2.99) reports on the fight in Hollywood over
the sequel to Thomas Harris' ``The Silence of the Lambs.'' Dino De
Laurentiis, who turned Harris' ``Red Dragon'' into ``Manhunter''
for the big screen, has first negotiation rights to the movie
version of ``Hannibal.'' But MGM insists it has rights, too, since
De Laurentiis passed on making ``The Silence of the Lambs.''
Bidding for ``Hannibal'' is expected to break the $8 million mark
set by Michael Crichton's ``Airframe.'' Meanwhile, booksellers are
licking their lips over the June release of Harris' certain best
seller.
</P>
<P>
   LIKE A ROLLING STONE: Music critics have been trying to explain
(and, in most cases, understand) Bob Dylan ever since the nasal,
mumbling folk singer became a legend in the 1960s. In this week's
New Yorker ($3), writer Alex Ross suggests they were looking in all
the wrong places. It's the music, not the man, that matters, says
Ross, who followed a recent Dylan tour and attended six concerts in
six nights.

   KUDOS: The Oxford American, the bimonthly magazine published by
John Grisham and edited by Marc Smirnoff, beat The New Yorker and
other prestigious competitors to win a National Magazine Award for

picked up an award for reporting on the Monica Lewinsky affair, and
Vanity Fair won the general excellence award for magazines over 1
million circulation.

 &HT;    Pepsi ads push link to new `Star Wars'
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pepsi hopes the Force is with it.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 2 beverage company launched its ``Star Wars'' promotion
Monday when it announced it will begin distributing limited-edition
collector cans tied to the upcoming release of the ``prequel'' to
the original film series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be a very powerful promotion for Pepsi
this summer,'' said John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage
Digest. ``Star Wars has become part of the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico, which has been locked in an intense battle for U.S.
market share against Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co., is planning to
spend hundreds of million of dollars in promotions and advertising
to connect its beverages and snack foods with the new George Lucas
film, ``Star Wars, Episode 1 _ the Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   The set of 24 can designs on Pepsico soft drink brands will
initially picture one of the film's five central characters, along
with a brief biographical comment. Pepsi, for example, features
Anakin Skywalker, while Darth Maul is on Mountain Dew. Queen
Amidala will be featured on Diet Pepsi Chancellor Valdrum on Pepsi
One and Qui-Gon Jinn on Storm (in selected markets).
</P>
<P>
   The cans will start appearing on store shelves this week in
advance of the May 19 debut of the film. Then, every two to three
weeks, new characters will be introduced on the five participating
drinks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Purchase, N.Y.-based company will distribute a
total of 250,000 special Gold Yoda cans for all five brands.
Consumers can choose between keeping this collector's item or
redeeming it for a $20 ``Star Wars'' check that can be cashed for
personal use.
</P>
<P>
   In all, more than 8 billion ``Star Wars'' cans will be
distributed in the United States this summer, said Pepsi spokesman
Jon Harris.
</P>
<P>
   There also will be large in-store ``Stars Wars'' promotions,
including life-sized, three-dimensional latex characters and
cardboard cutouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about enhancing the fan experience,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   It's also about trying to grab market share, analysts said. In
1998, Coca-Cola Co. controlled 44.5 percent of the U.S. soft-drink
market, compared with 31.4 percent for Pepsico, according to
Beverage Digest.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Coca-Cola launched its biggest promotion for the
summer. About 45 million Coke Cards will be distributed in hopes of
boosting sales of the Classic brand. The cards, which target
teenagers, provide discounts and special offers at restaurants,
theme parks and other entertainment venues.

 &HT;    Best intentions can't guarantee kid safety
 &HT;    By Maureen Downey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Our 4-month-old twins have yet to stub a toe or scrape
a knee. I know the bruises, bloody noses and blisters will come.
And I won't be able to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   We can't safeguard children from all harm, no matter how
deliberate and conscientious we are. In the aftermath of Littleton,
many parents are wondering aloud whether private school or home
schooling is the answer.
</P>
<P>
   But wearing school uniforms or learning geometry at the kitchen
table can't guarantee safety. I wish it were that simple.
</P>
<P>
   I went to a small private school, but there was no magic shield
protecting my circle. Two classmates at St. Catherine's died before
graduation. One drowned on a family outing. The other fell off the
back of his dad's pickup truck in the driveway. On most days, in
most cases, the tumble would have produced a bump on the head. But
Tommy's fall was that one-in-a-million accident, and he died
instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of similar catastrophes, I hover over my brood. While Bo
encourages our older two children to climb higher on the magnolia
tree, I plead with them to come down. He tells them to ``have
fun.'' I remind them, ``Be careful.''
</P>
<P>
   I know that I should curb my anxiety. The higher they climb, the
wider the view. But I worry.

 &HT;    `Sports Night' engages smarts and heart
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There isn't a better, odder new sitcom this season than ABC's
``Sports Night.'' An hour drama built into a half-hour comedy, it's
a weekly trip to you-know-not-where, by turns funny and maddening,
obsessive and profound.
</P>
<P>
   Though set exclusively in the high-rise New York offices of a
nightly sports news show, it's not about sports; it's about
relationships and work, with sports as the easy-does-it,
talk-it-out metaphor for both of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A writer once wrote, `As if it matters how a man falls down,
when the fall is all that's left, it matters very much,' '' Jeremy
(Joshua Malina), the fanatically nerdy associate producer,
announces in the control room seconds before airtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did he mean by that? Do not abandon blowouts. Watching
proud and accomplished athletes battle in the face of odds that are
virtually hopeless is one of the more stirring sights in all of
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phillies have been down 14-1 since the third inning,'' he
concludes, ``and I think it's the best game we've got. That is
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's season-ender stays true to the quirky, no-compromises
course ``Sports Night'' established from the start. No other
network show this good is more consistent at doing what it wants to
do.
</P>
<P>
   It opens the way it almost always opens: people talking, a
deadline looming, but the people not talking about the deadline.
The two likeably pretty-boy anchors, Dan (Josh Charles) and Casey
(Peter Krause), sit at their anchor desks and, as the seconds are
counted out until they're on the air, talk about their lives' most
pressing issues. Casey, divorced, is puzzled by the strange new
formality of his 9-year-old son; single Dan is puzzled by a woman
he's dated returning to the husband from whom she was separated.
</P>
<P>
   Dan's last words before the camera blinks on, ``It's a world
gone mad.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who've followed ``Sports Night'' all season _ ratings
have been lukewarm, though ABC has re-upped it for next year _ the
real action centers on Dana (Felicity Huffman), the show's
razor-sharp, tightly wound ringmaster. Though she's had a crush on
Casey, she recently became engaged to someone outside the office.
That plays out tonight with neurotic brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   But even those who haven't watched regularly can catch enough
from the fringes to make it worth while. As long as you understand
that it's a world gone mad, you're in the loop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Night''
</P>
<P>
   9:30 tonight on ABC
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A.

 &HT;    ``Star Wars'' merchandise on sale nationwide
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Call it the Darth Mauling of America.
</P>
<P>
   George Lucas' fourth ``Star Wars'' film ``Episode 1 _ The
Phantom Menace'' with new evil character Darth Maul isn't due in
theaters until May 19, but it's already coming at fans from all
directions.
</P>
<P>
   Today, John Williams' ``Menace'' soundtrack goes on sale at
record stores across the country. On Monday, fans flocked to Toys R
Us, Target, Kmart and Wal-Mart locations nationwide to buy Anakin
Skywalker and Darth Maul action figures, electronic Qui-Gon Jinn
light sabers and other items from the new line of ``Star Wars''
merchandise, the largest and most-hyped in the history of toys.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, writer Terry Brooks' 352-page ``Phantom Menace''
novel from Ballatine Books, which relates the story of the dawn of
``Star Wars,'' was being sold on the Internet's www.amazon.com for
$15. MTV revealed a new ``Menace'' video for the soundtrack's first
single ``Duel of the Fates.'' And Pepsi USA launched its
commemorative ``Episode 1'' can collection, including special gold
Yoda cans worth $20 each in prize money.
</P>
<P>
   It's all serious business.
</P>
<P>
   The Toys R Us in Atlanta, for instance, sold $12,000 worth of
new ``Star Wars'' merchandise in 90 minutes Monday, surpassing
total sales for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In Cobb County (Ga.), William Horowitz, 17, pushed a wheelbarrow
into the Toys R Us for that store's early opening Monday so his
friends could load up on the new ``Star Wars'' toys.
</P>
<P>
   As theme music from the upcoming new film blared over the
store's intercom system, more than 100 early bird customers swarmed
the ``Phantom Menace'' section, grabbing up armloads of talking
action figures, Darth Maul 3-D Painter sets and Anakin Skywalker
Pod Racers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to get as much as I can get,'' Tally Shafizadeh, 14,
of Atlanta, said moments before he and his brother Jeffrey, 12,
began loading a shopping cart with box after box of toys to add to
their already sizable collection of 244 ``Star Wars'' action
figures at home. They planned to spend $453 _ all in cash they'd
been saving for months from allowances, yard work and odd jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest single release of toys I've ever seen,''
said Dan Sierra, district manager of K-Bee Toys in metro Atlanta.
``We're having a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   K-Bee Toys at North DeKalb Mall (Decatur, Ga.) did half of its
projected day's business by 8 a.m., Sierra said, adding that the
hottest selling items included Samuel L. Jackson's Mace Windu
action figure and Sebulo Pod Racer.
</P>
<P>
   By 9:30 a.m. Monday, some stores found their merchandise,
especially items featuring the menacing Darth Maul, significantly
depleted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty much all the action figures are gone,'' said Nancy
Gilbert, assistant manager of the Toys R Us in Cobb County. A fresh
shipment of ``Star Wars'' toys is expected on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   MTV's premiere of the 4-minute, 14-second ``Duel of the Fates''
video was enveloped in Monday afternoon's special 90-minute edition
of ``Total Request Live.''
</P>
<P>
   The video includes a few fresh snippets from the film, several
shots of Darth Maul snarling with rotten teeth and ample footage of
stars Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor (including a
shot of his hair being trimmed for the movie). Mixed in with the
film scenes are shots of John Williams conducting the London
Symphony Orchestra, director George Lucas exclaiming, ``Cut!'' and
a few behind-the-scenes moviemaking moments.
</P>
<P>
   Expect both MTV and VH1 to air the new video repeatedly for the
next couple of weeks.

LUBBOCK CHURCH REELING FROM `TRAGIC' DEATHS OF SIX GIRLS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EVAN MOORE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas _ Members of the Green Lawn Church of Christ were
reeling at the deaths of six, teen-aged girls, killed when a travel
trailer sideswiped a church bus returning from a retreat Sunday in
New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The six, ranging in age from 13 to 16, had been attending a
retreat sponsored by Green Lawn at a camp operated by Lubbock
Christian University near Artesia, N.M. They were bound for Lubbock
on U.S. 82 about 1:30 p.m. when the accident occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Police said a westbound pickup, driven by Lawrence Matthews, 75,
of Dewey, Ariz., swerved and Matthews' trailer tore along the side
of the bus.
</P>
<P>
   The six were identified as Heather Bauman, 13, daughter of
Arthur and Suzanne Bauman of Tahoka; Megan Flynn, daughter of John
and Elaine Flynn of Wolford; and Talitha Beeman, 16, daughter of
Tom and Brenda Beeman; Sara English, 15, daughter of Jady and Susan
English; Sarah Johnson, 14, daughter of Keith and Lori Johnson, and
Astyn Qubty, daughter of Johnny and Diane Qubty, all of Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   Four other girls were injured in the wreck. Three of those were
in stable condition at an Alamogordo hospital. The fourth was in
critical condition with head injuries at Albuquerque University
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   William Libby, 60, of Albuquerque, a passenger in a pickup
traveling behind the bus, also was killed in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The six girls, members of various churches in the Lubbock area,
had all been part of a group of 80 who participated in the two-day
retreat. They were among 28 persons riding in the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just tragic. They were all happy, vibrant young people,''
said Shelley Parnell, a church sponsor who had attended the
gathering with the teen-agers. ``We don't know why God chose
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Parnell said she and her sons had been in study groups with
several of the girls during the weekend, but had left Artesia
earlier in the day Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had known Sara (English) before the retreat,'' said Parnell.
``She was a great encourager, a strong presence in the youth group,
always bright, loving, giving.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had left a little note for me, saying how glad she was
that she had come on the retreat and what a good time she had
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Parnell said she had met Aston Qubty during the weekend function
and marveled at the 14-year-old's exuberance. Qubty, who attended
Lubbock Christian Junior High, played volleyball and basketball at
the school, as well as being an active member of the Green Lawn
Church of Christ youth group.
</P>
<P>
   ``She seemed to have so many friends,'' said Parnell. ``She was
always happy, never down. I wondered, 'Is she always this 'up'?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Megan Flynn, a freshman who played the flute in the Tahoka High
School Band, also was described as active in her church.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was involved in practically every church activity,'' said
Alva Conklin, minister of the Wolford Church of Christ. ``She was
just so likeable as a person and shined as a Christian so much that
she influenced a lot of other kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just an outstanding young person.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Johnson, an eighth grader at Smylie Wilson Jr. High in
Lubbock, was a National Honor Society member who participated in
volleyball, basketball and track. She had been selected ``teen of
the month'' at Smylie Wilson for May.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know this could have been worse and we are thankful that
the Lord saw fit to spare some of those on the bus,'' Dale Mannon,
minister at Green Lawn, told the Associated Press. ``We are
comforted by the fact that these girls were on a trip in which they
were celebrating and strengthening their faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were spending time with the Lord and now they are with
the Lord.''

 &HT;    Daytonites debate Dragon monicker
 &HT;    By Marc Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Thirteen-year-old Richard Burque of Huber Heights
likes dragons so much, he decided to submit the name for Dayton's
Class A baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just popped into my head,'' said Burque, a seventh grader
at Studebaker Middle School and one of 12 fans who offered the name
Dragons.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same name that local baseball authorities had already
chosen for the new team.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday at Court House Square, under a brilliant blue sky, the
Dayton Dragons became official. During a noontime ceremony that
featured a nearly two-story high inflatable dragon, Burque and most
of the hundreds of other fans on hand roared approving as the name
was announced and uniforms and logos unveiled.
</P>
<P>
   Most fans said they liked the uniqueness of the name, although
some thought it lacked any connection to the city and the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very upset. It (needed) to be something that had to do
with the Wright Brothers,'' said Larry Mathis, 62, a retired
General Motors employee who lives in Centerville. ``Anything with
flight _ that's what this city is. Even Fairmont (High School) got
rid of the Dragons.''
</P>
<P>
   Others disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it.,'' said Donald Estelle of Dayton. ``The dragon _
that's got a lot of spunk. I hope the team's got a lot of spunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of time constraints, team officials decided to choose
its name and logos prior to orchestrating a contest to ``guess''
the team's name.
</P>
<P>
   Team president Robert Murphy said about a half dozen employees
of Mandalay Sports Entertainment _ the team's ownership group _
brainstormed about possible names, including some that played on
Dayton aviation heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tossed names around,'' Murphy said. ``Some people said we
shouldn't do anything with an aviation theme. They wanted something
fresh. We listened around our office to see which names people were
talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Dragons was the one Murphy heard most often. Once the name was
chosen, graphic artist Terry Smith of California _ designer of the
NHL San Jose Sharks logo _ was picked to design the logo.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton logo features a large green dragon head with orange,
black, silver and white trim. Home uniforms display the stylized
name Dragons across the chest with Dayton spread across the chest
of road uniforms. The caps have a green D with a dragon's tail
flourish on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great logo,'' said Burque, who was chosen in a random
selection as the contest's grand winner and received two season
tickets to Dragons games as well as a merchandise pack. The 11
runners up received merchandise packs.
</P>
<P>
   The Dragons are already contemplating changes, some finetuning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thinking of altering it (the dragon head),'' Murphy
said, ``maybe with smoke coming out of the nose.''

DUE TO BUDGET CUTTING, MEDICARE SPENDING UNEXPECTEDLY FELL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New government data show that Medicare spending
actually declined in the first half of the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and President Clinton clamped down on Medicare spending
in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, curbing payments for many
services. They expected to slow the growth of Medicare. But for the
six months ending March 31, Medicare spending was in fact $2.6
billion less than the $106.5 billion spent in the similar period
the previous year, according to data from the Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   With cuts proving deeper than Congress intended, health care
providers of all types are furiously lobbying Congress to restore
money cut from their payments. They are competing with Medicare
beneficiaries who want to use the same pot of money for new
benefits, especially coverage of prescription drugs, now a major
out-of-pocket expense for the elderly and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare spending has risen continually since the program began
in 1965, and federal officials had predicted that the growth would
pick up again this year after it slowed to 1.5 percent last year.
But so far the predictions are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Hanns Kuttner, an expert on health policy who worked in the Bush
administration, said, ``This defies the first principle of Medicare
policy analysis: that Medicare costs will always rise faster than
the rate of inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John B. Breaux, D-La., who headed a bipartisan commission
on the future of Medicare, said, ``We're now starting to feel the
pinch from the Medicare cuts required in the balanced budget
agreement, and I fear the worst is yet to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, hospitals, physical therapists, home health agencies,
nursing homes and health maintenance organizations have deployed a
small army of lobbyists, seeking to persuade Congress to rewrite or
repeal parts of the 1997 law. Home health care and nursing homes
have been hit particularly hard. As a result of the cuts, they
contend, patients have less access to some types of care, like home
health services in some parts of the country, and the quality of
care has begun to erode.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare is clearly spending less than Congress anticipated. In
the spring of 1997, before passage of the Balanced Budget Act, the
Congressional Budget Office predicted that Medicare would spend
$1,348 billion on health care for the elderly and disabled from
1998 to 2002. About 39 million people are now enrolled in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   After the law was signed, in a spirit of bipartisan celebration
in August 1997, the budget office revised its estimate, predicting
that Medicare spending would total $1,249 billion in that five-year
period.
</P>
<P>
   Now the budget office is predicting that Medicare will spend
$1,146 billion in that period, a huge amount of money but much less
than anticipated just two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jordan J. Cohen, president of the Association of American
Medical Colleges, said, ``There was a gross underestimate of the
savings from the Balanced Budget Act.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital
Association, said, ``Congress really overshot the runway when it
passed the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other factors have helped stop the growth of Medicare. A
federal crackdown on fraud and abuse has made doctors, hospitals
and home health agencies more cautious in the claims they submit to
Medicare, so they are less likely to overcharge the government.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Medicare and its contractors are taking more time
to review and pay claims. The contractors are moving more slowly
because they have adopted new safeguards to detect fraud, and
because they are preoccupied with getting Medicare computers ready
for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, when Congress cut Medicare payments for one type of
service, health care providers often responded by providing more of
another service, for which the money continued to flow freely. But
this has become difficult because Congress in 1997 cut back
Medicare payments for almost all types of health care services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law had more synergy than we expected,'' said Gail R.
Wilensky, chairwoman of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission,
an independent body that advises Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare spending for home health care fell nearly 15 percent
last year, to $14.9 billion, and the Congressional Budget Office
now says home health agencies will get a total of $79 billion from
1998 to 2002, or $48 billion less than the office predicted in
January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare payments to skilled nursing homes rose 8.9 percent last
year, to $13.2 billion, but the budget office foresees a decline of
3.8 percent this year. The budget office now says nursing homes
will get $66.7 billion from 1998 to 2002, or $16.6 billion less
than the office predicted in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have drafted a letter to state officials
saying that some nursing homes face ``drastic declines in
revenues'' and ``may suddenly close their doors, potentially
placing residents at risk.'' Spokesmen for nursing home chains
agree and are pleading with Congress for more money. But an
increase for any group will be difficult.

   ``In a political sense, there's only a certain amount of money
available for Medicare,'' said John C. Rother, chief lobbyist for
AARP, formerly known as the American Association of Retired
Persons. ``To the extent it goes to providers, then it's not
available for additional benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the 1997 law was squeezing Medicare payments more
than expected, Wilensky said, ``In the short run, the answer is
definitely yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office predicts that, despite ``the
sudden flattening of Medicare expenditures'' in the last year,
annual outlays will more than double in the next decade and will
exceed $400 billion by 2008. By then there will be more than 44
million beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anticipated growth,'' it said, ``reflects advances in
medical technology that are expected to raise health care costs and
a continued increase in the use of services by beneficiaries.''

GOLDMAN SACHS TO GO PUBLIC, ENDING 130 YEARS AS PRIVATE FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By EDWARD WYATT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After years of mulling it over and at least one false
start, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said Monday that it would formally
end its 130-year status as a private partnership by selling 69
million shares, or roughly 15 percent of the firm, to the public at
$53 each, raising $3.66 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The offering, the second-largest initial stock offering by a
U.S. company, comes roughly seven months after Goldman canceled
plans to go public because of last summer's turmoil in global
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   One month after Goldman put its plans on hold, Conoco Inc., a
division of DuPont, raised $3.96 billion in the largest stock
offering by a U.S. company.
</P>
<P>
   Since last summer's squall, the stock market has rebounded and
climbed to a series of new peaks. Goldman, meanwhile, aptly
demonstrated its ability to bounce back from a market downturn with
strong first-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   So vibrant, in fact, was the demand for shares of Goldman's
offering among institutional investors that the underwriters of the
offering, led by Goldman itself, brushed aside the usual formality
of holding an over-allotment of shares in reserve to meet
exceptionally high demand.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the 9 million-share over-allotment will be sold along
with the 60 million originally planned shares, Goldman said Monday.
The $53 offering price is at the high end of the range of $45 to
$55 range Goldman had said it anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Trading in the shares, which will begin Tuesday on the New York
Stock Exchange under the symbol GS, will be closely watched on Wall
Street, where few recent initial offerings not involving Internet
companies have been well received.
</P>
<P>
   One factor that could drive demand once trading starts is that
no retail investors outside of Goldman's exclusive network of
high-net-worth customers received shares in the offering, according
to Wall Street executives. Even the best retail customers of the
dozen major Wall Street firms that joined Goldman in the
underwriting syndicate will have their first opportunity to buy
shares Tuesday. That is unusual; in most big stock offerings,
retail customers of the biggest underwriters receive at least some
allocation of shares.
</P>
<P>
   Of the shares being sold, 51 million are being offered by
Goldman Sachs, and the remaining shares are being offered by two
institutional shareholders, Sumitomo Bank Capital Markets Inc. of
Japan and Kamehameha Activities Association, the giant Hawaiian
landowner and education fund.
</P>
<P>
   The offering values Goldman Sachs at nearly $25 billion, roughly
equivalent to the market value of J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. Merrill Lynch &AMP;
Co. has a market value of $31.8 billion, while Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter &AMP; Co.'s market value is nearly $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Of Goldman's anticipated market value, about half will belong to
the company's 221 current partners, and another 20 percent will be
shared by the company's 13,000 employees. The rest of the nonpublic
shares are roughly split among Goldman's 125 retired partners and
the two outside institutional shareholders.

 &HT;    Anti-war debate stirs old echoes
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was, by the Rev. Jesse Jackson's account of it, a very
curious lesson in ethnic sensitivity: the civil rights leader,
pressing for the release of the three American soldiers held in
Yugoslavia, patiently explaining to the alleged war criminal,
Slobodan Milosevic, how it wouldn't do just to release a white
soldier and retain two Hispanic-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   As he has been in the past, Jackson was persuasive, convincing
Milosevic to release all three soldiers without conditions. His
emergence with the freed captives in tow Sunday was another of
those time warp moments in a story already overloaded with
confusing precedents.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, this administration's attitude has been chillier
toward the independent diplomacy of Jackson _ the president's
family counselor during the Monica mess _ than Ronald Reagan's in
1984 or George Bush's in 1990, when Jackson won similar concessions
from Hafez Assad, Fidel Castro and Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's latest diplomatic feat does, in fact, come at a more
delicate juncture.
</P>
<P>
   There has been an understandable tendency to try to grasp this
conflict in terms of either Vietnam, with the grim prospect of an
intractable, increasingly unpopular morass, or the Gulf War, with
the happier promise of a prompt, high-tech solution. This has
resulted in such paradoxical moments as Sunday when Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott followed Jackson in evoking John Lennon's Vietnam
era appeal and called on the administration to ``give peace a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand how the political response to the war is taking
shape in this country, however, it might be more useful to look
farther back to the way the debate was framed in the years before
the nation's entrance into World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In such vocal critics of the Balkans war as former Vice
President Dan Quayle, Rep. John Kasich and commentator Pat
Buchanan, it's much easier to trace an hereditary link with the old
isolationist wing of the Republican Party in the 1930s than the
liberal McCarthyites and student radicals of the 1960s anti-war
movement.
</P>
<P>
   The politics of that day seemed to evaporate with the 1940
nomination of the Republican internationalist Wendell Willkie and
the shock of Pearl Harbor, which made the political argument moot
for a time.
</P>
<P>
   But the Main Street, middle-American sentiments formerly
expressed by followers of the late Sen. Robert Taft have proven to
be resilient enough to matter in the century's closing year. Old
lines run deep: The two Democrats who joined with 15 Republicans
last week to force a legal showdown over the War Powers Act were
from Taft's home state of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   One could hear an echo of those days in last week's House
debate, when Democratic Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland compared
Kasich to British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain for suggesting
negotiations with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The revival of Taftism is not the administration's only concern,
however. Unless the letter Jackson brought with him from Milosevic
holds the key to an unexpected resolution of the current Balkan
conflict, Jackson's foray to Belgrade and the administration's
decision to brush aside his appeal for a bombing halt could signal
the beginning of a more vocal critique of the war from the left,
which so far has been much conflicted about how to react to this
conflict. And that would leave the Clinton administration defending
itself on both political flanks.

`SPORTS NIGHT' FANS WILL CHEER JAFFEE'S RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last fall, I figured that working for Isaac Jaffee at
Continental Sports Channel would be better than a lifetime supply
of cashews. Shoot, I'd have worked for peanuts, but Jaffee went and
had a stroke and left me wondering if I should even bother applying
for a job there.
</P>
<P>
   Before he took ill, Jaffee was a big bottle of Elmer's on the
workbench of life. When the joinery of a late-night sports show was
buckling under the pressure of breaking news, technical hiccups and
personal conflicts, Jaffee kept it all together with a well-placed
dab of good counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But during Jaffee's absence these past few months, CSC and its
signature show, ``Sports Night,'' have come unglued. The anchors
have behaved erratically, occasionally doing the show without
pants. Worse, their producer is her own lifetime supply of nuts,
and nobody seems able to get through to her on conventional
channels. Even the smart-as-a-whip assistants, who usually keep
things running when the big dogs are foaming at the mouth, have
shown signs of distemper.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, CSC doesn't really exist and ``Sports Night'' is
only a fictional TV show about a fictional TV show. But when
Jaffee's alter ego, Robert Guillaume, actually went down with a
stroke in January, the best new show of the 1998-99 television
season got sick, too.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Guillaume returns briefly for a season finale
that's far more predictable than ``Sports Night'' tends to be. But
it's great to have him back for a few seconds, and even more
comforting to know he intends to return in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   As I mentioned months ago, when this season was barely into its
first ratings sweep, Jaffee is the kind of boss we'd all like to
have or like to be: tough but fair, demanding but supportive,
unafraid to make a decision. His only failing seems to be that he
didn't groom a successor in the event of his prolonged absence.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it happens. You never plan to be sick. And, in a way, the
reaction of the ``Sports Night'' crew to the Guillaume/Jaffee
stroke was fairly typical: mild panic, and then an uneasy
arrangement as everyone hunkered down and hoped for the best. But
as the cast carried on gamely without Guillaume's brilliantly
subtle portrayal of Jaffee, it was obvious that the ``Sports
Night'' dynamic was changing. Scripts that were crackling became
brittle. Characters that were unusual became annoying.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was the inevitable case of creative vapor lock paying
a visit to Aaron Sorkin's brainchild. Different as ``Sports Night''
is, it is not immune to the pernicious conventions of network TV.
Well-known for his independent streak, playwright Sorkin still gave
in on some fronts (or at least succumbed to a man's stereotypical
images). For example, the leading women of ``Sports Night'' still
wear the skin-tight uniform of the sexy sitcom babe. And when it
comes to neurotic behavior, Felicity Huffman's Dana Whitaker is the
character most likely to win a weekend in a padded hotel suite.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that ``Sports Night'' isn't a sitcom. Its half-hour
format hews to the sitcom model, and so ABC dresses it as a sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday night's season-ending episode makes it clear that
Guillaume is the key if ``Sports Night'' is going to have the
success it deserves as an example of The New Wave of TV. Sure, Dana
is smart and feisty, Dan Rydell (Josh Charles) is smart and witty,
and Casey McCall (Peter Krause) is smart and obsessively
compulsive. ``Sports Night'' also gives us the smart and combless
Natalie Hurley (Sabrina Lloyd) and the smart and relentless Jeremy
Goodwin (Joshua Malina).
</P>
<P>
   Together, these off-kilter characters create a bizarre sort of
Greek chorus while simultaneously playing the principal characters
in a weekly minidrama. Their clever, rapid-fire byplay often
becomes the main dialogue, making it quite apparent that in each
person's life the big story isn't necessarily the one at the top of
the newscast.
</P>
<P>
   During Guillaume's absence, though, the chorus escaped from the
corral. Character development took a back seat to cleverness, and
``Sports Night'' ceased being a must-watch item. It was as if
Sorkin and his writers were playing Scrabble, trying to come up
with impressive words while waiting for Guillaume to recover and
bring the show back to its center.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Guillaume's time on the screen is barely worth a
mention in the credits, but his presence does give an otherwise
silly episode its essential compass. Let's hope he never leaves
``Sports Night'' again.

   LITTLETON, Colo. _ As Columbine High School students returned to
class Monday for the first time since the massacre there almost two
weeks ago, a 22-year-old graduate of the school was charged with
providing a powerful, semi-automatic handgun to one of the killers.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office said he
did not know whether the man, Mark Edward Manes, sold, gave or lent
the gun or which gunman, Eric Harris or Dylan Klebold, was the
recipient.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who worked with Harris and Klebold at a local pizza
parlor put Manes in touch with them, said Steve Davis, the
sheriff's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents tracked the pistol, a Tec-DC9, from its
manufacturer, Navegar Inc., in Miami to a wholesaler in Illinois
and then to a gun shop in a suburb 5 miles north of Denver. After
the shop closed last June, Larry Russell, a business partner of the
owner, sold the gun at a Denver area gun show.
</P>
<P>
   Manes was booked on a charge of providing a gun to a minor, a
felony, and was released on $15,000 bond. A conviction could carry
penalties as severe as six years in jail and a $500,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Klebold's girlfriend, Robyn Anderson, has admitted buying two
shotguns and a rifle for him. But she was not charged because it is
legal in Colorado for a minor to own shotguns and rifles.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting bond this afternoon, Manes did not immediately
return to the modest pea-green ranch-style house in the Columbine
Hills subdivision where he grew up, half a mile east of the Harris
residence.
</P>
<P>
   The Jefferson County Coroner's Office reported Monday that
Harris had the antidepressant Luvox in his system when he and
Klebold went on a shooting and bombing rampage at the school,
killing 12 students and a teacher before killing themselves. The
Department of Defense has said that the Marines rejected Harris'
application for enlistment when it learned he was taking the drug,
which is commonly prescribed for obsessive compulsive disorder, but
can also be used to treat depression.
</P>
<P>
   When the Columbine students returned to class Monday, at their
former rival, Chatfield High School, ``eight to 10 friends or
associates'' of the gunmen, who could ``all be classified as
witnesses,'' were asked not come, Davis said. He said that school
officials had asked for a list of the students and called their
parents, asking them to home school them for the remainder of the
school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a lot of reasons, but primarily for their
well-being, as well as because it's a very uncomfortable, difficult
time for everyone involved,'' said Rick Kaufman, a spokesman for
Jefferson County Public Schools. ``Our goal is to get back to some
normal schedule, there's still about four weeks of school left so
there is still plenty of learning yet to be done.
</P>
<P>
   Chatfield High School welcomed the Columbine students with
banners and signs with messages including ``We Are One.'' The sign
showed the Columbine school colors, blue and white, and the
Chatfield colors, maroon and white, intertwined into a heart shape.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the school year, Chatfield students will attend
school in the morning and Columbine students will have classes in
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the students arriving during the lunch hour Monday
looked as if they had a new uniform _ blue jeans and white T-shirts
that read ``We Are...'' on the front and ``Columbine'' on the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little nervous,'' said Sara Filipiak,'' a 15-year-old
freshman who was also wearing a little blue and white ribbon on her
shirt. ``But I want to be with my classmate and teachers.'' The
cheerleader from Columbine said she was in the cafeteria when the
shooting began on April 20.
</P>
<P>
   Mental health counselors were in every classroom, encouraging
students to describe what they saw. For students overcome with
emotion, the school had set aside ``safe rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students said they did not want to talk to counselors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel more comfortable talking to my friends and stuff,''
said Sara, who said she also talked to her family about her
experience.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to preserve privacy, sheriff's deputies kept
reporters away from Chatfield, largely standing on the far side of
a busy avenue. With television networks competing intensely over
the story, Jon DeStefano, president of the Jefferson County Public
Schools, announced Friday that at least one news organization had
supplied video cameras to students, offering to pay them to
surreptitiously film inside the school.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, repercussions were still heard here over the
sheriff's office admission that a neighbor's complaint that Harris
was setting off pipe bombs and posting death threats on the
Internet never made it to the desk of a juvenile magistrate. On
March 25, 1998, one week after the complaint was filed, the
magistrate granted a form of juvenile probation to Harris, who was
charged along with Klebold with breaking into a van. On Friday, the
magistrate, John DeVita, said he would not have granted probation
to Harris in the van break-in if he had been told of the threats.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the sheriff's spokesman, said that record keeping at the
sheriff's office is not computerized and that records are not
automatically sent to juvenile magistrates or diversion officers.

COMMENTARY: KOSOVO AND COLUMBINE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The failure of the House of Representatives to muster
even a one-seat majority in favor of the administration's air war
in Yugoslavia has given birth to a new dictum: Foreign policy stops
at the water's edge.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that politics stopped at the water's edge, and
that was where foreign policy started. But when the vast majority
of House Republicans are unwilling to give even symbolic backing
for the administration's air campaign against Slobodan Milosevic,
while U.S. pilots are in the middle of that war with 18 NATO
allies, then you know we're in a new world.
</P>
<P>
   It's now official: Bill Clinton has made the Republican Party
crazy. And he has done that by taking all the Republicans' good
stuff and leaving them with abortion. How crazy are the House
Republicans today? Crazy enough to vote against the air war in
Yugoslavia, but in favor of massively increasing the defense
budget; crazy enough to vote in favor of expanding NATO, while
dissing NATO's biggest post-cold-war operation. Say what?
</P>
<P>
   But as dysfunctional as the House Republicans are these days,
that is not the whole explanation for last week's 213-to-213 tie
vote. In fairness, the House vote was about more than just hating
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   I've just spent a few weeks on the road in America, from the
East Coast to the Midwest to California, talking with people
interested in current events, and the ambivalence that was
reflected in the House vote is a true mirror of the ambivalence in
the country about Kosovo. The early enthusiasm has waned _ not
because of Kosovo or Clinton, but because of Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever enthusiasm existed for a ground war in Kosovo, or even
the sort of intense air campaign that I have favored, has been
diluted by the murders at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
And people in Washington are missing something important if they
don't understand that.
</P>
<P>
   The events in Littleton knocked the stuffing out of this
country. It's not that people are using it as an excuse for
ignoring the hard choices in Kosovo. It is more profound. They are
sincerely troubled by Columbine, and what it might say about their
own schools, their own communities and their own kids, and it has
broken the intense focus on Kosovo. People see the horrific
pictures of refugees streaming out of Kosovo, they read about the
atrocities, but, for many, their hearts and minds are engaged
elsewhere. Littleton has gone to a very deep place.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to understand why. The shootings in Littleton were
not by deprived youths, and they were not carried out by an
obviously depraved single gunman, who could be written off as a
psycho. Rather, they happened in a ``Leave It to Beaver''
neighborhood _ and the gunmen were Wally and Eddie Haskell. Until
we hear from the parents in this story, until we unearth the
psychological smoking gun that explains how a young man of
privilege could go to the prom on the weekend and then shoot up his
schoolmates the next week, it is going to gnaw at the country.
</P>
<P>
   It has left people who live half a country away from Littleton
feeling less safe. A man came up to me in Baltimore the other day
and said that when he was growing up, no one in his neighborhood
locked the doors, and kids, even those looking for trouble, had to
go a long way to find it. The murders in Littleton, though, and
particularly the fact that one of the presumed gunmen had his own
blood-chilling Web site, had got him thinking afresh about his own
kids, he said. He suddenly realized that, with the Internet, it
didn't matter anymore what neighborhood he lived in, or whether he
locked the doors or not _ because trouble was now a fingertip away.
With ``one mouse click,'' his kids could be in a porn shop, a
pedophile's living room, a casino, a gun shop, a neo-Nazi hall, and
Lord only knows where else.
</P>
<P>
   And there is something else out there, an unstated question,
also gnawing at people: If our own kids can shoot other kids at
school, how can we ever hope to cure Kosovo? We are chasing evil in
the Balkans, hoping to catch it, and then we find it's right around
the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Columbine cannot be, and should not be, an argument for walking
away from Kosovo. In fact, I found that if I scratched people, most
still favored some sort of American activism in Kosovo. But you do
have to scratch people more now, because they are, emotionally,
otherwise engaged. Their hearts and minds are focused on a
different front _ the one in their own backyards.

 NEW YORK: declining markets. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But on Monday twice as many stocks advanced as fell on the New
York Stock Exchange, indicating strength throughout the market.
That the shift away from the Nifty Fifty and into value stocks has
been accomplished as the broader indexes are rising is just another
case of history being made by this prolonged bull market.
</P>
<P>
   Acuff argued that value stocks were so depressed, prior to the
April move, that their rebound looked like a turnaround typically
seen after stocks have fallen. ``The trigger was people felt the
U.S. economy continued to be strong, the rest of the world was
improving and it was almost the equivalent of coming out of a
recession or the bottom of a bear market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's euphoria coincided with the pricing of Goldman, Sachs &AMP;
Co.'s initial public stock offering of 69 million shares. The
offering, priced at $53 a share, raised $3.66 billion for the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Investment managers said that money pouring into stocks that had
previously been depressed had an explosive effect on their prices.
Because many of these companies had been rejected by investors for
years, their market values were low and their trading had become
desultory. With investors charging into these stocks, their shares
reacted like beach balls held underwater and suddenly released.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors who had been pursuing the stocks and strategies
that had produced the biggest gains in recent years may be
unconvinced that value companies can stay on top. Old habits _ such
as buying large growth companies in the belief that their earnings
and share prices only go up _ die hard. And they are especially
tough to abandon after they have provided such astounding profits
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   No question, if the S&AMP;P 500 continues to underperform the Dow by
a large margin, there will be legions of unhappy investors. That's
because in recent weeks, most of the money going into stock mutual
funds has flooded the gates of index funds that mirror the
performance of the S&AMP;P, which is a laggard. And most of the
top-performing mutual funds in the first quarter of this year were
those that held the former leadership stocks. Investors who placed
money with these managers as a result of their recent gains are
likely be disappointed now.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts warn that while the broadening of the market is
positive, until the hoped-for earnings gains among the cyclical
stocks appear, it remains expensive historically. Richard Brody,
head of U.S. equity management at PPM America in Chicago, said:
``If you have a continued rotation out of the bigger names, you
could have the S&AMP;P suffering some significant declines. Maybe the
value stocks continue to outperform because they don't correct as
much as some of the larger-cap stocks. Going up 10 percent a month
is not a sustainable rate. It would be nice, but it's not
sustainable.''

DOLE STICKS TO STANCE ON GUNS IN CHALLENGE TO THE NRA
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By   RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Taking on the National Rifle Association,
long a sacred cow among many Republicans, Elizabeth Dole asserted
Monday, ``I don't think that any special interest group should
dictate what our position is going to be on particular issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole's remarks, responding to questions from reporters,
amplified her speech at a Republican Party gathering here on
Sunday, when she called for measures like retaining the prohibition
on assault weapons, backing a ban on armor-piercing bullets and
favoring child safety locks on guns. The speech drew a tepid
response from the Republican audience.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Mrs. Dole said her comments on guns in the wake of
the killings of 15 people at a high school in Littleton, Colo.,
were part of her strategy to win the presidential nomination by
trying to ``push the Republican Party in a more inclusive
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole, he added, would continue to reach out to moderate
voters and ``speak with a different tone of voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole, who made herself available to a small cluster of
reporters following her on the campaign trail Monday afternoon,
insisted that she was not worried that her position on guns would
damage her prospects among conservatives in the Republican
primaries. In most polls in New Hampshire, which traditionally
holds the first primary, and nationwide, Mrs. Dole places second to
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to share my views, then we'll see who agrees and who
disagrees,'' she said. ``Obviously you want to take into account
everyone's interests. But, certainly, I don't think the party
should be dominated by special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the NRA was too influential, Mrs. Dole replied: ``Well,
let's leave it where it is. I certainly believe in the Second
Amendment and a person's right to bear arms. But, like I said last
night, you don't need an AK-47 to defend your family. If that's
something that an organization disagrees with, then so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Manown, a spokesman for the rifle association, said that the
group just concluded its annual conference and that no official was
available to respond to Mrs. Dole's comments.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole also spoke out for the first time about Bush. Asked
about his impressive early showing, she said; ``He's certainly got
a famous name _ that's one thing. But he'll have to make the
appearances and speak to the issues. Then we'll see if it holds
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republican contenders have groused about Bush's decision
not to appear at a dinner here on Sunday, or at any other events,
until after the Texas Legislature adjourns on May 31.
</P>
<P>
   When asked Monday about the governor's decision, Mrs. Dole said:
``He had to make a judgment whether he's going to come and be with
the rest of us last night or not. And his judgment was he wanted to
stay in Texas. And that's his privilege and his right.''
</P>
<P>
   Will his absence hurt Bush?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see what happens,'' Mrs. Dole said as she slipped into
her waiting car.

BOOKSELLERS BATTLE CHAINS, WEB MERCHANTS AT ANNUAL EXPO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There was no new John Grisham, no new Anne Rice,
no new Tom Wolfe either. But there was, thank goodness, a new
Michael Crichton, a new Scott Turow, a new William Least Heat-Moon,
plus Frank McCourt's eagerly anticipated sequel to ``Angela's
Ashes'' and Thomas Harris' long-awaited sequel to ``The Silence of
the Lambs.''
</P>
<P>
   So as the country's independent booksellers and publishers
gathered last weekend for their annual prom _ now called BookExpo
America _ there was reason for hope about upcoming books and the
selling seasons ahead. Hope, but hardly ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   But then, this is a national convention where the main commodity
these days is irony. Major publishers mounted massive displays that
filled two halls of the mammoth Los Angeles Convention Center, but
found themselves hawking wares to an ever-diminishing sector of the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Independent booksellers have been assaulted first by chain
superstores, then Internet purveyors led by Seattle's Amazon.com,
so the ``indies'' have seen their portion of the book market cut in
half (to 16.6 percent) during this decade and membership in their
trade organization drop from 5,200 to 3,500.
</P>
<P>
   The convention's first day also included the distressing
announcement of a national study that found that, despite a booming
economy, sales of books sold to adults dropped 3 percent last year.
Chain stores claimed 25 percent of sales, while Internet purveyors
(measured for the first time) claimed 2 percent, as indie share
continued its decline.
</P>
<P>
   Things have gotten so grim for independents that they come to
the annual confab of the American Booksellers Association wondering
about the latest book stores killed in action and, as bookseller
John Barrigner of Charlotte, N.C., put it, ``which of our good
friends we won't see this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Worries about their fate have reached such a state that
booksellers in their official annual meeting portion of the
convention found themselves debating whether to censure McCourt,
winner of the Pulitzer Prize and one of the country's best-selling
authors. The phenomenal success of ``Angela's Ashes'' had paid many
bookseller bills since publication, and it had been given an annual
prize (the ABBY award) as the book that independents most enjoyed
selling.
</P>
<P>
   But McCourt had gone on to commit what some independents
considered a traitorous act. He had appeared in a TV commercial
extolling the virtues of the Web site of Barnes &AMP; Noble. So a
handful of upstart independents urged a censure of McCourt and a
request that he return his ABBY. The motion failed handily Saturday
afternoon, but only after a spirited and sometimes heated debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not political, I don't know the details of the bookseller
war,'' McCourt said the next morning. ``If I had known, I might
have thought twice about appearing in that ad. I am in favor of
independents, but the big boys sell books, too. A writer's real job
is to write books. But if you look at the stores where I appeared
on behalf of `Angela's Ashes,' it was probably 15 to 1 in favor of
independents. My conscience is clear.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCourt imbroglio was one of the few contentious moments at
a convention repeatedly described as ``businesslike.'' It may have
been held in the city that defines glitz, but the three-day
proceedings had a workmanlike air, perhaps in part because the
weather outside the hall was chilly and gray and offered little
temptation.
</P>
<P>
   Even a cocktail party at the Playboy Mansion to celebrate
Grove/Atlantic's upcoming publication of ``The Century of Sex'' _
undoubtedly the weekend's hottest ticket _ seemed deflated by the
weather. At poolside, chairman Hugh Hefner looked distinctly chilly
in his trademark smoking jacket and silk pajama pants, and the two
statuesque Playboy Bunnies in their skimpy costumes seemed in real
danger of contracting chest colds.
</P>
<P>
   The convention's estimated 29,000 visitors were encouraged by
some marketplace moves by the ABA, highlighted by the unveiling of
the new Web site BookSense.com, which will allow individual
independent stores to have their own customized presence on the
Internet. It will draw upon the strength of bookseller numbers and
process orders from customers.
</P>
<P>
   This may not terrify Amazon.com, but it did excite independents.
Throughout the weekend, they crowded around demos of the Web site,
expected to be running within six months, and a poster was often
updated with the number of BookSense enrollees, up to a robust 865
booksellers by Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Avin Domnitz, ABA executive director, was ecstatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started introducing BookSense at regional meetings, we
hoped to come to this convention with 300 stores enrolled so that
it would be a legitimate program,'' Domnitz said. ``And we thought
that if we left the convention with 500 stores, we would have
reached critical mass.''
</P>
<P>
   On the book front, this fall's offerings seemed solid, although
no one book seemed to spark the kind of buzz that some books have
enjoyed at past conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Strong non-fiction titles include memoirs by astronaut John
Glenn (Bantam), Sen. John McCain (Random House) and McCourt
(Scribner); and biographies of Hillary Clinton by Gail Sheehy
(Random House), Jack Dempsey by Roger Kahn (Harcourt Brace) and
Nelson Mandela by Anthony Sampson (Knopf).
</P>
<P>
   There is also William Least Heat-Moon's river journey across
America (Houghton Mifflin); Richard Rhodes' timely examination of
why people commit violent crimes (Knopf); John Nathan's inside look
at the rise and fall of Sony (Houghton Mifflin); Seattle author
Erik Larson's recreation of a 1900 Texas hurricane, ``Isaac's
Storm'' (Ballantine); Susan Faludi's look at the plight of the
American male, ``Stiffed'' (Morrow); and Michael ``Liar's Poker''
Lewis' Silicon Valley saga, ``The New New Thing'' (Norton).
</P>
<P>
   Strong fiction titles include Turow's ``Personal Injuries''
(Farrar Straus), Crichton's ``Timeline'' (Knopf), Claire Messud's
``The Last Life'' (Harcourt Brace), Brian Herbert and Kevin J.
Anderson's prequel to ``Dune'' titled ``Dune: House Atreides''
(Bantam), and Harris' ``Lambs'' sequel, ``Hannibal'' (Dell).
</P>
<P>
   The most eagerly awaited fall children's book, hands down, is
the second Harry Potter book by British author J.K. Rowling,
``Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' (Scholastic). The
already published British edition has prompted an Internet shopping
frenzy across borders.

NATO SHIFTS TACTICS ON BOMBING ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-NATO) 
(sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT and STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO warplanes have begun flying more low-altitude
bombing raids against Yugoslav forces in Kosovo, a practice that
until now had been ruled out as too dangerous, Pentagon officials
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the lower-altitude raids, NATO is seizing upon
improved weather and its growing aerial armada to launch 500 to 600
missions a day against a broader array of targets. The increased
tempo and the stepped up low-level bombing is paying dividends,
NATO and Pentagon officials insist.
</P>
<P>
   But this is also being accompanied by a stepped-up Yugoslav
defense. The net result of these factors has been a greatly
increased risk to allied pilots. Three NATO fighter-bombers were
hit by ground fire over the weekend, and one of them crashed.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the six weeks of air and missile strikes, fear of
casualties has limited the exposure of pilots to Yugoslavia's
anti-aircraft batteries and surface-to-air missiles. As a result,
most of NATO's 3,300 strike missions have been conducted from high
altitudes, typically more than 15,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Pentagon and NATO refuse to discuss the
altitudes at which pilots are now operating, but the Pentagon
recently showed a video image of an F-16 fighter bomber strafing
oil storage tanks near Kosovo's provincial capital, Pristina, from
what appeared to be far less than 15,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   And A-10 Warthogs, which are the Air Force's premier aircraft
for destroying tanks but which have been limited to spotting
missions at higher altitudes, have for the first time launched
significant numbers of attacks at low altitudes, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In another shift from previous tactics, NATO warplanes have been
hitting targets they encounter while flying over Yugoslavia as well
as preselected ones. In some cases, officials said, low-level
attack jets loiter in the skies outside of Yugoslavia and, when
directed by reconnaissance aircraft, dart in over Kosovo to blast
tanks, artillery batteries and command posts, which brings the
planes much closer to enemy guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're flying more sorties,'' a senior defense official said.
``We're flying more hours in the day. We're flying against more
targets. And we're focusing on more targets that are moving in
Kosovo and that require flying at different altitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   As NATO has escalated its air campaign, Yugoslavia has
intensified its counterattacks. The same clear skies that have
aided NATO pilots have allowed Yugoslav gunners on the ground to
fire more effectively and intensely on the ever-increasing number
of aircraft overhead. A full moon in recent days has made it even
easier to spot allied warplanes at night.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said on Monday that an F-117 stealth fighter was hit
early Saturday by shrapnel from a Soviet-era SA-3 surface-to-air
missile, but was able to return to base in Germany. The officials
said another American aircraft, an A-10, made an emergency landing
in Macedonia after one of its two engines was knocked out by heavy
ground fire. Neither pilot was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the officials said that an American F-16 that crashed
with engine failure over Serbia on Saturday had in all likelihood
been hit by Yugoslav ground fire or exploding fragments from a
ground-to-air missile. The pilot was rescued and whisked to an
allied air base within three hours of plummeting to the earth near
the Bosnian border. Officials had said on Sunday that they did not
believe the plane had been hit.
</P>
<P>
   In the 41 days of attacks so far, NATO has lost only two planes
to combat fire, the F-16 and an F-117 stealth fighter shot down on
the fourth day of the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, a Harrier jump jet flown by the Marine Corps crashed
into the Adriatic while on a training mission, and a Apache
helicopter crashed in Albania last week. But so far the United
States and NATO have suffered no significant casualties and no
deaths.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A senior Defense official said there appeared to be no
connection between the hits on the three aircraft, which evidently
were flying at different altitudes when struck, none especially
low. ``It's still a very capable air defense system,'' the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, senior Pentagon officials said on Monday that the forces
of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, had increased both
anti-aircraft fire and surface-to-air missile attacks, especially
in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Possibly Milosevic feels like he has to be a little more
defensive,'' Maj. Gen. Charles F. Wald, a senior officer on the
Pentagon's Joint Staff, said on Monday. ``The intensity of the air
campaign has increased significantly over the last few days.''
</P>
<P>
   As the allied bombing has weakened the ability of Yugoslavia's
air defenses to operate effectively as a network, Wald said,
gunners on the ground seem to have been given more latitude to
shoot at will.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may have less of a central control over their weapons,
possibly, and therefore, there may be a little more autonomy for
people to fire'' the surface-to-air missiles, Wald said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, Yugoslavia's missile operators are now
occasionally turning on their targeting radars to home in on NATO
warplanes, despite the risk that carries of drawing fire from
allied anti-radar missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But in another sign the Pentagon is worrying about the risk to
pilots, Secretary of Defense William Cohen has activated 120 Air
Force reservists called up from the 939th Rescue Wing in Portland,
Ore., whose job is primarily to swoop in behind enemy lines to free
downed allied aviators.
</P>
<P>
   With the Pentagon seeing results, American military intelligence
now estimates that Yugoslavia's troops in Kosovo will run out of
fuel in six weeks without new methods of supply.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, NATO carried out some of its most successful
bombing of the air campaign. Wald said that about 50 percent of the
77 targets hit were Yugoslav army or special police forces. Allied
warplanes also hit communication lines, command bunkers, radio
relay stations and surface-to-air missile sites.

ADAMS FOSTERS RESPECT AS UCLA COACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gary Adams has been a Bruin for life. He graduated from UCLA in
1962 _ that's two years before the basketball team won its first
NCAA championship _ and he's in his 25th season as its baseball
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Although Adams won his 1,000th game earlier this season, he's at
an age (59) when coaches are nudged out if the program isn't
competing for a national championship year after year.
</P>
<P>
   With seven games to play, the Bruins are breaking even this year
(26-26) and have only been consistently dominant in the 1990s.
Still, Adams is one of the nation's most respected coaches,
well-liked by his peers and admired by his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Gary Adams is one of the great guys and class acts in
college baseball,'' said USC coach Mike Gillespie, who first
competed against Adams as a Trojans player in the early 1960s. ``He
has got a thousand friends, a friend for every win. He is a real
credit to college baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no significant call for him to step down _ which might
be the case at another school with another coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hear the whispers,'' Adams said. ``If the
administration says, `You must win,' I can find ways to win. That
hasn't been expressed to me in any kind of a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams, who said he isn't disappointed by this season because of
his team's youth, isn't retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in good condition,'' he said. ``(I'll stay) as long as
UCLA wants me, as long as the players want me and as long as I'm
happy doing what I'm doing, which I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams hasn't lost touch with players and his reputation for
developing players is respected by major-league scouts. A few
scouts who watched the Bruins upset nationally ranked USC 8-5 on
Sunday said Adams' players are polished and ready for professional
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 32 players Adams has sent to the major leagues are
Eric Karros, Troy Glaus, Tim Leary, Todd Zeile, Jeff Conine and Don
Slaught.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason UCLA has 17 players on the roster who were
drafted out of high school but who chose to attend UCLA. Freshman
pitcher Josh Karp turned down a reported $2 million signing bonus
from the Braves last year to go to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got a good feeling from (Adams),'' said sophomore
outfielder Bill Scott, who was drafted in the 24th round by the
Braves in '97 out of Alemany High. ``You're able to talk to him. He
tries to make it the best situation for you to get drafted. From
high school to now, I've learned a lot and I'm a better
ballplayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams says he is available to the players, but he's not seeking
to become their friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm their `dad' away from home, but I'm not one of them,'' he
said. ``I tell them, `Don't invite me to your parties.' (But) I try
to keep an open door. I try to stay communicative. I know the
juniors and seniors on this team have no problems approaching me.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA is 50-59 since advancing to the College World Series in
'97. With a roster full of standout freshmen and sophomores, the
Bruins could be ranked among the nation's top 10 teams next season.
</P>
<P>
   Adams will be ready to make a run at the national title that has
eluded him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't do anything but coach college baseball,'' Adams said.
``This is all I've ever done. I'm not qualified to do anything
else.''

If UCLA can sweep Oregon State this weekend, and win at least two
of three against Stanford at home on May 14-16, it will merit
serious consideration for an at-large bid to the NCAA playoffs,
which begin on May 28 with a field of 64 for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at how the NCAA selection committee will look at
the Bruins and the rest of the Los Angeles-area Division I teams:
</P>
<P>
   __ Locked in: USC, Pepperdine, Cal State Fullerton. The Trojans
can either get in automatically by winning the Pac-10 (USC is two
games behind first-place Stanford) or receiving an at-large bid,
despite losing two of three against UCLA this past weekend. Expect
the latter.
</P>
<P>
   USC (30-22, 15-7) slugged its way to the national title last
year, but don't forget the Trojans had a first-round pick in staff
ace Seth Etherton. Junior left-hander Barry Zito has accepted the
No. 1 starter's role and flourished with a 10-2 record and
nine-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   If Zito beats Washington on May 14, he can become the third
Pac-10 pitcher since 1989 to win all his conference starts.
Etherton was 10-0 in '97 and Scott Erickson was 10-0 for Arizona in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine (37-10, 16-8), which is leading the West Coast
Conference's Coast Division, can host the WCC championship series
if Loyola Marymount continues its slump.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves, who have cooled a bit since winning 31 of their first
35 games, are battling USC for the chance to host one of the
playoffs' 16 sub-regionals.Cal State Fullerton (40-9, 21-3 in the
Big West) has been ranked as high as No. 2 in some polls and is
making a run at its fourth national championship.
</P>
<P>
   __ Fighting for consideration: UCLA, Loyola Marymount, Long
Beach State. With nonconference wins over Georgia Tech (two), Rice
and Arkansas (two), UCLA proved it could be competitive in a
regional situation.
</P>
<P>
   What hurts the Bruins' cause is an 0-4 record against Cal State
Northridge, UC Santa Barbara and McNeese State, and a 12-19 record
away from home.
</P>
<P>
   Also, UCLA's scheduled nonconference game with nationally ranked
Cal State Fullerton on Wednesday was canceled when the Titans found
out the NCAA counted their exhibition game against the Angels on
Easter as one of the 56 games a team is allowed to play during a
season.
</P>
<P>
   LMU (26-23, 14-10) rose to No. 29 in Collegiate Baseball's poll,
sweeping Pepperdine three weeks ago. But the Lions have lost seven
of nine since then and are now in a tie with Portland for the West
Division lead.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its recent slump, this was a Lions program that hadn't
had a winning season since 1991 before taking the WCC title last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach State (27-19, 15-8) was under .500 midway through the
season but, as has been the 49ers' pattern under head coach Dave
Snow, finished strong. An at-large bid isn't a slam dunk, but the
49ers' past success in the postseason will probably carry them
through.
</P>
<P>
   __ Maybe next year: CSUN.The Matadors won't have an argument
against being shut out of a bid this season; they are 25-28 after
losing two of three at New Mexico over the weekend. With a solid
recruiting class and good young talent, head coach Mike Batesole's
Matadors could win 40 games next year.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton held an extended discussion
Monday with the Russian special envoy for the Balkans, but the
White House remained pessimistic about the prospect of a deal
anytime soon to end the conflict in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials expressed gratitude for Russian efforts to
broker a peace, but said the bombardment of Yugoslavia would
continue unabated until President Slobodan Milosevic bends to
allied demands.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian envoy, for 90
minutes at the White House late Monday afternoon, and then briefly
with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who secured the freedom last weekend
of three American servicemen held in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin said after his meeting with the president that he
had brought a plan from Moscow and Belgrade for ending the Balkan
conflict, but did not provide details. He said that he and Clinton
had discussed the terms under which NATO would halt its air attacks
on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got closer to a diplomatic solution,'' Chernomyrdin said.
However, he added, ``This process requires a very detailed
negotiation, discussion. There can be no uncertainty because the
stakes are very high.''
</P>
<P>
   But American officials said that Milosevic appeared no closer to
accepting allied terms for ending the fighting despite six hours of
talks with Chernomyrdin last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect these discussions will continue for days and weeks,''
Sandy Berger, the White House national security adviser, said at a
briefing this evening. ``It won't result in some magical
breakthrough in the next nanosecond.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the Russians were useful as an intermediary between
NATO and Belgrade, a historical ally of Moscow. He said he believed
that ``the Russian position is closer to ours than Milosevic's
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin continued the talks into the late evening with Vice
President Al Gore and a small group of administration officials at
the vice president's residence. The two have worked together on
U.S.-Russian relations since 1993 and have spoken frequently on the
crisis in the Balkans since the allied air campaign began on March
24.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference on Monday afternoon before his meetings
with Chernomyrdin and Jackson, the president brushed aside calls
for a pause in the bombing in response to the release of the
soldiers and other apparent overtures in recent days by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said there would be no allied halt in hostilities until
the Serbian ethnic and religious cleansing of Kosovo ceases and the
1.5 million ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo are allowed to
return in safety.
</P>
<P>
   But the president also seemed to provide at least a small
opening for progress on the diplomatic front, saying that he would
consider a bombing pause ``if it's clear that it will be in aid of
that larger purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's plenty to talk about,'' Clinton said of the Russian
initiative to bring an end to the Balkan conflict.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the composition of a post-war peacekeeping force
was open to negotiation. Last week, Milosevic said in an interview
that he would accept a lightly armed foreign presence in Kosovo,
staffed by non-NATO countries like Russia. While NATO has set out
conditions that would include an armed force with NATO at its core,
Clinton said Monday that such a force could include non-NATO
members including Russia, Ukraine, even Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Administration aides said that political arrangements for Kosovo
could be discussed with Belgrade once the shooting stops.
</P>
<P>
   The president also offered a somewhat softer formulation of
other conditions NATO is demanding as the price for ending the
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that the bombing of Yugoslavia could end if there
were ``clear and unambiguous evidence that a withdrawal is
underway,'' a more moderate variation on previous demands for
withdrawal of all Serbian army and police forces from the province
of Kosovo on a ``precise and rapid timetable.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger, the national security adviser, said that Clinton did not
intend to signal any change in NATO conditions for ending the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a new position,'' Berger said. ``That answer has
been given 50 times.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was attempting to navigate a narrow passage between
resolve on allied war aims and flexibility on terms for ending the
conflict, as calls for a negotiated ceasefire grow and divisions on
the war deepen in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Before meeting with the president, Jackson said, ``We must seize
this moment to take the step to dramatic diplomacy from bloody,
protracted war.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kofi Annan, the secretary-general of the United Nations, said in
New York Monday night after returning from Europe that there was no
immediate prospect of peace in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he welcomed the release of the American prisoners,
but warned, ``We still have a lot of work to do on the political
and the diplomatic front before I can say that we are on the verge
of a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan met late last week with German and Russian leaders,
including Chernomyrdin, but returned to New York with no concrete
proposals for ending the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything,'' he said, ``the trip to Moscow and Berlin has
reconfirmed my belief that we should do whatever we can to find a
political solution because the implications of the alternative are
too frightening to contemplate.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The success of Jackson's free-lance mission to Belgrade to win
freedom for the prisoners, along with a 213-213 vote in the House
on a resolution in support of the allied air campaign last week,
have noticeably changed the climate in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Monday deferred action on a bipartisan resolution
calling on the president to use ground forces, if necessary, to win
the war in the Balkans. The resolution appeared doomed by
opposition from Senate leaders, who appeared more eager for a
negotiated settlement than victory on the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's conduct of the campaign has been questioned from the
beginning. But now that six weeks of bombing have failed to reverse
the wretched exodus from Kosovo, the calls for a quick diplomatic
deal to end the bloodshed are increasing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton welcomed the release of the American prisoners, who were
undergoing medical testing at an American military hospital in
Germany on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But the president said that their release alone was not
sufficient to end the allied air attacks. The two things are
``completely separate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we are very thankful for their release, let me be clear
why the military operations must continue,'' Clinton said. ``Three
Americans are home. Their families, their friends and the American
people, whom they have served faithfully, must be grateful. But
nearly one and a half million Kosovars are not home. When will
these people see their homes again, with the safety and rights Mr.
Milosevic has often pledged, but never delivered?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted he was not seeking ``total victory'' over
Serbia and said he was conducting the war reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not relish every night sending young Americans and our
NATO allies up in planes flying very fast under very hazardous
circumstances in which their safety is at risk,'' the president
said. ``I do not relish the continuing burdens on the people of
Albania and Macedonia. I am eager to get the Kosovars out of the
camps and on their way back home and rebuilding. I do not relish
the thought that inevitably some of those bombs will go astray and
some Serbian civilians, or some Kosovar civilians, could be
killed.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``I am not trying to drag this out. But I am
determined to pursue our policy until we know that we have a chance
to do what has to be done in order for this to work as a practical
matter, and in order finally, to, clearly and unambiguously,
reverse the policy of ethnic and religious cleansing.''

MCI SAID TO WEIGH JOINING COMCAST IN BID FOR MEDIAONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL and GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Setting the stage for a showdown between two of the nation's
biggest communications companies, MCI Worldcom Inc. is seriously
considering joining Comcast Corp. in its multibillion-dollar fight
against AT&AMP;T Corp. to acquire MediaOne Group, the big cable
television company, executives close to the negotiations said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, MediaOne accepted AT&AMP;T's unsolicited $58
billion offer to acquire the company, repudiating its previous $53
billion agreement to be acquired by Comcast, another big cable
carrier. Under terms of its deal with MediaOne, Comcast now has
until the end of Thursday to make a new bid.
</P>
<P>
   Comcast has sought partners ever since AT&AMP;T made its offer two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, MCI Worldcom was close to signing a
confidentiality agreement with MediaOne that would allow MCI
Worldcom to examine MediaOne's secret internal financial
information, according to executives close to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Those executives also said that Paul Allen, a co-founder of
Microsoft and a billionaire entrepreneur, had decided against
helping Comcast fight AT&AMP;T, which far outstrips Comcast in
financial firepower.
</P>
<P>
   The executives said that America Online Inc., the No. 1 Internet
service provider, had also decided against helping Comcast on its
own.
</P>
<P>
   But the executives added that America Online could well join the
Comcast camp if a third company were enlisted to help carry the
financial load.
</P>
<P>
   That third company could end up being MCI Worldcom, the No. 2
long-distance communications company and longtime foe of AT&AMP;T, the
No. 1 long-distance company. Executives close to the discussions
said that MCI Worldcom did not want to help Comcast on its own, but
would potentially be amenable to a three-way partnership,
particularly with America Online. MCI Worldcom and America Online
already have a close relationship as a result of their cooperation
in the purchase of Compuserve.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. has also been weighing a partnership with
Comcast, but the executives close to the talks said MCI Worldcom
was not as interested in teaming with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   For MCI Worldcom, joining a bid for MediaOne would represent a
major change in strategic direction. Bernard Ebbers, the company's
chief executive, has long focused on business customers rather than
residential users. By helping Comcast acquire MediaOne, he would
end up with a significant presence in mass-market cable television.
</P>
<P>
   At some level, the main strategic reason for MCI Worldcom to
jump into the battle may simply be to keep MediaOne out of AT&AMP;T's
hands. Since agreeing to acquire Tele-Communications Inc., the No.
2 cable company, last summer, AT&AMP;T has decided that it will try to
use cable systems across the nation to offer consumers integrated
packages of television, telephone and Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   Though MCI Worldcom owns the world's biggest Internet carrier,
Uunet &UR; / &LR; , the company has not set out a detailed strategy for
offering high-speed Internet service to consumers. Winning access
to MediaOne's roughly 5.5 million customers could help plug that
strategic gap _ while also blocking AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Were MCI Worldcom to win MediaOne, it could be a painful defeat
for AT&AMP;T and its fast-moving chairman, C. Michael Armstrong. Both
he and Ebbers have reputations for being decisive and unafraid of
remaking their companies. A battle over MediaOne would be the first
time the two men go head-to-head in a takeover fight.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's board met Monday. The nature of its discussions was
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom has maintained a relationship with America Online
for years. In 1997, America Online sold its communications network
to what was then Worldcom Inc. in a complex three-way deal that had
Worldcom also acquire the network of Compuserve, a rival online
service. Last year, after Worldcom acquired what was then MCI
Communications Corp., Stephen Case, America Online's chairman,
joined the board of the new MCI Worldcom. Today, America Online is
one of MCI Worldcom's biggest data customers.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Monday whether Microsoft _ which already has a
$1 billion investment in Comcast _ would come to Comcast's aid
independently. Microsoft has the necessary finances to underwrite
an offer, and there has even been some talk that it could make a
separate offer for MediaOne. But a person close to Microsoft said
it would be hard to imagine the company doing that.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has made a number of investments in cable companies,
including NTL Inc., a cable and telephony provider in Britain, but
has always taken a relatively small minority stake. Its $1 billion
investment in Comcast, for example, left it with just 11.5 percent
of the company.
</P>
<P>
   An executive close to the negotiations said that America Online
had ``decided to take a pass'' on joining Comcast independently
because Comcast was asking America Online to commit too many
resources to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Though this person was not specific, other executives close to
the negotiations said that America Online would have been expected
to contribute both stock and cash to the Comcast bid.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Allen did not return phone calls Monday, and a
spokesman for America Online declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   America Online was a more obvious bidder than Microsoft and was
generally thought to have more to lose if AT&AMP;T acquired MediaOne.
America Online is concerned that AT&AMP;T intends to shut independent
Internet providers like America Online out of the cable systems
that it controls. Joining with Comcast could help America Online
keep MediaOne's cable systems out of AT&AMP;T's grasp.
</P>
<P>
   But America Online is also trying to win access to cable systems
in other ways, including normal business negotiations and lobbying
efforts in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Looking forward to the day when many American households have
high-speed access to the Internet, America Online has also struck
deals with some of the nation's biggest local telephone companies,
including Bell Atlantic Corp., to jointly offer Internet service
using an advanced telephone technology known as digital subscriber
lines, or DSL.

LIST OF FINAL WITNESSES RELEASED IN MICROSOFT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. and the government both released
the names Monday of the final witnesses each intends to call when
the antitrust trial resumes later this month. The list indicates
that the government hopes to shore up its case, while Microsoft's
goal, at least in part, is to change the subject of discussion to
one that might make the government's case seem irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising announcement came from Microsoft. The
company is summoning David Colburn _ a senior executive for America
Online and an important government witness earlier in the trial _
to testify as a hostile witness in the final, rebuttal stage of
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Colburn will be questioned about ``the completeness and candor
of prior testimony,'' Microsoft said, and as part of the company's
effort to argue that America Online's purchase of the Netscape
Communications Corp. undermines the government's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our rebuttal witnesses will show that the $10 billion merger
of AOL and Netscape completely undercuts the government's case'' by
showing that ``competition and innovation are stronger than ever in
the software industry,'' said William Neukom, Microsoft's senior
vice president for law and corporate affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will also call Gordon Eubanks, the former chairman of
Symantec Corp., maker of the Norton Utilities programs for Windows,
and Richard Schmalensee, an economist and dean of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management. Schmalensee was
Microsoft's economic witness earlier in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is also recalling its chief economic
witness, Franklin M. Fisher, another MIT economist. It will also
recall Edward Felten, the Princeton University computer scientist
who served as a government witness earlier in the trial, and Gary
Norris, an International Business Machines Corp. executive who was
for several years director of IBM's software strategy division.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said they were confident of their case and
hoped their rebuttal witnesses would shore up areas of weakness
exposed during the earlier part of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   One witness, Felten, is being called in part to rebut any
technical statements Microsoft might make that government lawyers
find questionable. He and his staff found several of the technical
flaws in Microsoft's demonstration tapes played in court earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The overarching goal, government officials said, is to keep the
strong legal advantage they believe they have already gained.
</P>
<P>
   A senior IBM executive, John Soyring, has already testified for
the government, and there is some overlap between the areas he
discussed and the ones Justice Department lawyers intend to raise
with Norris. But they also intend to question him about Microsoft's
efforts to stop IBM from offering software on its computers made by
Microsoft's competitors, according to a filing with the court.
</P>
<P>
   With its witnesses, Microsoft wants to open up new areas of
evidence. A filing with the court shows that the company wants to
use Colburn to help make the case that Netscape, America Online and
the government plotted, in effect, to hide for two months the
developing deal between Netscape and America Online because they
were afraid news of it would hurt the government's case.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department official called that ``a desperate attempt
to distract attention from Microsoft's illegal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing about the transaction has any relevance to the case,''
the official added, ``and nothing about it will break Microsft's
stranglehold on the operating system market.''
</P>
<P>
   Eubanks, now the head of Oblix, a business-directory software
manufacturer, led Symantec during the years when the company sold
utilities that Microsoft later incorporated into the Windows
operating system. But Microsoft wants to show that Symantec then
came up with new ideas, like antivirus software, to replace the
lost business and continued to prosper.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft describes Eubanks as a friend and competitor. In a
filing with the court Monday, Microsoft said Eubanks would testify
about ``the rapid pace of change in the software business, and the
inability of anyone to predict the directions in which computer and
communication technology would evolve over the last 10 years,'' and
``the expansion of the concept of an operating system through the
addition of new features and functions.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Eubanks said, ``Microsoft has done some
bad things,'' but added that the company and its chairman, William
H. Gates III, had been victims of the American tendency to tear
down those who are too successful.
</P>
<P>
   Both Fisher and Schmalensee will have to repair damage they did
to government and Microsoft cases during earlier cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said he did not think Microsoft's behavior had harmed
consumers, a statement he later tried to modify. And Schmalensee
was shown to have offered opinions in previous years that were
opposite the ones he was espousing in court, leading Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson to question his credibility.

 &HT;    Braves Notes: April award a good sign for Smoltz
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ John Smoltz was voted the National League pitcher of
the month for April. The last time that happened, it was his first
step toward a rendezvous with the Cy Young Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said if I had to pick a month, it'd be October,''
said Smoltz, who was 4-0 with a 1.51 ERA last month. ``But I'm
elated with the honor. And to win it in April. . . I usually don't
start out very well.''
</P>
<P>
   With one notable exception. The monthly award was his first
since winning both April and May honors in 1996. He lost his first
start of the season that year, went on a 14-game win streak and
steam-rolled right into a lopsided NL Cy Young vote. The league hit
.200 against him that season. Last month, that average was .177.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had ever seen Smoltz better, manager Bobby Cox said,
``No, he can't pitch better. How could you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree,'' Smoltz said, laughing. ``I've worked very hard to
get to this point. It's such a long year. A realistic part of you
knows you're going to have some bad days. You try to avoid as many
as possible, make the good ones so good that the bad doesn't (seem
as bad).
</P>
<P>
   While Smoltz did post the lowest ERA among NL starters,
Houston's Shane Reynolds (4-1), St. Louis' Kent Bottenfield (4-0),
New York's Dennis Cook and San Diego's Andy Ashby (4-1) all matched
his win total. Bottenfield's ERA was 1.53.
</P>
<P>

   The luxury tax statements were released by Major League
Baseball, indicating that based on their pending 1999 payroll, the
Braves owe $772,000. The Braves say: hogwash.
</P>
<P>
   MLB's estimate was derived from the club's opening day payroll
of $73.59 million, but does not reflect the subtraction of Mark
Wohlers' $5.2 million salary. Though the Braves continue to pay
Wohlers as part of the April 16 trade with Cincinnati, his contract
is designated to the Reds, possibly moving the Braves out of the
luxury tax bracket. Tax assessments are not final until the final
day of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threshhold for the luxury tax is a moving target. It
changes throughout the year,'' said team president Stan Kasten.
``Do the math. Plus, the money we saved (with the trade) is the
$700,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The clubs that would be assessed this year: Los Angeles ($5.15
million), New York Yankees ($4.25 million), Baltimore ($4.07
million), Atlanta and the New York Mets ($525,000). The luxury tax
system, as provided in the game's last basic work agreement,
expires after this year.

   With a new wave of speculation washing over manager Ray Miller's
future in Baltimore, Braves batting coach Don Baylor's name has
again come up as a possible replacement. Though any more regarding
Miller is not expected until Wednesday, Atlanta general manager
John Schuerholz not only denied the Orioles have ever called for
permission to talk with Baylor but downplayed the chance Baylor
would be leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he's a guy who's got managerial experience and
success and probably is a natural lightning rod of attention,''
Schuerholz said. ``Don and I discussed all of this up front when he
joined us. We've got an understanding that if the opportunity
comes. . . But I don't want to make a lot of that because he's
comfortable here.''

DESPITE SNAGS, DE NIRO AND MIRAMAX PLAN BROOKLYN STUDIO
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Although Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, actor Robert De Niro
and Harvey Weinstein of Miramax Films announced a tentative
agreement Monday to build a movie studio at the Brooklyn Navy Yard,
major elements of the deal to transform the cavernous shipbuilding
complex into a glamorous film factory are not in place.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed $150 million project would turn a 15-acre site on
Wallabout Bay into 12 huge sound stages for film and television
production and revive the home of Brooklyn's oldest industry, the
long-closed 129-year-old Navy Yard. But the economics of such a
project and the vagaries of the film industry are daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Even as a news conference got under way Monday near the dry
docks at the Navy Yard, De Niro's company, TriBeCa Productions, and
the developer for the project, Vornado Realty Trust, had not signed
a letter of intent with city officials, despite repeated attempts
during a series of meetings last weekend and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nor had Steven Roth, chairman of Vornado, been able to sign a
separate agreement with the moviemakers, De Niro and Harvey
Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax Films, that detailed the extent
of their involvement in the project.
</P>
<P>
   The financing is not quite in place and two men who started the
project, Louis Madigan and Cary Hart, are objecting to the city's
proposed deal.
</P>
<P>
   That did not stop Giuliani, De Niro, Weinstein or Roth from
declaring their allegiance to Brooklyn and their intentions to
build a Hollywood-style studio where tens of thousands of workers
once labored. The mayor, like nearly every other executive or city
official who went to the microphone, made note of his birth in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``This facility will allow producers to shoot an entire movie,
from start to finish, right here in New York City,'' Giuliani said.
``It will not only encourage new film production in the city; it
will also help revitalize an area that has long been under-used.''
</P>
<P>
   De Niro, whose company produces about five films a year, was
equally ebullient. ``Everything we would do, we would do here,'' he
said. ``That's the whole point. Being part of this is very exciting
for me and great for New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounding a little like the mobster-turned-therapy patient he
played in his latest film, ``Analyze This,'' De Niro added: ``I
could be wrong a little bit here and there. But you cannot fail in
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the still unsigned deal, the venture led by
Vornado would invest $35 million. The Fisher real estate family,
which owns Plaza Construction, would build the project, and become
a partner in the deal. The city, in turn, would provide a $25
million low-interest loan, while Brooklyn Navy Yard Development
Corp. would put in another $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Union Labor Life Insurance Co. is considering investing
providing about $82 million in financing, although it has not yet
made a commitment. Keyspan Energy, which will build the electrical
system, may also invest.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the proposed letter of intent obtained by The New York
Times specifies the role of the city and Vornado, but it does not
say a word about the obligations of TriBeCa Productions. Miramax,
which shoots 10 to 15 films a year, is not even a signatory.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Levine, the deputy mayor for economic development,
acknowledged that there was still lots of work to be done,
including environmental studies and other reviews. ``Hopefully,''
he said, ``we'll be back in a year to break ground.''
</P>
<P>
   But industry executives contend that many of the major film
companies are in the midst of cutbacks.

CONFERENCE ON YOUTH VIOLENCE FOCUSES ON PREVENTIVE MEASURES

<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. _ After a morning spent listening to experts
recommending ways that early childhood education could prevent
youth violence, the state attorneys general gathered here heard a
sobering message from Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Littleton had already taken many of the recommended steps, a
local official said.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Thomas, the district attorney of Jefferson County, Colo.,
where 15 people died in the Columbine High School shootings last
month, told a meeting of the National Association of Attorneys
General that Littleton already had good cooperation between law
enforcement and school officials. The county has one of the few
juvenile assessment centers in the country, a modern program for
handling young offenders. It also has an affluent, well-educated
population, able to provide early education and health care for
their children.
</P>
<P>
   And still two teen-agers killed 12 students and a teacher before
committing suicide. ``Jefferson County had everything in place you
would think you would need to prevent school violence,'' said
Thomas, who addressed the group along with four other law
enforcement officials from Colorado. ``If you had come to me six
weeks ago and asked if this act was possible in our community, I
would have said this was the last place in America where this could
happen. So what I have to say is, this could happen anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' message seemed to illustrate the difficulty that many
public officials have in developing public policies on youth
violence. Although most state attorneys general are limited to
civil law enforcement, not criminal, the national organization
decided last year to make youth violence a major focus, much as it
became known for leading the recent settlement with tobacco
companies.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the remedies the group discussed in the first day of
its two-day conference on youth violence were familiar ones. Thomas
said the roots of the Littleton shootings lay in the American
culture's fascination with violence, and the obsession of many
children with fantasy role-playing games. Tom Strickland, the
recently appointed U.S. attorney for Colorado, called for new
restrictions on gun availability, as proposed by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And a large number of child development experts told the
audience that early childhood education and careful nurturing,
especially around age 3 were the single most important factors in
preventing later alienation from society. Several national studies
have shown that such programs can help children like those from
low-income families become well-integrated into mainstream society,
said Dr. Craig Ramey, director of the Civitan Research Center at
the University of Alabama at Birmingham, a leading institution that
studies developmental disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Moore, the attorney general of Mississippi and the
group's president, said the focus should not focus solely on
multiple slayings in schools, which are often committed by bright
middle-class children. An average of 12 children a day die from
youth-related violence, he and other speakers noted, and many
children committing such crimes could have benefited from the
programs advocated at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us in public life are struggling with how we can be
effective in fighting this problem,'' said Mark Pryor, the Arkansas
attorney general, whose state went through a shooting ordeal last
year in Jonesboro. ``Kids are affected by a set of factors that is
simply mind-boggling in its complexity. All you can do is chip away
at it, and keep coming up with ideas.''

COLUMBINE SHOOTINGS HAUNT `STAR WARS' GALA IN DENVER

<P>
   DENVER _ There were a lot of storm troopers wandering around
without their blaster guns at the ``Star Wars'' Celebration here,
the first convention and exposition dedicated to the 22-year-old
movie series to win the approval and support of the films' creator,
George Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   Through a strange twist of fate, the ``Star Wars'' Celebration
landed in Denver on the same weekend as the National Rifle
Association convention, which drew 7,000 protesters, and just 10
days after the Columbine High School shootings in Littleton, a
suburb 20 minutes away. It was food for thought, not least because
the ``Star Wars'' movies _ whose ``dark side'' leans heavily on the
iconography of the Third Reich, an obsession of the Columbine
killers _ are filled with the kind of shoot-'em-up entertainment
fantasy that many citizens are blaming for society's ills.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the convention, which drew about 40,000 fans to the
Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum here Friday to Sunday,
the specter of Columbine hung over the event like the Death Star.
</P>
<P>
   A petition was circulated urging Decipher, the company that
makes the ``Star Wars'' Customizable Card Game, to create a card
depicting one of the slain students, a 14-year-old ``Star Wars''
fan named Steven Curnow, as a Jedi knight.
</P>
<P>
   A Decipher spokesman said the company declined ``because other
kids would start thinking it's fun to kill him with a blaster''
during game play. Eric Harris, one of the two students who planned
and died in the Littleton attack, included a rant on his Web site
about things he hated, including ``Star Wars'' fans.
</P>
<P>
   At the booth run by Star Wars Insider, the official fan club
magazine, which organized the convention, action figures with guns
were no longer for sale. Dan Hogatt, a 30-year-old foreman at Ford
Motor Co. in Louisville, Ky., who dressed up as a very convincing
Chewbacca complete with a fur head and suit, foam latex hands and
drywall stilts that boosted his height to 8 feet, had to check his
crossbow at the door. (Light sabers were deemed permissible.)
``They asked us not to bring our weapons in here,'' he said. ``And
I was upset, but I totally understand.''
</P>
<P>
   In the search for answers to the Littleton tragedy, convention
goers turned to their favorite film. One speaker told the audience
to always remember the Columbine events and a quote from Yoda that
appears in a trailer for the forthcoming ``Star Wars: Episode I _
The Phantom Menance.'' (The first movie in the new trilogy is set a
generation before the first three ``Star Wars'' films.) ``Fear is
the path of the Dark Side,'' the green Zen master says. ``Fear
leads to anger; anger leads to hate; hate leads to suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end the anticipation that the first ``Star Wars''
prequel would be in theaters in less than three weeks _ on May 19,
a date more anxiously awaited than the millennial New Year's Eve
for most of these fans _ snapped fans out of tragic reality and
into happy fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Some had overcome hardship to attend the celebration. A dying
father from the East Coast took his wife and young children, hoping
that he could give them one last fond memory of being together as a
family. And Joshua Hamilton, a 26-year-old from Denver who works
for a publisher of comic books, wandered through the exhibition
center with his forehead lacerated with fresh cuts, a result of a
car crash just hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our car was totaled,'' said his wife, Kimberly. ``The
ambulance came and put him in a neck brace and strapped him to a
board. They X-rayed both of us at the hospital and said we were OK.
It was worth it. This is a once in a lifetime event.''
</P>
<P>
   As films and personalities race through pop culture leaving a
trail of momentary obsession behind them, ``Star Wars'' has passed
the test of time and has spanned generations. It has worked its
epic tale of the relationships between good and evil, father and
son, man and machine, youth and maturity, and thinking and feeling
into a cultural landmark. Joseph Campbell (whose book ``The Hero
With a Thousand Faces'' seems to have inspired the galaxy-saving
journey of Luke Skywalker) has been perhaps the films' greatest
ally, examining it as a myth as universal as the Upanishads or the
Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like a religion,'' said Won Park, a watercolor
artist who flew in from Honolulu and dressed up as the Jedi master
Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson's character in ``Episode I''). ``If
George Lucas turned this into a religion, it would blow L. Ron
Hubbard's Dianetics out of the window.'' Hubbard, of course, was a
science-fiction writer before he led the Church of Scientology.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Michael Cruz, a 24-year-old fan from New York City with
seven ``Star Wars'' tattoos and a wife in her eighth month of
pregnancy, said they were waiting to watch ``Episode I'' to select
a name for their baby.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the people feverishly wandering through the tents and
airplane hangers housing ``Star Wars'' toy and video game previews,
glass-encased movie props and collectible merchandise seemed to fit
the stereotype of geeky males in their 20s and early 30s. But the
convention drew a racially, sexually, ethnically and generationally
mixed crowd, many in costume although inexplicably there was nary a
Luke Skywalker or C-3PO in sight. It was hard to tell whether a
parent or a child was the ``Star Wars'' fan, and often the answer
was both.

   Most of these conventioneers inhabit an alternate world in which
George Lucas is God. The universe of ``Star Wars'' is one of his
making, the quality of its images and products rigorously
maintained and controlled by his company over the years. The tale
itself _ a fantasy rendered with elaborate realism down to the last
planet, droid and Gungan, each of which has its own background
story _ was created with the kind of methodical obsession with
detail that is the hallmark of an Outsider artist like Henry
Darger.
</P>
<P>
   In his Chicago apartment several decades ago, the reclusive
Darger typed 15,000 single-spaced pages and drew 300 oversize
water-colors carefully detailing of the plight of young slave girls
in outer space and the battle between their captors, the
Glandelinians, and their protectors, the Abbennians, along with all
kinds of supplemental characters and species. The battle myth could
have attracted a ``Star Wars''-like cult complete with
corresponding action figures. But without the benefit of mass
entertainment it attracted only one fan in the artist's lifetime:
Darger himself.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Lucas has the gift of being as focused on the commercial reach
of his work as he is on its inner world. Of the more than 30,000
``Star Wars'' products _ a $4 billion business with rarities that
fetch as much as $25,000 in the case of one Boba Fett action figure
that shoots projectiles that may land in the throats of young
children _ every one has been approved by Lucasfilm.
</P>
<P>
   At the convention, merchants like Hallmark and Hasbro lucky
enough to receive a Lucasfilm license showcased their official
products _ from blow-up pool rafts shaped like Naboo Starfighters
to toothbrushes emblazoned with the likeness of the new character
Jar Jar Binks _ as if they were fragments of the lost ark.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't videotape,'' a representative in a ``Star Wars'' costume
shop told one fan. ``Next thing you know, it will be on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked why anyone would care to post images of costumes of
familiar characters on the Internet, the representative replied,
``I don't know, they told me to say that,'' ``they'' referring to
Lucasfilm officials. ``It's all been hush-hush.'' Merchants were
under strict orders not to sell or even discuss merchandise from
the forthcoming movie, some of which conveniently went on sale in
stores on Monday, the day after the convention ended. The
convention may have been a way to repay diehard fans, as editors at
Star Wars Insider said, but it was also a way to stick them with
the bill by waving new collectibles under their noses.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I placed my orders without knowing what the product was going
to look like,'' said Kyle Puttkammer, owner of a store called
Galactic Quest in Atlanta. ``But now that I've seen them, I'm going
to increase my order.'' As he spoke, passers-by paused to take
photos of Puttkammer, who was dressed as a young Obi-Wan Kenobi,
and his 10-month-old daughter, dressed as Yoda, in her stroller.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being treated to never-before-screened scenes
from the closely guarded film, audience members could attend
question-and-answer sessions with many who worked on the film,
including Jake Lloyd (who plays Anakin Skywalker, Luke's father and
the future Darth Vader), Ray Park (the villain Darth Maul), Rick
McCallum (the movie's producer), Anthony Daniels (the voice of
C-3P0) and Pernilla August (Anakin's mother, Shmi Skywalker).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. August was actually asked what it felt like to be the
grandmother of Luke Skywalker. ``Star Wars'' buffs may be able to
distinguish between fantasy and reality, but it was clear which
side they preferred. When an audience member asked Park whether his
character, the devilish-looking, double-light-saber-wielding Darth
Maul, would be returning in Episode II, the audience broke into
confused murmurs. ``What do you want to hear?'' asked the master of
ceremonies, Daniels. ``The truth or a lie?''
</P>
<P>
   Roaring through the tent came the overwhelming reply of over a
thousand fans screaming in unison, ``A lie!''

CLINTON SEES POSSIBLITY OF BOMBING PAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Giving his strongest hint yet of flexibility,
President Clinton Monday said he was open to a pause in NATO's
bombing campaign if there was ``clear and unambigious'' evidence
that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic would begin withdrawing
troops from Kosovo, allow the refugees to return home and agree to
an international peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   As Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, Russia's special envoy to Kosovo,
arrived at the White House for talks with Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore, Clinton said, ``We could have a bombing pause if
it's clear that it will be an aid of that larger purpose.'' White
House aides later downplayed any change in the US position on
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   After their meeting, Chernomyrdin said the two men were ``closer
to a diplomatic solution'' to end the Kosovo conflict and that he
would resume the conversation with Gore. The former prime minister
said he had brought Clinton a letter from Russian President Boris
Yeltsin that contained concrete proposals to end the air war.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very complicated issue,'' Chernomyrdin said. ``We will
keep on working. ``We remain hopeful. The stakes are very high.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton later met with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who
hand-delivered a letter from Milosevic requesting a meeting with
the president. Jackson afterward suggested the president should
call Milosevic to thank him for releasing the three American POWS
on Sunday. Such a conversation, he said, could lead to further
talks between the two men. Jackson said Clinton told him he would
think about it.
</P>
<P>
   But before the meeting, White House spokesman Joseph Lockhart
said Milosevic knew what he had to do to end the bombing and asked,
``What is there to talk about?''
</P>
<P>
   As Jackson was flying to Washington to meet with Clinton, the
released soliders, who had been imprisoned for 32 days in Belgrade,
were reunited with their families Monday in Germany and passed
preliminary medical examinations. The three servicemen are Steven
Gonzales, 22, of Huntsville, Texas; Andrew Ramirez, 24, of Los
Angeles; and Christopher Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said X-rays shows that Stone had suffered a broken
nose and that Ramirez had broken ribs. Both injuries were now
healing. Ramirez also had a swollen right leg and doesn't remember
how it happened.
</P>
<P>
   But more good weather allowed NATO to keep its promise not to
``reward'' Milosevic for releasing the soldiers and continued with
its punishing assaults on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav media reported NATO warplanes mistakenly hit a bus,
killing at least 17 people and injuring 21 others. NATO officials
said they had no information on the bus traveling from the western
Kosovo city of Pec to Rozaje in neighboring Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav reports said the bus was full of women and children and
that rescue teams were unable to reach the scene right away because
the bombing continued. Three civilian and two police vehicles also
were hit during the airstrikes, which were thought to be aimed at a
nearby police and army checkpoint, according to those reports.
</P>
<P>
   If the report is true, this would be the second bus hit by
alliance bombs in three days. NATO officials have admitted a stray
missile hit a bus north of Pristina on Saturday. Serb sources said
39 people were killed in that incident. In all, the alliance has
admitted that mistaken airstrikes since April 12 have left about
159 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, work crews struggled Monday to restore power to the
Yugoslav capital and large parts of Serbia after an attack on the
Belgrade power grid caused a massive blackout Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has promised to target military sites and installations and
tried to minimize disruptions to civilians, but the latest bombing
of electrical sites temporarily affected 70 percent of Serbia,
alliance officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In a new style of airstrikes, NATO warplanes dropped ``soft
bombs'' that explode above electric power plants, spraying graphite
strips that short-circuit power stations. The bombs, which also
were used in the Persian Gulf War, struck Kostolac's power grid 50
miles east of the capital that supplies much of eastern Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO bombers also hit electricity transformer yards as well the
towns of Nis, Novi Sad, Drmno, Obrenovac and Banina Basta.
</P>
<P>
   This shows that ``NATO has its finger on the light switch in
Yugoslavia now, and we can turn the power off whenever we need to
and whenever we want to,'' said NATO spokesman Jamie Shea.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments Monday:
</P>
<P>
   --The Pentagon ordered to active duty an Air Force Reserve
search-and- rescue group, raising to 2,236 the number of reservists
mobilized for the Kosovo conflict. The call-up of 120 members of
the 939th Rescue Wing based in Portland, Ore., comes after one US
warplane crashed in Serbia over the weekend and another was hit by
ground fire but landed safely.
</P>
<P>
   --The Senate for the first time since the airstrikes began,
debated a measure that would allow Clinton to use ``all necessary
force'' to resolve the Kosovo conflict. But lawmakers are expected
to avoid voting directly on the resolution through a procedural
maneuver. Senator Paul Wellstone, a Minnesota Democrat, called on
Clinton to consider a pause in the bombing ``to improve the
environment for diplomatic discussions now underway.''
</P>
<P>
   -- A surprise night train from Kosovo poured more refugees into
Macedonia, where some 11,000 ethnic Albanians, many of them women
and children, were backed up at the main border crossing. The UN's
refugee agency said 2,000 people had arrived during the night,
adding to the 5,000 who were already camped out in a temporary
holding center at the Blace checkpoint between Macedonia and
Kosovo. NATO said it planned to build camps in Albania for another
160,000 refugees, including up to 60,000 now in Macedonia.

<P>
   --In Macedonia, British Prime Minister Tony Blair visited the
teeming Stankovic camp and said Britain would double its cash aid
to $64.5 million and also take in an unspecified additional number
of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   --Germany's Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping said his country
will commit 600 more troops to international efforts to aid Kosovo
refugees in Macedonia and Albania. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's
cabinet is expected to discuss the extra deployment Tuesday, with a
parliamentary vote this week.
</P>
<P>
   --Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi told Clinton during a
summit meeting between the two leaders that Japan would contribute
$200 million to aid the refugee crisis.
</P>
<P>
   During a joint news conference with Obuchi, Clinton said, he was
not trying to achieve ``total victory'' over Milosevic. ``What I am
asking for are the minimal conditions necessary for the Kosovars to
be able to go home and live in security with self-government; that
is, they won't go home unless the Serb security forces are
withdrawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger
later said the president's comments was not a softening of his
position. ``We need verifiable evidence that he is withdrawing,''
Berger said of Milosevic. ``We're not even close to that point.''

SUCCESSION FIGHT ROILS WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ A leadership crisis disrupted operations of the World
Trade Organization on Monday after weekend negotiations collapsed,
with no breakthrough in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the New Zealand and Thai finalists for the post of
director- general at the 134-nation group both insisted their
candidate should win.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats fear that the brawl at the four-year-old organization,
which makes rules and arbitrates disagreements in international
commerce, could stall resolution of many trade disputes and
jeopardize preparations for new trade talks set for Seattle in
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether this is resolved quickly or without blood on the
floor, it could impact on the climate for preparations,'' said
Pakistan's trade envoy, Munir Akram, whose country backs the Thai
candidate. Carlos Perez del Castillo, Uruguay's top trade delegate,
who backs the candidate from New Zealand, said, ``The WTO is
absolutely paralyzed.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the organization's rules, the term of the outgoing
director-general, Renato Ruggiero of Italy, which was to expire
Friday, was extended through Monday because a successor had not
been chosen. He appointed a caretaker administrator to handle
routine chores, but only a new director-general can make important
decisions, such as selecting arbitrators for disputes and admitting
new members.
</P>
<P>
   Animosity over who would replace Ruggiero first broke into the
open Friday when the organization's selection committee said one
candidate, Mike Moore, a former New Zealand prime minister, had the
highest and broadest geographical support among member nations.
Supporters of Moore's rival, Supachai Panitchpakdi, Thailand's
deputy prime minister and commerce minister, furiously rejected the
choice, contending that the 62-59 vote among member countries was
dubious and too close to declare Moore victorious.
</P>
<P>
   Groups of countries supporting each candidate caucused Monday,
each accusing the other of hardball tactics. On Sunday, countries
backing Moore urged delegates not to resort to a precedent-setting
and potentially divisive vote that Supachai's supporters are
demanding.
</P>
<P>
   The trade organization has sought to avoid a formal vote for
fear that it could set big trading powers like the United States
and the European Union against the smaller, but more numerous,
developing countries, creating polarizing frictions that would
undermine its legitimacy. Traditionally, the organization tries to
make important decisions by consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Both finalists insisted they would fight to the end, suggesting
there was no room for compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not pulling out,'' Supachai said. Moore, in a telephone
interview from New Zealand's mission in Geneva, said: ``We're
stronger than before. The issue now is whether you support the
rules or not.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of countries backing Moore, which included Uruguay,
Venezuela, France, Turkey and Sweden, issued a statement urging
Supachai to withdraw. ``If Moore is vetoed, there is no way
Supachai will be the next director-general,'' said Perez del
Castillo of Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
   Supachai's backers, led by developing countries, have become
increasingly angry over what they view as a bias against him by the
large trading powers, particularly the United States. Zimbabwe's
envoy, T.J.B. Jokonya, complained Saturday that a ``most deadly
arsenic diatribe was unleashed on those who dared to oppose the
wish of the anointed.'' He was referring to efforts by supporters
of Moore to defeat Supachai.
</P>
<P>
   Many nations supporting Supachai were stunned at the choice of
the selection committee because the 52-year-old Thai economist had
reportedly been ahead since the process of country-by-country
consultation got under way last fall. Many believed the selection
was purposely delayed in order to garner more support for Moore,
50.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big boys thought it would all be decided behind closed
doors, like last time,'' Akram of Pakistan said. ``But the WTO has
evolved and it's time for a developing country choice.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bangkok, politicians argued that it was time to review ties
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, an influential supporter of Supachai, was sticking by its
candidate. Yoichi Suzuki, a trade diplomat from Japan, said, ``We
have more problems with the process than the candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki said the vote tally announced Friday ``shows that it's
finely balanced,'' adding, ``You can't tell who is winning.''

SEVERAL BIG AUTOMAKERS POSTED ROBUST APRIL SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ In a further sign of consumers' willingness to keep
spending in a robust economy, auto sales maintained their sizzling
pace in April.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co., DaimlerChrysler AG, Toyota, Honda and Nissan,
along with a number of smaller automakers, reported strong sales
Monday, and the industry as a whole is on track to match or beat
its vigorous sales pace of last April.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said its sales rose 6.6 percent last month to 345,672
compared with the corresponding period a year ago. Those figures
included Volvo sales, since Ford's acquisition of the Swedish
automaker was completed March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding Volvo's results, Ford's sales rose 4.1 percent, with
car sales falling 1 percent and sales of sport utility vehicles,
minivans and pickup trucks rising 7.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler said sales at its American unit, Chrysler, rose
2.0 percent to 225,195. Mercedes-Benz sales dropped 0.8 percent in
the United States last month. Excluding the Mercedes' results,
DaimlerChrysler's car sales rose 5.9 percent and its truck sales
edged up 0.4 percent to record levels.
</P>
<P>
   Honda sales have set records each month this year. In April,
sales rose 4.0 percent to 90,352. Honda's car sales fell 3.1
percent but were offset by a 52.9 percent rise in truck sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confidence in the economy remains strong and continues to
drive consumer demand for big-ticket items,'' said Dick Colliver,
executive vice president for American Honda.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota sales rose 9.6 percent to 118,833. Nissan sales rose 21.5
percent to 47,243. ``There's a lot to celebrate,'' said David
Bradley, an auto analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Auto stocks generally rose Monday. Ford was up $2.75, to
$66.6875, and DaimlerChrysler increased $1.9375 to $100.125.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Corp. is scheduled to report its April sales
results Tuesday. GM put on hefty discounts last April, which
jump-started its sluggish sales, and will have a tough time
improving on its results year-over-year. Indeed, Wall Street
analysts expect GM's sales to drop as much as 3 percent. Bradley
said that ``even if the numbers are down a bit, they would still be
very strong numbers.'' Shares rose $4.6875, to $93.75.
</P>
<P>
   Month after month, this year's auto sales results have surprised
even the experts: auto industry economists have repeatedly raised
their industry sales forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing it pretty much every month this year as the
results kept coming in stronger and stronger,'' said W. Van
Bussmann, corporate economist at DaimlerChrysler. In December, he
predicted the industry would sell 14.8 million cars, trucks,
minivans and sport utility vehicles this year. He has raised his
forecast four times since then, to 15.6 million cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Economists at Ford and GM have also increased their estimates.
Ford began the year predicting the industry would sell between 14.6
million and 15.1 million cars and light trucks this year. In
mid-March, it added a half-million vehicles, and just a few weeks
after that said sales would likely fall at the top end of the
range, or 15.6 million, in line with Chrysler's predictions.
</P>
<P>
   GM's forecast mirrored Ford's at the beginning of the year, and
economists there now expect the industry to sell between 15.3
million and 15.9 million cars and light trucks this year.
</P>
<P>
   During the first quarter, sales reached an annual pace of 16.6
million, well above last year's first-quarter sales of 14.9
million. Even if the pace slows somewhat later this year, the
industry could break its all-time sales record of 16 million cars
and light trucks, set in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly is a possibility that we'll exceed that 1986
record,'' said Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, a senior economist at Ford.

SBC-TELMEX DEAL SEEKS PHONE CARRIER IN PUERTO RICO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Calif., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Betting on both wireless phones and the Caribbean economy, SBC
Communications Inc. said Monday that it had joined with Telefonos
de Mexico SA in an agreement to acquire Cellular Communications of
Puerto Rico Inc., the biggest wireless phone carrier on that island
and in the United States Virgin Islands, for $464 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, including $350 million in assumed debt, was the first
move into the Caribbean for SBC, the No. 2 local phone company in
the United States after Bell Atlantic Corp. SBC is the dominant
local phone company in Texas and California and owns 10 percent of
Telefonos de Mexico, or Telmex, Mexico's dominant phone company.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular Communications, which is based in New York and does
business under the Cellular One brand name, lost about $30.9
million last year on revenue of $155.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   For SBC, the deal would not seem to have a short-term impact
comparable to the company's deal in January to acquire Comcast
Corp.'s East Coast wireless business for $400 million. But a
significant presence in Puerto Rico could eventually help SBC
expand into other areas of the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as significantly, SBC's senior management may believe
that it can run the Puerto Rican wireless business better than can
the company's current management.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, however, Edward E. Whitacre Jr., SBC's chairman,
praised Cellular Communications' current leadership and said the
company was poised to expand into the standard telephone business.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Cellular Communications'
shareholders would receive $29.50 in cash for each of their shares.
The stock rose 17.9 percent, or $4.25, to $28 in heavy trading
Monday. Telmex's American depositary receipts were up 4.6 percent,
or $4.25, to $80 on the New York Stock Exchange, where SBC was down
1.6 percent, or $1, to $54.75.
</P>
<P>
   SBC and Telmex did not specify how they intended to split their
ownership, saying only that Telmex would own at least 25 percent of
the Caribbean venture.
</P>
<P>
   SBC declined to comment on reports that it might be negotiating
to join the European partnership of Deutsche Telekom and Telecom
Italia, but executives close to the company said SBC was not
discussing a partnership with the European communications giants.

COMPLETE WNBA DRAFT CAN BE EXPERIENCED ONLINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, the Women's NBA plans a live cybercast of its
draft on the league's official site (www.wnba.com).
</P>
<P>
   The league is billing the event as the first major-sport draft
exclusively on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   OK, before anyone starts a debate on the WNBA's place as a major
league, consider that the league faced a possible shutdown during
negotiations with players on a collective bargaining agreement.
That's right. The league had labor issues with its players and the
dispute jeopardized the season, which is scheduled to begin May 26.
From this vantage, that qualifies the WNBA as a major sports
league.
</P>
<P>
   Having made that point, the league's cybercast, which starts at
10 a.m. Tuesday, should be worth a visit if only to see how it
works.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see clips on the news _ in parts,'' said Stefanie
Scheer, director of Internet Services for NBA Entertainment. ``This
is unique because it's the only way to watch the draft from
beginning to end.''
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA site plans user-directed video, live audio coverage, a
draft toteboard, live chats with draft selections and lots of
digital photos.
</P>
<P>
   WNBA.com's resources for such an effort are in place. The site
is a sister production of NBA.com in cooperation with NBA
Entertainment and ESPN Internet Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   During the event, broadcasters Mike Breen and Meghan Pattyson
are scheduled to give selection-by-selection announcements and
analysis with occasional updates from news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Users tired of talking heads can try the site's WNBA.cam, a
robotic camera that can be remotely controlled with a computer
mouse. The camera provides multiple still images that users can
access.
</P>
<P>
   The site also has a decent warmup act: scouting reports and
photos from the WNBA's predraft camp last month, biographies and
video highlights of eligible prospects, polls and message boards.
</P>
<P>
   Scheer said it's difficult to predict how many will view the
draft. The technique might be applied to draft coverage on NFL.com
or NBA.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be looking at it carefully,'' Scheer said.
</P>
<P>
   OTHER WNBA RESOURCES: Keep in mind that WNBA.com isn't the only
place for women's basketball fans to follow the league. While the
league doesn't match its male counterpart in fan-authored sites, a
few unofficial efforts stand out.
</P>
<P>
   BEST FANZINE: The 3 Pointer (www.the3pointer.com) is an
excellent resource for hardcore WNBA fans. Compiled by Sylvia Cagle
of Sacremento, Calif., her fanzine has sections on each WNBA team,
fan-written articles _ with headlines such as ``WNBA Poetry'' and
``This is not your father's NBA'' _ and links to players and team
pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the players are so reachable, we've been fortunate to
have a lot of contributions from players themselves,'' Cagle said.
</P>
<P>
   BEST PLAYER SITE: Surprisingly, the best fan page isn't of
Sheryl Swoopes or Rebecca Lobo. The Sue Wicks Fan Page
(www.monmouth.com/~dkochan), created and well-designed by Diana
Kochan in adoration of the New York Liberty forward, has the best
collection of links and background data of any active player.
</P>
<P>
   BEST TEAM SITE: The Phoenix Mercury Fan Page
(www.allsports.com/wnba/mercury/wnba.html) is one Mercury fan's
update on her favorite team, the WNBA and women's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   MOST INTERESTING TEAM SITE: The Sisters of No Mercy
(www.sistersofnomercy.com) is an odd, yet interesting creation that
follows the Mercury. The site is maintained by season ticketholders
Jan Newman and Beth Ells of Phoenix who dress as nuns at the games.
Known as Mother Mary Hoops and Sister Three Point, they show up at
home games waving rulers or signs and giving referees the business.
</P>
<P>
   BULLISH FOR BELFOUR: If you think Internet stocks are going
through the roof, shares of Stars goalie Ed Belfour are going for
$165.20 a pop on Wall Street Sports (www.wallstreetsports.com).
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street Sports is a free online game in which members
(450,000) participate in a sports stock market where pro athletes
are traded as securities for fun and prizes. Values are determined
by an athlete's performance and/or the demand for his stock.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour's shares have the third-highest value among NHL players.
Buffalo Sabres goaltender Dominik Hasek's shares go for $203.21
apiece and Colorado Avalanche goaltender Patrick Roy shares are
worth $195.12 each.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour's price-to-earnings ratio ... uh, goals-against-average
must be driving the price.

   DOW CROSSES 11,000 MARK JUST 24 DAYS AFTER 10,000
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average blew past the 11,000 mark, just
24 trading days after it topped 10,000 for the first time. The 10
percent move from March 29 was not the fastest such rise in market
history, but it was the quickest jump of 10 percent to come during
a period of prolonged market strength. The Dow rose 225.65 points,
or 2 percent, to 11,014.69, led by cyclical stocks. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index gained 19.45 points, to 1,354.63, but the

   SOME COMPANIES EASING WORKLOAD
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a decade of piling responsibilities on workers, a
smattering of American companies are beginning to worry about the
consequences, ranging from a lack of creativity to burnout. And
several companies are experimenting with ways to alleviate outsized
workloads, including everything from explicitly limiting work to 40

<P>
   CLINTON AND OBUCHI TALK STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan
professed to be in agreement on strategies to pull Japan out of a
seven-year slump and deregulate its economy. But their meeting
underscored how many of Clinton's initiatives with Tokyo have been
sunk by the Japanese recession.
</P>
<P>
   FORD GAIN LEADS SIZZLING AUTO SALES
</P>
<P>
   Auto sales maintained their sizzling pace in April. Ford
reported a 6.6 percent rise, and gains were also reported by
DaimlerChrysler, Toyota, Honda, Nissan and several smaller auto
makers, putting the industry on track to match or beat its vigorous
sales pace of last April. GM is to report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   MANUFACTURING AND INCOME RISE
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing grew in April for the third consecutive month, and
personal income and spending and construction spending all rose in
March, a private industry survey and government reports showed.
Personal incomes rose four-tenths of a percent in March after
rising five-tenths of a percent in February, the Commerce
Department said.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT AND U.S. NAME WITNESSES
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and the government released the names of the final
witnesses each intends to call when the antitrust trial resumes
later this month. The list indicates that the government hopes to
shore up its case, while Microsoft's goal, at least in part, is to
argue that America Online's purchase of Netscape Communications
undercuts the government's case.
</P>
<P>
   VENCOR PLANS TO MISS DEBT PAYMENT
</P>
<P>
   Vencor, one of the largest operators of nursing homes, said it

concerns about its ability to survive.

   ORANIA, South Africa _ There is still a whites-only enclave in
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   It is here _ a privately owned village of aging prefabricated
houses in a part of the country so harsh that few people of any
race have ever wanted to call it home. And it is growing.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, there is even a housing shortage, so Wynand van
der Westhuysin is building his own home, slapping the cement
between the bricks while his wife holds the trowel to keep it in
place.
</P>
<P>
   The 600 people of Orania are so committed to keeping blacks out
that they are even willing to do all their own work, including
cleaning and gardening, jobs that many white South Africans have
never done for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just knew this was right,'' said van der Westhuysin, who
lost his job in a factory 50 miles north of here last year and
decided to move to Orania soon after. His wife, Marie, agreed.
``There are just the nicest people here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most South Africans have gotten on with the awkward business of
living in a racially and ethnically diverse democracy, where
flipping the television dial can get you any one of 11 national
languages. Some shows even make a point of having characters hold
conversations apparently oblivious to the fact that one is speaking
English and the other Afrikaans.
</P>
<P>
   But a sizable number of Afrikaners _ the descendants of Dutch,
German and French settlers who ruled this country for more than
four decades, ruthlessly imposing strict racial segregation _ still
hanker for a piece of land they can call their own. They want a
place where whites can be in charge.
</P>
<P>
   As the country gets ready for its second post-apartheid
elections in June, recent surveys suggest that as many as 75
percent of Afrikaners still support to some extent the idea of
having a zone or region where Afrikaners could enjoy significant
autonomy. In Pretoria, where comparable surveys were conducted in
1995 and in late 1998, researchers say those who fully support such
a scheme appear to have grown from 33 percent to 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not that many are willing to pull up stakes and move here. In
1994, 300 people lived in Orania. The figure has doubled, but even
in the middle of the day, the streets have the feeling of a ghost
town.
</P>
<P>
   In their mind's eye, though, the founders of this village see
several hundred thousand of the country's Afrikaners settling in
the vast empty stretches of the Northern Cape Province so they can
rule by majority within a democracy. At the moment, Afrikaners _
just 7 percent of South Africa's population _ are scattered
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, supporters of an Afrikaner homeland, or volkstaat,
are largely tolerated. The government pays little attention to
Orania and the village continues to receive government money for
roads and other infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution includes language that might open the way for
the creation of enclaves with strong ethnic identity (It was a
last-minute concession during the negotiations preceding the 1994
elections.) But the issue hangs unresolved and largely unaddressed.
</P>
<P>
   There is one opposition party that has consistently championed
the volkstaat, the Freedom Front. But much in the way that
President Nelson Mandela's governing African National Congress has
been busy stroking its chief black rival party, the Inkatha Freedom
Party, by letting the party's leader, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, be
Acting President every time Mandela and his deputy, Thabo Mbeki,
leave the country, the ANC has taken a soft approach to the Freedom
Front as well.
</P>
<P>
   Far from denouncing party officials as racist, ANC officials
tend to jolly them along. Mandela is said to be fond of the Freedom
Front leader, Constand Viljoen, a former army general who manages
an air of grandfatherly sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   Recently parliament finally debated the subject in a very brief
and very controlled session. A dozen speakers were allowed about
five minutes each at a microphone. The big event was supposed to be
a speech by Mbeki, who is virtually certain to become the country's
next president. But he gave only a short address that said little
on the subject. Still, he did not close the door on it either: it
is, after all, an election year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The residents of Orania say they are not surprised by the lack
of official movement on the volkstaat issue. They see themselves
replaying Afrikaner history, starting off again as pioneers willing
to sacrifice comfort for freedom just as their ancestors did 160
years ago when they took off across South Africa trying to flee
British rule. They are going ahead without formal authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The volkstaat will not be given to us by the ANC,'' said Renus
Steyn, who was among the founders of Orania in 1991. ``We will have
to work for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Steyn concedes that some of Orania's residents are racists. But
he says that is not what this village is about. Like many other
residents here, he makes the analogy to how Jews sought and
achieved a homeland.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, he says, mixed-race South Africans, many of
whom speak Afrikaans and follow many Afrikaner traditions, could
live there too, he said, and even have voting rights. But they must
not be in the majority, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was founded, the village has had turbulent years. In
the beginning, there were all sorts of disputes between the
original settlers, who fractured into at least seven religious
factions and sundry political factions.
</P>
<P>
   And the remoteness of the place has proved crushing
economically. In the last few years, Steyn said, hundreds of people
who had moved here were asked to leave because they could not make
a living and were becoming a burden.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, however, the community is more stable. The village
more carefully screens its potential residents _ many of whom
intend to farm, like the van der Westhuysins, who already have
their first crop of green peppers planted in the five acres they
bought. Real estate is a bit more pricey here than just down the
road, Steyn said.
</P>
<P>
   But some of Orania's residents have big plans. Andre Coetsee and
his 11 partners have spent more than $1 million building a
state-of-the-art dairy here. There are currently nearly 500 cows on
the property, but 1,000 is the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Two Afrikaner women have been hired to do the milking because,
Coetsee said, ``women are naturally'' adept at this kind of work.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors are shown a photo album documenting every stage of the
building process, which seems as much as anything a way of proving
that the owners did the work themselves, from laying the foundation
to putting on the roof. Coetsee was a flight engineer before moving
here in 1995, after years of being intrigued by the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``A real Afrikaner will never be at ease in a system where the
power is in someone else's hands,'' he said. ``In whatever
organization, if he can't be part of the top, he will be unhappy.''

   NOVI SAD, Yugoslavia _ People were out in the sunny weather here
Monday, on this national holiday to mark May Day, but few could
hide their anxieties.
</P>
<P>
   This holiday, on Monday because May 1 fell on a Saturday this
year, is usually a time for picnics and long walks in the lush
spring countryside in Serbia. But in Novi Sad on Monday, people
lined up for water, clutching their plastic containers and bottles
at a well on the side of a street.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the apartment blocks at the end of the street, dense
black smoke still poured from an oil refinery, hit by NATO missiles
over and over, most recently Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``For eight days we have not had water _ the whole of Novi Sad
has no water,'' said Mila Radavanovic-Zecevic, an economist who
lives in this city, the second-largest in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then last night the electricity was cut, at 10 o'clock.
And we have had none today.'' The telephone also went dead, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Novi Sad was plunged into darkness, like 70 percent of the
country, when NATO bombing knocked out the national electricity
grid on Sunday night. The national power company said that NATO had
dropped bombs containing carbon, causing a short circuit in the
distribution network.
</P>
<P>
   The company said its engineers had restored power to 30 percent
of the people who had lost it by early Monday, but appealed for
patience and for people to use power sparingly. During the day the
grid collapsed again, the company said, and power failed through
most of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity was restored to some areas of Belgrade on Monday,
but the supply remained intermittent and whole districts were still
without it by evening. For those who had electricity, President
Slobodan Milosevic could be seen on state television discussing the
problem with the ministers responsible, but few people in the
capital appeared concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll manage,'' said one young woman in the street.
</P>
<P>
   In Novi Sad, though, a city of 300,000, people are beginning to
realize that the problem could last. ``It is awful,'' said Ms.
Radavanovic-Zecevic. ``We don't know if and when it will be
stopped, and we do not know what will happen on any one day or
hour.''
</P>
<P>
   She was with her family, sitting on the terrace of a cafe on the
banks of the Danube. It is one of their favorite spots, with little
boats tied to a wooden wharf and with a view of the city's modern
suspension bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The view was changed drastically a few weeks ago when NATO bombs
destroyed the bridge. ``It was a nice spot but now it is not
nice,'' said Ms. Radavanovic-Zecevic.
</P>
<P>
   Now she comes down here to fetch water from the Danube to use to
flush the toilet at home. For drinking water, her family and other
residents have been lining up to use one of about 10 wells in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   But the Zecevic family said they are worried that things will
only deteriorate further. Ms. Radavanovic-Zecevic is the Yugoslav
representative of the Swiss company F. Hoffmann-La Roche, and she
worried that the company would have to stop importing medicines and
veterinary drugs. Without power or communications, she said, she
doubted that the banks could function and that international
payments could go through.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter, Maja, was pregnant and said she feared the
consequences for her health and her baby's.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning we had everything we needed,'' she said. ``We
had food, the medical structures, telephones and the infrastructure
of civilized life, and my feeling was I was safe here for myself
and my baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now I am afraid that it is not safe,'' she said, ``and
there will not be the hygienic standards and medical standards I
will need in a month or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother added: ``The worst thing is that NATO is targeting
the psychology of people. Now we feel anger, which is not
characteristic, and we think all the world is our enemy, and that
is not good for people.''
</P>

<P>
   Local journalists say that there are signs of a change of mood
in the country after a month of bombing, with people forced now to
concentrate on issues of daily survival, but that they do not see
people moving to press the government to yield to NATO's
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think when we are in a war and have bombs falling, that
we can think about politics?'' said Ms. Radavanovic-Zecevic.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets, the mood is one of resigned hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did they have to destroy it so completely, without any
chance to repair it?'' asked Milenko Mrdjanov, a retired lawyer as
he looked at another destroyed bridge, this one in the center of
the town.
</P>
<P>
   Some people remain upbeat, though. ``We have a small problem but
we'll manage to solve it,'' said Ivan Bojanovic, an electrician who
crossed the Danube on a raft provided by the Yugoslav Army, to do a
job on the far bank.

   WASHINGTON _ Three American soldiers freed from a Yugoslav
prison over the weekend met with their families in Germany on
Monday, and their commander suggested they had been mistreated
while in custody.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers, who were released by President Slobodan Milosevic
on Sunday after a personal appeal from the Rev. Jesse Jackson,
appeared before reporters with family members at a U.S. Army
medical center in Landstuhl.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. David Grange, commander of the soldiers' unit, said
there were indications that their captors had mistreated the
soldiers even though the men have said otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them were poorly treated at the beginning, but that
will be determined,'' Grange said at a news conference in
Landstuhl.
</P>
<P>
   The three soldiers are Specialist Steven M. Gonzales, 22, of
Huntsville, Texas; Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los
Angeles; and Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek,
Mich. Army officials are interviewing them, a process that could
take a few days.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon the spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, said,
``Everything we have learned so far suggests that these soldiers
were illegally detained in Macedonia.''
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers were captured 32 days ago while on patrol near the
border of Macedonia and Serbia. Bacon said military officials are
still determining the circumstances of their capture.
</P>
<P>
   Once the soldiers finish their interviews, Bacon said, each will
get 30 days' leave, presumably in the United States. He expects the
soldiers to rejoin their units after that.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon also said two Yugoslav soldiers who were captured last
month by Kosovo rebels and turned over to NATO by the Albanian
government are being held in Germany. He did not say when they
might be freed.  &QL;

on the playground of his school last week. In the wake of the
schootings in Littleton, Colo., the Millers have refused to allow
Max to play video games which depict violence. The roots of the

Jefferson County, Colo., where the Columbine High School shootings
took place. (Dan Krauss/New York Times Photo)

Celebrity and controversy have followed Dr. Allen Steere, in his
laboratory at the Tufts School of Medicine, from the time he gave
Lyme disease its name to his recent work on a Lyme vaccine. After
leading the research efforts on the vaccine, Steere then came under
fire for his theory that some people with Lyme disease in fact have
a post-disease syndrome. His theory has prompted some insurance
companies to cease coverage. (Rick Friedman/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT20) MILL VALLEY, Calif. -- May 3, 1999 -- SCHOOL-VIOLENCE,
5-03 -- Deanna Miller and her husband Max greet their son Max, 9,
on the playground of his school last week. In the wake of the
schootings in Littleton, Colo., the Millers have refused to allow
Max to play video games which depict violence. The roots of the
Littleton shootings lay in the American culture's fascination with
violence and the obsession of many children with fantasy
role-playing games said Dave Thomas, the district attorney of
Jefferson County, Colo., where the Columbine High School shootings
took place. (Dan Krauss/New York Times Photo)

Fifty years ago fewer than a quarter of Americans lived in the
suburbs. But by 1992, half of America's voters lived there. So as

OUTDATED, TRIVIAL, ADORED: THE BEST-DRESSED LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CATHY HORYN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Although nobody was wearing white gloves or
reminiscing about the good old days, last week's committee meeting
of the Best-Dressed List definitely had a deja vu feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was in a time warp,'' said one participant,
among a dozen or so society figures and journalists who convened in
secret at the Fifth Avenue apartment of Eleanor Lambert to decide
who belongs and who doesn't on the world's oldest clotheshorse
list.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lambert, for people not up on such matters, is the
nonagenarian fashion press agent whose real achievement was to help
turn American designers into personalities. That was in the 1940s,
before anyone knew about Norman Norell, Bill Blass or the charisma
of the jet set, when designers were kept hidden in back rooms, and
if fashion editors went to Seventh Avenue at all, they were greeted
by stiff-armed manufacturers in fireproof suits.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lambert, the daughter of a circus promoter from
Crawfordsville, Ind., changed that. She started the twice-a-year
fashion shows and the Coty Awards gala, which took place at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art and was the forerunner of the Costume
Institute's annual silk-purse party.
</P>
<P>
   She was in the right place at the right time, namely, at the
dazzling intersection of fashion and society in the early 1960s.
And she was able to exploit her position chiefly because she
controlled one of the most flagrantly superficial promotional
devices ever conceived: the International Best-Dressed List. ``It's
a trivial thing,'' said Miss Lambert lightly of her list.
</P>
<P>
   But, oh, Jackie, Gloria, Babe _ was there ever a list that so
gloriously affirmed the status quo while creating excitement for a
new style of life? There were people who would have killed to be
considered BDL, and, Miss Lambert said, some tried to use their
influence, even money to get on the list. It was that big a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was terribly proud of myself,'' recalled Nan Kempner, the
Park Avenue socialite, who got on the list several times in the
mid-1960s, along with Gloria Vanderbilt, Mica Ertegun, Chessy
Rayner, Amanda Burden, and Marisa Berenson. ``In that time, it
mattered a great deal. It was a kudos.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lambert is a little vague about the origins of the list,
stating in one account that it was founded by French designers in
1924 and in another that it was the brainchild of a New York Times
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Her confusion has nothing to do with her age. She has always
been vague about the details, a trait common to shrewd, old-time
press agents. As Marylin Bender said of Miss Lambert in ``The
Beautiful People'' (1967): ``Her accomplishments are all the more
impressive because they arise out of seemingly total confusion. She
is chronically tardy and affects a vague, helplessly feminine
manner at times, but always manages to pull her chestnuts out of
the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the Best-Dressed List is a remarkable social record,
specifically of New York. In most years, the list reflects a frank
preference for women of classic style and pedigree, to say nothing
of means.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is something innately conservative about the
whole setup,'' said Amy Fine Collins, a Vanity Fair writer, who
made the list for two years before being bumped up to the Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're out to pasture,'' admitted Ms. Vanderbilt, a Hall of
Famer.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Mrs. Kempner described this permanent status, ``The Hall
of the Forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   In another sense, however, the Best-Dressed List seems absurdly
quaint when all the rules (hem lines, proportions, the right shoes)
have been thrown out. ``I think it's great that Miss Lambert has
kept the traditions up,'' said Andre Leon Talley, a Vogue editor
and frequent committee member. ``But the list doesn't reflect the
social or cultural Zeitgeist as much as it should.'' The group has
tried in recent years to be more populist, citing the influence of
stars like Madonna and Nicole Kidman.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But apparently, open-mindedness has its limits. When William
Norwich, the columnist and House &AMP; Garden writer, proposed both the
Prince of Wales and Prince the performer several years back, Jerome
Zipkin, the late social arbiter, rose up, pointed a finger, and, as
Norwich recalled, roared, ``Don't you ever say those two names in
the same breath here again!''
</P>
<P>
   (``Zippy was Zippy,'' a longtime committee member conceded. ``It
was always a good thing if he liked you.'')
</P>
<P>
   But then, the committee has never professed to be broadly
informed except where aristocrats and jet setters are concerned.
``Last year, I nominated Maxwell, the singer,'' Talley said, ``and
a few people in the group said, `Oh, is that the heir to the
Maxwell coffee fortune?'''
</P>
<P>
   Like other designers with new ideas, John Bartlett treats his
recent inclusion on the list (men have had their own category since
1966) with bemused surprise, but said, ``The people who'd be on my
list would be thrown out.'' He mentioned the actor Alan Cummings,
the designer Jil Sander, and a London corset maker named Pearl.
``He's so bizarre looking,'' Bartlett said approvingly. ``He's like
watching a train wreck. You just can't take your eyes off him.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, no, that wouldn't have gone over with Miss Lambert's
committee members last week. Not that they wouldn't have had an
opinion about a man in a corset. It's just that they seemed to have
an agenda, and as the name of each nominee was bandied about the
room, they quickly reached a consensus, and then another was thrown
into the ring, carved up (but gently) until they had a list.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the choices seemed to spring full blown from newspapers
that very month: Kenneth I. Chenault, the new chief executive of
American Express, and Tony Duquette, the flamboyant set designer
and decorator who's been having a big comeback. Others simply came
from the Upper East Side. It was 1965 all over again, except with
loose hair.
</P>
<P>
   On the women's list: Aerin Lauder, Brooke Douglass de Ocampo,
Eliza Reed, Patricia Herrera, and Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece,
all part of the so-called junior social crowd; Victoire de
Castellane, a Paris fashion muse; Serena Linley, a daughter-in-law
of Princess Margaret; Marian McEvoy, editor of Elle Decor; Jade
Jagger, a daughter of Mick Jagger, and the actresses Uma Thurman,
Cameron Diaz and Gwyneth Paltrow, who almost didn't get on.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the committee thought that anyone who'd wear a
dress to the Oscars that fitted as poorly as Ms. Paltrow's didn't
belong on the list.
</P>
<P>
   The other male winners were Prince Pierre d'Arenberg, Count
Ruffredo Gaetani, an Italian businessman; Phillips Hathaway of
Sotheby's; Lord Hindlip of Christie's; Thomas Kempner, the banker;
Prince Michael of Kent, John F. Kennedy Jr., the rock singer Lenny
Kravitz, and the actors Rupert Everett and Dylan McDermott.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lambert's list makers were under the impression that their
identities and comments would remain anonymous, so they spoke
freely in her apartment. But on Friday, Women's Wear Daily
published the names of the committee, which included Reinaldo
Herrera, a Vanity Fair editor who is married to the designer
Carolina Herrera; the jewelry designer Kenneth Jay Lane, Norwich,
and several Conde Nast contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the trade paper called them ``a motley group,'' and
said that Herrera and Lane got into a spat.
</P>
<P>
   One detected the hand of Miss Lambert in the brouhaha, although
she denied that she had released the names, as the paper reported.
As for the drama between Lane and Herrera, Lane had joked that
Herrera had used his influence to put his daughter Carolina Jr. on
the Best-Dressed List.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera objected. Lane offered him an apology and a cigarette.
``It wasn't a big deal at all,'' Herrera said.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that the list is an anachronism, but said that
doesn't mean it is irrelevant. He explained:
</P>
<P>
   ``When you walk down the streets of New York today, it seems as
if the whistle has blown for the factory, and the factory workers
are let out. Everybody looks the same. No originality, no
individuality.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PEC, Yugoslavia _ Silvia Buzshila, just 16, sat huddled and
shivering on the ground by the bus station in this Kosovo city,
surrounded by her family and about 35 other Albanians _ surrounded
but utterly lost.
</P>
<P>
   Threatened by Serbs and bombed by NATO again Monday for the
second time in four days, presumably by NATO, Miss Buzshila had
absolutely no idea where to find safety, or even a bed for the
night in Pec. In a city of 70,000 before the Serbian rampage began,
looted Albanian shops now gape emptily and the smoke from burning
Albanian houses still rises thickly in the air, already heavy with
rage and fear.
</P>
<P>
   A drive here from Belgrade, Serbia's capital, revealed an eerie,
other-worldly place, full of blood and blood oaths, of houses
licked by flame and others painted with Serbian slogans and symbols
to protect them from the fiery fate of Albanian properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid of the bombing. I'm afraid of everything,'' Miss
Buzshila said. ``Where are we supposed to go?''
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Djemail, 56, did not understand his daughter's
English, but he heard her tone, and he began to sob.
</P>
<P>
   Only 18 miles from here, the Yugoslav government said, a NATO
warplane rocketed and strafed a bus and some cars at a police
checkpoint Monday, high in the soul-stirring mountains that lead to
Montenegro. NATO spokesmen said they had no information about such
an attack.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials who accompanied reporters to the scene Monday
said that at least 17 people were killed and 40 wounded. The scene
was horrific in the increasingly familiar way in which frail human
bodies are ripped apart by explosive blast and steel.
</P>
<P>
   A bureaucratic paper giving Zoran Mihajlovic the right to get
gasoline for his white Ford Sierra, plate DJ 173-70, from April 29
to May 3 to secure food for his restaurant, lay soaked in his blood
by his car. His Ford was holed with shrapnel, its glass burst, its
white paint burned away.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard enough for reporters who arrived after the event.
They noted the smear of blood by the woman's black-strapped shoe;
the two blasted civilian cars and two police cars; the buzzing
flies; the scraps of flesh; the unexploded cluster bombs; the
meager belongings in the rice-bag suitcases of the refugees and
travelers, still crammed into the shattered bus, its faded blue
polyester curtains ragged from broken glass and shrapnel.
</P>
<P>
   But Miss Buzshila and her family were there when it happened
Monday, at about 2 p.m., in a second bus behind the first, trying
to flee to Montenegro. Asked what she saw, she cupped her hands to
her face, covering her eyes and twisting her head violently away.
</P>
<P>
   The Buzshila family is from Prizren, the lovely old Turkish town
deep in southern Kosovo where ethnic groups had lived peacefully
together. Four days ago, while the Serbs intensified their
expulsions of Albanians from Prizren and NATO intensified its air
campaign, a bomb fell on a house just behind theirs, and the
Buzshilas decided to flee.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the Serbs so much, she said in English _ unprompted
and untranslated _ that set the family to flight. It was the bomb
that made life in Kosovo seem impossible. That she should have been
where a bomb fell again Monday seemed so utterly implausible that
even she could not take it in.
</P>
<P>
   NATO denies that its bombs cause anyone to flee, but that is a
dubious notion to anyone who has had one land nearby, when it feels
as if one's head is coming off and one's stomach is so clenched it
strains a muscle.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs deny that there is any organized effort to expel
Albanians from Kosovo. That is an even more ludicrous notion to
anyone who has seen the hundreds of shelled and burned houses, the
empty villages in the Kosovo countryside, the wandering farm
animals, the starving horses and wild packs of dogs, the empty
cities and echoing streets, the looted stores and ruined mosques,
with Christian crosses spray-painted on them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As Miss Buzshila spoke, a young Serbian man with a short beard
rushed up, also speaking English. ``Don't listen to these Albanian
lies!'' he shouted. ``We've done nothing to these people!'' He
spat. ``You all write lies! Did you see that bus? That's a real
crime! You go and just write more lies while we go home and wait
for the bombs _ and for what? For nothing!''
</P>
<P>
   Others gathered and began to push and shout.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Buzshila retreated, cowering into her father and the other
Albanians, who pressed themselves against a low stone wall, waiting
for a bus to anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   All over Pec, houses and shops stand burned or labeled. Many are
marked with the Serbian symbol, a cross with a Cyrillic ``C'' _ the
Latin ``S'' _ in each quadrant. Some have the word ``Serbia''
spray-painted on, or display the Serbian flag. One house was marked
``JUL'' on its windows, the abbreviation for the Yugoslav United
Left party of President Slobodan Milosevic's wife, Mirjana
Markovic.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those spared had the Serbian cross and the word Romi, in
both Latin and Cyrillic, to indicate the owner is a Gypsy, or the
words, Romska Kuca _ Gypsy house.
</P>
<P>
   Decaying bodies of animals line the sides of the roads, dead
from starvation or lack of care or the crazed speed at which people
drive, as if they can outrun the airplanes or somehow cheat the
bomb aimed for the bridge. That also applies to the the buses, many
of which do contain policemen or soldiers. But some contain
ordinary people terrified for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   On the road from Pristina to Pec, a huge crater suddenly
appeared Monday, still smoking and seeming to cause the reddish
clay-like earth to bubble up. But there was already the beginnings
of a muddy, dirt-path detour through the empty, burned-out villages
where cows wander and chew on wood, and others lie bloated and dead
in courtyards, unburned and unburied, left for the maggots and
flies.
</P>
<P>
   At one such place, in a tiny Albanian village where the road
runs narrowly between woven branch hedge rows, there was suddenly a
checkpoint and a roadblock, and a single soldier, surprised by the
traffic, barring the way.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps what lay down that road was just another deployment of
soldiers living in small groups in abandoned houses, ready to try
to hold the ground if NATO troops should come. Or perhaps it was
another crater making even this path impassible.
</P>
<P>
   But the smell of corruption there was overwhelming. Perhaps what
was down that road was the kind of atrocity that the refugees
assert, NATO decries and the Serbs deny. Under Yugoslav army
escort, dangerous enough these days in Kosovo, it was impossible to
do other than to turn around.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a large, three-story house of white brick, set with
charm by a brook, was burning brightly, the flames cracking the
window glass and pale grey smoke moving up through the red-orange
roof tiles.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping for a moment to watch the collapse of a grandiose set
of dreams, the army escort said: ``Don't assume. I think it is just
one disappointed soul, who shut the door and said goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   But from the high switchbacks that mark the road between Pec and
Podgorica, one could see miles into the green valley that spread
out below. There were at least 10 billowing pillars of new smoke,
and hundreds of houses already burned, and the big cracking sounds
of NATO planes launching new attacks from the clear spring air, far
above the human wretchedness of Kosovo.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton signaled Monday a broad
willingness to deal with Belgrade over the terms under which NATO
air strikes against Yugoslavia might end, saying he would support
``a bombing pause,'' under ``the right circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   In a retreat, Clinton softened his position on the composition
of an international peacekeeping force for the embattled Yugoslav
province of Kosovo. He dropped his earlier insistence on NATO
leadership of such a body and instead said the alliance must be ``a
big part of'' any peacekeeping contingent.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official later tried to downplay the
remarks, telling reporters there was no meaningful shift in U.S.
demands for a peacekeeping force commanded and controlled by NATO.
Clinton made clear, though, that he was not wedded to any specific
formulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's discussion, room for discussion, within
limits, about who's in this force and all of that,'' said Clinton,
who is scheduled to leave Tuesday to visit NATO headquarters in
Brussels and to speak to U.S. troops in Germany that are
participating in Operation Allied Force.
</P>
<P>
   With extraordinary specificity and candor, Clinton detailed his
inner anxieties over continuing an escalating bombing campaign that
has presented growing risks even as it takes a mounting toll on
Serb military targets and fielded forces.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three days, two NATO aircraft have crashed, a third
took heavy anti-aircraft fire and a fourth dropped a bomb that
destroyed a civilian bus, killing, according to state-run media in
Yugoslavia, 47 people. Yugoslav media reported that NATO strikes
destroyed a second bus Monday, killing at least 20. NATO officials
had no confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not relish every night sending young Americans and our
NATO allies up in planes flying very fast under very hazardous
circumstances in which their safety is at risk,'' Clinton said
during a White House press conference. ``I do not relish the
thought that inevitably some of those bombs will go astray and some
Serbian civilians, or some Kosovar civilians, could be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   And, said Clinton, ``I do not relish the continuing burdens on
the people of Albania and Macedonia,'' a reference to the estimated
700,000 ethnic Albanian refugees that have poured across those tiny
countries' borders from neighboring Kosovo. ``I am eager to get the
Kosovars out of the camps and on their way back home and
rebuilding.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks, made during a joint news conference with
visiting Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, kicked off what's
expected to be a week of intensive diplomacy. Clinton left the
press conference to meet with Russia's envoy to the Balkans, Victor
Chernomyrdin, to discuss possible ways to end the conflict with
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin emerged from the 90-minute meeting to tell
reporters that U.S.-Russian differences were narrowing, but no
breakthrough was in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got closer to a diplomatic solution,'' Chernomyrdin said.
``It's a very complicated issue. We'll keep on working.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official who later briefed reporters on
background, however, was less optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   He shot down any prospect of a near-term solution, saying ``I
expect this discussion with the Russians, with our allies, will
continue over some days,'' and, perhaps, ``some weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, his Russian interlocutors
and the United States remain far apart on the issue of how to
constitute a post-settlement security force in Kosovo. Milosevic
wants civilian monitors under United Nations command.
</P>
<P>
   The United States insists that Kosovar refugees will not return
to their homes without the protection of heavily-armed military
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin -- who sent Clinton a letter via
Chernomyrdin outlining Moscow's position -- has agreed on the need
for some sort of military peacekeeping force, but has not yet
accepted a NATO presence in such a force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian government continues to share our basic
objectives,'' said State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin. ``Now we
have to find an implementation mechanism to achieve those
objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the Chernomyrdin meeting, Clinton met with the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, who secured the weekend release of three American
soldiers from Milosevic and, in exchange, called for a halt in
NATO's air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's attacks continued unabated, however, with U.S. and allied
pilots hitting 45 targets across Yugoslavia between Sunday morning
and early Monday, in one of the most furious 24-hour periods since
the campaign began March 24. The strikes were expected to escalate
further overnight Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read NATO's response as the idolatry of might,'' Jackson
told ABC News. ``I read it, in some sense, as the arrogance of
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said Jackson's focus on the U.S. prisoners' release didn't
reflect the purpose of the NATO strikes: to combat Serb atrocities
that U.S. and NATO officials estimate have left at least 4,000
ethnic Albanians dead and have driven 1.5 million more to flee
their homes in Kosovo over the past six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think more attention should be focused on the brutal war
crimes,'' continuing to unfold inside Kosovo, said Rubin. ``Jesse
Jackson was not able to go to Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic gave Jackson a letter to Clinton, which the White
House received on Sunday. The letter, though, ''has nothing new in
it,'' said the senior White House official.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted that NATO's essential demands have not changed.
The alliance will continue its bombing campaign, Clinton said,
until Milosevic ends the military campaign targeting the majority
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and agrees to allow refugees to return
to their homes and enjoy political autonomy under the protection of
an international security force.
</P>
<P>
   When NATO began bombing Yugoslavia nearly six weeks ago, the
White House specified a NATO peacekeeping force as one prerequisite
for ending the attacks. The administration later said such a force
must be ``NATO-led.'' Two weeks ago, the administration stepped
back slightly from that position, saying the force must simply have
``NATO at its core,'' a formulation that Rubin stuck to Monday
during his daily press briefing.
</P>
<P>
   During repeated references to the force, however, Clinton
himself pointedly dropped even the more ambiguous ``core,''
reference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, what I said is subject to negotiation is, who is going to
be in the security force, how is it going to work and all of
that,'' Clinton said, responding to a reporter's question. ``Except
I do believe that the NATO group has to be a big part of it
because, otherwise, the Albanians, the Kosovar Albanians, won't
want to go back. And neither will the armed groups among the
Albanians readily lay down their arms.''
</P>
<P>
   A compromise over the make-up of such a peacekeeping force could
set the stage, Clinton suggested, for a broader diplomatic solution
to the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said that under the right circumstances, we would be
willing to have a bombing pause,'' Clinton said. ``But we would
need acceptance of the basic principles and at least the beginning
of withdrawal of Serb forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Until such a solution is reached, Clinton said, the bombing
campaign would continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not trying to drag this out,'' said Clinton. ``But I am
determined to pursue our policy until we know that we have a chance
to do what has to be done in order for this to work as a practical
matter, and in order finally, to, clearly and unambiguously,
reverse the policy of ethnic and religious cleansing.''

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton signaled Monday a broad
willingness to deal with Belgrade over the terms under which NATO
air strikes against Yugoslavia might end, saying he would support
``a bombing pause,'' under ``the right circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   In a retreat, Clinton softened his position on the composition
of an international peacekeeping force for the embattled Yugoslav
province of Kosovo. He dropped his earlier insistence on NATO
leadership of such a body and instead said the alliance must be ``a
big part of'' any peacekeeping contingent.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official later tried to downplay the
remarks, telling reporters there was no meaningful shift in U.S.
demands for a peacekeeping force commanded and controlled by NATO.
Clinton made clear, though, that he was not wedded to any specific
formulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's discussion, room for discussion, within
limits, about who's in this force and all of that,'' said Clinton,

HYPOTHESIS: THE ARTIST DOES SEE THINGS DIFFERENTLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., U.K.)  (lh) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Can artistic talent be measured scientifically? A
laughable notion, perhaps. And yet, according to ``The Painter's
Eye,'' an intriguing small show at the National Portrait Gallery in
London that runs through June 13, some of the secrets of the
creative process are now being cracked by the latest biomedical
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition is built around a recent study of the interaction
between an artist's eyes, hand and brain while he draws a face. By
measuring his controlled or unconscious responses on three
different machines and by comparing the results with the reactions
of nonartists, researchers believe they have already proved that
the artist's mind is indeed different.
</P>
<P>
   The study was carried out by John Tchalenko, a British scientist
and a documentary filmmaker, along with teams of cognitive and
neuropsychologists and neurophysiologists from Britain and the
United States. The chosen artist was an English figurative painter,
Humphrey Ocean, four of whose works are in the National Portrait
Gallery's collection.
</P>
<P>
   The project was born somewhat accidentally of an earlier purely
artistic experiment in which Tchalenko and Ocean, an old friend,
decided to record each other at work. For 100 hours Tchalenko and
his camerawoman, Belinda Parsons, filmed Ocean while he painted
them. The painting, ``Double Portrait,'' and the film were then
shown side by side in several leading British galleries in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years after that, I was looking again at the tapes,
which were time-coded, and I began to pick up Humphrey's eye
pattern movements,'' recalled Tchalenko, 61, whose own scientific
background is in seismology, the study of earthquakes. ``This was
interesting in that it showed how a painting is produced, not
merely seen,'' he added. ``When I contacted the specialists, I was
surprised to discover how little was known about how artists
actually work.''
</P>
<P>
   Backed by a $30,000 grant from the Wellcome Trust, a large
medical research charity, Tchalenko then turned for help to
scientists from Oxford University's physiology department. They
used a special ``eye tracker'' camera to follow Ocean's eye
movements and a sensor that recorded his hand movements. For
comparison purposes, nonartists were tested in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the section ``The Eye Captures,'' the exhibition
shows how the camera follows Ocean's eyes as he selects a portrait
model from among four young men. Photographs of each man carry red
markings that indicate how the artist explores the special features
of each face, starting with the eyes and working through a rapid
series of short fixations, with as many as 140 fixations per
minute.
</P>
<P>
   When he begins sketching, however, Ocean's rhythm changes. As he
looks at the model, he focuses on a very specific place, which may
represent a single pencil line. He also glances from the paper to
the model about 12 times per minute, each fixation lasting about
one second. Thus, of the five hours that he spent completing the
drawing, one hour was spent looking at the model. In contrast,
nonartists look at the model in a far less methodical way.
</P>
<P>
   For the section ``The Hand Implements,'' where a movement sensor
measured the artist's hand in conjunction with the eye, Ocean was
given just 12 minutes to sketch a face, ``Luke 2.'' The exhibition
displays the finished drawing as well as another computer drawing
that shows every movement of his hand, on and off the paper. This
serves to confirm how Ocean frequently and repeatedly practices
each line just off the paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all my work, I'm after precision and I think detail is
precision,'' Ocean explained. ``Detail means where the line lands,
and if it lands a millimeter to the right or a millimeter to the
left, it changes the weight, in some way, or the shape that it is
describing. So when that line lands, you want it to land in the
right position, whatever that is.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the Oxford University experiments were able to
quantify eye-hand coordination, it is the brain that links the eye
and the hand. And for the section ``The Brain Processes,''
Tchalenko and Ocean traveled to Stanford University in California,
where the artist's brain was scanned through a functional magnetic
resonance imaging technique. Specifically, while lying in the
scanner, he was given small sketchbooks and was asked to copy six
photographs of faces and six abstract shapes.
</P>
<P>
   It was here that the study came up with its most revelatory
results. The ``seeing'' process for everyone takes place in the
visual cortex at the back of the brain, which receives nerve
signals representing light captured in the retina. At the same
time, increased blood flows are evidence of increased brain
activity. In this exhibition, thanks to photographs of scanned
``slices'' of different brains, it is possible to see that, when
drawing a face, nonartists in the experiment used only the back of
the brain, while Ocean used mainly the frontal part of his brain.
And this, apparently, is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Humphrey, the real transformation was taking place in the
front, where you find emotion, previous faces, painting experience,
intentions and so on,'' Tchalenko explained. ``In essence, the
control subjects were simply trying to copy what they saw. But
Humphrey was creating an abstracted representation of each
photograph. He was thinking the portraits.''
</P>
<P>
   Tchalenko emphasized that this study was very limited in its
scope since it involved only one artist drawing black-and-white
portraits. Next he would like to study a painter as he mixes and
chooses colors as well as an abstract artist who is painting from
his imagination and not from a model. But he said it was difficult
to raise money for such projects. ``Science bodies think this is
art, and art bodies think this is science,'' he said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he thinks the results obtained so far already have
practical uses for other professions where eye-hand coordination is
critical, like surgery and air traffic control. ``Keyhole surgery
involves the same input-output as painting,'' he said. ``I'm sure
we can get to the stage where we can identity a particular
surgeon's eye pattern. It would then be possible to measure if,
say, he is tired. I think what we have demonstrated is that the
science and technology is already in place.''

AN OPTOMETRIST AT BARNEY'S  
 SILVER-AND-GOLD DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A downtown optometrist, Selima Salaun, has taken up
residence at Barneys New York. So the store's hip customers can now
wear her prescription glasses with their Pradas, Yohjis, Manolos
and Kazukos.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salaun, who has optical stores in SoHo and the East Village
(plus a lingerie store called La Cosette and a trendy boutique
called Bond 07, both downtown), has installed Elena Rosen, one of
the optometrists on her staff, in a fourth-floor room at Barneys to
examine eyes by appointment and dispense prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The Selima collection of eyeglass frames, plus others by Martine
Sitbon, Francis Klein, Kyoto and Moda, is ensconced in a corner of
the hosiery department on the main floor. There are frames
appropriate for men and women and even some for children. So you
can get matching mother-daughter or father-son frames.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd been selling sunglasses,'' Judy Collinson, an executive
vice president of Barneys, said, ``and people were buying them to
put their own lenses in. So we thought we should add the extra
service. And we knew Selima was one of those fashion secrets that
Barneys customers would relate to.''
</P>
<P>
   Frames range from $150 to $450, and lenses from $90 to $400 (for
invisible grading). The lenses are ground in the SoHo store, so
delivery usually takes 48 hours, but longer for the graded ones. &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers strolling on Madison Avenue in the last few months
may have noticed a shop called Lagos and assumed it was another
Greek jeweler selling imported wares. The jewelry even has that
opulent Old World look. But the owner and designer, Steven Lagos,
41, is an American from Philadelphia who has a workshop and store
in his hometown and always dreamed of a store in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The dream came true last November on the corner of 67th Street,
at No. 794, where the selling space is tiny but the windows large
enough to showcase the jewelry inside. Most of the pieces are
silver trimmed with gold and adorned with pearls or semiprecious
stones; the average price is $1,000. The styles are more classic
than modern, with beading, fluting and grillwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lion's share of my business is in silver-and-gold
combinations,'' Lagos said on a recent visit. ``We sold 90,000
units in silver and gold last year.'' In addition to his own stores
(there's a third one in the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas), the Lagos
jewelry is sold at Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue and some
independent jewelers.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos said he started making jewelry in the early 1970s, while
he was still in high school. ``The craft movement was happening,''
he remembered, ``and I started making spoon jewelry. I had a van
and went around selling it at flea markets. I became fascinated by
the idea of making things. A lot of hand work goes into the jewelry
today. There are 75 craftsmen working in my studio.''
</P>
<P>
   Lagos progressed from spoons to repairing jewelry and then to
designing. The silver-and-gold collection evolved in the mid-1980s
for Neiman's, which wanted to develop a bridge jewelry collection,
something that was between costume and fine jewelry. His first
store in Philadelphia opened in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our customers are real-jewelry customers,'' he said.
``They buy Lagos for fun, for travel, because it isn't as costly as
the good stuff they buy from Cartier or Van Cleef &AMP; Arpels.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did recently add some 22-karat gold-and-platinum jewelry
with diamonds that goes for as much as $40,000.

MEDIA EXECS GIVE AMBIVALENT RESPONSE TO CLINTON'S CONFERENCE CALL

   Entertainment executives find themselves in an uncomfortable
position as a result of President Clinton's call for them to join
educators, religious leaders and others next Monday at a White
House conference on children and violence. While eager to show that
they are as concerned about the issue as anyone else, they are also
determined to avoid taking blame for incidents like the school
killings in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   From filmmakers to television producers to video game
manufacturers, most executives who were asked about the White House
conference excused themselves by saying they had not yet received
invitations.
</P>
<P>
   But they also hastened to point out that renditions of violence
differ drastically among various media _ movies, popular music,
music videos, computer games and television _ and even between
cable and broadcast television networks. More important, some said,
they want to make sure that media violence does not become a
scapegoat for children's wielding semiautomatic weapons and
building bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Several people who participated in a conference call with
presidential aides last Thursday to discuss the conference said the
White House was told by a number of industry representatives that
if the gathering was labeled as being about ``media and violence,''
the entertainment companies would refuse to take part.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest advocates of that position wanted to make sure the
gun manufacturing industry was included in the conference,
believing it far more culpable in adolescent violence. But some
entertainment executives said they did not want to be photographed
in the same room with gun manufacturers, believing this would imply
that the two industries had roughly equal culpability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never turned down an invitation from a president, and I'm
not going to start now,'' said Jack Valenti, the president of the
Motion Picture Association of America. ``But I did tell the White
House that if they wanted others to attend, just focusing on the
entertainment industry was the wrong way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   A a number of entertainment industry executives, although not
Valenti, are declining to testify Tuesday at a hearing on media
violence being held by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science
and Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software
Association, did not participate in the conference call last
Thursday, but he agrees that it is important to extend the focus
beyond entertainment companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important that it be a balanced and open
discussion, as opposed to a finger-pointing exercise,'' Lowenstein
said. ``If it's not an effort to scapegoat but an effort to look
broadly at the issues, I think people will participate.''
</P>
<P>
   The video game industry has been particularly faulted recently
because of violent simulated shooting games like Doom, which was a
favorite of Eric Harris, one of the Littleton killers. But
Lowenstein said that ``shooter games,'' as they are called,
accounted for only 6 percent of the $5.5 billion worth of computer
games sold last year and that the most frequent users of such games
were over 18 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they're rated and labeled for mature audiences,'' he said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton signaled Monday a broad
willingness to deal with Belgrade over the terms under which NATO
air strikes against Yugoslavia might end, saying he would support
``a bombing pause,'' under ``the right circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   In a retreat, Clinton softened his position on the composition
of an international peacekeeping force for the embattled Yugoslav
province of Kosovo. He dropped his earlier insistence on NATO
leadership of such a body and instead said the alliance must be ``a
big part of'' any peacekeeping contingent.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official later tried to downplay the
remarks, telling reporters there was no meaningful shift in U.S.
demands for a peacekeeping force commanded and controlled by NATO.
Clinton made clear, though, that he was not wedded to any specific
formulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's discussion, room for discussion, within
limits, about who's in this force and all of that,'' said Clinton,
who is scheduled to leave Tuesday to visit NATO headquarters in
Brussels and to speak to U.S. troops in Germany that are
participating in Operation Allied Force.
</P>
<P>
   With extraordinary specificity and candor, Clinton detailed his
inner anxieties over continuing an escalating bombing campaign that
has presented growing risks even as it takes a mounting toll on
Serb military targets and fielded forces.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three days, two NATO aircraft have crashed, a third
took heavy anti-aircraft fire and a fourth dropped a bomb that
destroyed a civilian bus, killing, according to state-run media in
Yugoslavia, 47 people. Yugoslav media reported that NATO strikes
destroyed a second bus Monday, killing at least 20. NATO officials
had no confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not relish every night sending young Americans and our
NATO allies up in planes flying very fast under very hazardous
circumstances in which their safety is at risk,'' Clinton said
during a White House press conference. ``I do not relish the
thought that inevitably some of those bombs will go astray and some
Serbian civilians, or some Kosovar civilians, could be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   And, said Clinton, ``I do not relish the continuing burdens on
the people of Albania and Macedonia,'' a reference to the estimated
700,000 ethnic Albanian refugees that have poured across those tiny
countries' borders from neighboring Kosovo. ``I am eager to get the
Kosovars out of the camps and on their way back home and
rebuilding.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks, made during a joint news conference with
visiting Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, kicked off what's
expected to be a week of intensive diplomacy. Clinton left the
press conference to meet with Russia's envoy to the Balkans, Victor
Chernomyrdin, to discuss possible ways to end the conflict with
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin emerged from the 90-minute meeting to tell
reporters that U.S.-Russian differences were narrowing, but no
breakthrough was in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got closer to a diplomatic solution,'' Chernomyrdin said.
``It's a very complicated issue. We'll keep on working.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official who later briefed reporters on
background, however, was less optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   He shot down any prospect of a near-term solution, saying ``I
expect this discussion with the Russians, with our allies, will
continue over some days,'' and, perhaps, ``some weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, his Russian interlocutors
and the United States remain far apart on the issue of how to
constitute a post-settlement security force in Kosovo. Milosevic
wants civilian monitors under United Nations command.
</P>
<P>
   The United States insists that Kosovar refugees will not return
to their homes without the protection of heavily-armed military
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin -- who sent Clinton a letter via
Chernomyrdin outlining Moscow's position -- has agreed on the need
for some sort of military peacekeeping force, but has not yet
accepted a NATO presence in such a force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian government continues to share our basic
objectives,'' said State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin. ``Now we
have to find an implementation mechanism to achieve those
objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the Chernomyrdin meeting, Clinton met with the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, who secured the weekend release of three American
soldiers from Milosevic and, in exchange, called for a halt in
NATO's air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's attacks continued unabated, however, with U.S. and allied
pilots hitting 45 targets across Yugoslavia between Sunday morning
and early Monday, in one of the most furious 24-hour periods since
the campaign began March 24. The strikes were expected to escalate
further overnight Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read NATO's response as the idolatry of might,'' Jackson
told ABC News. ``I read it, in some sense, as the arrogance of
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said Jackson's focus on the U.S. prisoners' release didn't
reflect the purpose of the NATO strikes: to combat Serb atrocities
that U.S. and NATO officials estimate have left at least 4,000
ethnic Albanians dead and have driven 1.5 million more to flee
their homes in Kosovo over the past six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think more attention should be focused on the brutal war
crimes,'' continuing to unfold inside Kosovo, said Rubin. ``Jesse
Jackson was not able to go to Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic gave Jackson a letter to Clinton, which the White
House received on Sunday. The letter, though, ''has nothing new in
it,'' said the senior White House official.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted that NATO's essential demands have not changed.
The alliance will continue its bombing campaign, Clinton said,
until Milosevic ends the military campaign targeting the majority
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and agrees to allow refugees to return
to their homes and enjoy political autonomy under the protection of
an international security force.
</P>
<P>
   When NATO began bombing Yugoslavia nearly six weeks ago, the
White House specified a NATO peacekeeping force as one prerequisite
for ending the attacks. The administration later said such a force
must be ``NATO-led.'' Two weeks ago, the administration stepped
back slightly from that position, saying the force must simply have
``NATO at its core,'' a formulation that Rubin stuck to Monday
during his daily press briefing.
</P>
<P>
   During repeated references to the force, however, Clinton
himself pointedly dropped even the more ambiguous ``core,''
reference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, what I said is subject to negotiation is, who is going to
be in the security force, how is it going to work and all of
that,'' Clinton said, responding to a reporter's question. ``Except
I do believe that the NATO group has to be a big part of it
because, otherwise, the Albanians, the Kosovar Albanians, won't
want to go back. And neither will the armed groups among the
Albanians readily lay down their arms.''
</P>
<P>
   A compromise over the make-up of such a peacekeeping force could
set the stage, Clinton suggested, for a broader diplomatic solution
to the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said that under the right circumstances, we would be
willing to have a bombing pause,'' Clinton said. ``But we would
need acceptance of the basic principles and at least the beginning
of withdrawal of Serb forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Until such a solution is reached, Clinton said, the bombing
campaign would continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not trying to drag this out,'' said Clinton. ``But I am
determined to pursue our policy until we know that we have a chance
to do what has to be done in order for this to work as a practical
matter, and in order finally, to, clearly and unambiguously,
reverse the policy of ethnic and religious cleansing.''

 &HT;    Summer could be 'major health problem' in Macedonian camps, Hall
warns
 &HT;    By By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After wandering through a mucky tent compound that
houses ethnic Albanians in Macedonia and Albania last weekend, a
group of House members returned to say they were awe-struck by the
scale of human suffering triggered by the Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
   And even as they expressed fear at the prospect of refugees
still living in tents when winter comes, they said they were
pleased by the optimism America's strained military still holds
about fulfilling its mission to drives Serb forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Tony Hall (D-Dayton, Ohio) was the ranking Democrat on
the trip led by Majority Leader Richard Armey of Texas, which
returned Sunday night after visiting one refugee camp, two air
bases and NATO headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, a veteran of refugee camp visits around the world, said
conditions at the crowded camp in Skopje, Macedonia, were bad but
orderly. He said the U.S. must plan to spend more for humanitarian
relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went because a million people are in misery,'' Hall said.
``A lot of people were talking about the winter, but they better
worry about the summer. It could be a major health problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said doctors at the site have begun seeing cases of
measles, and with seasonal temperatures rising, the camps could be
ideal places for waves of infectious disease such as cholera and
dysentery.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he'll offer an amendment to the $12.9 billion
emergency spending bill now working its way through Congress to
redirect some money so more is spent on immediate relief efforts.
In the bill, $195 million is budgeted directly for refugee
assistance, though additional money will go to border countries
such as Macedonia to help offset what they've spent so far.
</P>
<P>
   But Hall believes some economic assistance, such as the
rebuilding of infrastructure, can wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's important,'' Hall said, ``but compared to a million
refugees it's not important right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey, who last week voted against a resolution supporting the
air campaign, seemed moved by the sights and sounds and stories of
the 28,000 people in the refugee camp. He didn't specifically
endorse Hall's blunt assessment that the spending bill is
inadequate for humanitarian needs, but he understood the
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my understanding that we were fairly generous in the
(emergency spending bill) as it goes now for relief,'' Armey said.
``(But) I don't think anybody, any of us, could come away from
that, seeing that hardship, without feeling a sense that whatever
we're doing, we probably need to be doing more.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey also spoke most forcefully on the need ``to develop a
sense of urgency'' about the plight of these refugees if they're
still living in tents when winter returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why in the middle of a beautiful springtime it
hit me so hard, an awareness of what that winter would be like for
people,'' Armey said. ``I say it's imperative, I just don't think
they'll survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Hall and Armey, joined by others from both parties, were
uniformly impressed with the morale of the U.S. military people
they met during their base visits. Armey said everyone he met
sensed some frustration over the political limits imposed on which
targets they can attack, but no one complained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonetheless there was a broad sense of conviction, belief,
commitment to completing the objectives of this air war,'' Armey
said. ``And I sensed nobody that felt an incapability of doing
that, and the subsequent need for ground troops for the completion
of this.''

EXXON TRIES TO GET $5 BILLION VALDEZ SPILL PENALTY SET ASIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Exxon Corp. mounted a multipronged legal offensive
here Monday, urging the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to set
aside the record $5 billion award to fishermen and others damaged
by the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill.
</P>
<P>
   While saying Exxon ``deeply regrets'' the spill that fouled a
400-mile-long stretch of Alaska beaches, the company's attorney,
John Daum, argued that there are limits to the deep pockets of the
world's largest oil company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The $3.5 billion in expenses Exxon incurred is clearly enough
to deter anybody from anything,'' argued Daum, a partner in the Los
Angeles law of O'Melveny and Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon has fought for five years the punitive damage award handed
down by an Alaskan jury. It has yet to pay anything to the
fishermen, business operators and Alaska natives who sued the oil
company. An estimated 40,000 people, some of them Seattle-based
fishermen, would potentially benefit from the award.
</P>
<P>
   But a three-member panel of federal appellate judges appeared
receptive to some of the company's appeals during Monday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The company claimed that it already has paid out $2.2 billion in
cleanup costs, more than $1 billion in civil settlements and
criminal fines, and dispersed $300 million to fishermen and fish
processors.
</P>
<P>
   Brian O'Neill, a Minneapolis lawyer who argued the plaintiffs'
case to the Anchorage jury, defended the jury's verdict before the
appeals court panel.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill said the decision of jurors, who heard more than three
months' testimony on America's worst environmental disaster,
``should be treated with great deference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting a drinking alcoholic in charge of a supertanker is
inherently reckless conduct,'' O'Neill argued.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to Capt. Joseph Hazelwood, who was drinking in
the hours before the Exxon Valdez departed the oilport of Valdez
and went off course to avoid floating ice. Hazelwood was in his
cabin and an inexperienced third officer was on the bridge when the
tanker hit Bligh Reef and discharged 11 million gallons of crude
oil into Alaska's pristine Prince William Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Punitive damages are designed to punish reckless behavior and,
by their severity, to deter future calamities that can cause
widespread harm.
</P>
<P>
   In the polite but cut-and-thrust environment of the federal
courtroom, a major issue argued was whether Exxon behaved
``recklessly'' _ as the jury found in awarding punitive damages _
or was guilty of the lesser offense of negligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exxon stipulated (in the trial) that Captain Hazelwood was
negligent in leaving the bridge,'' Daum said. ``We did not
stipulate anything to do with recklessness.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys were closely questioned by the two Republican
appointees on the appellate panel.
</P>
<P>
   The most skepticism of the plaintiffs' case was voiced by Judge
Charles Wiggins. A former California congressman, Wiggins gained
brief national attention 25 years ago as President Richard Nixon's
chief defender in House Judiciary Committee impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins peppered O'Neill with questions about whether
Hazelwood's drinking was a direct cause of the accident. If
recklessness can't be established, Exxon doesn't owe ``a damned
cent'' in punitive damages, he remarked.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Wiggins jokingly asked whether the Exxon Valdez
was better off, given the captain's drinking, in not having
Hazelwood on the bridge. An uncomfortable O'Neill was left to argue
that a drunken Hazelwood would have performed better on the bridge
than his inexperienced third mate, Gregory Cousins.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the judges' questions, Exxon effectively raised issues
before the appellate panel.
</P>
<P>
   Daum seemed to strike a chord with Wiggins in arguing that the
$5 billion judgment was excessive, in his words, ``200 times the
highest award ever upheld by an appellate court.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is dominated by the overwhelming settlement,''
Wiggins later told O'Neill. ``That assumes liability. I am not sure
you have identified liability.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Andrew Kleinfeld of Fairbanks, an appointee of President
Bush, asked meticulous questions of both sides. But he appeared to
respond to Exxon's argument that a $5 billion settlement is not
necessary to deter future accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they break a tanker on rocks, they lose $25 million worth
of oil, plus the break in the tanker, plus they have $2 billion in
cleanup expenses: Why is that not enough to make them more
careful?'' asked Kleinfeld.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill replied that all the risks and potential spill costs did
not stop Exxon from running tankers captained by alcoholics, with
tired and overworked crews.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime judge appointed to the 9th Circuit by President
Kennedy in 1961, Judge James Browning kept his counsel over the
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel also heard arguments over the so-called
``Seattle Seven,'' a consortium of seven Seattle seafood processors
who made a backdoor deal with Exxon at the onset of the damage
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Seven were paid $70 million in damages. They
remained plaintiffs, however, and secretly agreed to hand over to
Exxon their share of the final damage award in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Russell Holland, who presided at the
trial in Alaska, later decried the agreement, which was not
disclosed to the court or jury, as ``pernicious'' and ``an
astonishing ruse.'' He refused to let the seafood processors
participate in any punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   But Daum argued Monday that the deal should be reinstated. It
was good not only for the seafood processors and Exxon, but ``good
for society'' and ``good for the courts,'' he said. ``Public policy
favors settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Exxon lawyer added that such pre-trial agreements are
usually not disclosed. Kleinfeld disagreed. ``In my experience,
they're usually disclosed in discovery,'' he said, referring to the
evidence gathering that goes on before a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon also called for a new trial based on the arguement that
one of the Anchorage jurors was harassed into agreeing to the
amount of punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was the conduct of a bailiff who, during deliberations,
pulled his pistol out of its holster, held out a bullet, and
suggested to a juror that the jury member holding out against
punitive damages ``be put out of her misery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In any criminal case, in any ordinary civil case, a new trial
would have been granted without question,'' Daum argued. He said
the incident threatens ``the integrity of the jury process in
general.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kleinfeld noted that the bailiff's ``stupid comment'' was
taken as a joke by the juror to which it was made. The holdout
juror never learned of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did anyone actually believe he was going to kill the juror?''
asked Kleinfeld.
</P>
<P>
   The judge noted that the bailiff was caught, fired and later
died of a heart attack. ``That ought to be a deterrent,'' he told
Daum.
</P>
<P>
   The Exxon damages trial lasted through the summer of 1984, and
was followed by 23 days of deliberation in which the jury decided
on damages. ``When trials get really long, crazy things happen,''
said Kleinfeld.

 &HT;    $3 million settlement expected in fraud suit
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Football star turned foreign currency trader
Russell Erxleben agreed Monday to settle a civil lawsuit filed by
10 investors who claim Erxleben defrauded them of $1 million
through his now-defunct foreign currency trading company.
</P>
<P>
   If the settlement is approved today by District Court Judge Paul
Davis, a judgment of $3 million could be entered against the former
star kicker for the University of Texas Longhorns, attorneys said
Monday. The $3 million figure would include actual and punitive
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the plaintiffs can collect on the judgment remains to be
seen. Erxleben's lawyers say he doesn't have any of the money taken
in by his trading company, Austin Forex International.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Forex closed its doors Sept. 11 after taking in $50
million from about 800 investors.
</P>
<P>
   The suit by the investors is one of several filed against
Erxleben and Austin Forex in the wake of the company's collapse. It
was the first case to go to trial.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal regulators also have been investigating the
company and Erxleben for fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Erxleben has denied any wrongdoing, attributing the lost
millions to trading losses.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's settlement offer was made by Erxleben's lawyer, John
Stratton. Robert Goldsmith, attorney for the plaintiffs, told the
judge that the lawyers would either present a written settlement
agreement to the court this morning or resume the trial, in which
Erxleben is accused of fraud, breach of fiduciary trust and
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $50 million invested in Erxleben's company, less than
$400,000 in cash remains, testified Janet Mortenson, the
court-appointed receiver to Austin Forex.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Forex was in business for about one year, and it
attracted large and small investors. The company pooled investors'
money and proposed to make foreign currency investments with them.
</P>
<P>
   But Mortenson estimated that $17 million coming from later
investors was used to repay early investors. Austin Forex,
Mortenson said, was a fraudulent ``Ponzi scheme'' in which early
investors were repaid with money from later investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appeared to me that Austin Forex had no sources of money
other than investors' money,'' Mortenson said, ``so any funds paid
to investors came from other investors.''
</P>
<P>
   The receiver said Erxleben was uncooperative in helping her sort
out what happened to all the money.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Orr, one of Erxleben's lawyers, said his client doesn't
have any of the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Erxleben lost the money in trading,'' Orr said in an
interview. ``He did not put money in his pocket. He does not have a
hidden fund of cash. He just made a lot of bad trades and lost the
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Erxleben appeared in court at the start of the trial but left
soon after. He would have been required to take the stand and
testify later in the case, Davis ruled Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we will reach an agreement,'' said John Gilmore,
one of the investors. ``Otherwise, we will resume the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The other plaintiffs in the case are Wayne McMichael, James
Foster, Louis Hill, Karen Dougherty, Gennelle Rutland, Katherine
Holcomb, Billy Holcomb, William Beck and Francis Reissig.

 &HT;    Bush is reported willing to call tax cuts session
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, who's delayed a final
decision about running for president until the legislative session
ends, is willing to call a special session to get approval for $2
billion in tax cuts, several lawmakers told the Austin
American-Statesman Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Holding two fingers less than an inch apart, one lawmaker said,
``We're this close to a special session.''
</P>
<P>
   Another lawmaker said the governor has said, ``My front porch
strategy is working well enough that I may as well stay here for
the summer.'' The lawmaker couldn't say whether Bush was making a
threat or a simple comment.
</P>
<P>
   None of the sources wanted to be identified because of ongoing
discussions, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Though not officially a candidate, Bush is an early front-runner
for president.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush has declared that he won't leave Texas to campaign
during the legislative session, which ends May 31. A special
session presumably could delay Bush's campaigning even longer.
</P>
<P>
   The early polls, however, aren't all good news for the governor.
In one, few Texans could name any Bush accomplishments as governor.
In a New Hampshire poll, Bush's popularity fell when the names of
potential candidates were replaced with biographical descriptions.
Those findings could mean Bush needs to score a major victory this
session.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the governor has indicated a willingness to call a
special session, Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said, ``Not that I
am aware of.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor believes we have ample time to enact significant
tax cuts and education reform between now and May 31,'' McClellan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas governors can call special sessions for up to 30 days and
can set the agenda. An agenda regarding education spending or tax
cuts, however, would be broad topics under which lawmakers could
consider a host of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has already approved a bill that supporters say cuts
property taxes by $1 billion. The bill also would raise the minimum
teacher salary schedule by $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Rep. Paul Sadler, D-Henderson, has questioned the
level of tax cuts in the Senate bill. Sadler, chairman of the House
Public Education Committee, has offered an alternative with $500
million in property tax cuts and more than $3 billion for teachers'
pay and increased school spending. The issue is expected to be
debated in the education committee this week.
</P>
<P>
   Other tax cuts, including some for businesses and some for
consumers, have passed the Senate and are likely to start being
considered by the full House next week.
</P>
<P>
   Along with other issues, Bush put tax cuts and teachers'
compensation at the top of his agenda this year. He originally
called for $2 billion in property tax cuts, $307 million in
business tax cuts and $330 million in sales tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's proposed state budget has room for about $1.5
billion in overall tax cuts and the House's version of the state
budget has room for $3 billion in new education spending and tax
cuts and another $700 million available for other things, like
sales and business tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   According to one of the sources, Bush now wants $2 billion in
total tax cuts. Told that he could get $1.5 billion, the governor
said he was willing to wait for $2 billion, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the sources took Bush's comments as threats or a line in
the sand. Instead, they said Bush appeared to be making clear that
his potential presidential bid could wait beyond May 31. One source
said Bush's comments were made in a joking manner. But another
disagreed, saying Bush appeared serious, but not threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers said if Bush talked about a special session,
it was likely just an opening to negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he has a press conference and says here's what we get or
else there's a special session, then there's a line in the dirt,''
said lobbyist Chuck McDonald, who was an aide to former Gov. Ann
Richards. She went through three special sessions, including the
last one in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said he doubts the governor is seriously considering a
special session because he can claim victory now. And Democrats,
McDonald said, should be wary of trying to push Bush into a special
session where he could be hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not accurate to say Democrats don't have anything to
lose,'' he said. ``They could lose all the concessions they've
gotten up to now.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in the Senate forced changes resulting in more money
for teachers and less for property tax cuts before the bill was
sent to the House. They also broadened business tax cut proposals
to help inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   Another source, who asked not to be named, said a special
session has potential benefits and drawbacks for the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plus side is that he's a man of principle fighting for
what he believes in,'' the source said. ``If he gets (the tax cuts
he wants) or close, it shows strong leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``The downside is that it indicates he's having a tussle _ a
fight _ with the Legislature. It could delay or slow down his
(presidential) campaign effort. And, if he gets a third or a half
of what he wants, why wasn't that good enough in May.''

 &HT;    Questions face K-State offense after heavy turnover
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A year ago, with mercurial quarterback Michael
Bishop running and passing, the Kansas State Wildcats led the
nation in scoring.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, the Wildcats, short eight starters from a unit that
averaged 48.0 points a game, are producing something else with
near-equal proficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   While the defense is plugging in three new starters and expects
to be at least as strong as last year's unit, which ranked in the
NCAA Division I-A's top 10 in all four major statistical
categories, the offense enters the fall with question marks at
several key positions.
</P>
<P>
   _Quarterback. Bishop had a hand in 37 of the Wildcats' 65
offensive touchdowns, and his big-play potential either by running
or passing (12 TD passes of at least 25 yards). Jonathan Beasley, a
junior who redshirted last year after lettering in 1996 and '97, is
probably a slightly better passer than Bishop but not as explosive
of a runner. He was unable to seize the job in the spring because
of a hand injury, but neither Adam Helm or sophomore Jeremy Milne
was able to make a run at the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to get better,'' said Coach Bill Snyder. ``I think
they haven't expressed a consistency that you would like to have.
There are certain things about their games that just need time and
effort and focus on their part.''
</P>
<P>
   _Offensive line. Only two starters _ center Randall Cummins and
left tackle Milford Stephenson _ are back, and a third player who
had six starts at right tackle, Thomas Barnett, left the team in
the spring and may not return. Cummins missed nearly all of the
spring with a leg injury and Stephenson replaced him, but
Stephenson will likely be a utility linemen in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches like what they've seen from left tackle Chris
Bailes, a redshirt freshman, but starting defensive tackle Damien
McIntosh, a second-team all-conference pick last fall, worked on
offense in the spring and may switch positions.
</P>
<P>
   _Running back. Starting halfback Eric Hickson is gone and will
be replaced by a pair of explosive backups. Frank Murphy, who
missed four games last year because he violated NCAA rules by
receiving a car from a booster, is back and promises big things. In
the spring game he carried 21 times for 89 yards but also fumbled,
something he did all too frequently a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who has great speed, also saw time at receiver in the
spring, but he concentrated on running back after projected
starting halfback David Allen, who returned four punts for scores
last season, was injured.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting addition is junior-college transfer Joe Hall, who
is 6-2, 265 pounds. He has said he wants a shot at halfback,
despite having the size that would seem to make him a better fit at
fullback.
</P>
<P>
   _Receiver. Aaron Lockett returns after making honorable-mention
All-Big 12 as a freshman and will be the go-to guy. Sophomore
Brandon Clark (6-3, 220) and junior-college transfer Quincy Morgan
(6-2, 205), who redshirted last season after playing a year with
Bishop at Blinn College, are both big targets who can run.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton held an extended discussion
Monday with the Russian special envoy for the Balkans, but the
White House remained pessimistic about the prospect of a deal
anytime soon to end the conflict in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials expressed gratitude for Russian efforts to
broker a peace, but said the bombardment of Yugoslavia would
continue unabated until President Slobodan Milosevic bends to
allied demands.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian envoy, for 90
minutes at the White House late Monday afternoon, and then briefly
with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who secured the freedom last weekend
of three American servicemen held in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin said after his meeting with the president that he
had brought a plan from Moscow and Belgrade for ending the Balkan
conflict, but did not provide details. He said that he and Clinton
had discussed the terms under which NATO would halt its air attacks
on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got closer to a diplomatic solution,'' Chernomyrdin said.
However, he added, ``This process requires a very detailed
negotiation, discussion. There can be no uncertainty because the
stakes are very high.''
</P>
<P>
   But American officials said that Milosevic appeared no closer to
accepting allied terms for ending the fighting despite six hours of
talks with Chernomyrdin last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect these discussions will continue for days and weeks,''
Samuel R. Berger, the White House national security adviser, said
at a briefing Monday evening. ``It won't result in some magical
breakthrough in the next nanosecond.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the Russians were useful as an intermediary between
NATO and Belgrade, a historical ally of Moscow. He said he believed
that ``the Russian position is closer to ours than Milosevic's
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin continued the talks into the late evening with Vice
President Al Gore and a small group of administration officials at
the vice president's residence. The two have worked together on
U.S.-Russian relations since 1993 and have spoken frequently on the
crisis in the Balkans since the allied air campaign began on March
24.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference on Monday afternoon before his meetings
with Chernomyrdin and Jackson, the president brushed aside calls
for a pause in the bombing in response to the release of the
soldiers and other apparent overtures in recent days by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said there would be no allied halt in hostilities until
the Serbian ethnic and religious cleansing of Kosovo ceases and the
1.5 million ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo are allowed to
return in safety.
</P>
<P>
   But the president also seemed to provide at least a small
opening for progress on the diplomatic front, saying that he would
consider a bombing pause ``if it's clear that it will be in aid of
that larger purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's plenty to talk about,'' Clinton said of the Russian
initiative to bring an end to the Balkan conflict.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the composition of a post-war peacekeeping force
was open to negotiation. Last week, Milosevic said in an interview
that he would accept a lightly armed foreign presence in Kosovo,
staffed by non-NATO countries like Russia. While NATO has set out
conditions that would include an armed force with NATO at its core,
Clinton said Monday that such a force could include non-NATO
members including Russia, Ukraine, even Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Administration aides said that political arrangements for Kosovo
could be discussed with Belgrade once the shooting stops.
</P>
<P>
   The president also offered a somewhat softer formulation of
other conditions NATO is demanding as the price for ending the
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that the bombing of Yugoslavia could end if there
were ``clear and unambiguous evidence that a withdrawal is
underway,'' a more moderate variation on previous demands for
withdrawal of all Serbian army and police forces from the province
of Kosovo on a ``precise and rapid timetable.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger, the national security adviser, said that Clinton did not
intend to signal any change in NATO conditions for ending the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a new position,'' Berger said. ``That answer has
been given 50 times.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was attempting to navigate a narrow passage between
resolve on allied war aims and flexibility on terms for ending the
conflict, as calls for a negotiated ceasefire grow and divisions on
the war deepen in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Before meeting with the president, Jackson said, ``We must seize
this moment to take the step to dramatic diplomacy from bloody,
protracted war.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kofi Annan, the secretary-general of the United Nations, said in
New York Monday night after returning from Europe that there was no
immediate prospect of peace in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he welcomed the release of the American prisoners,
but warned, ``We still have a lot of work to do on the political
and the diplomatic front before I can say that we are on the verge
of a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan met late last week with German and Russian leaders,
including Chernomyrdin, but returned to New York with no concrete
proposals for ending the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything,'' he said, ``the trip to Moscow and Berlin has
reconfirmed my belief that we should do whatever we can to find a
political solution because the implications of the alternative are
too frightening to contemplate.''

   The success of Jackson's free-lance mission to Belgrade to win
freedom for the prisoners, along with a 213-213 vote in the House
on a resolution in support of the allied air campaign last week,
have noticeably changed the climate in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Monday deferred action on a bipartisan resolution
calling on the president to use ground forces, if necessary, to win
the war in the Balkans. The resolution appeared doomed by
opposition from Senate leaders, who appeared more eager for a
negotiated settlement than victory on the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's conduct of the campaign has been questioned from the
beginning. But now that six weeks of bombing have failed to reverse
the wretched exodus from Kosovo, the calls for a quick diplomatic
deal to end the bloodshed are increasing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton welcomed the release of the American prisoners, who were
undergoing medical testing at an American military hospital in
Germany on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But the president said that their release alone was not
sufficient to end the allied air attacks. The two things are
``completely separate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we are very thankful for their release, let me be clear
why the military operations must continue,'' Clinton said. ``Three
Americans are home. Their families, their friends and the American
people, whom they have served faithfully, must be grateful. But
nearly one and a half million Kosovars are not home. When will
these people see their homes again, with the safety and rights Mr.
Milosevic has often pledged, but never delivered?''

</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted he was not seeking ``total victory'' over
Serbia and said he was conducting the war reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not relish every night sending young Americans and our
NATO allies up in planes flying very fast under very hazardous
circumstances in which their safety is at risk,'' the president
said. ``I do not relish the continuing burdens on the people of
Albania and Macedonia. I am eager to get the Kosovars out of the
camps and on their way back home and rebuilding. I do not relish
the thought that inevitably some of those bombs will go astray and
some Serbian civilians, or some Kosovar civilians, could be
killed.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``I am not trying to drag this out. But I am
determined to pursue our policy until we know that we have a chance
to do what has to be done in order for this to work as a practical
matter, and in order finally, to, clearly and unambiguously,
reverse the policy of ethnic and religious cleansing.''

COLOMBIA GOVERNMENT AND REBELS EXPAND PEACE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia _ After more than six months of
on-again, off-again discussions, the government and the main
left-wing guerrilla group announced early Monday that they had
agreed not only to begin formal peace negotiations aimed at ending
35 years of conflict, but also to invite international observers to
sit in on the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was made after a dramatic and unexpected six-hour
encounter here on Sunday between President Andres Pastrana and
Manuel Marulanda Velez, the top leader of the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, known by its Spanish initials as FARC. The
meeting was the first between a sitting Colombian president and a
FARC leader since the Marxist rebels launched their insurgency in
1964.
</P>
<P>
   At an informal 1 a.m. news conference at a tavern here in this
guerrilla redoubt, with a heavily armed guerrilla commander sitting
across from him, the chief negotiator for the government read a
seven-point joint statement indicating that the two sides had made
what he called ``a 100 percent advance'' toward an agenda for
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Not all issues had been resolved, the negotiator, Victor G.
Ricardo, said, but ``little remains,'' and formal talks will begin
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana won a decisive victory at the polls last year after
having promised to make a peace settlement his top priority. But
the dialogue with the rebels got off to a rocky start when
Marulanda failed to attend the first session, in January. Then
relations were suspended altogether after the rebels demanded that
Pastrana take steps to curb right-wing paramilitary groups that the
government said were beyond its control.
</P>
<P>
   For three months, much criticism was directed at Pastrana, who
made a significant and unusual concession to the rebels last year
to draw them into the peace effort. He agreed to withdraw all army
and police forces from an area the size of Switzerland that
includes this bustling jungle town, effectively ceding sovereignty
over the region to the FARC without receiving concessions in
return.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions resumed on April 20, shortly after Pastrana had
ordered the forced retirement of two senior army generals who were
reported to have links to a paramilitary group. With the
guerrillas' facing a government ultimatum to agree to formal
negotiations or withdraw their forces from the demilitarized zone
by May 7, both sides were under pressure and eager to prevent a
resumption of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The government and the guerrillas also agreed to invite outside
``persons or countries'' to observe the negotiations and ``help
overcome any problem.'' The rebels had rejected all offers by
international bodies to mediate or even observe their dialogue with
the government, describing the conflict, in which 35,000 people
have died just in the last decade, as a purely internal war.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ricardo did not say so directly, the advance from
preliminary talks to formal negotiations implies that the
guerrillas will be allowed to remain in control of the
demilitarized zone here. Asked about that, Ricardo said, ``The
president will take an appropriate decision'' in order to insure
that ``the peace process has an adequate space'' to progress.

<P>
   TOKYO _ It all started with a broken contract.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Nintendo backed out of an agreement to
include Sony CD-ROM technology in the next generation of its video
game machines.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Corp.'s chairman, Norio Ohga, a notoriously grouchy
business titan, apparently regarded the change of heart as an
affront to his company. So against much internal opposition, Ohga
decided Sony itself would go into the video game business and give
Nintendo Co., then maker of the world's most popular game machine,
a run for its money.
</P>
<P>
   But there was more to it than revenge. Ohga also needed a way to
retain one of his brightest engineers, Ken Kutaragi, who had sworn
to leave if Sony refused to pursue his dreams of making a game
machine unlike anything on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, more than 50 million Playstations have been sold
worldwide, and Sony Computer Entertainment, the business Kutaragi
runs, now accounts for nearly 40 percent of Sony's operating
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sony has made an even bigger gamble on Playstation,
announcing a corporate overhaul in March that will put the next
version of the game machine at the heart of its reconfigured
empire.
</P>
<P>
   Nobuyuki Idei, Sony's president, sees the machine, or at least
the revolutionary chip at its core, as the first significant
challenge to the Wintel empire, the combination of Intel
microprocessors and Microsoft operating systems that are the heart
and soul of most personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   This has put Kutaragi, regarded at Sony as a bit of a wild card,
in the hot seat _ although he's not one to sweat. ``I don't feel
any different than I did before we made the announcement,'' he
said, perplexed by the suggestion that all this might raise his
stress level. ``We're just going to be forced to educate Sony Corp.
a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Idei is not at all fazed by such talk. ``Sony Computer
Entertainment will play a very important role in changing Sony's
future by encouraging the rest of the company to embrace change,''
he said. ``I don't see any danger that it won't harmonize inside
Sony.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Idei himself has described Kutaragi, 52, as ``a wild
horse,'' and already, the two seem to differ about how to handle
the incredible machine, now dubbed Playstation 2 but likely to be
renamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're going to do with this thing remains to be seen,''
said Koichiro Chiwata, an analyst at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   The tech world is buzzing with speculation. ``This machine has
the power of the highest-end computers masquerading as a game, an
amazing example of what one can do when one pushes the envelope to
its limits,'' said Elias Antoun, executive vice president of the
consumer product division of LSI Logic Corp., which makes the
central processor for the original Playstation and is making the
input-output processor for the new one. It could ``create
opportunities that no one can foresee.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kutaragi, uncharacteristically, seems less ambitious for his
machine, or at least less willing to reveal his extended vision.
``Having Playstation 2 become the core system for the home, that's
Idei-san's point of view,'' he said. ``But for now, we agree it's
going to be for games.''
</P>
<P>
   That's somewhat disingenuous, for Kutaragi is the first to lay
out the machine's ability to connect at high speed to the Internet
over cable and satellite links. He notes the slots it will have to
connect to modems and hard drives and its capacity to recognize
voices and even facial expressions.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities of interacting with simulations of everyone
from a cartoon character to, say, Leonardo DiCaprio, the actor and
heartthrob, are myriad. ``Imagine a virtual DiCaprio,'' Kutaragi
said. ``He'll be able to wink back at you and smile. He will even
be able to ask you how your day has been.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the level of Sony's investment, the Playstation 2 has to
be more than a game machine. Sony is spending $1 billion to $2
billion, Idei said, to produce the core chip and graphics chips
that make it so revolutionary, and many analysts doubt that it can
recoup that investment as a game machine alone.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Myers, a veteran technology analyst at Jardine Fleming
Securities in Tokyo, estimates that it will cost Sony at least $100
to produce each core chip, which Kutaragi has dubbed the Emotion
Engine for its ability to simulate real-time emotional responses in
its lifelike characters.
</P>
<P>
   Myers said Sony would have to charge at least $500 for a
Playstation 2 to even begin to approach break-even, making it at
least twice as expensive as rival consoles _ and some have
speculated the price will actually run to $700 or $800.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other analysts, Myers questions Sony's ability to
produce Emotion Engines as fast as it has anticipated. Sony has
said it will start selling Playstation 2 in Japan this winter.
</P>
<P>
   The chip is, indeed, a technical challenge. It will be built
using cutting-edge 0.18 micron technology, meaning the circuitry
wire is just 0.18 micron thick, not the 0.25 now typical. Sony has
linked up with Toshiba Corp., which has a strong reputation as a
chip maker, to make the Emotion Engine, but Toshiba has never
mass-produced a chip using 0.18 micron technology.
</P>
<P>
   It is also big and complex, which means there is greater room
for error and lower profitability. At 17 millimeters by 14.1
millimeters, the Emotion Engine will be the biggest chip ever
mass-produced. Chip makers say that for a typical consumer product
with sales in the millions, producing a chip bigger than 8
millimeters has usually been a recipe for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Kutaragi is well aware that his plans are audacious and that
skepticism abounds, but he's not concerned. ``The architecture is
different from that in current central processors, which are
typically designed for a system of calculation that was started in
the 1970s,'' he said. ``It's very aggressive and powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Emotion Engine was developed by a team of Sony and Toshiba
designers and engineers who saw the project through from the
earliest stages of research and development to final production. He
contrasted that with the infamous central processor in the Sega
Dreamcast game console, which was designed by Video Logic, a
British company, and then passed on to NEC for production.
Initially, NEC was able to produce only half the chips it promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``During research and development,'' Kutaragi said, ``there was
no collaboration between the designers and NEC.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said Aston Bridgman, an NEC spokesman. ``You can't make
a high-performance machine like Dreamcast,'' he said, ``without all
kinds of close cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony has also adopted the Intel model to churn out the Emotion
Engine. Intel has the same start-up problems that any chip maker
has, but because it typically dedicates one production line to one
chip only, it works out the kinks faster and can then produce mass
quantities with relatively few duds.
</P>
<P>
   Sony is paying some $500 million to retrofit Toshiba's Oita
plant, where the new chip will be made. Kutaragi said he expected
the factory to produce 10,000 chips a month initially and in five
years make enough chips for Sony to sell 20 million Playstation 2
machines a year. Sony is also spending $600 million to $700 million
to build a new chip plant in Nagasaki, which will have two lines
dedicated to making graphics chips for the Playstation 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not expecting the yields to be that high in the beginning,
certainly not to support demand in Japan, the U.S. and Europe,''
Kutaragi said. ``But it's very important for us to reduce the
number of defective chips and recoup our investment, and we think
we can easily do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Antoun, who previously ran LSI Logic's Japan business, has known
Kutaragi since the beginning of Sony's video game business and is
perhaps the foreigner who knows him best. While acknowledging that
the Emotion Engine will be hard to make, he said he had no doubts
that Kutaragi would live up to his promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has vision backed up with a strong understanding of what it
takes to get there,'' Antoun said. ``The basic assumption he's
using is simple: that technology is moving in his favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Kutaragi's confidence is based on Moore's Law, the bedrock rule
of microelectronics that says the density of transistors packed on
a chip will double every 18 months. In other words, even if Emotion
Engine is pushing the envelope now, technology will catch up
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   That belief has guided him throughout his career. In the
mid-1980s, he encountered the first ``chip'' that delivered
graphics in real time. Built by Sony for use in broadcasting, it
was 6 feet tall, 19 inches wide and 25 inches deep and housed
around 20,000 chips. ``I figured that in a decade, that box would
be a single chip,'' Kutaragi said.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, he bought a Nintendo 8-bit game machine
for his son and found himself fooling around with it. ``I realized
then that in the future, computers and computer science would
change our lifestyle, the way we played and lived,'' he said. He
was upset, however, by the machine's poor sound and pushed Sony to
negotiate a deal with Nintendo to use Sony sound components. That's
the deal that later fell apart, giving birth to Playstation.
</P>
<P>
   Sony had no desire to enter the game business, which was
dominated by Nintendo and Sega and relied on digital technology at
a time when Sony was devoted to analog. Games were toys, after all,
not serious business like TVs and Walkmans.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition discouraged Kutaragi. ``I was very sad,'' he
said. ``But I had a strong passion, so I decided to create my own
space to make my vision a reality, even if that meant leaving
Sony.'' But Sony agreed to set him up in his own company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Ohga-san when we set up Sony Computer Entertainment in
1993 that someday our business would become a big business and
influence our corporate betters in the same way that children
influence their parents,'' he said. ``It's natural, the way of
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Kutaragi's willingness to leave Sony, highly unusual in
risk-averse Japan, perhaps grew out of his family history. His
father, a native of Japan's southernmost island, Kyushu, returned
from World War II to nothing, moved to Tokyo and started a printing
company. It became quite successful, Kutaragi said, in large part
because the family did everything _ sales, printing, logistics,
accounting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't grow up in the typical salaryman's family,'' he said.
``It was more like growing up in a Jewish family and a Jewish
family business.'' When Kutaragi was 21, his father learned he had
cancer. Kutaragi had just finished engineering studies but got
ready to take over. ``It was interesting enough, it was profitable
and I had known it from when I was one year old,'' he said. ``But
my father told me he didn't want me to succeed him in the business,
he wanted me to be free.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 1975, the height of the first oil crisis in Japan, and
companies had all but stopped hiring. ``I wanted to work at Sony
and so I just went directly to human resources at the
headquarters,'' Kutaragi said. ``Someone at the top thought they
should probably hire a few very funny, unusual people.''
</P>
<P>
   He was one of 43 men and women Sony hired that year; the
previous year, he said, it had hired 660. ``I don't know why they
decided I was interesting,'' he said. ``I was just being myself.''

GROUP WARNS OF LIKELY RADIATION DANGER AT OLD BOMB FACTORIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Tenn., Md.) (nk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Energy Department, which has been raising money
for its costly environmental cleanup of old bomb factories by
leasing them to commercial tenants, may be exposing ordinary
factory workers to excessive radiation, an environmental group
says.
</P>
<P>
   At the site in Oak Ridge, Tenn., where the department once
processed uranium for nuclear weapons, manufacturers of machine
tools, cardboard boxes and other products pay reduced rent or
barter for space by cleaning up the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The department argues that the program saves tax dollars and
accelerates the cleanup of a 50-year legacy of bomb making. Robert
De Grasse, director of the office of worker and community
transition, said the department was trying to achieve the safety
levels set by the Environmental Protection Agency for re-use of
Superfund sites, a category that includes Oak Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in trying to protect workers that come on to our
sites,'' De Grasse said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, a
longtime critic of the Energy Department's environmental
stewardship, contends, however, that the department is inadequately
monitoring the workers' exposure to radiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to go down the road of creating a new generation
of exposed workers, without knowing whether they are members of the
general public, or radiation workers?'' said Arjun Makhijani,
president of the institute, which is based in Takoma Park, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Environmental Protection Agency say they are
also concerned about worker safety at the site, now called the East
Tennessee Technology Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is that we do not know if workers are at risk or
not,'' said John B. Blevins, an Oak Ridge Project Manager for the
environmental agency. ``There is not enough information that DOE
has provided to EPA to make a determination either way. In that
situation, we think it's not prudent to continue to lease until we
can insure that they're protected.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleanup work could be creating airborne contamination, Blevins
said, and some radiological and chemical hazards left from nuclear
operations may not have been cleaned up.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's report said that in one building, cleanup
workers in protective clothing were scraping concrete while
employees of tenants worked nearby in ordinary work clothes. The
building is mostly one giant room, with a 35-foot-high ceiling,
divided into sections by chain-link fences. Energy Department
officials say they monitor air conditions when cleaner workers chip
at concrete.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over worker safety dates from 1996, when leasing
started; about 23 companies now employ about 200 workers at the
site.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department has set an exposure limit for the workers
equal to exposure for workers in the bomb factory, or 5 rem per
year of radiation. That is about 13 times the amount of radiation
that the average American receives from all sources, natural and
man-made. The department says actual exposures are a tiny fraction
of that amount, but its limit is 200 times the level that the
Environmental Protection Agency has established for nuclear
industries' exposure of members of the general public, 25 millirem
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Tenants at the Oak Ridge site say they are happy. Mike Walker,
president of Dienamic Tooling Systems, which employs 15 people in a
27,000-square-foot space, said of the Energy Department, ``any time
they have removed concrete, or done anything that has potential for
things to be moved in air, they always have air monitoring
systems.''
</P>
<P>
   The department gave his employees instruction in radiation and
held a long question-and-answer session, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Logixx Automation, Inc., another machine tool company, moved to
Oak Ridge to take advantage of surplus equipment, including gantry
cranes that can handle 31 tons, and space at $1 a square foot. B.J.
Lipari, the company's president, said radiation exposure was lower
at Oak Ridge than in the company's old location, in Golden, Colo.,
where natural background levels are higher.

TAB FOR GRADUATION GIFTS RUNS UP

<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Forget the personalized pen-and-pencil set _
this year's college graduates are hoping for trips, cars, computers
and, most of all, cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is the hot ticket right now,'' said Gil Sanchez, a
University of Florida political science student who graduated
Saturday. ``We're in a transitional period, between finding a job
and going to grad school, and we need emergency money to pay the
bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez plans to use most of his graduation money to take care
of his debts and buy a suit, then enjoy what's left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy percent to pay off bills, the other percent for fun
stuff _ that's kind of the graduate rationale,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marlen Kroll, an English major, will put his graduation money
toward a summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking a road trip to Toronto for two weeks, so I'm hoping
to get some money to finance that,'' he said. ``Some people want
the titles to their cars that their parents own, or for them to
take care of their credit card bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Josh Etzkin has his sights set on a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made it through five years of college without a computer,
which is pretty funny since I'm getting a degree in electrical and
computer engineering,'' he said. ``I just used my roommates or went
to the lab. But it would be really nice to have something that
would last me a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Etzkin said his friends are asking for equally practical gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are having their diploma framed, or getting a briefcase.
But I have one friend who I'm kind of jealous of who's getting a
trip to Europe _ that's pretty awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuan Tran, a zoology major, said he doesn't really need anything
for graduation, but his friends have bigger ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my friends are saying they want to get a car, but I
think they're just dreaming,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not so for Dave Daniels, an accounting major who hinted to his
parents that life as a pedestrian was getting kind of old.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got me an '88 Volvo,'' he said. ``It's a lot better than
my bike.''
</P>
<P>
   Food science and human nutrition major Leigh Ann Gordon and her
brother, a senior at the University of South Florida, are sharing
the same graduation gift _ a trip to Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both major nature buffs,'' she said. ``I was going to go
to Europe, but then my parents said they'd take us with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Anneliese Doyle, an English and women's studies major, is hoping

   ``I need some clothes I might look presentable in,'' she said.
Her boyfriend had a different idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's getting power tools from his father. I guess he figured
he's getting older now and he ought to have his own.''
</P>

   Zoology and women's studies major Marisa Roberts is also
stocking up on grown-up items, with an eye toward filling an empty
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting furniture from my dad. That's all I know about,''
she said. ``I guess the ideal would be a car _ everyone wants a new
car. Or a new home, or paying for a master's program.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way from the modest three-initial chrome pen, but
the Cross pen and pencil sets _ which sell for $80 for a boxed set
to $200 for a desk set in a marble stand _ are still popular with
graduation traditionalists, said Karen Robbins of Central Florida
Office Plus, an office supply store in Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just this week I've sold three or four sets,'' she said.

FAA CALLS FOR EXPANDING BLACK BOX CAPACITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. _ The Federal Aviation Administration is calling
for new ``black boxes'' on thousands of airplanes over the next
five and a half years, including replacing the standard 30-minute
cockpit voice recorders with models that capture two hours of
sound.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed changes, prompted by shortcomings made obvious by
the crash last September of Swissair 111, an MD-111 brought down by
a fire near Halifax, Nova Scotia, were announced Monday by Jane
Garvey, the agency administrator, near the start of a three-day
international symposium here on crash recorders. Experts here said
that every form of travel could be safer if advanced black boxes
were carried by planes and trains, which have some form of data
recording now, and trucks and even cars.
</P>
<P>
   The symposium was run by the National Transportation Safety
Board, which has been urgently seeking the changes. Ms. Garvey said
her agency would also accept another safety board recommendation,
that older Boeing 737s, which have what board officials repeatedly
referred to as ``primitive'' flight data recorders, be upgraded by
August 2000. The FAA had given the airlines until August 2001; now
it says that upgrades that record the function of the rudder must
be completed a year sooner.
</P>
<P>
   The board has been seeking better flight data recorders on the
737 since the crash of USAir 427, in September 1994, which took
more than four years to solve. But FAA officials had previously
said that an August 2000 deadline would require that planes be
grounded for the upgrade, because not enough time remained to fit
the work into existing maintenance schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garvey said Monday that the schedule was ``very
aggressive,'' but that it could be adhered to. She also promised
special consideration for the one airline that took extensive
action before any requirement was formulated: Southwest Airlines,
which flies only 737s, voluntarily upgraded its flight data
recorders.
</P>
<P>
   All commercial planes made after 2002 would have new recorders
entirely, under the recommendations endorsed by Ms. Garvey. Those
planes would have two, each a combination flight data recorder and
cockpit voice recorder, to improve the chance that at least one
would survive.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation would require an independent 10-minute power
supply to enable recording to continue even if a plane's electrical
system stopped working. That would mean the end of recorders that
use a tape loop, board officials say, in favor of those that record
sound digitally. These recorders use only about 10 watts of power,
compared with 30 or 40 watts for a tape recorder. Another advantage
is that the memory chips are more likely than tape to survive a
crash.
</P>
<P>
   After the crash of TWA 800, which exploded off Long Island in
1996, investigators said that another tenth of a second of time on
the voice recorder might have given them far more data about what
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recorders have proved their worth over the decades as probably
the single most effective investigative tool we have,'' said James
E. Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, who
credited black boxes with helping reduce the accident rate in
aviation to .0002 per million miles flown last year, which was
one-sixtieth the fatal accident rate in 1960.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Trains carry ``event recorders'' and some ships carry ``voyage
recorders,'' but, Hall pointed out, ``The one mode where recorders
have not yet had an impact is highway accident investigations,
where more than 90 percent of all the accident fatalities occur.''
</P>
<P>
   General Motors has equipped 30 million cars with such recorders,
and other manufacturers have also equipped some vehicles, but
investigators have not been given the tools to extract the data
after a crash. Car manufacturers use the recorders when
investigating crashes in which the air bag deployed.
</P>
<P>
   In aviation, the newest planes have recorders that can give
stunning results, safety experts said. Hall said that in 1996, the
crashes of two Boeing 757s in deep water, one near Peru and the
other near the Dominican Republic, were solved quickly, without the
need to recover much of the wreckage, because of their advanced
flight data recorders.

RUSHDIE ROCKS ON: HIS LATEST NOVEL HELPS PUT THE PAST BEHIND HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID KIPEN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ `The Ground Beneath Her Feet'' begins on the day
Salman Rushdie's old life ended, with a fictional earthquake on
Valentine's Day 1989 _ the same day the author learned that the
dying Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini had put out a contract on
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably, of everything in the book, the thing I was
most uncertain about, whether to use that date or not,'' Rushdie
says, discussing his latest novel with The Chronicle while in town
for the American Booksellers Association convention. ``And really,
right up to the book going to the printer, the publishers kept
saying, `Well, make up your mind.'
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end I left it in, partly because I thought, well, if
I'm starting a book about a cataclysm in someone's life, everyone
is going to make the association anyway. The other reason, the
reason I really left it in, was because I felt it would give the
date another meaning for me. Instead of just having this terrible,
dark anniversary, now it's also the date my novel begins. That's a
good enough reason for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, the bounty on Rushdie's head _ like the hair on
it _ appears to be all but gone.
</P>
<P>
   For a man regularly demonized in certain quarters over the
years, Rushdie looks strangely like an imp: forked beard,
mischievous smile, dark blazer over what looks like a gray Gap
T-shirt, and a pair of baggy pants _ well befitting one of
contemporary English literature's premier vaudevillians. Also a
pair of sunglasses, worn indoors and prompting the now-familiar
question about his safety in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that stuff is much easier now, and the only reason
there is any degree of security here'' _ he indicates the pleasant,
beefy gentleman just outside, and the limousine whose doors require
all one's weight just to push them closed _ ``is that I didn't want
the LAPD to start making a big number out of it. The main reason is
to pacify the local security forces so they don't overreact. But
it's all coming back to normal.''
</P>
<P>
   As for those other assassins, the critics, reviews of the new
book, currently No. 2 on The Chronicle Best-Sellers list, have been
wildly mixed. What's unusual is that many writers have praised or
pilloried it for the same reason: its massive erudition, the
tremendously wide _ some say scattershot _ range of its references
to culture high and low.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ground Beneath Her Feet'' is a love story about two
fictional musicians whose partnership spans almost the whole
history of rock 'n' roll, overdubbed with impassioned, funny
meditations on music, mythology, history, exile and a medley of
other themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an odd thing these days,'' Rushdie says, ``that writers
can be criticized for knowing things. I mean, to criticize someone
for ignorance is one thing, but to criticize someone for knowing
something is odd. I use whatever materials come to hand to create
as rich a world as I can create, just as, as a reader, those are
the books I like to inhabit.
</P>
<P>
   ``... The way I've always thought of it, at least for myself, is
if you build a big car, then put a big engine in it. The big engine
is always narrative. If you can begin to tell people a story that
involves them, interests them, moves them, you can do almost
anything else and they will let you.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as splicing rock lyrics into the rarefied confines of a
literary novel. One song in ``The Ground Beneath Her Feet'' will
appear on U2's next album, a prospect all the more pleasing to
Rushdie because, as he admits with a wink, ``I'm happy to say that
the lyricist owns half the song.''
</P>
<P>
   Invited to mix an imaginary party tape for his readers, Rushdie
quickly warms to the topic:
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no escaping Elvis,'' he begins. ``I love the lyric of
`All Shook Up.' It's very funny. `Itchy as a man on a fuzzy tree.'
It's a fantastic line. `My friends say I'm acting queer as a pup' _
these are very strange lines. I know it's there to rhyme with `up,'
but nevertheless. ... And I might choose `Tutti Frutti,' `He's So
Fine,' `Leader of the Pack.' Then there's the meat of when I was
really a teenager and in my early 20s: ``Good Vibrations.''
``Surfin' USA,'' ``Surfin' Safari,'' ``Little Old Lady From
Pasadena.'' I was just in Pasadena this morning, and I was
thinking, `Go granny, go granny, go granny go.'''
</P>
<P>
   The case could be made that Rushdie's ``Satanic Verses'' was a
novel about theater, his ``The Moor's Last Sigh'' a novel about
painting, and now, with ``The Ground Beneath Her Feet,'' he's
written about rock 'n' roll. The obvious question, for a writer so
besotted with film that ``The Satanic Verses'' ends with a
shameless steal from ``The Manchurian Candidate,'' is when we will
finally get Rushdie's Hollywood novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's only a matter of time,'' Rushdie allows, ``given
someone who is as keen on movies as me. As for the next book, I'm
suffering from an embarrassment of riches. I have an idea which is
a kind of futuristic thriller. I have an idea for a historical
story set in Renaissance Florence. History was my subject, and so
many people were there at the same time _ Botticelli, Machiavelli,
Savonarola. It's an amazing period. Then there's another voice in
my head which says that after a book as long and elaborate and
baroque as this, what would please me most would be to do something
very stripped down, very spare, very lean, and I have an idea for
that as well, which is what I suspect is what I'm actually going to
do.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (MORE) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd also like to be faster. I have sort of a feeling that I'm
52, and how much longer is there? If I spend four or five years
writing a book, how many more years have I got? Not enough. So
maybe that will speed me up _ urgency. The ticking of a clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Not bombs anymore, just clocks. Yes, Rushdie knows his days are
numbered _ but maybe, finally, God willing, no more than anyone's.
Does he ever think about what direction his life might have taken
if Khomeini had gone into the dry-cleaning business?
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the first things you are taught when studying history
is never ask the question `What if?' Because what happens is
already hard enough. I guess less people would know who I was, but
those people who knew would know my name for the right reasons. It
was a strange fate to become famous for the wrong reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I really have no idea what we'd be sitting here talking
about, if we'd be sitting here talking about anything, had it not
been for what happened. It's just one of the things that happened
in my life, and writers' lives aren't usually as interesting as
this. I hope my life gets less interesting from now on.''

SNYDER RISES, BELCHER FALLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The pounding of the Angels' Tim Belcher
continued Monday afternoon and the worst of it came from someone
who didn't even swing a bat.
</P>
<P>
   John Snyder, the winning pitcher in the Chicago White Sox's 8-1
rout of Belcher, used to belong to the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder, only 24 and a month into his first full major-league
season, is dominating American League hitters while the Angels
wonder why Belcher continues to get beaten up every time out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes a guy makes it look so easy,'' said Belcher, who
failed to get out of the fifth inning for the third consecutive
start. ``Then there is what I'm going through right now. If I had
an excuse, I wouldn't use it, but I don't. My fastball is short and
my control is lousy.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder (4-1) pitched his second major-league complete game and
now is 11-3 since joining the White Sox in the middle of last
season. Belcher (1-2) allowed five runs in the fifth inning,
including homers by Jeff Abbott and Magglio Ordonez. What made it
worse was that right fielder Tim Salmon left the game after four
innings after spraining his left wrist diving for a ball.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon's status is day-to-day as the Angels open a nine-game
road trip tonight in Detroit. Belcher will get at least another
start.
</P>
<P>
   It would be revisionist history to rip completely the July 27,
1995 trade that sent minor-leaguers Snyder and McKay Christensen to
the White Sox in exchange for left-hander Jim Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels were leading the American League West and Abbott, one
of the most popular players in team history, was among the AL top
10 in ERA. They wanted to put away the Seattle Mariners. Instead
the Angels collapsed, Abbott lost 18 games the next season and took
a year off.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of the young Snyder in the Angels rotation instead
of the aging-by-the-minute Belcher was on the minds of at least two
dozen in the crowd of the 31,995 at Edison Field. Snyder, a product
of Westlake High School, left that many tickets for family and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very exciting to be back here and have everyone
there,'' said Snyder, who needed just 107 pitches and two hours and
eight minutes to beat the Angels. ``But those are the kinds of
situations that used to scare me. This is great, but believe me,
I've taken my beatings.''
</P>
<P>
   Not with the White Sox. Snyder meditates before each start to
relax. He does the rest by staying ahead of hitters and changing
speeds. Snyder allowed four hits and did not walk a batter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did today does not surprise me; we knew we were giving
up some talent in that trade,'' Angels general manager Bavasi said.
``But we were in a pennant race and Abbott was still a top
pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   With a starting staff that had gone at least seven innings in
the four games since Belcher's last outing, the Angels are expected
to be in the AL West race all season. But Belcher's problems are
beginning to sound alarms.
</P>
<P>
   After he blew a 10-0 lead last Wednesday against Toronto,
Belcher had the support of manager Terry Collins, who was quick to
point out that the 37-year-old free-agent right-hander won 14 games
for last-place Kansas City a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Collins stressed that Belcher will make his next start,
Sunday in Boston, but his voice did not sound quite so confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll sit down during the week, look at tape and try to figure
this thing out,'' Collins said.

 &HT;    Cameron helps Reds regain winning feeling
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Mike Cameron, oh-for-Atlanta over the weekend and
oh-for-2 Monday night, picked a perfect time to end the
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron drove a bases-loaded single off the right field wall
with one out in the ninth inning, ending the game dramatically and
providing the Cincinnati Reds with a 4-3 victory over the Arizona
Diamondbacks in front of a comfortable gathering of 13,943 in
Cinergy Field.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Boone started it with a perfect first-pitch bunt for a hit
up the third base line and Pokey Reese bunted him to second.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks walked pinch-hitter Mark Sweeney intentionally,
then relief pitcher Darren Holmes walked pinch-hitter Hal Morris on
four pitches to load the bases for Cameron, who delivered on a
1-and-0 count.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Steve Parris, summoned from Triple-A Indianapolis
as a stand-in starter for demoted and punished Brett Tomko, gave
the Reds exactly what they asked _ 5 1/3 innings, three runs, five
hits, three walks and a strikeout, turning over a 3-3 tie to the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Dennys Reyes, Scott Sullivan and Scott Williamson strung zeros
across the board to keep the score in place until something could
be done to alleviate the situation, which Cameron obliged.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jack McKeon, searching frantically for a lineup with
some hits in it, shuffled the deck _ dropping Mike Cameron from the
leadoff spot to No. 2 and elevating Michael Tucker to leadoff, plus
dropping slump-shrouded Barry Larkin to No. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else am I going to do?'' McKeon said. ``I'm just changing
it up, mixing it up. I'm putting two speed guys on top with Sean
Casey (third) behind them for a left-right-left look. We'll do this
a day or so, see if it gets us going. . .see if we can put three or
four hits together.''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't put three or four hits together in the first inning
against Andy Benes, but Benes helped with a pair of walks and
Larkin produced from the No. 6 spot for three runs.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Mike Cameron walked, Casey singled and Vaughn
walked, filling the bases. Cameron scored while Eddie Taubensee
grounded to first and Larkin drove a two-run single up the middle
for two more.
</P>
<P>
   Parris walked pitcher Benes to start the third and it cost him a
run. Benes took third on Tony Womack's single and scored on Jay
Bell's sacrifice fly, a well-smote ball that center fielder Cameron
flagged with a lunging stretch after a long spring.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Stinnett was Arizona's catcher when the lineups were
circulated, but he was scratched with flu-like symptoms and
replaced by Damian Miller, who just happened to be 2 for 3 career
against Parris.
</P>
<P>
   Make it 4 for 5. Miller singled in the second, then tied the
game in the fourth with a two-run homer behind Steve Finley's
triple.
</P>
<P>
   When Parris issued a one-out walk in the sixth, his night was
done and McKeon used Reyes and Sullivan to finish the inning and
leave it 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds put up a mild threat against relief pitcher and former
Red Greg Swindell in the seventh when Pokey Reese singled and
pinch-hitter Mark Lewis bunted him to second. Pinch-hitter Jeffrey
Hammonds took a called third strike, Cameron popped foul to the
catcher, end of mild uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Mild Uprising II surfaced in the eighth when Casey led with a
single, but it, too, died ingloriously. Vaughn flied to right,
stranding his third runner of the night, Taubensee lobbed to left
and Larkin popped to center as the Reds traveled eight innings
without putting together back-to-back hits.

SPORTS COLUMN: CUBA GAME COULD OPEN SOME DOORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The orange and black banners were hanging, giving a
festive feel to a soggy day.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Welcomes Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   This was not New York or Cleveland coming in for a big game.
This was the national team of Cuba. Salsa music danced out of the
Camden Yards loudspeakers, turning the arcade and the old brick
factory behind right field into a Latin plaza.
</P>
<P>
   When they hang out the bunting for the World Series, they don't
mention the opponent. It's just generic decoration. This was
different. This was one of the grand old baseball cities _ Wee
Willie, the Babe, Earl, Frank and Brooks _ playing host to a
baseball nation.
</P>
<P>
   Good manners were in order, just as they were in Havana in
March. The first game was an 11-inning thriller, won by the
Orioles, 3-2, and they were hoping for the same Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we all will win,'' said Omar Linares, the superb
Cuban third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   But who really wins from this strange little sequence? You could
almost hear the baseball scouts salivating over the talent that
Cuba saw fit to load onto the plane. They would love to pick off a
few, to slip a few business cards into a few willing palms, but
what does that prove? Is there some bigger picture here?
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Welcomes Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-Americans with memories of their homeland may fear that a
baseball relationship would only strengthen Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to say that a mere game or two cannot balance out
four decades of political repression in Cuba, economic sanctions
that the United States has imposed on Cuba, mutual bad blood.
</P>
<P>
   But there they were, big-timers with more than a bit of swagger,
in their glittering blue jackets, white pants and bright red ball
caps, playing in Camden Yards, a trifle more solemn than visitors
for a World Series, but ballplayers nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   At times, it sounded just like any other big sporting event,
with American sportswriters asking Alfonso Urquiola, the roly-poly
Cuban manager, why he had omitted this player or that player from
the road squad.
</P>
<P>
   Just the words ``Los Hermanos Hernandez _ the Hernandez
Brothers'' conjure up the specter of defection, but Urquiola
sounded like every other touchy manager when he said, ``I thought I
already explained that.'' Still, it was more than a game, it was a
gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Welcomes Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   There is something to be said for gestures _ the nod, the smile,
the word, the phrase that just might lead to something better.
There is something to be said for gestures like Preacher Jackson
going into Serbia and bringing back three captured American
soldiers, making sure they are safe at home, and then letting the
politicians argue about who is using whom.
</P>
<P>
   What is the endgame for this little home-and-home gesture? Why
would Fidel Castro even permit the American professionals to play
his state-supported amateurs? What could be worth the intense
security, the fears of defection, even the possibility of
ignominious defeat? What's in it for Fidel?
</P>
<P>
   Here they were, the cream of the international baseball circuit,
big-timers who play teams from Russia, Japan, Mexico, the Dominican
Republic, Australia. This summer they will go to Winnipeg for the
Pan American Games. These guys get around.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Welcomes Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   If they were flabbergasted by the amenities of a chain hotel
alongside the glitzy renovated harbor, they were not about to let
on. Did they glance at the varieties and the prices of a
room-service menu? On the other hand, did they catch a glimpse of
America's poverty outside their bus window? They were not saying,
but they did not shy away from the impulses of their baseball
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are changes taking place,'' said Luis Ulacia, an
outfielder with a firm jaw and an appraising glance. ``We do not
rule out that Cuban players will play professionally some day. It
all depends on change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish not to be forced to defect,'' Ulacia said, talking
about joining the majors some day. ``It would be a beautiful
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would play for free, just to prove himself, Ulacia
brought up the U.S. sanctions. ``Because of the blockade, I believe
it would be difficult. If they gave us the opportunity to play, I
believe the Treasury Department would not let us get paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Ulacia was making propaganda. There is plenty of that between
the countries. What is needed is the next step _ a series in
November, maybe, or a few Cuban players allowed to earn salaries in
the majors. There is something to be said for gestures.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Welcomes Cuba.

U.S. FREES ASSETS OF SUSPECT IN EMBASSY TERROR BOMBINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Treasury Department on Monday unblocked more
than $24 million in bank accounts held by Salih Idris, the Saudi
owner of a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan that American cruise
missiles destroyed last August after the terror bombings at
American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months ago the government blocked Idris' assets, after
intelligence reports linked Idris to Osama bin Laden, the Islamic
militant leader who authorities believed inspired the Africa
bombings, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Idris' lawyers, who had sued the government to unblock the
accounts, said that Monday's action was a tacit acknowledgment that
the investigation into the Africa bombings had failed to
substantiate that Idris was connected to the bin Laden terrorist
network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's order, lifting all restrictions on the Bank of America
accounts, also effectively removes any suggestion that Idris has,
at any time, maintained a relationship with Osama bin Laden or any
terrorist group or organization,'' said a statement by Idris'
lawyers, Mark MacDougall and Steven Ross.
</P>
<P>
   They said that the Treasury action strengthened their assertion
in an expected lawsuit against the government that the United
States mistakenly targeted the pharmaceutical factory. The United
States attacked the Al Shifa plant in Khartoum and a suspected
terrorist training camp near Khost, Afghanistan, on Aug. 20 in an
effort to curb the activities of bin Laden, a Saudi exile, after
the bombings of the two American embassies in East Africa. Bin
Laden has denied any role in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Idris, who was born in the Sudan, said he was pleased with the
decision. ``I am grateful,'' he said in a statement, ``that the
United States has taken the honorable course and has corrected, in
part, the serious harm that has been done to my family and our good
name.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was no formal apology from the Treasury Department,
which provided no explanation of why it unblocked Idris' assets and
has not officially announced any change in the American view of
Idris' ties to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The government's justification for attacking the Sudanese plant
remains a matter of dispute, although American officials have stood
by their assertions that soil samples obtained clandestinely from
the site tested positive for traces of Empta, a chemical used in
the production of VX nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have acknowledged that they did not know that
Idris owned the plant at the time, but other American officials
said that afterward they collected strong evidence linking him to
bin Laden.

   NEW YORK _ The Dow Jones industrial average's charge above
11,000 on Monday was led by formerly stodgy stocks sensitive to the
business cycle while money moved out of technology shares,
continuing a trend that has been in place for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial giants like Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing and
General Motors received a lift from a report from the nation's
purchasing managers indicating that the economy was growing with
little pressure for higher interest rates and that export markets
were reviving.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a whole new team of horses that are leading this
thing,'' said Ralph Acampora, head of technical analysis at
Prudential Securities. ``Five weeks ago, when the market first
closed above 10,000, the leadership was different. Money rushing
into a whole new set of stocks has lifted off a whole new bull
market.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow, which first closed above 10,000 on March 29, gained
225.65 points on Monday, to 11,014.69. So far this year, it is up
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which hit a record last
week but trails the Dow's performance this year, gained 19.45
points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,354.63. More than 400 stocks in the
index rose, while 82 fell.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for many investors, among the S&AMP;P 500's losers
were stocks like Microsoft, America Online and EMC, three issues
that have been standard-bearers for the entire market. Microsoft
fell 1 7/16, to 79 7/8; America Online slumped 9 5/8, to 133 1/8,
and EMC dropped 1 15/16, to 107.
</P>
<P>
   Selling in technology was not confined to those issues. The
Nasdaq composite index fell 7.27 points, or three-tenths of a
percent, to 2,535.58. And the Internet stock index compiled by
Thestreet.com slumped 23.29 points, or 3.6 percent, to 632.97.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet decline was led by Amazon.com, which tumbled 21
1/8, to 150 15/16, and Yahoo, which fell 12 1/8, to 162 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Cyclical stocks had another excellent day, and the Dow Jones
transportation average hit a record. The Morgan Stanley index of 30
cyclical stocks jumped 15.88 points, to 612.62, a new high. And the
transportation average climbed 49.3 points, or 1.35 percent, to
3,696.59.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 30 stocks in the Dow industrials, roughly half are
cyclicals, companies with fortunes closely tied to changes in the
domestic and global economic cycle. Among them, Minnesota Mining
and General Motors led the index higher. 3M gained 4 7/8, to 93
7/8, and GM rose 4 11/16, to 93 3/4. Goodyear Tire and Rubber, one
of the Dow's worst performers last year, gained 3 9/16, to 60 3/4.

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO broadened the scope of its air strikes
on Monday and attacked Yugoslavia's electrical system, crossing a
threshold in the 40-day campaign in a bombing that had an immediate
and widespread effect on the Yugoslav people.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said the aim of the attacks, which plunged
Belgrade into darkness Monday for several hours, was to disrupt
military communications, command centers and air defense systems.
Special bombs containing strands of carbon were used to
short-circuit transformers without destroying them.
</P>
<P>
   NATO planes have attacked bridges, oil refineries and other
targets in raids that have affected civilians. But until Monday
they had refrained from striking the electrical system. The
alliance has repeatedly insisted its fight is with President
Slobodan Milosevic, not with the Yugoslav people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that lights went out across 70 percent of the country
shows that NATO has its finger on the light switch now,'' said NATO
spokesman Jamie Shea. ``We can turn the power off whenever we need
to and whenever we want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a flurry of diplomacy Monday, NATO says it needs to
maintain the military pressure on Milosevic to withdraw his forces
from Kosovo and accept the demands of the allies.
</P>
<P>
   Having deferred serious consideration of using ground troops,
the alliance is relying on bombing attacks as its main source of
leverage on Milosevic. And in recent days the allies have expanded
both the range and intensity of the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to attacking the electricity network, NATO warplanes
are flying more low-level bombing raids against Yugoslav forces in
Kosovo, a tactic that until now had been ruled out as too
dangerous, Pentagon officials said Monday. The lower-altitude runs,
coupled with strikes against a wider array of targets, a spell of
clearer weather and a stepped-up Yugoslav defense, has greatly
increased the risk to allied pilots. Over the weekend three NATO
fighter-bombers were hit by ground fire. One of them crashed, but
the pilot was rescued.
</P>
<P>
   Though NATO insisted that its attacks on the electrical system
would frustrate the Yugoslav and Serbian military, it was not
immediately clear whether the forces had been hampered. The allies
also say the attacks will not cut power to hospitals and other
vital civilian services because they can turn to back-up generators
powered by diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Milosevic may soon face a choice: whether to use limited
fuel supplies for civilian generators or devote that fuel to the
military.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize the inconvenience that may be caused to the
Yugoslav people, but it up to Milosevic to decide how he wants to
use his remaining energy resources: on his tanks or on his
people,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO sought to downplay the effect of the strikes on
civilians, the raids remain politically sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the latest attacks on the electrical systems will
not do lasting damage to Serbian forces because military systems
are likely to be restarted again once the carbon is swept up and
the transformers restarted.
</P>
<P>
   But if the attacks are repeated, critics say, they may force the
shut down of plants for water purification and sewage treatment,
undercutting NATO's assertion that it is not at war with the
Yugoslav people, and undermining public support for the allied
military campaign in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take a consistent effort to take out the national
electrical grid,'' said William Arkin, a military consultant to
Human Rights Watch. ``That would have an onerous effect on
civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on Yugoslavia's electrical system were directed at
five large installations that distribute power, including one at
Obrenovac, which transfers power to Western Serbia and a
transformer at Nis, which NATO says provides power to the Yugoslav
3rd Army in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Other electrical transformers that were attacked are located at
Bajina Basta, Drmno, Novi Sad.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials emphasized that allied planes had not destroyed
the installations. Instead, they dropped ``soft bombs'' that spewed
strands of carbon, short-circuiting the electrical transmission
equipment. It was as if the transmission equipment had been hit by
a lightening strike.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon declined to give details about the new bomb, saying
it was highly classified. A similar technique, however, was used
during the 1991 Persian Gulf war when sea-launched cruise missiles
carrying spools of carbon filament were fired at Iraq's electrical
grid.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity has long been one of the most politically sensitive
of targets. Early in the Persian Gulf war, Iraq's electrical system
was attacked and experts still debate the military usefulness of
the raids and their effects on Iraqi civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Allied war planners insisted those attacks on the Iraqi
electrical grid were needed to hamper Iraq's air defenses,
especially during the initial stages of that air campaign. While
many Iraqi military units had back-up generators, relying on them
in the early days of the war could be disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the caution with which NATO diplomats have overseen
the gradual escalation of the air campaign against Yugoslavia,
however, attacks against electrical transformers and distribution
centers have not taken place until the sixth week of bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the diplomats insisted Monday, they were needed to
disrupt military communications systems, hamper military
headquarters and interfere with air defense systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Command and control or a computer in military hands without
electricity simply becomes a mass of metal, wire and plastic,''
Shea said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman declined to say whether the strikes would be
carried out regularly, but they suggested that they would need to
be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats also indicated that they wanted to limit the effect on
civilians. Because Yugoslavia provides power to neighboring
countries, NATO also does not want to completely disable it,
according to NATO's military spokesman, German Maj. Gen. Walter
Jertz.
</P>
<P>
   Jertz said that Yugoslav authorities had restored much of the
electricity in a matter of hours. Reports from Belgrade Monday
night, however, indicated that many people were spending a second
night without electricity. State television was of the air and
traffic lights were not operating.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's strikes on electricity was not the only difficult
question NATO faced Monday. Serb television alleged that allied
warplanes had bombed a bus full of civilians on the road between
Pec and Rozage in Montenegro. One report quoted officials in
Montenegro as saying 17 people were killed and 21 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   NATO said it did not have any information on the incident.

 &HT;    Over sixty apartment residents homeless after fire
 &HT;    (ATTENTION: Georgia, Texas editors.)
 &HT;    By Robin McDonald and Doug Payne
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some of the 75 families at home when fire roared
through luxury apartments Monday have told fire investigators that
sprinklers never worked and fire alarms were silent during the
blaze.
</P>
<P>
   The four-alarm fire began about 6 p.m. in Building 200 of the
Summer Lakeside Apartments in north Fulton County. Some of the
residents were just sitting down to TV or coming home from work.
</P>
<P>
   The apartment building, completed in June, was equipped with
smoke detectors inside individual apartments and outside, in
addition to a sprinkler system.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported late Monday night, but residents were
shaken by alarms that remained silent and sprinklers that stayed
dry throughout the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the building's estimated 100-125 residents were alerted
by quick-thinking neighbors who pounded on doors and shouted to
clear the building.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 64 of the 75 apartments in Building 200 were
destroyed by flames, smoke and water, according to fire officials.
</P>
<P>
   A.D. Bell Sr., assistant fire chief for Fulton County, said fire
investigators questioned the complex's maintence man, who said the
sprinkler system had been installed but didn't know if it was
working.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (the maintenance man) was not sure whether the sprinkler
system had pressure on it or not,'' Bell said. ``Fire codes require
the system have pressure at all times and if he was working on it,
he should've told us.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire investigators reported the fire appeared to have started
outside the building, probably on a balcony on the second or third
floor, and spread up the building's outer walls and into the attic.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said it's possible that if the flames spread in that manner
_ above alarms and sprinklers _ it might offer an explanation for
the systems not working. Bell said the investigation into the fire
must be finished before he can confirm such a scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Apartment managers were on hand at the fire, but refused to
speak to reporters. Mark Borders, leasing manager for Summer
Lakeside Apartments, said the complex is owned by Walton Concierge
Service of Houston, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Residents also told firefighters that smoke detectors in
individual apartments didn't sound, but Bell said that may be
because the smoke hadn't reached them at the time. Residents said
they believe their individual smoke detectors are working because
they have gone off numerous times when cooking. Despite early
reports that firefighters were hampered by a nearby water main
break earlier in the day, Bell denied that there was any difficulty
on that account. ``What we do know is the water main break had no
impact on the operation of the fire hydrants in this complex.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire, which began at about 6 p.m., took more than an hour to
contain and required 60 firefighters drawn from Fulton, DeKalb and
Cobb counties.
</P>
<P>
   The four-story building had garages on the bottom floor.
Apartment rents ranged from $770 for a one-bedroom unit to $1,200
for a two-bedroom unit, according to residents.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Pace was at home in her second-floor apartment when a man
ran down the hall banging on the doors.
</P>
<P>
   Pace ran out of her apartment barefoot to find the hall filled
with smoke, but she heard no fire alarms in the hall. She said the
stairwell also was filled with smoke. She passed by the apartment
where she believes the fire started and said no sprinklers were
activated.
</P>
<P>
   She called her fiance, Mike Hammer, from her cell phone in her
car. Hammer said when he arrived, firefighters appeared to be
having trouble getting the water pressure they needed to fill their
hoses.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer said they had looked at a number of complexes making sure
the apartment they rented would have adequate fire alarms and
protection.
</P>
<P>
   ''But no alarms went off. No sprinklers went off. ... There are
sprinklers in the building. I wouldn't have rented here if there
hadn't been,'' Hammer said. ``When you've bought into that and it
doesn't work, it's very disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammer and Pace are planning to get married May 15.
</P>
<P>
   ''All our clothing, our rings are in there,'' Pace said.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials were unable to confirm rumors that the fire began
with an outdoor grill.
</P>
<P>
   Residents recalled that about two weeks ago the complex sent a
notice around warning against grills, saying they were a violation
of the fire code.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Roberts, who has lived in the complex since October, said
he heard a maintenance man shouting about the fire. He said the
sprinkler system never came on as he joined in, running through the
building pounding on doors and occasionally kicking them in,
because ``you never know who can't hear or who's sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts also tried to save residents' pets. One dog ran past him
and down the stairs. ``I just let it go.'' Eric Brown, 31, said he
was coming home from work when he saw the flames and smoke. He ran
into the building to rescue his cats at about 6 p.m. and said he
questioned why there were no alarms or sprinklers operating, but
added, ``It was a little too late to worry about it at that time.''
He rescued one cat and found the other outside after the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Tami Hartman, 27, a teacher, was watching the news on TV and
paying her bills when someone ran past her apartment and banged on
the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a guy. He said, 'You might want to get out.' I
thought, 'What am I supposed to take with me?' `` Hartman
recounted. She escaped barefoot, wearing a 1991 T-shirt from a frat
party, carrying her bills and her insurance file. As she ran out,
she said she smelled smoke, but heard no alarms.
</P>
<P>
   After the blaze was almost extinguished,Tina White, 27, a
resident of apartment 213 since July, was worrying over the loss of
her boyfriend's 1990 championship ring from Georgia Tech. ``I've
got renter's insurance, but that won't take care of the memories.''

 &HT;    Debate on Bell pricing bill uncovers concerns
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Even as Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. scored a
major regulatory victory last week before the Public Utility
Commission, it suffered a late-night embarrassment before the House
State Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The committee was considering a bill that would provide
Southwestern Bell with much of the price deregulation that it
wants. But the two lawmakers sponsoring the bill, Reps. Leticia Van
De Putte, D-San Antonio, and Toby Goodman, R-Arlington, found
themselves on the defensive, denying they were messengers for the
company and struggling to explain the bill's fine points.
</P>
<P>
   With so much at stake for so many different parties if
Southwestern Bell prevails, emotions were running high at the
hearing, which finally was cut off at 1 a.m. Friday and resumed
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's chairman, Rep. Steve Wolens, D-Dallas,
complained at one point that he was having so much trouble pulling
out complete answers to his questions that he was ``feeling like a
dentist,'' and he was still angry the next day, calling the hearing
``terrible . . . it was dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, it remained unclear what damage, if any, there
was to Southwestern Bell's hopes of getting more freedom to raise
and lower prices without state approval. The legislative session
ends May 31.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, the most visible part of this debate has been a
barrage of opposing television commercials by Southwestern Bell and
a coalition led by AT&AMP;T. The gist of each company's ad is that
their competitor would raise prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has passed a bill that would give Southwestern Bell
more pricing freedom under various conditions, but in the House,
Van De Putte and Goodman have substituted for it a version far more
favorable to the company, whose parent, SBC Communications Inc., is
based in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two lawmakers said they are not carrying the bill
for Southwestern Bell, both showed the effects Thursday night of a
barrage of criticism about the legislation from AT&AMP;T, other
telephone companies and consumer groups such as Consumers Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you, I have not enjoyed at all just the slightest
inference that I'm carrying water for Bell,'' Van De Putte said at
the hearing. ``And in some cases, people have said that I'm their
`ho.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman withered under Wolens' detailed questioning, finally
saying at one point that he was ``going nuts with this damn
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolens, a highly successful courtroom litigator and generally
regarded as a consumer advocate, seemed particularly provoked by a
feeling that Southwestern Bell and the Texas Association of
Broadcasters had not been totally candid about language in the bill
that would appear to make it easier for Southwestern Bell to offer
video services.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, Ann Arnold, you should have been more forthcoming
tonight . . . it would have been nicer if you had been more
forthcoming rather than my pulling all this stuff out of you,''
Wolens said to Arnold, executive director of the broadcasters'
association.
</P>
<P>
   David Cole, a Southwestern Bell lobbyist, defended the provision
on the grounds that the company would provide additional
competition in the cable market.
</P>
<P>
   That Southwestern Bell is interested in video services indicates
just how complicated this fight is. The main issues are:
</P>
<P>
   _Southwestern Bell wants a lot more freedom from state
regulations to raise and lower the prices that it charges for its
numerous services so that it can meet what it sees as a coming
assault by AT&AMP;T. AT&AMP;T has been buying up or getting access to cable
systems as a way of ``wiring around'' Southwestern Bell to new
customers, not just for long-distance service but also for local
phone and computer services. Last week Southwestern Bell won a
major victory when the PUC effectively agreed to recommend to
federal regulators that it be allowed to sell long-distance service
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   _AT&AMP;T and MCI WorldCom want a sharp reduction in the ``access
fee'' of 12 cents a minute that they and other long-distance
companies must pay Southwestern Bell to complete their in-state
long-distance calls.
</P>
<P>
   _AT&AMP;T says Southwestern Bell has no real competition yet, so it
should remain regulated.
</P>
<P>
   _A separate group of relatively small phone companies, trying to
get a toehold in the telecommunications market, is less concerned
about Southwestern Bell's entrance into the long-distance market
than about the company's ability to underprice them in competition
for business customers. Giving Southwestern Bell more price
flexibility on local services now while letting it into the
long-distance market is ``tantamount to giving Bell nuclear
weapons,'' warned Royce Holland, chairman of Allegiance Telecom of
Texas Inc.
</P>
<P>
   _Consumers Union fears that Southwestern Bell will lower prices
for business customers, making up for it by raising prices on
residential customers. While Southwestern Bell has agreed to freeze
basic local residential rates until 2005, under the bill it would
be free to raise prices on a number of other services, such as
caller identification. Most of these services now have rate caps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do they have to take the cap off services like caller
return and caller ID unless they intend to raise the price?'' asked
Janee Briesemeister, a policy analyst for Consumers Union.

MCKIENZIE PROVING FAMILY WAS RIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ What kind of parents would let their
teen-age son move to a land where temptations are as bountiful as
palm trees?
</P>
<P>
   That was the question more than a few neighbors were asking in
Littleton, Colo., when Dave McKienzie came to Southern California
to live with his sister so he could finish his final two years of
high school and pursue his love for volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   Joy was barely out of college herself _ and just how could
William and Elvira McKienzie let a capricious kid like Dave out of
their sight?
</P>
<P>
   It was like mixing a Molotov cocktail, heaping that much freedom
on someone so young and undirected. That's what the community
pretty much concluded, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1994, five years before parental responsibility would
literally explode as a topic of conversation in Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were saying a lot of things about us when we
let David go live with Joy,'' Elvira McKienzie said during a recent
visit to Southern California. ``I heard a lot of people say, `What
are you doing?' I said to my husband, `This is between us. It's
going to be nobody's fault if something happens.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, something has happened. Something stupendous.
</P>
<P>
   David McKienzie has blossomed as a volleyball player and a
person. The sophomore outside hitter will lead Long Beach State
(22-3) against Indiana-Purdue at Fort Wayne on Thursday in an NCAA
Final Four semifinal at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Last month McKienzie set an NCAA record with 58 kills in a
five-game upset of previously unbeaten BYU in Provo. He has been on
a tear since the beginning of March, averaging one-third of his
team's kills in the last 13 matches.
</P>
<P>
   If the NCAA tournament seedings hold, the 49ers would play the
top-seeded Cougars again on Saturday for the national title. If
that happens, more records could be endangered along with a few
Cougars caught in the crossfire. It's a sickening thought for BYU
fans, but McKienzie wasn't close to full strength in that March 19
match.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, the 6-3 McKienzie drew the short straw and had
to sleep on a sofa-bed while teammate Corey Peters slept on a
queen-sized bed. He didn't sleep much and, to top it off, he awoke
the day of the match with a fever and the chills. He wasn't sure
he'd be able to play until after the pregame warmups.
</P>
<P>
   Powered by Advil, McKienzie lowered the anvil on the Cougars. In
the deciding game he accounted for all but two of his team's kills.
</P>
<P>
   Even before he realized he had just done something special (he
was unaware of the record at first), McKienzie grasped a much
greater truth. What little pep he had, he put into each point.
There was no beating himself up after every little mistake. He
simply didn't have the energy to waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just going hard,'' McKienzie said. ``I wasn't thinking
too much.''
</P>
<P>
   In a game that relies on reaction and reflexes, thinking can
trip you up faster than untied shoelaces. Of course, life also can
punish those hooked on reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   When McKienzie broached the subject of living with Joy, a setter
on the 1993 national champion Long Beach State women's team, there
were plenty of reasons for his parents to say no. There also was
one very compelling reason to say yes.
</P>
<P>
   William McKienzie was battling cancer and it was hard for his
family to see the illness slowly eating away at him. A former
volleyball player who once played for the U.S. in the Pan American
Games, William was the one who introduced his children to the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   Once the family decided it would be a good thing for David to go
live with Joy, William was the one who sent him off with a book of
inspirational stories and messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband was like the FBI,'' Elvira said, chuckling. ``He'd
call David and Joy and I'd listen to how he'd interrogate them. He
was a very principled person and he raised his children to be that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   William McKienzie died in 1997, the same year his son graduated
All-Everything from Huntington Beach High.
</P>
<P>
   The father continues to counsel the son, by way of the handmade
book that is like a Bible to David.
</P>
<P>
   When McKienzie lost his starting job to Neil Mason early in the
season because of poor practice habits, he turned to the book and
read a story about Larry Bird. The Boston Hall of Fame basketball
player was quoted as saying he always tried to work harder than the
next guy because somewhere there was someone else taking one more
shot before heading to the showers.
</P>
<P>
   That struck a chord in McKienzie. He started bringing his game
face to practice and the Cougars saw the results. After his
record-setting performance, McKienzie phoned his mother in
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   He sounded so giddy, Elvira found herself smiling into the
receiver. She told him, ``I bet your dad is bragging about you,
David,'' then hung up, secure in the knowledge that she and her
late husband had done right by their son, no matter what anybody
said.

NORTEL PLANS NEW PRODUCT TO BOLSTER OPTICAL NETWORKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nortel Networks Corp. plans to announce Tuesday that it has
developed a new product that could increase the capacity of fiber
optic communications networks far beyond current technologies.
</P>
<P>
   If the new product successfully makes the transitions from the
laboratory to field trials to the marketplace, it could shore up
Nortel's standing as a leader in optical networking. Nortel, which
changed its name last month from Northern Telecom Ltd. of Canada,
is battling rivals ranging from giants like Lucent Technologies to
start-ups like Sycamore Networks to develop advanced communications
technologies needed to meet rapidly increasing global demand for
Internet data.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of that battle's ferocity, Lucent plans to announce a
product similar to the new Nortel unit in about a month, executives
close to that plan said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The product Nortel intends to announce Tuesday may be as far as
a year away from the marketplace. Nortel hopes to announce a
communications carrier to try the new system within a few weeks and
to begin trials in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The new product could become the most advanced member in a new
family of technologies called wave division multiplexing, which
transmit multiple wavelengths of light, or colors, over a single
optical fiber. A wave-division-multiplexing unit that uses eight
channels, each a different color, could lift the capacity of a
network by eight times a traditional single-wavelength system.
</P>
<P>
   The new Nortel product uses 160 channels, and each channel can
transmit 10 billion bits of information a second. Altogether, the
new system could transmit 1.6 trillion bits a second over a single
optical fiber _ enough capacity to transmit the entire contents of
the Library of Congress across the country in 14 seconds, Nortel
said.
</P>
<P>
   The most advanced unit that Nortel is now shipping offers only
32 channels, but the new unit would leap-frog the most advanced
wave-division-multiplexing products now being sold by its main
competitors: Lucent, Ciena, Fujitsu of Japan and Pirelli of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst said a product such as Nortel's would offer more
capacity than the communications industry needs now but added that
it could be well suited to the communications appetites of even the
near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our best guess would be that putting this technology out there
is before the market needs,'' said Steven D. Levy, a data
communications analyst with Lehman Brothers, speaking generally
about a super-advanced wave-division-multiplexing technology.
``However, it's only a matter of time before the market gets
there.''

JOE ADCOCK, 71, POWER HITTER FOR MILWAUKEE BRAVES
</HEADLINE>
   (lh) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe Adcock, the Milwaukee Braves' strapping first baseman who
put on some of baseball's most remarkable displays of power hitting
and broke up the longest no-hit game in major-league history, died
Monday at his home in Coushatta, La. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   He had Alzheimer's disease, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Teaming up with Hank Aaron and Eddie Mathews in a fearsome
lineup of the 1950s, the right-handed-batting, 6-foot-4-inch,
220-pound Adcock achieved a host of long-ball feats on the way to
336 career home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Adcock hit the first major-league home run to land in the
center-field bleachers at the Polo Grounds since the park had been
reconfigured in 1923, connecting on a 475-foot drive off the New
York Giants' Jim Hearn on April 29, 1953. Luke Easter had reached
the bleachers in a Negro leagues game in 1948. Lou Brock, then with
the Chicago Cubs, and Aaron would match Adcock's feat on successive
days against the Mets in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Adcock established the major-league record for total bases, at
18, when he hit four home runs and a double against the Dodgers at
Ebbets Field on July 31, 1954.
</P>
<P>
   On June 17, 1956, Adcock hit the only ball to clear the
83-foot-high, left-field roof at Ebbets Field, a homer off Ed
Roebuck that sailed out above the 350-foot mark.
</P>
<P>
   Adcock delivered a memorable drive after the Pittsburgh Pirates'
Harvey Haddix had pitched 12 perfect innings against the Braves at
County Stadium in Milwaukee the night of May 26, 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Locked in a 0-0 encounter, Haddix lost his perfect game when the
Braves' Felix Mantilla reached first base on third baseman Don
Hoak's throwing error with none out in the 13th inning. Mantilla
moved to second on a sacrifice, and Aaron was walked intentionally.
Adcock then drove the ball over the right-center-field fence for an
apparent home run and a 3-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Mantilla scored, but Adcock was called out for passing Aaron on
the basepaths. Adcock was given a double, and the game became a 1-0
Braves victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind had been blowing in all night, and maybe it was a
freak because when I came to bat, the flag in center field was
still,'' Adcock would recall. ``I was thinking he'd been keeping
the ball away from me all night and maybe he'd do it again, and he
did and I hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Adcock was an intimidating presence even without a bat. After
being hit on the wrist by the Giants right-hander Ruben Gomez at
Milwaukee in July 1956, Adcock charged at Gomez. The pitcher then
threw the baseball at Adcock, hitting him on the thigh, and raced
into the New York dugout with Adcock in pursuit. Gomez, 4 inches
shorter and 45 pounds lighter than Adcock, escaped. Gomez was
suspended by the National League for three days.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Coushatta, Adcock was signed by the Cincinnati Reds
out of Louisiana State University, which he attended on a
basketball scholarship, and made his major-league debut in 1950. He
had a lifetime batting average of .277 over 17 seasons with the
Reds, Braves, Indians and Angels.
</P>
<P>
   He managed Cleveland to an eighth-place finish in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Joan; a son, Jay; three daughters,
Jan Adams, Jill Kennedy and Jeannie Worsham; a sister, Mary Ann
Brown, and eight grandchildren.

VENCOR MISSES DEBT PAYMENT, RAISING QUESTION OF SURVIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky.)  (mk) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vencor Inc., one of several troubled nursing-home chains, missed
a payment on its debt Monday, providing new fodder for investor
concerns about its ability to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which said last month that its survival was an
issue, said Monday that it would not pay $14.8 million due in
interest on $300 million of notes that mature in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Battered by Medicare cutbacks and heavy financial losses,
Vencor, which is based in Louisville, Ky., is trying to negotiate
new terms from banks and Ventas Inc., a real estate investment
trust that retained almost all the properties when Vencor split in
two early last year.
</P>
<P>
   With Monday's announcement, Vencor said it had opened a 35-day
period before the banks could demand repayment and force it to seek
protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law, an
action that could also push Ventas to seek bankruptcy protection.
The banks had already set a deadline of May 28 for Vencor to comply
with the terms of its loans.
</P>
<P>
   Vencor said last month in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission that it had a deficit of $683 million in
working capital. It reported a loss of more than $600 million in
the fourth quarter of 1998. Medicare officials have demanded the
return of $90 million that the government said were overcharges.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Vencor, which have lost most of their value this year,
fell 6.25 cents Monday to 87.5 cents, on the New York Stock
Exchange. Shares of Ventas fell 12.5 cents, to $4.375. Bonds of
Vencor have plunged 82 percent since January. They were bid Monday
at about 15.5 cents on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the crux of the problems at Vencor, one of the
nation's largest operators of nursing homes and hospitals for
long-term patients, was the refusal of a co-founder, W. Bruce
Lunsford, to reduce the rents the company pays. Lunsford, who
resigned as Vencor's chief executive in January, still holds that
post at Ventas, the real estate investment trust that holds the
leases on most of the facilities Vencor operates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not looking good for Vencor,'' said Lori Price, a health
care analyst at CIBC Oppenheimer. She said the banks would probably
act to protect their stake unless Lunsford agreed to rent
concessions.
</P>
<P>
   But another analyst who specializes in troubled companies said
that Lunsford had strong reasons to keep Vencor afloat. He added
that other nursing home operators would also insist on low rental
terms because most of the industry is struggling with cuts in
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The analyst, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that
if Vencor foundered, Ventas would be stuck with more than $200
million it had guaranteed for leases that Vencor has with other
landlords.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Vencor refused to comment Monday. Officials at
Ventas did not reply to messages requesting comment.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Abramowitz, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said
the ``most logical thing'' would be for Vencor and Ventas to merge
back into one company, which would ``give them the resources to pay
all their debt and lease obligations without invoking Chapter 11.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``least logical,'' he said, would be to end up in bankruptcy
court.
</P>
<P>
   Vencor operates 60 hospitals, 309 nursing homes with 40,000
licensed beds, and related service businesses in 46 states.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in Medicare payments virtually crippled the formerly
lucrative business of providing contract therapists and other
specialized workers to many of the country's small nursing homes.
Under the new system, which took effect last summer, Medicare
typically pays a flat amount for each nursing home patient instead
of paying an added fee for each service the patient receives.

AUTOPSY REPORT ON POLICE SHOTS THAT HIT DIALLO IS RELEASED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The official autopsy of Amadou Diallo has found that
of the 19 police bullets that hit him, one traveled up his right
leg, while a second pierced the sole of his right sneaker,
according to a report by the city's Medical Examiner's office.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Diallo family have argued that based on an
independent autopsy they had arranged, these shots are evidence
that Diallo was fired upon by the police as he lay on the ground
after being felled by an initial barrage of bullets.
</P>
<P>
   But the Medical Examiner's report does not describe the position
of Diallo's body as individual bullets struck him and draws no
conclusions about the order in which the shots were fired.
</P>
<P>
   The report, a copy of which was obtained Monday by The New York
Times, says Diallo, who was fired upon 41 times by four police
officers, died of ``multiple gunshot wounds to trunk with
perforations of aorta, spinal cord, lungs, liver, spleen, kidney
and intestines.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the four officers, who have been indicted on charges
of second-degree murder, said they believed that the report
rebutted the contention of the Diallo family's lawyers, Peter
Neufeld, Barry Scheck and Johnnie Cochran. They argue that the
officers callously fired at Diallo as he lay on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen C. Worth, who represents Officer Edward McMellon, one of
the four officers, said the report showed that the trajectories of
many of the shots were consistent with Diallo's standing upright
when he was hit.
</P>
<P>
   Neufeld said he had no comment on the official autopsy but added
that the family's position remained unchanged. ``There are two or
more bullets which compel the inference that the police continued
to shoot him after he fell to the ground,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the indication that two of the bullets hit Diallo
after he had fallen, Worth said: ``Out of 41, is it possible that
one of them hits him as he is going down? Sure. But that is a far
cry from saying that they were shooting for sport at a prone
body.''
</P>
<P>
   The Medical Examiner's report is important evidence because
there are no witnesses to the entire sequence of events that led to
the Feb. 4 shooting of Diallo, 22, an unarmed immigrant, in the
vestibule of his Bronx apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, whose case is scheduled to be tried in January,
returned to desk jobs Monday. Meanwhile, Neufeld said Diallo's
parents filed a notice of claim with the city last week, the first
step toward filing a civil lawsuit to seek damages in the death of
their son.

ERNEST GROSS, A KEY DIPLOMAT DURING COLD WAR, DIES AT 92
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ernest A. Gross, a diplomat and an international
lawyer who was closely involved in issues of war and peace from the
Korean War to decolonization and disarmament, died on Sunday at his
home in New York City. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Gross, whose life as a diplomat began in 1931, when he joined
the State Department as legal adviser, went on to serve as a
delegate to the United Nations during a particularly tense period
in 1950. Later, he was legal counsel to Ralph Bunche, then
assistant secretary-general of the United Nations, who was called
before panels investigating his loyalty during the McCarthy period,
and to U.N. Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, Gross was among those who introduced a convention
against genocide to the United Nations, and in the 1960s, while in
private practice, he brought a suit in the World Court against the
South African government for its policies of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   But the most dramatic period in Gross' long public career took
place soon after he was appointed by Secretary of State Dean
Acheson to be America's deputy delegate to the United Nations on
Oct. 11, 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Warren Austin, the chief delegate, took a
leave of absence and Gross, a soft-spoken and scholarly
professional, took over the effort to parry Soviet attempts to
transfer China's U.N. seat to the Communists, who had just won the
civil war, from Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists, who had just fled
the mainland for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   It was on Jan. 13, 1950, when Gross was attending his first
meeting of the Security Council, that Jacov Malik, the Soviet
delegate, walked out of a discussion over China's representation.
For reasons that have generated wonder and debate ever since, Malik
stayed away from the Council in protest for months. He was still
absent on June 25, when North Korea invaded the South. By the end
of that day, the Security Council, unrestrained by the threat of a
Soviet veto, condemned the North Korean attack and called for the
withdrawal of Kim Il Sung's forces.
</P>
<P>
   Many years later, Gross discussed what seemed to be Malik's
extraordinary blunder, which allowed the United Nations not merely
to vote for a peacekeeping force, but to brand one warring party as
the initiator of conflict and commit unequivocal support to the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Soviets felt they had very little, if anything, to
worry about,'' Gross said in 1975. ``They did not anticipate that
the Security Council would take action.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, Austin returned to take over the American
delegation again and Gross resumed work as his deputy, leaving in
1953 to enter private practice as a partner in the law firm Curtis,
Mallet-Prevost, Colt &AMP; Mosle. He remained affiliated with the firm
until his death.
</P>
<P>
   Gross was born in Brooklyn on Sept. 23, 1906. He graduated from
Harvard College in 1927. After studying and rowing at Oxford
University, he returned to Harvard for Law School and met Kathryn
Watson, the daughter of Sen. James Watson, R-Ind. They were married
in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL MATERIAL)
</P>
<P>
   That same year, Gross left the State Department and signed on as
a division counsel for the National Recovery Administration, the
agency coordinating President Franklin D. Roosevelt's
anti-Depression strategies. A year later, Gross left government
service and served as counsel for the National Association of
Manufacturers. In 1940, he returned to public life, as associate
counsel for the National Labor Relations Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the only living man who ever went from the NAM to the
NLRB,'' said Gross, speaking of the two organizations, the first of
which scorned labor unions while the other empowered them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943, he was commissioned as a captain in the Army, and then
promoted to lieutenant colonel when he served the chief of the
economic section of the Civil Affairs Division of the War
Department General Staff. With peace he returned to the State
Department, serving as deputy to the assistant secretary of state
for occupied areas. From 1948 until 1953, he was with the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   But some of that involvement with the world body spanned a much
longer time. For example, it was Gross who, representing the United
States, signed the U.N. Genocide convention in 1948. On the eve of
the General Assembly vote, he had urged approval for the treaty
``before the memory of recent horrifying genocidal acts has faded
from the minds and conscience of man.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote passed but it would take another four decades years
before the United States would ratify the convention. In 1985,
Gross, a prolific and lifelong writer of letters to editors, felt
impelled to write a letter to The New York Times rejecting the
reservations to ratification that had been raised in an op-ed
article by Sen. Orin Hatch, R-Utah. ``The convention should have
been ratified long ago,'' Gross wrote.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL MATERIAL)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by three children,
Suzanne Wolff of Baltimore, Peter W. Gross of San Francisco and
Catherine Gross of New York, and 10 grandchildren.

 &HT;    Braves strike for 3 in 8th, trump Cards
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox New sService
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The last time Brian Hunter saw a Cardinal uniform in
Atlanta, he was wearing it, but not for long. The date was July 31,
1998, and the Cardinals marked the day by releasing him.
</P>
<P>
   The wandering first baseman returned the favor Monday night. His
pinch-hit double brought in the winning run in a comeback three-run
eighth inning as the Braves opened a three-game series with St.
Louis with a 4-2 win.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves nicked St. Louis rookie Jose Jimenez for just five
hits through the first seven innings but never reached him for two
in one inning until the eighth, when Chipper Jones walked, Brian
Jordan singled up the middle and Javy Lopez tied the score with
sharp single to left.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Scott Radinsky, who entered the game with a 7.36 ERA,
then watched pinch-hitter Brian Hunter yank a double on an 0-2
count into the left field corner, scoring ex-Cardinal Jordan with
the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   After an intentional walk to Andruw Jones to load the bases,
Walt Weiss lifted a fly into shallow right field, and even with the
heavy-legged Lopez running, he scored easily for a 4-2 lead as Eric
Davis made a weak throw.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals took a 2-1 lead in the eighth. Ray Lankford could
do nothing with the first two strikes Mike Remlinger threw him but
he managed to do plenty with the third, driving his second homer of
the season into the Braves bullpen for a one-run advantage. The run
was the second allowed by Remlinger in seven relief appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Braves starter Tom Glavine worked into the seventh of a 1-1
game, when he allowed one-out singles to Jose Jimenez (1-for-17
career) and Darren Bragg, which after 121 pitches was enough for
manager Bobby Cox. Rookie Kevin McGlinchy took over and struck out
Edgar Renteria and then McGwire on a called third-strike fastball
to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing no decision, Glavine was charged with one run and seven
hits, walking two and striking out six. He lowered his ERA by more
than half a run to 4.61.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Boone collected his sixth RBI of the homestand in the
bottom of the third, tying the score 1-1 with his third double of
the season. Walt Weiss opened the inning with a walk, took second
on a Glavine groundout and scored easily when Boone dropped an
opposite-field blooper down the right field line.

NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY FAILS TO STEM CIRCULATION DROP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Months of effort by the nation's newspaper publishers to rein in
price increases and to promote their publications aggressively
failed to stem the industry's long-term circulation decline. The
latest figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulations showed average
daily circulation down five-tenths of 1 percent, while Sunday
circulation dropped by 1 percent, for the six months ending March
30.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers that showed the greatest ability to buck the
trend were those in competitive markets, like the Denver and
Minneapolis areas, or those that command a national audience, like
USA Today and The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The sharpest circulation declines among large papers came in
Boston and Philadelphia, according to the report, which did not
include the latest figures from The Buffalo News, which is owned by
Warren Buffett and had shown a 9.6 percent decline in the last
reporting period. The Boston Herald, owned by Patrick J. Purcell,
lost 9.4 percent of its circulation, which declined to 262,317. The
Philadelphia Inquirer, a Knight-Ridder publication, lost 7.3
percent of its circulation, which fell to 401,968.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Gruneich, an analyst with Bear Stearns, said: ``It really
seemed like in early 1997 the industry came to a consensus that it
wasn't going to let circulation drop any further. Soon thereafter
we saw a firming in numbers.'' He added that the latest results
were a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic increases were registered in Denver, the most
competitive newspaper market in the country, where price cuts have
been so deep that some subscribers have been able to purchase
newspapers for little more than a penny a day. The Denver Post,
owned by Media News Group, now has a circulation of 370,423, up 4.7
percent. Its rival, The Denver Rocky Mountain News, owned by E.W.
Scripps Co., gained 10.4 percent, up to 359,068 over the same
period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ABC, the average weekday sales of USA Today
reached 1,818,000, bolstered by a Friday-only circulation of more
than 2.1 million. The heavy Friday sales makes the Gannett Co.'s
flagship the best-selling newspaper in the country on average,
although Dow Jones &AMP; Co.'s national financial daily, The Wall
Street Journal, still outsells USA Today Monday through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times registered a 2.2 percent daily circulation
increase for a total circulation of 1,134,974. Daily circulation of
The New York Daily News increased by three-tenths of 1 percent, to
729,449, while The New York Post, which is owned by News Corp.,
increased to 433,744, a gain of two-tenths of 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But across the nation, such gains were the exception, not the
rule. ``The newspaper industry has had, since the invention of
television, a weakening circulation picture,'' said John Morton, an
industry analyst who runs his own company, Morton Research Inc.
``Up until the 1990s, it just meant that circulation didn't grow as
fast as households. Now it's losing ground.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The industry, he said, still has a ``very strong'' franchise.
``It's still a huge business and a huge penetration.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the newspapers showing circulation declines for their
Sunday newspapers were The Chicago Sun Times, owned by Hollinger,
whose circulation declined 2.9 percent, to 411,334; The St. Louis
Post-Dispatch, the flagship newspaper of Pulitzer Co., which lost
2.7 percent of its Sunday circulation, which declined to 524,695,
and The Boston Globe, which is owned by the New York Times Co., and
lost 2.4 percent of its Sunday circulation, which declined to
730,420.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday circulation of The Daily News of New York declined by
1.9 percent, to 835,429. The circulation of The New York Post's
Sunday edition, which was introduced in 1996 and sold nearly
300,000 copies within a year, registered its first year-to-year
decline in the latest figures, dropping by 4.7 percent, to 351,970.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday circulation of The New York Times defied this trend,
increasing to 1,687,959, or 2.3 percent.

CBS WILL MAKE IT OFFICIAL: GUMBEL IS ON MORNING TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bryant Gumbel's long-anticipated return to morning
television will become official Tuesday when CBS announces that he
has agreed to become the anchor of a revamped ``CBS This Morning''
program, which will be in a newly created studio on Fifth Avenue at
the entrance to Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   CBS will introduce Gumbel, as well as the program's new
executive producer, Steve Friedman, in a news conference scheduled
for Tuesday afternoon. The news conference will take place at the
General Motors Building, the ground floor of which CBS has leased
for use as the studio for the new morning program.
</P>
<P>
   Among others, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Donald Trump, who
manages the building, are expected to attend the news conference.
Network executives declined to comment about Gumbel's appointment.
But Friedman said the deal was in place, and the new program, with
Gumbel and a still-to-be-named female co-anchor, would be ready to
go on the air sometime in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be fun,'' Friedman said. ``We going to try to
build a franchise. You don't do it overnight. But it's great to be
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel was the anchor for NBC's ``Today'' program for 15 years,
the longest tenure on record. Friedman was his executive producer
for six of those years. Gumbel left ``Today'' in 1997 to join CBS
as the anchor of a news magazine show called ``Public Eye.''
</P>
<P>
   The network canceled that program after just one year on the air
when it failed to attract strong ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, CBS has looked for a new role for Gumbel. After ABC
revamped ``Good Morning America'' in January, replacing its hosts
with two well-known news anchors, Diane Sawyer and Charles Gibson,
Gumbel's name appeared in speculation that CBS would look for a
similar injection of star power for its morning program. ABC's
original plan to use Ms. Sawyer and Gibson as temporary
replacements has lately evolved into a much longer-term
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Today'' show has dominated the morning ratings for several
years, not missing a beat since Matt Lauer replaced Gumbel as the
co-anchor with Katie Couric.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by NBC, which is owned by General Electric, to
return ``Today'' to its 1950s roots by moving its studio to a
street location in Rockefeller Center greatly helped that show's
ratings. Tourists have flocked to stand outside the studio's
windows every morning. Now the idea of a studio that overlooks a
recognizable Manhattan location is apparently de rigueur. ``It's
become the price of admission,'' Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, a unit of Walt Disney, is also building a studio with a
Manhattan view for its morning show. The ABC studio, also expected
to be ready in the fall, is on the second floor of 1500 Broadway
overlooking Times Square.

 CYCLICALS, AGAIN, CARRY THE DOW INDUSTRIALS INTO RECORD TERRITORY
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MARK VEVERKA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
The party ain't over.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the gluttonous media feast surrounding the Dow Jones
industrials' shattering of 10,000, yesterday's romp past the 11,000
mark was more like quiet after-dinner cordials.
</P>
<P>
   While 10,000 was no more than an arbitrary benchmark, the same
holds true for 11,000 _ except that it only took 24 trading days
for the dowdy Dow to rack up another 1,000 points to smash its
latest barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, it appears that the smokestack cyclicals carried the
day. Cyclicals, as regular Street Smarts readers may know, are
stocks of companies that are directly linked to economic factors,
such as interest rates and unemployment. As you may recall, these
rather unglamorous holdings, such as Du Pont, Chevron and Minnesota
Mining and Manufacturing, helped the Dow get over the 10,000 hump
after financial stocks and drug companies did most of the heavy
lifting.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened on the way to 11,000. Cash rotated
out of many cyclicals and back into technology growth stocks for a
spell. Many of the industrials rose so high, so quickly that
concerns about their staying power began to surface. Investors
began wondering whether the strong showing by cyclicals was merely
a ``head fake,'' which is Wall Street parlance for a false start or
a short-lived surge.
</P>
<P>
   However, judging by yesterday's showing, the blue chips of the
Dow are demonstrating that their run could be real. General Motors
rose $4.69 to close at $93.75, while 3M soared $4.88 to $93.88.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Goodyear Tire and Rubber, which had been one of the
Dow's biggest laggards, jumped $3.56 to close at $60.75. The Dow
climbed about 10 percent in April compared to about 5 percent for
the broader S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you'll see these (cyclical) stocks roll over
(and decline),'' says portfolio manager Carson Levit of Dresdner
RCM Global Investors in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is going to be the start of something (more
substantial),'' Levit says.
</P>
<P>
   The industrials, and its many cyclical components, have seen a
resurgence largely because central banks around the world slashed
their interest rates. This makes it easier for foreign
manufacturers to borrow money and begin growing their businesses
again. And to do that, they will start buying oil from Chevron,
tractors from Caterpillar and trucks from General Motors, Levit
explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is extrapolating some of that global economic
strength, which is returning to a number of (American)
industries,'' Levit says. ``Their stocks are rising in anticipation
of higher earnings growth.''
</P>
<P>
   But here's the catch. While many of the world's economic markets
appear to be on the mend, they are far from fully recovered. Japan,
for example, may be near the bottom of its recession, but it is by
no means experiencing robust economic health.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it is possible that investors' expectations of the
revitalized cyclicals may get ahead of reality. In many cases, some
cyclicals _ such as Caterpillar _ have erased a year's worth of
market decline in about a month.
</P>
<P>
   Now that expectations have been raised, it's quite possible that
some of these companies won't see their businesses grow as fast as
shareholders would like, Levit warns.
</P>
<P>
   ``What could still happen is that there could be more
(international) economic weakness out there, (but) I really don't
expect that to happen,'' Levit says.
</P>
<P>
   PLUGGING IN: It is with mixed emotions that I announce I am
leaving my financial columnist post at The Chronicle at the end of
next week. I have accepted a job at Barron's as West Coast Editor
and writer of the magazine's soon-to-be weekly Plugged In
technology column. In addition to the column, I hope to do cover
stories, features and some television work for CNBC, which is a
partnership between NBC and Barron's parent _ Dow Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has only been a year since I left the Wall Street
Journal to join The Chronicle, it has been a privilege to write
this column, and I still have a handful more to file before saying
so long. I will be based in San Francisco.

 SHOOTING THE MOON _ TRANSAMERICA FUNDS SOAR ON GUTSY BETS
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By ARTHUR M. LOUIS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
O ne of the nation's most successful mutual-fund managers toils in
obscurity in a small, cluttered office in San Francisco's
Transamerica Pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Treick, 35, runs the Transamerica Premier Aggressive
Growth Fund, which soared a phenomenal 84.1 percent last year, and
the Transamerica Premier Small Company Fund, which was up 80.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index _ the principal
benchmark for institutional investors _ rose 28.6 percent,
dividends included.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggressive Growth and Small Company funds were the top
performers in their categories last year among funds tracked by
Morningstar Inc., and they ranked seventh and ninth, &LR; 
 &LR; respectively, among 3,197 domestic equity funds.
</P>
<P>
   Treick, a fast-talking, hyperkinetic native of Wyoming, joined
Transamerica as a securities analyst in 1988. He later worked on
the Transamerica trading desk and as manager of some of the
company's own assets. In July 1997, he got the opportunity to run
his first mutual fund when he was appointed manager of the newly
created aggressive growth and small company funds.
</P>
<P>
   Treick has been wise enough to follow an investment strategy
that is exactly in tune with today's wildly speculative stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   He has made big, gutsy bets on a limited number of hot
performers such as Amazon.com, Dell Computer and Cisco Systems, and
has held them tenaciously no matter how perilously high they have
soared.
</P>
<P>
   Both his funds have continued to turn in strong performances
this year. The aggressive growth fund was ahead by 23.4 percent
from the end of 1998 through last week, while the small company
fund boasted a 12.2 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the S&AMP;P 500 was up 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their brilliant records, neither of Treick's funds has
attracted vast amounts of investor money yet. They each have total
assets of around $200 million _ not much in an industry where $1
billion in assets is considered ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Treick figures that big money isn't likely to flow into his
funds until he has established more of a track record. Financial
advisers and many individual investors prefer to wait until a fund
has been around for at least three years before they will commit
substantial amounts of money.
</P>
<P>
   Treick also is handicapped by the fact that his funds are
no-loads, which means that they aren't touted by brokers. Brokers
prefer to confine their selling efforts to funds that will earn
them a commission.
</P>
<P>
   The Transamerica name might be another handicap.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is being acquired by Aegon NV, an insurer
based in the Netherlands, is widely regarded as solid but stodgy.
Its name doesn't normally conjure up images of stock-market
fireworks in the public mind.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, Transamerica actually has a notable mutual-fund
record. It can boast not only Treick's overachieving funds, but
also two above-par performers managed by his colleague Jeffrey Van
Harte, 40.
</P>
<P>
   Van Harte's Transamerica Premier Equity Fund gained 33.7 percent
in 1998, and his Transamerica Premier Balanced Fund, which invests
in bonds and money-market instruments as well as stocks, surged 29
percent.
</P>
<P>
   This year, through last week, the equity fund gained 12.3
percent, while the balanced fund rose 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Treick holds only about two dozen stocks in each of his funds,
and several of them appear in both funds, among them Amazon.com,
Alternative Living Services, Probusiness Services and Hollywood
Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Concentrating on a limited number of companies is ``great in a
market upturn,'' he says _ that is, if you pick the right
companies. With few companies in your portfolio, your hottest
performers don't get offset by a lot of so-so performers and
laggards.
</P>
<P>
   Treick contends that with his stock-picking methods you'll
probably be better off in a downturn, too.
</P>
<P>
   He focuses on companies with savvy managements, commanding
positions in their markets, strong returns on invested capital,
strong cost controls, rapid inventory turnover and heavy cash flow
that allows them to seize attractive investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that fit those parameters have usually performed
relatively well in down markets, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Treick pays little attention to earnings growth and
price-earnings ratios _ the financial gauges most commonly followed
by investors.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, his largest holding, hasn't earned a profit yet, and
Dell, one of the five largest holdings in his aggressive growth
fund, recently was selling at a hefty 80 times earnings for the
latest 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Treick notes that earnings figures can be misleading, because
companies with poor fundamentals can sometimes increase their
earnings temporarily by flooding the market with their products, or
through other forms of financial legerdemain.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, such methods ``will come back and bite them,''
he observes.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how high any of his stocks soar, he says, he will hold
them as long as their managements stick to a sound strategy. If
they do, ``the risk of a permanent decline in the stock is not very
high.''
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar analyst Emily Hall points out that Treick's
willingness to stay fully committed to his highest-flying stocks is
unusual in the fund industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot will sell, or trim back heavily, on their picks that get
very pricey,'' she observes. ``If this growth-crazy market ends,
this is the kind of fund that could _ I'm not saying will _ get
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial planner and mutual-fund devotee Kurt Brouwer, with
Brouwer &AMP; Janachowski in Tiburon, acknowledges that Treick
``probably is a very good money manager.''
</P>
<P>
   But he warns: ``When you are playing in a high-stakes game, the
cards can't always run with you. Some days they will run against
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Treick concedes that the market will move against him from time
to time. He got a taste of that in the past six trading sessions,
when Amazon.com's stock fell $59.19 to $150.94 _ a 28 percent
haircut.
</P>
<P>
   But he says he is so confident in his investment strategy that
he considers his funds appropriate investments for any and all
investors willing to hold their shares for at least 18 months. If
you wait that long, he explains, you should be able to ride out any
serious downturns.

JURY PICKED IN LOUIMA CASE; OFFICERS' TRIAL TO OPEN TUESDAY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After five weeks of effort, a jury was selected
Monday for the long-awaited trial of four police officers accused
of brutalizing a Haitian immigrant. Opening statements and the
first witnesses are expected Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a highly controversial case with bitter racial overtones, the
federal jury that will decide whether the immigrant, Abner Louima,
was tortured in a Brooklyn police station after his arrest in a
street brawl in 1997 comprises eight white people, one black person
and three people who identified themselves as Hispanic, lawyers in
the case said.
</P>
<P>
   The names of the jurors will not be disclosed to the public or
to the defense and prosecution lawyers, under a ruling by Judge
Eugene H. Nickerson. He decided during the pretrial proceedings in
the Brooklyn courtroom to withhold the names in hopes of insuring
that outside pressures do not affect the jurors' judgments.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it could not be learned where the jurors live. The
federal district from which they were chosen comprises three of the
city's five boroughs _ Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island _ and
Long Island. The jurors' occupations or vocations were also not
revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Nickerson interviewed more than 200 jury candidates over 10
days. The 12 jurors chosen will weigh testimony and arguments in
what prosecutors have described as one of the most explosive and
graphic cases of police brutality in New York City in years.
</P>
<P>
   The four officers _ Justin A. Volpe, Charles Schwarz, Thomas
Wiese and Thomas Bruder _ are charged with violating Louima's civil
rights. Prosecutors say they beat him without justification in a
police car after his arrest in a melee outside a Brooklyn nightclub
in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors say that later, at the 70th Precinct station
house, Volpe rammed a stick into Louima's rectum and then his
mouth, causing severe injuries to his rectum and bladder, while
Schwarz held him down. A sergeant, Michael Bellomo, is also on
trial, charged with trying to cover up the beating in the police
car.
</P>
<P>
   All five defendants call the charges untrue.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   During the process Monday of choosing the 12 jurors and six
alternates from the preliminary panel, prosecutors from the U.S.
Attorney's office and the defense lawyers exchanged accusations
that each side was using its challenges in an illegal effort to
exclude people from the jury for racial reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors contended that the defense lawyers were trying
to exclude four members of minority groups, but Nickerson rejected
the accusation in three instances, finding that the defense had
given acceptable reasons, unrelated to race, for rejecting those
prospective jurors. In the fourth instance, he upheld the
prosecution's accusation and that juror was seated.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the defense lawyers accused the prosecution of trying
to exclude three white people because of their race. Nickerson
rejected the defense accusation in all three instances and those
prospective jurors were not seated.  &QL;

GIULIANI AND SCHOOLS CHIEF MEET 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After two weeks of bitter sparring, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew finally met face to face
Monday, but studiously avoided any mention of the issues that have
divided them _ school vouchers and mayoral control of the public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The two men emerged separately from the City Hall meeting, which
lasted more than an hour. Crew looked strained and smiled wanly as
he walked out.
</P>
<P>
   Crew said the meeting had focused on more immediate issues _ the
board's plan to end social promotion and its $11 billion plan to
repair crumbling schools and relieve overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just walked in and said, `Hi, how you doing?' shook hands
and sat down,'' Crew said, adding that the ensuing discussion was
``typical'' of their standing Monday meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Crew had left, Giuliani strode down the steps of
City Hall, grinning broadly, and walked straight to his car, which
was waiting to take him to an appointment at the Brooklyn Navy
Yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a businesslike meeting,'' the mayor said after arriving
in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The low-key tone belied the magnitude of the gulf that has
opened in recent weeks, as the two have engaged in an escalating
campaign of recriminations over the state of the public schools and
how to fix them.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's ability to set the education agenda in New York City
is at stake, as well as whether Crew will be able to continue as
the leader of the nation's largest school system.
</P>
<P>
   The focus on more routine educational matters Monday reflected a
new strategy of waiting each other out, rather than direct
confrontation, aides to both men said. But Giuliani hinted that he
had not backed down on vouchers or dismantling the Board of
Education and that the overt war of the last two weeks might simply
have converted into a cold war. ``As to the rest of it, you know,
we'll continue to evaluate and I'll make my judgment in the
future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A close adviser to the mayor said he would not be surprised to
see the dispute resurface, though it was hard to predict when. ``I
see them getting further apart rather than closer,'' the adviser
said.

 WEB AD SPENDING PASSES OUTDOOR MEDIUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CAROL EMERT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
Just a few years into the World Wide Web's existence, advertising
expenditures on the Internet have surpassed spending on outdoor
ads, an old-as-the-hills medium that includes billboards and taxi
tops.
</P>
<P>
   Spending on Web banner ads, site sponsorships and e-mail
marketing more than doubled in 1998 to $1.92 billion from $906.5
million in 1997, according to a study released yesterday by the
Internet Advertising Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Spending on outdoor ads, meanwhile, totaled $1.5 billion, the
IAB said, citing data from New York ad agency McCann Erickson
Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are remarkable given that the Web is an infant
medium while outdoor ads have been around since Coca-Cola was a
snazzy new drink and Prince Albert tobacco ads graced the sides of
New England barns.
</P>
<P>
   The relative expenditures are also somewhat surprising given
that click-through rates of Web ads _ the frequency with which
people click on the ads _ are falling. As the novelty of banner ads
wanes, click-through rates have fallen to less than .5 percent,
compared with about 1 percent just a year ago, according to
NetRatings.
</P>
<P>
   What the numbers don't reveal is how much of Web ad spending
stems from a calculated strategy and how much is driven by the hype
and optimism that are propelling Net stocks through the roof.
</P>
<P>
   People who make their living from digital marketing acknowledge
that they are working in the equivalent of the Stone Age of the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Internet's strength as an advertising medium may lie
in the future, when, for example, advertisers will be able to
target ads to surfers based on their buying patterns or demographic
characteristics. This is now done to a limited extent by
advertisers on just a few sites.
</P>
<P>
   Even the information generated by tracking ``clickstreams'' is
not being fully utilized. A survey by Jupiter Communications
released yesterday found that only 22 percent of Web advertisers
``make optimal use of clickstream data _ data that is critical to
making intelligent, cost-effective marketing decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's common now for everyone to measure click-through,'' said
Ken Sacharin, media director of Young &AMP; Rubicam San Francisco.
``The new challenge is to measure other things, like what is the
cost per qualified lead,'' in other words, how much it costs to
send an ad to a surfer who meets a profile the advertiser is
targetting.
</P>
<P>
   ``At an even higher level, we want to measure who makes further
inquiries into a product or service, who bought something and who
returned to buy something again,'' said Sacharin.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even with the rudimentary tracking being done today,
``We're already measuring our online campaigns with greater rigor
than we do our offline campaigns in general,'' said Sacharin.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Tim Meadows, vice president of marketing with NetRatings,
``It's hard to click on a billboard and buy something. The Web is
not just a medium that provides content and context but a
marketplace that actually lets people conduct business on it.''
</P>
<P>
   By one measure, Web ads are a bargain. Last year, Net
advertising accounted for about 1 percent of the total $200 billion
in U.S. annual ad spending, yet Web-viewing time accounts for
between 4 and 5 percent of time exposed to all media by the average
American, said Sacharin.
</P>
<P>
   If those revenues were distributed evenly, ``the Web would be
getting $8 (billion) to $10 billion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Pete Petrusky, director of new media for
PricewaterhouseCoopers, ``I think we're in the first inning of
what's going to be an extra-inning game.''
</P>
<P>
   Other findings from the study, which was conducted for the IAB
by &UR;  &LR; Petrusky's team at PricewaterhouseCoopers:
</P>
<P>
   _ Consumer product advertising accounted for 29 percent of Web
ad spending, computers made up 20 percent, financial services 19
percent, telecommunications 8 percent and new media 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Barter deals comprised only 6 percent of Web ad revenues, with
93 percent of such deals paid for in cash. The remaining 1 percent
were parts of broader packages.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fifty-six percent of expenditures were for banner ads, site
sponsorships made up 30 percent, full-screen animated
``interstitials'' 5 percent and e-mail ads 1 percent. A
miscellaneous category accounted for 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ A growing number of Web sites price ads according to
performance benchmarks _ such as whether viewers clicked on the ad
_ instead of simply measuring how many times the ad was flashed on
computer screens. Forty percent of ad spending was priced simply
according to the CPM, or cost per thousand times the banner flashed
on a computer screen. Six percent of ad spending was based purely
on performance measures. The majority, 54 percent of ads, were
``hybrid'' deals that included both cost per thousand and
performance measures.

 SPRINT BUYING WIRELESS FIRMS TO OFFER LOCAL PHONE, NET SERVICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DEBORAH SOLOMON &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
SAN FRANCISCO -- Sprint Corp. said Monday that it is buying two
wireless companies with a major presence in the Bay Area, giving
consumers here a way to get local phone service and high-speed
Internet access from Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City, Mo., company said it has agreed to acquire
Videotron USA of Montreal and Transworld Telecommunications Inc. of
Salt Lake City for $210 million.
</P>
<P>
   Videotron and Transworld own a Mountain View company called
Wavepath, which provides wireless Internet access through various
Internet service providers in the Bay Area. Videotron owns 62
percent of Wavepath and Transworld Telecommunications owns 38
percent
</P>
<P>
   The deal will give Sprint a way to offer service to more than
6.4 million homes in the Bay Area; Seattle and Spokane, Wash.;
Tampa, Fla.; and Greenville, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint has been searching for a way to get into customers' homes
and businesses so it can sell its Integrated-on-Demand network. ION
will let customers talk on the phone, receive faxes and access the
Internet simultaneously. Sprint plans to offer local, long-distance
and high-speed Internet service over ION, a $2 billion, digital
network the company is building.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Sprint had to lease telephone lines from the Baby
Bells, such as Pacific Bell, to get its service to the end-user.
Buying Videotron and Transworld will allow Sprint to bypass the
Baby Bells and avoid paying costly fees to link to their networks.
Instead, Sprint will offer most customers a wireless connection to
the ION network.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint bought two other wireless cable operators last month _
American Telecasting and People's Choice T _ which operate in other
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of this is we can supply a big pipe and get into
customers' homes while bypassing the local phone companies,'' said
Russ Robinson, a spokesman for Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Wavepath transmits data wirelessly through a
technology called Multipoint Multichannel Distribution Service.
MMDS uses a special radio frequency that allows customers to
wirelessly connect to the Internet at speeds of about 384 kilobits
per second.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area customers who want to use Sprint's ION network will
attach an antenna to the side of their house to connect to one of
Sprint's cellular towers around the Bay Area. The service will be
rolled out in the Bay Area in early 2000 and will cost between $100
and $150 for the entire package of local, long-distance and
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Wavepath currently operates in the Bay Area through various
ISPs, including Concentric Network and Slip.Net. Wavepath and its
ISP partners market primarily to corporate customers, but Robinson
said Sprint will sell the service to residential and small-business
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's Robinson said ION will appeal to customers who have
multiple phone lines, Internet service and more than $50 a month in
long-distance bills.
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers said Sprint's purchase is a defensive move
against AT&AMP;T and other telecommunications companies that are
planning their own digital, high-speed networks.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T plans to offer local phone and high-speed Internet service
through TCI's cable TV lines. MCI is looking at wireless for part
of its network and bought a wireless company last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a reflection of Sprint's desperate need to get to the
home,'' said Andrew Cole, vice president of Renaissance Worldwide,
a Boston consulting firm. ``They need to compete with AT&AMP;T and are
being forced to find a way around the Baby Bells. MMDS can
transport data and very often voice as well at high rates. It's a
good solution.''
</P>
<P>
   For Wavepath, a 50-person firm, Sprint's purchase is a
validation of the company's technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Wavepath managed to do is prove that voice and data can
be carried at high speeds on MMDS spectrum and can be done
economically,'' said Guy Beaudry, president and CEO of Wavepath.
``This is excellent news.''
</P>
<P>
   Beaudry said there should not be any layoffs as a result of the
acquisition.

FREED SOLDIERS REJOIN FAMILIES IN GERMANY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LISA TEACHEY 
and DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDSTUHL, Germany _ Three U.S. soldiers, declared fit and
flashing grins, were reunited with their families Monday at a U.S.
Army hospital a day after their release by Yugoslavian captors.
</P>
<P>
   As their families arrived from the United States, the three men
were given clean bills of health by doctors, although testing on
two of them turned up partly healed injuries from earlier in their
monthlong captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials said the injuries could indicate mistreatment by
the Serbs who captured them near the Macedonia border with Kosovo,
but said further investigation would be needed to clarify when the
injuries occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers put that matter aside Monday, happily traipsing
onto a balcony at about 10 a.m., their families beside them, to
wave and smile at gathered reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Spc. Steven Gonzales, 22, of Huntsville, Texas, was flanked by
his parents, Rosie and Gilbert Gonzales, and his aunt, Rosalinda
Barrow. He flashed the ``thumbs-up'' sign and a grin when asked how
he felt.
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sgt. Christopher Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich., held
his 4-year-old son, Ryan. He was accompanied by his parents, James
and Edith Stone, his sisters, Deanna Stone and Dawn Reliford, and
his wife, Trisha, who has family in San Antonio, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles, stood with his
parents, Andrew and Vivian Ramirez, his brother, Steven, his
sister, Nadine, and her 6-month-old daughter, Vanessa. It was the
first time Ramirez had seen his niece.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales appeared to be in the best medical condition, said
officials at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, the largest
American medical facility outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a medical standpoint, Spc. Gonzales has no further tests
planned,'' said Col. Mack Blanton, deputy commander of clinical
services at Landstuhl. ``Everything has turned out fine as far as
initial laboratory and X-ray studies. He will not need any further
studies.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone had a scan Monday morning that revealed he had a broken
nose. Ramirez had swelling in his right lower leg and two broken
ribs, but doctors said he needed no further treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They rested very well. Woke up this morning in good spirits,
eager to be reunited with their families,'' said Lt.-Col. Sharon
DeRuvo, chief of clinical nursing at Landstuhl.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said in Washington that the
three soldiers would undergo debriefings for two or three more
days.
</P>
<P>
   The initial interviews have reaffirmed U.S. officials' belief
that the soldiers were captured inside Macedonia, Bacon said. Serb
authorities have claimed the three were in Serb territory when
captured March 31.
</P>
<P>
   After taking 30 days of leave, the soldiers will likely return
to their units, which are based in Germany, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said President Clinton would
like to meet with the three servicemen when he visits other U.S.
troops in Germany Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Family members of the soldiers began arriving in Frankfurt at
8:45 a.m. Monday (2:45 a.m. EST) and traveled by car to the medical
facility, which is located about 90 miles southwest. A major
traffic accident on the German autobahn delayed their arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales' parents and an aunt arrived at the medical center at
about noon. They visited and ate dinner with Gonzales at the
medical base.
</P>
<P>
   DeRuvo said the soldiers had been watching television, listening
to the radio and reading newspapers since arriving by air Sunday
from Croatia, where they crossed over from Serbia by bus.
</P>
<P>
   DeRuvo said the soldiers were getting reacclimated to life on
the base. Just to make sure, each was assigned a ``buddy escort''
from their unit who knew them well and who could help them adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``They worked together, they trained together, they have spent
time together,'' DeRuvo said of the buddy escorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know each other in terms of what they like and what they
don't like, so they are there to help them repatriate,'' she said.
``They are there to give them a firm grounding into what their life
is normally like and get them back into that transition into their
home environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanton said the general health of the soldiers was good.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were generally taken care of adequately during their
period of captivity,'' Blanton said. ``I have no concerns in that
regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen David Grange, commanding general of the First Infantry
Division, said, however, that he suspected the soldiers were
treated poorly when they were first captured. Grange escorted U.S.
civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and the soldiers from Croatia to
Ramstein Air Base near Landstuhl on Sunday morning. Jackson and an
ecumenical entourage are credited with negotiating the release of
the prisoners of war Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think all the treatment was well,'' Grange said,
citing how the soldiers appeared on Serb television. ``It's obvious
there was a little bit of mistreatment. But the examinations will
determine that.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone had visible injuries on his face when the three were shown
on international news broadcasts shortly after their capture.
</P>
<P>
   Blanton said it did not appear that Stone had suffered permanent
damage. Blanton declined to elaborate on how Stone was injured
because the circumstances surrounding the soldiers' capture is
being investigated. The soldiers were on a routine reconnaissance
mission on the border when captured.
</P>
<P>
   While in captivity, Ramirez received stitches for a laceration
on the top of his head, doctors said. It was not clear how that
injury occurred, but Blanton said the wound was healing well.
</P>
<P>
   DeRuvo said the soldiers' military training helped them maintain
physical strength and mental fortitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took excellent care of themselves,'' she said. ``They
were trained well. They knew what to do, and it shows that they had
the discipline to take care of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, they've come out overall in good health, but the
training the military has provided them and the discipline they
chose to take to follow that training made a difference in their
physical and mental well-being. They look good. They feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the soldiers were eager to be reunited with their
unit at Schweinfurt Army Base about 100 miles northeast of the
military hospital. But they also were looking forward to going back
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now they are looking at some well-deserved leave,''
Grange said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By ARTHUR LOUIS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
Q: In a recent column, you mentioned that when someone inherits
stock, that person's cost basis for capital gains will be the price
of the stock on the day the deceased died. Does this also hold true
for stock contained in an inherited Individual Retirement Account?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Inherited IRAs are a special case.
</P>
<P>
   The key point is that the taxable proceeds you get from an
inherited IRA are considered ordinary income, not a capital gain.
Therefore, the cost basis is irrelevant for your tax calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Internal Revenue spokesman Jesse Weller points out that IRAs are
a rare exception to the general rule that assets you inherit are
nontaxable. If the deceased were to leave you stock outright _
rather than in an IRA _ you wouldn't be taxed on the value of the
stock, although you would have to pay a capital-gains tax if the
value of the stock later rose and you sold it.
</P>
<P>
   If you inherit a traditional IRA from your spouse, you have the
choice of either removing the assets from the IRA or maintaining
the IRA as though you originated it yourself. If you choose to keep
the IRA intact, you can make your own contributions, according to
the usual rules and limitations, and you aren't compelled to
withdraw any assets until after you reach age 701/2. You won't be
taxed until the withdrawals begin.
</P>
<P>
   If you are not the spouse, you are not entitled to keep the IRA
intact. You have to take a distribution of the proceeds. With a
deductible IRA, all the proceeds are taxable. With a nondeductible
IRA, the amount that exceeds the contributions is taxable.
</P>
<P>
   (None of this discussion applies to Roth IRAs, which are tax
free.)
</P>
<P>
   When you receive the proceeds, you have the choice of either
taking the stock as stock or having it liquidated and receiving
cash instead. Either way, you pay taxes based on the value of the
stock at the time of the distribution.
</P>
<P>
   If you receive stock, any change in the value after the
distribution will be treated as a capital gain or loss. The date
you receive the stock would be the date you use in determining
whether the gain or loss is long-term or short-term.
</P>
<P>
   There are other, even more convoluted, rules about the tax
treatment of inherited IRAs that can't be covered in this space _
such as how quickly the IRA assets must be distributed and whether
you may deduct part of the estate taxes in figuring your income-tax
liability.
</P>
<P>
   For fuller details, take a look at IRS publications 590, 559 and
448.
</P>
<P>
   FINDING MISSING CASH
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a client of an online brokerage firm. On the latest
monthly account statement they sent me, a substantial amount `of
cash appeared to be missing. I called this to the attention of
three different client-support representatives, but they seemed
confused, and the situation has not been rectified. How should I
proceed?
</P>
<P>
   A: Your next step should be to contact the top management of the
brokerage firm. No more fooling with subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   If you are correct about the amount of money that should be in
your account and if you haven't been deliberately defrauded,
management probably can clear up the matter to your satisfaction by
conducting a detailed review of your transaction record.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't work, file a complaint with the National
Association of Securities Dealers, the brokerage industry's
self-regulatory body.
</P>
<P>
   You can file your complaint electronically on NASD's Web site at
www.nasdr.com. Or you can complain by letter to NASD's district
office in San Francisco. Write to the attention of Elisabeth P.
Owens, the district director, at 525 Market St., Suite 300, San
Francisco, Calif. 94105-2711. The telephone number is (415)
882-1200.
</P>
<P>
   TAKING STOCK
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have just bought some stock and want to know what is the
record date for tax purposes. Is it the date the trade actually was
made on the stock exchange, or is it the settlement date three
business days later?
</P>
<P>
   A: When you report a capital transaction on Form 1040, Schedule
D, you enter the actual transaction date _ not the settlement date
_ under the heading ``date acquired.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in the next column, under ``date sold,'' you state
the actual transaction date of the sale.
</P>
<P>
   For your sale to qualify as a long-term capital gain (or loss),
the ``date sold'' must be at least one year and one day after the
``date acquired.'' If an asset is sold one year to the day after it
is bought, it is still a short-term sale.

GIULIANI AIMS GIBES AT HILLARY CLINTON AT AN UPSTATE DINNER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton supplied Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani with some of his best material Monday night as he drew
cheers from Republicans here with jabs at her as an interloper with
no connection to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``carpetbagger'' has crept into Giuliani's speeches as
he and Mrs. Clinton crisscross the state, each exploring a run for
the same U.S. Senate seat next year, and he used it again at the
Fulton County Republican Party's annual dinner in Amsterdam, which
is 30 miles northwest of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor reminded his audience that Mrs. Clinton, who grew up
in Illinois, has lived most of her adult life in Arkansas, and
signaled that he sees resentment of her as a powerful issue for New
York Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really does make sense in New York to have somebody
representing us in the Senate, let's start off, who's from New
York,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may announce for the Senate in Arkansas,'' he joked. And in
an arch reference to that state's political scandals, he added,
``Given the experience of the last several years, maybe they would
elect me.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani gave his usual account of taming the untamable city,
cutting crime and shrinking welfare rolls, but his barbs at Mrs.
Clinton brought the most enthusiastic response from his audience of
200.
</P>
<P>
   His comments were even more pointed in a session with reporters
before the dinner, when he said that in a campaign, there would be
raised ``a very valid question of how do you represent a state in
which you have no connection at all,'' an issue that he said would
be particularly potent upstate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of her being a carpetbagger in New York City does not
have the same impact as it does outside of New York City,'' the
mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that her candidacy would be ``a real plus'' because
``she would galvanize support for the Republican side in a way that
few people could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in central New York, one of the state's most staunchly
Republican regions, that may well be true. In Fulton County, 19 of
the 20 county legislators are Republican, and the other is an
independent.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he thought of Giuliani, Allen Bohne, a former
county party chairman, said, ``I can tell you one thing, I don't
think too much of Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   Several people at Monday night's event said that they did not
know much about the mayor _ though what they knew, they said, was
positive _ and that they were reserving judgment about a possible
primary between Giuliani and Rep. Rick Lazio of Long Island's
Suffolk County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had Lazio speak to us not long ago, and we really liked
him,'' said Dexter Risedorph, a county election commissioner.
``Tell you the truth, I'll go with whoever can win.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who takes pains to appear nonpartisan at home, where
most voters are Democrats, wears his party identification far more
proudly upstate. ``The things that New York City gets credit for
turning around all have to do with Republican philosophy and
Republican programs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also took swipes at President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore, and said that any of the Republicans running for
president would be preferable to Gore. He also praised Gov. George
Pataki, a highly popular figure here but a fellow Republican with
whom Giuliani has clashed repeatedly.

WAVES OF THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After many years of straight, smooth hair, it seems
to be time for a change to styles with a bit of texture. That
should be good news for women with curls or waves or anyone whose
hair gets unruly in summer humidity.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Lawrence of Louis Licari says that cutting long layers
into hair that is no longer than shoulder-grazing will encourage
any natural curl or wave. Layers also lighten the weight of hair so
it has gentle movement. She suggests using gel or pomade and
squeezing hunks of hair to lock in the desired shape.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Tavernise of the Peter Coppola Salon describes the change
as going from the look of satiny silk to nubby linen. To achieve
the effect on naturally straight hair, he suggests applying pomade
or gel to random strips of hair, twisting each one, and letting it
sit on the hair underneath, without combing or brushing. This will
work on any length hair, he says.

PATAKI ASKS FOR EASING OF DRUG LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki proposed a plan Monday to
loosen the stringent Rockefeller-era drug laws, which have caused
New York's prison population to swell over the last two decades
with drug offenders who have been subjected to tough mandatory
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   But Pataki's aides indicated that he would agree to ease the
drug laws only if his Democratic rivals in the Legislature approved
one of his main criminal-justice initiatives of the year, the
elimination of parole. Democratic leaders in the Assembly said
Monday that they would be open to considering both proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The laws, adopted in 1973 under Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, call
for some of the toughest prison sentences in the nation for drug
offenses. They have remained in place since then, despite repeated
attempts, mostly by Democrats, to overhaul them. The critics have
charged, among other things, that the laws have clogged the state's
prisons with drug offenders, many of them nonviolent addicts, who
might be better served in drug treatment programs or other cheaper
alternatives to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Last year alone, 9,063 people were sent to state prison for drug
offenses. That brought the total number of people in state prison
for nonviolent drug crimes to about 22,000, or roughly a third of
the total state prison population of 70,000, according to the
Correctional Association of New York, a prison watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki himself expressed grave reservations about the laws when
he took office, but up to now he had done little to advance any
revisions.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's main ally in Albany, Sen. Joseph Bruno, the Republican
majority leader, warmly praised the new plan and said he would pass
it.
</P>
<P>
   Under the drug laws, judges must abide by rigid sentencing
guidelines that require long prison terms for drug offenses, even
for relatively minor ones like possessing a small quantity of
narcotics. For example, someone convicted of selling more than 2
ounces of cocaine, heroin or other controlled substances _ or
possessing more than 4 ounces _ must be sentenced to a minimum of
15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's proposal would allow appellate judges to reduce
the minimum sentence to as little as 10 years, although only in
cases involving first-time felons convicted of relatively minor
crimes, like simple possession of a small quantity of drugs above
the 4-ounce minimum. The plan would also apply to people already
convicted. His aides estimated that about 250 drug offenders
currently behind bars would be eligible to appeal their sentences
under the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The plan Pataki outlined Monday prompted frustration and
disappointment among longtime critics of the drug laws, who had
been counting on him to push for a more comprehensive change. They
said that his plan fell far short of one of their main goals: the
abandonment of the current sentencing structure for drug crimes,
along with the restoration of discretion to judges in determining
the punishment for drug offenders.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor's plan drew praise from prosecutors across the
state, who have argued against any wholesale revision in the laws,
saying that they provide a valuable tool for combating crime and
extracting plea bargains from defendants.

REED IS BACK ON BOARD AS THE METS SPIN ALONG
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Mets' season has been a little like a
revolving door so far: The moment a player comes back into view, it
seems another one is gone.
</P>
<P>
   A rash of nagging injuries since spring training has prevented
Manager Bobby Valentine from using a set lineup every day. And it
is doubtful that Valentine, who loves to tinker, would have done so
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter what lineup combination Valentine has put on the
field, the Mets have usually won.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night at Shea Stadium, in a 5-3 victory over the Houston
Astros, Rick Reed made his return from the disabled list as the
Mets (17-9) were victorious for the sixth time in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had just completed their first three-game sweep of San
Francisco at Shea Stadium in 22 years, even though the Giants had
won six in a row and had the best record in the league coming in.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros then came into town on a four-game roll, in first
place in the National League Central, and boasting the best hitting
lineup in the league.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets made it easy on Reed, who was pitching for the
first time since April 11, by giving him a 4-0 first-inning lead.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Cedeno _ playing for Rickey Henderson, out with a sprained
right knee _ ignited the rally with a single and a stolen base. One
out later, John Olerud walked. Mike Piazza followed with a
run-scoring single off Chris Holt (0-4).
</P>
<P>
   Robin Ventura singled to load the bases. Mike Kinkade _ a late
addition to the lineup in place, this time, of Bobby Bonilla _ was
hit by a pitch to drive in a run. Brian McRae followed with a
two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who allowed five hits and three runs in six innings with
two walks and six strikeouts, needed every single run. A leadoff
walk to Ken Caminiti in the second led to a two-out, run-scoring
single from Holt. Richard Hidalgo followed a two-out bloop single
from Caminiti in the sixth with his sixth home run of the year to
cut the lead to 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   But Cedeno hustled his way to a one-out double in the bottom of
sixth, stole third and scored on Edgardo Alfonzo's fly ball to
left.
</P>
<P>
   Turk Wendell tossed two scoreless innings before John Franco
came on to record his 10th save in 10 attempts. So Reed, coming
back from a torn calf muscle, went to 2-0 on the year as the Mets
continued to apply pressure to the first-place Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the Mets were without their starting outfield Monday
night. Henderson is out indefinitely with an injury he sustained
Sunday, and Bonilla, out since April 24 with a partial ligament
tear in his right knee, was scratched from the start when it rained
before the game. He wound up grounding out pinch-hitting for Reed
in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, General Manager Steve Phillips said: ``I think
we've played our full team only the first five days of the season.
That makes me hopeful that once we do get everyone back, we'll be a
pretty good team.''  &QL;

DULL SAYS HE WOULD MEND FENCES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was the most miserable time of Richard Dull's
life _ those months following the death of Maryland basketball star
Len Bias.
</P>
<P>
   Dull, the Terrapins athletic director at the time, was hounded
by reporters and wracked by guilt. Bias' death, induced by cocaine,
resulted in myriad investigations into the basketball program, all
of which embarrassed the university.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen years later, Dull sat in the Cal State Northridge
athletic department conference room and admitted his mistakes. He
is one of four finalists to become CSUN's next athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we really had done was admit student-athletes that did
not have any chances of graduating,'' Dull said. ``My role in
encouraging their admission was a mistake. . . . It is one I'm not
going to repeat here.''
</P>
<P>
   After resigning from Maryland, his alma mater, in the fall of
1986, Dull worked in the private sector until July 1995, when he
became the director of athletics at the University of Nebraska at
Kearney. He moved on to his current post as director of athletics
at Moravian College in Bethlehem, Pa., in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed the environment of college athletics,'' Dull said.
``The best time of my life was as a student-athlete at the
University of Maryland and as the athletic director at Maryland _
minus four months.''
</P>
<P>
   If hired at CSUN, Dull would be in charge of an athletic
department that needs to be rebuilt on a fundamental level. Dull
said the department is understaffed and needs to mend fences with a
faculty that feels alienated from athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to be as active in the academic community as you
can,'' he said. ``Once people start to talk to each other, they
understand each other. There has been some unhappiness on the
faculty with the (sports) administration here. You take care of
your own house first.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as marketing CSUN athletics, Dull said he would reach out
to families, even though students would not be ignored. The goal of
the department, he said, is to capture the attention of a core
group that has roots in the community.
</P>
<P>
   Dull noted that when he took over as athletic director at
Maryland in 1981, about 3,000 students attended home football
games. By the mid-'80s, when the Terrapins became a nationally
ranked program, student attendance had increased to 17,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``You build around families,'' he said. ``I'm not into
tailgaters or beer drinkers. People go to sports events to have
fun. You have to make it fun for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution to spreading the word, Dull said, isn't a mystery.
One of the jobs of the department is to speak directly to community
organizations and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is hard work,'' he said. ``There are no secret
plans out there anymore. A lot of people put ads in newspapers. I
regard that as the lazy man's way. Radio advertising, newspaper
advertising, TV advertising . . . that doesn't require much work.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Arias, the fourth and final A.D. candidate, is scheduled
for interviews and a public forum on Friday. The forum is scheduled
for 4:30-5:30 p.m. in the athletic-department conference room.
