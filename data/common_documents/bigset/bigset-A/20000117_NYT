   There is carnage in America's cinemas these days, and not all of
it is on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Having built far more cinemas in recent years than the market
can sustain, the big chains of movie theatres are leaking cash and
watching their share prices crash through the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors are now swirling around the industry that one of the
companies is likely to file for Chapter 11. And, just as films
appear in Europe some time after they open in America, so the
industry's troubles threaten to cross over too.
</P>
<P>
   All good stories have a strong theme running through them. The
moral of this one is: beware the notion that big is better.
</P>
<P>
   While the business was riding high a couple of years ago, two
sorts of big were in vogue in the business: big companies and big
theatres.
</P>
<P>
   The ordinary old cinema was superseded during the second half of
the 1970s and the 1980s by the multiplex. Then, in the early 1990s,
the megaplex arrived. &QL;

   Definitions are flexible, but multiplex tends to mean fewer than
15 screens, and mega more than 15; more importantly, however, mega
tends to have ``stadium seating'' _ arranged on steps, so the hat
in front does not obscure your view _ and digital sound.
</P>
<P>
   The theatre owners, who had been struggling to find ways to pep
up a slow business, were thrilled by the megaplex. They talk in
terms of how large an area a cinema can ``clear'' _ the radius of
the area that people will come from to your cinema to see a big
hit.
</P>
<P>
   Clearance zones have fallen from 15 miles (24 kilometers) in the
1960s to two or three miles now. But the first megaplexes, theatre
owners found, were clearing five-mile radiuses. &QL;

   It looked as though cinemas had found their salvation. In their
enthusiasm for building new megaplexes, the theatre owners were
egged on by the shopping-mall operators.
</P>
<P>
   America's malls were having a hard time, and operators decided
that they needed ``anchor'' tenants, who would lure the crowds.
Movie theatres, everybody decided, were the thing; so the chains
were bribed to build.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Wall Street got into the theatre business.
``From a strategic financial point of view,'' says Marina Jacobson,
an analyst at Bear Sterns, ``movie theatres are attractive. They
have a huge free cash flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, a buyout firm, started acquiring small
properties, and then in 1998 devised a plan with Hicks Muse Tate &AMP;
Furst to put together two of the biggest chains, Regal Cinemas and
United Artists, into one vast company.
</P>
<P>
   The United Artists deal fell through, but KKR and Hicks Muse
jointly bought Regal, stuck it together with other properties, and
created a 2,500-screen chain, making it the biggest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the buyout boys were not just acquiring a nice set of
accounts. There was a grand scheme behind these deals, too. The
financial firms reckoned that, by creating a big company, they
could reverse the traditional balance of power in movies.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Hollywood screwing a fragmented theatre business, the
opposite would happen.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work out that way. For a start, the megaplex-building
went crazy. The first megaplexes, which produced such wonderful
figures, were built in the most promising markets. After that, the
returns diminished. Yet the building went on, because everybody
wanted a megaplex in the biggest markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got 30-plexes over the street from 20-plexes,'' says
Mike Patrick, chief executive of Carmike Cinemas, based in
Columbus, Ga., which is the third-largest chain.
</P>
<P>
   There was a problem with the biggest megaplexes, too. There were
not enough movies to fill them. At any one time there are around 14
movies doing business in America. That is enough to fill a
multiplex, or a small megaplex if you stick the popular films on a
couple of screens.
</P>
<P>
   The theory was that foreign films, which have never made much
headway in America, would fill the extra screens. It hasn't
happened. Patrick thinks it was a silly idea. ``If they didn't like
it before, why would they like it now?''
</P>
<P>
   As the number of screens has rocketed, so has the debt that the
cinema chains are carrying. Capacity utilization has fallen, all
four of the publicly-quoted chains lost money in their last full
recorded year, and their share prices have crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has consolidation shifted the balance of power from
Hollywood. Cinemas are paying as much for their movies as they ever
were.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, an oversupplied market does not offer the best
conditions for testing the theory. But Chris Dixon, at Paine
Webber, maintains that the buyout firms had misunderstood the
nature of the movie market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that the balance of power would swing in the
exhibitors' favor was nonsense,'' he says. ``The exhibitor is
always at the mercy of the studio that has just released the latest
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   For the industry to start recovering, says Dixon, one of the
chains needs to go out of business, and a lot of theatres need to
be closed.
</P>
<P>
   The first of his wishes looks as though it may come true. The
second is beginning to happen, but the process will be a long one. &QL;

   Are Europe's chains getting themselves into a similar mess?
Europeans have been building nearly as fast as over the past few
years as the Americans have. But Europe is still building more of
the moderate-sized multiplexes, rather than going in for the
American-style giants. And most European countries have
proportionately fewer screens than America does.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Karsten Grummit, who runs Dodona Research, an industry
consultancy, points to some worrying signs _ even in Britain, a
relatively underscreened country. ``Nobody's losing money there,
but things are a lot tougher than they were a couple of years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Capacity utilization, as measured by tickets sold per screen, is
falling, and competing multiplexes are springing up in many cities.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's chains need to look over the pond and beware. &QL;

the moderate-sized multiplexes, rather than going in for the
American-style giants. And most European countries have
proportionately fewer screens than America does.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Karsten Grummit, who runs Dodona Research, an industry
consultancy, points to some worrying signs _ even in Britain, a
relatively underscreened country. ``Nobody's losing money there,
but things are a lot tougher than they were a couple of years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Capacity utilization, as measured by tickets sold per screen, is
falling, and competing multiplexes are springing up in many cities.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's chains need to look over the pond and beware. &QL;

 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are Anne Stephenson's  &UR; NEW &AMP; NOTABLE capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; ``YUKON ALONE'' &QL; 
 &UR; By John Balzar (Holt, $25) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New &AMP; Notable is a sucker for adventure stories, particularly _
given a certain publishing orgy of late _ any story that does not
take place on Mount Everest or involve bodies that will never be
found. We were happy to discover that the Yukon can be just as cold
as Everest and is not nearly so trendy. In fact, the sled dog race
called the Yukon Quest was established 15 years ago by traditional
mushers in answer to the increasingly chic Iditarod, which has
given rise to competitors (Balzar calls them ``big names in dog
mushing'') who dress like race-car drivers and have dog handlers in
matching uniforms. Not so the mushers of the Quest. They are an
odd, scruffy lot, and their race is an odd, lonely ordeal: 1,023
miles from Canada's Yukon Territory to Fairbanks, Alaska, in the
long darkness of February. Balzar spent months among these people
to profile the 1998 Quest for the ``Los Angeles Times.'' His book
is about a place where priorities are different and life is
demanding, and both are what you make of them. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``SUNDANCING'' &QL; 
By John Anderson (Spike, $12.50) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is a behind-the-scenes story of the Sundance Film Festival,
and it isn't pretty. It is crowded, commercial, competitive and
very, very important to the independent filmmakers who come to
Sundance like pilgrims to a glitzy, overproduced mecca of their
dreams. They come in search of success, something that became
associated with Sundance after 1989, when Steven Soderberg's film
``sex, lies and videotape'' changed the face of both the festival
and the independent film itself. Anderson, film critic for
``Newsday,'' went to Sundance last year and spent lots of time
listening to people talk about it _ everyone from actors, writers
and directors to journalists, publicists and even a police officer
who impounded Clint Eastwood's car (``He was very personable, a
very nice person to visit with. He had his picture taken with us
and seemed to be enjoying himself.''). We must make do with the
implied presence of Robert Redford, whose reticence is notorious
and who is, one director says, like a ``phantom'' at his own
festival. Not surprisingly, he and the Sundance Institute declined
to be involved with this book. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``MONSTER'' &QL; 
By Jonathan Kellerman (Random House, $25.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kellerman is a psychologist. That gives him the upper hand in
this thriller, which begins in the exercise yard of a hospital for
the criminally insane. Kellerman's recurring character, Alex
Delaware, himself a psychologist, has come with Detective Milo
Sturgis to search for clues in the brutal slaying of Dr. Claire
Argent, who worked among the strange and frightening inmates of the
hospital. These men are incarcerated for life, having killed people
for no logical reason and with particularly disgusting and
blood-splattering abandon. How then could one of them have been
involved in a murder that occurred on the outside? You begin to
suspect the answer to this question around about Page 79, but then
suspense is not the strong suit of this book. That honor belongs to
its portrayal of these seriously dangerous men, their taste for
violence and their relationships with the people who treat them.
Delaware and Sturgis discover that Argent's murder has roots in a
dreadful crime committed nearly two decades earlier. We relive
every gory detail of it and more. Enjoy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``LIFE STORIES'' &QL; 
Edited by David Remnick (Random House, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Light the candles, practice the song, the ``New Yorker'' is 75
and Remnick wants you to make a fuss. By way of encouragement, he
has edited two delectable volumes. This is a collection of
profiles, biographical pieces for which the magazine is justly
famous. Included, among others, are Lillian Ross' look at Ernest
Hemingway, Truman Capote on Marlon Brando, Roger Angell on
baseball's Steve Blass, Calvin Trillin on Edna Buchanan, Henry
Louis Gates Jr. on Anatole Broyard, A.J. Liebling on Floyd
Patterson, and Susan Orlean's hilarious profile of a show dog
called Biff Truesdale. Remnick's second offering is ``Wonderful
Town'' (Random House, $26.95), a collection of short stories set in
New York and published over the years in the ``New Yorker.'' A
partial list of contributors: Philip Roth, Woody Allen, James
Thurber, John Cheever, John O'Hara, Deborah Eisenberg, John Updike,
Dorothy Parker, William Maxwell, E.B. White, Saul Bellow, S.J.
Perelman, Vladimir Nabokov, Lorrie Moore . . . we could go on and
on. Excuse us while we locate our matches and don our paper hats. &QL;

`I'M DICK CLARK, YOU'RE DICK CLARK: SOMEONE BORN TODAY MAY LIVE TO

 CATEGORY,  with AGESIDE  sidebar)
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Many readers of this article, particularly those at midlife or
younger, probably expect to live through a good half or more of the
new century.
</P>
<P>
   What they may not be counting on, however, is the speed of
medical progress:
</P>
<P>
   Some people who are middle age today, right now, may well live
through the entire &QC; 
21st century and may be reading another article like this 100 years
from now.
</P>
<P>
   The average lifespan was 47 years when the 20th century began.
It is now 76 years, thanks to public health improvements,
antibiotics, vaccinations, heart surgery, cancer treatments and
other breakthroughs. Some scientists say the American lifespan
could double by the end of the century, thanks to fundamental
tinkering with the root causes of aging and disease.
</P>
<P>
   A world of 150-year-olds doesn't mean a world of tottering
frailty: Extended longevity will be the result of robust health,
extending well into the ninth decade of life and beyond. Retirement
will be a quaint notion, some say, as might retirement communities.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 70,000 Americans who are 100 years old or
older. That number has tripled since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   (In Arizona, there are about 500 centenarians, some keeping
schedules that would put 30-year-olds to shame _ such as former
state Rep. Polly Rosenbaum of Globe and Phoenix, who turned 100 in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Based on current medical science and not allowing for any
advances, the number of Arizonans ages 85 and older is expected to
increase to 455,831 in 2050 from 83,381 in 2000.) If this all seems
like an extended pre-death limbo that you're really not looking
forward to, be cheered by the probability that, in this coming
``I'm Dick Clark, You're Dick Clark'' era, things such as wrinkles,
gray hair, old skin, old muscles, old brain cells, old eyes, old
spouses and poor memories could be things you get fixed at the spa
with pills, creams, injections and flavored sorbets.
</P>
<P>
   Although all that may sound like science fiction, there is some
science making some of it likely.
</P>
<P>
   As a new century begins, scientists studying aging are
cautiously optimistic about making major progress soon in
addressing the cause of aging and the diseases associated with
aging. They have had astonishing success in recent years in
increasing the lifespans of laboratory species such as worms and
fruit flies. Genetic advances also offer tremendous potential.
</P>
<P>
   Although some on the fringe of the scientific world are
predicting lifespans of 200 or more within the next 50 years, most
of those doing the more serious aging research _ people who can't
afford to be quoted on the cover of the ``National Enquirer'' _
aren't saying they agree or disagree.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, however, they are beginning to say fairly amazing
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hunch is that there's a 75 percent chance that someone born
today will live to be 150,'' said Steve Austad, a University of
Idaho biologist specializing in aging and the author of ``Why We
Age.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it at a meeting of eminent academic researchers on aging
who gathered last year at the University of California School of
Medicine at Los Angeles to talk about some of the likely advances
in the next 10 to 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   And at that same meeting, the previously unspeakable was spoken:
``Over the next couple of decades, we will be able to unravel the
mechanism of aging,'' said Cynthia Kenyon, a professor of
biochemistry and biophysics at the University of California-San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that with just a few genetic alterations, scientists
have created worms and fruit flies that have lifespans twice the
norm and that die healthy and vigorous _ the worm or fly equivalent
of being 90 and looking 45. Even mice have lived 40 to 60 percent
longer than normal with a simple genetic tweak. Once more is known
about why and how we age, then the work of delaying it could begin.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INCREMENTAL INCREASES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Judith Campisi of the Berkeley National Laboratory at the
University of California-Berkeley, one of the leading experts on
cancer and aging, sees average lifespans increasing in increments,
as the diseases that kill us are eliminated. She isn't about to
predict future lifespans, however. If she underguesses, she'll live
to regret it.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't exactly throw cold water on the happy talk, however:
``I expect we will be able to ameliorate and perhaps reverse some
of the disabling conditions that plague the last decade or so of
human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Stem cell research in particular, she said, offers the potential
replenishment of cells lost due to aging, trauma or disease.
</P>
<P>
   Most age researchers are more excited about quality of life than
quantity of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What many people don't realize is that we are talking about
having 90-year-olds who are as functional as 50-year-olds,'' said
Kenyon, of UCSF.
</P>
<P>
   Quality of life may be safer to talk about because the culture
may not be ready for the idea of more of us living to 120 or
beyond. When Judith Campisi explained to a group in San Francisco
that her aging research could dramatically extend the lives of
people, the problem of overpopulation came up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception that what we are doing is bad for all humankind
can't be ignored,'' she worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is huge hypocrisy around this issue,'' said Steve Austad
of the University of Idaho. ``Some of the same people who respond
that too many people will live too long are lined up at the drug
counters buying melatonin and other supplements purported to have
anti-aging powers.''  &QL; 
ETHICS OF AGING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Arnold, director of the gerontology program at Arizona
State University, worries that without thoughtful discussions now,
only the rich will be able to benefit from some of the scientific
advances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethics will become a major point of discussion where science,
medicine, economics and aging interface,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most agree that major health-policy decisions need to be made
before some of the stem-cell treatments are ready for the market,
which may not be too far off.
</P>
<P>
   For a price, injections will be able to rejuvenate joints,
muscles, organs, skin, even brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, the biggest challenges facing aging America will
be psychological,'' said Ken Dychtwald, a psychologist and author
of the new book ``Age Power.'' ``America has always considered
itself a young nation, a new society _ not an old one.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dychtwald predicts that it will happen: ``We are the
beneficiaries of a Wild West of organ cloning, cyborg body parts,
nutricuticles and biotech manipulations of the biological clock to
the extraordinary extent that some baby boomers will live well past
100 with the look and feel of 50 and 60-year-olds.'' &QL;

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
INDIANAPOLIS _ For the first time since the Luv Ya Blue era, when
they were known as the Houston Oilers, the Tennessee Titans are
playing in the AFC Championship Game.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rather than Bum Phillips and Earl Campbell knocking on the Super
Bowl door in Pittsburgh, it will be Jeff Fisher and Eddie George
trying to kick the SOB in at Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the best and most satisfying playoff games in the
franchise's 40-year history, the Titans stunned the Indianapolis
Colts 19-16 in an AFC divisional game Sunday, setting up the AFC
Championship Game at Jacksonville on Jan. 23.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars, who annihilated Miami 62-7 on Saturday, have a 15-2
record, with the only blemishes 20-19 and 41-14 losses to
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this game was a nuclear holocaust, that one's going to be
World War III,'' offensive tackle Brad Hopkins said after helping
the Titans rush for 197 yards.
</P>
<P>
   If the Titans can record a hat trick against the Jaguars, they
will be headed for Super Bowl XXXIV at the Georgia Dome against the
winner of the Tampa Bay-St. Louis NFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope everything keeps going our way until Jan. 30 when we're
holding up the Vince Lombardi Trophy,'' Titans receiver Kevin Dyson
said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Titans were the Oilers, guard Bruce Matthews made the
playoffs seven consecutive years but never advanced beyond the
second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, I've watched a lot of second-round games like
this, and I've told myself it wasn't that big a deal to win them.
But I was wrong,'' Matthews said. ``This is a big deal, and I feel
blessed to finally be part of something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The underdog Titans upset the Colts with a throwback game plan
right out of the Phillips playbook.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, it was Eddie George right, Eddie George left and
Eddie George up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   George carried 26 times for 162 yards and scored Tennessee's
only touchdown on a team playoff-record 68-yard run on the first
series of the third quarter that gave the Titans a 13-9 lead they
never surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the game, I pulled Eddie aside and told him that in
April of 1996 we drafted him in the first round to win games like
this,'' Fisher said. ``It's taken us awhile to get here, but this
is exactly the way we wanted to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   George broke Campbell's single-game franchise playoff record of
118 yards with his prodigious performance. And he did something
else Campbell was never able to do when he became the franchise's
first player to post back-to-back 100-yard rushing games in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie ran hard all day,'' Titans quarterback Steve McNair
said. ``In a playoff game like this, there ae going to be one or
two big plays that make a difference. His run was the only big play
we had on offense, but it was good enough to stand up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indianapolis defense wasn't exactly the Steel Curtain.
Entering Sunday's game, the Colts had allowed an average of 141
yards rushing and 4.8 per carry over the previous three games, and
the interior defense had been marshmallow soft.
</P>
<P>
   Titans offensive coordinator Les Steckel called plays that
attacked the Colts' weakness. McNair crossed up the Colts with his
running ability, carrying seven times for 35 yards.
</P>
<P>
   After a slow start passing, McNair finished 13-of-24 for 112
yards. He didn't throw a touchdown pass, but he also wasn't sacked
and didn't throw an interception.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans played smart but relentless defense designed to
attack and contain the Colts' magnificent threesome of quarterback
Peyton Manning, running back Edgerrin James and receiver Marvin
Harrison. Defensive coordinator Gregg Williams devised an
aggressive plan that put eight players in the box and called for 95
percent man coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Manning completed 19 of 43 passes for 227 yards. Like McNair, he
didn't throw a touchdown pass and wasn't sacked or intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   James, the outstanding two-way threat who became the first
rookie to lead the NFL in rushing since Eric Dickerson in 1983,
carried 20 times for 56 yards, a 2.8-yard average.
</P>
<P>
   Titans cornerback Samari Rolle covered Harrison like a bad case
of poison ivy, limiting the Pro Bowl receiver to five catches for
65 yards and harassing him into three dropped passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second half, we made some adjustments and put Samari
exclusively on Harrison,'' Williams said. ``Samari did a fantastic
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We brought (rookie cornerback) Donald Mitchell off the bench
to cover the other receiver. Because Donald played so well, it
allowed Samari to shadow Harrison everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colts finished with 305 yards to the Titans' 309. Because it
was an old-fashioned defensive struggle, the game featured an
exchange of field goals between Tennessee's Al Del Greco and
Indianapolis' Mike Vanderjagt.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderjagt gave the Colts leads of 3-0, 6-3 and 9-6 with field
goals of 40, 40 and 34 yards. Del Greco countered with 49- and
37-yarders that left the Titans behind 9-6 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   George began the second half with his 68-yard run up the middle
on which he received awesome blocks, made two cuts and outran the
Colts' secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just don't realize how powerful Eddie is,'' Titans
linebacker Barron Wortham said. ``And they misjudged his speed.
Because he's so strong, they underestimate his breakaway speed. If
they think a safety's going to chase him down, they're wrong. You
saw a good example of that today.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, good fortune smiled on the Titans. With
Tennessee leading 16-9, Colts rookie Gerald Wilkins had what
appeared to be an 87-yard punt return to the Tennessee three-yard
line. It was challenged by Fisher, reviewed and overturned by
referee John Grier, who ruled Wilkins had stepped out of bounds at
his 34.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a huge swing,'' said Indianapolis coach Jim Mora,
whose playoff record with the Colts and Saints dropped to 0-5,
including 0-4 at home. ``To have the ball at the three-yard line
and have to move back to the 34 hurt our momentum. Our coaches felt
the call was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Greco kicked a 43-yard field goal to give the Titans a 19-9
edge with 4:19 remaining. It wasn't a commanding lead, but it
should have been comfortable. The Titans, however, just had to make
it interesting.
</P>
<P>
   George committed the game's only turnover when he lost a fumble
at the Indianapolis 39 with 3:11 remaining. The Colts took
advantage when Manning scored their only touchdown on a 15-yard run
with 1:51 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Once receiver Yancey Thigpen recovered the onside kick and
survived a vicious hit to keep possession of the ball, the Titans
eliminated the suspense by running out the clock.

OWNERS FIGHT FOR FUNDS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Since the Northridge Earthquake hit -- six years
ago today -- Walter and Bobbie Morosco have had to camp behind
their severely damaged home while battling with their insurance
company.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Wood, 79, is pursuing additions to her
earthquake-related insurance claim while living out of boxes in her
damaged home.
</P>
<P>
   And Linda Allison has to sleep in her house without hot water,
central heat and with rodent infestations, also because of
contentious insurance negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   While the quake is just a memory for most people, these three
are among hundreds of area homeowners who six years after the
Northridge temblor still reel from financial and deep emotional
aftershocks as they battle with their insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only a fraction of the person I used to be,'' said
Allison, who is battling Allstate insurance for more than $749,000
for repairs on her Northridge home, guest house and workshop plus
living expenses, and pain and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lost custody of my kids over this, and I'm constantly
putting out fires to hang on to a thread. I feel like I'm
physically killing myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance carriers have paid out more than $12.5 billion in
630,000 claims related to the Northridge Earthquake, according to
the California Department of Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at least 475 cases remain open between Allstate and 20th
Century Insurance, and there are certainly more out there among
other companies, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Allstate spokesman Peter Debreceny said the Moroscos and Allison
are in the vast minority of Allstate insurance customers hit by the
quake. Less than 1 percent of the company's 47,000 Northridge
Earthquake cases remain open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We endeavor to understand what our claimants go through, and
we learned some lessons after the quake,'' Debreceny said. ``We
take pride in the work we did, and we've gotten as many folks back
to normal life as possible. Our customers are our No. 1 concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments mean little to those with outstanding claims,
however.
</P>
<P>
   They consider themselves the ``walking wounded'' -- prisoners of
a war that has left them living like transients in homes still
marred with foundation cracks, structural damage and leaky roofs --
a breeding ground for termites and rats.
</P>
<P>
   The Moroscos know that pain and suffering perhaps deeper than
most. Their family life has remained in turmoil as their ``bad
faith'' lawsuit against Allstate remains tied up in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allstate's bad faith tactics have placed us in the worst of
dire circumstances,'' Walt Morosco said, breaking into tears
recalling the death of his father in a nursing home because he
wasn't able to care for him in the damaged house.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was our most grievous loss. Allstate has revoked our
human rights, our liberty has been marginalized and our lives
diminished so greatly that it has challenged our health,'' Morosco
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Moroscos' contentious lawsuit with Allstate has left them
with no money to repair their Simi Valley home. The company paid
them $118,000 initially to cover some repairs and living expenses,
but when they discovered extensive asbestos contamination, Allstate
repeatedly delayed examinations and challenged their claim, Morosco
said.
</P>
<P>
   He used $45,000 to have the carpet, walls and ceilings stripped
to remove the asbestos. But the home still has no sinks, air
conditioner, heater, plumbing or toilets, and structural damage
still needs to be repaired.
</P>
<P>
   They have no more money.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a pending lawsuit seeking $2 million from the
insurance behemoth. To date the case remains on its seventh
continuance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought the best policy money could buy,'' Morosco said.
``But they are serving their own bottom lines regardless of any
consideration toward ethics, morals, existing state laws and
business codes.''
</P>
<P>
   Debreceny said the Moroscos' case is among their company's 400
remaining open cases out of the original 47,000. Those cases have
been tied up for a number of reasons, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unfortunate truth that people have found additional
damage, some have simply remained open and others just have not
been able to reach agreements,'' Debreceny said. ``It's important
to us to get these people back to normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Carl Schiff, a volunteer with Community Assisted
Recovery, which was established after the quake to help homeowners
recoup losses, said the Moroscos' case is typical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adjusters walked around and noted just $20,000 to $30,000
in cosmetic damage, and never told homeowners they should have
engineers check. They never looked in the attic. They didn't look
for damage,'' Schiff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many people out there who accepted their initial
claim that have no idea of the underlying damage, what's going to
happen in the next quake,'' Schiff said.
</P>
<P>
   Wood was given living expenses from 20th Century Insurance and
provided a contractor who she said performed $100,000 in repairs to
her Woodland Hills home.
</P>
<P>
   But in the months that followed she noticed her home was much
hotter and colder than it used to be. Her roof was far inferior to
the original. And she was having termite infestations caused by
water running off the roof, seeping into foundation cracks and
dampening the wood substructure.
</P>
<P>
   She hired a private engineer who found severe damage to the
structure, the attic, the foundation, and possibly even to the soil
around her hillside home, Wood said. The 20th Century engineer did
not find these problems, and Wood questions whether he even looked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't even want to go under the house when he came,'' Wood
said.
</P>
<P>
   She has been pursuing additions to her original claim and hopes
to receive about $300,000 more from 20th Century to sell the home
and move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm living out of boxes -- I'm camping -- in my own home
because I can't unpack. Engineers would have a hard time finding
the damage if I did,'' Wood said, adding that her possessions have
been in storage almost six years. ``I just want them to pay me the
damage that I've lost, then I want to sell and forget this house.''
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Vice President of Corporate Relations Rick Hill
said he did not know the specifics of Wood's case, but said there
are about 50 cases including Wood's where they are reviewing the
claims and negotiating additional damages. An additional 25 cases
have remained in mediation or litigation and have not been settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We relate to the pain these people are going through, but in
many of them there are disagreements over the damage, and even the
experts hired by us and the homeowner disagree,'' Hill said.
``We're going to resort to third party intervention if that's what
is necessary. We're in the business of attracting customers, not
avoiding them.''

TITANS JUST PLAIN BETTER THAN COLTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Tricky devils, these Tennessee Titans. Last week
they pulled a playoff victory out of their helmets _ and out of the
Buffalo Bills' hearts. Sunday _ presto! _ they made the most
dynamic offense in the AFC disappear, vaporizing the far more
celebrated Indianapolis Colts, 19-16, in the process.
</P>
<P>
   In the den of din known as the RCA Dome _ shaking with 57,097
fans savoring the first postseason football game ever in Indiana _
the Titans' defense blunted Peyton Manning, Edgerrin James, and
Marvin Harrison, who had pulled off the statistical trifecta of
being the first teammates ever to lead the AFC in yards passing,
running, and receiving, respectively, since the AFL-NFL merger of
1970.
</P>
<P>
   And they made one thunderbolt _ Eddie George's 68-yard touchdown
blast up the middle on the third play of the second half, which
produced a 13-9 Titans lead and silence in the building _ stand up.
It rendered Manning's 15-yard scoring scramble with 1:51 left in
the game moot _ especially after Tennessee recovered the ensuing
onside kick _ and set up a visit to Jacksonville next Sunday for
the AFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   Win that and the Titans (nee Houston Oilers) will become the
last of the AFL originals from 1960 to qualify for the Super Bowl.
And the omens are good. While the Jaguars own the best record in
the NFL _ 14-2, not counting Saturday's 62-7 Jimmy Johnson
retirement party against Miami _ the Titans have dealt their
Central Division superiors their only two losses, 20-19 Sept. 26
and 41-14 Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means absolutely nothing,'' cautioned Titans coach Jeff
Fisher, who isn't interested in portents and spells even though
there seems to be something mystical about this team that compiled
a gaudy, if hardly overwhelming, 13-3 record during the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   Even after last week's improbable climax, the kickoff touchdown
lateral that stole survival from the Bills, 22-16, Fisher is not
acknowledging any celestial forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not destiny,'' he said. ``It's called winning games.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning them a certain way, to be precise. A way that would make
connoisseurs of the sport cover their eyes, truth be told.
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday was vintage Titans football.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won it our way,'' said Fisher. ``It wasn't pretty, but you
look up at the end and we're up by 3. That's our way.''
</P>
<P>
   That's about as much as can be expected from an offense that
springs from the fertile imagination of coordinator Les Steckel,
the former Patriots assistant who surely wore a pocket protector
every day in class before he became a Marine. Steckel's idea of an
attack is George, George, and more George, with a little Steve
McNair play action thrown in when he wants to get funky. And son of
a gun if it didn't work against the Colts _ who became the third
and last member of the vaunted AFC East in two weeks to fall to the
supposedly weak sisters of the Central.
</P>
<P>
   George, the 6-foot-3-inch, 240-pound ramrod who may be the most
anonymous Heisman Trophy standout in history _ he's gained at least
1,000 yards in each of his four NFL seasons, with hardly a notice _
gouged out 162 yards on 26 carries, setting a franchise playoff
record and becoming the first Oiler/Titan to run for at least 100
yards in consecutive postseason games.
</P>
<P>
   His third-quarter romp put an end to what had been a glorified
tabletop football game, complete with triangular paper and
outstretched arms and forefingers for goalposts. The first half
consisted entirely of field goals _ three by NFL scoring champion
Mike Vanderjagt (40, 40, and 34 yards) and two by the Titans'
venerable Al Del Greco (49, 37).
</P>
<P>
   But in the locker room at halftime, the Titans prepared to
spring George.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a counter,'' he said. ``We hadn't run one all game. We
decided to run it at the half. It was the first chance we had to
run one with (fullback) Lorenzo Neal in there. I saw the middle
open and I just took off.''
</P>
<P>
   With an array of Colts in futile pursuit. So unaccustomed is
George to such freedom _ such blissful lack of pounding and
thrashing _ that he took a look up at the scoreboard above the end
zone just to see if he really was that clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never done that before,'' he said sheepishly. ``I've
never had the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   He finally was caught by defensive back Tyrone Poole, but only
for a brief ride in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Del Greco added fourth-quarter field goals of 25 and 43 yards to
make it 19-9, but the Colts were as good as cooked after George's
gallop, yet another franchise playoff record.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Titan defense put the clamps on
Indianapolis's prolific troika. James, the first rookie to lead the
NFL in rushing since Eric Dickerson in 1983, was stuffed for 56
yards on 20 carries. Harrison was limited to five inconsequential
catches for 65 yards. And Manning was a mere 19 of 43 for 227
yards.
</P>
<P>
   The key ingredient was putting the shackles on James, which the
Titans did by using a defensive back _ Donald Mitchell _ rather
than a linebacker to shadow him on third down.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gave us the matchup we wanted,'' said Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt the play pass wouldn't be a problem if we stopped the
run,'' said safety Blaine Bishop. ``We stopped Edgerrin and they
had to get away from that.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Colts were left with nothing but grudging admiration.
``We never put the ball and drive together,'' said Manning. ``We
got stopped on third and 1. It was just that kind of day until very
late in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Titans weren't averse to a little intervention.
</P>
<P>
   With 9:25 left in the game and the Titans ahead, 16-9, Indy's
Terrence Wilkins fielded a Craig Hentrich punt at his 11 and
zigzagged along the right side for 87 yards to the Tennessee 3,
electrifying the crowd and setting up the Colts for the tying
score.
</P>
<P>
   Uh, not so fast.
</P>
<P>
   Titans strength and conditioning coach Steve Watterson spotted
Wilkins stepping ever so slightly out of bounds at the Colt 33. The
assistants in the press box confirmed this, but the Colts were
about to run a play, which would have precluded any challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``My pager wasn't working,'' said Fisher, ``so I had to burn a
timeout to get the replay.'' Which upheld the Titans and set the
Colts back on their heels for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a huge swing,'' sighed Indianapolis coach Jim Mora.
``What else can you say? Our coaches felt the call was right that
he stepped out of bounds. There is nothing we could do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Or anything else these Kismet Titans tried.

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
INDIANAPOLIS _ They come at you with all the subtlety of a road
grader and have about as many clever, unexpected moves.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the Titans got here with the niftiest bit of
great-escape chicanery this side of Houdini. Because the truth is
there is nothing tricky about them.
</P>
<P>
   In a bakery, they'd be white bread. In an ice cream parlor,
they'd be vanilla. In a presidential race, they'd even make fellow
Tennessean Al Gore look like the lampshade-wearing life of the
party.
</P>
<P>
   They are so much less than Elvis with swiveling hips and so much
more than the Queen Mother in support hose and a pillbox hat.
</P>
<P>
   Boring. As in reading the phone book.
</P>
<P>
   Boring. As in a giant drill bit that ground out a huge hole
straight through the middle of the Indianapolis Colts for Sunday's
19-16 win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our game,'' said head coach/art critic Jeff Fisher, ``is not
pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   In dating parlance, the Titans are coyote ugly, if you'll pardon
an old expression. A real two-bagger, for sure.
</P>
<P>
   In strictly football terms, they might now be the team to beat
on the road to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind those fancy-boy St. Louis Rams and their laser-guided
missiles, the Tampa Bay Bucs and their rookie quarterback or even
the Jacksonville Jaguars and their league-best-but-marshmallow-soft
15-2 record.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a team left standing in the NFL playoffs that is
truly worthy of wrapping its mitts around the Lombardi Trophy and
the no-nonsense man for whom it is named, it is these smash-mouth
Titans.
</P>
<P>
   They run the ball down your throat on offense and then squeeze
your windpipe on defense until you can no longer breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, the Colts were billed as the next great thing. But on
Sunday, they were only the next-best team on the field at the RCA
Dome.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive combination of Peyton Manning, Edgerrin James and
Marvin Harrison was supposed to usher the AFC side of the playoff
draw into the 21st century with their Star Wars attack. Instead, we
watched the Titans roll across the screen like an old Wagon Train
rerun, moving relentlessly, unstoppably along.
</P>
<P>
   The only bit of real drama came when the Colts' Terrence Wilkins
raced 87 yards with a punt return to the Titans' three-yard line
with just over nine minutes left. Call it payback for Mike Renfro,
but suddenly instant replay is this snakebitten franchise's best
friend. The previous weekend, ``Home run throwback'' was upheld,
and this time the replay showed Wilkins stepping out of bounds at
his 34.
</P>
<P>
   The throttling of the Colts' offense was accomplished by the
daring and simple notion of usually putting eight men on the line
of scrimmage to stop James on the run, while counting on the
cornerbacks to keep Indy's wide receivers from getting to the
outside for catches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not afraid to play on the edge,'' said Titans defensive
coordinator Gregg Williams. ``All year long, they've been eating up
the zone defenses that most teams use against them. Other teams are
afraid to play eight-man fronts against them. But we knew if we
could play man, we could take them out of their play-action passing
game. We were ready to line up.''
</P>
<P>
   They lined Manning up against the wall and shut him down to a
season-worst 19-for-43 passing for 227 yards. They limited Harrison
to five catches for 65 yards and, most important, kept the cork in
James' bottle, giving up just 56 yards on 20 carries.
</P>
<P>
   One wouldn't describe the Titans' offense as explosive so much
as exhaustive. And exhausting. From Eddie George's franchise
playoff-record 162 yards rushing on 26 carries _ including a
third-quarter burst up the middle for a 68-yard touchdown _ to key
catches by Yancey Thigpen, Frank Wycheck and Chris Sanders,
Tennessee's offense is about as exciting and yet as full of answers
as an encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there is quarterback Steve McNair, whose
pedestrian 13-for-24, 112-yard passing numbers belie his ability to
keep opposing defenses holding their breath as if walking a
tightrope. He is the dash of hot sauce that keeps you guessing
while George pours oatmeal down your throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 10 minutes before we went out for warm-ups, Jeff pulled
me aside and asked me to relive draft day back in 1996,'' George
said. ``He told me to remember why he drafted me, and that was
because he thought I could lead this team to the brink of where we
are now. He challenged me to live up to those expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Now they are all living up. Doing it their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never pretty,'' said Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Just pretty damn good.

WARNER, ST. LOUIS PROVE THEY'RE FOR REAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ They are confident, cocky, and brash, quarterback
Kurt Warner defining the attitude of all these Rams when asked
about Minnesota tough guy John Randle. ``He never showed up the
whole game,'' said Warner of the Vikings defensive lineman. ``He
was shouting out all these things to me, but I wasn't listening.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis was unveiled to all of football America for the first
time Sunday and the 49 points the Rams piled up on the Vikings in
an NFC playoff game, won by St. Louis, 49-37, came so easily. The
Rams will meet Tampa Bay for the NFC title Sunday here in the
raucous TWA Dome and, for those fans of deja vu all over again, the
Rams made their only Super Bowl appearance in 1980 after defeating
Tampa Bay, 9-0, in the NFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   The 49 points were huge but only counted for so much. It was the
Rams' attitude that was as impressive as their offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we ought to win and we thought we were going to
win,'' said Rams coach Dick Vermeil, ``and I think we painted a
glaring picture that we don't have any glaring weaknesses on
offense, on defense, and special teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, added Vermeil: ``I don't think we've played our best game
yet.'' Or, as St. Louis wide receiver Isaac Bruce put it: ``I think
we finally smashed that question of us not playing anybody.''
Quickly, too.
</P>
<P>
   On St. Louis's first play, the Rams called for a slant to Bruce
that offensive coordinator Mike Martz had noticed Dallas had used
successfully against the Vikings. Martz and Vermeil talked it over
and then gave the word to Warner, the Rams QB making his most
important start since his Iowa Barnstormers lost to the Tampa Bay
Storm in Arena Bowl X 3 1/2 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Warner thought about the play much of Saturday night, ``going
over every scenario in my head of everything we could do on the
play,'' he said. ``And we couldn't wait to get out there and run
it.'' Warner dropped back from his 23 and hit Bruce on the run for
what would turn into a 77-yard scoring pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed,'' said Vikings cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock on what makes
this St. Louis offense so lethal. ``All their receivers are quick.
Isaac made the big reception on the game's first play and then we
couldn't tackle Marshall (Faulk, on a 41-yard screen pass for a TD)
on the second series of the first quarter. After that, it was a
circus act.''
</P>
<P>
   And Warner (27 for 33 for 391 yards, 5 TDs, and 1 INT) was the
ringmaster. The five TDs? ``Just an average Arena League game,'' he
sniffed, ``but I'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   A Warner interception and a Faulk fumble in the second quarter
enabled the Vikings to take the 17-14 lead at the half. But when
Vermeil gathered his troops at halftime, he told them not to worry,
``that we had taken the Vikings' best shots and we were down only
by 3.'' Faulk remembered Vermeil saying, `` `Hey, we're stopping
ourselves. Point blank. That's it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And then, the Rams' Tony Horne immediately turned the game on
its head by returning the second-half kickoff 95 yards for a TD.
``We had things going our way until the second-half kickoff,'' said
Minnesota linebacker Dwayne Rudd. ``That was a championship play
that helped them get to a championship game.''
</P>
<P>
   The 37 points the Vikings scored might suggest St. Louis had
little or no success stopping Jeff George, Randy Moss, Cris Carter,
and Jake Reed. In truth, though, St. Louis was superlative on
defense in the third quarter, holding the Vikings to no first downs
and minus-2 yards of offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know you're not going to stop Randy Moss and Jeff George
all that time . . . you just can't do it,'' said St. Louis
cornerback Todd Lyght. ``But in that third quarter we really
stepped it up and held them; that was some of the best football
we've played all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in this matchup of two explosive offenses, the offense
that could not score when it had the ball would cost its team
dearly. And when the Vikings could not get even a first down on its
four possessions of the third quarter, the price Minnesota paid was
huge.
</P>
<P>
   After Horne's TD return, Faulk capped off a 51-yard drive with a
1-yard run and Warner hit tight end Jeff Robinson on a 13-yard TD
pass. Finally, after the Rams recovered a George fumble on the
next-to-last play of the third quarter, Warner needed only four
plays to move 23 yards, the last play a 1-yard flip to center Ryan
Tucker, who had lined up at tight end for the play, totally fooling
the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis was ahead, 42-17, and the game was over. What followed
was protracted garbage time that did little but make the final
score respectable ``and delay cocktail hour'' as Vermeil put it.
</P>
<P>
   But no score of 49-37 should hide the clear facts that the Rams
are a team built for Astroturf, faster and quicker than virtually
all the teams in the league, with one of the NFL's most accurate
passers at QB and an offensive coordinator who might try anything.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, the attitude, too. That nobody can beat the Rams.

US BATTLES IRAN TO DRAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Score one for soccer diplomacy. The US
national team was hoping for revenge, or at least to regain some
self-respect against the Islamic Republic of Iran. Instead the US
settled for a 1-1 tie Sunday, an improvement on its poor
performance at the France '98 World Cup but much less impressive
than some of its 1999 results.
</P>
<P>
   Though this was a home match for the US, the game was conducted
in a surreal atmosphere of 50,181 spectators, nearly all of them
Iranian supporters who turned the day into a celebration. There was
little of the politically fueled tension that had marked Iran's 2-1
win over the US in Lyons, France, June 21, 1998, as much of the
tension had been dissipated by distance, time, and the openness of
the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   And the US presented a much different group of players. The team
performed as the home team should _ attacking and probing against
Iran's packed defense. The US maintained its composure after
falling behind to a ninth-minute goal by Mehdi Mahdavikia, then
adjusted its scheme to stifle strikers Khodadad Azizi and Ali Daei
and rallied to control the action in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Armas scored in the third minute of the second and nearly
broke the tie midway through the half, both times off feeds from
Cobi Jones. Armas proved to be vital in keeping the US organized in
support of Claudio Reyna in midfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not as fit as we need to be, and we had problems early
because we did not do a good job with Azizi,'' US coach Bruce Arena
said. ``Azizi was able to get his fair share of balls and run at us
and split the defense. But we played quite well the last 65
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't concern myself with the politics involved in the
matchup. We were excited to play a good football-playing country
and excited to start the year. The stadium was close to full, the
game was on TV, and we played good soccer. So it was a good day for
soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran used the same counter-attacking tactics that functioned so
well in Lyons. The Iranians absorbed early US thrusts, including an
impressive looping shot off the far post by Jones in the second
minute. And they took command with their quickness and opportunism.
</P>
<P>
   Azizi set up the goal by winning a throw-in after breaking free
on the right. Azizi then took the throw-in and dribbled through the
defense into the penalty area. He left the ball for Mahdavikia, who
had scored Iran's second goal in Lyons, and Mahdavikia slotted a
shot past goalkeeper Brad Friedel.
</P>
<P>
   Azizi, 30, who plays for FC Cologne in Germany, had a breakaway
off a pass from Esmaeil Halili but sent a low shot off the right
post in the 21st minute.
</P>
<P>
   But Iran showed vulnerabilities. Goalkeeper Hadi Tabatabei, 24,
displayed excellent athleticism but struggled with positioning. And
this was nearly a fatal flaw as the Iranians retreated into a
well-organized defensive posture.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the US players from France '98 remained for this match.
And though the US seemed rejuvenated with a youthful team, it was
lacking the unpredictability of some veterans and the long-distance
threat of Preki.
</P>
<P>
   Central defenders Marcelo Balboa and Carlos Llamosa struggled
early, but their aggressive and poised play against Azizi and Daei
made the difference in the second half. This was an encouraging
sign, since both are likely to remain backups when Robin Fraser
(broken collarbone) and Eddie Pope (wedding) return.
</P>
<P>
   The US has an 8-4-3 record since Arena replaced Steve Sampson,
and it has a chance to capture imaginations during World Cup
qualifying, beginning later this year. The lack of US support was a
commentary both on the team's history of failures and on the
extraordinary number of Iranian immigrants in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do anything about what happened in France,'' US
striker Brian McBride said. ``We are concentrating on what this
team is able to do. We have to show progress, and after the first
minutes I'm happy with the way we came back.''

AN OPEN QUESTION FOR PATRIOTS BRASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ What was learned Sunday in the Trans World Dome is
that there is Patriot football and then there is pro football.
</P>
<P>
   During the St. Louis Rams' 49-37 victory over the Minnesota
Vikings in the NFC playoffs, more receivers were open in 30 minutes
than had been open in New England in 30 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A reserve center, Ryan Tucker, was more open in the end zone for
the Rams on one play than Terry Glenn was for the Patriots all
season. Plus he caught the ball when it was thrown to him there.
</P>
<P>
   What was apparent was that in St. Louis they play offense. In
New England, they play offense and then they punt.
</P>
<P>
   There could be no more stark contrast to the way it is among the
NFL's elite teams and the way it is in Foxborough than to have
watched the Rams offense dismantle the Vikings, a team that had won
nine of its last 11 by scoring points themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For a time the Vikings continued to do that, even taking a 17-14
halftime lead and piling up 476 total yards on the day, but the
Rams were relentless. Relentless with their speed, relentless with
their attack mentality, relentless with a slant pattern that has
been extinct in New England for years. Relentless with formations
and schemes that baffled the Vikings, relentless with talent
imported to St. Louis by a man the Patriots braintrust drove out of
town, personnel director Charley Armey.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, Kurt Warner, the Rams' Cinderella quarterback, had
thrown for 391 yards and five touchdowns while being sacked only
twice and touched not much more than that despite passing 33 times.
Drew Bledsoe is hit more often than that lining up for the national
anthem.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, Rams wide receiver Isaac Bruce was averaging 33.3
yards a catch and seven receivers were averaging 10 yards per
reception or better because they were running routes that got them
open rather than merely getting them 25 yards downfield.
</P>
<P>
   In one afternoon, two veteran Patriot watchers had seen more
open receivers in St. Louis than they'd seen in one season in
Foxborough. After watching New England's offense slog along as if
its feet were in cement, you watched the Rams and it reaffirmed
what you already knew.
</P>
<P>
   They are special.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are not.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams have speed on offense and speed on defense. They have a
blend of youth and experience. They have reliable if unheralded
veterans like linebacker Todd Collins and defensive tackle Ray
Agnew. (Why can't the Patriots get guys like that?) They have real
talent, not occasional talent. All-day talent, not off-and-on
talent.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, they have an offensive line that protects its
quarterback and an offensive plan that protects him, too. Only once
all day did a Rams receiver have to slow down or break stride or
reach back to grab a ball. Only once were Warner's throws not on
the money, which is why the Rams are on their way to the NFC
Championship Game Sunday against a Tampa Bay team that is going to
get pulverized regardless of how good its defense is because it
won't score 10 points on St. Louis's speed defense and eventually
the Rams' speed offense will score many more than that.
</P>
<P>
   The architect of much of this is Mike Martz, the Rams'
first-year offensive coordinator who is on every team's short list
as a head coaching candidate, including New England's. Teams win,
coordinators get the credit, and soon they become head coaches
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   A few are successful. Others are not. The rest are like Pete
Carroll. Mediocre not because of a lack of football knowledge but
because they couldn't handle the other demands of the job.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows where Martz fits into this, but he knows where his
offensive scheme fits into it and why it's working here when it
didn't work half as well in Washington and even less so in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talent,'' Martz said. ``It's easy when you have people like we
have to put this together. This whole system is like Norv's
(Turner) in Washington and Ernie's (Zampese) in New England. But
this whole system takes a different look with the people we have.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept and approach are similar to Washington but we're
just a little more liberal with what we do. It's really the same
system in New England.'' It is?
</P>
<P>
   Then why were so many receivers standing wide open in St. Louis
after being so tightly bound in New England? And why was Warner
able to so often rifle them the ball with perfect accuracy, while
Bledsoe's passes were so often going in the wrong direction?
</P>
<P>
   This could not be the same system because when they ran it in
New England nobody ran into the end zone. They ran into the
showers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The approach we take and the routes we run and the positioning
of our receivers are all similar to Don Coryell's offense (which is
the father of the Zampese-Turner-Martz system),'' Martz explained
Sunday to an incredulous questioner from the East. ``We run our
routes and we expect to complete them with this kind of talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the situation in New England, but I'd guess the
problem is probably the offensive line. It's hard for me to think
of a better line than ours. Our perimeter people get a lot of
credit but our quarterback is well-protected. I imagine that has a
lot to do with the problems back there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole approach is to go as fast as we can and pressure
them. At times you can't do that, but the last thing we want to be
is afraid. We have so much speed here. People talk about our game
plans, and we work hard at them, but it's the players first and
foremost.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get in position to make plays. If you don't have good
players, you can get them in position but they still don't make the
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   They made plays Sunday in St. Louis running Ernie Zampese's
system. They didn't make them the last two months in New England
running Mike Martz's. You figure out why.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone watched the Rams' offense destroy the Vikings and
didn't believe they were watching a different brand of football
than they saw in New England all year they were watching with eyes
wide shut.
</P>
<P>
   And if anyone, including Patriots owner Bob Kraft or personnel
director Bobby Grier, watched the Rams play offense and defense and
concluded the players they have are their equal, they are saying it
with their fingers crossed.
</P>
<P>
   If anything was clear at the Trans World Dome it's this. They
play a different kind of football here with a different kind of
player.
</P>
<P>
   Better ones.

MORE OFFENSE BREWING FOR BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Sergei Samsonov . . . definitely. Dave Andreychuk . . .
maybe.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, with ties in their last two games but 1-8-4 over
their last 13 and 0-3-2 over their last five, take on the Atlanta
Thrashers Monday at the FleetCenter with one (Samsonov) and
possibly two (Andreychuk?) of their top scorers back in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Both practiced Sunday at the FleetCenter, where Samsonov, out
the last 10 days with a knee sprain, pronounced himself ready for
action. Andreychuk, who limped off the ice Tuesday in the final
seconds of the Toronto game with a sore knee, is hoping for a
return Monday, but wants to see how he feels this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't expecting to be out that long, but you can't really
predict those kinds of things. I was hoping it would be
day-to-day,'' said Samsonov. ``I'm feeling more comfortable now, so
I'm ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Andreychuk said he felt better after practice than before.
``It's day-to-day,'' he said. ``I've still got a little bit of
swelling, so we'll see how it goes. I'm hoping I can play. I'll see
the doctor early in the morning and we'll find out then.''
</P>
<P>
   It's safe to say both were feeling a lot better physically than
their coach, Pat Burns, who left practice early because of the flu
that has hit a few members of the team recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrible. I stayed up all night coughing. I couldn't go
out to dinner (Saturday) night in Montreal and I got up (Sunday)
with a terrible headache,'' said Burns, who at least feels a bit
better about his team's recent play, a 3-2 loss to Toronto in which
the Bruins outshot the Leafs by a wide margin and ties against
Buffalo (0-0) and the Canadiens (2-2).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've battled every single game lately,'' said Burns, who was
not satisfied, nevertheless, with the Bruins' tendency to cough up
the puck, particularly with the man advantage. ``We were losing the
puck like we were school kids,'' he said. ``That's not the system.
That's personal. We touched on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said goalie Byron Dafoe's play has been a key of late.
``He's been a lot better. He's coming out a little bit more,'' said
Burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still building, confidence-wise,'' said defenseman Kyle
McLaren. ``The last week and a half, two weeks, we've been really
playing hard. We haven't gotten a win, but the work is there, the
passion is there, and guys want to win. It's just a matter of going
out there and finishing off our plays. Our power play's been
struggling and those are the things that we'll have to pick up in
order for us to win.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaren said the power play _ a dismal 0 for 16 over the last
three games _ probably could use an injection of intensity,
especially with Jason Allison out for the season. ``Things don't
happen just by being out there on the ice. You have to work at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The low-scoring games of late have been to McLaren's liking.
</P>
<P>
   ``They build your confidence,'' he said. ``We have a job to do,
which is play defense and keep the goals-against down and help get
our forwards into the offense a little bit. The intensity is there
and the work ethic is there and most of the time, when you have
that, you have a good chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Thornton said the long-term loss of Allison and the recent
spate of injuries that have sidelined Samsonov and Andreychuk, as
well as Joe Hulbig and Shawn Bates, have made the Bruins dig down
for something extra.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the guys in here care,'' said Thornton. ``We're
missing a lot of players, but over the last two games, everyone's
shown up to play and given us a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Andreychuk put it even more bluntly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, our backs are against the wall,'' he said. ``We
just have to look at the standings and realize these games are
important to us. I think we've played pretty well in our last three
games. We haven't got a victory, but we're close. It was the same
thing at the start of the year. We were playing well and got close,
but we were in a dry spell there, too. It just takes a couple of
efforts to get over the hump.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to go through the bad spells to realize what it takes
to get out of them, especially for the younger guys.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hulbig (groin strain) and Bates (wrist sprain) skated Sunday,
with Hulbig's return more imminent. ``I've made great strides over
the last three days,'' said Hulbig. ``I can go out there at about
80 percent, but the only problem I have right now is off the jump,
off the stop and start. I'm aiming for the road trip (three games,
starting in Atlanta Wednesday) right now.'' . . . Wing Rob DiMaio
didn't practice after experiencing a slight groin strain, but
expects to play Monday. ``He could have practiced,'' said Burns,
``but I'd rather have him at 50 or 60 percent than not have him at
all.'' . . . Next stop for the Bruins' Alumni team: Tuesday, Jan.
25 at 7 p.m. at the Somerville MDC Rink on Somerville Ave. The
opponent is KISS/108 and the beneficiary is Somerville Youth
Hockey. Admission is $10 for adults, $5 for children.

IT'S RETURN ADDRESS FOR CHEANEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He exchanged hugs with one of the MCI Center
workers on his way out of practice. Earlier, he chatted with former
teammate Juwan Howard. Monday, he'll have more than a few ticket
requests.
</P>
<P>
   This used to be home for Calbert Cheaney. Until this past
August, when he signed with the Celtics as a free agent, it had
been his only home. For six steady if unspectacular years, he
played for the Bullets/Wizards, starting out with the likes of Tom
Gugliotta, Rex Chapman, and Michael Adams in 1993 and finishing
last season with Howard, Rod Strickland, and Mitch Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Cheaney played for six coaches in six years here, and the
constant theme was disappointment and underachievement. He has
left, and things have not changed. The Wizards are in last place in
the division with a humongous payroll and no clue, hoping that
general manager/owner-in-waiting Michael Jordan can do in the front
office what he did on the basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Cheaney made his first visit here since leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be back,'' he said following a short workout in
preparation for Monday's game with the Wizards. ``When you stay in
a place for so long, you're going to have friends and relationships
with people. It was nice to see everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheaney and the Wizards basically made a mutual decision to part
ways. As he put it, ``I knew it was time for me to move on.'' But
he said he still considers this a special part of the NBA
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still love the organization and all the people associated
with it,'' he said. ``It's a great organization and a great city.
But I know now that I'm with the right team.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheaney made his first start of the season Saturday in the
Celtics' win over the Nets. He played a season-high 42 minutes.
Monday, he'll be back on the bench, as Rick Pitino indicated he'd
go with Walter McCarty against the taller Howard. That's fine with
Cheaney.
</P>
<P>
   He said he doesn't know what kind of reaction he'll get. ``I
hope it's nice,'' he said. ``But really, it's over. I just want to
get a win.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Walker, fresh off his 39-point performance in New
Jersey, did not practice because of a sore left knee. But he said
he was fine, and Pitino indicated there was no problem. Eric
Williams, who sat out the New Jersey game resting a sore right
knee, practiced and will be available . . . The Wizards may be
without Richmond, who bruised his ribs in Saturday's loss to the
Pistons . . . Two Chicago television stations sent crews to
Saturday's game, hoping to get a glimpse of Jordan. He wasn't there
. . . The victory over the Nets showcased a Celtics team that
Pitino has been looking for all season. The Nets and the Celtics
are, in some ways, a lot alike, two young teams with potential
stars to lead them. ``We've got a good nucleus,'' Pitino said. He
said there were two ways the team could go: ``Stay together, grow
together, get better, and add to it, or say it's not that good,
break it all up, or blow it apart. That's a decision you make.
We're not at that (blow it up) stage. Paul Pierce is basically a
rookie. Adrian Griffin is a rookie. Vitaly Potapenko is young. Tony
Battie is young. Let these guys grow together. That's how I feel.''
. . . Griffin will finish up his five-game minimum stay on the
injured list Monday. The Celtics return home for games Wednesday
(Toronto) and Friday (Seattle) . . . Pitino said he really enjoyed
the 2 1/2-hour train ride to Washington after the New Jersey game.
``It was fun. You guys (in the media) should have come,'' he said,
forgetting that the media is not invited to travel with the team.
``There were big tables, very good bonding.''

JONES KEEPS TITLE _ SINGLE-HANDEDLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What do Pedro Martinez and Roy Jones Jr. have in
common?
</P>
<P>
   They both can pitch a shutout with one hand.
</P>
<P>
   That is the norm for the Red Sox ace, but usually the undisputed
light heavyweight champion needs both hands to complete his work.
Saturday night he would have liked to have had that luxury, but he
did not, so he accomplished the same goal with half his weaponry
instead, and made it look easy.
</P>
<P>
   That would be considered remarkable for most professional
fighters, but with Jones it might have gone unnoticed had he not
mentioned it after the decision was announced. The bout could not
have been more one-sided if the champion had had three healthy
hands.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to Saturday's first-ever fight at Radio
City Music Hall, challenger David Telesco kept saying he'd had a
dream about what would happen there and would share it after the
fight. When the dream turned into a nightmare of Jones's right
hands to the face, however, he not only kept mum about his dream,
he kept well-hidden.
</P>
<P>
   Too embarrassed by his performance to come to the post-fight
news conference, Telesco sent his apologies via his promoter after
losing every round to a fighter who had fractured his left wrist 3
1/2 weeks earlier in a motorcycle accident back home in Pensacola,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   There's no telling how much damage Jones might have done if he
had been healthy, but he did enough to restructure Telesco's face
in a way that forced the Port Chester, N.Y., native to use
sunglasses after the fight ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it took a while, but sometimes you have to do it that
way,'' Jones (41-1) said after throwing 494 punches, according to
CompuBox statistics, with about 85 percent coming from the same
direction.
</P>
<P>
   That knowledge didn't help poor Telesco, who was so much slower
that only one round _ the seventh _ was even remotely competitive.
Yet after the judges' cards of Melvina Latham, Luis Rivera, and Sid
Rubenstein were read and not one gave Telesco a round, the
challenger muttered ``I thought I did enough to win.''
</P>
<P>
   One assumes he was speaking of Round 7 or speaking with a
concussion, because under no other circumstances would those words
have made the remotest sense.
</P>
<P>
   From the opening bell, it was clear that the 12-1 underdog's
hand speed was no match for Jones, who proves time and again he is
without peer in his weight class and, perhaps, in any class,
pound-for-pound.
</P>
<P>
   No one is more aware of that than Jones, whose disdain for his
opponents is clear each time he fights. Saturday it was obvious
when the curtain rose on the Music Hall's stage, and Jones was
standing smack in the middle of a lineup of Radio City Rockettes,
high kicking with the best of them barely an hour before the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Jones's lack of concern for Telesco's challenge or his own
health was apparent then, but had anyone known of his injury, his
nonchalance would have been even more evident. What was obvious
immediately was that Telesco would not stop Jones's rapier right
hand with anything but his face most of the night. After just three
minutes, both of Telesco's cheekbones were red, and they only would
become more so as the fight wore on. But they were not as red as
they would become after the scorecards were read and he had not won
a round.
</P>
<P>
   Telesco was ready to dispute that, if nothing else, but arguably
he didn't win a single moment of a single round, although in the
seventh he at least landed several short hooks, and in the fifth he
drilled Jones in the body on several occasions when the champion
chose to stand deep in a neutral corner and wave Telesco in to
attack.
</P>
<P>
   At first, a wary Telesco (23-3) refused to budge, but finally
the target was too inviting, so he attacked. It didn't make a bit
of difference, just as Jones's broken wrist made no difference
except that it probably was the only reason Telesco finished the
night on his feet. In the fight game, you thank your lucky stars
for such tender mercies.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps emboldened or maybe just embarrassed, Telesco began to
taunt the champion midway through the fight, trying to turn a
boxing match into a street brawl that might have been more to his
advantage. He got nothing out of those efforts but a few more right
hands to the face and a brief conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You ever been in prison?' '' Jones explained when
asked what the former convict had to say to him. ``I said, `No, and
I don't plan on going.' I have to give him credit. The guy is
tough. But that's a hell of a thing to ask me.''
</P>
<P>
   Not when you're being mugged by a one-armed man, it isn't.

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Computer industry analysts and stock traders dithered
Friday. Does Bill Gates's move to the newly-created job of ``chief
software officer'' mean Microsoft is set for breakup, a merger with
some new media company, or simply tackling the challenge of
competing in the Internet-driven marketplace?
</P>
<P>
   For computer users, the more important question is: is this the
beginning of the end for Microsoft, or a rebirth of the 25-year-old
company?
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives insisted there were no Machiavellian plans,
that they expected neither a breakup or a merger, and their true
intent was to get Microsoft in shape for the challenges of
competing operating systems such as Linux, of wireless and handheld
devices and of emerging Internet-centered software systems.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft does need to catch up fast there. Linux is used by a
growing number of companies.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's operating system for handheld devices, WindowsCE, is
a poor third and losing touch in a fast-growing market. It has
struggled to make itself known in the wireless trade, forecast to
be huge in the next decade.

<P>
   Paul Allen, Microsoft's co-founder, who has long since left the
company, said categorically: ``Anyone who thinks this is a reaction
to the lawsuit...is getting it completely wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's share price did nothing but rise following
Thursday's announcement, floating gently up in after-hours trading
then gaining a further two points in Friday morning's session to
around $110.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts saw Gates's decision to abandon the top slot in
favor of his deputy Steve Ballmer as a positive development. But
others wondered if the share price movement did not have more to do
with the anticipation of a corporate carve-up: if it followed the
telephone company AT&AMP;T, which was broken up in the 1980s, Microsoft
stockholders would end up even richer.
</P>
<P>
   It came at the end of a week of wild news development and even
wilder rumors.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday came the announcement of America Online's megamerger
with Time Warner; Wednesday brought whispers from the Justice
Department that it might split Microsoft into two or more pieces to
end its operating system monopoly, and late on Thursday came
Gates's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Cause and effect? Or an admission that Ballmer was a better
manager?
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft insists Gates will have plenty on his hands, trying to
control the work on Windows2000, a new version of the
``industrial-strength'' operating system due for release in
February. It will run the back offices of the world's banks and
businesses, but is horrendously late and bug-ridden.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department also put in a touch on the tiller, saying
the whispers had been misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   Gates intended to oversee the development of new technology
personally, in his twin new roles as chairman and chief software
architect, while Ballmer would conduct day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts broadly accepted this version of events. ``For
Gates, I believe that this is about making the Internet work for
Microsoft,'' said Rick Sherlund of Goldman Sachs. ``That's where
his heart is.''
</P>
<P>
   But one source close to the company quoted in the San Jose
Mercury News, the Silicon Valley daily, said the reshuffle at the
top might have been an attempt to reassure nervous executives as
they make contingency plans for a possible breakup.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the team managers have plans ready...'' the source
said. ``But what they're concerned about is how Gates will react if
he's forced to do it. If he's backed into a corner, he might
explode.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts reacted with alarm at Gates' statement that ``in
the revolution ahead of us, software will be at the center,''
saying the opposite was true.
</P>
<P>
   Gates' replacement with a man of similar temperament and ideas
was thus a sign of weakness and inflexibility, they said. &QL;

   SEATTLE _ Computer industry analysts and stock traders dithered
Friday. Does Bill Gates's move to the newly-created job of ``chief
software officer'' mean Microsoft is set for breakup, a merger with
some new media company, or simply tackling the challenge of
competing in the Internet-driven marketplace?
</P>
<P>
   For computer users, the more important question is: is this the
beginning of the end for Microsoft, or a rebirth of the 25-year-old
company?
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives insisted there were no Machiavellian plans,
that they expected neither a breakup or a merger, and their true
intent was to get Microsoft in shape for the challenges of
competing operating systems such as Linux, of wireless and handheld
devices and of emerging Internet-centered software systems.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft does need to catch up fast there. Linux is used by a
growing number of companies.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's operating system for handheld devices, WindowsCE, is
a poor third and losing touch in a fast-growing market. It has
struggled to make itself known in the wireless trade, forecast to
be huge in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Allen, Microsoft's co-founder, who has long since left the
company, said categorically: ``Anyone who thinks this is a reaction

IT FEELS LIKE A ROAD MATCH AT ROSE BOWL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ As much as the United States and the Islamic Republic
of Iran downplayed the historical significance of Sunday's first
meeting between the two soccer counties on U.S. soil, at the Rose
Bowl, it was hard to ignore the festive and political atmosphere
that surrounded the much-hyped match especially with planes
carrying banners overhead that opposed the Islamic Regime.
</P>
<P>
   And the United States, as it has shown in the past, proved again
that this is the only country in the world where you prepare for
hostile road matches in your own country.
</P>
<P>
   Reminiscent of the pro-Mexican crowds here before, a mostly
pro-Iranian crowd of 50,181 was constantly singing, screaming and
celebrating Iran's 1-1 draw with the United States, in the second
meeting between the two countries since Iran beat the U.S. 2-1
during the 1998 World Cup in France.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. striker Cobi Jones has been in plenty of ``road matches''
in Southern California before, but he was surprised by the noise
level demonstrated by the Iranian fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This crowd was extremely loud, one of the loudest I've ever
played in front of,'' Jones said. ``It makes it difficult. You
don't like to play at home and be the actual away team, but that's
what we have to live with in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. defender Frankie Hejduk, who urged American fans to make
the trip to Pasadena earlier this week, was dissatisfied with the
lack of American support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to have the Iranian fans; without them, there
wouldn't have been too many people here,'' said Hejduk. ``You would
think that eventually our American fans would catch on. We could
lose 10 in a row or win 10 in a row and it would be the same fans
out here every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe the lack of nationality that some people show.
Here was a huge game between two political nations that are
opposite. And in our own country there were more of them than us.
</P>
<P>
   ``These games are only two hours long. You would think that with
all the people participating in soccer in this country, and
especially in Southern California, that we would have more fans
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for the U.S., the Iranian fans didn't have much added
incentive because the Americans dominated most of the match.
</P>
<P>
   Iran countered most of the afternoon, scoring the game's first
goal when Mehdi Mahdavikia took a pass from Khodadad Azizi and
split U.S. defenders Marcelo Balboa and Carlos Llamosa in the
seventh minute, beating U.S. keeper Brad Friedel to the far post.
</P>
<P>
   After a number of missed chances, Jones sent a curling cross in
the 48th minute that Chris Armas one-touched to the upper-netting
to tie the match.
</P>
<P>
   With the Gold Cup next month, the U.S. Cup in June and World Cup
qualifying starting later this year, Jones was happy with the U.S.
team's effort but disappointed with the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a game that we would have liked to have won because I
felt we handled them for the most part,'' Jones said. ``It's a good
sign that we did fight back and control 80 percent of the game.
That was the big difference between playing Iran today and playing
them two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. record improved to 7-4-2 since Arena took over the team
at the beginning of 1999. A draw against Iran would seem to
indicate a step backward, but Arena dismissed those claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world of soccer is getting smaller in terms of soccer
countries, they're much closer together now,'' he said. ``The top
50 soccer-playing countries on a given day can beat each other, and
Iran, I believe, is among the top 50.''

USC LANDS ANOTHER OFFENSIVE LINEMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ USC received an oral commitment Sunday from
Newport Harbor High offensive lineman Blair Jones, considered one
of the top players at his position in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Jones (6-foot-7, 244 pounds) selected USC over Michigan,
Colorado and Washington. He is the 15th player to commit to the
Trojans, who have seven scholarships remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans have received commitments from three offensive
lineman: Jones, Joe McGuire of Servite High and Phillip Eaves of
Riverside Community College.
</P>
<P>
   Another offensive lineman, Travis Watkins (6-4, 290) of Helix
High in San Diego, could commit to the Trojans this week. He has
narrowed his choices to USC and San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   USC reserve defensive lineman Darren Collins, who will be a
senior next year, is transferring to a Division I-AA school.
Portland State is the front-runner.

U.S. WOULD CONSIDER PLAYING IN IRAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHARD GONZALEZ  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; PASADENA, Calif. _ Following the 1-1 draw with Iran on Sunday
at the Rose Bowl, U.S. coach Bruce Arena was asked if the U.S.
would consider playing a friendly in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   In their only other meeting, Iran beat the U.S. 2-1 during the
1998 World Cup in France. A group of U.S. wrestlers visited Iran in
1998, but no other sports team has visited Iran since the 1979
hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were invited, I'm sure it is an invitation we would
strongly consider,'' Arena said. ``There's lot of issues involved,
whether we could fit it in, but I would not be opposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get involved in the politics. I don't know the reality
of the situation. But having played today, we would love to play
Iran again.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Unfriendly confines: So just how many Americans were among
the Rose Bowl crowd of 50,181, you ask?
</P>
<P>
   Other than a collection from ``Sam's Army'' deposited over the
tunnel entrance to the U.S. locker room, not many.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources within the USSF, only about 3,000 tickets
were purchased by Americans during the initial wave of selling
early last month. Shortly thereafter, the Iranian federation was
allowed to purchase the tickets, with supporters doing so en masse
as the sales figure immediately ballooned to 34,000.
</P>
<P>
   By the look of Sunday's overwhelming throng donning the red,
white and green, the ratio obviously never eased during the final
month of sales.
</P>
<P>
   __ Wasted fuel: The one blown investment on game day went to the
poor soul who paid for a plane to fly overhead with a banner that
read, ``Go Eric the Cannon Wynalda.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynalda, at age 30 and in the twilight of his career, was not
among the players on the 18-man roster declared by Arena.

LAKERS LET GO OF STREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Lakers arrived at LAX early Sunday
morning having lost their biggest piece of carry-on luggage during
their three-game road trip. But they won't miss it much.
</P>
<P>
   Their 16-game winning streak was left behind in Indianapolis,
thanks to the Pacers' efforts Friday night. Travelers' insurance
won't cover the loss. But as they have so many times this season,
the Lakers bounced back quickly with Saturday's victory at
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a hallmark of coach Phil Jackson's team all season.
The Lakers, owners of an NBA-best 32-6 record, are the only team in
the league that hasn't lost consecutive games. So what does that
say about them?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope a lot,'' Derek Fisher said. ``Good teams have to be
able to do that. We've shown the ability to do that so far,
especially on the road. If you can do that on the road, that really
says a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Lakers have said a mouthful: Prior to the loss at
Indiana, they had won eight straight on the road, a streak not even
the Showtime Lakers ever matched. It was the franchise's longest
road streak since the 1972-73 team won 13 in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Lakers have lost just twice since Nov. 22, a span
of 56 days.
</P>
<P>
   And in another mark of resiliency, the Lakers are 12-1 on the
second night of back-to-backs this season.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's been impossible to put much distance between themselves
and the Portland Trail Blazers, 3 games back with a 28-9 record,
second best in the NBA. But Fisher said the Lakers, who play host
to the Blazers on Saturday, aren't feeling any pressure to hold
them off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really. I think it's more about what we want to do, what
we want to accomplish,'' he said. ``We all know they're there, but
we don't play our games worrying about what they're doing. We do
what we have to do and the wins will come and they'll continue to
be second.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Down time: After playing four games in six days, the Lakers
get a break, with just three games in eight days, all at home.
Jackson gave players the day off Sunday.

A GREAT DAY FOR DIXIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif._ Even before Pat Valenzuela rode Dixie Dot Com
for the first time in the San Pasqual Handicap, the rider and the
horse had something in common. Each was working on a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Each took a big step in a return to the top Sunday as Valenzuela
put Dixie Dot Com in perfect position behind a swift front-runner
and the 5-year-old responded with a 1-length victory over Budroyale
in the San Pasqual.
</P>
<P>
   For Dixie Dot Com, the victory came a year to the day after his
latest win, in the San Fernando Stakes, in which he went to the top
of his class locally but suffered a leg fracture that forced a
nearly eight-month layoff.
</P>
<P>
   For Valenzuela, the Grade II San Pasqual marked his first
graded-stakes victory since the 1996 Del Mar Handicap aboard
Dernier Empereur, before the Kentucky Derby-winning jockey's
two-year suspension for drug-related absences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of seconds and thirds lately,'' Valenzuela
said, listing stakes near-misses Straight Man, Stormy Jack, Classy
Lady and Mr. Broad Blade. ``Today the good Lord blessed us with a
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela, who finished second to Laffit Pincay in the jockey
standings at Hollywood Park, the second meet since his license was
restored, is tied for fourth in the Santa Anita standings with 13
wins. But victories in big races like the $200,000 San Pasqual have
eluded him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it's like you guys wrote when I started back `We'll
see what happens,' '' Valenzuela said. He thinks major trainers and
owners have taken a wait-and-see approach with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't blame them at all,'' he said. ``But now they're
putting me on good horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixie Dot Com ($11.20) lived up to that description again in
Sunday's 1 1/16-mile race after finishing out of the money in the
first three starts of his comeback, two on the Hollywood Park turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, when this horse ran so well in the San Fernando, we
were talking about all the big things we had planned for him,''
trainer Bill Morey said, apparently wanting not to tempt fate.
``I'm going to be a little more conservative now until we see how
he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, Dixie Dot Com, a winner of 6 of 13 starts, will aim
for the Feb. 6 San Antonio and March 4 Santa Anita Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Budroyale, racing for the first time since he was runner-up to
Cat Thief in the Breeders' Cup Classic, was left with too much
ground to make up in the San Pasqual. The favorite finished 1
lengths in front of pacesetter Six Below.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe as he's getting older, he doesn't have the (early) speed
he used to have,'' trainer Ted H. West said. ``Maybe he's more of a
mile-and-a-quarter horse now.''
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Madero, a top handicap horse a year ago, finished last in
the six-horse race, disappointing trainer Richard Mandella, who
thought the 6-year-old's recovery from ulcers would signal a return
to form.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: The 1999 Eclipse Award winners will be announced
tonight at a dinner in Beverly Hills. Horse of the Year is down to
sprinter Artax, Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner Charismatic and
Breeders' Cup Turf winner Daylami. . . . Olympic Charmer ($4.40)
ran her record to 6 for 12 by inching past Her She Kisses in the El
Encino Stakes for 4-year-old fillies Sunday, extending her winning
range to 1 1/16 miles. . . . Three-year-old War Chant is an
impressive 2 for 2 after a 1 1/16-mile allowance win. . . . Jockey
Brice Blanc wasn't seriously hurt in a fall after Biker Dude broke
down at the top of the stretch in a turf sprint. The horse had to
be destroyed. . . . Bobby Frankel has favorites Spanish Fern and
Keeper Hill as the trainer tries for his fourth San Gorgonio
Handicap in five years on the 12:30 p.m. Martin Luther King Day
program. . . . Kelly Kip finished fourth behind winner Mountain Top
in Gulfstream Park's Hallandale Beach Handicap in the sprint star's
return from a hock infection.

 INSIDERS SPECULATE ON POSSIBLE BUSH TICKET  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;       c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The best buzz from the Republican National Committee meeting this
week in San Jose, Calif. _ heavy-duty George W. Bush country _ was
about who the GOP front-runner might pick as a running mate if it
goes the way they hope.
<P>
   Bush doesn't have it locked up, but that isn't stopping anyone
from speculating.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain, who's putting up a good fight in New
Hampshire, has said he isn't interested. Some Republicans here said
no matter: McCain's too much of a maverick to be controlled as a
vice presidential candidate. Besides, how can he suddenly start
toning down his campaign finance stance when he's on stage with
Bush?
</P>
<P>
   And there's Gen. Colin Powell, who also pooh-poohs the idea. So?
``He's definitely in play,'' said one knowing RNC official. ``And a
Bush-Powell ticket would blow the Democrats away.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't go over well with a top conservative GOP voice. He
said Powell's ``Rockefeller Republican'' outlook and pro-choice
style would ``send conservatives walking, absolutely.'' Same for
New Jersey Gov. Christine Whitman, also pro-choice.
</P>
<P>
   So the conventional wisdom among Republican activists here goes
like this: Bush may go with the gut and make a surprise pick _ a la
Dan Quayle _ or he can get strategic.
</P>
<P>
   So there are plenty of Republicans who are furiously
strategizing for him. Their views of who's hot (and who's not):
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of ONPOLITI () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &UR; _ California Rep. Christopher Cox: &LR;  No kidding. The argument is
that Bush has Texas in the bag. He's got a good shot at Florida,
thanks to brother Jeb. ``If someone can deliver California, you can
put a fork in it _ they're (Democrats) done,'' said one RNC biggie.
Newport Beach, Calif.'s Cox is one of the brainiest folks on
Capitol Hill, an anti-Quayle, if you will. He's often been
discussed for a statewide run. He's well known to the Republican
base. He's strong on China _ witness the Cox Report _ with strong
foreign affairs credentials. He's anti-abortion, and he's Catholic,
a strong voting bloc that can deliver big-time. The downside: even
a sharp congressman like Cox is not well known in Northern
California, never mind outside the state. A long shot, but an
interesting one.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ California Rep. David Dreier:  &LR; Like Cox, Southern
California's Dreier is one of two California congressmen often
mentioned for higher office. He's attractive (word is that he
recently dated Bo Derek). He's got solid support from state
Republicans. But could he deliver California? See ``downside'' of
Cox argument.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Sen. Richard Lugar, Illinois: &LR;  Midwest powerhouse, foreign
affairs heavy, smart guy, big credentials. GOPers are talking.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Gov. Tom Ridge, Pennsylvania: &LR;  Big governor from a Northeast
state, a plus. High-tech savvy; has hit big in Silicon Valley,
another plus. Catholic, another plus. Pro-choice. ``A pro-choice
Catholic? That would be an insult to Catholics,'' said one top
GOPer, who says that puts Ridge out.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Gov. George Pataki, New York: &LR;  The top insider of a rival
campaign insists that this will be the ticket. Pro-choice also, but
if he can deliver New York ...
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Elizabeth Dole: &LR;  It's over. High profile, good name, good
campaigner, sure. But GOPers here rule her out for one reason:
``The bumper sticker.'' Besides, she hasn't proved she can deliver
women voters, and Bush doesn't seem to have a gender gap problem
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Governors John Engler of Michigan and Tommy Thompson of &LR; 
 &UR; Wisconsin:  &LR; Loyal and big names, considered on the short list last
time around. This time, who knows?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Senator John Ashcroft: &LR;  ``The Christian Coalition loves him,
just loves him,'' said one leading RNC conservative. Plus, Ashcroft
has ex-staffers and supporters in place high inside the Bush team,
so he's got a cheering section making his case. ``There've been
discussions already on this one,'' the conservative said.

 FASTER THAN A SPEEDING JUDGE  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Bad, bad boy Jack Bokin bolted out of the Hall of Justice in San
Francisco on Friday, chased by deputies and the judge who was about
to hand down sentence. I give it three weeks before that scene
winds up on a TV cop show.
<P>
   In the office pool, I'll take ``Nash Bridges.'' And in the
Hollywood version, guaranteed, the judge makes the tackle, robes
flowing, and Nash growls at the bad guy, ``Justice is swift,
Bubba.''
</P>
<P>
   In real life it was a deputy who made the flying tackle, and
maybe the 49ers' search for a tough and speedy cornerback is over.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad for Bad Jack that he didn't make it as far as the
McDonald's on the corner next to the Hall of Justice, where they
might have affirmed his efforts by saying, ``You deserve a break
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Bokin, convicted of rape and attempted murder, was about to be
sent up the lazy river for 246 lazy years when he split, and as
Matt Regan says, ``Talk about your run-on sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming soon: Judges' shoes by Nike-Air Jailbreak.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE OPPOSITE &LR;  of a jailbreak looms for P.J. Carlesimo, recently
fired as coach of the Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   After years of firing girlfriends under his ``Three Dates and
You're Out'' policy/philosophy, P.J. has got himself engaged.
</P>
<P>
   They met at Moose's Restaurant in North Beach a year ago, but
probably won't hold the reception there. Not long after meeting the
love of his life, Carlesimo spirited away Moose's general manager,
Bob Mulhern, and they partnered up to open the lively P.J.
Mulhern's just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; UNCLEAR ON THE CONCEPT:  &LR; Women.com released on Monday its list
of the 10 most eligible bachelors in Silicon Valley. Basically,
they're computer dweebs who work 20-hour days, which makes them
most eligible for what? Heart attacks? Hemorrhoids?
</P>
<P>
   Technically, they are available because nine of the 10 guys are
not romantically involved with anything but a keyboard. But who
knows? If the right woman comes along and the chemistry clicks, any
one of these cyberstuds might be willing to squeeze a torrid
romance into his midday vending-machine break.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHAT'S THE DEAL?  &LR; I turned on the TV on Sunday, and they're
still playing NFL football. Isn't the season over?
</P>
<P>
   The heartwarming story of the playoffs, and possibly the
SuperBowl, is the woebegone St. Louis Rams and their castoff
quarterback, Kurt Warner.
</P>
<P>
   However, we're also going to have to hear songs of praise for
Rams' team owner Georgia Frontiere. She inherited the Rams after
the mysterious death of her husband Dominic, and her crowning
achievements as an owner so far have been to exaggerate her golf
handicap in her media-guide bio, to kiss players on the sidelines
and to be the first sports owner to have a luxury box with a hot
tub.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Georgia fits right into the cartoonish club of
pro sports team owners.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WITH ALL &LR;  the new quiz shows _ ``Greed,'' ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire?'' and ``Who Wants to Be a Greedy Millionaire?'' _ what
if they run out of questions?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THERE'S GLOOM &LR;  at the Boom Boom Room, John Lee Hooker's blues
club.
</P>
<P>
   They've pulled the plug on a big mural project, which had Willie
Brown's enthusiastic support and was to grace the side of the club
facing Geary Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   It boils down to some neighborhood backroom bickering, and the
result is the area and the city being deprived of a colorful
tribute to the rich musical and cultural heritage of the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NAME CHANGE:  &LR; After Friday night's festivities, shouldn't they
change the name of the Oakland Alameda County Arena to the OK
Corral?
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, even though it's the home of the Warriors, who can't shoot
straight.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEY CAME, &LR;  they saw, they flopped onto the dock and called it
home.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, the sea lions hauled themselves onto the dock
outside Pier 39, so the pier will hold an anniversary celebration
next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   As my travel agent Seymour Seitz says, their arrival was a hell
of a lot easier and cheaper than bringing in a pro sports
franchise. Besides, the seals are more entertaining than the
well-paid Warriors, and so far they haven't threatened to leave
town if the city doesn't build them a new, splinter-free dock.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's too touristy to check out the sea lions, but I
watched 'em for a half hour recently, and it's a great show. Two
males battled for possession of one dock and its load of females.
Honk if you're horny.
</P>
<P>
   It's what you won't see in Silicon Valley _ eligible bachelors
with time to spend on women.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BEWARE,  &LR; says Berkeley Bob, of creeping Los Angelesism.
</P>
<P>
   Bob heard a radio ad for a new Home Depot in Livermore, ``near
the 580.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoa! Who wrote that ad? As every L.A.-to-the-Bay transplant
quickly learns, up here you don't put a ``the'' in front of the
freeway number. In L.A., you take the 605 to the 405. Here you take
101 to 280.
</P>
<P>
   Says Berkeley Bob, ``Before Home Depot decides that we have to
call 880 `the 880,' we should link arms and shut the puppy down.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ALSO CREEPING &LR;  into town from Lozzzangeles: the Cheesecake
Factory, a SoCal franchise coming soon to Macy's at Union Square.
</P>
<P>
   On the menu: Herb roasted chicken. If they make a subtle change,
to Herb roasted squab, they'll be paying a nice tribute to the
lategreat Mr. Caen, who never met a pigeon he wouldn't rather see
roasted or toasted than roosted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AND SPEAKING &LR;  of lategreats, happy holiday to you, Dr. King.

<P>
   JOHNSTON, Iowa _ In the final Republican debate for this key
state's Jan. 24 presidential caucuses, front-runner Gov. George
Bush sparred with his two closest rivals Saturday over his record
of cutting taxes in Texas and whether his $483 billion tax-cut plan
helps low-income women.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon meeting, sponsored by the Des Moines Register, was
more amicable than one in Durham, N.H. last week where Bush and
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., pointed fingers at each other and argued
vociferously over taxes.
</P>
<P>
   As they began their last week of campaigning before the Iowa
caucuses, the candidates ranged over a wide variety of topics, some
old and some new. Among them: Education, preserving family farms,
environmental protection, and U.S. policy on China.
</P>
<P>
   Bush holds a commanding lead in most Iowa polls. The Des Moines
Register's Iowa Poll, for instance, last week put Bush at 45
percent, with publishing magnate Steve Forbes running a distant
second with 18 percent. The other candidates, McCain, conservative
activist Gary Bauer, conservative radio commentator Alan Keyes, and
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, all lingered far behind in single digits.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is officially not competing in Iowa and has no formal
organization in the state.
</P>
<P>
   When the candidates were allowed to question each other, Bush
criticized McCain's $170 billion tax plan that would deny
deductions for business expenses for transportation, meals and
continuing education. Bush said the plan would hurt working
Americans, particularly the ``single mom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I have to say to the single mom is that I've
got a tax cut for you and Gov. Bush doesn't,'' McCain shot back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true,'' Bush responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes it is true,'' McCain said, insisting his plan addresses
the looming financial problems of the Social Security trust fund
while paring down the $5.6 trillion national debt. Bush defended
his plan, saying it sets aside $2 billion to save Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Forbes charged that the real estate tax cuts that Bush
supported in Texas had no impact on the wallets of six of 10
Texans. Bush, raising his voice in one of the few heated moments of
the debate, told Forbes _ the scion of the wealthy Forbes
publishing family _ that ``it may not be real in million-dollar
houses, but it's real if you got a $40,000 house.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his real estate tax cuts could amount to a 25 percent
reduction for some Texas homeowners. ``It's really real for a lot
of folks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The debate on taxes was interspersed with a few unusual moments,
including Hatch's repeated touting of his paid TV commercial, a
so-called ``fireside chat,`` and Keyes substituting a prayer for
his closing remarks.
</P>
<P>
   With Iowa's economy much improved since the rust-belt era of the
1980s, morality and character are top agenda items for Iowa
Republicans, according to the Register's Iowa Poll. Among
Republicans, 72 percent responded that upholding the highest
standards of personal conduct is an ``unbreakable rule'' for
candidates. By contrast, only 40 percent of Democrats agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a morality-and-character question, Bauer invoked
his service in the Reagan administration, recalling that Reagan
always wore a coat and tie in the Oval Office. ``I don't have to
remind or embarrass this audience about what the current president
did in this office,'' Bauer said, referring to President Clinton's
meetings with then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky for Oval
Office trysts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said a president's oath of office includes an implicit
pledge to preserve the dignity of the office of the presidency.
Bush said that if elected, he would appoint officials who see
``service to our country as a privilege and will not stain the
house.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Iowa caucuses, registered voters in each party meet
around the state to select delegates to their party's presidential
nominating conventions.

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Denzel
Washington in a scene from ``The Hurricane.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Denzel Washington knows about the urge to fight the whole world
until you get what you want, but he also knows what it is to need
help, even if you aren't willing to admit you do.
 &HT;    Those twin impulses have informed many of the characters he's
created on film, most notably his interpretation of boxer Rubin
``Hurricane'' Carter in the new film, ``The Hurricane.'' But
they've also figured prominently in his own story.
 &HT;    ``My mother saved my life,'' he says bluntly, looking back on
his early teens in Mount Vernon, N.Y., when he began hanging out
with a bad crowd. ``My mother got tough and said, `You're going to
boarding school.' And she sent me away.
 &HT;    ``The rest of the guys in the bunch I was pals with ended up in
prison.''
 &HT;    Now 45, Washington knows prison only secondhand, as an actor
playing prisoners such as Carter. Offscreen, he has become not only
a solid citizen, happily married and the father of four, but also
the biggest African-American star since Sidney Poitier, taking home
$12 million per movie.
 &HT;    Playing heroes is Washington's forte _ he's provided the moral
center for films such as ``Cry Freedom'' (l987), ``Malcolm X''
(l992) and ``Courage Under Fire'' (l996), and earned a Best
Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance as an embittered runaway
slave who finds new self-respect in ``Glory'' (l989).
 &HT;    But Washington doesn't look for squeaky-clean, comic-book leads.
His characters are troubled loners whose heroism is mingled with a
deep distrust of those around them and even of their own
self-worth.
 &HT;    His most recent film roles are both heroes, but could hardly be
more different from each other. In ``The Bone Collector'' (1999) he
plays a quadriplegic detective who substitutes brain for brawn, an
intense but dispassionate thinking machine who teams up with a
female cop (Angelina Jolie) to pursue a serial killer.
 &HT;    In ``The Hurricane,'' on the other hand, Washington plays the
real-life middleweight fighter Rubin Carter, a passionate dynamo
whose fury in the ring _ which he himself says was driven by his
hatred of the world around him _ earned him the nickname
``Hurricane.''
 &HT;    Carter's dreams of a world championship were shattered in l967,
when he was framed and wrongfully convicted of gunning down three
people in a New Jersey bar. But that was only the beginning of his
story, says Washington, who is being touted for a Best Actor Ocar
for his gripping performance.
 &HT;    When his story first became public, Carter's case became the
fashionable cause du jour for a number of celebrities. Fellow boxer
Muhammad Ali rallied to his defense, and Bob Dylan wrote a hit song
about the case, ``Hurricane.'' Carter won a second trial _ only to
be convicted again.
 &HT;    And then, as suddenly as it had begun, everything stopped.
 &HT;    ``I learned that Rubin went through an incredible spiritual
journey after his second trial also ended in conviction,''
Washington says. ``All the celebrities who had jumped on his
bandwagon abandoned him _ even Muhammad Ali dropped out. So he went
inside himself.''
 &HT;    Washington understood that kind of retreat.
 &HT;    ``I come from a very religious family,'' the actor says. ``My
father was a Pentecostal minister who worked two churches and was
this spirit-filled man until the day he died. My mother owned a
beauty parlor, and she was even more religious than he was.
 &HT;    ``But it was an oil-and-water marriage,'' he adds. ``My mother
was an urban woman raised in Harlem, my father a very rural man.''
 &HT;    The two eventually divorced in l969 _ his father died in 1991 _
and it was a bitter blow to the insecure young man. That's when his
mother sent him to a private school, the Oakland Academy in New
Windsor, N.Y., to get him away from his neighborhood pals.
 &HT;    At his new school Washington became an athlete, played in the
band and showed some interest in the arts. But only while studying
at New York's Fordham University in the mid-1970s was he bitten by
the acting bug.
 &HT;    ``That was my niche,'' he says. ``Until then I was
floundering.''
 &HT;    After achieving success in the theater, he was cast as Dr.
Phillip Chandler on the hit medical show ``St. Elsewhere''
(l982-1988). It wasn't long before he broke onto the big screen
with a series of eye-catching parts, including the escaped slave in
``Glory,'' South African activist Stephen Biko in ``Cry Freedom,''
the title role in ``Malcolm X'' and the homophobic lawyer in the
AIDS drama ``Philadelphia'' (1993).
 &HT;    Today he lives in a new, suitably grand Beverly Hills home with
his wife, Pauletta, and their four children _ 15-year-old John
David, 12-year-old Katia and 8-year-old twins, Malcolm and Olivia.
 &HT;    ``Pauletta is the rock that holds our marriage together,''
Washington says. ``Like my mother she's a deeply religious woman,
and I feel that is extremely important for our children. I know how
it helped shape my own life.
 &HT;    ``We go to church regularly, and we pray together several times
each day at home.''
 &HT;    And it isn't only prayer: The actor recently donated $5 million
to the Los Angeles church he and his family attend, the Church of
God in Christ.
 &HT;    Washington says he has been intrigued by Carter's story ever
since reading the fighter's autobiography, ``The Sixteenth Round''
(Viking, 1974). When he finally got the chance to play the role, it
came with a big bonus: At the helm was director Norman Jewison, who
had given him his breakthrough role in ``A Soldier's Story''
(1984).
 &HT;    To prepare for the role, Washington hired a boxing trainer and
began working out a year ahead of time.
 &HT;    ``I was filming `The Bone Collector,''' he recalls, ``and that
meant as the paralyzed cop I had to spend the entire day in bed. So
at the end of every day's shooting I rushed to the gym and worked
out for four hours every night. I knew that the only way I could do
justice to playing Rubin was to look the part when I stepped into
the ring.
 &HT;    ``Norman Jewison told me, `No special effect in the world is
going to make you look like a trim fighting machine. You've got to
do that,''' he adds. ``I had 18 months to lose 44 pounds and
reshape the body I had let go to pot.''
 &HT;    ``The Hurricane'' isn't only Carter's story, however. It also
traces the evolution of a young, troubled African-American boy who,
after reading ``The Sixteenth Round,'' began writing to the
imprisoned boxer. The young Lesra Martin, played in the film by
Vicellous Reon Shannon, interested his Canadian guardians in the
case, and it was their efforts which ultimately led to Carter's
freedom.
 &HT;    ``My main goal with this movie is to make sure we get it into
the schools,'' Washington says. ``I think it's very important for
African-American youths to see that anything is possible. This is
Lesra's story as much as Rubin's _ his parents were alcoholics, he
came from a ghetto and he rose above it all to become a lawyer.
 &HT;    ```Hurricane' shows that sometimes it takes great suffering for
people to realize that, to overcome the hate _ whether it's hate of
other people or hate of being unfairly locked up _ only love can
break you free.''

boy who also found himself in the middle of two battling forces. He
was known as ``Fidelito'' - actually Felix Fidel Castro Diaz - and
he was the young son of a rebel fighter named Fidel Castro. (This

   4. HONOR DR. KING WITH PROGRESS, NOT SAINTHOOD
</P>
<P>
   By Michael Eric Dyson - The New York Times Magazine The official
story of a saintly Dr. Martin King Jr. has whitewashed the truth
that America harshly resisted his call to do the right thing. It
silenced the more radical aspects of King's challenge - his
advocacy of racial compensation, his attempt to destroy poverty,
his democratic socialist beliefs, his opposition to the Vietnam
War. Most of all, it placed him far beyond the reach of mere
mortals. His flesh-and-blood struggles - and failures - became
easily dismissed as mere preamble to his inevitable ascension.

 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of the cast of
``The Others.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    The Others are getting ready to take off.
 &HT;    It's 9:45 a.m. on Stage 24 at Paramount Pictures' Hollywood lot,
and director Tobe Hooper watches intently as a group of actors
rehearse a scene in a cramped airplane set. Gabriel Macht, John
Billingsley, Melissa Crider, Bill Cobbs, Kevin J. O'Connor and John
Aylward are all seated as Julianne Nicholson steps into the aisle.
 &HT;    ``Ah, the prodigal daughter,'' Aylward says, his voice dripping
with sarcasm.
 &HT;    Nicholson acknowledges the comment with a slight smirk.
 &HT;    ``Hi, everybody,'' she says softly, plopping down next to Cobbs.
 &HT;    For the next 20 minutes, Hooper choreographs this exchange, a
quiet moment before all hell breaks loose. And on ``The Others,'' a
supernatural creepfest debuting Feb. 5 on NBC, hell hath a distinct
habit of breaking loose.
 &HT;    ``The Others'' centers on several people blessed _ or cursed _
with otherworldly powers, who band together in an effort to
understand and harness their abilities. In the process, they
unshackle the restless spirits of the dead and ease the pain of
loved ones left behind.
 &HT;    Hooper, who directed 1982's chilling ``Poltergeist,'' is only
one of the nifty genre names attached to ``The Others.'' The series
comes from Dreamworks Television, and Dreamworks co-founder Steven
Spielberg reportedly works closely with executive producers Glen
Morgan and James Wong, veterans of ``The X-Files'' and
``Millennium.''
 &HT;    Back on the set, Hooper seems satisfied. He lets the actors take
a break so that crewmen can position lights and the camera in
preparation for filming.
 &HT;    ``This episode is called `Souls on Board,''' says Billingsley,
who plays Miles Ballard, a college professor who supervises the
Others' gatherings and believes in paranormal phenomena, but has no
gifts of his own. ``This plane is flying the same route as another
one which crashed.
 &HT;    ``The plane is the same airline, same make and model number as
the one that crashed,'' he says. ``The route has been renumbered,
but people flying it are experiencing strange manifestations.
They're seeing ghosts of the passengers and crew who died in
previous flights.
 &HT;    ``I finagle our way on board without telling anyone what I'm up
to,'' Billingsley adds. ``I'm caught and have to reveal my
purposes.''
 &HT;    The actor smiles.
 &HT;    ``Sure enough,'' he says ominously, ``strange things start to
happen.''
 &HT;    Over in his trailer, Bill Cobbs takes a few minutes to relax. He
plays Elmer Greentree, the Others' 83-year-old spiritual guide and
mentor to Marian (Nicholson), the group's newest and potentially
most powerful member.
 &HT;    Cobbs is pleased that the producers of ``The Others'' cast an
African-American actor in so pivotal a role as Elmer. But the
former star of ``I'll Fly Away'' wants more.
 &HT;    ``We know we've had this problem for a while, but in 1999 we had
even fewer African-Americans, Native Americans, Asian-Americans
and, really, any minorities working in Hollywood at any level,'' he
says forcefully. ``There also doesn't seem to be much concern about
changing that.
 &HT;    ``The problem still exists,'' Cobbs says, ``and I just have to
be mindful of that and realize I'm very fortunate to be working.
But the fact that I have a job doesn't make the situation all
better.
 &HT;    ``A lot more minorities need to be working and stay working
before things start to get better,'' he adds. ``It's nice for me to
be employed, but it's not a fantastic accomplishment to be the only
black face on the show.''
 &HT;    Nearby, Melissa Crider sits on the bed in her trailer. The
actress co-stars as Satori, a New Age-ish psychic who will soon
enter into a love triangle with Marian and Mark Gabriel (Macht), an
empathic medical intern.
 &HT;    Crider's genre credits include ``Millennium'' and ``Strange
World.''
 &HT;    ``I wasn't sure I wanted to do a series,'' says Crider, a
striking combination of big blue eyes, spiky blonde hair and
contagious energy. ``I love going into a job, letting a character
live in me and then telling her `Goodbye.'
 &HT;    ``My characters would have to start paying rent if they stayed
more than a couple of months,'' she says. ``But I love Satori. I
love all the characters and this whole group of actors.
 &HT;    ``As a viewer, just based on the pilot, I feel I've known some
of the characters, or people like them, throughout my life,''
Crider says. ``I think that's all a part of my excitement.''
 &HT;    The possibility of a long run for ``The Others'' no longer
horrifies Crider.
 &HT;    ``We're dealing with a show where the sky is not the limit,''
she says. ``We're beyond the beyond.
 &HT;    ``That makes me feel we'll have enough oxygen to breathe.''

   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ I had a birthday last Monday, and
let's just say I turned the age President Clinton will be when he
leaves the White House. But that's not so bad, because he spent at
least a year acting like an 18-year-old in the Oval Office. It's
all relative, and you can be as old or young as you want to be. By

   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ Hillary Rodham Clinton popped up
on Dave Letterman's show the other night, exuding warmth and wit,
yet she refuses any substantial news interview in New York, where
she's supposed to be running for the U.S. Senate. This is bad for
democracy and it's bad for anybody who believes that people have a
right to information that will better enable them to govern
themselves. By DAN LYNCH.

IT'S NOT SO EASY TO SAY `DON'T PANIC'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: with PANIC-ATTACKS-SIDE) 
 
 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Panic'' _ the word sounds like what actually happens: an
accelerated heart beat, sweating, shortness of breath.
</P>
<P>
   For someone with panic disorder, an attack is worse than
anything we can dream up because it's precisely that person's
imagination that goes haywire.
</P>
<P>
   When she has an attack, Liz, a former executive secretary who
lives in Diamond Bar, said she develops a feeling of hyper
self-awareness. A sneeze or cough isn't just something she can
brush aside and ignore. It's something she builds upon and becomes
obsessed with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could go from this one little pain to the funeral,'' Liz
said, who asked that her last name not be used. ``The worrier part
of you escalates all these feelings that cause your anxiety
level.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA psychologist Michelle Craske characterizes hypersensitivity
as a fear of one's own body _ a prevalent theory in panic disorder
research. A person can feel a twinge, Craske said, and think
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   True panic sufferers often become convinced that they're going
crazy or that they're about to die. Attacks happen often, usually
without warning, and typically peak within 10 minutes.
Nevertheless, for panic sufferers it's 10 minutes of terror. It's
the fact that you can't predict it that differentiates panic
attacks from stage fright or other anxieties.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say the condition is probably genetic, passed
directly from parent to child, and may be the result of a chemical
imbalance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not some imaginary thing that people talk themselves
into. It's a pathological disorder,'' said Dr. John Murphy, a
Beverly Hills psychiatrist who, with his partner Dennis Munjack,
conducts clinical trials in which panic sufferers experiment with
new medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``As best we understand it, it's a chemical imbalance. But we
don't know if it's in the brain, the blood stream or the
respiratory tract.''
</P>
<P>
   After living with and studying her condition for seven years,
Liz knows all the theories and medical terminology. She recognizes
a panic attack when one is in progress. Still it can feel like ants
are crawling up her face.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son had (the condition), and that really made me sad,'' she
said. ``This is something you don't want to be passing on. This
affects my husband, my children. It's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Pasadena psychiatrist and neurologist Dr. Stuart
Shipko, 1 out of 75 people worldwide suffers from panic disorder.
Sufferers are 12 times more likely to go to hospital emergency
rooms and visit doctors 700 percent more than the general
population.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, panic even became pop-culturally trendy. We watched
fictional mob bosses played by Robert De Niro (in the film
``Analyze This'') and James Gandolfini (star of the HBO series
``The Sopranos'') visit analysts for treatment of panic attacks.
Celebrities like actress Kim Basinger and talk-show-host/singer
Donny Osmond admitted they suffered from panic and anxiety
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Shipko, who runs the Panic Disorders Institute and Web site,
said the condition is hardly a new phenomenon. He doesn't believe
doctors have treatment under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of real help for panic disorder in this country in
no way meets the demand for it,'' said Shipko. ``Personally, as a
clinician, I've been able to move really fast because of
information forwarded to me over the Internet. I've also seen a
couple of thousand people with panic disorder, and I've begun to
draw my own conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Shipko's Web site includes his theories on the link between
panic, bile flow and gastroesophageal reflux. He has also written
about extreme fluctuation in the heart rates of panic patients over
a 24-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   The site also includes a bulletin board where panic sufferers
can ask questions and exchange information. Shipko, who answers
many of the questions personally, said he has learned much from his
``citizen scientists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I lead a group of grass-roots patients who were smarter than
their doctors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Self-education helped Lori, who now helps operate Shipko's Panic
Disorders Institute Web site from her home in Laramie, Wyo. A panic
sufferer since childhood, Lori underwent years of therapy. When her
youngest son started to show symptoms of the condition, Lori began
conducting research. Now she's a health educator who is working on
a book about anxiety disorders in children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between the two of us, we give out a lot of information,''
Lori said. ``Our site isn't meant to take the place of a doctor,
but it can help you understand what questions to ask your doctor.
We reach a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep her panic under control, Liz _ who is Murphy's patient _
uses a combination of diversionary techniques and medication. But
those two approaches to panic disorder treatment _ biological and
cognitive behavioral therapy _ don't always coincide.
</P>
<P>
   Patients who visit Craske at UCLA's Anxiety Disorders Behavioral
Program, for example, will learn all about anxiety. During the 12
to 16 sessions in the program, patients learn to gain control of
their breathing and are made to confront the symptoms they
experience when suffering a panic attack. Agoraphobics are exposed
to the situations they fear _ elevators, driving or being alone _
so they learn to be less afraid. Drugs aren't part of the program,
although Craske might prescribe medication in her clinical
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Shipko said that by the time they contact the Panic Disorders
Institute, Shipko's patients are looking for a concrete medical
diagnosis _ conclusive proof that they're not crazy. And they want
the panic attacks stopped immediately, even if means starting on
medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stopping the attacks is critical,'' Shipko said. ``If you stop
the attacks, a large portion of the people will have no phobias or
depression, and they're largely able to go on with their lives as
normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors often prescribe anti-depressants, benzodiazepines (such
as Klonopin and Xanax) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)
such as phenalzine. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
such as Zoloft and Paxil are also now used to treat panic. All of
the medications have associated risks and side effects and are
potentially addictive.
</P>
<P>
   Although he believes the basic panic attack cannot be stopped by
any means except through medication, Shipko said drugs are not
necessarily required for treatment of other related symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not all black and white, that either you can control this
and pull yourself up by your bootstraps or that this is a
neurological disease that must be medicated,'' Shipko said. ``It's
not either/or, it's both.''

<P>
   If you suffer frequent panic attacks that can can wake you up
from sleep, and if these attacks are interfering with your normal
social and work habits, you probably need to see a specialist. Here
are some of the treatments:
</P>
<P>
   Cognitive-behavioral therapy: A combination of cognitive
therapy, which can modify or eliminate thought patterns
contributing to a patient's symptoms; and behavioral therapy, which
aims to help a patient change his or her behavior. A patient meets
with a therapist over a period of time in an attempt to locate the
thoughts and feelings that typically accompany a panic attack.
Often a therapist will provide the patient with simple guidelines
to follow when he or she can feel that a panic attack is
approaching.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacotherapy: Treatment with medication. A prescription
medication is used to prevent panic attacks, reduce their frequency
and severity, and to decrease anticipatory anxiety. Medications
frequently prescribed include tricyclic anti-depressants,
high-potency benzodiazepines, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MOAIs)
and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
</P>
<P>
   Psychodynamic treatments: A form of ``talk therapy'' in which a
patient and therapist seek to uncover emotional conflicts that may
be contributing to the patient's problem. By talking about these
conflicts, the patient is helped to overcome the problem. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Buying your first home can be an exercise in terror. The
alphabet soup of strange vocabulary involved in preclosing
inspections, amortization tables, RESPA statements often invites
more questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
   Ilyce R. Glink's ``100 Questions Every First-Time Home Buyer
Should Ask'' (Times Books; $17) cuts through the mess with
well-researched, straightforward answers to questions ranging from
``How do I know what I want?'' to ``How does my deed get
recorded?'' with stops at every step in between.
</P>
<P>
   There are sections on evaluating mortgage brokers and real
estate agents, finding the right financing and closing the deal.
There also are helpful sections that list everything from the Top
10 first-time home buyer mistakes to helpful Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Considering Southern Californians routinely pay $250,000 for an
average home, a $17 investment in Glink's book should pay for
itself at least 100 times, if not more. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Coca-Cola is going old school in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based cola giant is reissuing Coke in those 8-ounce
embossed glass bottles that were phased out in the 1950s. And, with
a nod to the collectibles market, Coke will be putting the names of
24 cities on the bottom of the bottles _ from Niagara Falls, N.Y.,
to Hollywood with stops in between at odd locales such as Roswell,
N.M., and Death Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Hang on to the bottles. In the early 1980s, my grandmother got
$50 for a vintage Clifton, Tenn., Coke bottle that had been
forgotten in her basement for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Georgia green'' glass bottles will be everywhere in the
near future. Next month, Coke plans to plug the new-old bottle by
giving away 1 million bottles at movie theaters, malls and ski
areas. &QL;

SKI VILLAGERS SAY THEY WON'T LEAVE GOLAN HEIGHTS IF DEAL IS MADE
WITH SYRIA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEVE ATIV, Golan Heights _ It's not yet 9 a.m., but Yitzhak
Tsuela's telephone already is ringing.
</P>
<P>
   The callers are Israelis trying to rent rooms near the ski runs
of Mount Hermon on the Golan Heights. Tsuela, the owner of a small
bed-and-breakfast inn just five minutes from the slopes, politely
turns each one away.
</P>
<P>
   Like other owners of small hotels and inns in this remote
mountain village, his inn is booked solid with vacationers from all
over Israel who want to ski, or simply to see, the glistening white
peaks before they may be returned to Syrian control as part of a
peace deal. Israel captured the strategic plateau from Syria in the
1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   Tsuela, a towering, Paul Bunyan-like man with a thick, graying
beard and muddied hiking boots, refuses even to consider the
prospect of returning the land that Israel captured from Syria in
1967. As he sees it, he will hang a `no-vacancy' sign during the
peak winter seasons for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't leave,'' he says in between taking phone calls. ``I
don't know what I'll do. Maybe, there will be war here between the
Jews. No one can know. But I won't leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Such talk is not unusual for the residents of Neve Ativ. Of the
18,000 Jewish settlers who have moved to the Golan Heights, the
ski-mountain villagers are well known for their rugged
independence.
</P>
<P>
   They developed the lucrative ski slopes, which attract nearly
250,000 visitors each season and are owned collectively by the
families of the village. Some opened restaurants, inns and other
tourist businesses that also bring in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the other enterprises on the Golan Heights _ the dairy
farms, cattle ranches and apple orchards _ the ski slopes can't be
moved or replaced.
</P>
<P>
   If the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak makes a deal with
Syrian President Hafez Assad that includes giving up the heights,
the residents of Neve Ativ may have the most to lose and likely
would refuse to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Established by a small group of men who served in an army
commando unit, the village has attracted the type of settlers who
might just as easily feel at home in the Big Sky Country of
Montana. Many are independent-thinking, well-armed outsdoorsmen who
tend to view the government with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to see the government here,'' Tsuela says. ``I
know Barak did some heroic things in the army, but we don't need
him here.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the peace talks resumed in December, Tsuela's sentiments
have been echoed by about half the Israeli public. The other half
are willing to trade land for peace. But their numbers have been
slipping, according to recent opinion polls, from 45 percent of the
public to about 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, before Barak returned from talks with the Syrians in
Shepherdstown, W.Va., more than 100,000 people gathered in Tel
Aviv's Rabin Square to protest a Golan Heights withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attribute the decline in support of giving up the Golan
Heights to a perception that Syria is more interested in acquiring
lost territory than in making peace.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, whose opening gambit in the talks reportedly included a
demand for the settlers to remain on the Golan, keeps reminding
Israelis that the talks are about substance, not style. So far,
many Israelis have been disappointed by what they see as a Syrian
cold shoulder. Israeli columnists have repeatedly noted Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa's refusal to even shake Barak's
hand.
</P>
<P>
   From his office on the ski slopes, Menachem Baruch, a resort
manager who also lives in Neve Ativ, notes with satisfaction the
absence of the handshake.
</P>
<P>
   He says it will help to persuade Israelis to vote ``no'' in a
referendum on any deal that would include a hand-over of the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israeli people are stupid and innocent,'' he says, glancing
out of his office window to watch lifts full of skiers go by. ``If
al-Sharaa would have shook Barak's hand, everything would have been
different. We would have been finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now, the referendum won't pass,'' he says. ``They can pass
it politically (in the Parliament), but when it comes to a
referendum, the people won't accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   Baruch says he is encouraged because many Israelis dislike the
notion of relinquishing a plateau full of hiking trails, waterfalls
and the country's only ski resort. But outside in the ski lounge,
some of the visitors sipping hot chocolate on cold wooden benches
say they still believe peace with Syria would mean giving the land
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad but we're happy there will be peace,'' says Ronni
Vardi, a marketing analyst from a town north of Tel Aviv who came
to show his two children the snow.
</P>
<P>
   Gesturing to his children, he says, ``Their not being soldiers
is the most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's government has promised that soldiers serving in Lebanon
would be brought home once peace is made with Syria. ``I'm worried
(about giving up land),'' says Vardi, ``but I'm more worried about
the soldiers. It's houses or life, and life is more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many residents of Neve Ativ, Tsuela, the innkeeper, scoffs
at such talk. He sees no connection between Israel giving up the
Golan Heights and withdrawing from southern Lebanon. He says any
link between the Golan and southern Lebanon, where Israeli troops
are fighting a war of attrition against Lebanese guerrillas, was
fabricated by the government as part of a ``psychological war''
against the Golan settlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had eight years of psychological battle,'' he says,
referring to the time since late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin took
office in 1992. ``From Rabin until now, we have been told we will
leave here. It's like brainwashing.''
</P>
<P>
   When Tsuela moved to Neve Ativ in 1971, he had just left an
Israeli army commando unit responsible for ambushing Arab
guerrillas, sometimes behind enemy lines. Four of the men from his
unit were killed in combat. ``Ativ'' is an acronym derived from
their first names.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Tsuela lived in a tiny bunkerlike house built with
reinforced concrete and steel. After spending years of working on
the ski slopes and in his inn as well as designing cable cars, he
has expanded his small home into a sprawling residence with the inn
out front and a wine cellar in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   Life in Neve Ativ, he says, was never meant for the
faint-hearted, the ``vegetarians,'' he calls them. Those who made
it this far, he says, are here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the people here were weak, they wouldn't have been here for
so long,'' he says, slapping the concrete walls to emphasize his
words. ``We're still here. We're not going anywhere.''

ANGLESEA, Australia: ready for exercise.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 55,000-acre Angahook-Lorne State Park dominates this area,
and more than 30 miles of well-maintained trails encourage hiking _
bushwalking, in Aussie lingo _ through forested valleys teeming
with wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Waterfalls are especially riveting; the most popular is Erskine
Falls, which cascades almost 100 feet into a lovely tree-lined
gully. It's a short drive from Lorne, and an overlook is a
five-minute walk from the car park. Ambitious visitors take steps
to the base of the falls for a closer view.
</P>
<P>
   More bushwalks and waterfalls prove inviting as the route
continues westward toward the communities of Wye River, Kennett
River, Skenes Creek and Apollo Bay. Even from your car, this is one
of the most tantalizing segments of the road, at times rising high
above the sea.
</P>
<P>
   A good perspective is available from Mariner's Lookout above
Apollo Bay. The drive from town takes only a minute or two, but a
steep walk from the car park is required to enjoy the most sweeping
views.
</P>
<P>
   Back at sea level, Apollo Bay offers a welcome midday respite
before you tackle even higher adventure. With a population of
1,000, it's sleepier than Lorne but has a down-home charm and an
idyllic setting.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea-Grape, along the highway, serves the freshest of seafood
caught just off shore. Crayfish (resembling lobster more than our
crawfish) and whiting are among specialties, and
shrimp-and-asparagus risotto is a delectable bargain at $7 U.S.
Dining outside here on a sunny, breezy day seems almost sinful.
</P>
<P>
   You'll need ample sustenance, and good walking shoes, as the
afternoon progresses because the fun is only beginning.
</P>
<P>
   For practical purposes, the Great Ocean Road becomes the Great
Inland Road after Apollo Bay, weaving through the heart of
32,500-acre Otway National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Pause at the Maits Rest Rainforest Walk (named for forestry
officer Maitland Bryant, who rested his horse here during patrols).
A 45-minute self-guided trek on boards and footbridges winds
beneath a deep-green canopy of myrtle and beech trees, some 300
years old, surrounded by sheltering ferns. More than 250 bird
species have been spotted here.
</P>
<P>
   Next, drive two miles west, turn left on Otway Lighthouse Road
and detour for about 15 minutes to Cape Otway. It's not uncommon to
spot wallabies en route.
</P>
<P>
   The Cape Otway Lighthouse, oldest on the mainland, dates to
1848. For a small fee _ and a 10-minute walk _ visitors can tour
the lighthouse, climb a narrow staircase to its summit and step
onto a balcony from which the Shipwreck Coast is on grand display.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the Great Ocean Road, the route continues northwest.
Before you reach Lavers Hill, once the center of a thriving timber
industry, you'll see the turnoff to beautiful Johanna Beach. Just
after Lavers Hill comes Melba Gully State Park, which rivals Maits
Rest.
</P>
<P>
   By now, however, the sun likely is dipping fast. So take
advantage of the mostly straight route back to the sea, where
arguably the most remarkable scenery remains to be witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   Port Campbell National Park extends for 17 miles along a
shoreline guarded by scores of dazzling rock formations. You'll
pass the Twelve Apostles just before reaching the small township of
Port Campbell. If sunset is approaching, pull off the road, park,
walk onto a wide viewing platform and prepare to be enthralled.
</P>
<P>
   But for a better understanding of the history behind these
monuments, plan to return the next morning. Port Campbell, a good
choice for lodging, goes to sleep early. Don't miss out on tiger
prawns in sweet chili sauce at the Southern Ocean Motor Inn's
Napiers Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DAY 3: TO PORT FAIRY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Shipwreck Coast is so named because almost 200 vessels and
hundreds of lives have been lost as treacherous windblown seas
pounded vessels into the craggy shore.
</P>
<P>
   The same elements have created the landscape. Sheer limestone
cliffs, some millions of years old and towering 225 feet above the
ocean, are subjected to a fierce attack by waves and tides. Erosion
has shaped the rock into a series of stacks, gorges, arches and
blowholes.
</P>
<P>
   Best-known are the Twelves Apostles, whose tallest rock stack
soars to 165 feet. They are mesmerizing at sunset and in early
morning as you face the west from the viewing platform with the sun
rising behind your shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   But what's this? Only seven rocks. Seven Apostles?
</P>
<P>
   One theory holds that erosion has washed away the other
boulders. Another suggests that the person responsible for the name
was a tad tipsy at the time.
</P>
<P>
   About a mile to the west, back toward Port Campbell, the Loch
Ard Gorge provides more insight and a bit of lore.
</P>
<P>
   Here, on a misty, windy May evening in 1878, 52 lives were lost
when the Loch Ard, a vessel nearing the end of a 90-day voyage from
London, was swept into the cliffs. Only two 18-year-olds survived:
midshipman Tom Pearce and Eva Carmichael, who was traveling with
her parents and six siblings. According to legend, Tom swam to
safety, then heard nonswimmer Eva's screams as she clung to rocks
at the edge of the gorge. He returned to rescue her, and the two
became folk heroes throughout Australia (though not the romantic
couple many had hoped for).
</P>
<P>
   Only four bodies were found, including that of Eva's mother;
they are buried in a small cemetery overlooking the gorge.
</P>
<P>
   Three walking trails have been developed, with exhibits and
signposts focusing on the Loch Ard tragedy, geology and wildlife.
Birders delight in spotting the rare rufous bristlebird, and nearby
Muttonbird Island is a nesting site for the short-tailed shearwater
in summer (our winter) and the black-faced cormorant in winter.
</P>
<P>
   West of Port Campbell, dozens more rock formations are
distinctive in appearance. One, known as London Bridge, gained
notoriety 10 years ago when a connecting arch to the mainland
crashed into the sea, stranding two people. (They were rescued by
helicopter.)
</P>
<P>
   Paved lookouts near the roadway afford close inspection of
London Bridge and nearby formations known as the Arch and the
Grotto. At the Grotto, paths lead to rock pools.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Ocean Road ends when it merges with Highway A1 near
Allansford, about a half-hour drive past Port Campbell. But as at
the beginning, treasures extend beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Warrnambool, 15 minutes farther, seems huge with its 30,000
residents, street lights and _ reality check _ McDonald's
restaurants. But this seaside city allows pause for reflection,
especially at its Flagstaff Hill Maritime Museum, whose focus is
Shipwreck Coast history.
</P>
<P>
   Between May and October, female southern right whales migrate
from the subantarctic to calve in ``nursery'' areas just off
Warrnambool's Logan Beach. They often swim within 100 yards of the
shore and can be observed from a platform in the dunes or from the
beach. (Males and young females stay farther out to sea.)
</P>
<P>
   One last specialty meal is in order here. While not the ritziest
place in town, Fishtales Cafe serves an eclectic array of 12
pastas, 25 burgers and five Thai green curries. Among the
sandwiches are an Arab Burger (with lettuce, tomato, spicy
eggplant, meat, sambal, burned onions and aioli), an Irish Fish
Burger, a Falafel Burger, a Lentil Burger and a Cajun Burger.
</P>
<P>
   Between Warrnambool and the pretty fishing village of Port
Fairy, a one-way loop road winds through Tower Hill State Game
Reserve, whose setting in an extinct volcano allows kangaroos,
koalas, emus and water birds to roam freely and often within clear
view.
</P>
<P>
   Point Fairy, once one of Australia's most important seaports,
retains its colonial architecture and provides an enchanting
conclusion to the three-day excursion.
</P>
<P>
   Backtracking? Not necessary, except as far as Allansford. From
there, express highways get you to Melbourne in three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, that is, you want to play one more round of golf with
the kangaroos.

<P>
   ANGLESEA, Australia _ As the foursome arrived at the Anglesea
Golf Club's 10th tee, the first to play reached into his bag and
selected a club.
</P>
<P>
   He took a practice swing, then surveyed the course for hazards.
No, not a creek or ravine. Not a sand bunker. Living, moving
hazards.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 yards ahead, half a dozen kangaroos hopped across the
fairway. Twenty or more 'roos chowed down in _ no, on the right
rough. Others napped beneath gum trees to the left.
</P>
<P>
   From the edge of the tee box _ barely 10 feet away _ a lone
kangaroo stared ahead so intently that an observer could easily
imagine its wanting to advise: ``Scrap the driver for a 2-wood.
Trust me; I live here.''
</P>
<P>
   Once each golfer had taken his turn, the animal hopped away, not
bothering to say whether it was impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Even for nongolfers, visiting the Anglesea Golf Club _ where
more than 1,000 eastern gray kangaroos reside in a native bushland
setting _ is a highlight of an excursion along Australia's Great
Ocean Road.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of many highlights.
</P>
<P>
   From Maine to Oregon, the United States is blessed with wondrous
scenic roadways beside its seas. But only here, at the southern tip
of mainland Australia in the state of Victoria, can you play with
the 'roos and pray with the apostles.
</P>
<P>
   The Twelve Apostles is a name accorded the most celebrated of
several spectacular rock formations carved out of soft limestone
headland by crashing ocean waves. The sculptures rise from the sea
to guard the Shipwreck Coast, one segment of the Great Ocean Road.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the 155-mile road (B100), which begins about an hour's
drive west of Melbourne, introduces treasures so appealing and
diverse that the biggest challenge is determining where to allow
the most time.
</P>
<P>
   Test (or simply admire) waves of 15-20 feet at Bells Beach,
mecca for Australian surfers. Spy for whales near the small city of
Warrnambool or for multicolored parrots and cockatoos during a
leisurely bushwalk in a national or state park. Climb to the top of
150-year-old Cape Otway Lighthouse and savor panoramic vistas.
Discover a sandy beach for sunning, swimming and, if you pick the
right spot, blissful solitude.
</P>
<P>
   Don't skip mealtime, either. For lunch, choose a sun-drenched
sidewalk table at the Sea-Grape in the typically enchanting coastal
hamlet of Apollo Bay. As you linger over the menu, chances are an
amiable Aussie will mosey past and whisper: ``G'day, mate. Here's a
tip: You can't go wrong with the local whiting fillets.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's right.
</P>
<P>
   Appetite whetted? Let's take a tour. Although it's possible to
traverse the Great Ocean Road in one frantic day, don't make that
mistake. You could easily spend a week here. But given all the
other sights to see on this continent, compromise is essential.
</P>
<P>
   We'll settle for three days. Keep your camera within arm's
reach. And be prepared to brake for 'roos and wallabies.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DAY 1: MELBOURNE TO LORNE &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Great Ocean Road is a tribute to Aussie spirit, dedicated to
those who perished in World War I and constructed largely by
thousands of ex-servicemen during a 15-year period beginning in
1918.
</P>
<P>
   The two-lane highway is paved throughout. A few stretches bend
and climb dramatically and hug the sea, recalling California's
Highway 1 near Big Sur. But other segments veer inland for miles
and include long straightaways. At one moment the road is
surrounded by rain forests, at another by rolling pastures, at
still another by rugged cliffs and tranquil coves.
</P>
<P>
   The first requisite for exploration is a vehicle. Renting a car
at Melbourne Airport is neither complicated nor expensive.
U.S.-based firms are represented. Specify if you desire a car with
automatic transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Like Britons, Australians drive on the left side of the road;
the driver sits on the right side of the car. Most folks quickly
get the hang of it. Just keep your cool when the windshield wipers
activate each time you think you're signaling a turn.
</P>
<P>
   Follow the Princess Highway (M1) southwest from Melbourne to
Geelong (a 45-minute drive), where two stops are recommended before
you get on the Great Ocean Road.
</P>
<P>
   One is the Geelong Otway Region tourism office, about five miles
east of town, whose staff can provide free brochures and advice.
</P>
<P>
   The other is the waterfront _ facing Corio Bay, not the ocean _
in downtown Geelong. Its decor includes more than 100 brightly
painted bollards, wooden sculptures that depict characters from the
city's past and modern-day community figures such as police
officers, lifeguards, football players and fishermen. Nearby is the
National Wool Museum.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-minute drive south leads to Torquay, Australia's ``Surf
City'' and eastern gateway to the Great Ocean Road. Many of the
world's best-known surfing-industry manufacturers are represented
here, and the Surfworld Australia museum honors the sport's
pioneers and more recent stars.
</P>
<P>
   Just past Torquay, signs point the way to Bells Beach. Even if
you aren't inclined to ride the waves, easily accessed platforms
high above the sea allow stellar views. Other area beaches, better
protected from ocean swells, are ideal for swimming.
</P>
<P>
   Continue 20 minutes to the west and you'll be in Anglesea, a
village whose 2,000 human residents generate less attention than
its kangaroos.
</P>
<P>
   Don't fret about formalities at the Anglesea Golf Club. Members
are as accustomed to dealing with wide-eyed tourists as to playing
amid the 'roos. Though a private club, Anglesea welcomes guests;
greens fees for 18 holes are only $17 U.S., for nine holes about
$10.
</P>
<P>
   Kangaroos are usually visible from streets around the course
(about half a mile off the Great Ocean Road). They are particularly
active near sunset; park along Golf Links Drive, and you're likely
to see as many as 100 'roos grazing on fairways and greens, even as
golfers approach to putt. During sunny periods, the animals often
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Anglesea member Kevin Sadler says he's never seen a
kangaroo get hurt. ``We were getting set to tee off one day, and a
big herd of kangaroos was directly in front of us,'' Sadler
recalls. ``I said, `Maybe we should play around them,' and my
partners said, `No, go ahead.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I teed off, and the ball went directly at a kangaroo. It just
ducked its head, and the ball sailed right above. Pretty smart
'roo, right?'''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on bluffs overlooking the ocean, Anglesea also is
notable as a center for hang-gliding. Several motels beckon, but
press on for another half hour to Lorne. You'll endure dozens of
twists and turns and temptations to pause at overlooks, but the
reward for perseverance is an evening in the Great Ocean Road's
only resort community.
</P>
<P>
   Compact Lorne, on the shores of Loutit Bay, isn't fancy and has
only about 1,500 permanent residents. But during peak tourist
periods, it bursts with activity. Mountjoy Parade, a wide
beach-front boulevard lined with restaurants, cafes and boutiques,
offers a Mediterranean flair. Comfortable and inexpensive lodging
is available near the water.
</P>
<P>
   Whether your evening repast features a Greek salad, Tasmanian
salmon or a Szechwan stir-fry, a late-evening seaside stroll is the
perfect ending to an eventful day.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DAY 2: TO PORT CAMPBELL &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How about a picnic breakfast to jump-start the journey's second
leg? Visit a European-style bakery/deli along Mountjoy Parade, then
adjourn to a gently sloping hillside just west of town overlooking
gentle waves leading to sandy beaches leading to rich green forest.
Rudyard Kipling was so inspired that he wrote about Lorne in his
poem ``Flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   Now get ready for exercise.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   .....................
</P>
<P>
   JACKI LYDEN: Long before the world knew of Elian Gonzalez, there
was another 6-year-old Cuban boy, who also found himself in the
middle of two battling forces. He was known as ``Fidelito'' _
actually Felix Fidel Castro Diaz _ and he was the young son of a
rebel fighter named Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins in 1954 when Castro was imprisoned by the same
Cuban government he overthrew five years later _ the regime of
President Fulgencio Batista. While in jail, Castro learned that he
was about to lose his son in a divorce case and that the boy,
Fidelito, might be taken from the country.
</P>
<P>
   ANN LOUISE BARDACH: Yes, Castro had been imprisoned after his
failed attack (in 1953) upon the Moncada military garrison (in
Santiago), and his wife at that time was Mirta Diaz-Balart. Mirta
informed Fidel Castro she wanted a divorce and that she would be
leaving the country with their 6-year-old son, Fidelito Castro.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: The age is even the same (as Elian Gonzalez').
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: Yes, and Castro took this news very badly. He went into
an incendiary rage: Not only was he going to be losing his wife
with his beloved, cherished only child at that point, but also
Mirta's family was connected to the Batista regime and had strong
U.S. ``Yankee'' connections.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: His worst nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: So Castro wrote a letter to his sister, Lydia, from
prison, and I quote: ``I refuse even to think that my son may sleep
a single night under the same roof sheltering my most repulsive
enemies and receive on his innocent cheeks the kisses of those
miserable Judases.'' Later he would write to her: ``To take this
child away from me, they would have to kill me. I lose my head when
I think about these things.''
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: And indeed, Mirta does take their son to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: It speaks volumes about Fidel Castro's character. He
was in a political situation where, at any time Batista, had he
chosen to, could arrange an accident in which Castro would
``disappear.'' Castro was in no position to be making any demands
whatsoever and yet makes an unprecedented custody demand. And
again, we're talking about 1954, when men were not commonly known
to be asking for custody of their children.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: Who were the ``miserable Judases'' Castro was referring
to, his enemies?
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: Oh, the ``miserable Judases'' are the Diaz-Balarts,
Mirta's family. Her brother was Rafael Diaz-Balart, an official in
the Batista government and, at one time, a very close friend of
Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: When Castro was finally released from prison, he was
determined to get his son back. What happens next?
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: Castro did lose the first round. Mirta was able to get
a divorce and custody of the boy, or at least a temporary order. In
fact, she went off to the United States with their son. After his
release, Castro and his brother (Raul), who was in prison with him,
and his rebel supporters realized it was too dangerous to stay in
Cuba. So they went to Mexico, where Castro then plotted two
strategies. One, of course, was his triumphant return to Cuba (in
1959), and the second was how he was going to get Fidelito back.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: So what was Castro's strategy to get the boy back?
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: Fidel Castro, by tricking his wife Mirta, essentially,
convinces her to send Fidelito to him. Castro was arguing that it
could be the last time he ever sees his son because he's about to
begin a perilous expedition _ of course, returning to Cuba to start
a revolution. And Mirta buys this and she sends back Fidelito. But
after two weeks' time, the son is not returned.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: Castro keeps him.
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: Castro installs his son, Fidelito, with a couple (who
live in Mexico). And with that, Mirta Diaz-Balart becomes
absolutely distraught. She was from a politically powerful family,
and through the agents of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico, they arrange
to retain three men who follow young Fidelito.
</P>
<P>
   These men accost the boy as he walks through the park with Fidel
Castro's older sisters in Mexico. On their way back home to the
house where the boy was staying, a car literally cuts them off in
the middle of the street. The men jump out of the car; they seize
the boy and return him to the mother.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: Yet somehow, eventually, after the revolution is
successful, Fidel Castro convinces his ex-wife to send the boy back
down to Cuba, back down to Havana.
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: In fact, Mirta brings him back. Castro takes control of
the country Jan. 1, 1959. You know, Batista flees with the national
treasury and goes into exile. And, of course, Castro then promptly
arranges for his son to be returned to Cuba, and his son is flown
down from the United States with Mirta and is reunited with his
father. From that point on, Castro has the dominant control over
Fidelito.
</P>
<P>
   Later in life, Fidelito is sent to the Soviet Union _ what is
Russia today _ and was educated. He studied to be a physicist. (He
studied nuclear engineering in Moscow and in 1981 became director
of Cuba's Atomic Energy Commission). At one point he married a
Russian woman. Now his second wife is a Cuban woman. He lives in
Havana and has three children.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: Do most people know the story of this custody battle 50
years ago?
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: No, most people don't, unless they've been reading the
letters from Castro in prison or several of the biographies that
allude to them. But most people (don't know of the parallels
between the cases of Fidelito and Elian Gonzalez), not in Cuba and
not in Miami.

informed Fidel Castro she wanted a divorce and that she would be
leaving the country with their 6-year-old son, Fidelito Castro.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: The age is even the same (as Elian Gonzalez').
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: Yes, and Castro took this news very badly. He went into
an incendiary rage: Not only was he going to be losing his wife
with his beloved, cherished only child at that point, but also
Mirta's family was connected to the Batista regime and had strong
U.S. ``Yankee'' connections.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: His worst nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: So Castro wrote a letter to his sister, Lydia, from
prison, and I quote: ``I refuse even to think that my son may sleep
a single night under the same roof sheltering my most repulsive
enemies and receive on his innocent cheeks the kisses of those
miserable Judases.'' Later he would write to her: ``To take this
child away from me, they would have to kill me. I lose my head when
I think about these things.''
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: And indeed, Mirta does take their son to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: It speaks volumes about Fidel Castro's character. He
was in a political situation where, at any time Batista, had he
chosen to, could arrange an accident in which Castro would
``disappear.'' Castro was in no position to be making any demands
whatsoever and yet makes an unprecedented custody demand. And
again, we're talking about 1954, when men were not commonly known
to be asking for custody of their children.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: Who were the ``miserable Judases'' Castro was referring
to, his enemies?
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: Oh, the ``miserable Judases'' are the Diaz-Balarts,
Mirta's family. Her brother was Rafael Diaz-Balart, an official in
the Batista government and, at one time, a very close friend of
Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: When Castro was finally released from prison, he was
determined to get his son back. What happens next?
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: Castro did lose the first round. Mirta was able to get
a divorce and custody of the boy, or at least a temporary order. In
fact, she went off to the United States with their son. After his
release, Castro and his brother (Raul), who was in prison with him,
and his rebel supporters realized it was too dangerous to stay in
Cuba. So they went to Mexico, where Castro then plotted two
strategies. One, of course, was his triumphant return to Cuba (in
1959), and the second was how he was going to get Fidelito back.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: So what was Castro's strategy to get the boy back?
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: Fidel Castro, by tricking his wife Mirta, essentially,
convinces her to send Fidelito to him. Castro was arguing that it
could be the last time he ever sees his son because he's about to
begin a perilous expedition _ of course, returning to Cuba to start
a revolution. And Mirta buys this and she sends back Fidelito. But
after two weeks' time, the son is not returned.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: Castro keeps him.
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: Castro installs his son, Fidelito, with a couple (who
live in Mexico). And with that, Mirta Diaz-Balart becomes
absolutely distraught. She was from a politically powerful family,
and through the agents of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico, they arrange
to retain three men who follow young Fidelito.
</P>
<P>
   These men accost the boy as he walks through the park with Fidel
Castro's older sisters in Mexico. On their way back home to the
house where the boy was staying, a car literally cuts them off in
the middle of the street. The men jump out of the car; they seize
the boy and return him to the mother.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: Yet somehow, eventually, after the revolution is
successful, Fidel Castro convinces his ex-wife to send the boy back
down to Cuba, back down to Havana.
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: In fact, Mirta brings him back. Castro takes control of
the country Jan. 1, 1959. You know, Batista flees with the national
treasury and goes into exile. And, of course, Castro then promptly
arranges for his son to be returned to Cuba, and his son is flown
down from the United States with Mirta and is reunited with his
father. From that point on, Castro has the dominant control over
Fidelito.
</P>
<P>
   Later in life, Fidelito is sent to the Soviet Union _ what is
Russia today _ and was educated. He studied to be a physicist. (He
studied nuclear engineering in Moscow and in 1981 became director
of Cuba's Atomic Energy Commission). At one point he married a
Russian woman. Now his second wife is a Cuban woman. He lives in
Havana and has three children.
</P>
<P>
   LYDEN: Do most people know the story of this custody battle 50
years ago?
</P>
<P>
   BARDACH: No, most people don't, unless they've been reading the
letters from Castro in prison or several of the biographies that
allude to them. But most people (don't know of the parallels
between the cases of Fidelito and Elian Gonzalez), not in Cuba and
not in Miami.

<P>
   Qantas offers sharp discounts on flights within Australia when
combined with an international ticket. Contact a travel agent for
details. Air New Zealand operates a similar program in conjunction
with Ansett Australia airlines.
</P>
<P>
   _ When to go: Australia's seasons are reversed from those in the
United States, but the climate is mild year-round along the Great
Ocean Road. Hotel accommodations are hard to acquire in December,
January and other holiday periods. Advance reservations are advised
for any weekend.
</P>
<P>
   _ Packages: Several companies can arrange packages that feature

</P>
<P>
   _ Lodging: We stayed at the Lorne Main Beach Motor Inn in Lorne
and the Southern Ocean Motor Inn in Port Campbell. Both are
affiliated with Australia's Flag Hotels chain, and arrangements
were made through Austravel. While not luxurious, the properties
were comfortable and well-maintained with costs less than $100 U.S.
for a double room. The Southern Ocean Motor Inn featured Port
Campbell's best restaurant; eateries and shops were only a short
walk from the Lorne Main Beach Motor Inn.
</P>
<P>
   Other lodgings are available en route, and a travel agent can
offer options.
</P>
<P>
   _ Documentation: A valid U.S. passport and an Australian visa
are required. But unlike in some countries, a visa costs nothing
and is easy to acquire. It's processed electronically, so you don't
have to carry a document. A travel agent or tour packager can
handle details. The visa is valid for up to three months in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   _ Currency: The Australian dollar has been trading at about
$1.53 to $1 U.S.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clothing: Casual attire is appropriate throughout the region.
Evenings can become chilly; a sweater or light jacket is
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   _ Time: The state of Victoria is 15 hours ahead of Houston. If
it's 9 a.m. Sunday along the Great Ocean Road, it's 6 p.m. Saturday
in Houston.

MAKE THE MOST OF LIMITED TIME 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most travelers have felt the quandary: Too much to see. Too
little time.
</P>
<P>
   If only I had a penny for every cruise passenger who, after one
hectic day in a port, sighed wistfully, ``I only scratched the
surface; I must come back and stay a week.''
</P>
<P>
   And while ``If it's Tuesday, this must be Belgium,'' bus tours
can provide grand overviews, Brussels, Paris and Amsterdam too
frequently fade into one big blur at the end of the road.
</P>
<P>
   My predicament last summer involved Melbourne, Australia's
second-largest city _ and a strong rival to Sydney in its
cosmopolitan appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable allowed two weeks on a continent about the size of
the United States. And this was my first visit.
</P>
<P>
   I can only imagine the difficulty a first-time traveler to our
country endures in organizing a two-week _ or two-month _ vacation.
How could you skip New York? Washington, D.C.? Philadelphia? What
about San Francisco? Hollywood? The Pacific Coast Highway?
Yellowstone National Park? The Rocky Mountains? New Orleans' French
Quarter? Space centers in Houston and Florida? Walt Disney World?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SETTING PRIORITIES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to Australia, I targeted Sydney as a must. In
almost every survey travelers name Sydney their favorite
destination worldwide, and the 2000 Olympics (Sept. 15-Oct. 1) will
shine an even brighter spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Barrier Reef represents one of the world's premier
natural wonders, and how could I resist spying for birds and
butterflies _ and crocodiles _ elsewhere in Queensland? Touring the
Great Ocean Road in Victoria not only introduces spectacular
scenery but provides an appreciation for diverse outdoor wonders.
So I penciled each into the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving home, I reluctantly conceded that the Outback
must be saved for another visit. Kangaroo Island and Tasmania, too.
And Perth on Australia's west coast.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PLANNING FOR MELBOURNE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But what about Melbourne? I was utilizing the city as a gateway
for the Great Ocean Road. I could squeeze in one day _ a Sunday _
but was that fair? To me or Melbourne?
</P>
<P>
   Reasoning that others may face a similar dilemma while
scheduling side trips during the Olympics, I decided to go for it.
And I followed a philosophy that has worked for me in similar
situations.
</P>
<P>
   First, I secured a map of the city's public transportation
system. Old-fashioned trams _ efficient and fun _ access most
Melbourne districts. On one route, trams continually circle the
inner city at approximate five-minute intervals and cost nothing. A
small charge allows exploration of other attractions.
</P>
<P>
   I hopped on the circular tram first. And wherever the spirit was
moved _ at the State Library, the ornate and historical Palace
Theater, lovely Parliament Gardens, the towering spire of St.
Patrick's Cathedral _ I hopped off. And on again.
</P>
<P>
   After gaining an orientation, I began weaving on foot through
the heart of the city. To the Block Arcade, central Melbourne's
most opulent shopping complex. To a small music store where I
invested in two CDs featuring a favorite Aussie singer _ recordings
unavailable at home. To Chinatown for a scrumptious lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Tram No. 8 helped me fulfill another objective. I've usually
found that the pulse of a city _ and its people _ is best felt in
its public parks and gardens. Melbourne laws require that
one-fourth of all area be ``green,'' and open spaces abound in all
directions, none more prized that the Royal Botanic Gardens. More
than 50,000 plants and scores of bird species and animals thrive in
a peaceful oasis dotted with lakes and ponds, beautifully manicured
lawns and walking trails.
</P>
<P>
   As a bonus, Tram 8 also stopped at the National Gallery of
Victoria and Victorian Arts Center.
</P>
<P>
   Come evening, another kind of exploration awaited. The Colonial
Tramcar Restaurant _ an elegantly refurbished 1927 tram _ cruises
Melbourne suburbs while passengers feast on pepper crusted
kangaroo, Tasmanian salmon, ginger-spiced chicken, and apple and
cinnamon crepes.
</P>
<P>
   A few steps from my hotel headquarters _ the Centra Melbourne,
situated along the Yarra River and convenient to trams and
restaurants _ a sparkling new entertainment center proved an ideal
location to wind down after dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Fulfilling? Yes. But I was left longing for more. Especially
when a new acquaintance said, ``Too bad you didn't make it to an
Australian rules football game.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe next time. It's the traveler's lament.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (For release: Jan. 16 or thereafter)  
 &HT;    Like so many Americans, I first met Martin Luther King Jr. on
television. I was 9. He was dead.
 &HT;    ``Martin Luther King Jr. has just been shot in Memphis, Tenn.,''
the news bulletin announced.
 &HT;    I was sitting on the living-room floor watching a Western with
my father. As my mother joined us, the camera switched to King's
last speech.
 &HT;    ``We've got some difficult days ahead,'' King said as he peered
intensely at his throng of followers.
 &HT;    ``But it really doesn't matter with me now, because I've been to
the mountaintop.'' The audience erupted in cheers and with shouts
of ``Oh, yes!'' ``Go 'head!'' and ``Yes, sir!''
 &HT;    Before the applause subsided, he continued: ``Like anybody, I'd
like to live a long life. But lon-ge-vi-ty has its place.'' He
paused, deliberately letting the audience's cries ratchet up the
emotional pitch of his rhetoric. By now, I had goose bumps all over
my body.
 &HT;    ``I may not get there with you,'' he said, reaching his
thrilling climax. ``But I want you to know tonight that we as a
people will get to the promised land.''
 &HT;    That was the image of King that was scorched into my brain: a
Christlike leader who prophesied his people's redemption and his
own imminent martyrdom in the same breath. Countless books and
articles portrayed him as the Prince of Peace, an American Gandhi,
a latter-day Jefferson or Lincoln.
 &HT;    Schoolteachers extolled him as the superhuman ideal of eloquence
and restraint toward which all black people should strive. As his
talents were celebrated again and again, an official story began to
fall into place: King had been a humble minister who pricked
America's conscience, and America had responded by eagerly righting
all its historical wrongs.
 &HT;    It was a compelling story, but more than that, it was a useful
story. For millions of blacks, his saintly stature enhanced their
collective moral standing. For many whites, his public canonization
relieved their otherwise troubled racial conscience.
 &HT;    And for a fragmented nation still reeling from the social
upheavals of the 1960s, his public acclaim afforded a rare moment
of healing consensus.
 &HT;    But the hagiography of King harbored a distinct political
morality. In the name of unity, the official story silenced the
more radical aspects of King's challenge _ his advocacy of racial
compensation, his attempt to destroy poverty, his democratic
socialist beliefs, his opposition to the Vietnam War. And it
whitewashed the painful truth that America had harshly resisted his
call to do the right thing.
 &HT;    Most of all, it placed him far beyond the reach of mere mortals.
His flesh-and-blood struggles _ and failures _ became easily
dismissed as mere preamble to his inevitable ascension. And the
courageous role played by ordinary black folks and their supporters
was forgotten altogether.
 &HT;    I first started to question the official representation when, as
a 19-year-old minister in training, I heard whispers about King's
rampant womanizing.
 &HT;    Then in the late '80s, I discovered that one of King's sermons,
``Remaining Awake Through a Great Revolution,'' strongly resembled
the sermon of a white minister, Halford Luccock, that had been
published many years earlier.
 &HT;    King's adulterous liaisons eventually came into fuller view with
the publication of ``Bearing the Cross,'' by David Garrow, and
``Parting the Waters,'' by Taylor Branch; Keith Miller later
explored King's plagiarism at great length in his well-publicized
book, ``Voice of Deliverance.''
 &HT;    The awestruck 9-year-old I once was would have been horrified by
these facts, but as I became more conscious of my own moral lapses
and hypocrisies, I found them deeply moving. I felt that for the
first time I was able to grasp what King accomplished in its true
proportions.
 &HT;    When I shared these revelations with others, however _ in
publications and speeches in observance of his holiday _ I
encountered tremendous resistance.
 &HT;    Of course, it's easy to understand why black people are
suspicious of anyone who claims the need to scrutinize King: He was
torn apart in life, so shouldn't he be protected in death? But
protecting him from critical inquiry preserves his image at the
expense of his message.
 &HT;    Consider his current political fortunes. Since his elevation to
the position of national saint, his bowdlerized legacy has been up
for grabs by any and all. On the 1997 anniversary of King's birth,
Ward Connerly, the black conservative, opened his national campaign
against affirmative action by invoking (out of context) King's wish
for his children not to be judged by the ``color of their skin but
by the content of their character.''
 &HT;    This despite the fact that King advocated ``special,
compensatory measures which could be regarded as a settlement'' for
the ``exploitation and humiliation of the Negro in America down
through the centuries.''
 &HT;    Indeed, his image has been appropriated in electoral bids,
hip-hop songs, church sermons and fast-food ads _ of such diverse
and contradictory meanings that he couldn't possibly have approved
of all of them.
 &HT;    Worse yet, investing in King's perfection allows us to dismiss
the humanity of the underregarded, like many beleaguered black
youth, whose violence-drenched culture is said to prove their
distance from King's stature and dream.
 &HT;    King's real danger to American society is buried in all these
romantic portrayals; after all, he wasn't killed for preaching
nonviolence. With a more nuanced view of King in play, we should be
inspired to create social change in our own communities, armed with
the belief that good things can be done by imperfect people. It is
to our national advantage to recuperate the King who tested
America's mettle by challenging us to live right.
 &HT;    And it would benefit us personally to grasp hold of a King whose
blotches and brilliance live on the same block, if for no other
reason than to destroy the self-righteousness that King so rightly
deplored.

paused, deliberately letting the audience's cries ratchet up the
emotional pitch of his rhetoric. By now, I had goose bumps all over
my body.
 &HT;    ``I may not get there with you,'' he said, reaching his
thrilling climax. ``But I want you to know tonight that we as a
people will get to the promised land.''
 &HT;    That was the image of King that was scorched into my brain: a
Christlike leader who prophesied his people's redemption and his
own imminent martyrdom in the same breath. Countless books and
articles portrayed him as the Prince of Peace, an American Gandhi,
a latter-day Jefferson or Lincoln.
 &HT;    Schoolteachers extolled him as the superhuman ideal of eloquence
and restraint toward which all black people should strive. As his
talents were celebrated again and again, an official story began to
fall into place: King had been a humble minister who pricked
America's conscience, and America had responded by eagerly righting
all its historical wrongs.
 &HT;    It was a compelling story, but more than that, it was a useful
story. For millions of blacks, his saintly stature enhanced their
collective moral standing. For many whites, his public canonization
relieved their otherwise troubled racial conscience.
 &HT;    And for a fragmented nation still reeling from the social
upheavals of the 1960s, his public acclaim afforded a rare moment
of healing consensus.
 &HT;    But the hagiography of King harbored a distinct political
morality. In the name of unity, the official story silenced the
more radical aspects of King's challenge _ his advocacy of racial
compensation, his attempt to destroy poverty, his democratic
socialist beliefs, his opposition to the Vietnam War. And it
whitewashed the painful truth that America had harshly resisted his
call to do the right thing.
 &HT;    Most of all, it placed him far beyond the reach of mere mortals.
His flesh-and-blood struggles _ and failures _ became easily
dismissed as mere preamble to his inevitable ascension. And the
courageous role played by ordinary black folks and their supporters
was forgotten altogether.
 &HT;    I first started to question the official representation when, as
a 19-year-old minister in training, I heard whispers about King's
rampant womanizing.
 &HT;    Then in the late '80s, I discovered that one of King's sermons,
``Remaining Awake Through a Great Revolution,'' strongly resembled
the sermon of a white minister, Halford Luccock, that had been
published many years earlier.
 &HT;    King's adulterous liaisons eventually came into fuller view with
the publication of ``Bearing the Cross,'' by David Garrow, and
``Parting the Waters,'' by Taylor Branch; Keith Miller later
explored King's plagiarism at great length in his well-publicized
book, ``Voice of Deliverance.''
 &HT;    The awestruck 9-year-old I once was would have been horrified by
these facts, but as I became more conscious of my own moral lapses
and hypocrisies, I found them deeply moving. I felt that for the
first time I was able to grasp what King accomplished in its true
proportions.
 &HT;    When I shared these revelations with others, however _ in
publications and speeches in observance of his holiday _ I
encountered tremendous resistance.
 &HT;    Of course, it's easy to understand why black people are
suspicious of anyone who claims the need to scrutinize King: He was
torn apart in life, so shouldn't he be protected in death? But
protecting him from critical inquiry preserves his image at the
expense of his message.
 &HT;    Consider his current political fortunes. Since his elevation to
the position of national saint, his bowdlerized legacy has been up
for grabs by any and all. On the 1997 anniversary of King's birth,
Ward Connerly, the black conservative, opened his national campaign
against affirmative action by invoking (out of context) King's wish
for his children not to be judged by the ``color of their skin but
by the content of their character.''
 &HT;    This despite the fact that King advocated ``special,
compensatory measures which could be regarded as a settlement'' for
the ``exploitation and humiliation of the Negro in America down
through the centuries.''
 &HT;    Indeed, his image has been appropriated in electoral bids,
hip-hop songs, church sermons and fast-food ads _ of such diverse
and contradictory meanings that he couldn't possibly have approved
of all of them.
 &HT;    Worse yet, investing in King's perfection allows us to dismiss
the humanity of the underregarded, like many beleaguered black
youth, whose violence-drenched culture is said to prove their
distance from King's stature and dream.
 &HT;    King's real danger to American society is buried in all these
romantic portrayals; after all, he wasn't killed for preaching
nonviolence. With a more nuanced view of King in play, we should be
inspired to create social change in our own communities, armed with
the belief that good things can be done by imperfect people. It is
to our national advantage to recuperate the King who tested
America's mettle by challenging us to live right.
 &HT;    And it would benefit us personally to grasp hold of a King whose
blotches and brilliance live on the same block, if for no other
reason than to destroy the self-righteousness that King so rightly
deplored.

STEVE TYRELL OFFERS A NEW TAKE ON OLD STANDARDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL D. CLARK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Steve Tyrell can't help it. Boosting the careers of
other singers is his nature _ even if it's at the expense of his
own vocal career.
</P>
<P>
   After three decades of producing songs for Elvis Presley, B.J.
Thomas, Linda Ronstadt, Rickie Lee Jones and many others, Tyrell
has finally come full-circle on a singing career that began in his
native Houston in the late '60s. His rebirth _ the result of a
happy accident that found him singing ``The Way You Look Tonight''
for the ``Father of the Bride'' soundtrack _ has earned him a
record deal, a just-released album titled ``A New Standard,'' and a
future behind the mike.
</P>
<P>
   So what does Tyrell, a man with a new lease on musical life,
spend the majority of his time talking about?
</P>
<P>
   Others.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas. Ronstadt. Presley. Tyrell touches on them all through
the course of a conversation. He tries to stay focused about his
own CD of big-band gems sung in his soft, slightly roughed-up
tenor, but the hits just keep on coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought B.J. Thomas was the best singer to come out
of Houston, '' says Tyrell, who produced the singer through the
halcyon days of ``Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head'' and ``Hooked
on a Feeling.'' ``Some of the best things I've ever been involved
with have a mind of their own and just take you along for the
ride.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, then Tyrell's career in music has been one
giant Texas Cyclone. It's hard to fault a guy who put his own
singing career aside for a production career that has taken him
from the studios of Presley's last Memphis recording sessions to
writing with Elvis Costello's most recent collaborator, Burt
Bacharach. He's also a soundtrack innovator who has adapted music
for movies from ``An American Tail'' to ``The Brady Bunch Movie,''
and the mind behind the idea of having celebrities sing songs built
for animated movies so they could be radio hits.
</P>
<P>
   Tyrell should be writing a book, not recording a CD. But after
30 years of fine-tuning other people's voices, he finally found his
own.
</P>
<P>
   All this time it had been hiding in songs that Frank Sinatra and
Irving Berlin made famous like ``I've Got the World on a String''
and ``I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm.'' All it took was a demo
made for ``Father of the Bride'' and some cajoling from band leader
Louis Bellson and his wife, Stephanie, to get ``A New Standard''
made.
</P>
<P>
   It also didn't hurt that jazz heavyweights like Joe Sample,
``Toots'' Thielemans and the late Harry ``Sweets'' Edison offered
up the use of their ivories and horns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a such a thrill to meet all these national treasures,''
says Tyrell, who's in his 50s. ``This was the last recording that
`Sweets' ever made, which makes it special.''
</P>
<P>
   The road to ``A New Standard'' started in 1991 when Tyrell was
hired as the music producer for the comedy remake of ``Father of
the Bride'' starring Steve Martin and Diane Keaton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to choreograph music before a movie is shot,'' says
Tyrell. ``We knew we wanted a heartfelt version of `The Way You
Look Tonight' for the scene when Martin first sees his daughter
dancing with her new husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knew, though, who would sing this hanky-grabber. Sting
and many other names were mentioned, but until a decision was made
Tyrell thought he'd record his own version for utility purposes
around the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started playing my rendition for a co-worker outside of the
sound studio on my car radio,'' says Tyrell. ``Soon, Martin and
Keaton and the rest of the cast were outside listening. It was
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyrell ended up not only singing the version played over the end
credits with a 100-piece band (perhaps a first for a guy hired to
produce the music) _ he also appeared in the movie as the wedding
singer and sang two more songs, ``Give Me the Simple Life'' and
``On The Sunny Side of the Street'' for the sequel three years
later. All three songs appear on ``A New Standard.''
</P>
<P>
   To this point Tyrell, a blues man, had never cracked the great
American songbook. The last time he'd sung on a record at all was
as a blues-loving teen-ager playing the Houston rock club circuit.
</P>
<P>
   As a student at St. Thomas High School _ classmates may remember
him as Steve Bilao _ Tyrell's primary interests were the prep
baseball team and blues bands that he would play in at night, like
C.L. and the Pictures and the Art Boatwrights.
</P>
<P>
   Influenced by Chuck Berry and Bobby ``Blue'' Bland, Tyrell had a
few hits around Houston with ``Pay Day Some Day'' and Phil
Spector's ``Young Boy Blues'' in the early '60s. His recordings
were often picked up in Atlanta or Nashville but never made a
splash nationally. After graduating, he jumped to the other side of
the soundboard and found success quickly.
</P>
<P>
   He went to New York City and rose to head of A&AMP;R (artists and
repertoire) and promotions at Scepter Records.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own singing career didn't take off back then,'' says
Tyrell. ``The next best thing I could do was help friends from
Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   He started producing tracks for Dionne Warwick, the Shirelles
and Barbara Lynn, but within six months he brought his Houston
singing peer to Scepter. Country-rock star B.J. Thomas was more of
a pop singer, but he soon scored a hit with a cover of Hank
William's country classic ``I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry.''
</P>
<P>
   He would follow up gold with the Burt Bacharach and Hal
David-penned ``Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head,'' which took the
1969 Oscar for Best Song for ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance
Kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Houstonian, Mark James, was Tyrell's next project. He
never made it as a singer, but a few of his songs are now pop
culture masterpieces. The James-written, Thomas-sung ``Hooked on a
Feeling'' was a Top 10 hit. ``Suspicious Minds'' and ``Always On My
Mind'' were picked up for another singer: Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Memphis started getting hot again, and Elvis decided he was
coming back there to record for the first time since the Sun
Records days,'' says Tyrell. ``I like women, but he was a
breathtaking cat. He looked like a Greek god.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyrell remembers a gentleman in the studio, a guy who liked to
be one of the guys. He remembers a man who called ``Suspicious
Minds'' his favorite song to record, and who threw great New Year's
Eve parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some rules to being around Elvis that were mostly
the rules of the Colonel (Tom Parker),'' says Tyrell. ``He was a
very isolated person, but I never saw him (act) nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   The James song ``Moody Blue'' was the name of Presley's last
album and single before he died. It was published by Tyrell.
</P>
<P>
   There are other moments in Tyrell's producing career he's quick
to talk about:
</P>
<P>
   _ How he made the song ``Somewhere Out There,'' for the animated
movie ``An American Tail,'' an Oscar- and Grammy-winning No. 1
single after he was told by studio suits that nobody wanted to hear
a song sung by mice played on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   _ How young newlyweds everywhere have danced to his ``Father of
the Bride'' songs at their wedding receptions.
</P>
<P>
   _ How he's done production for Blood, Sweat and Tears; the
``Darkwing Duck'' cartoons; and last year's NBC biopic on Sonny and
Cher, ``And the Beat Goes On.''
</P>
<P>
   And on, and on, and on.
</P>
<P>
   But what about your own music, Steve?
</P>
<P>
   ``People told me after `Father of the Bride' that I should do an
album of standards, but it didn't have any resonance with me for a
long time,'' says Tyrell. ``Now I want to spend the rest of my
career doing this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I forgot how nice it is to make your own record and artistic
statement.''

HOLLYWOOD-REBORN-CEMETERIES) 
 
 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hollywood isn't just a place. It's a state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   It's Charlie Chaplin and Gloria Swanson, Mary Pickford and Clara
Bow, Clark Gable and Greta Garbo. It's the Keystone Kops racing up
Hollywood Boulevard and stars stepping in wet cement. It's tennis
at Pickfair, premieres at Grauman's and dancing at Ciro's.
</P>
<P>
   And you can see it all _ put in perspective by time _ in two new
attractions that showcase the glitter that was Hollywood, before
the drugs and the chaos of the 1960s sent Tinseltown sliding
downhill into the 1990s tackiness it's only now recovering from.
</P>
<P>
   The two projects _ a walking tour of historic sites along a
being-rejuvenated Hollywood Boulevard and a new hourlong
documentary about the movies' hometown _ are part of an attempt to
reinvent Hollywood for movie fans the world over, said Leron
Gubler, head of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got word from several countries, like Japan, that they
thought we (Hollywood) were closed down because of all the new
construction,'' Gubler said. ``Nothing could be further from the
truth. We're open for business, and we want to help people enjoy
coming here.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd McCarthy, writer and co-director of ``Forever Hollywood,''
said the film _ which is a history of Hollywood seen through the
eyes of today's stars _ from Daffy Duck and Clint Eastwood to
Gloria Stuart and Kevin Spacey _ has a similar welcoming purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really meant to fit in with what is going on now, which
is the renovation of Hollywood Boulevard, and to give people a
sense of history of the place. Hollywood was always this magnet for
people. It made you feel like anything could happen and your dreams
could come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of today's dream is to return some of the glamour and the
excitement to the movie capital. The under-construction TrizecHahn
development, between Highland Avenue and Orange Drive, wrapped
around the venerable Chinese Theatre, will include not only a
640-room hotel, movie theaters, restaurants and shops, but will
also provide a classy theater that will become the new home of the
Academy Awards ceremonies. To make it easier to visit Hollywood,
there'll be a 3,000-space underground parking garage and the
development's own subway station.
</P>
<P>
   A second subway station has already opened on Argyle Avenue,
just a block east of the famous intersection of Hollywood and Vine.
Tacky souvenir and sex shops are closing their doors, and new
restaurants and shops are moving in.
</P>
<P>
   To Gubler, it's a sign that Hollywood is about to enter a new
era.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's coming back, and it's exciting to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 46 stops along the walking tour, which covers a
25-block loop along Hollywood Boulevard, a stroll that takes about
two hours and 15 minutes to complete. Add another hour to see the
film, a stop for a sandwich and maybe an amble through a
movie-themed bookstore or a visit to the Hollywood Wax Museum, and
you've made a day of it while gaining a new perspective on the
movies and where they were made.
</P>
<P>
   The walking tour and the new film were unveiled with virtually
no fanfare right before the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   It's been difficult for the tour, especially, to sink into
people's consciousness because its landmark pointers _ orange signs
sporting vintage photos and brief histories _ are up in the air on
poles. That's a liability on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, where
visitors walk with their heads down, searching for the names of
their favorite actors on the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have to educate people to look up,'' Gubler said wryly.
``It's a challenge. But it's better than it was at first. The city
wanted the signs 9 feet above the sidewalk. We at least got the OK
to lower them to 8 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the landmarks along the route, sadly, are long gone, but
there are several stops that are much as they were decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Hollywood Roosevelt (where the first Oscars
were handed out in 1929), Musso &AMP; Frank (built in 1919, the town's
oldest continuously operating eatery) and the newly renovated
Egyptian Theatre (where first-run movies are still shown nightly),
sightseers can enjoy seeing the venerable Chinese Theatre (home of
those famous hand- and footprints), the El Capitan Theatre (where
``Citizen Kane'' premiered in 1941, now a Disney movie house) and
the Pantages Theatre (a former movie palace, now a legitimate
theater, said to be haunted by the ghost of onetime owner Howard
Hughes).
</P>
<P>
   Two now-empty historic sites will soon come to life again. The
Pig &AMP; Whistle cafe (the town's first kids-welcome restaurant, where
regulars included Spencer Tracy, Shirley Temple, Loretta Young and
Barbara Stanwyck) next door to the Egyptian Theatre will reopen
within a few months as a Scottish pub. The Max Factor Building
(where Rita Hayworth, Ava Gardner and other movie glamour girls
became even more beautiful) is scheduled to reopen later this year
as the Hollywood History Museum, along with an updated Chasen's
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Movie history buffs will also get a kick out of seeing where
famous places once stood, like the home of C.C. Brown's ice cream
parlor (where the hot fudge sundae was invented), the Montmartre
Cafe (where Rudolph Valentino tangoed and Joan Crawford was
``discovered'' dancing the Charleston) and the Vine Street Brown
Derby (where owner Robert Cobb invented the Cobb Salad and Clark
Gable proposed to Carole Lombard in booth No. 54).
</P>
<P>
   Many of the sites may have fallen victim to the wrecking ball or
the developer, but after you see ``Forever Hollywood'' and stroll
Hollywood Boulevard, you can almost see the limos line up for a
premiere and the stars parading past the klieg lights. Hollywood is
ready for its close-up _ again! &QL;

LIMERICK RISES FROM THE `ASHES'

<P>
   LIMERICK, Ireland _ Finally, there is something that everyone
here agrees on about ``Angela's Ashes'': It rains too much in the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, if it rained as much in Limerick as it did in that film
poor Frankie McCourt would have drowned and never wrote his book,''
said Harry Leahy, 75, a retired doctor, after watching the movie at
the Savoy, a stone's throw from the scenes of ``Angela's Ashes.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank McCourt's bittersweet memoir of growing up poor won the
Pulitzer Prize, has sold more than 6 million copies, and has been
translated into 25 languages. Its story of crushing poverty and
human resilience has touched hearts across the world.
</P>
<P>
   But in Limerick, the squalor and cruelty that McCourt so vividly
described touched a raw nerve. There remains a small but persistent
minority who accuse McCourt of exaggerating his family's suffering
and the humiliation they endured at the hands of Limerick's elite,
especially the Roman Catholic clergy and laity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the vast majority in this city of 100,000 seem to accept
McCourt's harsh account of life in the lanes of Limerick in the
1930s and 1940s. Rather than debate whether the Redemptorist
priests and the teachers at Leamy School were as mean as McCourt
recalls them, most people here seem determined to capitalize on
Limerick's newfound status as a place known by tens of millions of
people throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Limerick's name recognition will only grow with the release of
Alan Parker's film adaptation of ``Angela's Ashes,'' which opened
here Friday and opens across the United States this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect more people will see the film than read the book,''
said John Leonard, tourism development manager for Shannon
Development Co. ``We want to be ready for the people who will come
here after seeing the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Limerick's efforts to exploit the success of ``Angela's Ashes''
are in their nascent stages. The only tangible sign is a walking
tour of sites mentioned in the book, organized by a local community
group. Leonard and other business leaders say Limerick has
benefited from ``Angela's Ashes'' by attracting thousands of
curious tourists who otherwise would not come here.
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 miles from Shannon Airport, Limerick used to be an
industrial port on the Shannon River which tourists passed through
on their way to the lush countryside of Kerry or West Cork. But
those who have read ``Angela's Ashes,'' and even some who are just
vaguely aware of its wide acclaim, have traveled here in the last
few years, seeking out the lanes where McCourt's twin brothers
died, his father walked in a fruitless search for work, and his
mother persevered despite overwhelming grief and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, there is little left of the dark, dank Limerick
that tortured Frank McCourt. None of the squalid tenements where
the McCourts lived still stand. Leamy School is now Leamy House, a
business center. South's pub, where McCourt's father squandered the
food money and where McCourt had his first pint in a rite of
passage fondly recalled in the book and film, is still there. But
these days, the pub is full of suits who work at the Dell Computer
plant, not blackened-faced workers from Suttons coal yard, which
has since closed.
</P>
<P>
   The firm grip that the fire-and-brimstone Redemptorists had on
much of the local population has greatly diminished, a point
underscored by the Utopia Sex Shop on Ellen Street.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said the three churches here that were featured in
McCourt's story refused him permission to film. Brendan Halligan,
editor of the Limerick Leader, disputes that, saying that one
church offered to move a wedding back an hour to accommodate the
filmmakers ``but that wasn't good enough for Mr. Parker and his
crew.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people in Limerick like to point out that Parker was forced
to go to Cork and Dublin to film scenes of squalor that no longer
exist here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I get someone from Cork in my taxi, I remind them of
that,'' cabbie Pat O'Connor said with glee.
</P>
<P>
   At the film's premiere here Wednesday night, Limerick's Mayor
Jack Bourke praised the movie, but suggested it should not have
been shot here at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film should not have been made in Limerick as we do not
have such derelict hovels,'' said Bourke. ``They could only use
certain parts of Limerick and go to Dublin and Cork to shoot the
hovels and lanes as we don't have that in Limerick anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   That Bourke had to raise a fuss to get a premiere staged here at
all fed a well-honed inferiority complex that many McCourt critics
harbor. Originally, the film was going to be premiered in Dublin.
After Bourke complained, the film's distributors belatedly agreed
to simultaneous premieres in Dublin and Limerick.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of Ireland, which is second only to the United
States in world software production, Limerick has boomed over the
last 10 years, progress quite unrelated to ``Angela's Ashes.''
Still, Limerick suffers from an image problem that is also
unrelated to the place so richly captured by McCourt. In the 1980s,
an Irish comic dubbed it ``Stab City,'' a catchy putdown that
remains especially popular with Dubliners, even though the Irish
capital has more crime per capita than Limerick.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Gleeson, research executive for the Limerick Chamber of
Commerce, spent three years studying the city's image and concluded
that most Irish people have a negative perception of Limerick. She
said interviews with tourists revealed that their negative view of
the city was almost always introduced or reinforced by
conversations with Irish people.
</P>
<P>
   McCourt's critics blame him for perpetuating that negative
image, but Gleeson said her research did not reveal that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think `Angela's Ashes' can do nothing but good for
Limerick,'' said Gleeson, 28. ``It put us on the map. And my
research showed that a lot of what Frank McCourt said was true.
Limerick was more fervently religious than other cities back then.
The poverty was bad. Even my dad went to school without shoes. Some
people are embarrassed by that, but that's the way it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Gleeson is among those who believe the city has been slow to
capitalize on the interest in `` Angela's Ashes.'' A $3.5 million
public-private project to boost the city's image called Limerick
2005 aims at changing that.
</P>
<P>
   There is talk of creating an Angela's Ashes Trail, but so far
the only tourist attraction is a walking tour organized by the St.
Mary's Development Program, a community group that uses the $6 fee
to help the poor and elderly of the city's oldest parish. John
O'Regan, 38, the group's liaison officer, said that about 800
people from all over the world have taken the tour since it was
created in 1997, but he hopes the numbers will rise dramatically
this year because of the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tour takes people to the places that Frank McCourt
described in the book, but it also shows them the Limerick of
today,'' said O'Regan.
</P>
<P>
   The tour's altruistic roots did little to appease the likes of
Paddy Malone, who called the tour organizers and accused them of
being ``a front for Frank McCourt.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone, a classmate of McCourt's, disputes McCourt's
recollections and complains that he wrote about people without
their permission. In 1997, Malone stood before McCourt during a
book-signing at O'Mahoney's bookshop here and tore up a copy of
``Angela's Ashes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Malone and the other begrudgers were nowhere to be seen a
few months ago when McCourt returned to sign copies of the sequel,
`` 'Tis.'' David O'Mahoney said he and his brother, Frank, put on
extra security at their bookshop, but a feared protest never
materialized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a tendency to pay too much attention to the
begrudgers,'' said David O'Mahoney. ``The vast majority of people
in Limerick loved the book and will love the film.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Mahoney's, Limerick's biggest bookshop, has sold more than
6,000 copies of ``Angela's Ashes,'' about 10 times more than any
previous bestseller, and 1,200 copies of `` 'Tis.'' In contrast,
two books written by Gerry Hannan, a radio show host who is
McCourt's fiercest and some say most opportunist critic, have found
a distinctly minority audience. O'Mahoney said Hannan's ``Ashes,''
which views Limerick through more rose-colored glasses, has sold
500 copies, while Hannan's own sequel, `` 'Tis in Me Ass,'' has
sold just over 100.
</P>
<P>
   Like Frank McCourt, most of Limerick has moved on, even
physically. For centuries, the city's buildings turned their backs
on the Shannon, the river whose damp brought misery to impoverished
families like the McCourts. Now, the city has been largely rebuilt
to face the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turning around to face the Shannon has opened new vistas for
Limerick,'' said Gleeson.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the film, meanwhile, has created a new dilemma
for the begrudgers, who can't decide what bothers them more, that
``Angela's Ashes'' was written by an American, or filmed by an
Englishman.

<P>
   No visit to historic Hollywood would be complete without seeking
out the final resting places of stars who shone so brightly long
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect place to start is Hollywood Forever, the town's
original cemetery, on the south side of Santa Monica Boulevard
between Gower Street and Van Ness Avenue, backed up to Paramount
Studios.
</P>
<P>
   Until about a year ago, the cemetery _ opened in 1897 _ was
called Hollywood Memorial Park. New owners have renamed it and are
working on $7 million in renovations. Many cemeteries that hold
stars' remains won't point out specific graves, but here a friendly
staff will steer sightseers to stars' final venues.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find Tyrone Power's white marble bench, the impressive
tomb of Cecil B. DeMille, Douglas Fairbanks Sr.'s outdoor
sarcophagus and reflecting pool, and the crypt of the original
Latin lover, Rudolph Valentino. Also buried at Hollywood Forever
are voice artist Mel Blanc, Columbia Pictures chief Harry Cohn,
gangster Benjamin ``Bugsy'' Siegel, producer Jesse Lasky, directors
John Huston, Victor Fleming and William Desmond Taylor, and actors
Adolphe Menjou, Janet Gaynor (winner of the first best-actress
Oscar), Virginia Rappe (who died in a wild San Francisco orgy with
comic Roscoe ``Fatty'' Arbuckle), Eleanor Powell, Peter Finch,
Peter Lorre and Norma Talmadge.

 US ASSESSES COSTS OF MIDEAST PEACE
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Middle East juggling act is taking place this
week, and President Clinton is cast as the juggler.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has micromanaged Middle East peace talks to a far
greater degree than any president, faces a set of dual negotiations
involving Israel and Syria, and Israel and the Palestinians. And he
must grapple with shaping a multibillion-dollar package of military
sweeteners for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a quarter-century, starting just after the 1973
Yom Kippur War, US presidents and secretaries of state have argued
that Middle East peace efforts should move ahead on all tracks at
once. That wish is finally coming true _ but some US officials,
concerned about cost, say it may be a case of being careful what
you wish for.
</P>
<P>
   Two US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
administration is considering a $15 billion to $17 billion package
for Israel. One especially difficult question is whether to include
the F-22 Raptor stealth aircraft, a $166 million plane that is
still being tested and that is forbidden by law to be sold to
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   The second round of the Israel-Syria talks begins on Wednesday
in Shepherdstown, W.Va. On Thursday, the Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat arrives at the White House for a private meeting with
Clinton, who afterward will orchestrate a meeting between Arafat
and the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and probably himself.
</P>
<P>
   For Barak, who pledged after his July election that he could
advance peace talks on all fronts, this is a test of his ambition.
For Clinton, desperate for a lasting legacy that doesn't include an
intern, this is his last stab at being a Middle East peacemaker in
the mold of former President Carter. He has 11 months left to try.
</P>
<P>
   His subordinates feel some pressure. ``Pressure can be
helpful,'' said one US official involved in the talks. ``By
definition, there is pressure if the president is running out to
West Virginia and looking over your shoulder all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Clinton spent more than 70 hours over nine days at the
Wye River Plantation, Md., talks between the Israelis and
Palestinians, to gain a deal that only nudged the process along.
This month, he spent 25 hours over five days at Shepherdstown, W.
Va., often in a role of counselor trying to open dialogue between
enemies. For Wednesday, when Israel-Syria talks resume, the
president has blocked off seven hours for Shepherdstown.
</P>
<P>
   Some say he's right to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you rather him living in the New York suburbs with
Hillary?'' said Richard W. Murphy, the director of Middle East
Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former longtime
US diplomat. ``We have spoiled the Arabs and the Israelis with the
level of American government interaction ever since 1973. Clinton
is different in the sense that he's more involved at a much earlier
point. Time will tell whether he looks extremely wise or he looks
like a fool. If it works, the payoff is huge.''
</P>
<P>
   At several US agencies, the work leading to this week has been
intense. One diplomat flew to the Gaza Strip to talk with Arafat.
Clinton called the Syrian president, Hafez al-Assad, from his new
home in Chappaqua, N.Y. After much debate, the US team decided to
hold the next round at Shepherdstown despite complaints from
``senior officials who had to share rooms'' at the Clarion Hotel
and Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials even schemed about ways to stop delegation
members from speaking to the media. One adviser wanted to know if
it was legal to jam cellular phone transmissions over the
conference center airspace. (It is not.)
</P>
<P>
   For Israel and Syria, the deal is about returning the Golan
Heights to Syria in exchange for normalized relations and security
guarantees. For Israel and the Palestinians, the talks are about
tackling the thorniest issues remaining in the half-century of the
Arab-Israeli conflict: the future of Jerusalem, the creation of a
Palestinian state, the return of Palestinian refugees, and the
sharing of scarce water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The Israel-Syria deal might be wrapped up in a few months,
according to Barak and outside observers. That, in turn, would
presumably lead to an Israel-Lebanon deal, which would call for the
withdrawal of Israeli troops from south Lebanon and effectively rob
Hezbollah guerrillas of a cause.
</P>
<P>
   If all this falls into place, Israel would be ringed by
countries with whom they have made peace.
</P>
<P>
   That stunning reality would likely thaw diplomatic, cultural,
and economic relations with the far reaches of the Arab world,
ending the Arab-Israel conflict as it been defined since the
creation of Israel in 1948. The conflict would revert to its roots,
moving away from a state-to-state battle and toward a communal one,
between distrustful Israeli and Palestinian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians had hoped to arrive in Washington at a lull in
the Israel-Syria talks because its leaders fear being overshadowed,
capturing less of Clinton's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, in fact, canceled a meeting with Clinton scheduled for
this Friday because he thought the Israelis and Syrians would still
be in the area. After the new meeting was set for Thursday, the
Israelis and Syrians ruined his plans by restarting talks this
week.
</P>
<P>
   But US officials don't share his concerns. Neither do several
former US ambassadors and several Arab world diplomats in
Washington, who think that the two tracts are intersecting
precisely because many factors are in line for dealmaking, even for
key parts of an Israeli-Palestinian agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Said Nabil Fahmy, Egypt's ambassador to the United States:
``This is not stage-managed, nobody tried to put this together for
this week in Washington. This is a good coincidence. There is
promise in the Syrian track, promise in the Palestinian track. They
are both moving together at the same time. This is a first. And
this is not a mere coincidence. It is caused by the changing
reality in the Middle East, a reflection of how the Middle East has
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time,'' said Abdulwahab Al-Hajjri, Yemen's
ambassador to the United States. ``What we should do right now is
try to encourage everybody to go ahead and show our support. We
think it's moving and it's going to continue to move.''
</P>
<P>
   But few say an Israeli-Syrian peace deal, for instance, would
rapidly change the political, military, or economic realities.
Israel, by all measures, enjoys a qualitative advantage,
economically and militarily.
</P>
<P>
   And Israel's strategic military advantage in the region, backed
by its nuclear capability, should grow after an Israeli-Syrian
deal. While the United States has talked with Syria about upgrading
its military, the Syrian demands pale next to the Israeli ones.
Israel presented a list of items that Pentagon specialists put at
$17 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It includes unrestricted access to US satellite imagery,
Tomahawk missiles, Apache helicopters, Blackhawk helicopters,
Hercules planes, and completion of missile defense systems.
</P>
<P>
   And US officials are reported to be considering whether to push
for delivering the F-22 fighter to Israel as well. The national
security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, asked senior Pentagon officials
recently to clarify the sales prohibition, attached by Congress for
the last three years, according to the two US officials who spoke
on condition of anonymity, and who stressed that the discussions
were at a preliminary stage.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter last July, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff called the
F-22 the ``aircraft we are counting on to guarantee control of the
skies in the next century.'' Because of the strategic importance of
the planes, and because of Israel's record of technology transfers
to other countries, many conservative congressmen are likely to
object to any sale of F-22s.
</P>
<P>
   Some senior Pentagon officials also have voiced concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of back-door stuff going on now with the White
House on Israel's proposal,'' a Pentagon official said. ``Some
people here are scared to death that we're going to be giving away
all kinds of big missile defense systems and F-22s.''
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, a National Security Council spokesman, declined to
comment on Israel's requests, but added: ``We take Israel's
security needs as one of our core foreign policy principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, the Pentagon announced that Lockheed Martin Corp.
has been awarded a $1.34 billion contract to build 50 F-16D fighter
jets for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, has said
repeatedly that any reports on assistance are premature, but the US
official involved in the talks said the financial discussions would
be arising soon. The official said: ``Don't you think Israel has to
have a concrete idea of what it's going to get before it signs
anything?''

<P>
   The Sunday piano recital, an invitation-only affair, was about
to start. The guests, who included Nobel Prize-winning Harvard
chemist William Lipscomb and prominent jazz composer George
Russell, took their places and studied the program, all original
compositions.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm, interesting. There was one piece called ``The Evil Genie''
and another intriguingly named ``Pancakes on Mars.'' There was
``World Peace, Food and Presents,'' a nod, evidently, to the
holiday season, and the postmodern-sounding ``Floured Child.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid silence, the first performer, Jenna Lipscomb, daughter of
William, took her place confidently at the Steinway grand piano,
and with great composure rendered a rhythmic version of ``Wild
Horse Dancing.'' The audience burst into applause.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it's not every 11-year-old who writes her own music,
albeit with major assistance from her teacher, Ben Schwendener.
</P>
<P>
   But then Schwendener, 37, is no ordinary piano teacher. A jazz
composer and member of the jazz-rock group Falling Objects, he
offers students what he calls a ``customized education'' in piano.
You won't find any standardized beginning-level piano method books
in Schwendener's third-floor Boston studio, with their pictures of
cute frogs hopping over notes, or clowns juggling clef signs. You
won't see any smiley-face stickers proclaiming ``Wow!'' or ``Good
job!'' on students' music after they've tackled a new piece.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Schwendener's piano students (four adults, 14 children,
ages 7-15) all receive a blank composition book. The rest is up to
them _ and their teacher. During the first lesson, he talks to them
about their musical interests and abilities, figures out their
strengths (strong rhythmic sense? melodic inclination?), and he
helps them write their own pieces, based on themes they plunk out
on the piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I'm the artistic director'' as well as piano
teacher, Schwendener says. ``I have yet to buy stickers for my
students; they can stick anything they want to on their music,
because everything they do is a work in progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, his students learn how to read music and the rudiments of
theory, and are gradually introduced to the musical masters. But
they don't start their musical training the traditional way,
through scales or finger exercises. ``I don't go down that road,''
says Schwendener.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, aiming to broaden their musical experience, he goes the
improvisational route, indicating even to the youngest students
that their musical instincts are worthwhile and relevant, and that
they don't have to be a Bach or Bartok to compose a meaningful
musical theme. He might throw a scale into the lesson now and then,
but it's a scale on which to improvise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to demystify the compositional process and encourage
improvisation and ear training,'' said the upbeat, boyish-looking
Schwendener in an interview after the recital, which featured 11
enthusiastic students playing an assortment of tunes from blues to
a tango, a Celtic dance, a new arrangement of a Burt Bacharach
tune, and variations on a song by John Lennon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately,'' he says, ``it's the organic process of creating
new music that appeals to me. I love the way all students are all
different, and every student has different ideas about how the
themes develop.''
</P>
<P>
   He maintains that every child has an innate creative ability
that can be expressed musically (though piano may not be the
perfect outlet for them at the time, he allows), and that profound
ideas can be conveyed in the simplest terms, even by a little
person. Witness the creation of ``Flower Fox,'' a happy little folk
ditty he wrote last year with his daughter, Elodi, then 3. It is
based on three notes _ E, F, and C _ that Elodi picked out on the
piano. She might not have been aware of it, but her dad harmonized
her notes, using the inner modal harmonies of the F Lydian scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's `Flower Fox'!'' she said to him excitedly,
spontaneously naming it.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the piano recital everyone seemed excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben has a way of bringing out the best in people,'' says
Jenna's father, himself a classical clarinetist. ``He tries to find
out what students are interested in and reaches them that way,
through the composition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We made up pieces together; they're really cool,'' Jenna
beamed.
</P>
<P>
   Hovik Papazian, 14, of Belmont, was all smiles after his
performance of three pieces, which included a variation of the song
``Money'' by John Lennon, and an impressionistic homage to Erik
Satie called ``Eiffel Down.'' Schwendener has been working with
Papazian since he was 5. Now, says Schwendener, Papazian is ``a
self-motivated, creative pianist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I hear something on the radio and tell (Ben) about
it, and he changes it around,'' says Papazian, describing how they
work together. ``But he prefers creating things, like jazz. We've
tried something traditional, like Bach, and I was able to play it,
but it's different. You can't mix it around, and if you make a
mistake you can't cover it up, really. I might have missed out on
some stuff, like technical things, but I've also gained. With Ben,
you can be free with the music.''
</P>
<P>
   Piano students, however, represent only a fraction of
Schwendener's work. He records albums with Falling Objects and
teaches composition and piano at the Longy School of Music and New
England Conservatory of Music (from which he graduated in 1986 with
a degree in jazz composition). He teaches a graduate course in
creative and critical thinking at UMass-Boston.
</P>
<P>
   He also started a pilot program, though his nonprofit
organization called Gravity Arts, to provide customized education
to an unlikely population: corporate employees. The idea is to
assist employees who play or have played an instrument _ at any
musical level _ in forming an ensemble, by custom-composing music
for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are corporate softball teams, why not a corporate
ensemble?'' Schwendener reasons. ``How many people are there in
corporations who have played a musical instrument and love it but
don't have some sort of venue in which to express it?'' he says.
``This teaches diversity. It teaches creative problem-solving. It
provides employees with a response to their creative needs.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a surprise to learn that such an innovative musical thinker
was trained in a fairly conventional way _ method books, stickers
and all. ``None of my early piano teachers was comfortable with
improvisation,'' says Schwendener, who grew up in Okemos, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   He joined a jazz band in high school and was increasingly drawn
to jazz, rock music, and improvising. He moved to Boston in 1982 to
study at the New England Conservatory with the imminent jazz
musician and musical theorist Russell, and was heavily influenced
by the composer's Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization,
the first modal theory of music coming out of the innovative jazz
tradition. Based on the Lydian scale and a ladder of intervals of
fifths, it made possible a new approach to improvising.
</P>
<P>
   Russell himself made an appearance at the recent children's
recital, dazzling the audience with his story of how he came to
write ``Cubano-Be, Cubano-Bop'' for Dizzy Gillespie in New York, a
piece that was performed at Carnegie Hall. ``What I heard here
today was amazing. Thank you,'' he told the children. ``You're all
fine young people, and bright lights like you will pass your
knowledge along to everybody. That's the way it seems to go.''

MCCAIN APPEALING TO A YOUNGER CROWD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILFORD, N.H. _ It was Wednesday, 7:45 a.m., at the Veterans of
Foreign Wars post.
</P>
<P>
   The room had everything one would expect. Paneled walls. Folding
chairs. Old portraits of soldiers. An audience of housewives,
retirees, and an American flag as a stage prop for Senator John
McCain, who had come for another town meeting before the Feb. 1
primary.
</P>
<P>
   But there, as jarring as the glittery disco ball hanging from
above, was 19-year-old Neil Miller, asking about the Arizona
Republican's campaign finance reform plan and its impact on the
political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dear young friend,'' McCain said, ``you are no longer
represented in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidate's response captured two trends emerging in this
presidential campaign: Young people still aren't voting, studies
show, because they feel disconnected. But growing numbers seem to
be connecting with McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Despite disagreeing with his conservative views on abortion, his
promise to beef up the military, and his belief that filtering
software should be put on computers to protect children from
Internet pornography, they like him precisely because he recognizes
their cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   When Elizabeth Dole dropped out of the Republican primary, her
entire youth organization, with a couple of thousand volunteers,
immediately switched to McCain and not the party front-runner,
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Students from Harvard University, which some conservatives
consider the belly of the liberal beast, have signed onto his
campaign. And then there are those like Miller, who crawled out of
bed on a biting cold morning during his college break to talk about
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Despite McCain's mock penchant for the rock group Nine Inch
Nails (which he later admitted was an inappropriate joke during a
televised debate), these teenagers and twentysomethings give
similar responses when asked why they are paying attention to him
and probably supporting him.
</P>
<P>
   They think he's genuine. They think he's a hero, at a time when
there are few, for surviving five years as a Vietnam prisoner of
war. And they think he is inspiring when he makes Kennedy-like
statements urging young Americans to do something ``beyond your own
self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has more virtues than vices,'' Miller, of El Camino,
Calif., said after listening to McCain tackle questions for more
than an hour. ``Most politicians are more practical than emotional.
Al Gore just seems like a robot; I'm doubting his speeches.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 18-year-olds were allowed to vote in 1972, their turnout
rate has steadily declined. Turnout in 1998 elections among this
group was estimated at less than 20 percent, a record low.
</P>
<P>
   To understand why this generation of young voters does not
participate at the polling place is to understand why McCain is
catching on.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate school study at the University of California at Los
Angeles last year found that only 25 percent of incoming students
believe keeping up with politics is important. The study also
showed that volunteerism was becoming popular with freshmen because
they see that results and change are more likely that way.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, a survey released in September by the Pew Charitable
Trust's Project Vote Smart found that a quarter of 18- to
25-year-olds were uninterested in casting ballots because they
don't trust government.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's platform of ``getting big money out of politics'' and
``restoring integrity to the White House'' seems to be written with
them in mind.
</P>
<P>
   While it may not be surprising that Bill Bradley's campaign for
the Democratic nomination has the support of many campus ideologues
because of his intellectual approach to helping the
disenfranchised, the support for McCain among young adults was less
expected.
</P>
<P>
   During a three-day conference that ended Saturday, more than
1,000 high school and college students descended on Manchester for
a campaign convention to hear the candidates, learn about issues
and sign up for political organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Markham, executive director of Participation 2000, which
recruits students to help elect Democrats, sat at a booth at the
conference and said she believes McCain and Bradley are the only
candidates addressing young people's feeling of not being
represented in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was surprised at the number of McCain supporters I've
seen here,'' Markham added.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Arfaa Webster, a marketing director for George Washington
University, which also had a booth for its graduate program, said
she noticed in the crowd ``more Bradley fans than Gore, and more
McCain fans than Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   She said one reason might be that Bradley and McCain present
compelling personal stories.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a former Rhodes Scholar and star forward for the New
York Knicks basketball team, tells about come-from-behind, on-court
victories that resonate with aspiring athletes and fans, who quite
literally look up to him.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, whose campaign posters of him as a young Navy pilot have
become pinups for teenage girls, has war stories to tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thankful for what he did,'' said 17-year-old Blake Norton,
who is considering joining the military. Although Norton will not
be old enough to vote in the primary, he attended a McCain town
hall meeting in Merrimack High School and brought two friends. ``I
know a lot of kids who are really interested in this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also uses humor as a way of reaching out to audiences,
making young people feel less intimidated. He has four children
ages 15 and younger, and his Phoenix home is wired with five
personal computers, enabling him to relate with young audiences.
</P>
<P>
   That's evident when he cites Star Wars _ the movie, not the
would-be missile defense system _ likening himself to Luke
Skywalker as a metaphor for his underdog campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And it was evident the other day when an MTV reporter, traveling
on McCain's campaign bus, asked: ``Are you living `La Vida Loca,'
Senator?''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's 28-year-old aide blushed, but the 63-year-old candidate
laughed heartily at the reference to the Ricky Martin song about
``the crazy life'' and said, yes, he was, in fact, living ``La Vida
Loca'' on the Straight Talk Express.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also has one of the most complete Web sites among the
candidates. The Pew survey found that most young respondents said
the Internet was their most useful information source.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, McCain said something crystalized for him
during a trip in May to the John F. Kennedy Library to receive a
Profile in Courage Award for his efforts on campaign finance
reform.
</P>
<P>
   He watched recordings of Kennedy's speeches and was moved anew.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest mission of a president is to motivate a
generation of Americans whose cause is greater than their own
self-interest,'' McCain said, sipping a Coke during a recent ride
to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Zack Turner, a 22-year-old college student from New York City,
said McCain has motivated him.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the back during the town hall meeting at Merrimack
last week, Turner was holding a small flag on a stick and taking a
breather. This was not a typical college vacation for him. He was
working for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I can trust him,'' said Turner, who is registered
as an independent but said he leans to the left. ``It's the the
first time I've wanted to volunteer for a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner said he disagrees with McCain's antiabortion stance and
thinks his tax cut plan is a little too generous. But he likes the
fact that McCain keeps talking about Social Security being bankrupt
by the time the current crop of college students retires. He likes
McCain's plan to use the federal budget surplus to shore up the
fund, as well as a separate proposal to pay down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, that's important,'' Turner added, ``particularly
for our generation.''

 FOOLISH TO PASS UP MATCHING 401(k) PLAN  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 26, a recently admitted attorney, and am currently
earning $36,000 a year at a Boston law firm. My legal education has
left me with $95,000 in student loan debt. One loan, for $55,000,
is very flexible and repayments can be indexed to my income. The
other $40,000 requires payments of $500 per month for 15 years.
Both have interest rates of 7.5 percent, and can be repaid without
penalty. In addition to this, I have about $3,000 in credit card
debt at 9 percent. After rent, the state loan payments, and
assorted other payments, I'm not left with much, so I am deferring
payment on the larger loan, with interest subsidized while I am
still eligible for this. What sort of general long-term investment
strategies would you recommend for me? Now that I am finally out of
school I am anxious to get on with my life and make some real
estate investments while I am still young and can enjoy them, but I
realize my debt is going to be an albatross for some time. Should I
be doing anything now to invest for retirement, such as making a
monthly 401(k) contribution, or should I be more concerned with
using what disposable income I have to pay off my credit card and
student loan debt? My employer would match 50 percent of any
contributions to the 401(k) that I might make, up to 3 percent of
my salary. Does it make any sense at all to put money into
investments that probably would not earn much more than the
interest rate I am paying on my student loans?
</P>
<P>
   D.H., Newton, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Of course it does. I know your financial situation is tough,
but can you afford to turn your back on a free $520 a year?
</P>
<P>
   If you invested that 3 percent into the 401(k), or $86.66 a
month, and your employer added a further $43.33 each month, after a
year you would have $1,560, and the advance in the portfolio would
be equivalent to an investment paying more than 108 percent. Even
the credit card debt seems insignificant in comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in the second year, your $1,560 balance would have to
pull its own weight, but if you continued at that $86.66 rate and
got the same 50 percent match, by the end of the second year you
would have a total of $3,119; again, presuming no portfolio growth,
the employer match would provide the equivalent of a 25.5 percent
interest rate on the entire 401(k) balance.
</P>
<P>
   Since you say there's not much left after your current expenses,
and I've already (at least on paper) tapped 3 percent of your
pretax income, the question of the next step may be moot.
</P>
<P>
   But if there's still a little money left over, I would focus
first on getting rid of the credit card debt, then on the student
loans. For the moment, I'd forget about real estate or other
investments that would go beyond the level that wins you the
maximum 401(k) matches. If you're good at your profession, your
financial rewards should advance at a steep pace, and what now
seems a mountain of debt will soon enough seem manageable, then
insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, take a look at your loan schedules and payments. My
calculator says that a 7.5 percent loan of $40,000 would require a
monthly payment of only $365 to be paid off over 15 years; if you
reversed the balances, a $500 monthly payment would be close to the
right figure to pay off a $55,000 balance over 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have the responsibility for, but lack the authority to
change, a relative's $616,000 portfolio, consisting of seven
stocks. Two of them _ an oil company and a utility _ are just
keeping their heads above water. But the remaining five _ another
oil, three more utilities, and an industrial stock _ are worth even
less today than at the end of 1995. When I push the broker for
improvement, all I hear is a lament about the potential long-term
capital gains for the owner, who is an unusually alert 100-year-old
woman. What do you recommend?
</P>
<P>
   B.B., Sylvania, Ohio &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I cannot fathom how you might have responsibility for this
portfolio, but no authority to do anything about it. If you have no
authority to make any change, you really don't have the
responsibility for it.
</P>
<P>
   But in any event, I would discuss the situation with the person
who is responsible for handing your relative's taxes, just to make
sure the broker is correct.
</P>
<P>
   I would start by asking whether a relatively small portion of
the underperforming stock positions might be sold each year without
terribly punitive tax consequences.
</P>
<P>
   If the answer is no, as indeed it might be, I see little you can
do. If the answer is yes, I'd ask the tax expert to write to the
broker, spelling out how much of the stocks might be sold in any
given period, what the tax consequences would be, and his or her
recommendation of a course of action.
</P>
<P>
   But you should also bear in mind that underperforming utilities
tend to have handsome yields, and if you are simply looking at the
value of the principal and ignoring the dividends that have been
paid to your relative, you are missing a big part of the overall
picture. That is particularly true if they are preferred stocks.
</P>
<P>
   If you still think this portfolio is all that terrible after
considering the tax and yield situations, the next time you talk to
the broker, you might mention that at the end of January, 1995, the
Dow Jones utilities average stood at 193.12, compared with 297.78
entering this week, offering a strong argument that some of these
issues probably could have been sold long ago and the capital gains
taxes paid, with your elderly relative still gaining on an
after-tax basis.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest that you do not go to your elderly relative, whatever
the situation. Most centenarians aren't all that concerned about
money (provided, of course, that they have enough of it) and even
if your relative is unusually alert for her age, all you are likely
to do is stir up a lot of unnecessary anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I will be closing on the sale of my house at the end of the
month, and as a result I am going to receive $70,000, which will be
used as the down payment on a new house that won't be completed
until June or July. In the meantime, I would like to receive the
best return possible on this cash. What do you recommend?
</P>
<P>
   C.F., Attleboro, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I suggest you take the dull, safe route of putting the cash
into a CD or a money market fund.
</P>
<P>
   What might you gain if you decided to take a moderate risk,
putting the funds in a short-term bond fund that delivered 6
percent, rather than a rate of around 5 percent from cash-type
investments? Something like $300 to $350.
</P>
<P>
   What might you lose if the bond market headed south because of
higher interest rates, or the fear of them? Probably not awfully
much _ but still, there's the possibility of losing $1,000 or so,
even if you chose a conservative fund.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way: By agreeing to buy the new house, you have
established a very short-term liability. Following the traditional
principle of investing, these funds should accordingly be invested
in a very short-term asset. The time period is simply too short to
win a significant advantage by taking chances.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 29, married, and live in an apartment. We have $4,000
invested in Legg Mason Value Trust and add $150 a month. We have
stocks valued at $7,000 and $10,000 in bank savings. I contribute 6
percent of my earnings to a company-matched 401(k) plan. We want to
buy a house in the next six to eight months, but want to invest as
aggressively as possible. Our combined earnings are $72,000 a year.
What would be the best approach to take toward investing while
saving for the house?
</P>
<P>
   S.S., Gloucester, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The critical thing is to decide what the purpose of each of
your current portfolio assets is, and then to tailor the investment
to that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   With the projected home purchase less than a year away,
short-term CDs, money markets, or even bank savings are appropriate
for that money, and, as I discussed in the letter above, nothing
very much more aggressive is appropriate. Then isolate which
accounts you consider as your retirement savings, and put these in
growth-oriented stock accounts or stock funds.
</P>
<P>
   Isolate a fairly small portion of your portfolio as emergency
savings, and keep that in a liquid vehicle similar to what you will
be using to save toward your real estate down payment.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, if either the Legg Mason account or the individual
stock holdings are ultimately going to be used for the down
payment, the time to sell them is now.

DIGGING HER CLAWS INTO FELINE RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This morning I saw that during the night one or perhaps both of
the cats had managed to separate a big piece of fringe from the
edge of an oriental rug. Nearby lay the damp, mutilated fringe,
Sunday part of a handsome carpet, today just another cat toy.
</P>
<P>
   I took a deep breath and told myself once again that cats will
be cats. A gnawed rug is a small price to pay for their
companionship. Which brings me to why I could never vote for
Hillary Clinton. During that unctuous performance on David
Letterman's ``Late Show'' the other night, she admitted that first
feline Socks has been declawed.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it's not the only reason I could never vote for her, just
the latest. But it's as good as any, and symbolic in a way of her
whole ethos.
</P>
<P>
   How would she like it if somebody cut off the ends of her
fingers? Because that's what declawing amounts to. Here's a partial
description of the operation, from ``The Cornell Book of Cats,'' by
the faculty and staff of Cornell University's Feline Health Center:
``The nail is not pulled; instead, the end bone of the digit
holding the claw is amputated at the joint . . . the feet are
bandaged, and several days of hospitalization are required.''
</P>
<P>
   Declawing is at best controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very sad and frustrating that this is a tolerated
procedure and that people don't know it's cruel,'' says Barbara
Stagno, Northeast director of In Defense of Animals. ``People think
that if veterinarians are willing to do it, it couldn't be
inhumane. But if people knew what was involved in declawing, most
of them wouldn't opt for it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Letterman's show, Clinton explained that Socks had been
declawed to prevent him damaging White House furniture, ``like
George Washington's chair.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added, ``I didn't want to have to explain what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Socks ever succeeded in scratching any
national treasures. Could the declawing have been a preemptive
strike, based on the species-ist assumption that all cats are
destructive?
</P>
<P>
   And what of Buddy, the presidential dog? Has he never scratched
a White House door? I bet he still has all his toenails. When he
misbehaves he turns on the charm and all is forgiven. Just like a
dog. Just like his owner, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways other than surgery to discourage cats from
tearing apart your house. Scratching posts. Behavior modification.
Little plastic caps that can be affixed to the cat's nails,
assuming the cat will stand for it. Mine won't. Actually, nothing
I've ever tried has succeeded in stopping the little devils from
shredding the furniture. But I know some of these methods have
worked for others.
</P>
<P>
   Cats use their claws for grooming, climbing, and protection, as
well as scratching. Declawing is not in the best interest of the
cat, but of the owner. It's often a last resort for people who've
tried other methods of curbing a cat's destructive behavior. The
best that can be said of declawing is that it's preferable to
getting rid of the cat. ``We love our cats,'' says Stagno, ``but
some of us love our furniture more.''
</P>
<P>
   True cat love transcends even shredded upholstery. Our furniture
is their furniture, too. Actually, as cats see it, it's their
furniture, period. Cartoonist Nicole Hollander once summed up a
cat's view of the world with the line, ``Everything here is mine.''
It's all too true in my house.
</P>
<P>
   Scratching is normal cat behavior, a form of self-expression.
``Animal behaviorists believe cats scratch objects primarily as a
function of communication,'' writes Amy D. Shojai in ``The Purina
Encyclopedia of Cat Care.'' ``Scratching leaves scent behind on the
object, as well as visible marks, and both communicate that the cat
has been there. It also conditions claws and tones muscles.''
</P>
<P>
   As you might imagine, my cats' claws are in beautiful condition.
I wish I could say the same for the furniture.

`AN AMERICAN BORN IN AN ENGLISHMAN'S BODY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Hoose and the Cantata Singers thought that the best way to
celebrate the new century was to commission a new piece, and the
composer they chose was Andy Vores.
</P>
<P>
   The result, Vores' ``World Wheel,'' is a piece that opens with
the ``Big Bang'' and then circles around 4,000 years of history.
The texts come from 2000 BC, 1000 BC, from the first century AD,
from 1000 AD and from living 20th-century American poets. The range
of musical styles and references is necessarily less diverse but
nevertheless pretty encompassing _ in the 20th-century alone they
range from Schoenberg and Stravinsky to Reich and Glass, with a bit
of James Brown too.
</P>
<P>
   Vores is unabashed by the word ``eclectic.'' ``I have very
catholic tastes,'' he says with a grin, ``and I don't think the
choices and disciplines of composing need to consist of an attempt
to filter out influences. They're going to be there, but I think it
all comes out sounding like me.'' He knew he was writing for the
Cantata Singers and David Hoose, so he knew there was no reason to
hold back. ``I do not think that David likes to feature singers and
small ensembles from the chorus as soloists, so I put some of that
into the piece, and I know Sandy Sylvan's voice, so his sound was
in my ear as I wrote. But mostly, writing for the Cantata Singers
meant I could do anything I wanted to because there's nothing they
can't do _ in this piece they clap, moan, and shout, and they sing
a lot too.''
</P>
<P>
   Vores's orchestration omits clarinets because he knew that he
would share the program with a Bach Cantata, but he did include an
electric guitar and synthesizer that Bach wouldn't have called for.
The score roams through and re-creates the characteristic sounds of
several different musical cultures. ``The piece has got a big
reach, from the beginning of time to the end of time _ all in 45
minutes of big, exciting noise. The piece really revels in various
kinds of sound,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``World Wheel'' is a big piece in a big year for the 43-year-old
composer, who is also writing pieces for Boston Musica Viva
(``Umberhulk'') and Triple Helix, the extraordinary piano trio.
Triple Helix will play the premiere of ``Dark Mother'' on its
Celebrity Series's Emerging Artists concert April 16 in Jordan
Hall. Vores has written pieces for so many Emerging Artist and
Celebrity Series concerts _ the Borromeo Quartet, soprano Dominique
Labelle, and soprano Kendra Colton _ that he has been named
composer-in-residence for the Emerging Artist series.
</P>
<P>
   Vores was born in Wales and went to university in Lancaster,
England; in those days he played drums and keyboards in rock bands.
At Lancaster he came into the orbit of the composer Edward Cowie
and decided that's what he wanted to do himself: write music. He
arrived at Tanglewood as a student in 1986; there he met the
talented collaborative pianist Patricia Thom, who is now his wife,
and the administrator of the Walnut Hill School in Natick. Vores
has lived in this country ever since. ``I think I was an American
born in an Englishman's body,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has more elaborate support systems for composers than
there are in this country, and more avenues to bring new work
forward more prominently. But Vores has not regretted his decision
to remain in America. ``The British musical scene is very cliquey,
and to that degree depressing. And most British composers complain
all the time about the same things American composers complain
about _ they can't get everything they want. I find the atmosphere
in America much less oppressive. There is a kind of house style in
English music _ bright, spiky, brittle, woodwind heavy _ that is
used by everyone, from the very talented, like Thomaas Ades and
Julian Anderson, on down the list. But it is really just one kind
of sound, and it is not my kind of sound _ I'm just not into that.
When I was at Tanglewood, I wrote a piece with a key signature, and
it was a kind of liberation. I discovered I didn't need to be
afraid I was going to be attacked by ravens!''
</P>
<P>
   Vores has been a popular figure on Boston's new-music scene for
most of the last 15 years, and he has achieved his prominence the
hard way, because he hasn't supported his composing by taking on a
full-time academic position. For many years, he worked as a music
copyist for other composers, although the music-copying business
has dried up these days because of developments in computer
software; now he teaches one seminar at Walnut Hill and relies on
the commissions that keep steadily coming in.
</P>
<P>
   Vores met David Hoose in 1989 and Hoose conducted the premiere
of Vores's delightful Virginia Woolf opera, ``Freshwater,'' at
Boston University in 1994. ``Freshwater'' seemed to have a future
as a workshop/adventuresome-small-company piece, but so far it
hasn't been produced since the premiere, although there have been
some near misses. Vores was particularly disappointed when a
production on the Isle of Wight, the setting for the opera, fell
through when the fund-raiser got sick. Through the years, Hoose and
Vores have spoken about the possibility of writing something for
the Cantata Singers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took the millennium to bring it about,'' Vores said. ``I
made a proposal and then we argued about texts for a while. I
should not say `argued.' We discussed texts, and then I wrote it.
When David asked me for a formal proposal, I had a library full of
texts I wanted to use some day. They didn't have much to do with
each other, so my first job was to create a framework within which
they could meet up and begin to mean something together.''
</P>
<P>
   The piece now falls into six movements, including the opening
orchestral ``Big Bang.'' ``Before and After Time'' features texts
from the Enuma Elish and the Egyptian Book of the Dead. ``The
Created Universe'' assembles texts from the Odyssey and the
Upanishads. ``Apocalyptic Visions'' draws on Suetonius's life of
Nero and the New Testament book of Revelations. ``Distant Shores''
sets passages from the Anglo-Saxon poem ``Deor'' and the Japanese
classic ``The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon.'' The final section,
``Future,'' sets poems by Peter Davison, Anne Waldman, and Liesel
Mueller. The music links and interprets the texts, associating each
movement with one of the primal elements (earth, air, fire, water);
a characteristic interval generates and governs the music in each
section, and in the end, the work returns to its beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Vores's Musica Viva piece, he says, ``is being written even as
we speak. It is a low and growly piece, but I hope a different kind
of low and growly piece. There is so much heavy, dark music in this
world; I want to write a fizzy dark piece! I chose an unusual
ensemble of low instruments for this because I am so tired of
hearing the new-music ensemble that has become standard since
Schoenberg's `Pierrot lunaire.' That's a great ensemble, but I
don't see any need for me to write for those sounds again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dark Mother,'' for Triple Helix, is a response to the myth of
Demeter and Persephone. ``It's not a narrative piece, but it
depicts the emotional landscape of that story. It begins with music
of burgeoning, unstoppable abundance. Then it moves into a section
of mourning, one long line that moves down from the top of the
violin to the bass of the cello. The third movement brings stasis,
and in the fourth movement we hear the invention of all the
seasons, which pass by in a procession to a kind of springlike
English round tune that gets faster and faster until the end. The
members of Triple Helix _ Bayla Keyes, Rhonda Rider, and Lois
Shapiro _ said they wanted a virtuosic piece, and that's what they
got.''
</P>
<P>
   Vores looks for nothing from his audiences beyond a degree of
open-mindedness. ``I don't care what people bring into Jordan Hall
_ although I would prefer they didn't bring their candy wrapped in
cellophane, their noisy bags from Stop and Shop, or their beepers
and cell phones! Actually at the end of `World Wheel,' they can
beep away all they want, because no one will hear them!''
</P>
<P>
   Vores is more eloquent on the subject of what he hopes the
audience will take away from next weekend's performances. ``One of
the reasons I wrote this piece is to recognize how far from an
absolute our own culture is. Some of the ancient civilizations long
outlasted ours, but they were transitory _ just as ours is likely
to be. I wasn't particularly interested in creating a politically
correct multicultural event. But I wanted to find expression for
the idea that no matter how alien a culture might feel to us, when
a culture comes down to individuals, their concerns are always the
same as ours are. This is not a revelation, of course, but I hope
the audience will like how the music sounds and get excited by it.
I want the audience to know how user-friendly my music is; I hope
people will find it worthwhile _ and then come back for more.''

EXPLORING THE LANGUAGE OF FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If film is truly an international language, count Polish-born
director Agnieszka Holland among its true multilingual talents. She
speaks seven languages and has made movies in four of them (Polish,
English, German, French). She has been nominated for Oscars for
``Europa, Europa'' and ``Angry Harvest,'' and is noted for the
serious nature of her films. (On her wish list: a comedy.)
</P>
<P>
   Holland's latest film, ``The Third Miracle,'' a spiritual
detective story set in Chicago, is in English. It stars her friend
and collaborator Ed Harris as a lapsed Catholic priest questioning
his faith, and Anne Heche as a feisty intellectual foil and
potential love interest.
</P>
<P>
   What are the advantages and disadvantages of working in English?
</P>
<P>
   ``My English is, of course, kind of basic,'' she says during an
interview at a Back Bay restaurant. ``It means I can feel the truth
of the acting, but I cannot really tell you the reality in the
dialogue _ I don't feel totally free in that. But English is, for
anything dramatical, for theater and for movies, one of the best
languages because it is very direct, very energetic, with natural
energy to it. And another advantage is that so many people over the
world understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Holland, the daughter of a nonpracticing Jewish father and a
nonpracticing Catholic mother, has, cinematically, dealt with
spiritual issues in the past. ``The Third Miracle'' concerns Father
Frank Shore's attempts to verify miracles performed in the name of
the late mother of Roxanna, Heche's character. Roxanna is an
adamant nonbeliever who feels she was mistreated or ignored by her
mother _ even as everyone else seems to consider her saintly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Third Miracle'' presents startling tales of mysterious,
unexplained healings, of Madonna statues that bleed, and of
skepticism about it all. It is the task of Father Frank, a
semiretired postulator (i.e., spiritual sleuth), to return to his
calling, that is, to investigate and determine whether the woman
should be recommended to move up the heavenly ladder toward
sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   Holland, 51, became interested in the Catholic Church as a
teenager, growing up in postwar Poland. It was a form of rebellion.
Her Communist parents ``would march against the Catholic Church for
many reasons,'' Holland recalls. ``I went to the church and the
religious classes in secret. It was kind of my opposition to their
very materialistic point of view, and it was kind of exciting, you
know, to be a martyr for the faith. I really had a strong sense of
the mystical and metaphysical content. And I was extremely touched
by the Gospel, the New Testament.''
</P>
<P>
   In her 20s, Holland moved away from the church. She questioned
the moral behavior of some of the priests; she was repulsed by an
anti-Semitic strain she felt the faith contained. But, she says,
``the questions the institution asks you are important to me and
that remained with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Holland, who also spoke via telephone from her daughter's home
in Los Angeles after the Boston interview, read the novel ``The
Third Miracle'' by American writer Richard Vetere, and, she says,
``had quite a strong reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had doubts (about filming it), of course,'' she continues,
``but what attracted me was the challenge: How do you make a
serious religious movie without doing it in a kind of horror, or
sexually colored, or special-effects way, to make it in a very
human way?'' She refers to ``The Exorcist'' and ``Priest'' as
movies that have gone down those particular paths.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A socio-psychological story
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Third Miracle'' begins with the German bombing of a
village in Slovakia during World War II. Quickly, Holland cuts to
1979 and we meet Father Frank, who has left the priesthood and
lives in a Chicago halfway house.
</P>
<P>
   ``What attracted me to `The Third Miracle' was that it doesn't
have a very clear kind of narrative form or style,'' Holland says.
``It starts very realistic, kind of a socio-psychological story.
And it changes to (be about) a real man,'' that is, Father Frank.
</P>
<P>
   Casting Harris was an integral part of getting the picture made.
She had directed him previously in ``To Kill a Priest'' (irony
noted, with a smile) and felt Father Frank was Harris and Harris
was Father Frank. ``That character is the main interest of the
story to me,'' says Holland. ``And when Ed decided that he was
interested, that he wanted to do it with me, then I knew it was
worth it to try. I knew one thing: I would not succeed with this
movie if I didn't have the actor who is soulful and deep enough to
make credible the struggles of this character.''
</P>
<P>
   The trust and friendship they had, she adds, gave them ``the
courage to go the places which are not obvious.'' Harris did not
demand the kind of money he earns in big budget Hollywood movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Third Miracle'' takes a series of twists, turns, and
shifts of emphasis as it delves into the internecine struggles of
the church's politicized hierarchy debating the validity of the
miracles and the checkered life of the potential saint. And you
feel Father Frank's conflict. He is torn between doubt and faith
(``someone who needs constant proof,'' says Holland) and, in the
physical realm, he is severely tempted by Heche's character. Father
Frank ``is not asexual,'' says Holland.
</P>
<P>
   Of Heche, she says, ``I think Anne is definitely one of the most
unique and talented actresses of her generation. And she's very
courageous. She doesn't have problems trying different things,
going over borders. And she has an incredible temperament. She
gives energy and life, which was extremely important in this story,
which has kind of a serious sense and kind of a depressed tone.''
</P>
<P>
   There is resolution in ``The Third Miracle,'' but some issues
are left open. Will ``The Third Miracle'' be a difficult movie for
people?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, for some people, maybe,'' Holland admits. ``There is not
a clear conclusion and that can be a problem because they are,
unfortunately, used to a very simplistic kind of story _ bad is
bad, right is right. But what I've seen from the (advance)
screenings is the people react quite emotionally. If you are able
to accept this kind of a subject, I think that the emotional
content of the movie is strong enough to take them on a journey.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the Catholic Church's response, says Holland, ``I don't
have that information, but I have the impression that it was quite
positive. Some reviews in Catholic newspapers were kind of nice.
Some priests were really touched because they found it an accurate
description of their problems. . . . We are not so sure about the
bishops. But what I love about the Church is that is it such a
complex institution, with all kinds of people and dimensions that
are so numerous _ political, economical, spiritual.''
</P>
<P>
   Holland does not make fun of those who do believe in miracles.
``I think it's fantastic, and I don't have these feelings that they
are backward and naive at all because they need some knd of `higher
power' to go with their life. Some people have the gift to believe
in it, and what was interesting for me was always when I met the
real intellectuals who are the believers. I met several people like
that, some highly regarded intellectuals who don't have doubt that
this exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always something to discourage us, yet on the other
hand, I was always more attracted to the people who are struggling,
who don't take anything for granted and need to constantly check
the reality of their faith and their decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Holland believe in miracles?
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, I am a typical person, like (Harris's)
character. I do believe and I don't believe. It's troubling. It's
not only (the question of) the miracles, there's also the existence
of something with such a strong definition like a `God.' Of some
kind of afterlife, of some kind of metaphysical presence. It is,
for me, an emotional and psychological game, at times. I cannot
tell you that I do believe, but I can tell you that I am open. . .
. I think it is too boring to accept (that) everything is dependent
on a rational explanation. I was too long living in a Communist
country to accept that. If miracles don't exist, you have to create
them.''

PRISTINE BUSTER KEATON PRESERVES THE GENIUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``The Art of Buster Keaton'' (DVD) _ Who can ever
tire of the genius of Buster Keaton? This marvelous set includes
most of the silent film star's great work, including ``The
General.'' The stone-faced comic is well served by the pristine
picture quality of the remastered titles. Kino on Video deserves
kudos for making these titles available, even though they're not a
box-office threat to James Bond or Austin Powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Extreme Adventures of Super Dave'' _ Super Dave Osborne,
played by Bob Einstein (Albert Brooks's brother), had a great run
as a comic version of Evel Knievel on his Showtime series. Einstein
knows how to use the variety-show format to poke fun at stuntmen
and show business. But the movies are another thing altogether. The
sense of spontaneity on the half-hour show _ though contrived _ did
give Super Dave a sense of immediacy. The movie's just a tired
replay as worn and tattered as one of Osborne's red, white, and
blue jumpsuits after a terrible accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Animal Farm'' _ This adaptation of George Orwell's allegorical
tale of tyranny and oppression is miraculous. Director John
Stephenson skillfully blends live action and animatronics to create
a believable world. Like the book, there are some violent moments.
Ultra-sensitive parents might want to prescreen the movie.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Snaking beneath the thin retina at the back of the eye, tiny
blood vessels grow where they shouldn't be growing, leaking blood
and fluid and buckling and damaging the light-sensitive tissue in
tens of thousands of people each year.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of this process, referred to as the ``wet'' form of
age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the central zone of vision
blurs and darkens, leaving a ring of less-sharp peripheral sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living with macular degeneration means living in a half-veiled
world,'' wrote Henry Grunwald, former editor in chief of Time, in a
recent account of his struggle to cope with this insidious disease.
</P>
<P>
   Until the last few years, there was no treatment for wet AMD,
except for blasting the abnormal blood vessels with a powerful
laser, which inevitably damaged the retina.
</P>
<P>
   But a new procedure conceived in Boston and tested at eye
centers in the United States and abroad is expected to be approved
by the US Food and Drug Administration, possibly as soon as next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Called photodynamic therapy, or PDT, it attacks the rogue blood
vessels, which doctors fill with a light-sensitive dye that is then
activated by a laser that is beamed through the pupil. This
chemical reaction destroys the tiny vessels and seals off the
bleeding, without damaging the overlying retina's vision cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first treatment (for wet macular degeneration)
that's been shown effective in large clinical trials,'' said Dr.
Joan Miller, an eye surgeon at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear
Infirmary, where the procedure was developed. Miller and her
colleague, Dr. Evangelos S. Gragoudas, suggested as far back as
1991 that PDT, which has previously been used in treating cancer,
might be a novel weapon against wet macular degeneration.
</P>
<P>
   AMD, in its wet form and the more common but less severe ``dry''
form, is the leading cause of severe vision loss in people over 50,
affecting an estimated 25 to 30 million people worldwide. Most of
the serious vision loss is caused by the wet form, which involves
the leaking, abnormal blood vessels. It strikes about 10 to 15
percent of all AMD patients.
</P>
<P>
   The exact cause isn't known, but risk factors, in addition to
age, may include genetics, smoking, cataracts, excessive sun
exposure, and a diet low in certain antioxidants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Macular'' in AMD refers to the macula, the circle of
densely-packed light-sensing cells in the center of the retina,
which are used for reading and detailed vision. When the macula is
damaged, a person loses central vision, often forcing him or her to
give up driving, making reading difficult or impossible, and
blotting out the details of faces.
</P>
<P>
   Patients often become dependent on low-vision aids _ like
magnifiers and reading machines _ and on human helpers. As their
world shrinks, they may become withdrawn and depressed.
</P>
<P>
   The new treatment, PDT, is not a cure. Nor does it bring back
vision that's been lost. But in many cases it can prevent the
disease from worsening _ for how long isn't yet known _ and it has
even slightly improved sight in a small number of volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neil Bressler, a Johns Hopkins School of Medicine
ophthalmologist, said that while the treatment won't enable
patients to resume driving, for example, it will help preserve
vision, ``so that it's more likely you can do more things for
yourself, like using magnification aids to read your bills, so you
don't have to wait for your daughter to come over and read them for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Eye and Ear's Miller and Gragoudas carried out
animal tests that demonstrated the effectiveness of PDT and
established treatment guidelines. They then led clinical tests that
began in 1995 and produced favorable results that CIBAVision, of
Duluth, Ga., submitted to the FDA seeking approval to commercialize
it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first patients to be treated in the clinical trial
was Suzanne Deuchler, 70, of Aurora, Ill. She said recently that
PDT treatments at Mass Eye and Ear have enabled her to continue her
political lobbying work in Illinois, where she is a former member
of the state legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have pretty much held my own'' against the disease since
entering the PDT clinical trial in 1996, she said in a recent
interview after her latest dye-and-laser treatment. Following a few
sessions, she's actually found her vision not just stabilized but
improved slightly. ``I could look at the hands and numbers of my
watch, and they were much sharper,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Regan, a 67-year-old electronics engineer, got PDT
treatment in his left eye, which was virtually blinded by wet
macular degeneration.
</P>
<P>
   After several treatments, he says, ``I have now recovered a
great deal of the sense of an image. It's poorly defined; it's
mottled and distorted as if looking through a Coke bottle bottom _
but it's better than it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those most enthusiastic about PDT caution that it is not a
magic bullet for wet AMD. Only about 30 percent of people with the
problem will be good candidates, based on the location of the
leaking vessels. In addition, because the vessels often grow back,
most patients in the trials have needed repeated treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ``I think the enthusiasm is totally justified, and
I think it will be widely used,'' said Dr. Carmen Puliafito,
director of the New England Eye Center, where about 100 macular
degeneration patients underwent PDT treatment as part of the
clinical trials. ``There was nothing we could do about this in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   PDT treatment takes only a half-hour or so, and begins with an
intravenous injection of the light-sensitive dye into the patient's
arm. The dye makes its way through the circulation and accumulates
in the abnormal blood vessels beneath the retina. After 15 minutes,
the doctor shines a low-powered laser through the pupil: when it
hits the dye in the abnormal blood vessels, the dye releases
substances that destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   The patient has to wear dark glasses and stay away from sunshine
and fluorescent lights for a few days, but otherwise there are no
apparent side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, researchers published results of the latest phase of
the PDT clinical trials, comparing patients who received the
light-sensitive drug and laser treatment to those who got an
inactive placebo drug by injection.
</P>
<P>
   One year after treatment, 61 percent of those who received the
active drug had a small or no loss of vision, compared to 46
percent of those on the placebo. That's significant, though not
dramatic. But in a subgroup of patients who had what's called the
``classic'' form of wet AMD, meaning that the errant blood vessels
are growing under the center of the retina and their extent is
well-defined, the results were stronger: 67 percent of the treated
volunteers lost little vision, compared to 39 percent of placebo
patients.
</P>
<P>
   There's similar optimism at CIBAVision, which is marketing the
treatment under the name Visudyne. (A separate company, QLT
PhotoTherapeutics of Vancouver, makes the Visudyne dye.) ``We feel
confident'' that the agency will act favorably, said Stephen Lang,
a marketing executive with CIBA Vision. The procedure is expected
to cost about $1,500 per treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Because most AMD patients are on Medicare, the cost of
treatments _ and retreatments _ presumably will fall mainly on the
federal government. Reimbursement policy won't be set until the
treatment wins FDA approval, said a spokesman for the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Some eye specialists want to see more data on PDT's
effectiveness before they wholeheartedly endorse it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear how much you're gaining'' in extra months or
years of vision, said Dr. Michael Marmor, a retina specialist at
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it turns out that 80 percent of people stabilize with
useful reading vision for five years, then it would be
worthwhile,'' said Marmor, speaking on behalf of the American
Academy of Ophthalmology. ``But if you're only prolonging useful
vision by three to five months, then I don't think it's
economically reasonable in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Marmor, however, called the technique ``powerful'' and said
research should continue in hopes of improving PDT's effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   What is not clear from the trials so far is how frequently
patients may need retreatments to shut down maverick blood vessels
that regrow following PDT. In the clinical trials, most patients
needed retreatment, some as often as every three months. Miller at
Mass Eye and Ear says that after several treatments the blood
vessels may be less prone to re-forming, but only longer followup
will determine that.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other efforts to combat wet AMD continue. Some
researchers are working with angiogenesis inhibitors, substances
that curb the growth of new blood vessels. None has yet proven
successful, but research go``There's huge interest in
angiogenesis inhibitors here,'' said senior scientist Ann Elsner at
the Schepens Eye Research Institute in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   What has driven her to spend the past 12 years trying to find
answers to macular degeneration, she said, ``is that we see the
awful outcome every day. It's just a huge public health problem.''

AT MCLEAN, LIVES INTERRUPTED _ AND HEALED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The urge to write about crossing the line into a ``parallel
universe,'' and her nearly two-year stay at McLean Hospital in the
1960s, came to Susanna Kaysen while she was penning a novel about
an anthropologist living in foreign lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminded me of being plopped down'' at the Belmont, Mass.
psychiatric hospital, said Kaysen, 51, author of the 1993 memoir
``Girl, Interrupted,'' which became a surprise bestseller and
serves as the basis for the new movie of the same name starring
Winona Ryder.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, the day the movie opened nationwide, Kaysen
returned to McLean to talk about her experiences there to current
and former patients and staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to be back at McLean. It's such a pleasure to just
(be able to) leave,'' said Kaysen to laughter. More than 350 people
attended the meeting, titled ``Psychiatric care from the consumer
point of view: Past, present and future.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaysen was admitted to McLean with ``borderline personality,'' a
diagnosis that she only learned about years later, and that she
eloquently dissects and ultimately discards in a chapter of her
book.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview and during the talk, Kaysen described the good
and the bad aspects of her hospital stay, which began after she
made a brief visit to a psychiatrist as a teen-ager in the
turbulent 1960s, seeking ``a rest,'' she said, and help with
self-destructive thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   While Kaysen spoke of her hospitalization more than 30 years
ago, another former patient talked of her healing stays at McLean
in the 1990s, and staff members discussed how care has changed in
the last 30 years, with patients more involved now as partners in
treatment and diagnosis, new medications, and insurers' limits on
lengths of stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were so many things I loved about the old McLean,''
particularly the number of staff available to complain to, Kaysen
said during the talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I had a bad time there. Some of it I hated. Some
of it I didn't hate. . . . Like most things in life, it was a mixed
experience,'' she added in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl, Interrupted'' provides a snapshot in time, in America,
and in psychiatric care, featuring vignettes of fellow patients and
of life on a locked ward.
</P>
<P>
   But it also addresses universal themes of emotional pain and
healing, and highlights some of the issues that are still debated
in psychiatry today: ambiguous diagnoses, questionable or unproven
treatments, and the role that patients play in their own healing.
</P>
<P>
   Girls and young women who have perhaps had some of the same
suicidal thoughts and self-destructive behaviors that Kaysen did as
an 18-year-old have been some of the biggest fans of the book.
</P>
<P>
   Winona Ryder, who plays the young Kaysen, knew she wanted to
make a movie based on the book after she read it, she has said in
interviews. The movie, loosely based on the book, was filmed at a
hospital in Pennsylvania. McLean declined to serve as the location
for the filming to protect patient confidentiality, although the
hospital allowed a film crew to take environmental shots.
</P>
<P>
   And while many things have changed at McLean and other
psychiatric hospitals since the 1960s, Kaysen's questioning of the
diagnosis she was given and other aspects of her hospitalization
resonates with many psychiatrists and patients.
</P>
<P>
   One professional man who checked himself into McLean one
Saturday night last year, because he was feeling anxious and having
trouble with the medication he was taking for manic depression,
criticized the hospital for not letting him leave the next morning,
as promised, when it turned out that no doctor was available to see
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was upsetting,'' said the man, who did not want his name
used. While his other experiences with McLean have been positive,
this one was clearly not. He ultimately was able to sneak out of
the unit.
</P>
<P>
   McLean is a storied place of lives interrupted, and often
healed. Poets Sylvia Plath and Robert Lowell were once hospitalized
there. So were musicians Ray Charles and siblings James,
Livingston, and Kate Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   One of James Taylor's early songs, ``Knocking 'Round the Zoo,''
is said to have been about his experience there as a teen-ager, and
his better-known ``Fire and Rain'' is also said to have been
inspired by that period.
</P>
<P>
   And the nursery rhyme ``Mary Had a Little Lamb'' was written in
the 1800s about a McLean nurse who once had a lamb that followed
her everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard psychiatrist Stephen Bergman _ who used the pen name
Samuel Shem to write the 1997 satirical novel ``Mount Misery,''
which some say is loosely based on McLean _ criticized today's
psychiatric hospitals for spending too little time establishing
human connections with patients, and too much time giving them
medications, largely as a result of insurance restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   If a teen-age girl today facing the same issues that Kaysen
confronted in the 1960s needed psychiatric care, ``what would
happen to her now? She wouldn't even get admitted,'' said Bergman,
who knows Kaysen and called her book ``wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if psychiatric care has changed because of insurance,
Kaysen concluded her remarks last Friday at the Belmont hospital by
saying, ``I'm glad that there's still a McLean.''

EARLY WINS MAY MEAN LITTLE FOR BRADLEY AND MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Although underdogs Bill Bradley and John McCain are focused on
a New Hampshire primary they cannot afford to lose, the fate of
their presidential campaigns may well lie in other key states.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Bradley, a Democrat, and McCain, a Republican, win their
primaries in the Granite State, both know that March may still
bring political Armageddon.
</P>
<P>
   If Bradley wins in New Hampshire on Feb. 1 and New York on March
7 but loses the California primary (also March 7) to Vice President
Al Gore, the front-runner, he might as well bid farewell to his
chances of being the next president.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, meanwhile, is doing well in New Hampshire and may even
win that contest. But in the primaries that follow, polls show, his
strength goes downhill faster than a skier in the Granite State's
White Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Winning New Hampshire, which is by no means guaranteed, will
keep the Bradley and McCain campaigns alive, but only a month
longer. Most of the March primaries appear to heavily favor Gore
and Republican George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A poll of voters, conducted by Quinnipiac College in Hamden,
Conn., and released Thursday, gave Bradley a lead of 47 percent to
37 percent over Gore in the New Hampshire primary. But the same
poll showed that 64 percent of the likely Democratic voters expect
Gore to win the nomination, as opposed to 18 percent for Bradley.
These voters do not think that Bradley can win enough state
primaries to gain the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also painted a similar scenario for McCain. While he
leads Bush in New Hampshire, 37 percent to 28 percent, 65 percent
of those polled believe Bush will win the nomination compared with
11 percent who expect McCain to be the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Other national polls outline essentially the same scenario. A
recent CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll asked Republican and Democratic
voters whom they would most likely support for their party's
nomination. Among Republicans and those leaning Republican, 63
percent supported Bush and 18 percent were for McCain. Each of the
four other GOP contenders, Steve Forbes, Orrin Hatch, Alan Keyes,
and Gary Bauer, received 5 percent or less.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, Bush has a commanding lead over McCain.
Indeed, Bush holds the lead in Southern primaries overall.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bradley, even if he does well in New Hampshire, New York,
and Massachusetts, his biggest test will come in the California
primary. If he wins it, his candidacy is likely to surge, creating
a serious battle for the nomination at the Democratic National
Convention this summer. But if Bradley loses California, that could
be the end of his campaign, since most of the Southern primaries
appear locked up for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   While these and other polls don't mean that Bradley's and
McCain's presidential bids are futile, they certainly indicate the
rough road ahead _ even if they can turn a New Hampshire victory
into increased support in future contests, as candidates in past
years have sometimes done.
</P>
<P>
   Another key factor that may also be working against Bradley and
McCain is the makeup of their campaign staffs. Both Gore and Bush
have seasoned campaigners on their staff, more so than Bradley or
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Gore has Michael Whouley, the person who guided
Clinton through the Gennifer Flowers episode that nearly wrecked
his campaign at the outset. Whouley and a number of other veteran
campaign advisers give Gore a competitive edge over Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for Bush. Not only does Bush have money to burn in
his bid to become the next president, he has the help of veteran
advisers from his father's national campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Bush have advisers who can help them overcome
campaign blunders, while Bradley and McCain are more vulnerable to
rookie mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   However much the battles for the Democratic and Republican
nominations may be predetermined, the underdogs maintain hope in
the unexpected _ that something will happen to change the odds.
</P>
<P>
   But if Bush and Gore do not encounter major problems along the
way to their national conventions, there is very little that
Bradley and McCain can do to change the likely outcome.

&HT;     HILLARY CLINTON'S GAME OF SOFTBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN LYNCH  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Essentially, politics is about being liked. You
lose elections if you rub people the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   And, since most people who run for office aren't at all like the
rest of us _ they tend to be tougher, hungrier for power and more
eager for attention _ politics is also about artifice. It's about
conveying the often erroneous impression that you're a nice person
even though many of the personal traits you'll need to win election
aren't nice at all.
</P>
<P>
   So it was no surprise that Hillary Rodham Clinton popped up on
David Letterman's show the other night, exuding warmth and wit
while maintaining steadfast aloofness from any more penetrating
media setting. She even had her own ``Top 10 List.'' If you watched
this thing, you wouldn't have been surprised to see the first lady
burst into a chorus of, ``Lullaby of Broadway'' or launch into a
stand-up routine. (``Take my husband _ please.'')
</P>
<P>
   New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani also has done Letterman on
several occasions. He even popped up once in drag for a ``Saturday
Night Live'' gig. There's a long tradition of this sort of stuff.
Candidate Bill Clinton played his sax on Arsenio Hall's program.
Even Richard Nixon once went on Jack Paar's show to play the piano
and, years later, on ``Laugh In'' to mutter darkly into the camera,
``Sock it to me?''
</P>
<P>
   Once, when asked if he agreed that Lionel Barrymore was
America's greatest actor, Franklin Delano Roosevelt disputed that
assessment. America's greatest actor, the president said, was
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, today's seamless web of entertainment, journalism
and politics has distinctly disturbing overtones. It's not that
there's anything really shameful about President Clinton revealing
on MTV what type of underwear he wears _ briefs, not shorts _
especially considering his other, more disturbing proclivities. But
it is undignified. Abe Lincoln had a vibrant sense of humor, but he
surely wouldn't have answered that. Harry Truman would have sent
the kid on MTV to his room with no TV.
</P>
<P>
   Why do the politicians do it? To sell themselves. They do it
because they perceive that we demand it. They do it because they
understand that getting elected in a nation of television addicts
requires connecting with those entertainment junkies _ to the
people who know Letterman but never heard of Tim Russert, Sam
Donaldson or Jim Lehrer.
</P>
<P>
   Which is fine except, more and more, politicians who used to
seek news coverage now avoid it. They now understand that they can
get out their messages just the way they want them presented
through paid advertising provided by contributors who always want
something back in the form of tax dollars. And now they're moving
with great glee to settings like the Letterman show where they know
they'll be pitched softballs _ where they know, essentially, that
nobody will ask them a hard question, nobody will try to reveal to
the public anything about them that they don't want revealed.
</P>
<P>
   So, now Larry King _ the unchallenged champion of the softball
pitchers _ passes for a journalist in the eyes of so many.
Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton refuses any substantial news interview
in New York, where she's supposed to be running for the U.S.
Senate. She uses Secret Service agents to keep reporters at bay as
though they were ... well, mere citizens.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad for democracy. Ultimately, it's bad for anybody who
believes that people have a right to information that'll better
enable them to govern themselves. The problem is that so many
people demand nothing of politicians but smiles and yuks. In the
end, though, it's not about who's warm and amusing.
</P>
<P>
   It's about who can do the job.

<P>
   BIG BEND RANCH STATE PARK, Texas _ It's midmorning in September
and the West Texas sun is already shining hot on the back of my
neck.
</P>
<P>
   The silent, sparkling slow sunrise is over, and I stand outside
the corral, kicking up dust with my boots, waiting.
</P>
<P>
   There is no wind, no birdsong, and no highway noise. Just the
sound of six very annoyed camels getting saddled.
</P>
<P>
   Camels. West Texas. Me.
</P>
<P>
   It's day two of this trail ride and the absurdity of the
situation _ me on a camel in Texas _ hasn't worn off. It doesn't
matter that I know camels were used by the cavalry in Texas before
the Civil War. Yes, camels were in competition with horses as part
of an experiment to see which made the better pack animal.
</P>
<P>
   But that was a very long time ago, and camels really do look
strange crossing the desert of West Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Braaaaaaangh,'' fills the still, dusty air, drowning out the
confused braying of the camels' equine neighbors. I watch the
saddling process, my eyes fixed on Brutus, the camel I will ride.
</P>
<P>
   He is nearly 4 feet taller than I am, tied to a rail in the
corral. He's already been saddled, and waits, silently, looking
down his nose at me, the plebian who is about to mount him. I wipe
a little sweat off my upper lip and try to look cool by perching my
cowboy booted foot on one of the bottom rails, the way I have seen
mean hombres do in old Westerns.
</P>
<P>
   My foot slips off, pitching me forward like Chevy Chase doing
his best Gerald Ford schtick. Brutus simply turns and looks the
other way.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think it's a good sign. And today, I want nothing but
good omens.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the first day of the trail ride, I spent six hours on
a camel and now my nether region is numb, chafed and bruised. I
have no idea what another six hours will do to me. Do people
spontaneously break in half the way some spontaneously combust?
</P>
<P>
   What really frightens me is that yesterday was the easy ride
according to Doug Baum, the owner of this camel outfit. Baum has
owned and operated the Texas Camel Corps for six years,
participating in parades, school programs, cavalry march
re-enactments across the state, and organizing trail rides through
state parks. In the past he had rides through Arizona, but is now
concentrating on Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Today is the challenging ride where we go up steep hills, and
(more frighteningly) down steep hills where the camels have a
tendency to trot. Up and down. And that makes me go up and down.
And I just don't know if my bottom can handle that.
</P>
<P>
   My neurotic flow is interrupted when Baum shouts at me from the
corral, ``Hey, Emily, you're up!''
</P>
<P>
   Ohmylordhelpmeplease.
</P>
<P>
   I walk through the corral to Brutus, who sits kneeling in the
center. I try to walk with a confident swagger. Can't horses smell
fear? Maybe camels can, too. Unfortunately, Brutus misreads my cool
mosey for a simple case of bowlegged saddle soreness, and he
doesn't look impressed. Of coarse, the beast has a schnoz the size
of the Texas Panhandle, which would give anyone a perpetually
haughty, mildly repulsed look.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I can win him over with a flawless mount. Left foot in the
stirrup, swing the right leg over, land as softly as a pile as
feathers, I think, repeating Baum's advice.
</P>
<P>
   But my leg doesn't quite clear Brutus' 6-foot hump, and I land
more like a lump of lead. A very sore, nervous lump of lead. I
swear that camel shakes his head at me.
</P>
<P>
   I brace myself for liftoff as Brutus stands, back end first,
then the front. He takes his first step, I settle onto the hard
metal and leather saddle, and pain is instant. But then,
gloriously, comes the numbness.
</P>
<P>
   Like the day before, I am the last in line on the ride. I have
an intriguing view of five camel rumps when I look straight ahead.
So instead, I try to take in the scenery around me: sharp red rock
peaks against a clear blue sky and miles of brown earth. We covered
12 miles the first day, and should do nine miles today.
</P>
<P>
   The sway of Brutus' walking combined with the silence and clean
air and humbling surroundings to lull me into a peaceful,
contemplative state. Even with five other people on the ride, the
single-file nature makes conversation a little difficult.

CAN MCCAIN PULL OFF A POLITICAL THREE-FER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MADISON, Iowa _ John McCain has pulled off a rare three-fer
for conservatives in advocating an economic policy that reforms
Social Security, cuts taxes for the middle-class, and supports the
prospering economy instead of threatening it.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has also challenged what remains of right-wing orthodoxy
by daring to make a proposal that doesn't place marginal tax rates
for those few at the top of the earnings curve at the center of the
universe. For this, talk of apostasy is in the air, but it is the
essence of reformers like McCain not to notice.
</P>
<P>
   The question remains whether McCain's bold move will help him in
his long-shot attempt to pull off another three-fer _ whether he
can survive his formal absence from the caucuses here, win the New
Hampshire primary, and add tangible momentum next month in South
Carolina, Michigan, and his home state of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least two clues _ one from Steve Forbes, the other
from George W. Bush _ that he may be on to something.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has gone to ground here, off on a perpetual motion bus
tour that treats each stop as a dry-run exercise in mobilizing
attenders to the Jan. 24 caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   When the Forbes caravan arrives, abortion is the big topic.
Forbes tries to convince people that his conversion to pure
right-to-lifers from the libertarian of 1996 is for real and that
they shouldn't waste a vote on Gary Bauer or the current hot
candidate in the boonies, Alan Keyes. When he talks, litmus paper
fills the air _ about vice presidential picks, judicial nominees,
and the hardline policy plank in the GOP platform. Behind the
campaigning, the bulk of the Forbes money here is being spent on an
emotion-tugging antiabortion TV commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes almost never come up. The guy who got on the map in '96
with tax-cutting as his mantra rarely sells it.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that hardly anybody cares. Forbes is trying to
reach normal people, at least by economic standards. The theory is
endlessly repeated that taxes, especially income tax rates, are the
defining issue for the Republican Party and that therefore McCain
is courting disaster by proposing the smallest of the GOP tax cut
plans. Out here it is obvious that this isn't true. The focus of
McCain on Social Security, on the middle-class, and on not throwing
the entire anticipated budget surplus at one target is more
down-to-earth.
</P>
<P>
   The clue supplied by Bush is just as interesting because it is
almost entirely off the point. The message is the same in person
and in his advertising: The choice is between giving the surplus
back to the people or leaving it in Washington to be spent by the
hated bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from its silliness, Bush's recitation _ along with an
untrue denial that his own tax proposal would blow the entire
non-Social Security surplus _ gives McCain an opening through which
he is trying to move. Three points stand out.
</P>
<P>
   In the first place, McCain's economic plan is unique in its
dedication of more than 60 percent of the non-Social Security
surplus to an additional investment in Social Security. By doing
this, he provides the funds to pay for a transition to an idea most
conservatives favor _ letting workers dedicate a fifth of their
Social Security taxes to investment funds they would control. By
not doing this, Bush guarantees that when the country's demographic
time bomb explodes, some kind of reduction in existing benefits
levels will be unavoidable. In conservative terms, in other words,
McCain has a Social Security position that is both more responsible
and forward looking than Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   McCain would also dedicate a large chunk of change _ more than
10 percent of any surplus _ to shoring up Medicare, whose solvency,
again within existing benefits levels, will disappear in roughly 15
years unless tough choices are made now. He also will please
conservatives by having proposed an expansion of tax-favored
savings accounts for medical expenses. By contrast, health care is
not even on Bush's radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, McCain has concentrated his limited tax-cutting on the
middle-class _ by doubling the child care tax credit (as Bush
does), by offering a large increase in the standard deduction, and
by widely spreading the applicability of the lowest (15 percent)
income tax rate.
</P>
<P>
   What true believers claim is ``class warfare,'' McCain calls
common sense. Bush wastes most of his tax cut by slashing the top
and middle rate, thus putting 60 percent of the bucks into lower
taxes for the top 10 percent in income-earners and roughly
one-third to the top one percent. By aiming more carefully at the
middle-class, McCain strikes a blow for the hoary and apparently
out-of-date conservative concept of fiscal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Bushies are convinced McCain has given them the nomination.
We'll see, but there's no reason McCain's emphasis on Social
Security and Medicare won't appeal to relatively elderly states
like New Hampshire and even Iowa. But the best evidence is Forbes
and Bush. Their reactions to McCain reek of defensiveness, and the
Arizona senator has yet to retreat an inch.

THE MEDIA'S ANTIGUN BIAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The labels ``lobby'' and ``special interest group'' are rarely
used by journalists to describe lobbies or special interest groups
like the American Association of Retired Persons, the American
Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP, or Handgun Control Inc. But when
they refer to the National Rifle Association, ``lobby'' is
frequently the first word that springs to mind.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of many anomalies documented by Brian Patrick, a
University of Michigan scholar who spent a year comparing the
coverage of the NRA in several prestigious newspapers _ The New
York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles
Times, and Christian Science Monitor _ with the coverage of the
four other groups. He dissected some 1,500 published articles,
columns, editorials, and letters, and his findings are striking.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA, Patrick shows, is less likely than the others to be
identified by its proper name but much more likely to be tagged
with some variant of ``lobby'' or ``special interest.'' The ACLU
will typically be labeled a ``civil liberties group,'' ``abortion
rights group,'' or ``leading liberal champion.'' Handgun Control
Inc. is usually identified as a ``citizens' lobby,'' ``nonprofit
organization,'' or ``public interest group.'' The NAACP is referred
to as a ``national civil rights group,'' ``venerable civil rights
organization,'' or ``the nation's oldest and largest civil rights
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the NRA is in the news, the tone and terminology are
often very different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Semi-automatic caucus.'' ``Lobbying juggernaut.'' ``Powerful
gun lobby.'' ``Gun organization.'' ``Radical gun lobby.'' ``The
classic Washington superlobby.'' ``Arrogant lobby.'' ``The gun
lobby consisting of everything from neo-Nazis to nature-loving
hunters.'' ``Most feared lobby.'' ``The Beltway's loudest lobby.''
``A rich and paranoid organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of negative or positive labels was only one of 16
different categories Patrick devised for measuring bias in
newspaper coverage of the NRA. Many of his yardsticks are shrewd;
all are revealing.
</P>
<P>
   Example: More than 27 percent of stories about the liberal
interest groups _ the NAACP, AARP, ACLU, and Handgun Control _ were
accompanied by photographs of the groups' officials or events. Only
6 percent of the NRA stories were similarly dressed up.
</P>
<P>
   Example: When NRA officials were quoted, they were identified by
their proper titles less than 20 percent of the time. For Handgun
Control, by contrast, the proportion was 64 percent; for the NAACP,
73 percent. Thus Sarah Brady is the ``Handgun Control president,''
while Wayne LaPierre becomes merely an ``NRA lobbyist'' (he is the
group's executive vice president).
</P>
<P>
   Example: When information comes from the AARP, the papers use
verbs like ``reported,'' ``indicated,'' ``concludes,''
``documents.'' When the NAACP is quoted, the stories note that it
``spoke out,'' ``vowed,'' ``declared,'' ``announced.'' But when the
NRA speaks, the papers often choose verbs that imply doubt:
``claims,'' ``asserts,'' ``likes to portray,'' ``contended,''
``alleging.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick sifts his data with the statistical rigor one would
expect of a Michigan PhD. But his bottom line is unambiguous:
``These data support a conclusion of systematic marginalization of
the NRA.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he might have added, of guns and gun owners in general.
</P>
<P>
   On no other issue is there a wider gulf between mainstream
America and the media. There are more than 225 million civilian
firearms in the United States. Some 45 percent of US households own
at least one gun. To tens of millions of Americans, guns mean
safety and peace of mind; they know intuitively what statistics
prove: gun ownership reduces crime.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the nation's eminent newsrooms, it is axiomatic that guns
are nasty, that more guns mean more crime, and that those who
defend the Second Amendment are ``gun nuts.'' No wonder the NRA
gets such bad press. And no wonder so many gun owners have
abandoned newspapers as their chief source of information.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's TV.
</P>
<P>
   A detailed new study by the Media Research Center finds that in
the 24 months ending June 1999, the morning and evening news shows
on the major networks aired an astonishing 653 stories dealing with
gun policy. Of those, 393 clearly went beyond straight reporting
into advocacy _ and nearly 91 percent pressed an anti-gun point of
view.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, ABC's ``Good Morning America'' aired 93 segments
on gun policy; 92 had a progun control slant. CNN's nightly show,
``The World Today,'' broadcast 98 soundbites urging more gun
restrictions, but only 40 opposing them.
</P>
<P>
   The MRC study (read it at www.mrc.org) assembles a remarkable
array of gun-bashing rhetoric from TV talking heads. Juan Williams
on Fox: ``I don't understand why we're piddling around. We should
talk about getting rid of guns in this country.'' Geraldo Rivera on
CNBC: ``How much longer are we gonna be wrapping in the flag of
patriotism to justify 250 million guns out there?'' Roger
Rosenblatt on PBS: ``If you took away the guns, and I mean really
take away the guns, not what Congress is doing now, you would see
that violent society diminish considerably.''
</P>
<P>
   This bigotry against guns is irrational. It convinces millions
of Americans that the media cannot be trusted. Someday the networks
may figure out that in a land where almost one household in two
owns a gun, demonizing gun owners makes no sense. But by then, who
will be tuned in?

   &UR; BIG BEND RANCH STATE PARK, Texas: x x x a little difficult. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I find that when I don't actually think about how my head is 14
feet off the ground and that a snake could dart out at any moment
and spook the camels, then I'm actually quite calm. Luckily the
couple of snakes, quails, jackrabbits and turkey buzzards that we
saw were far enough away not to spook the camels.
</P>
<P>
   Still, simply entertaining thoughts like those are an
irresistible invitation to disaster.
</P>
<P>
   We've maneuver a couple of hills without incident. But then we
veer off the trail and head through acres of thick, sharp-thorned
scrub to reach a dry creek bed that we'll follow to our next stop
for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Camels don't have hooves. They have thick, wide feet that are
designed to keep them afloat on sand. So rocky, uneven terrain is
not their ideal environment. And because they are tied to each
other caravan-style, when one camel loses his footing and starts
sliding/trotting down the side of a steep hill, getting close to
plunging into a ravine, the other camels follow.
</P>
<P>
   From my vantage point at the back of the line, I watch,
petrified, as that problem strikes just three camels ahead. It
really does look like a train wreck. Chug starts to panic about
getting through a narrow downhill pass and runs into Irenie, the
camel next to him. When he does, he slams the foot of Bobbie
Alford, the rider, into the metal frame of Irenie's saddle. She
screams.
</P>
<P>
   I guess Chug didn't want that to happen again, because at the
next narrow pass, rather than play follow-the-camel, he decides to
blaze his own trail along the edge of a ravine. In the process, he
loses his footing and almost sends them both over the edge. Really
panicked now, he freezes there, his rope pulling other camels
closer to the edge, too.
</P>
<P>
   But Brutus, realizing what's happening and anticipating his own
downfall, carefully steps to the side with no direction from me,
avoiding the five-camel pileup. Pileups are bad because when camels
aren't moving forward, they want to kneel down, or ``coush.'' And
when one goes down, all the others start getting ideas, and then
it's so hard to get them all up again at the same time and moving
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Brutus, however, letting his true noble side shine, stays up,
even when all the camels around him are dropping like fumigated
flies. Brutus, the bane of my trip, has become my hero. I lean
forward, risking being impaled from the metal saddle horn, and pat
his hump. I think he turns to look at me and I swear he was
winking. (So what if I can only see one eye?)
</P>
<P>
   After that, he steers clear of thorny branches rather than
suspiciously head toward ones at my face level. After that, I feel
much more calm and in control. I'm even rather entertained by the
drama of subsequent pileups. I think Brutus and I bonded.
</P>
<P>
   So when I get off that camel for lunch, the swagger in my walk
is more than just crippling pain and swelling. I'm a real cowgirl.
I am tough. Man, I rode that camel.

CHARITY FINDS A HOME ON THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In years past, Arthur Schmidt cultivated what might be called
``a paper bag strategy'' for his charitable giving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw all the requests from nonprofits into a paper bag and
started sifting through them in mid-December,'' said Schmidt,
president of Philanthropic Research Inc. in Williamsburg, Va. ``But
that's pretty stupid, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he tossed out the paper bag and made his donations on
the Internet. He is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, charity has exploded on line, with
scores of Web sites being launched to promote charitable giving and
to raise funds in a variety of ways. Some shopping sites, such as
www.greatergood.com and www.igive.com, donate a small commission
from sales to the buyers' favorite cause, while other sites serve
as clearinghouses for donations.
</P>
<P>
   Technology not only makes it easier for individuals to donate to
their favorite causes 24 hours a day, seven days a week, but it
also provides users with more information than ever before, forcing
nonprofits to be more accountable to their supporters.
</P>
<P>
   In October, for instance, Schmidt's organization launched
www.guidestar.org, a Web site that posts the IRS forms that
charities file with the federal government, providing instant
access to information about how nonprofits use their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is the next big wave,'' said Jennifer Dunlop,
senior vice president of the American Red Cross. She said
e-philanthropy, as the trend is called, is the biggest change to
hit the fund-raising world since CNN began broadcasting in the
early '80s, beaming news about international disasters into living
rooms at all hours of the day. ``That caused a huge philanthropic
outpouring in this country, and this is going to be just as big,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The field is too new to gauge across the board, but it is
growing substantially. In fiscal year 1998, the Red Cross raised
$170,000 on its Web site; in fiscal year 1999 (which ended July 1),
that figure grew to $2.5 million. Likewise, the America Online
Foundation's philanthropy portal, www.helping.org, has raised
$500,000 for thousands of nonprofit organizations since it started
up in October, said AOL Foundation president David Eisner. And a
site called www.charitygift.com, a new service that enables people
to present charitable donations as gifts, raised $160,000 in its
first eight weeks of existence.
</P>
<P>
   New sites emerge every day. This month, local philanthropist and
businessman Steve Grossman is debuting www.givenation.com, a
charity portal that aims to create a community of givers. On the
site, users can read news about philanthropy, make credit card
gifts to hundreds of nonprofits, and establish memorials for family
and friends. ``This is a huge opportunity to create a nation of
givers,'' said Grossman, the former head of the Democratic National
Committee. ``Americans are charitable people, and if they are shown
a way to give efficiently and effectively, we think they will do so
in droves.''
</P>
<P>
   Givenation and sites like it aim to attract users like George
Gagliardi, a Web-savvy Concord, Mass. consultant. Last year, he and
his wife gave about $8,000 to charity, almost of all of it through
the Internet. ``I like to do things as efficiently as possible,''
he said, adding that he researches charities at www.give.org, a
site run by the National Charities Information Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Internet provides great educational potential for
motivated donors, it is also plagued with the potential for fraud.
``We are advising people to do their homework,'' said Sara E.
Melendez, president of Independent Sector, a Washington-based
coalition of nonprofit organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually anyone can set up a Web site to shill for a cause,
bona fide or bogus. ``You can imagine that someone could come up
with a Web site that tugs at your heartstrings and purports to do
all kinds of charitable things but that only exists in the mind of
the Web site designer,'' said Karl Emerson, director of
Pennsylvania's Bureau of Charitable Organizations and president of
the National Association of State Charity Officials.
</P>
<P>
   There are no rules governing charity on line, he said, and so
far, Internet fund-raisers are not required to register with state
officials, a requirement for telemarketers and direct mail
solicitors. At its recent annual meeting, Emerson's association
drafted a policy for regulating charity on line, but it will be
months before any final guidelines are issued.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, it's anything goes on line, particularly at the
shop-for-a-cause sites, which vary dramatically. Some of the sites
pocket as much as 50 percent of the commissions from sales
generated on their sites, and others enable customers to donate to
such questionable ``charities'' as The Broken Nose Fund, a Maine
man's personal plastic surgery cause.
</P>
<P>
   And it's hard to tell the difference between the on-line
ventures. AOL's helping.org is a nonprofit organization that
channels 100 percent of its donations to charity. But other similar
sites are for-profit ventures; some commercial operations make
their money through advertising and e-commerce, but others pocket a
percentage of each donation. Givenation will collect a modest fixed
fee, ranging from $2.50 to $5 per donation. But some sites keep
much more, which worries some in the nonprofit community.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is possible to fund-raise efficiently and effectively
and make a profit, well, that's the good old American way,'' said
Melendez. ``But if the profit starts to eat away at what I would
like to see going to the charity, then we need to take a second
look and monitor it closely.''
</P>
<P>
   The market is ripe for both idealists and opportunists; while
some sites are clearly profit-driven, others like helping.org and
givenation.com aspire to harness the power of the Internet to
effect sweeping social change. Yet, the most high-profile attempt
to encourage social activism on line failed dramatically last year.
NetAid (netaid.net), a joint effort of the United Nations
Development Program and Cisco Systems, was announced with great
fanfare as a portal to promote social activism and fight extreme
poverty. The Web site's debut was heralded by President Clinton and
South African President Nelson Mandela, and the site was feted with
three star-studded concerts. Despite all the hoopla, the concerts
raised only $12 million, relatively small compared with other
high-profile concert benefits. More important, the site has failed
to reach its stated goal of attracting a committed community of
volunteers and activists.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the philanthropy sector, a field traditionally slow to
change, are betting that the Internet will transform their business
irrevocably. But with Internet ventures, there are no guarantees.
``The jury is still out, and we'll have a lot more information next
Christmas,'' said Schmidt. ``At that point we'll have a better
indication of whether this is about fulfilling the incredible
promise or about the short, happy life of philanthropy on line.''

<HEADLINE>
BRADLEY CAMPAIGN SEEKS GREATER SUPPORT FROM WOMEN VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ What do women want? Bill Bradley wants to
know.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for the Democratic nomination for president, Bradley
lags behind Vice President Al Gore among women voters in New
Hampshire, Iowa, and nationally by as many as 15 percentage points,
according to numerous polls. And while Gore similarly trails among
men, women make up the larger percentage of all voters, and women
are more likely to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just means that winning the women's vote is going to give
you a tremendous advantage,'' said Elizabeth A. Sherman, director
of the Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy at the
University of Massachusetts at Boston.
</P>
<P>
   That may explain why the Bradley campaign assembled an all-women
focus group in Londonderry to test out television commercials and
themes. It is the reason why Bradley's ads are running during Oprah
Winfrey's, Rosie O'Donnell's, and Regis and Kathy Lee's shows, all
popular among women viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Anne Mueller, the former deputy corporation counsel for the
city of Nashua, was paid $60 to give her opinion on the issues and
ads assembled by Bradley's advisers for the focus group. She and
many of the other women there said they did not like the former
senator's biographical TV spot, which included a Pennsylvania
mother named Maureen Drumm, who thanked Bradley for saving her
daughter's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were all these questions and we didn't understand. What
was the point of putting her in it?'' Mueller asked. ``How did he
save her baby's life?''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as a result, the ad, which also featured Senators Daniel
Patrick Moynihan of New York and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, aired for
less than a week before being pulled. In its place came a 60-second
spot, solely featuring Drumm talking about Bradley's effort to get
insurance companies to allow mothers to stay in hospitals for 48
hours after giving birth. In a partial answer to Mueller's
question, Drumm said in the second version that she would never
have had a third child if that law had not been passed.
</P>
<P>
   Subject matter, such as hospital care for new mothers, is key to
understanding the gender gap. Experts say women are not so much
driven by ``women's issues,'' such as abortion, as they are by
left-leaning opinions on social policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women have more liberal policy preferences,'' said Anna
Greenberg, a Kennedy School of Government professor who specializes
in public opinion, gender, and politics. ``They are more liberal on
health care, education, welfare, help for the disadvantaged . . .
and gun control. Women tend to feel more economically insecure than
men and less likely to say the economy is doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is a Democratic duel over health and education that
is being played out over the airwaves. Both Bradley and Gore have
run television ads that tout their health care plans. And Gore has
sought to prevent Bradley from improving his standing among women
by continually attacking his health proposal for ``destroying''
Medicaid, undermining Medicare, and hurting African-Americans,
Latinos, women, and the disabled, as well as people with the AIDS
virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a candidate stand up and say, `I'm going to do away
with Medicaid' is extremely frightening,'' Sherman said. ``Gore is
making hay with it and Bradley's not denying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has proposed replacing Medicaid with subsidies for
people to purchase private health insurance. But Gore has lambasted
that approach as grossly inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   In another bid to appeal to women, Bradley held a news
conference recently with a group of abortion-rights activists who
endorsed his candidacy. Bradley backers have also encouraged people
to look at Gore's early congressional voting record before he had
embraced a woman's right to an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, Bradley polls extremely well among men. In
general, these men are well-educated, older, and earning a sizable
income. Mark Longabaugh, Bradley's New Hampshire campaign director,
said male voters have followed Bradley's career for years, first
watching him as a basketball player for the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``As women get to know Bill, they'll find him a very, very good
spokesman for their concerns,'' Longabaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   Some, however, see Bradley highlighting his basketball career as
an annoyance to women voters. A video shown at the Florida
Democratic convention in December made liberal use of photographs
showing Bradley on the court. And a major fund-raiser at Madison
Square Garden featured a multitude of his teammates from the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just isn't a way to appeal to women,'' said Susan Carroll,
a senior research associate at the Center for American Women and
Politics at Rutgers University. ``Women look at it and say, `It's
just not relevant.' ''
</P>
<P>
   According to numbers from the US Census, the opinions of women
voters literally count for more than men's.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 67 percent of all women eligible to vote registered,
compared with 64 percent of all men. Of those registered to vote,
55 percent of women cast a ballot, compared with 53 percent of men.
In real numbers, 5 million more women than men voted in the 1996
general election.
</P>
<P>
   But Longabaugh said Bradley is poised to run well in the general
election because women are more likely to vote Democratic and men
are more likely to vote Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley runs better against any Republican than Gore,''
Longabaugh said. ``He's much stronger among men.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent Globe/WBZ-TV poll demonstrates Bradley's strength among
men compared with Gore's strength among women. While the pair each
pulled 44 percent of those surveyed, Bradley's support was made up
of 49 percent men and 40 percent women. Gore's support, by
contrast, consisted of 40 percent men and 47 percent women.
</P>
<P>
   But before Bradley can take on a Republican, he has to win the
Democratic nomination. And Mueller, for one, has questions about
his commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem I have is that he resigned from the Senate,'' said
Mueller, a Democrat. ``You want someone who cares about women's
issues and will fight for women's issues. I don't wan't someone who
will resign.''

   &UR;  &LR; MONROE, Iowa _ The first of the presidential primary contests
is almost here, yet the public's interest is as
uncharacteristically mild as the weather in Iowa and New Hampshire
has been this winter. Interest is even milder in the rest of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are only vaguely aware of the campaigning,
maneuvering, debating, jousting, and muscling for advantage in
Iowa's Jan. 24 caucuses and New Hampshire's Feb. 1 primary,
according to the weekly measurements by Harvard's Vanishing Voter
Project. Last week's soundings found that only one American in nine
paid much attention to the political proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   There are, to be sure, pockets of passion in political America,
and, not surprisingly, most of them are in Iowa and New Hampshire,
which, with few metropolitan areas and few minority citizens, are
unlike the rest of the country in many other ways. Here campaign
advertisements clog the airwaves; candidates are turning up at
schools, community centers, and workplaces; and organizers are
scouring the countryside for supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in New Hampshire, the most recent poll taken by The
Boston Globe and WBZ found that 910 of likely voters have been
paying a lot or some attention to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But despite a blip last week in interest _ the Harvard poll
showed that the slice of Americans who could recall any news story
about the campaign doubled in the past week, from 19 percent to 39
percent, probably because of debate coverage _ much of the country
seems to be snoozing when it comes to politics.
</P>
<P>
   And if they are paying any attention at all, they certainly are
not talking about it; the Harvard poll shows that 85 percent of
Americans say they hadn't discussed the campaign with anyone. So
far this year there is more zzzz than buzz to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a new period of normalcy around our election politics
where people just don't get engaged or excited the way they used
to,'' said Thomas Patterson, who directs the Harvard project.
``People now feel disconnected enough from politics that it's
actually hard for them to engage.''
</P>
<P>
   But why?
</P>
<P>
   One reason surely is the early start to the campaign; many
Americans wonder why they should focus on politics in January when
the general election isn't until November. ``In places where there
are upcoming primaries and caucuses, people have a sense of
immediacy. But most of the rest of the country knows that the
election is far away,'' said Gregory Flemming, survey director for
the Pew Research Center, which conducts nationwide polls.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also no deep strain of discontent in the country.
With the stock market soaring and unemployment low, there is little
economic distress, and with no big-power confrontation on the
horizon, there are few national-security worries. And though
opinion polls show public impatience with politicians and with the
political system, they also show general public satisfaction with
the direction of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of Americans who say they are satisfied with the
way things are going in the United States right now, according to a
new Gallup Organization survey for USA Today and CNN, is an
astonishing 69 percent _ well more than double the 29 percent that
expressed satisfaction seven years ago this month.
</P>
<P>
   What especially worries political scientists and politicians is
the degree to which younger people remain uninvolved and
uninterested in the political system. The young people interviewed
in both parties for the Globe/WBZ poll showed that 18- to
39-year-olds in New Hampshire were by far the least attentive to
the campaign in that state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about young people who believe politics in
Washington is controlled by money and that they don't have a
voice,'' former senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, a Democratic
presidential candidate, said in an interview this week. ``The level
of cynicism about money and politics has never been higher.''
</P>
<P>
   In many of the weeks studied in the Harvard poll, less than 10
percent of young people nationwide said they were paying any
attention at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the habits we develop for the rest of our lives are
developed when people are young, and if people don't get the civic
habit when they are young they may not get it at all,'' said
Patterson. ``We may be creating a generation where political
interest is so low that it is a very minor part of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, active engagement
is limited to a hard core of voters who function as political
insiders _ the dwindling bands of Americans who follow politics the
way others follow sports, with great attention to the standings of
the competitors and to the details that fascinate the aficionados _
details like batters' performances with runners in scoring
position, or candidates' proposals for eliminating the tax credit
for electricity produced from poultry waste.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the people the candidates' organizers are hoping to
shepherd to the polls in New Hampshire or to far-flung caucus
locations in Iowa, where participating in the first tests of the
presidential election year requires far more commitment than simply
flipping a lever in a polling station. In Poweshiek County in
central Iowa, for example, organizers are struggling to figure out
how to get a handful of their supporters to caucuses in places like
Ellie's Soda Fountain in Montezuma, Beverly and Dan Malloy's home
in Lake Ponderosa, and the community center in Hartwick.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one cares about this or pays any attention to all this
stuff except for the insiders,'' says Barbara Trish, a Grinnell
College political scientist who studies public participation in
politics, especially in Iowa. ``But the insiders really do care.
They live and breathe it at this time in the season. It's a core
that's scrambling to get people to caucus sites or that is thinking
strategy all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Among that group, events like Saturday's Republican debate in
Des Moines are important. An Iowa Poll taken this month showed that
two-thirds of likely Democratic caucus-goers have watched at least
some of the debates so far in the campaign. ``Those people pay
attention,'' says David Hudson, who was the Iowa state director for
the now-defunct GOP campaign of former vice president Dan Quayle.
``We know we're first. We know we're making a big decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But those are the insiders. ``Some of the others _ people who
read a newspaper daily, identify with a party but are not
passionate about it _ are also tuned in,'' said Hugh Winebrenner, a
Drake University political scientist who is the dean of Iowa's
caucus experts. ``But even here it's an insiders' game, and the
insiders are paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parties' goal is to attract 100,000 people to the precinct
caucuses Jan. 24. But the chances of doing so are slim, in part
because none of the candidates is generating much excitement. The
contender with the strongest position in the state, Governor George
W. Bush of Texas, has such a robust lead in the GOP contest here
that his supporters have less incentive to turn up at a caucus
location on a Monday night in January than they might if their
candidate were facing a difficult challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes, a Republican presidential candidate, said the
public's lack of interest in politics indicates troubling attitudes
that pervade American society. ``There is a malaise in our
country,'' Keyes said in an interview at the Monroe Prairie City
High School here, ``that is a symptom of our moral crisis.''

before anyone gets to vote, according to two prominent Republican
dropouts. Lamar Alexander and Dan Quayle, while praising
front-running Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, contended in separate

states to hold early primaries, is a major factor in the declining
voting rates: just 49 percent of adults voted in 1996. By Adam

GORE PUSHES TO MAXIMIZE AN IOWA WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SLOAN, Iowa _ He offered to help a farmer having problems with
his ram. He repeated, word for word, one man's advice on how to
reassure voters who were concerned about scandal. And he promised a
person who had undergone surgery to become a woman that he would
learn about transgender issues.
</P>
<P>
   During a three-day visit to the first-in-the-nation caucus
state, Vice President Al Gore is trying to seal the deal, making
pledges all the way from Davenport to Sioux City, looking for a big
win eight days from now. Even his opponent, Bill Bradley, expects
Gore to prevail here Jan. 24, but the question is how wide the win,
how big the push will be going into New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   And here is how Gore is putting the finishing touches to the
Hawkeye State: Staying positive, staying away from pesky national
reporters, and allowing others to do the dirty work.
</P>
<P>
   Down a gravel road, past fallow corn and soybean fields, Gore
visited with several hundred voters in Jon Roarson's frigid barn.
The vice president brought along Senator Tom Harkin, an Iowa
Democrat featured in a television commercial for Gore, and a New
Jersey farmer named Roy Etsch.
</P>
<P>
   Gore talked fluently about agricultural trade policy,
countercyclical crop payments, and the reason the bottom has fallen
out of the hog market. He left it to Harkin and Etsch to come in
for the kill.
</P>
<P>
   On crop insurance, ethanol, price supports, and flood relief,
Bradley voted against family farmers, Harkin said. The vice
president, he said, stood with the farmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you these things because I think you ought to know
it,'' Harkin said, comparing the information to a homebuyer finding
cracks in the foundation of a house.
</P>
<P>
   Etsch, an older man whose hearing has declined, delivered the
coup de grace. He said Bradley never cared about farmers, even
though New Jersey is home to 9,000 family farms. He said Bradley
was unavailable to meet with farmers when he served in the Senate,
and told of the time he once finagled an appointment, only to
arrive in Washington to be stood up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt even today he knows the difference between corn and
soybean,'' Etsch said. Though he said he is not looking to cause
trouble, and he always voted for Bradley in Senate races, Etsch
said he was certain what would happen if Bradley became president:
``He'd forget about the agriculture community completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Caucuses are not like primaries, where people vote and leave.
Instead, Iowans gather together in homes, schools and churches,
debating the virtues and flaws of the candidates for hours on end
before a vote is taken. It takes time and commitment to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   It also takes organization. And that is why Gore has visited
with activists and labor leaders in meetings large and small,
simultaneously imploring, thanking, and energizing his troops.
</P>
<P>
   One stop was at the United Auto Workers local in Waterloo. In a
squat, tan building by the highway, Gore thanked the members for
their early endorsement of his candidacy over Bradley last year,
despite resistance by their national leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget it _ ever,'' he said, reminding them that he
supports a $1-an-hour increase in the minimum wage, a strengthened
National Labor Relations Board, and strong antitrust enforcement on
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   And he begged the crowd not just to vote, but to bring their
families, friends, and neighbors, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what you can do. You know what you can do,'' Gore said.
``I need your help and I need it now _ 12 days, two hours, and
seven and a half minutes are left until the caucuses begin. I need
you and I'm counting on you.''
</P>
<P>
   In between his meetings with the voters, Gore steered clear of
the busload of reporters trailing behind and tried to avoid gaffes.
Answering questions from Iowans is the preferred technique, as Gore
likes to say.
</P>
<P>
   In Cedar Rapids, for example, Gore stood under hot stage lights
at Coe Community College's theater in the round, promising to take
every question, no matter how long it took. He stayed for more than
three hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going anywhere,'' he declared. ``I'm staying right
here. If necessary, I'll stand here till 7 p.m. on the evening of
the 24th.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Wilson, a farmer with a gift for metaphors, told Gore about
the problem he's been having with his 300-pound ram, which, he
informed the vice president, is a male sheep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since I put him in with the ewes, the female sheeps, he
has taken the position that I am not allowed to go into the pen,''
Wilson said. ``Every time I step into the pen, he will charge into
me and ram into me over and over until I leave the pen.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he hadn't yet made his point _ that he's feeling battered
by federal farm policy _ Gore was itching to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well you know, as eager as I am to win the support of caucus
goers, I promise you I will try to help you with this,'' he said,
laughing at the absurdity.
</P>
<P>
   More seriously, an older man described himself as a fan of the
Clinton administration's accomplishments, yet still unsure how to
vote in the Democratic contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned that your ability to win the election is reduced
by your association with the Clinton scandal,'' he said, referring
to the president's affair with an intern. ``I think you have to
come up with some way to make a statement that says you're
separated somehow in order for you to be elected. And I have a
suggestion for that statement, which is something along the lines
of, `I wouldn't have done that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Without hesitation, Gore replied: ``I wouldn't have done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not every voter received a ready answer, or even a
lengthy one. When a heavy-set woman with broad shoulders and
scraggly blonde hair asked Gore if he would cover transgender
people in the employment nondiscrimination act, he was slightly
flummoxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will have to educate myself on that,'' he promised.

LIMERICK RISES FROM THE `ASHES' 
</HEADLINE>

 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   LIMERICK, Ireland _ Finally, there is something that everyone
here agrees on about ``Angela's Ashes'': It rains too much in the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, if it rained as much in Limerick as it did in that film
poor Frankie McCourt would have drowned and never wrote his book,''
said Harry Leahy, 75, a retired doctor, after watching the movie at
the Savoy, a stone's throw from the scenes of ``Angela's Ashes.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank McCourt's bittersweet memoir of growing up poor won the
Pulitzer Prize, has sold more than 6 million copies, and has been
translated into 25 languages. Its story of crushing poverty and
human resilience has touched hearts across the world.
</P>
<P>
   But in Limerick, the squalor and cruelty that McCourt so vividly
described touched a raw nerve. There remains a small but persistent
minority who accuse McCourt of exaggerating his family's suffering
and the humiliation they endured at the hands of Limerick's elite,
especially the Roman Catholic clergy and laity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the vast majority in this city of 100,000 seem to accept
McCourt's harsh account of life in the lanes of Limerick in the
1930s and 1940s. Rather than debate whether the Redemptorist
priests and the teachers at Leamy School were as mean as McCourt
recalls them, most people here seem determined to capitalize on
Limerick's newfound status as a place known by tens of millions of
people throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Limerick's name recognition will only grow with the release of
Alan Parker's film adaptation of ``Angela's Ashes,'' which opened
here Friday and opens across the United States this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect more people will see the film than read the book,''
said John Leonard, tourism development manager for Shannon
Development Co. ``We want to be ready for the people who will come
here after seeing the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Limerick's efforts to exploit the success of ``Angela's Ashes''
are in their nascent stages. The only tangible sign is a walking
tour of sites mentioned in the book, organized by a local community
group. Leonard and other business leaders say Limerick has
benefited from ``Angela's Ashes'' by attracting thousands of
curious tourists who otherwise would not come here.
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 miles from Shannon Airport, Limerick used to be an
industrial port on the Shannon River which tourists passed through
on their way to the lush countryside of Kerry or West Cork. But
those who have read ``Angela's Ashes,'' and even some who are just
vaguely aware of its wide acclaim, have traveled here in the last
few years, seeking out the lanes where McCourt's twin brothers
died, his father walked in a fruitless search for work, and his
mother persevered despite overwhelming grief and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, there is little left of the dark, dank Limerick
that tortured Frank McCourt. None of the squalid tenements where
the McCourts lived still stand. Leamy School is now Leamy House, a
business center. South's pub, where McCourt's father squandered the
food money and where McCourt had his first pint in a rite of
passage fondly recalled in the book and film, is still there. But
these days, the pub is full of suits who work at the Dell Computer
plant, not blackened-faced workers from Suttons coal yard, which
has since closed.
</P>
<P>
   The firm grip that the fire-and-brimstone Redemptorists had on
much of the local population has greatly diminished, a point
underscored by the Utopia Sex Shop on Ellen Street.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said the three churches here that were featured in
McCourt's story refused him permission to film. Brendan Halligan,
editor of the Limerick Leader, disputes that, saying that one
church offered to move a wedding back an hour to accommodate the
filmmakers ``but that wasn't good enough for Mr. Parker and his
crew.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people in Limerick like to point out that Parker was forced
to go to Cork and Dublin to film scenes of squalor that no longer
exist here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I get someone from Cork in my taxi, I remind them of
that,'' cabbie Pat O'Connor said with glee.
</P>
<P>
   At the film's premiere here Wednesday night, Limerick's Mayor
Jack Bourke praised the movie, but suggested it should not have
been shot here at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film should not have been made in Limerick as we do not
have such derelict hovels,'' said Bourke. ``They could only use
certain parts of Limerick and go to Dublin and Cork to shoot the
hovels and lanes as we don't have that in Limerick anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   That Bourke had to raise a fuss to get a premiere staged here at
all fed a well-honed inferiority complex that many McCourt critics
harbor. Originally, the film was going to be premiered in Dublin.
After Bourke complained, the film's distributors belatedly agreed
to simultaneous premieres in Dublin and Limerick.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of Ireland, which is second only to the United
States in world software production, Limerick has boomed over the
last 10 years, progress quite unrelated to ``Angela's Ashes.''
Still, Limerick suffers from an image problem that is also
unrelated to the place so richly captured by McCourt. In the 1980s,
an Irish comic dubbed it ``Stab City,'' a catchy putdown that
remains especially popular with Dubliners, even though the Irish
capital has more crime per capita than Limerick.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Gleeson, research executive for the Limerick Chamber of
Commerce, spent three years studying the city's image and concluded
that most Irish people have a negative perception of Limerick. She
said interviews with tourists revealed that their negative view of
the city was almost always introduced or reinforced by
conversations with Irish people.
</P>
<P>
   McCourt's critics blame him for perpetuating that negative
image, but Gleeson said her research did not reveal that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think `Angela's Ashes' can do nothing but good for
Limerick,'' said Gleeson, 28. ``It put us on the map. And my
research showed that a lot of what Frank McCourt said was true.
Limerick was more fervently religious than other cities back then.
The poverty was bad. Even my dad went to school without shoes. Some
people are embarrassed by that, but that's the way it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Gleeson is among those who believe the city has been slow to
capitalize on the interest in `` Angela's Ashes.'' A $3.5 million
public-private project to boost the city's image called Limerick
2005 aims at changing that.
</P>
<P>
   There is talk of creating an Angela's Ashes Trail, but so far
the only tourist attraction is a walking tour organized by the St.
Mary's Development Program, a community group that uses the $6 fee
to help the poor and elderly of the city's oldest parish. John
O'Regan, 38, the group's liaison officer, said that about 800
people from all over the world have taken the tour since it was
created in 1997, but he hopes the numbers will rise dramatically
this year because of the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tour takes people to the places that Frank McCourt
described in the book, but it also shows them the Limerick of
today,'' said O'Regan.
</P>
<P>
   The tour's altruistic roots did little to appease the likes of
Paddy Malone, who called the tour organizers and accused them of
being ``a front for Frank McCourt.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone, a classmate of McCourt's, disputes McCourt's
recollections and complains that he wrote about people without
their permission. In 1997, Malone stood before McCourt during a
book-signing at O'Mahoney's bookshop here and tore up a copy of
``Angela's Ashes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Malone and the other begrudgers were nowhere to be seen a
few months ago when McCourt returned to sign copies of the sequel,
`` 'Tis.'' David O'Mahoney said he and his brother, Frank, put on
extra security at their bookshop, but a feared protest never
materialized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a tendency to pay too much attention to the
begrudgers,'' said David O'Mahoney. ``The vast majority of people
in Limerick loved the book and will love the film.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Mahoney's, Limerick's biggest bookshop, has sold more than
6,000 copies of ``Angela's Ashes,'' about 10 times more than any
previous bestseller, and 1,200 copies of `` 'Tis.'' In contrast,
two books written by Gerry Hannan, a radio show host who is
McCourt's fiercest and some say most opportunist critic, have found
a distinctly minority audience. O'Mahoney said Hannan's ``Ashes,''
which views Limerick through more rose-colored glasses, has sold
500 copies, while Hannan's own sequel, `` 'Tis in Me Ass,'' has
sold just over 100.
</P>
<P>
   Like Frank McCourt, most of Limerick has moved on, even
physically. For centuries, the city's buildings turned their backs
on the Shannon, the river whose damp brought misery to impoverished
families like the McCourts. Now, the city has been largely rebuilt
to face the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turning around to face the Shannon has opened new vistas for
Limerick,'' said Gleeson.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the film, meanwhile, has created a new dilemma
for the begrudgers, who can't decide what bothers them more, that
``Angela's Ashes'' was written by an American, or filmed by an
Englishman.

ELDERLY HIT HARDEST BY OUTDATED PRACTICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frances White recently received a letter from AT&AMP;T, warning that
she had a past-due account that was about to be turned over to a
collection agency.
</P>
<P>
   White, 82, alarmed by the threatening tone of the letter, called
her son, Kevin O'Connor. O'Connor looked at the letter and made a
shocking discovery.
</P>
<P>
   He learned that his mother had been leasing since 1984 a black,
rotary-dial phone manufactured in 1962. For what she was paying on
the lease, nearly $55 a year, she could have bought five phones and
have money left over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unbelievable,'' said O'Connor, of Boston. ``Her phone
belongs in a museum.''
</P>
<P>
   What's even more amazing is that White is not alone. Sixteen
years after the breakup of AT&AMP;T Corp., approximately 3 million
Americans, a disproportionate number of them elderly, are still
leasing 3.5 million phones at rates that make no sense, given the
price of phones today.
</P>
<P>
   Lease rates range from a low of $4.45 a month for a basic corded
phone to $21 a month for a full-feature, two-line cordless phone
with an answering machine. Staples carries a corded General
Electric phone for $9.99 or a cordless 900 megahertz VTech phone
for $29.98.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said he wanted others to make sure their parents were
not victims of phone leasing. He described his mother as forgetful,
which may explain why she missed a lease payment on her phone. But
he said the reason she leased her phone all those years was
probably out of habit.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother gets a bill in the mail from a company like AT&AMP;T and
she just pays it,'' he said. ``I don't think she knew she was
leasing a phone until she got this letter.''
</P>
<P>
   After O'Connor expressed his anger to AT&AMP;T Consumer Leasing
Services, the company canceled his mother's lease, forgave the
past-due amount, and let her keep her old phone without paying a
$9.35 ``recovery charge.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Consumer Leasing is owned by Lucent Technologies of Murray
Hill, N.J., a company spun off from AT&AMP;T in 1997. Lucent licenses
the AT&AMP;T name for its leasing business.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lucent spokesman John Skalko, the 3 million
customers who lease phones ``tend to be somewhat more senior.''
While he declined to discuss whether leasing a phone made economic
sense, he said the company is not taking advantage of the elderly.
He said the lease arrangements are spelled out in the bills
customers receive. Those bills have been separate from customer
phone bills since Lucent was spun off from AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an individual customer's choice,'' Skalko said. ``As long
as there is demand for the service, we will continue to provide
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Baker, a senior adviser at the public policy institute of
the American Association of Retired Persons in Washington, was
critical of Lucent for not doing more to stop phone leasing. He
said AARP tries to educate members about the high cost of leasing,
but each year, he said, the organization gets a handful of letters
from people who have discovered their parents had been leasing
their phones for years.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said the Federal Trade Commission used to put out booklets
on the disadvantages of phone leasing, but he said the agency has
moved on to other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys conducted by the AARP indicate that people over 65 are
more likely to lease their phones, a practice Baker called
``ridiculous.'' Only 2 percent of those under 65 lease their phone,
but the percentage rises to 4 percent for people between 65 and 75
and to 6 percent for those over 75.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these people have had AT&AMP;T for their whole life,'' he
said. ``They get a bill and they pay it.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, AARP surveys indicate 75 percent of people over 65
continue to pay the most expensive basic long-distance phone rates
rather than switch to a discount plan. ``It's basically
confusion,'' Baker said. ``They see all the ads and the fine print
and they don't want to deal with that, so they stand pat.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, when AT&AMP;T was forced to divest its local phone
operations, consumers initially were given three options: buy their
AT&AMP;T phone equipment; lease it; or return it and buy a phone from
another company. After that initial period, customers could only
lease their AT&AMP;T phone or return it and buy a phone from someone
else.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans quickly discovered the economic advantages of
owning their phones. But White kept paying the lease as she always
had. ``I never had any problem with it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Skalko said White could have traded in the black rotary-dial
phone for a newer model at any time, although, he said, her monthly
charge might have increased slightly.
</P>
<P>
   But White never asked for a new phone. O'Connor bought her two
new phones over the years, but each time she found a problem with
the new phone and asked for her old black rotary-dial phone back.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said that if he had known his mother was leasing her
phone, he would have insisted she get rid of it. But he never knew
until he read the letter from AT&AMP;T. His mother continues to use her
black rotary-dial phone, but now realizes she was taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I paid all those years for nothing,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Frances White recently received a letter from AT&AMP;T, warning that
she had a past-due account that was about to be turned over to a
collection agency.
</P>
<P>
   White, 82, alarmed by the threatening tone of the letter, called
her son, Kevin O'Connor. O'Connor looked at the letter and made a
shocking discovery.
</P>
<P>
   He learned that his mother had been leasing since 1984 a black,
rotary-dial phone manufactured in 1962. For what she was paying on
the lease, nearly $55 a year, she could have bought five phones and
have money left over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unbelievable,'' said O'Connor, of Boston. ``Her phone
belongs in a museum.''
</P>
<P>
   What's even more amazing is that White is not alone. Sixteen
years after the breakup of AT&AMP;T Corp., approximately 3 million
Americans, a disproportionate number of them elderly, are still
leasing 3.5 million phones at rates that make no sense, given the
price of phones today.
</P>
<P>
   Lease rates range from a low of $4.45 a month for a basic corded
phone to $21 a month for a full-feature, two-line cordless phone
with an answering machine. Staples carries a corded General
Electric phone for $9.99 or a cordless 900 megahertz VTech phone
for $29.98.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said he wanted others to make sure their parents were
not victims of phone leasing. He described his mother as forgetful,
which may explain why she missed a lease payment on her phone. But
he said the reason she leased her phone all those years was
probably out of habit.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother gets a bill in the mail from a company like AT&AMP;T and
she just pays it,'' he said. ``I don't think she knew she was
leasing a phone until she got this letter.''
</P>
<P>
   After O'Connor expressed his anger to AT&AMP;T Consumer Leasing
Services, the company canceled his mother's lease, forgave the
past-due amount, and let her keep her old phone without paying a
$9.35 ``recovery charge.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Consumer Leasing is owned by Lucent Technologies of Murray
Hill, N.J., a company spun off from AT&AMP;T in 1997. Lucent licenses
the AT&AMP;T name for its leasing business.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lucent spokesman John Skalko, the 3 million
customers who lease phones ``tend to be somewhat more senior.''
While he declined to discuss whether leasing a phone made economic
sense, he said the company is not taking advantage of the elderly.
He said the lease arrangements are spelled out in the bills
customers receive. Those bills have been separate from customer
phone bills since Lucent was spun off from AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an individual customer's choice,'' Skalko said. ``As long
as there is demand for the service, we will continue to provide
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Baker, a senior adviser at the public policy institute of
the American Association of Retired Persons in Washington, was
critical of Lucent for not doing more to stop phone leasing. He
said AARP tries to educate members about the high cost of leasing,
but each year, he said, the organization gets a handful of letters
from people who have discovered their parents had been leasing
their phones for years.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said the Federal Trade Commission used to put out booklets
on the disadvantages of phone leasing, but he said the agency has
moved on to other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys conducted by the AARP indicate that people over 65 are
more likely to lease their phones, a practice Baker called
``ridiculous.'' Only 2 percent of those under 65 lease their phone,
but the percentage rises to 4 percent for people between 65 and 75
and to 6 percent for those over 75.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these people have had AT&AMP;T for their whole life,'' he
said. ``They get a bill and they pay it.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, AARP surveys indicate 75 percent of people over 65
continue to pay the most expensive basic long-distance phone rates
rather than switch to a discount plan. ``It's basically
confusion,'' Baker said. ``They see all the ads and the fine print
and they don't want to deal with that, so they stand pat.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, when AT&AMP;T was forced to divest its local phone
operations, consumers initially were given three options: buy their
AT&AMP;T phone equipment; lease it; or return it and buy a phone from
another company. After that initial period, customers could only
lease their AT&AMP;T phone or return it and buy a phone from someone
else.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans quickly discovered the economic advantages of
owning their phones. But White kept paying the lease as she always
had. ``I never had any problem with it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Skalko said White could have traded in the black rotary-dial
phone for a newer model at any time, although, he said, her monthly
charge might have increased slightly.
</P>
<P>
   But White never asked for a new phone. O'Connor bought her two
new phones over the years, but each time she found a problem with
the new phone and asked for her old black rotary-dial phone back.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said that if he had known his mother was leasing her
phone, he would have insisted she get rid of it. But he never knew
until he read the letter from AT&AMP;T. His mother continues to use her
black rotary-dial phone, but now realizes she was taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I paid all those years for nothing,'' she said.

BERNSTEIN'S UNSUNG SHOWS GET THEIR DUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leonard Bernstein's ``West Side Story'' became an American
classic on its opening night in 1957. Recognition for ``Candide''
came more slowly. The show opened on Broadway in 1956. It became a
cult favorite, but didn't begin to reveal its full stature until
revivals in the late 1970s, and it wasn't really until 1989, the
year before Bernstein's death, that the work achieved the musical
shape the composer had envisioned from the beginning. Over the last
decade ``Candide'' has entered the regular repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of Bernstein's first two Broadway shows, ``On the Town''
and ``Wonderful Town'' was as ambitious or as fabulously successful
as ``West Side Story.'' Still, both of them ran longer than the
original production of ``Candide'' did, although neither has built
anything like a comparable post-Broadway life. The similarity of
their titles may have worked against the shows, and the books and
lyrics have become dated, with songs in both shows that now require
footnotes. Also there are no megahits in either score; Bernstein, a
bit defensively, said he didn't intend to write independent hits _
instead he wanted the songs to grow out of character and situation,
as in an opera. A few songs such as ``Lonely Town,'' ``Lucky to Be
Me,'' ``A Little Bit in Love,'' and the politically incorrect ``A
Quiet Girl'' inspire affection and have enjoyed modest but
permanent success.
</P>
<P>
   Today these shows stand as an undervalued part of Bernstein's
compositional legacy _ the books may have dated, but Bernstein's
music still seems perpetually fresh, and more likely to endure than
some of his more ambitious, not to say portentous, works.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Simon Rattle's new recording of ``Wonderful Town'' features
a prestigious cast headed by Audra McDonald and Thomas Hampson, and
appears on an international label, EMI. It is abundantly good
enough to redirect attention to this delightful score and maybe
even lead to new attempts to keep it stageworthy. Unexpectedly,
however, the actual performance is aced by a year-old two-CD set on
a comparatively obscure British label, JAY, which has also produced
notable complete recordings of ``On the Town,'' ``West Side
Story,'' and ``Candide,'' as well as such other shows as ``Pajama
Game'' and ``Cabaret.''
</P>
<P>
   The origins of the piece lay in a series of comic sketches
Ohio-born Ruth McKenney wrote about her first years in New York in
the 1930s with her younger sister, the captivating Eileen. (In a
bizarre footnote, the real-life Eileen married the novelist
Nathaniel West and died with him in an auto accident in 1940.)
McKenney's sketches had been collected into a best-selling book,
``My Sister Eileen,'' transformed into a hit play, and then into a
popular movie that starred Rosalind Russell as an incomparably wry
Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, Russell, was under option for a musical version in
which she would re-create her film role of a decade before. A first
attempt at a score, by Leroy Anderson, with lyrics by Arnold B.
Howitt, did not win the star's favor. Bernstein came into the
project because his friends Betty Comden and Adolph Green had
recently come on board as rescue lyricists. They weren't sure he
would be interested; he had promised his mentor, Serge
Koussevitzky, music director of the Boston Symphony, that he
wouldn't write for Broadway anymore and would instead concentrate
on additional ``important'' orchestral works such as the
``Jeremiah'' Symphony. But when Comden and Green mentioned the '30s
setting, Bernstein was off and running; he cried out ``Eddie
Duchin!'' and headed straight for the piano.
</P>
<P>
   Russell's option had only weeks to run, so the collaborators
wrote their part of the show in little more than a month. Of
course, they were used to working together. Along with Judith
Tuvim, who later became Judy Holliday, they had appeared as a
musical-satire act called ``The Revuers,'' and, of course, they had
collaborated on ``On the Town.''
</P>
<P>
   The show tried out in New Haven and then, a week later, opened
at the Colonial Theater in Boston in January 1953; Jerome Robbins
came on board at the Colonial to work on the choreography,
reportedly because a male dancer had dropped Russell during a
number. After ``Wonderful Town'' hit New York at the end of
February, it ran for 559 performances _ after Russell left the
show, even the firepower of her successor, Carol Channing, was not
enough to keep it going for more than three additional months. In
1955, there was a ``Wonderful Town'' film with Betty Garrett and
Janet Leigh as the sisters, but it featured new songs not by
Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, Russell, then 50, reprised one last time for a
television ``spectacular'' the wisecracking role she had first
played in 16 years before. The original Broadway cast recording of
``Wonderful Town'' was on Decca; it briefly appeared on CD, but it
is not currently available. The TV soundtrack, on Sony, features
Jacquelyn McKeever instead of Broadway's Edie Adams as Eileen.
Russell's ripe baritone remains uniquely cherishable (according to
Humphrey Burton's Bernstein biography, Russell described her voice
to a newspaper reporter as ``so bass, it's viol''). Russell had the
advantage, and disadvantage, of a major career and star image
behind her, an image that is permanent because it remains
accessible on film. What remains on record even for those who have
never heard of her or recall her dazzling presence, is one of a
performer's most important assets _ an impeccable sense of rhythm
and timing, which are as important to an actor as they are to a
singer. Russell's rhythm is more musical than that of many
professional singers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lively and detailed annotation in the JAY set
by theater historian Jeffrey Dunn, there have been occasional
revivals of ``Wonderful Town'' since 1958, with such lively
personalities as Kaye Ballard, Elaine Stritch, Nanette Fabray, and
Lauren Bacall in the Russell role. In the '80s, there was a London
revival with new orchestrations replacing the originals, and the
New York City Opera brought the show into its repertory a few years
ago. The London revival was recorded, but the new versions are the
first important recordings of the original score in 40 years, and
the JAY version is the first-ever complete recording of the music _
in includes all the underscored dialogue, including the scene of
``Ruth's Stories,'' and, in an appendix, alternate versions of ``A
Little Bit in Love'' and ``Christopher Street.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderful Town'' boasts a wonderful score composed in the
eclectic blend of Gilbert and Sullivan, Stravinsky, Copland,
Duchin, and a host of other things that came out sounding like
Leonard Bernstein's own natural voice. There are ballads, novelty
numbers, Cole Porter list-and-rhyming songs, a Latin number
(``Conga!''), an Irish parlor ballad (``My Darlin' Eileen''), jazz
(``Swing!''), and satire (``Ballet at the Village Vortex,'' ``The
Wrong-Note Rag,'' ``Pass the Football,'' and the extraordinary
``Conversation Piece,'' which ends with a volley of soprano
coloratura that anticipates ``Glitter and Be Gay'' in ``Candide.'')
It does make a difference to hear the score complete, in the JAY
recording, because ``Wonderful Town'' is not just a ``number''
show; it is through-composed, with many internal cross-references.
</P>
<P>
   The Rattle recording has strong singers in all the roles _
Rodney Gilfrey, who sang Stanley Kowalski in Andre Previn's ``A
Streetcar Named Desire,'' takes three supporting parts. But not
everyone seems happily cast. Kim Criswell, a fixture on Broadway
revival recordings, has a terrific set of pipes, but she never does
much besides blast away with them, and as Ruth she overdoes the
Louis Armstrong rasp and growl; she has plenty of pep, but her
performance is generic. Audra McDonald has an even better voice and
she goes far deeper into her songs, but her best qualities aren't
helpful in this particular part. There's no way this infinitely
sophisticated artist can sound like an innocent ingenue from Ohio;
she lacks the ability to be spontaneous and casual. The coloratura
at the end of ``Conversation Piece'' is an a different acoustic
from the rest of the ensemble, and it sounds overdubbed. Thomas
Hampson sings resonantly but the aura of narcissism that invariably
surrounds his performances doesn't make him a very attractive hero.
The players from the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group are
terrific, and there is lots of rhythm, drive, and character in
Rattle's work, although there is an equally important element of
relaxed, loosey-goosey ``Revuers''-style improvisation, that eludes
him and his cast.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the singers in the TER-Jay version work out better than
their counterparts with Rattle. Rebecca Luker, Magnolia in the
Harold Prince revival of ``Showboat,'' is delightfully fresh as
Eileen, and she shares with Barbara Cook the ability to make
coloratura sound conversational. Her ``A Little Bit In Love'' is
simultaneously wistful and fulfilled. Karen Mason, one of
Broadway's Norma Desmonds in ``Sunset Boulevard,'' brings much more
shading to Ruth than Criswell does. And Ron Raines sounds like a
hearty Broadway leading man, not like a slumming opera star _
although this Broadway singer can produce a more ringing high note
on the word ``fish'' than Hampson can. Conductor John Owen Edwards
is a Broadway specialist and a good one; you might not want to hear
him conduct ``Parsifal'' or ``Pelleas et Melisande,'' where he
would be unlikely to compete successfully with Rattle, but he is
more idiomatic in Bernstein than Rattle is.
</P>
<P>
   These second-generation recordings of ``Wonderful Town'' ought
to play as important a role in establishing the stature of the
score as the post-original-cast recordings of ``Candide'' did. Now
only one of Bernstein's Broadway scores remains virtually unknown:
``1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,'' a 1976 flop which for Bernstein
represented the greatest professional embarrassment of his career _
few of his musical intentions made it to opening night, and the
show was never recorded. In 1977, the Bernstein estate commissioned
``A White House Cantata,'' which collects the music and arranges it
into performable form. Conductor Kent Nagano led a number of
performances in Europe, but what the piece needs to put it on the
map is a recording.

SO I AM GLAD 
By A. L. Kennedy. Knopf 
276 pp. $23. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A.L. Kennedy is a fierce and enchanting writer with a voice as
smoky as dry ice, and God save Scotland for exporting her fiction
to America. A Glaswegian born in Dundee in 1965, she's both
joyously irreverent and surprisingly wise; she will write
unflinchingly about pornography, religious mysteries, and domestic
abuse in the same long breath, managing to link those discrete
territories by their commonalities of power and longing. Her
characters are modern versions of the Southern grotesques of Carson
McCullers or Flannery O'Connor _ bruised and lonely people who,
once Kennedy has had her way with them, come to seem achingly
familiar and even ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Alienation is her province, in other words, a condition she
reminds us is universal by applying it to the walking wounded or
the comically strange: a woman who, let down by faith, perceives
herself as ``God's widow''; an unhappy pastry chef who finds
comfort by standing outside a flour mill in the middle of night.
Though the plots of Kennedy's work often sound like eccentricity
for its own sake, they're actually foils for the more serious
subject of reaching past the wreckage toward a human hand _ a wedge
of literary hope that Kennedy renders with searingly careful prose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Original Bliss,'' appearing here a year ago, was America's
first introduction to Kennedy's work; accordingly, ``So I Am Glad''
may seem like a fast-issue second novel. But in fact its original
publication precedes that of ``Original Bliss'' by a couple of
years, having been issued in Great Britain in 1995. Kennedy's
prolific output includes three novels and two story collections,
and one assumes that all her work will eventually be available in
America, given her longstanding reputation abroad and her recent
discovery here.
</P>
<P>
   As with ``Original Bliss,'' which charted the unlikely collusion
of a self-help guru and a battered wife, ``So I Am Glad'' concerns
a meeting of two minds from wildly disparate worlds _ in this case,
an emotionally sovereign young woman named M. Jennifer Wilson (the
``M'' stands for Mercy) and a rumpled fellow who seems to be the
ghost of Cyrano de Bergerac. The narrator of this tale, Jennifer
insists from the outset that her calculatedly calm inner state _
one in which sex, emotion, and connection have little play _ is
simply the way the model arrived from the factory: that nothing bad
ever happened to her to create this insularity, that her social
responses, when she can figure them out, are studied fabrications.
So we have both Jennifer the ice queen and Jennifer the unreliable
narrator; we already see through her frosty facade, and already
mistrust her guarded delivery of it.
</P>
<P>
   Then a guy falls into her life, in a manner of speaking,
emanating a ghostly glow and suffering amnesia; all he remembers,
he tells her, is ``the absence of God _ a faraway disinterested
ache, a faint taste of intellect on the edge of time.'' But what
does Jennifer care if our newcomer is a bit zany? She herself is an
expert in knowing how to pass, and, given her insularity, her
criteria for friends are not all that demanding. Known as Martin
because he's mistaken for a new housemate by the same name, the man
eventually reveals himself to Jennifer as Savinien _ first name of
Cyrano de Bergerac, and as romantic a 17th-century fellow as you
ever found in a 20th-century Glasgow kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   However implausible this sounds as the plot of a novel, the
story of ``So I Am Glad'' insinuates itself in the reader's
consciousness with fluid ease. Soon enough, one is not only taken
with the burgeoning courtship between Savinien and Jennifer, but
entranced by the complexity of the design that Kennedy has wrought.
Some of this immersion is achieved because she is wickedly funny
(on the romantic limits of onanism, for example, where ``we didn't
send flowers, we never phoned'') and wickedly wicked (rarely has
sadomasochism been explored to such sad-scary effect). And some of
the novel's power derives from its intellectual underpinnings: In
casting Cyrano as the ultimate modern suitor for a frozen heroine,
Kennedy constructs an elegantly parallel universe shifting between
two historical periods _ where physical violence, political
cruelty, and moral depravity walk the same streets in similar
garbs. But even these accomplishments might belong to the realm of
cleverness without Kennedy's vast skill as a portraitist. Both her
dialogue and her descriptive prose have the precision of a fine
surgeon; there are no wasted words here, and consequently an
absolute reality created in the end.
</P>
<P>
   And Jennifer, of course, with her touchingly untrustworthy
defense mechanisms, gets to offer the transformative possibilities
of love as well as fiction. A ``professional enunciator'' by trade,
she's a radio voice who has found great succor in her soundproof
world: She can articulate and control to her heart's content, and
nobody can get to her when the studio door is closed. Remote by
effort, she is never coy, and it's not long before the reader
learns the early reasons for her castle of reserve. But Savinien,
with his physical shortcomings and tender integrity and great,
great love for the world and Jennifer, penetrates that silent
arena; the result is not just a love story, but a swipe of great
passion against the loneliest realm of all, which is despair. ``You
are the person who makes me mind the empty spaces I have,'' she
writes Savinien, ``and the empty rooms.'' Is there a better or more
simple definition of earthly love?
</P>
<P>
   Cursed and blessed with the consequences of loving her ghostly
Savinien, Jennifer becomes something of a writer _ a choice her
Cyrano has long understood. ``It's something to do, to write, isn't
it?'' he tells her. ``When life has baffled an author and hidden
its possibilities, then he can always write.'' With its narrator
often giving us a glimpse of Jennifer and Kennedy both, ``So I Am
Glad'' is carefully generous with such commentary, finding in its
romance flung between the centuries a remarkably affecting novel
about love and courage. About getting lost at the darkest edges of
the seas, and finding the way back toward light.

!! 1/2 ``Girl, Interrupted'' There's a lot of skilled, responsible
work onscreen in James Mangold's attempt to film Susanna Kaysen's
memoir of institutionalization. But while Winona Ryder brings all
the intelligence and sentience to the central role that one could
hope for, Kaysen is less compelling than she needs to be
dramatically, partly because we always sense that her problems are
not that acute, and that she can pull back while the others can't,
especially Angelina Jolie's charismatic sociopath, a surefire Oscar

likable 1995 comedy plays like ``Boyz N the Hood'' Lite. So Lite,
in fact, that it threatens to drift off the screen entirely. Lazy
scripting, which includes excessive reliance on flatulence and
excrement jokes, sinks a promising idea _ the nice guy played by
Ice Cube flees the 'hood when he hears a vengeful bully is coming

`CHILLI' OF TLC: FEUD, WHAT FEUD? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bad behavior usually translates to great publicity for pop
groups. But at a certain point the rewards of coddling the
designated wild child's antics are obscured by the toll inflicted
on everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Take TLC, the female R&AMP;B-rap trio that has just been nominated
for six Grammys, including album of the year for 1999's
``Fanmail.'' Lisa ``Left Eye'' Lopes _ the self-described Crazy in
the ``CrazySexyCool'' triumvirate _ has been generating headaches
and headlines for years: fights with the police, arrests for
disorderly conduct, and of course the infamous accidental torching
of her boyfriend's mansion. Last year Lopes sent a letter to the
group's record company, LaFace, threatening to quit TLC, which
temporarily froze the notoriously money-troubled group's finances.
She later said it was an attention-getting ploy. And then there's
the string of canceled interviews, ruined photo shoots, and missed
television appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows that Lisa is the one who rebels,'' says Rozanda
``Chilli'' Thomas on the phone from Atlanta. Thomas is the
smooth-voiced, Sexy third of TLC who sings the recent hits
``Unpretty'' and ``No Scrubs.'' Everyone also knows how Thomas and
Tionne ``T-Boz'' Watkins (the Cool piece of the puzzle) feel about
Lopes's behavior, since the two made their displeasure very public
in an Entertainment Weekly article last November. ``Evil,''
``selfish,'' and ``heartless'' were just a few of the descriptives
used. Lopes shot back with a challenge to release three competing
solo albums. And so on and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on the brink of a national tour, a subdued Thomas _ clearly
tired of addressing the group's internal strife _ is backpedaling
hard. ``Every group goes through stuff,'' she says
matter-of-factly. ``You have to agree to disagree. That writer at
Entertainment Weekly? It was just his lucky day.'' Thomas says that
the group is not, as rumored, on the verge of a breakup. But her
claims ring of retreat more than conviction. ``TLC is such a
priority for me that I don't even think that way. I can't see a
breakup. If there is one, it's far away.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is a good thing for the music world. With ``No Scrubs''
and ``Unpretty,'' TLC released a pair of stellar pop-soul songs
that sport not only catchy hooks, but also serious messages. Both
have struck nerves with a surprising cross-section of music fans _
men included, even though both tracks come across as feminist
anthems and have inspired their share of gender feuds. `` `No
Scrubs,' '' says Thomas, ``is not male-bashing. It's talking about
a certain kind of guy that a lot of guys don't even like'' _ the
type that mooch off their mothers, ignore their kids, and can
generally be found, as the lyric goes, ``hangin' out the
passenger's side of his best friend's ride/ tryin' to holler at
me.'' ``And every woman,'' Thomas points out, ``has had that
experience, of being in the car and some guy drives up and tries to
talk to you. That's why it was so big.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unpretty,'' a deceptively delicate ballad about the perils of
relying on others to form your self-image, displays a new level of
introspection for TLC. ``This group has gone through so much stuff,
how could you not come out more mature?'' Thomas says. Indeed, in
addition to the group's well-publicized conflicts, Watkins is
struggling with sickle cell anemia, and Thomas is trying to balance
career and motherhood; she's raising her 2-year-old son in Atlanta
with TLC producer Dallas Austin. ``To me, it's Part 2 of
`Waterfalls,' '' Thomas says, referring to TLC's 1994 hit from the
10-times platinum ``CrazySexyCool.'' ``It's really talking about
something very universal.''
</P>
<P>
   But she's quick to point out that trying to match past successes
is something TLC couldn't imagine on the heels of a five-year
recording hiatus, during which the group filed for _ and ultimately
recovered from _ bankruptcy. ``My main goal for `Fanmail' was to
never get caught up in what we sold before. I just wanted people to
embrace us again.'' With 4 million copies of ``Fanmail'' sold so
far and a handful of Grammy nominations sure to fuel the fire, TLC
has little to worry about in terms of fan support. The question is
no longer whether they'll be embraced by an audience, but whether
they'll embrace each other. ``TLC has chemistry,'' says Thomas.
``It's natural. It's magical. That's something you can't take away.
We could go out,'' she insists, ``and do our thing forever.''

SHARON STONE, INDIE QUEEN? 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of Sharon Stone in a scene from
``Simpatico.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    These days the biggest stars shine in some of the most unlikely
places.
 &HT;    Take, for example, Sharon Stone, blossoming indie queen.
 &HT;    Arguably the sexiest screen siren of the 1990s, Stone made her
name in the big-budget likes of ``Total Recall'' (1990), ``Basic
Instinct'' (1992) and ``The Specialist'' (1994). Lately, though,
she's been seen most often in far more modest productions such as
``The Mighty'' (1998) and ``The Muse'' (1999).
 &HT;    Her latest film, ``Simpatico,'' which will open Jan. 21, is
another independent feature.
 &HT;    What gives?
 &HT;    ``I believe that these kinds of films, in 10 or 20 years, will
have filmic value,'' Stone says during a conversation at New York's
Essex House. As always, the 41-year-old actress is a live wire,
talkative and forthright.
 &HT;    ``I believe that we're actually doing work to be proud of, and
work that will stand the test of time,'' she says. ``Even though I
like to get paid sometimes, too, this is far more interesting to me
at this time in my life than a paycheck.
 &HT;    ``Also, the emotional rewards, the spiritual rewards ... it's
ethically rewarding,'' the actress says. ``It's an odd thing to
say, but it is.''
 &HT;    Based on the Sam Shepard play, ``Simpatico'' stars Jeff Bridges
as Lyle Carter, a wealthy horse breeder, with Stone as Rosie,
Lyle's reclusive, alcoholic wife. Nick Nolte plays Vinnie, an old
pal of the couple who's now a total lush. When Vinnie decides to
right old wrongs and betray long-buried secrets, the trio's lives
are thrown into a life-threatening spiral.
 &HT;    Rosie is a highly volatile character, the actress says.
 &HT;    ``It's a very dangerous place to live, psychologically,'' she
says. ``And, unlike the character, I haven't been loaded for 25
years to numb it.''
 &HT;    Stone credits the film's writer/director, Matthew Warchus, for
providing the emotional safety net required by such a demanding
role.
 &HT;    ``He made it safe for me to go there,'' she says.
 &HT;    Whether or not audiences go there along with Stone, Bridges and
Nolte remains to be seen. ``Simpatico'' is dark, disturbing stuff,
and Stone knows it.
 &HT;    ``People are either enraptured with the movie or they're
confused by it,'' she says. ``They're emotionally torn up by the
movie, and they either like that or they don't.
 &HT;    ``Shepard writes for the intellectual,'' she adds, ``but very
few people write for the intellectual from an emotional standpoint.
I think that's extraordinary. For me, that was about as challenging
a kind of work as there is.''
 &HT;    Although Stone feels strongly about her character and the
caliber of her co-star's performances, she admits that
``Simpatico'' is probably not a movie for everybody _ though she
points out that many classics, including Martin Scorsese's ``Raging
Bull'' (1980), haven't found their audiences right away.
 &HT;    ``Like any movie, it doesn't have to be for the moment it's
made,'' she says. ```Raging Bull' didn't win an Oscar, and now it's
probably considered one of the finest films that's ever been
made.''
 &HT;    Stone will follow ``Simpatico'' with several intriguing
projects. She'll join Woody Allen in director Alfonso Arau's
pitch-black comedy ``Picking Up the Pieces'' and get romantic with
Billy Connolly in ``Beautiful Joe.''
 &HT;    The actress will also share the small screen with Ellen
DeGeneres in ``Misconceptions,'' a segment of HBO's anthology ``If
These Walls Could Talk 2'' written and directed by DeGeneres'
lover, Anne Heche.
 &HT;    ``I think they're just great,'' Stone says. ``Ellen is just the
most wonderful comedienne and Anne is so smart and such a great
actor. The script she wrote was great, and I knew she'd be able to
direct.
 &HT;    ``It was so much fun because it was all girls, a girl crew, a
girl assistant director,'' Stone adds with a laugh. ``I have to say
I really enjoyed that kind of experience. I've seen the piece, and
it's marvelous.''
 &HT;    In ``Picking Up the Pieces,'' Allen dismembers his wife (Stone)
and buries her body parts throughout Mexico. When someone discovers
Stone's hand, it immediately becomes a religious icon.
 &HT;    ``It's more than a cameo,'' says Stone, who made her movie debut
with a fleeting bit as a crazed fan in Allen's ``Stardust
Memories'' (1980). ``I have a few scenes in flashback, and I have a
really terrific scene where I come back from the dead and talk to
Woody in his jail cell. I'm in my baby-doll nightgown, with two
feet of red hair, seven-inch heels, a fake fur coat and a dog in my
handbag.
 &HT;    ``That scene is why I took the part.''
 &HT;    As for ``Beautiful Joe,'' the film was both a joy for Stone and
one of the most difficult experiences of her career.
 &HT;    ``Billy Connolly is so, so great to work with,'' she says. ``It
was such a pleasure.''
 &HT;    But with only five days of filming to go, Stone received
devastating news: Her husband, San Francisco newspaperman Phil
Bronstein, had suffered a heart attack. She rushed to his side,
only to return to the movie set shortly thereafter.
 &HT;    ``I had to come back, and I had to come right back,'' she says.
``Legally I had to come right back to work, and that was
horrifying. I couldn't stand being there _ every second was just
hell. I wanted to get the hell out of there and get back home.
 &HT;    ``But every other day on the film was the most extraordinary
experience.''
 &HT;    The actress is happy to add that Bronstein has recovered
admirably.
 &HT;    ``He's fabulous,'' Stone says, practically shouting. ``He's
better than ever.''
 &HT;    On a note nearly as positive, it's widely believed that Stone
will secure an Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actress for her
comic turn as the flamboyant title character in Albert Brooks'
comedy ``The Muse.''
 &HT;    If it happens, Stone makes it abundantly clear that she'll be
more than pleased.
 &HT;    ``Honey, I want to be nominated for everything,'' she jokes. ``I
want to be nominated for cleaning my house. And I should be.''
 &HT;    Even if the Oscar should come her way, however, it's still a
fact that ``The Muse'' didn't ring up great numbers at the box
office. Stone's recent films have been at best middling successes,
and there's no denying that her career could use a solid hit _ if
only to help draw moviegoers to her more adventurous independent
films.
 &HT;    ``I'm sure it would be a good idea,'' the actress says, nodding,
``but maybe I'll get recognition for `The Muse' in a way that will
do that.
 &HT;    ``If I can get recognition for my work first, that's more
interesting to me,'' she adds. ``Yes, I like when movies are hits _
who doesn't? But it's wonderful to be recognized for your work
first.''
 &HT;    Stone pauses.
 &HT;    ``I think my work in `Basic Instinct' holds up today,'' she
says, ``but I'm still not recognized, today, for my work in that.
Maybe when I'm 60 ...
 &HT;    ``Well, I'll probably still be threatening,'' she admits.
``Maybe when I'm dead.''

entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of Nathan Lane with Bette Midler in a scene
from ``Isn't She Great.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Nathan Lane is getting catty.
 &HT;    The actor, who provides the voice for Snowbell the cat in the
holiday hit ``Stuart Little,'' claims that the titular mouse was
given a much nicer trailer on the set than he was.
 &HT;    It's tough being a cat in a mouse picture.
 &HT;    ``Even though Stuart was computer-generated,'' Lane says, ``we
still had mice around the set to remind us of their habits. When no
one was around, I would whisper to them, `Steel traps, boys.'''
 &HT;    Actually, Lane says more seriously, ``Stuart Little'' was his
favorite book as a child.
 &HT;    ``I can recall details, like them lowering Stuart into the
kitchen sink on a thread to retrieve Mrs. Little's wedding ring,''
he says. ``It didn't end happily. Stuart goes off and searches for
his true love. I kept thinking, `Ugh, he's never gonna find her.'
 &HT;    ``Even then I saw the futility of love,'' the actor says,
rolling his eyes. ``I thought, `How many 4-inch women are there out
there?'''
 &HT;    Lane has some previous experience with mice, having starred in
``Mouse Hunt'' (1997). Given the box-office success of ``Stuart
Little,'' as well as the crowd-pleasing mouse in ``The Green Mile''
(1999), mouse movies seem to be hot in Hollywood.
 &HT;    ``Oh goody, you've spotted the trend,'' Lane jokes. ``Now the
only thing left to do is `The Rat Pack' and `Mighty Mouse,' and
then I can retire. Then I've done the entire rodent catalog of
films.''
 &HT;    In the meantime, the versatile star of ``The Bird Cage'' (1996)
and the voice of Timon in ``The Lion King'' (1994) plays a
different kind of Hollywood animal in his new movie, ``Isn't She
Great,'' a biopic of the pop novelist Jacqueline Susann (Bette
Midler) which will open Jan. 28.
 &HT;    Lane plays Susann's husband, Irving Mansfield, in a cast that
also features John Cleese, David Hyde Pierce, Stockard Channing,
John Larroquette and Sarah Jessica Parker. The film, with a Paul
Rudnick screenplay that focuses on the creation of Susann's most
famous _ and most scandalous _ book, ``Valley of the Dolls''
(1966), is based on Barbara Seaman's biography, ``Lovely Me: The
Life of Jacqueline Susann'' (Seven Story Press, 1996).
 &HT;    ``It's not that sordid Michelle Lee cable movie that was on a
few months ago,'' Lane says. ``Frankly, I couldn't take my eyes off
that one, because it was mesmerizing in its total vulgarity and
horribleness. It was like every trashy story you've ever heard
about Jacqueline and Irving.''
 &HT;    To prepare for his role, Lane watched old television interviews
with Mansfield.
 &HT;    ``I watched old Dinah Shore shows,'' he says. ``When he talked
about his wife, you just saw the love. And they were real
show-business animals _ everything was about show business. But he
was so devoted to her that Irving wanted Jackie to be as famous as
she wanted to be.
 &HT;    ``You have to admire their guts and determination.''
 &HT;    The story, set in the 1960s and 1970s, includes Susann's
well-publicized feud with Truman Capote, who once said that she
``dressed like a truck driver in drag.''
 &HT;    ``There is a scene where we watch Truman saying these things on
television,'' Lane says. ``And Bette and I throw things at the TV
screen.''
 &HT;    The raucous Midler was a natural to play Susann, the actor adds.
 &HT;    ``She's a ball of fire,'' he says. ``It's a wonderful role for
her _ she gets to be funny and flashy, plus she gets to have a
hospital deathbed scene. And, frankly, what more could any actor
ask for in a movie?''
 &HT;    Lane grew up in Jersey City, N.J., a world away from the glamour
of show business.
 &HT;    ``It was a family where you had to grow up fast,'' he recalls.
``My father was a very self-destructive person. And it was very sad
_ he was an alcoholic who died when I was 11. He essentially drank
himself to death.''
 &HT;    Unpopular and overweight, Lane found a saving grace in his older
brother, Dan, who took him to see plays in New York. Fascinated, at
age 18 Lane moved to New York to pursue his dream of being an
actor.
 &HT;    He lived in a cramped apartment with ``about 10,000 other
struggling actors,'' he jokes. ``Rent was very cheap _ we each paid
$1 a month.''
 &HT;    Lane was working delivering singing telegrams when he got his
first break, a short-lived 1982 television series with Mickey
Rooney, ``One of the Boys.'' The cast also included future stars
Meg Ryan and Dana Carvey.
 &HT;    Although the show bombed, Lane found doors opening, especially
on Broadway. A series of increasingly prominent stage roles led to
his acclaimed star turns in ``Guys and Dolls'' (1992), ``Love!
Valour! Compassion!'' (1994) and ``A Funny Thing Happened on the
Way to the Forum'' (1996).
 &HT;    Along the way, Lane began to be seen in a variety of films _
including, ironically, a bit part in the television movie
``Jacqueline Susann's Valley of the Dolls'' (1981). His most
memorable films include ``Frankie and Johnny'' (1991), ``Addams
Family Values'' (1993) and ``Jeffrey'' (1995).
 &HT;    The small screen, however, has not proven so kind: Lane's recent
television series, ``Encore! Encore!'', was canceled after only a
few episodes.
 &HT;    Back on the big screen, Lane co-stars in Kenneth Branagh's
upcoming ``Love's Labour's Lost,'' a musical version of the
Shakespeare classic that also features Branagh, Matthew Lillard and
Alicia Silverstone.
 &HT;    ``We're singing and dancing and doing the Bard,'' Lane says. ``I
get to sing `There's No Business Like Show Business.' I play the
clown character _ he's a vaudevillian who is down on his luck. He
walks around with this little suitcase of rubber chickens.''
 &HT;    And no, Lane says, there's nothing to the English tabloid rumors
that Branagh and Silverstone dated during filming.
 &HT;    ``We were working seven days a week,'' he says. ``I don't think
either one of them had time for an affair. We were working very
hard.''
 &HT;    Lane's return to Broadway, co-starring with Victor Garber in
Stephen Sondheim's new musical ``Wise Guys,'' was recently derailed
when the production was shut down for retooling. In the meantime,
he's weighing movie offers, including a possible sequel to ``The
Bird Cage,'' which he still regards as his biggest career break.
 &HT;    ``Of course that movie, and last year GQ magazine named me as
one of their Men of the Year,'' he says.
 &HT;    Lane heaves a fake sob.
 &HT;    ``It was very moving to me,'' he says, smiling. ``As you know, I
was the Theater Man of the Year. So you can only imagine what an
ugly battle that was. It was between me and Carol Channing, and
they gave it to me!''
 &HT;    And his prize?
 &HT;    ``I got a free trip to GQ Land, where you can see anorexic
supermodels in their natural habitat,'' Lane says. ``However,
you're not allowed to feed them.''
 &HT;    He's delighted to get a laugh.
 &HT;    ``The best feeling is to make other people laugh,'' he says.
``When I hear laughter, something clicks in my head. I think, `This
is what I really love more than anything else in the world _ just
the feeling of people having a great time.'
 &HT;    ``You really can't ask for more.''

A MATTER OF FAITH: FAITH HILL AND THE POWER OF A SONG 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of country singer Faith Hill.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    The fundamental things may still apply, but a kiss is more than
just a kiss.
 &HT;    Just ask Faith Hill. Her million-selling 1998 hit, ``This
Kiss,'' launched a wave of success that has seen Hill vault from
mere country-music stardom to become the most significant pop-music
crossover this side of Shania Twain.
 &HT;    The song sparked sales of more than 3 million copies of Hill's
third album, ``Faith,'' helped her snare five Academy of Country
Music Awards and earned her a spot alongside Cher, Whitney Houston
and Tina Turner on VH1's ``Divas Live '99.''
 &HT;    Moreover, it provided a springboard for her new album,
``Breathe'' (1999), to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard charts,
selling nearly 250,000 copies in its first week of release.
 &HT;    In other words, the 32-year-old Hill is no longer merely the
wife of country singer Tim McGraw, the mother of their two
daughters and her husband's perennial opening act. She's a star in
her own right.
 &HT;    Despite her meteoric rise, Hill has kept herself grounded
through family life. She takes her daughters, 2-year-old Gracie and
1-year-old Maggie, on the road with her, and brings the family
together whenever she can.
 &HT;    Some singers come to resent the success of their biggest hits,
feeling overshadowed by their own songs, but Hill appreciates
everything ``This Kiss'' has done for her.
 &HT;    ``It just kind of shows the power of a song,'' she says. ``It's
continuing to be played, across the board _ even around the world.
It was a huge record in Germany, South Africa ... just
everywhere.''
 &HT;    Hill recounts a friend's supermarket encounter with a teen-ager
who spotted Hill on the cover of a country magazine.
 &HT;    ``The girl shouts _ `Mom! The ``This Kiss'' girl ... is country!
Did you know that? Do you believe that?''' Hill says, laughing. ``I
thought it was hysterical.''
 &HT;    But beneath Hill's laughter lies the age-old lament of the
artist who resists being pigeonholed.
 &HT;    ``I don't want to be pegged as anything,'' she says. ``I just
want to be respected as an artist that's trying to do great music.
I really don't see any crime in that.''
 &HT;    Some in Nashville do, however. Like mass-audience breakouts
Twain and Garth Brooks before her, Hill has been attacked for
betraying the faith, forsaking her country roots to chase broader
pop success. Critics have slammed her new provocative, skin-baring
image, her Vogue photo sessions and her recent deal to be one of
the faces of Cover Girl cosmetics.
 &HT;    Hill pleads guilty as charged _ except for that part about
betraying the faith.
 &HT;    ``I don't forget where I come from,'' the singer says. ``I'm not
trying to be anybody else. I'm not trying to be Shania, I'm not
trying to be Whitney Houston or anybody else.
 &HT;    ``I have an incredible respect for the establishment of country
music,'' she insists. ``I was inspired by it. It molded and shaped
who I am today _ but so did a lot of other sounds.''
 &HT;    Gospel was the first music that the former Faith Perry, the
adopted daughter of a factory worker and a retired bank employee,
sang while growing up in Star, Miss. Her mother remembers Faith as
a prodigy who belted songs at age 3 and gave her first public
performance at 10, for a women's-club luncheon. Soon she had taught
herself to play guitar and write songs.
 &HT;    After one semester of college, Hill left home in early 1987 to
pursue her star in Nashville. Doors did not open, and she soon
found herself on the very fringes of the industry, working in the
T-shirt booth at the annual Fan Fair festival and then at the
receptionist's desk at a music-publishing company.
 &HT;    Hill, who was married for four years to songwriter Dan Hill,
later landed a job sending out mail-order souvenirs to Reba
McEntire's fans. She auditioned to be one of McEntire's backup
singers, but lost out to Paula Kaye Evans _ who was killed, along
with most of the group, in a 1991 plane crash. Hill, meanwhile,
honed her skills in clubs and was signed by Warner Bros. Records in
1992.
 &HT;    Her first two albums _ ``Take Me as I Am'' (1993) and ``It
Matters to Me'' (1995) _ did well, but didn't reach beyond the
country realm. For ``Faith'' she added a second producer _ Byron
Gallimore, who also worked with McGraw and Jo Dee Messina _ to
handle some tracks along with her longtime collaborator Dan Huff.
 &HT;    ``I realized I didn't have to necessarily record with just one
producer on an album,'' Hill says. ``That opened up this whole
other world of thinking.''
 &HT;    Meshing two producers with different styles proved difficult,
Hill admits, ``but they each brought something that made a great
partnership.''
 &HT;    In the wake of ``Faith's'' success, the team remained intact,
with song selection and recording for what would become ``Breathe''
going on even as Hill staged her first tour as a headliner last
summer.
 &HT;    ``I want to grow on stage as well, so when I go and choose a
song for a record, I think about how it's going to translate to my
fans from the stage,'' she says. ``I tour _ that's part of who I am
right now. I wanted to make an album that was going to be fun to
bring to the road.''
 &HT;    That doesn't mean ``Breathe'' is without tender moments. Hill
recorded Bruce Springsteen's quiet expression of devotion, ``If I
Should Fall Behind,'' while her duet with McGraw on ``Let's Make
Love'' makes married love seem positively sinful.
 &HT;    ``It's a very romantic, very sensual song,'' Hill acknowledges
with a laugh. ``We weren't groping each other or anything like
that, but we certainly meant what we were singing. It was a special
moment for us _ it was nice just being in there together, doing
it.''
 &HT;    Hill plans to hit the road for another tour in support of
``Breathe,'' and she hints that McGraw might join her as a
co-headliner.
 &HT;    If ``Breathe'' sustains the breakthrough she made with
``Faith,'' Hill is entirely aware that the Nashville backlash will
only intensify. But she's prepared for whatever her critics may
dish out.
 &HT;    ``I'm strong,'' she says. ``I just want to do what I do and stay
focused. I don't think they are going to stifle me ... I feel very
comfortable where I am now, and I'm very proud of the record. What
is on that record is just a collection of songs that I really,
really loved and had fun with.
 &HT;    ``I'm just growing and being who I am right now,'' she
concludes. ``That's all I can ever be _ or ever want to be,
really.''

 (Includes a color slide of Tim Matheson in a scene from ``The West

 By BRIAN HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be released in Canada before Jan. 23. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan's success notwithstanding, it's not easy for an
actor to make it to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Matheson knows that firsthand. Despite an impressive resume
with more than 100 credits, Matheson had to audition for the role
of Vice President John Hoynes on the new hit political drama, ``The
West Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he says, he didn't mind trying out for the part.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of agents said to me, `You shouldn't have to audition,
they should just hire you,''' he recalls. ``But I said, `These are
the best people in town, and they're not just going to hire
somebody _ they're going to want to see them.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I've got no false pride about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The people in question were ``West Wing'' executive producers
Aaron Sorkin and Thomas Schlamme. Sorkin is the author of ``A Few
Good Men'' (1992) and ``The American President'' (1996), as well as
the creator of ``Sports Night,'' while Schlamme has produced
``Chicago Hope'' and ``Tracey Takes On.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a big fan of all their work, and they were both there,''
Matheson recalls. ``So we played around with the material, and it
just worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   The producers are equally pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were incredibly lucky to get Tim for this role,'' Sorkin
says. ``He actually looks like a vice president, if you know what I
mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Matheson based his vice-presidential portrayal not on current
veep Al Gore, or on recent incumbents such as Dan Quayle or George
Bush. Instead he reached back 35 years to Vice President Lyndon B.
Johnson, later president after the murder of President John F.
Kennedy in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   The often-tense Johnson-Kennedy dynamic _ the two had been
rivals for the Democratic nomination in 1960 _ is reflected in the
strained relationship between Hoynes and President Josiah Bartlett
(Martin Sheen).
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnson was a man of incredible ego and accomplishment,''
Matheson says. ``And he felt he'd been usurped by a younger, less
experienced, more glamorous politician in Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The fictional vice president is younger than his real-life
model. But, like Johnson, Hoynes brings to his office a wealth of
political experience which he feels isn't utilized by the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got his own, strong agenda,'' Matheson says, ``and
perhaps doesn't hide it as much as he should, in light of the fact
that the president treats him shabbily.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent episodes, Bartlett's animosity toward Hoynes has been
attributed to Hoynes' having wavered before accepting Bartlett's
offer of the vice-presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't have made me beg,'' Bartlett said.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from that incident has left the president and his
staff trying to keep the outspoken Hoynes on a short leash.
</P>
<P>
   It's essential to the story line, Sorkin says, that the audience
realize that the vice president is not merely a figurehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president is a major part of the overall presidency,
despite what people think,'' the writer/producer explains. ``A lot
of people in the U.S. think that the veep doesn't really do
anything _ that's not how it works on our show.''
</P>
<P>
   Matheson agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes for good conflict, which in turn makes for good
drama,'' the actor says. ``It's good character development and a
lot of fun to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Matheson can rightfully call himself an authority on
characterization, having played scores of roles in his three
decades in film and television. Best known for ``National Lampoon's
Animal House'' (1978), Matheson actually had a flourishing career
well before then _ in fact, that film came near the halfway point
of his career to date.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, one of his first credits was a guest spot on
a 1962 episode of ``Leave it to Beaver.'' He was 15 _ though he
managed to escape the various hazards that have tripped up numerous
other former child actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky not being on a huge hit show or being a kid star
like Gary Coleman or so many others,'' he says, ``because they face
a huge burden overcoming the identities they've created.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as Matheson is concerned, there are only two choices for
a child actor once he or she hits the teen-age years: get out of
the business or make the transition to adult actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smart ones, like Jodie Foster and Kurt Russell, who were
both stars, both quit for a while,'' he says. ``Whereas with me, I
hit my lean years and made the transition by doing more voice work
offscreen.''
</P>
<P>
   As his teen years passed, Matheson dutifully went to school
before moving on to the big screen and films such as ``Divorce,
American Style'' (1967) with Dick Van Dyke and ``Yours, Mine and
Ours'' (1968) with Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball.
</P>
<P>
   His career continued during the 1970s with regular work on
dramatic series such as ``Bonanza,'' ``The Quest'' and ``How the
West Was Won.'' Then came ``Animal House,'' a film he recalls as a
welcome change of pace.
</P>
<P>
   Bored with being typecast as the nice guy next door, he adds, he
``wanted to break out. Before `Animal House' I'd never done
comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, ``Animal House'' led Matheson to more comedy
roles during the 1980s, including the lighthearted series
``Tucker's Witch'' (1982-1983), as well as the feature films ``Up
the Creek'' (1984) and ``Fletch'' (1985).
</P>
<P>
   But while most of the scripts he was offered were comedies,
Matheson strove to maintain balance, to escape being pigeonholed as
either a comedian or strictly a dramatic actor. He also took on
regular stage work, to be sure that he didn't evolve into purely a
movie or television actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything an actor can do to broaden his range is a valuable
tool and will lead to longevity,'' he says. ``I try to keep growing
and learning and changing because, really, it gets boring
otherwise. Even the audience gets bored.''
</P>
<P>
   Range is all very well, but it surely doesn't hurt that the
53-year-old father of three has remained remarkably youthful, a
fact he attributes more to genetics and makeup than to anything
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, if you have a really good cameraman, you can look
younger longer,'' Matheson adds.
</P>
<P>
   To judge by its ratings, ``The West Wing'' is in for a long run,
which means Vice President Hoynes will be around for a while _
which suits Matheson fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working on `West Wing' has been incredibly rewarding,'' he
says, ``because it's an adult show with bright, intelligent,
literate dialogue and multifaceted characters ... which you just
don't find on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, for that matter, very often in Washington.

SHARON STONE, INDIE QUEEN? 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of Sharon Stone in a scene from
``Simpatico.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    These days the biggest stars shine in some of the most unlikely
places.
 &HT;    Take, for example, Sharon Stone, blossoming indie queen.
 &HT;    Arguably the sexiest screen siren of the 1990s, Stone made her
name in the big-budget likes of ``Total Recall'' (1990), ``Basic
Instinct'' (1992) and ``The Specialist'' (1994). Lately, though,
she's been seen most often in far more modest productions such as
``The Mighty'' (1998) and ``The Muse'' (1999).
 &HT;    Her latest film, ``Simpatico,'' which will open Jan. 21, is
another independent feature.
 &HT;    What gives?
 &HT;    ``I believe that these kinds of films, in 10 or 20 years, will
have filmic value,'' Stone says during a conversation at New York's
Essex House. As always, the 41-year-old actress is a live wire,
talkative and forthright.
 &HT;    ``I believe that we're actually doing work to be proud of, and
work that will stand the test of time,'' she says. ``Even though I
like to get paid sometimes, too, this is far more interesting to me
at this time in my life than a paycheck.
 &HT;    ``Also, the emotional rewards, the spiritual rewards ... it's
ethically rewarding,'' the actress says. ``It's an odd thing to
say, but it is.''
 &HT;    Based on the Sam Shepard play, ``Simpatico'' stars Jeff Bridges
as Lyle Carter, a wealthy horse breeder, with Stone as Rosie,
Lyle's reclusive, alcoholic wife. Nick Nolte plays Vinnie, an old
pal of the couple who's now a total lush. When Vinnie decides to
right old wrongs and betray long-buried secrets, the trio's lives
are thrown into a life-threatening spiral.
 &HT;    Rosie is a highly volatile character, the actress says.
 &HT;    ``It's a very dangerous place to live, psychologically,'' she
says. ``And, unlike the character, I haven't been loaded for 25
years to numb it.''
 &HT;    Stone credits the film's writer/director, Matthew Warchus, for
providing the emotional safety net required by such a demanding
role.
 &HT;    ``He made it safe for me to go there,'' she says.
 &HT;    Whether or not audiences go there along with Stone, Bridges and
Nolte remains to be seen. ``Simpatico'' is dark, disturbing stuff,
and Stone knows it.
 &HT;    ``People are either enraptured with the movie or they're
confused by it,'' she says. ``They're emotionally torn up by the
movie, and they either like that or they don't.
 &HT;    ``Shepard writes for the intellectual,'' she adds, ``but very
few people write for the intellectual from an emotional standpoint.
I think that's extraordinary. For me, that was about as challenging
a kind of work as there is.''
 &HT;    Although Stone feels strongly about her character and the
caliber of her co-star's performances, she admits that
``Simpatico'' is probably not a movie for everybody _ though she
points out that many classics, including Martin Scorsese's ``Raging
Bull'' (1980), haven't found their audiences right away.
 &HT;    ``Like any movie, it doesn't have to be for the moment it's
made,'' she says. ```Raging Bull' didn't win an Oscar, and now it's
probably considered one of the finest films that's ever been
made.''
 &HT;    Stone will follow ``Simpatico'' with several intriguing
projects. She'll join Woody Allen in director Alfonso Arau's
pitch-black comedy ``Picking Up the Pieces'' and get romantic with
Billy Connolly in ``Beautiful Joe.''
 &HT;    The actress will also share the small screen with Ellen
DeGeneres in ``Misconceptions,'' a segment of HBO's anthology ``If
These Walls Could Talk 2'' written and directed by DeGeneres'
lover, Anne Heche.
 &HT;    ``I think they're just great,'' Stone says. ``Ellen is just the
most wonderful comedienne and Anne is so smart and such a great
actor. The script she wrote was great, and I knew she'd be able to
direct.
 &HT;    ``It was so much fun because it was all girls, a girl crew, a
girl assistant director,'' Stone adds with a laugh. ``I have to say
I really enjoyed that kind of experience. I've seen the piece, and
it's marvelous.''
 &HT;    In ``Picking Up the Pieces,'' Allen dismembers his wife (Stone)
and buries her body parts throughout Mexico. When someone discovers
Stone's hand, it immediately becomes a religious icon.
 &HT;    ``It's more than a cameo,'' says Stone, who made her movie debut
with a fleeting bit as a crazed fan in Allen's ``Stardust
Memories'' (1980). ``I have a few scenes in flashback, and I have a
really terrific scene where I come back from the dead and talk to
Woody in his jail cell. I'm in my baby-doll nightgown, with two
feet of red hair, seven-inch heels, a fake fur coat and a dog in my
handbag.
 &HT;    ``That scene is why I took the part.''
 &HT;    As for ``Beautiful Joe,'' the film was both a joy for Stone and
one of the most difficult experiences of her career.
 &HT;    ``Billy Connolly is so, so great to work with,'' she says. ``It
was such a pleasure.''
 &HT;    But with only five days of filming to go, Stone received
devastating news: Her husband, San Francisco newspaperman Phil
Bronstein, had suffered a heart attack. She rushed to his side,
only to return to the movie set shortly thereafter.
 &HT;    ``I had to come back, and I had to come right back,'' she says.
``Legally I had to come right back to work, and that was
horrifying. I couldn't stand being there _ every second was just
hell. I wanted to get the hell out of there and get back home.
 &HT;    ``But every other day on the film was the most extraordinary
experience.''
 &HT;    The actress is happy to add that Bronstein has recovered
admirably.
 &HT;    ``He's fabulous,'' Stone says, practically shouting. ``He's
better than ever.''
 &HT;    On a note nearly as positive, it's widely believed that Stone
will secure an Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actress for her
comic turn as the flamboyant title character in Albert Brooks'
comedy ``The Muse.''
 &HT;    If it happens, Stone makes it abundantly clear that she'll be
more than pleased.
 &HT;    ``Honey, I want to be nominated for everything,'' she jokes. ``I
want to be nominated for cleaning my house. And I should be.''
 &HT;    Even if the Oscar should come her way, however, it's still a
fact that ``The Muse'' didn't ring up great numbers at the box
office. Stone's recent films have been at best middling successes,
and there's no denying that her career could use a solid hit _ if
only to help draw moviegoers to her more adventurous independent
films.
 &HT;    ``I'm sure it would be a good idea,'' the actress says, nodding,
``but maybe I'll get recognition for `The Muse' in a way that will
do that.
 &HT;    ``If I can get recognition for my work first, that's more
interesting to me,'' she adds. ``Yes, I like when movies are hits _
who doesn't? But it's wonderful to be recognized for your work
first.''
 &HT;    Stone pauses.
 &HT;    ``I think my work in `Basic Instinct' holds up today,'' she
says, ``but I'm still not recognized, today, for my work in that.
Maybe when I'm 60 ...
 &HT;    ``Well, I'll probably still be threatening,'' she admits.
``Maybe when I'm dead.''

 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Nathan Lane is getting catty.
 &HT;    The actor, who provides the voice for Snowbell the cat in the
holiday hit ``Stuart Little,'' claims that the titular mouse was
given a much nicer trailer on the set than he was.
 &HT;    It's tough being a cat in a mouse picture.
 &HT;    ``Even though Stuart was computer-generated,'' Lane says, ``we
still had mice around the set to remind us of their habits. When no
one was around, I would whisper to them, `Steel traps, boys.'''
 &HT;    Actually, Lane says more seriously, ``Stuart Little'' was his
favorite book as a child.
 &HT;    ``I can recall details, like them lowering Stuart into the
kitchen sink on a thread to retrieve Mrs. Little's wedding ring,''
he says. ``It didn't end happily. Stuart goes off and searches for
his true love. I kept thinking, `Ugh, he's never gonna find her.'
 &HT;    ``Even then I saw the futility of love,'' the actor says,
rolling his eyes. ``I thought, `How many 4-inch women are there out
there?'''
 &HT;    Lane has some previous experience with mice, having starred in
``Mouse Hunt'' (1997). Given the box-office success of ``Stuart
Little,'' as well as the crowd-pleasing mouse in ``The Green Mile''
(1999), mouse movies seem to be hot in Hollywood.
 &HT;    ``Oh goody, you've spotted the trend,'' Lane jokes. ``Now the
only thing left to do is `The Rat Pack' and `Mighty Mouse,' and
then I can retire. Then I've done the entire rodent catalog of
films.''
 &HT;    In the meantime, the versatile star of ``The Bird Cage'' (1996)
and the voice of Timon in ``The Lion King'' (1994) plays a
different kind of Hollywood animal in his new movie, ``Isn't She
Great,'' a biopic of the pop novelist Jacqueline Susann (Bette
Midler) which will open Jan. 28.
 &HT;    Lane plays Susann's husband, Irving Mansfield, in a cast that
also features John Cleese, David Hyde Pierce, Stockard Channing,
John Larroquette and Sarah Jessica Parker. The film, with a Paul
Rudnick screenplay that focuses on the creation of Susann's most
famous _ and most scandalous _ book, ``Valley of the Dolls''
(1966), is based on Barbara Seaman's biography, ``Lovely Me: The
Life of Jacqueline Susann'' (Seven Story Press, 1996).
 &HT;    ``It's not that sordid Michelle Lee cable movie that was on a
few months ago,'' Lane says. ``Frankly, I couldn't take my eyes off
that one, because it was mesmerizing in its total vulgarity and
horribleness. It was like every trashy story you've ever heard
about Jacqueline and Irving.''
 &HT;    To prepare for his role, Lane watched old television interviews
with Mansfield.
 &HT;    ``I watched old Dinah Shore shows,'' he says. ``When he talked
about his wife, you just saw the love. And they were real
show-business animals _ everything was about show business. But he
was so devoted to her that Irving wanted Jackie to be as famous as
she wanted to be.
 &HT;    ``You have to admire their guts and determination.''
 &HT;    The story, set in the 1960s and 1970s, includes Susann's
well-publicized feud with Truman Capote, who once said that she
``dressed like a truck driver in drag.''
 &HT;    ``There is a scene where we watch Truman saying these things on
television,'' Lane says. ``And Bette and I throw things at the TV
screen.''
 &HT;    The raucous Midler was a natural to play Susann, the actor adds.
 &HT;    ``She's a ball of fire,'' he says. ``It's a wonderful role for
her _ she gets to be funny and flashy, plus she gets to have a
hospital deathbed scene. And, frankly, what more could any actor
ask for in a movie?''
 &HT;    Lane grew up in Jersey City, N.J., a world away from the glamour
of show business.
 &HT;    ``It was a family where you had to grow up fast,'' he recalls.
``My father was a very self-destructive person. And it was very sad
_ he was an alcoholic who died when I was 11. He essentially drank
himself to death.''
 &HT;    Unpopular and overweight, Lane found a saving grace in his older
brother, Dan, who took him to see plays in New York. Fascinated, at
age 18 Lane moved to New York to pursue his dream of being an
actor.
 &HT;    He lived in a cramped apartment with ``about 10,000 other
struggling actors,'' he jokes. ``Rent was very cheap _ we each paid
$1 a month.''
 &HT;    Lane was working delivering singing telegrams when he got his
first break, a short-lived 1982 television series with Mickey
Rooney, ``One of the Boys.'' The cast also included future stars
Meg Ryan and Dana Carvey.
 &HT;    Although the show bombed, Lane found doors opening, especially
on Broadway. A series of increasingly prominent stage roles led to
his acclaimed star turns in ``Guys and Dolls'' (1992), ``Love!
Valour! Compassion!'' (1994) and ``A Funny Thing Happened on the
Way to the Forum'' (1996).
 &HT;    Along the way, Lane began to be seen in a variety of films _
including, ironically, a bit part in the television movie
``Jacqueline Susann's Valley of the Dolls'' (1981). His most
memorable films include ``Frankie and Johnny'' (1991), ``Addams
Family Values'' (1993) and ``Jeffrey'' (1995).
 &HT;    The small screen, however, has not proven so kind: Lane's recent
television series, ``Encore! Encore!'', was canceled after only a
few episodes.
 &HT;    Back on the big screen, Lane co-stars in Kenneth Branagh's
upcoming ``Love's Labour's Lost,'' a musical version of the
Shakespeare classic that also features Branagh, Matthew Lillard and
Alicia Silverstone.
 &HT;    ``We're singing and dancing and doing the Bard,'' Lane says. ``I
get to sing `There's No Business Like Show Business.' I play the
clown character _ he's a vaudevillian who is down on his luck. He
walks around with this little suitcase of rubber chickens.''
 &HT;    And no, Lane says, there's nothing to the English tabloid rumors
that Branagh and Silverstone dated during filming.
 &HT;    ``We were working seven days a week,'' he says. ``I don't think
either one of them had time for an affair. We were working very
hard.''
 &HT;    Lane's return to Broadway, co-starring with Victor Garber in
Stephen Sondheim's new musical ``Wise Guys,'' was recently derailed
when the production was shut down for retooling. In the meantime,
he's weighing movie offers, including a possible sequel to ``The
Bird Cage,'' which he still regards as his biggest career break.
 &HT;    ``Of course that movie, and last year GQ magazine named me as
one of their Men of the Year,'' he says.
 &HT;    Lane heaves a fake sob.
 &HT;    ``It was very moving to me,'' he says, smiling. ``As you know, I
was the Theater Man of the Year. So you can only imagine what an
ugly battle that was. It was between me and Carol Channing, and
they gave it to me!''
 &HT;    And his prize?
 &HT;    ``I got a free trip to GQ Land, where you can see anorexic
supermodels in their natural habitat,'' Lane says. ``However,
you're not allowed to feed them.''
 &HT;    He's delighted to get a laugh.
 &HT;    ``The best feeling is to make other people laugh,'' he says.
``When I hear laughter, something clicks in my head. I think, `This
is what I really love more than anything else in the world _ just
the feeling of people having a great time.'
 &HT;    ``You really can't ask for more.''

A MATTER OF FAITH: FAITH HILL AND THE POWER OF A SONG

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of country singer Faith Hill.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    The fundamental things may still apply, but a kiss is more than
just a kiss.
 &HT;    Just ask Faith Hill. Her million-selling 1998 hit, ``This
Kiss,'' launched a wave of success that has seen Hill vault from
mere country-music stardom to become the most significant pop-music
crossover this side of Shania Twain.
 &HT;    The song sparked sales of more than 3 million copies of Hill's
third album, ``Faith,'' helped her snare five Academy of Country
Music Awards and earned her a spot alongside Cher, Whitney Houston
and Tina Turner on VH1's ``Divas Live '99.''
 &HT;    Moreover, it provided a springboard for her new album,
``Breathe'' (1999), to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard charts,
selling nearly 250,000 copies in its first week of release.
 &HT;    In other words, the 32-year-old Hill is no longer merely the
wife of country singer Tim McGraw, the mother of their two
daughters and her husband's perennial opening act. She's a star in
her own right.
 &HT;    Despite her meteoric rise, Hill has kept herself grounded
through family life. She takes her daughters, 2-year-old Gracie and
1-year-old Maggie, on the road with her, and brings the family
together whenever she can.
 &HT;    Some singers come to resent the success of their biggest hits,
feeling overshadowed by their own songs, but Hill appreciates
everything ``This Kiss'' has done for her.
 &HT;    ``It just kind of shows the power of a song,'' she says. ``It's
continuing to be played, across the board _ even around the world.
It was a huge record in Germany, South Africa ... just
everywhere.''
 &HT;    Hill recounts a friend's supermarket encounter with a teen-ager
who spotted Hill on the cover of a country magazine.
 &HT;    ``The girl shouts _ `Mom! The ``This Kiss'' girl ... is country!
Did you know that? Do you believe that?''' Hill says, laughing. ``I
thought it was hysterical.''
 &HT;    But beneath Hill's laughter lies the age-old lament of the
artist who resists being pigeonholed.
 &HT;    ``I don't want to be pegged as anything,'' she says. ``I just
want to be respected as an artist that's trying to do great music.
I really don't see any crime in that.''
 &HT;    Some in Nashville do, however. Like mass-audience breakouts
Twain and Garth Brooks before her, Hill has been attacked for
betraying the faith, forsaking her country roots to chase broader
pop success. Critics have slammed her new provocative, skin-baring
image, her Vogue photo sessions and her recent deal to be one of
the faces of Cover Girl cosmetics.
 &HT;    Hill pleads guilty as charged _ except for that part about
betraying the faith.
 &HT;    ``I don't forget where I come from,'' the singer says. ``I'm not
trying to be anybody else. I'm not trying to be Shania, I'm not
trying to be Whitney Houston or anybody else.
 &HT;    ``I have an incredible respect for the establishment of country
music,'' she insists. ``I was inspired by it. It molded and shaped
who I am today _ but so did a lot of other sounds.''
 &HT;    Gospel was the first music that the former Faith Perry, the
adopted daughter of a factory worker and a retired bank employee,
sang while growing up in Star, Miss. Her mother remembers Faith as
a prodigy who belted songs at age 3 and gave her first public
performance at 10, for a women's-club luncheon. Soon she had taught
herself to play guitar and write songs.
 &HT;    After one semester of college, Hill left home in early 1987 to
pursue her star in Nashville. Doors did not open, and she soon
found herself on the very fringes of the industry, working in the
T-shirt booth at the annual Fan Fair festival and then at the
receptionist's desk at a music-publishing company.
 &HT;    Hill, who was married for four years to songwriter Dan Hill,
later landed a job sending out mail-order souvenirs to Reba
McEntire's fans. She auditioned to be one of McEntire's backup
singers, but lost out to Paula Kaye Evans _ who was killed, along
with most of the group, in a 1991 plane crash. Hill, meanwhile,
honed her skills in clubs and was signed by Warner Bros. Records in
1992.
 &HT;    Her first two albums _ ``Take Me as I Am'' (1993) and ``It
Matters to Me'' (1995) _ did well, but didn't reach beyond the
country realm. For ``Faith'' she added a second producer _ Byron
Gallimore, who also worked with McGraw and Jo Dee Messina _ to
handle some tracks along with her longtime collaborator Dan Huff.
 &HT;    ``I realized I didn't have to necessarily record with just one
producer on an album,'' Hill says. ``That opened up this whole
other world of thinking.''
 &HT;    Meshing two producers with different styles proved difficult,
Hill admits, ``but they each brought something that made a great
partnership.''
 &HT;    In the wake of ``Faith's'' success, the team remained intact,
with song selection and recording for what would become ``Breathe''
going on even as Hill staged her first tour as a headliner last
summer.
 &HT;    ``I want to grow on stage as well, so when I go and choose a
song for a record, I think about how it's going to translate to my
fans from the stage,'' she says. ``I tour _ that's part of who I am
right now. I wanted to make an album that was going to be fun to
bring to the road.''
 &HT;    That doesn't mean ``Breathe'' is without tender moments. Hill
recorded Bruce Springsteen's quiet expression of devotion, ``If I
Should Fall Behind,'' while her duet with McGraw on ``Let's Make
Love'' makes married love seem positively sinful.
 &HT;    ``It's a very romantic, very sensual song,'' Hill acknowledges
with a laugh. ``We weren't groping each other or anything like
that, but we certainly meant what we were singing. It was a special
moment for us _ it was nice just being in there together, doing
it.''
 &HT;    Hill plans to hit the road for another tour in support of
``Breathe,'' and she hints that McGraw might join her as a
co-headliner.
 &HT;    If ``Breathe'' sustains the breakthrough she made with
``Faith,'' Hill is entirely aware that the Nashville backlash will
only intensify. But she's prepared for whatever her critics may
dish out.
 &HT;    ``I'm strong,'' she says. ``I just want to do what I do and stay
focused. I don't think they are going to stifle me ... I feel very
comfortable where I am now, and I'm very proud of the record. What
is on that record is just a collection of songs that I really,
really loved and had fun with.
 &HT;    ``I'm just growing and being who I am right now,'' she
concludes. ``That's all I can ever be _ or ever want to be,
really.''

WASHINGTON VICE: TIM MATHESON FINDS A HOME IN `THE WEST WING'

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Tim Matheson in a scene from ``The West
Wing.'') 
 By BRIAN HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be released in Canada before Jan. 23. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan's success notwithstanding, it's not easy for an
actor to make it to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Matheson knows that firsthand. Despite an impressive resume
with more than 100 credits, Matheson had to audition for the role
of Vice President John Hoynes on the new hit political drama, ``The
West Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he says, he didn't mind trying out for the part.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of agents said to me, `You shouldn't have to audition,
they should just hire you,''' he recalls. ``But I said, `These are
the best people in town, and they're not just going to hire
somebody _ they're going to want to see them.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I've got no false pride about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The people in question were ``West Wing'' executive producers
Aaron Sorkin and Thomas Schlamme. Sorkin is the author of ``A Few
Good Men'' (1992) and ``The American President'' (1996), as well as
the creator of ``Sports Night,'' while Schlamme has produced
``Chicago Hope'' and ``Tracey Takes On.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a big fan of all their work, and they were both there,''
Matheson recalls. ``So we played around with the material, and it
just worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   The producers are equally pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were incredibly lucky to get Tim for this role,'' Sorkin
says. ``He actually looks like a vice president, if you know what I
mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Matheson based his vice-presidential portrayal not on current
veep Al Gore, or on recent incumbents such as Dan Quayle or George
Bush. Instead he reached back 35 years to Vice President Lyndon B.
Johnson, later president after the murder of President John F.
Kennedy in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   The often-tense Johnson-Kennedy dynamic _ the two had been
rivals for the Democratic nomination in 1960 _ is reflected in the
strained relationship between Hoynes and President Josiah Bartlett
(Martin Sheen).
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnson was a man of incredible ego and accomplishment,''
Matheson says. ``And he felt he'd been usurped by a younger, less
experienced, more glamorous politician in Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The fictional vice president is younger than his real-life
model. But, like Johnson, Hoynes brings to his office a wealth of
political experience which he feels isn't utilized by the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got his own, strong agenda,'' Matheson says, ``and
perhaps doesn't hide it as much as he should, in light of the fact
that the president treats him shabbily.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent episodes, Bartlett's animosity toward Hoynes has been
attributed to Hoynes' having wavered before accepting Bartlett's
offer of the vice-presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't have made me beg,'' Bartlett said.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from that incident has left the president and his
staff trying to keep the outspoken Hoynes on a short leash.
</P>
<P>
   It's essential to the story line, Sorkin says, that the audience
realize that the vice president is not merely a figurehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president is a major part of the overall presidency,
despite what people think,'' the writer/producer explains. ``A lot
of people in the U.S. think that the veep doesn't really do
anything _ that's not how it works on our show.''
</P>
<P>
   Matheson agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes for good conflict, which in turn makes for good
drama,'' the actor says. ``It's good character development and a
lot of fun to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Matheson can rightfully call himself an authority on
characterization, having played scores of roles in his three
decades in film and television. Best known for ``National Lampoon's
Animal House'' (1978), Matheson actually had a flourishing career
well before then _ in fact, that film came near the halfway point
of his career to date.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, one of his first credits was a guest spot on
a 1962 episode of ``Leave it to Beaver.'' He was 15 _ though he
managed to escape the various hazards that have tripped up numerous
other former child actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky not being on a huge hit show or being a kid star
like Gary Coleman or so many others,'' he says, ``because they face
a huge burden overcoming the identities they've created.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as Matheson is concerned, there are only two choices for
a child actor once he or she hits the teen-age years: get out of
the business or make the transition to adult actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smart ones, like Jodie Foster and Kurt Russell, who were
both stars, both quit for a while,'' he says. ``Whereas with me, I
hit my lean years and made the transition by doing more voice work
offscreen.''
</P>
<P>
   As his teen years passed, Matheson dutifully went to school
before moving on to the big screen and films such as ``Divorce,
American Style'' (1967) with Dick Van Dyke and ``Yours, Mine and
Ours'' (1968) with Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball.
</P>
<P>
   His career continued during the 1970s with regular work on
dramatic series such as ``Bonanza,'' ``The Quest'' and ``How the
West Was Won.'' Then came ``Animal House,'' a film he recalls as a
welcome change of pace.
</P>
<P>
   Bored with being typecast as the nice guy next door, he adds, he
``wanted to break out. Before `Animal House' I'd never done
comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, ``Animal House'' led Matheson to more comedy
roles during the 1980s, including the lighthearted series
``Tucker's Witch'' (1982-1983), as well as the feature films ``Up
the Creek'' (1984) and ``Fletch'' (1985).
</P>
<P>
   But while most of the scripts he was offered were comedies,
Matheson strove to maintain balance, to escape being pigeonholed as
either a comedian or strictly a dramatic actor. He also took on
regular stage work, to be sure that he didn't evolve into purely a
movie or television actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything an actor can do to broaden his range is a valuable
tool and will lead to longevity,'' he says. ``I try to keep growing
and learning and changing because, really, it gets boring
otherwise. Even the audience gets bored.''
</P>
<P>
   Range is all very well, but it surely doesn't hurt that the
53-year-old father of three has remained remarkably youthful, a
fact he attributes more to genetics and makeup than to anything
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, if you have a really good cameraman, you can look
younger longer,'' Matheson adds.
</P>
<P>
   To judge by its ratings, ``The West Wing'' is in for a long run,
which means Vice President Hoynes will be around for a while _
which suits Matheson fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working on `West Wing' has been incredibly rewarding,'' he
says, ``because it's an adult show with bright, intelligent,
literate dialogue and multifaceted characters ... which you just
don't find on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, for that matter, very often in Washington.

HOW AMERICANS LAUNCHED A NAVY

MILLIONS FOR DEFENSE 
The Subscription Warships of 1798 
By Frederick C. Leiner 
Naval Institute Press, 262 pp., illustrated, $36.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On April 3, 1798, President John Adams sent to Congress
documents detailing the efforts of three French officials to extort
a ``loan'' of 1 million pounds and a bribe of another 50,000 pounds
to secure American merchant ships from seizure by French
privateers.
</P>
<P>
   The incident became known as ``The XYZ Affair'' for the coded
names of the three French officials involved in the shakedown
attempt, and it gave birth to the slogan ``Millions for defense,
but not a penny for tribute.'' It also moved Congress, on June 30,
to authorize President Adams to accept ``any armed vessels . . .
offered to him for the use of the United States, to be employed in
public service.''
</P>
<P>
   The dates are significant, as Frederick C. Leiner notes in his
first-rate account of a little-known chapter in American naval
history, because of what happened during the two months between
them.
</P>
<P>
   In ports up and down the coast, local merchants and ship owners
were already subscribing money to build such ``armed vessels.''
Newburyport _ whose merchant fleet had been particularly ravaged by
privateers _ would be laying the keel for the 20-gun Merrimack on
July 9, barely 10 days after the Senate passed the authorization
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, writes Leiner, a Philadelphia lawyer and naval
historian, the public's ``support for strong measures of defense
outpaced the government,'' not only in subscribing money to build a
navy, but in refurbishing coastal defenses and mustering the old
militia companies. And, as the events in Newburyport suggest, doing
so with patriotic enthusiasm _ with only a slender hope of
profiting from the 6 percent interest on the net cost of the ship
to be paid ``at the convenience of the government.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Merrimack was launched on Oct. 12, Leiner writes, ``the
town celebrated with a `Music on Launching Day' concert, in which a
company of Boston musicians introduced a new piece, `The New
Federal Song _ Hail Patriots All.' After the concert, well-heeled
Newburyporters gavotted at a ball.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, 10 locally subscribed ships were built, in Newburyport,
Salem, Boston, Providence, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore,
Charleston, and a group of Virginia towns. At sea, they joined the
three government-built frigates, Constitution, Constellation, and
United States.
</P>
<P>
   None of the subscription ships long survived the ``Quasi War''
with France: They fell victim to the Jefferson administration's
military cutbacks. But several, principally the Essex and the
Boston, took part in major naval engagements, with most of their
assignments involving convoy duty in the Caribbean, where the
French maintained a large fleet. Leiner writes with obvious
enthusiasm about the fighting at sea _ his account of the Boston's
victory over the French navy corvette Le Berceau off Guadeloupe
could have come right out of C. S. Forester's ``The Captain from
Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is right to have focused on the on-shore fund-raising
activities, for that is what makes the story of these vessels so
unusual. When ``the subscription frenzy swept into Boston,'' Leiner
writes, 34 merchants met in an office on State Street on June 27
and immediately pledged $75,000. When the pledges reached $115,250
two days later, the Columbian Centinel boasted that ``Boston will
outdo every city in the union in this demonstration of federal
patriotism.'' In all, 103 merchants and civic leaders pledged
$136,000, with William Phillips (later a lieutenant governor and
president of Massachusetts General Hospital) pledging $10,000 _ the
largest individual gift in the entire country.
</P>
<P>
   Of almost equal interest is the technological enterprise that
was sparked. In the building of the Boston, Leiner writes, Paul
Revere discovered a method of melting down scrap copper and
reworking it into bolts and spikes. And that, Leiner writes, led in
turn to Revere's opening of the nation's first copper-rolling mill
to make sheathing for the hulls of American naval vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the patriotic merchants, the hero of these events is John
Adams. He correctly gauged the public reaction to the French
attacks on American shipping _ and their attempt to use those
attacks as the basis for extortion. And having once set the
military reaction in motion, he took a personal interest in seeing
it carried out, inviting the captain of the Merrimack to dinner at
his home in Braintree, attending the launching of the Boston, and
playing a role in choosing its officers.
</P>
<P>
   Leiner properly gives Adams the last word: The subscription
ships, he told a joint session of Congress on November 22, 1800,
``called suddenly unto existence by a great national exigency,
(have) raised us in our own esteem.''

&HT;     THE DOT-COM FOUNTATION OF YOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ You know you're getting old when ... fill in the
blank. If you forget what you were going to fill in, well, never
mind.
</P>
<P>
   I had a birthday on Jan. 10, and let's just say I turned the age
President Clinton will be when he leaves the White House. But
that's not so bad, because he spent at least a year acting like an
18-year-old in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   It's all relative, and you can be as old or young as you want to
be.
</P>
<P>
   That's what a smash-hit Web site called RealAge.com teaches you,
while simultaneously selling vitamins and a personalized ``age
reduction'' plan.
</P>
<P>
   You know you're getting old when you call up RealAge.com and
take the on-line test that compares your chronological age with
your ``real age.''
</P>
<P>
   As you type in ``no'' to whether you eat five or more servings
of fruit or vegetables a day, you can watch a little dial show your
``real age'' increase.
</P>
<P>
   Who even knows what a serving of fruit is?
</P>
<P>
   I didn't lie on the test, and still my ``real age'' came out 1.8
years younger than Bill Clinton will be when he leaves the White
House. I don't mean 19.2.
</P>
<P>
   The RealAge test is easy on the system. That's good because
stress increases your ``real age.'' You don't feel shamed into
lying. Men only have to admit to drinking two or more alcoholic
drinks per day and women only have to admit to one or more.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows why women are cheated out of a drink. Neither amount
of alcohol seems like much of a consolation for old age. And
nowadays it seems binge drinking is a sign of youth.
</P>
<P>
   I think what you drink is a more important sign of age.
</P>
<P>
   Trust anyone who drinks a cosmopolitan to be under 30.
</P>
<P>
   Another question asked whether I used seat belts all the time
and had airbags in my car.
</P>
<P>
   The site later told me that if I took those precautions I could
reduce my ``real age'' 3.4 years.
</P>
<P>
   But wait a minute. It's mainly teen-agers who are ejected from
cars because they aren't wearing seat belts, so shouldn't you be
younger if you don't buckle up? And those teen-agers remain forever
young.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Roizen designed the RealAge test based on life
expectancy data from 25,000 medical studies, not how young we
really feel or act. Roizen is 53 chronological years old and claims
to be 38 in ``real age,'' according to his own test.
</P>
<P>
   But then, I'd be feeling pretty young if I had a Web site and
book recommended by an Apple.com review and, better than that,
Oprah Winfrey, who came out pretty young herself on the test.
</P>
<P>
   Wealth, for everyone but Steve Forbes, is the best age reduction
plan. It can give you health and a heck of a makeover.
</P>
<P>
   The RealAge test probably should just ask what your income is _
the higher it is the more years it takes off. Instead the test asks
if we have high blood pressure, eat tomato products, get depressed
and have a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   That's not funny. Even Sen. Strom Thurmond, ``real age'' 296, is
going to say yes and get some years taken off because some study
somewhere says a sense of humor keeps you young.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to know someone's real age, ask them if they find
``South Park'' funny. I only know a few people over the
chronological age of 50 who do, and I'm not admitting who we are.
</P>
<P>
   The RealAge test also asks how fast you drive over the speed
limit, with alternatives ranging from 4 mph over the limit to 15 or
more mph over the limit.
</P>
<P>
   Your ``real age'' on the test declines with your speed, even
though in real life the slower you go the older you are.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to know how young people really are, and not just
their life expectancy, I wouldn't ask what vitamins they take.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a lot of vitamins is a sure sign of wanting to live
forever, which in turn is a sure sign of not being young anymore.
The young assume they're going to live forever. That's why they
drive fast and binge drink.
</P>
<P>
   If I were designing a ``real age'' test, I certainly wouldn't
ask if people get 90 minutes of sustained exercise a week and say
that walking counts, the way the folks at RealAge did.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety minutes of sustained skateboarding means you're young,
not walking. Only people like me, with 100-year-old knees, consider
walking exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with being human is that we age awfully unevenly.
And the most complex part of us, the brain, ages more unevenly than
all the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the skull of one 54-year-old man can reside the knowledge
and charm of a 70-year-old, the ambition of a 30-year-old, the
responsibility of an 8-year-old and the appetite of a 16-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Mr. President, one encouraging age-reduction tip on
the RealAge Web site was that you can lower your ``real age'' 1.6
years by means of regular sex _ ``within the context of a
monogamous relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Or you can just buckle up, drive slowly and try to have a sense
of humor about things.

 &HT;    Search engines: Underpowered, oil-leaking
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ We wanted to come up with lots of reasons why
the creation of the Internet search engine has made our lives
simpler, more efficient and easier to pursue as we look for help
navigating the Web. But after looking for evidence on the Net and
getting back search results like ``Hot Blondes want to talk to YOU
_ XXX!'' and links to personal home pages for engineers in
Istanbul, we reversed our position.
</P>
<P>
   A study released last year by the NEC Research Institute in
Princeton, N.J., found even the largest search engines only cover
about one-sixth of what's on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And we would argue that it's not even the correct one-sixth.
</P>
<P>
   What caused such a mess? Much like the Titanic, it was the
result of hubris: While a few search engines, such as Yahoo!, use
humans to catalog Web sites into the correct categories and
indexes, most sites tried to do the same by creating ``smart''
software that did it autlly. The result? Thousands of
irrelevant results on the simplest of requests.
</P>
<P>
   So, all you incompetent, frustrating search engines out there _
we have one last search request for you: ``Get bent.''

 &HT;    Looking for a loan? Shop online and save
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They don't have to give you credit, but there are
plenty of people out there in cyberspace who would be delighted to
do just that. Whether you're looking for a house loan or a car
loan, there are online lenders in just that business.
</P>
<P>
   And there are other sites and services online that specialize in
helping you decide whether you can qualify for a loan and, if you
can, that will help you calculate just how much you can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with a common scenario: You own a home, have a
mortgage but wonder if you're getting a good deal. Is now a good
time to refinance? Yahoo _ which has several impressive loan
services _ has just the tool you need at loan.yahoo.com/m/mm.html.
When you go to that page, you'll fill out a fairly lengthy form
answering questions including what interest you're paying, where
you live, the value of the property, the type of property
(single-family home, condo, etc.) and the remaining balance on your
loan.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just push the button. You'll be told if the program can
find other deals that beat the one you have now.
</P>
<P>
   Before we leave the Yahoo loan center, let's take a look at one
more service at www.giggocar.com/yahoo/affordability.asp. It does
the calculations that will help you decide just how much you can
afford to pay for a car. While you may not like the answers, it's a
good starting point for making a buying decision.
</P>
<P>
   Now we'll look at some auto loan sites _ places online that will
lend you money to buy a car. Before we do, remember that this is
not an endorsement of the sites or an assurance you will get a good
deal. Just as you would before obtaining any loan, you need to
compare rates and also assure yourself that the company is a good
one to do business with.
</P>
<P>
   The first site at www.world-funding
</P>
<P>
   -group.com/ tries to give that assurance with a big sticker from
the Better Business Bureau. There's also a toll-free number to
call. The site has loan calculators that will give you a good idea
what sort of payments you would make before applying.
</P>
<P>
   Since most of these sites offer the same services, let's just
list one other auto loan page. You'll find PeopleFirstFinance at
www.peoplefirst.com/pff/sitewhoweare
</P>
<P>
   .cfm. It's been in business since 1997, which _ in the online
world _ is a long stand.
</P>
<P>
   Our next site is called Loan Locator.Com. The premise here is
that you select the type of loan you're interested in (auto, home,
etc.) and then fill out a form. Once that is complete, you're told
that you'll receive at least four e-mails offering you a loan.
Again, let the buyer beware. The site is located at
popwords.com/locator/mortgage
</P>
<P>
   /Arkansas.mortgage.lead
</P>
<P>
   /bad-credit-mortgage.asp.
</P>
<P>
   A similar site _ which specializes in mortgages _ is called
GetSmart.Com and is located at www.getsmart.com/mortgage
</P>
<P>
   /HomeBanner?BANNERNAME &QC; 0.
</P>
<P>
   At Atlanta-based Real Estate.Com, the notion of shopping a loan
is taken to a new level. Simply go to www.realestate.com
</P>
<P>
   /mortgageauction/home.asp and fill out the form. Your mortgage
application is submitted automatically to more than 250 potential
lenders. You're promised that you'll start getting bids competing
for your business in 24 hours or so.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Lending Tree, an online outfit that advertises
you'll ``apply in minutes _ know within hours.'' It's located at
homepages.go.com/homepages/v/i/e
</P>
<P>
   /viewcosmic/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget, by the way, that more conventional lenders also
have Web sites. So, while searching for an online loan, check out
the Web site maintained by your bank or mortgage lenders in your
area.

 &HT;    Late to the game, Apple adds series of Net-based services
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Apple announced a dizzying number of new initiatives
at the recent MacWorld Expo in San Francisco. It's no wonder some
got lost in the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at one in particular that, although it received
little attention, is very important to Apple.
</P>
<P>
   This initiative is called iTools, and it's an effort to raise
Apple's profile and usefulness on the Internet. In essence, iTools
is a collection of six free Internet-based consumer services.
</P>
<P>
   The services include electronic mail, a database of ``kid-safe''
Web sites, file storage, and space to build and maintain a Web
page.
</P>
<P>
   None of these services is unique. If anything, Apple is late to
the game in offering them. Many other sites, including Microsoft's,
are offering all or more of these services.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, though, Apple can distinguish itself by how well it
executes Internet-based services. At first glance they certainly
look classy.
</P>
<P>
   There's one caveat when it comes to using them right away. A
user must have Apple's latest operating system, OS 9. Other
operating systems won't work.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find iTools as a tab on Apple's redesigned Web page. The
new design features a platinum look similar to that of the
company's operating system. Along the top of the page is a series
of tabs. Click on the one named iTools, and you'll go to a page
that briefly describes each of the four services and asks you to
register in order to use any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in brief, is a description of each of the new services:
</P>
<P>
   _ Mac.com: You can now send and receive e-mail through Apple's
Web site. It works pretty much like the other such services on the
Net.
</P>
<P>
   _ KidSafe: Apple has built a database of 55,000 sites it has
tested for appropriateness for kids. Signing onto KidSafe blocks
you from going to any other sites. It works in the reverse manner

 &HT;    Merger fallout uncertain
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the past week, all the pundits and analysts have
been busy trying to figure out how the AOL-Time Warner merger will
change our lives, raise our cable rates, increase the hole in the
ozone or help the Cubs win the pennant.
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to talk about the potential of this new
enterprise and the role TV/Internet guru Bob Pittman, AOL's
president, could have on the digital music revolution as well as
broadband content development, but the results of the deal remain
to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   So instead, I'd like to ``take a moment'' as they say on ``Ally
McBeal'' and remember that AOL and Time Warner have been
insinuating themselves into our lives long before Steve Case, Ted
Turner and Gerald Levin were all smiling and clapping in front of
the scariest pile of media logos ever collected in one place.
</P>
<P>
   When I finished college, I went to work for Little, Brown &AMP;
Co.'s college textbook division. It was fun for a while, but I soon
discovered all the disparaging things GenX author Jay McInerney
said about low-level publishing jobs were true, and I decided to
move on. I resigned on Monday, and on Wednesday employees were told
that the company would merge with motion picture giant Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction at the staid Boston publishing house was one of
sheer horror. Editors were stuffing their resumes into fax machines
faster than you could say ``Bugs Bunny.'' The very idea that the
company founded by Henry Luce, which published such venerable
magazines as Time and Life and had such noted talents as Norman
Mailer, Ellen Gilchrist and Ansel Adams, was going to join up with
a movie studio was just appalling.
</P>
<P>
   My boss, a wonderful editor named Alex, just shook his head and
murmured, ``The writing was right there on the wall, and I wasn't
wearing my glasses.'' The new Time Warner divested its textbook
division and a few other moldy properties and continued its march
toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   I moved to New York City about the time America Online was
gaining mainstream popularity. It was also the subject of much
ridicule for its ``carpet bombing'' marketing technique for
packaging AOL diskettes in everything except cans of Campbell's
soup.
</P>
<P>
   My boss had a box of AOL diskettes under his desk, which he
collected from all over the place. It was a great curiosity, and
people loved to look at all the versions and types and colors of
AOL disks that were actually in circulation. Marc was devastated
when the janitorial staff mistook his collection for trash. I
suspect ``Antiques Road Show'' would probably be interested in that
box now.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, people liked AOL, even the Web geeks who usually
had another Internet provider to get them out to the Web. (AOL
hadn't done any of its famous deals with Netscape or Microsoft
yet.) Every month founder Steve Case would write a letter to
members that would be featured prominently on the AOL welcome
screen, and people read them.
</P>
<P>
   They talked about ``Steve'' like they knew him. The service had
only 4 million or 5 million members then. People were known to have
actual conversations online without being accosted by potential
child molesters, credit card thieves or rowdy teens with stupid
screen names.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, AOL went to a flat-rate pricing plan that was
novel in the industry. The crush of subscribers who logged on for
hours on end just because they could nearly brought the system to
its knees. People were livid. They were doing everything from
circulating online petitions to e-mailing Steve Case personally to
complain.
</P>
<P>
   You see, back in 1997, millions of people thought they could
just drop a note to Steve, and that he might read it and actually
do something. Usually what you got back was a form letter, but
still it was something.
</P>
<P>
   AOL had the knack of making millions of people all feel like
part of one big happy but slightly dysfunctional family. I actually
know several couples who met on AOL and not in a romance chat room,
either. A group of people used to meet every Sunday night to talk
about alternative rock music, and I never missed a week.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times also sponsored a moderated book chat that was
one of the best book groups I've ever dropped in on. AOL connected
people, almost in the same way the pictures from the old Life
magazine used to, which is one reason all the pundits say this
merger makes so much sense.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually AOL's troubles led Case to television to convince
users that the dial-up debacle would never happen ever, ever again.
Nevertheless, he threw the door wide open for upstarts like
MindSpring, EarthLink, AT&AMP;T's WorldNet and a host of other Internet
service providers to offer Net access without endless busy signals
and mail server crashes and with customer service people who might
actually help you.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow, people stayed loyal to AOL. The service continued
to grow and develop into something that not just first-time Net
users but seasoned and cynical veterans might like, with
innovations in Web access, electronic commerce and instant
messaging across the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at the start of the 21st century, AOL, the online service
I've been using since I got my first PC, is merging with Time
Warner, the company I was working for when I got my first PC. AOL
Time Warner has grown from being a print publisher to a movie,
cable, news, sports, music and now Internet provider.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too big? Who knows? Probably, but I still remember when
people thought that Time magazine and Warner music and CNN all
being owned by the same company was unthinkable. I wonder how much
they'll want for a piece of Microsoft?

 &HT;    Cutting edge gadgets for 2000
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News ServiceThe first Consumer Electronics Show of
<TEXT>
the third millennium was held last week in Las Vegas. The
conference shows off the cool gadgets and gizmos you'll be seeing
this year and beyond. Gadgetry is in hyperdrive, with some 7,000
new products on the way. Here are the best of the best, the cutting
edge of the cutting edge due out this year. A cautionary note: The
products' release dates and prices are tentative and, at the time
of electronics show, could not be confirmed. That means not
everything is guaranteed to hit store shelves. Some gadgets may be
destined to only exist on the shelves of their creators:
<P>
   GENIUS CALLING
</P>
<P>
   Who: Ericsson, www.ericsson.com
</P>
<P>
   What: R380 Smart Phone. The Smart Phone is the size of an
average mobile phone but has a flip keypad which transforms the
communication device into a palm-sized computer. The phone is
totally jammed with features including Internet capability and PDA.
The R380 will feature a calendar, address software, WAP browser
(which enables you to see Web pages without the graphics) and
handwriting recognition software. The phone is also voice-activated
for the hands-free executive in you. Oh, and if that's not enough,
the R380 can also be an MP3 music player.
</P>
<P>
   When: Tentatively June/July (in limited areas)
</P>
<P>
   How much: to be announced
</P>
<P>
   STRAIGHT SHOOTER

   Who: JVC, www.jvc.com
</P>
<P>
   What: GR-DVL9800. This is the top-of-the-line JVC digital video
camera to be released this year. The camera has been reduced in
size and now is about the size of your hand. The optics have been
totally overhauled and the camera lightened. It will double as a
true digital camera. While other digital video cameras capture
images off the tape, the JVC captures high resolution XGA digital
stills on a separate, removable MultimediaCard. This will let the
user film and photograph simultaneously. The camera comes with an
automatic pop-up flash.
</P>
<P>
   When: February
</P>

   What: Soundspot SA-2. This 4.5-inch speaker won a CES
``Innovations'' award for its design and superior sound. The tiny
orb speaker was developed to be integrated into home theaters.
While its physical profile is almost nonexistent, the sound is
fantastic. This is due to Morel's own, super-secret audio
technology, cryptically called EVC (external voice coil). The
result: speakers that would make any audiophile rapturous.
</P>
<P>
   When: March
</P>
<P>
   How much: $530 a pair
</P>
<P>
   LI'L BUDDY

Robot. Using telephony technology, this cordless unit delivers
customized call answering, up to 20 individualized voice mail
boxes, memo recording and conference calls. But that's just the
beginning. Cybergenie can also access your E-mail and faxes and
read them to you over the phone. As a bonus, the Cybergenie can
call you whenever a voice mail, E-mail or fax comes in and read it
to you. The system is especially designed with the small office and
the home office users in mind.
</P>
<P>
   When: End of this month
</P>
<P>
   How much: $500 (one cordless handset is included), $130 each for
additional handsets.
</P>
<P>
   PLAY BOY

capabilities. The unit _ which is the width of two pens lying
side-by-side, a little taller than a cigarette pack and weighs 2.5
ounces _ is packaged with a 64-megabyte removable Memorystick card
(Sony's proprietary memory device). The Memorystick Walkman will
enable you to download an hour's worth of music in just over three
minutes and is USB compatible.
</P>
<P>
   When: February
</P>
<P>
   How much: Expected retail price around $400
</P>
<P>

navigation input. The mechanics are smooth and the screen releases
at the touch of a button. The multimedia station also features
Alpine's Versatile-Link technology for the easy hookup of portable
MP3 players and video game systems.
</P>
<P>
   When: March
</P>
<P>
   How much: To be announced.

 &HT;    Take care of calls with CyberGenie
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ One of the things that separates big companies
from little companies is that big companies often have assistants
to answer calls and forward messages.
</P>
<P>
   Now Cygnion Corp. has introduced a device that turns the small
business owner's personal computer into a personal assistant.
</P>
<P>
   The CyberGenie PC Cordless Phone System directs incoming calls
to as many as 20 different users, forwards calls to outside phones
and notifies users when e-mails and faxes have arrived. And instead
of forcing callers to push buttons, the CyberGenie recognizes
spoken commands.
</P>
<P>
   CyberGenie won an Innovation Award as one of the best new
devices exhibited at the International Consumer Electronics Show in
Las Vegas earlier this month. It is scheduled to start arriving in
CompUSA, Office Depot and other stores by February.
</P>
<P>
   The basic CyberGenie system will sell for $499 and comes with a
2.4GHz digital spread spectrum base station, one cordless handset
and a software disk. It connects to a personal computer through a
USB port and connects to the phone system through standard phone
jacks.
</P>
<P>
   CyberGenie is designed to work in homes and small businesses
with two incoming phone lines. Users can buy up to nine extra
cordless handset and charger units for $129 each.
</P>
<P>
   The system can set up 20 voice mail boxes, and callers reach
their parties simply by speaking their names or dialing their
extensions.
</P>
<P>
   CyberGenie gives its users remote access to e-mail messages and
faxes. The users call into the system, and CyberGenie uses voice
simulation software to read e-mail and faxes over the phone. The
system also offers other phone system features such as conference
calls and calls between handsets within the office.
</P>
<P>
   For additional information on CyberGenie you can visit
www.cygnion.com online or call (877) 438-4364 (GET-GENIE).

 &HT;    Virus-fighting techniques detailed
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the world of computers, there's a never-ending
struggle against viruses, especially if you own a PC.
</P>
<P>
   Learn new ways to squash those bugs in the February issue of PC
World. The magazine offers 75 techniques to deal with viruses.
There are also reviews of the best anti-virus software as well as
Web sites that offer fixes.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to keep up with the jargon generated by computing. Now
there's a helpful and humorous guide. ``Computing'' is a book that
advertises itself as a dictionary for Web surfers, desktop
publishers and numbers crunchers.
</P>
<P>
   The book, written by Henry Beard and Roy McKie, is playfully
done with lots of funny cartoons. Published by Workman Publishing,
it retails for $7.95.
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   First there was the magazine, detailing the armaments of war.
Now there's the software. Electronic Arts has released a computer
CD based on the information generated by Jane's military magazine.
The CD, called ``Jane's Combat Simulations,'' features realistic
simulations of the F/A-18 naval jet fighter. The game is available
only for PCs with Windows 95 or higher. The suggested retail price
is $39.99.
</P>
<P>
   There's a new computer program to help young children learn to
read. ``JumpStart Phonics Learning System,'' published by Knowledge
Adventure, is designed for kids ages 3-8. It offers a multimedia
approach to learning, combining sounds, pictures and text.
``JumpStart Phonics'' is available for both Macs and PCs. It
retails for between $60 and $70.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   Don't be fooled by the name. The Susan Love Web site is not
about sex or romantic love, except in terms of health. This site
offers a wealth of credible information about health issues
concerning middle-aged women. You'll find information about breast
cancer, menopause and yeast infections, among many other topics.
You'll find this site at www.susanlovemd.com.

 &HT;    Compton's strong on basics, but hits a few wrong notes
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Compton's Encyclopedia 2000 is a handsome production,
easily navigated and full of information. Not all of it is good
information, but that is true of most encyclopedias.
</P>
<P>
   Every electronic encyclopedia I've examined, and that includes
virtually all of them, has its weak points and strong points. Like
most of them, Compton's is aimed at the elementary and secondary
school student.
</P>
<P>
   More attention is paid to things these students are apt to need
than to more arcane matters. I usually check on the treatment of a
lot of arcane stuff, and I'm usually disappointed. That situation
continues with Compton's.
</P>
<P>
   Flamenco receives its usual treatment _ that which you might
expect from a modern dance scholar who has barely heard of the
stuff. There is, however, a few seconds of flamenco guitar audio.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the articles are unsigned, and thus there is no one to
blame for this sentence in the article on shooting: ``The early
marksmen on the frontier, however, competed only with rifles
because they believed that accurate shooting with pistols and
revolvers required little or no skill.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the clueless would believe such a thing, and frontier
marksmen may have been unwashed, unkempt and even unlettered, but
as a class they were scarcely clueless.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, absent this blunder, the section on
marksmanship is surprisingly long, detailed, interesting and
lacking in political innuendo.
</P>
<P>
   Every encyclopedia has a time line, but I particularly enjoyed
Compton's. It is easy to browse, can be set up in different blocks
_ years, centuries and so forth _ and is quite detailed.
</P>
<P>
   The audio portions of the encyclopedia are the most amazingly
mixed bag I've encountered yet. On the good side, there's a lot of
it. Some of it is authentic. For instance, the little portion of
Dvorak's symphony ``From the New World'' is played by an orchestra
and not a synthesizer or MIDI instrument. The caption announced
that ``you can hear the music of the black American slaves on this
segment.''
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, you can't. This is the opening of the
symphony, not the ``Going Home'' portion that some argue was
inspired by spirituals.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart's ``Eine Kleine Nachtmusik'' gets orchestral treatment,
but I can't figure out what's happening in the opening theme of the
``Jupiter'' symphony; it sounds dimly like an orchestra, but
there's a piano in it. The famous ``Queen of the Night'' aria from
``Magic Flute,'' we are told, has ``some of the highest notes ever
written for soprano.'' It's a good thing for the kids that this is
pointed out, since there's no soprano to be heard. In fact, the
human voice is notably missing from all the music.
</P>
<P>
   I thought I was reasonably familiar with the work of Beethoven,
but here we are presented with something called ``Nature,'' without
opus number, played by a piano and what might be a hurdy-gurdy or
an abused cat. It is a marchlike affair, and if Beethoven wrote it
I doubt he would thank Compton's for resurrecting it.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pity that music is treated by most of the encyclopedias
in such a cavalier way, as it is one of the most important
advantages the electronic versions have over print.
</P>
<P>
   However, all this carping seems excessive when, according to the
publisher's Web site at www.shopmattel
</P>
<P>
   .com/, this two-disc encyclopedia can be ordered for $15.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of hundred movies and animations, including
some of those dandy 360-degree rotating scenes. One of them,
startlingly, is of the High Museum in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   For the intended audience of schoolchildren intent on subjects
like geography, science, social studies, history and the like,
there is more than enough here to see them through. Compton's seems
particularly strong on modern history, and there are several
thousand links to further information on the Web.

 &HT;    Digital age mega-mergers create settlers, not pioneers
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There is a little shop in Gwinnett County that sells
ice cream that is truly homemade. Unlike the big-name chain ice
cream shops, it doesn't have 84 flavors, it's not fancy and the
prices are relatively high.
</P>
<P>
   But there is always a big line to buy the ice cream. That line
is filled with people who don't mind driving a little farther and
paying a little more for a small selection of really exceptional
ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the announcement that AOL and Time Warner will
merge _ creating a chain store of media unlike any that exists now
_ the experts are predicting with the solemn voice of prophets that
this is the dawn of a new digital age with new rules. You are being
told that the giant new company is the pioneer of the new digital
age.
</P>
<P>
   The experts are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   I think they need to calm down and buy a bowl of homemade peach
ice cream at that down-home little stand.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot to learn from ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Let me give you my own peach-flavored prediction of the future.
Keep in mind that it comes from a fellow who is only expert at ice
cream and typing.
</P>
<P>
   I think the combination is just one more enormous merger. That,
rather than breaking the mold, it is merely a part of a pattern
that should look familiar to you by now.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the merger means to you as a customer: You'll be
able to decide if you want to patronize a new chain of stores. This
chain will sell information. It'll do it efficiently, and there
will be a sameness and a consistency that will appeal to a lot of
people. Like any chain operation, the prices will be good, the
selection of information will be large, and _ as Holiday Inn once
promised in its ads _ you'll find very few surprises.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing in the world wrong with finding that
attractive. A lot of people will. That's the whole notion of the
deal _ big numbers of customers that will turn into big advertising
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will have great power because it is big. So it
will be able to make good deals when it buys and sells. It'll hire
smart and safe people to run the operation. They'll be the managers
of the chain of media stores and will make sure that the stock in
trade _ price, consistency and efficiency _ is maintained.
</P>
<P>
   There will be disadvantages, too. The company will be so big
that it'll react slower than the small companies. That's an
important disadvantage since the rules of the Internet change so
fast. By the time a giant company stops to hold board meetings and
hire marketing consultants to figure out how to cash in on these
changes, it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being the pioneer, the giant will follow paths blazed
by the explorers of the media world. That isn't such a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   But it means that the AOL and Time Warner merger won't create an
innovator in the new digital age. Instead, the new company is more
like the settlers who followed the pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Some customers _ most of them really _ will prefer that. Other
customers, a smaller group, will want things the big company can't
offer, so they'll search out the small media stands that aren't
part of a chain.
</P>
<P>
   Those very attributes of size, consistency and safety inherent
in the big company will open new niches for smart small companies
that are able to move faster and take more chances. The best of
these small companies will realize that they won't be able to
compete with chain store rules. So they will ignore the rules.
They'll concentrate on making the best bowl of homemade peach ice
cream possible, and they'll charge enough for it to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   There will always be advantages for the big companies. And _
thank God a mercy _ there will always be a market for really good
homemade peach ice cream.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: I will be lost without my little metal
watch-band calendars (thin metal strips with a monthly calendar
printed on them). I look for the date more than the time on my
watch! I used to get them as promotional gifts from suppliers, then
found them in Christmas catalogs such as Miles Kimball. M-K didn't
show them this year. Can you help? _ E.F. Merrill
</P>
<P>
   A: I do not know why these are so hard to find, but I have two
sources. Pick up a metallic and gold tone reversible calendar,
12-month set ($5.55 plus shipping) for 2000 from Jackson Office
Supply, 3680 Kinsman Blvd., Madison, WI 53704, or by calling (608)
284-0082. Sets ($5 each, three for $13.50, including shipping) also
are available until Feb. 1 from Gifts to Go, P.O. Box 55607,
Riverside, CA 92517. Q: What can you use to safely remove tree sap
from your car without ruining the paint job? _ Peggy P.
</P>
<P>
   A: Splattered bugs and bird droppings are more toxic to your
car's paint than tree sap. Older paint not well-protected by
regular waxings is more susceptible to damage. Vernon Warren of
Warren's Auto Detail uses WashThinner (pick some up at Auto Zone)
if the sap is a few weeks old. He follows with a hand wax. Ronnie
Herzog at Advanced Mobile Detail carefully scrapes hardened sap
with his fingernail and follows this with a complete wax using
McQuairs Cleaner and Wax. McQuairs eliminates any little marks left
by fingernails. Q: What is the travel range (outdoors) of a pet boa
constrictor in an urban environment? Signs went up in our
neighborhood asking to help locate a 7-foot-long snake that escaped
about two blocks away. I can go into my thoughts later about the
boneheadedness of keeping a reptile that size in an apartment (or
anywhere else). I'm concerned about looking out my door and seeing
it wrapped around my geraniums or, worse, my toddler. Could you ask
your experts if my nervousness about a loose creature is
reasonable? Are there precautions to avoid a surprise visit? I'm an
animal lover, but I draw the line at something that can squeeze the
life out of a 3-year-old child.
</P>
<P>
   _ J.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: Boa constrictors are generally non-aggressive snakes,
according to the folks at Zoo Keeper, an exotic pet shop. These
snakes do not attack unless repeatedly bothered. Reptiles are
cold-blooded, so cool weather makes them lethargic (read S L O W).
Two blocks is a long way to travel under these conditions. The boa
is probably looking for a warm spot _ next to an outdoor heater or
car engine. There is no effective way to look for the missing
snake. A 7-foot snake could possibly attack a toddler. But little
tykes are never left unattended.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many months did the ex-Miss America Vanessa Williams
reign before she resigned? Three? _ O.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Nope, 10 months. Vanessa Williams was crowned Miss America on
Sept. 17, 1983. Winner of both the swimsuit and talent contests,
she made history as the first African-American Miss America. After
the publication of her controversial photos in Penthouse magazine,
Williams resigned on July 23, 1984. Williams was replaced by New
Jersey's Suzette Charles. Q: My mother and I have been looking for
a dress for her to wear at my wedding. We found a fabulous
off-white dress. I have seen many mothers wearing white or cream in
magazines. My dress is ivory but not identical to the color we
chose for my mother. I do not care if she wears it, but I don't
want her to feel uncomfortable because a few whisper, ``She
shouldn't be wearing that color.'' _ B. B.
</P>
<P>
   A: It is your day. What you say goes _ attire for the mother of
the bride or groom, flower girls, etc. With more bridesmaids in
black and other non-traditional colors these days, the rules are
fluid. One caution: When photographs are taken, the color might
blend with your gown, so place a flower girl or tuxedoed member of
the wedding party between you and your mother. Q: I have a Persian
cat named Tuffy, and he is always a challenge to groom. I would
like to find a place that offers training so that I can groom him
safely, especially to get his fur unmatted.
</P>
<P>
   _Chris Brown
</P>
<P>
   A: Persians have long hair that presents unique grooming
problems. Even though cats are self-groomers, long-hair cats rarely
control matting without human assistance. Babette Ellis of Exmoor
Pet Services offers consultations on how to groom your cat that
include at-home tips as well as a regular professional schedule.
She warns customers never to bathe a pet with matted hair (it
exacerbates the problem). Mats can be untangled, brushed out or cut
out. Remember, feline skin is very sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the ``com'' stand for in e-mail addresses? Someone
asked me and I was unable to answer, but bet you can. My guess?
``Commerce.'' _A.O.
</P>
<P>
   A: You are close. ``Com'' stands for ``commercial
organization,'' a domain, an area address, in computer-speak. Other
common organizational domains are: ``edu,'' educational
institution; ``gov,'' government; ``int,'' international
organization; ``mil,'' military; ``net,'' networking organization
and ``org,'' nonprofit organization. Organizational domains were
developed as part of the addressing scheme before networks were
worldwide, which explains geographic domains such as ``au'' for
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who do I write to get a copy of my father's Navy records from
World War II? He served in the Pacific theater.
</P>
<P>
   _ Joe G.
</P>
<P>
   A: ObtainStandard Form 180, which is available online at
www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/people/faq/.www/records.html or by
contacting the National Personal Records Center by mail at 9700
Page Blvd., St. Louis, MO 63132 or by phone at (314) 538-4141.
Requests by someone other than the veteran must include the
specific relationship and proof of death. Q: Help me figure out how
to deodorize the seat-belt shoulder strap on my new-used car. The
previous owner was a little too fond of Shalimar, and it's embedded
in the weave of the strap. I've had the car professionally
detailed, but no improvement. _B.H.
</P>
<P>
   A: Introduced in 1925 by Guerlain, Shalimar has always been a
very popular scent. Auto detailing guru Chris Kuehne of Auto Image
notes shoulder straps, especially on newer-model cars, are one of
the few items you cannot simply wash. Try his cleaning method to
render your car's seat belts a Shalimar-free zone.
</P>
<P>
   Go to a do-it-yourself carwash. Extend the shoulder belt as far
as possible and close the door on it. Most of the shoulder-strap
seat belt should be outside the car. Wrap the belt's metal buckle
in a towel to protect the paint.
</P>
<P>
   Use upholstery shampoo and a pressure hose to wash the belt.
Towel dry and drive home. Extend the belt again, close the door and
let the sun dry it thoroughly. Kuehne's only caution? Do not let
upholstery shampoo dry on your car's paint.

 &HT;    New exhibit at King historic site spotlights children's civil
rights fight
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Have you ever thought about what you can do to make
the world a better place?
</P>
<P>
   Ruby Bridges did. In 1960, she became the first black student to
attend an all-white New Orleans elementary school. She was only 6
years old.
</P>
<P>
   Her brave integration of the school is profiled in the new
``Children of Courage'' exhibit. It opened last week at the
visitors center of the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic
Site in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Along with people like the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa
Parks, who fought for civil rights, were young school-aged people
like Bridges who made sacrifices to make the world a better place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stories of the young pioneers in the civil rights movement
told in this exhibition will inspire today's youth and help them
realize that they, too, can make a difference,'' said Donald
Greene, president of the Coca-Cola Foundation. A grant from the
foundation paid for the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit documents the important role children played in the
civil rights movement. It will be permanent, along with the current
exhibit exploring civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives the children an interactive way to look at what it
was like to grow up under segregation. When you try to tell someone
that there were white and black water fountains, they have a hard
time believing it,'' said Frank Catroppa, superintendent of the
King historic site.
</P>
<P>
   The interactive exhibit uses computers and photos. Visitors can
ask questions and solve problems like those the children of the
civil rights movement faced.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the exhibit, students are asked who will be the
leaders of tomorrow. When they open a window, they see a mirror
with their reflection.
</P>
<P>
   ``This adds a new dimension to the story being told at one of
the country's premier national historic sites and conveys Dr.
King's message of justice, equality and nonviolence to all the
world's children,'' said Robert Stanton, director of the National
Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1980, the Martin Luther King Jr. National
Historic Site honors King's life, legacy and teachings. The site,
which is part of the National Park System, contains the home where
King was born; Ebenezer Baptist Church, where he preached; the
Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change; King's
grave site; Fire Station No. 6 Museum; and the residential and
commercial districts of the Sweet Auburn community.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   Where: Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site, 450 Auburn
Ave. N.E., Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   When: Generally, it's open
</P>
<P>
   9 a.m. to 5 p.m. until Memorial Day weekend; from then until
Labor Day, it's open 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets: There is no entrance fee.
</P>
<P>
   Information: (404) 331-5190 or

 &HT;    AOL, Time Warner unite
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ America Online (AOL) and Time Warner announced this
week that they will join forces _ or ``merge.'' (Think Woody
teaming up with Buzz Lightyear.)
</P>
<P>
   AOL is the company that many of us use to log onto the Internet
and to check our e-mail. Time Warner creates magazines, movies and
TV shows. It also owns Atlanta's CNN, Cartoon Network and World
Championship Wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   After the companies combine, AOL will be able offer its online
customers Time Warner's news and entertainment. In turn, Time
Warner will be able to distribute its material on the Internet
through AOL.
</P>
<P>
   What does the merger mean to you? With this and other media
mergers, like Disney's takeover of ABC, it means we're getting our
news from fewer sources.
</P>
<P>
   Some people think that's bad. Others don't think that's a
problem. They say the mergers make the companies stronger.
</P>
<P>
   The government still has to approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   BOY STAYS IN U.S. _ FOR NOW
</P>
<P>
   The battle continues over a 6-year-old Cuban boy whose mother
died bringing him to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, Elian Gonzalez, was found on Thanksgiving clinging to
an inner tube in the water off the Florida coast. His mother,
stepfather and eight other people had drowned while fleeing from
Cuba by boat. Many Cubans risk their lives to make the 90-mile
crossing between the United States and Cuba because they believe
their lives would be better in this country. Cuba has a Communist
government.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the U.S. immigration service said the boy should
be returned to his father in Cuba. It set a deadline of last Friday
for his return.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno lifted the deadline to give
Elian's Miami relatives a chance to fight for the boy in court.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Cuban mothers marched last week to protest the boy
not being returned.
</P>
<P>
   ROCKER TALKS TO BLACK LEADERS
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Braves relief pitcher John Rocker is trying to make up
for insulting comments he made about foreigners, gays and others.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the pitcher said in a Sports Illustrated
article: ``The biggest thing I don't like about New York are the
foreigners. You can walk an entire block in Times Square and not
hear anybody speaking English.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker apologized last week on the ESPN sports cable channel for
the comments and denied being a racist.
</P>
<P>
   He said teammates Andruw Jones, Bruce Chen and Odalis Perez, all
minorities, had lived with his family in Macon. ``If I was a
racist, would I want a black guy living in my house and would I
invite him to come to my house?'' Rocker asked.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker got advice from former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young and
baseball legend Hank Aaron on how to deal with hatred.

 &HT;    America, frame-by-frame
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is one of the rites of passage in American life,
the desire to drive across the country. But who is lucky enough to
have the time and freedom to do it? Now, thanks to the World Wide
Web, you can at least see what it looks like _ every last mile.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Frondorf, a San Antonio-based engineer, wanted to cross our
nation's midsection for years. With some help from Kodak, he did.
Starting in New York, Frondorf took a picture every mile, all 3,304
of them, until he reached San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The results can be viewed on the Web, at www.kodak.com
</P>
<P>
   /US/en/corp/features
</P>
<P>
   /onTheRoad. Looking at the pictures requires a Flash multimedia
plug-in, which can be downloaded from the site for free.
</P>
<P>
   Frondorf actually made the trip twice. He had to bring a tripod
and clamps that mounted the 35 mm camera to his passenger side
window. On the first pass, he brought a Porsche but not a
wide-angle lens. As a result, the Rocky Mountain stretch of
Interstate 70 included a lot of close-ups of rock walls. The
low-riding Porsche also created quite a few guardrail shots.
</P>
<P>
   The next trip was in June in a high-riding Ford Explorer.
Frondorf traveled mostly on older highways, including U.S. 30, U.S.
40 and U.S. 50. The trip took six days.
</P>
<P>
   Frondorf would stop when the natural light started to fade. He'd
mark his spot and look for a motel. He used a Canon T-90 with a
wide-angle lens and a motor drive. Shooting through the window
meant he did not run the air conditioning, so he kept the film in a
cooler. The shutter was triggered by a device hooked to the
odometer. Every time a mile passed, the shutter released.
</P>
<P>
   SITE COVERS CEREAL WITH SOME SOGGY PROSE
</P>
<P>
   If you love cereal _ and we're not talking old-fashioned Cream
of Wheat, we're talking dessert cereal _ consider www
</P>
<P>
   .emptybowl.com.
</P>
<P>
   The site is an invaluable resource to lovers of Cap'n Crunch,
Cocoa Puffs and Count Chocula _ name brands that are to breakfast
what the chalupa and the Big Mac are to lunch and dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The site features reviews. December's top 10 list is from Mike
D.
</P>
<P>
   Health Choice Mueslix was rated 10th for its ``good texture and
interesting extras like the proper use of dates.''
</P>
<P>
   Cinnamon Life was next, praised for its subtle sweetness but
marked down for getting soggy to soon. ``Still, the taste is
sassy.''
</P>
<P>
   Golden Grahams came in seventh, cited as ``tasty vittles that
work best with milk products.'' The review comes with this
advisory: ``Do NOT use Cherry Coke with syrup. Way too sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   Cocoa Puffs were next. They're considered a reliable replacement
to Count Chocula and come with a nice bonus: ``When the Count is
out of town and I need a different texture, Cocoa Puffs do the job.
They can also make some chocolate milk for you if you're out of
syrup.''
</P>
<P>
   The top-ranking cereal is a blast from the past: Kaboom. ``Some
people cry over old lovers. I cry over Kaboom! It was the
onomotopoeia of cereals. The milk would turn into some crazy color,
and the cereal was multicolored and marshmallow-filled. Plus, it
made its own gravy.''
</P>
<P>
   The site also includes a feature called ``Point Counterpoint.''
In the December offering, two staffers debate the virtues of skim
milk vs. 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A sample: Skim milk is not overpowering. It has the flavor of
milk but does not weigh down your meal. You can drink your cereal's
leftovers without the feeling of guilt. It gives you calcium while
not feeling like it's moving down your throat like some leftover
ooze from ``The Blob'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   A counterpoint: Skim milk? If you're going to use skim milk, why
not just use water? You get the same flavor. Once, during the week
when Will's sister was a vegetarian, she insisted on only drinking
skim milk. Once, when there wasn't any in the house and she was
yelling and complaining, Will took half a glass of whole milk and
filled the rest up with tap water. She drank it and said it tasted
great! Is that what you want on your cereal?

 &HT;    Late to the game, Apple adds series of Net-based services
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Apple announced a dizzying number of new initiatives
at the recent MacWorld Expo in San Francisco. It's no wonder some
got lost in the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at one in particular that, although it received
little attention, is very important to Apple.
</P>
<P>
   This initiative is called iTools, and it's an effort to raise
Apple's profile and usefulness on the Internet. In essence, iTools
is a collection of six free Internet-based consumer services.
</P>
<P>
   The services include electronic mail, a database of ``kid-safe''
Web sites, file storage, and space to build and maintain a Web
page.
</P>
<P>
   None of these services is unique. If anything, Apple is late to
the game in offering them. Many other sites, including Microsoft's,
are offering all or more of these services.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, though, Apple can distinguish itself by how well it
executes Internet-based services. At first glance they certainly
look classy.
</P>
<P>
   There's one caveat when it comes to using them right away. A
user must have Apple's latest operating system, OS 9. Other
operating systems won't work.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find iTools as a tab on Apple's redesigned Web page. The
new design features a platinum look similar to that of the
company's operating system. Along the top of the page is a series
of tabs. Click on the one named iTools, and you'll go to a page
that briefly describes each of the four services and asks you to
register in order to use any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in brief, is a description of each of the new services:
</P>
<P>
   _ Mac.com: You can now send and receive e-mail through Apple's
Web site. It works pretty much like the other such services on the
Net.
</P>
<P>
   _ KidSafe: Apple has built a database of 55,000 sites it has
tested for appropriateness for kids. Signing onto KidSafe blocks
you from going to any other sites. It works in the reverse manner
of a filter. Instead of filtering out sites, it simply offers safe
ones. The site does filter incoming e-mail, chat room
correspondence and online games for inappropriate language and
images.
</P>
<P>
   _ IDisk: This service provides 20 megabytes to users. That is
not a lot, but it is free. It's also accessible from wherever you
access the Internet. IDisk also lets you share and export files and
images with others. You could, for example, store a picture of your
family and then copy it into an electronic card to send to friends.
</P>
<P>
   _ Home page: With this service you can build and maintain a
personal Web page.
</P>
<P>
   _ ICards: This where you can import photos from iDisk and create
electronic cards to send through the Net.
</P>
<P>
   _ IReview: This is a separate page where members of iTools can
post and read reviews of various products, Web pages and services.

 &HT;    Merger fallout uncertain
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the past week, all the pundits and analysts have
been busy trying to figure out how the AOL-Time Warner merger will
change our lives, raise our cable rates, increase the hole in the
ozone or help the Cubs win the pennant.
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to talk about the potential of this new
enterprise and the role TV/Internet guru Bob Pittman, AOL's
president, could have on the digital music revolution as well as
broadband content development, but the results of the deal remain
to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   So instead, I'd like to ``take a moment'' as they say on ``Ally
McBeal'' and remember that AOL and Time Warner have been
insinuating themselves into our lives long before Steve Case, Ted
Turner and Gerald Levin were all smiling and clapping in front of
the scariest pile of media logos ever collected in one place.
</P>
<P>
   When I finished college, I went to work for Little, Brown &AMP;
Co.'s college textbook division. It was fun for a while, but I soon
discovered all the disparaging things GenX author Jay McInerney
said about low-level publishing jobs were true, and I decided to
move on. I resigned on Monday, and on Wednesday employees were told
that the company would merge with motion picture giant Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction at the staid Boston publishing house was one of
sheer horror. Editors were stuffing their resumes into fax machines
faster than you could say ``Bugs Bunny.'' The very idea that the
company founded by Henry Luce, which published such venerable
magazines as Time and Life and had such noted talents as Norman
Mailer, Ellen Gilchrist and Ansel Adams, was going to join up with
a movie studio was just appalling.
</P>
<P>
   My boss, a wonderful editor named Alex, just shook his head and
murmured, ``The writing was right there on the wall, and I wasn't
wearing my glasses.'' The new Time Warner divested its textbook
division and a few other moldy properties and continued its march
toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   I moved to New York City about the time America Online was
gaining mainstream popularity. It was also the subject of much
ridicule for its ``carpet bombing'' marketing technique for
packaging AOL diskettes in everything except cans of Campbell's
soup.
</P>
<P>
   My boss had a box of AOL diskettes under his desk, which he
collected from all over the place. It was a great curiosity, and
people loved to look at all the versions and types and colors of
AOL disks that were actually in circulation. Marc was devastated
when the janitorial staff mistook his collection for trash. I
suspect ``Antiques Road Show'' would probably be interested in that
box now.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, people liked AOL, even the Web geeks who usually
had another Internet provider to get them out to the Web. (AOL
hadn't done any of its famous deals with Netscape or Microsoft
yet.) Every month founder Steve Case would write a letter to
members that would be featured prominently on the AOL welcome
screen, and people read them.
</P>
<P>
   They talked about ``Steve'' like they knew him. The service had
only 4 million or 5 million members then. People were known to have
actual conversations online without being accosted by potential
child molesters, credit card thieves or rowdy teens with stupid
screen names.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, AOL went to a flat-rate pricing plan that was
novel in the industry. The crush of subscribers who logged on for
hours on end just because they could nearly brought the system to
its knees. People were livid. They were doing everything from
circulating online petitions to e-mailing Steve Case personally to
complain.
</P>
<P>
   You see, back in 1997, millions of people thought they could
just drop a note to Steve, and that he might read it and actually
do something. Usually what you got back was a form letter, but
still it was something.
</P>
<P>
   AOL had the knack of making millions of people all feel like
part of one big happy but slightly dysfunctional family. I actually
know several couples who met on AOL and not in a romance chat room,
either. A group of people used to meet every Sunday night to talk
about alternative rock music, and I never missed a week.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times also sponsored a moderated book chat that was
one of the best book groups I've ever dropped in on. AOL connected
people, almost in the same way the pictures from the old Life
magazine used to, which is one reason all the pundits say this
merger makes so much sense.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually AOL's troubles led Case to television to convince
users that the dial-up debacle would never happen ever, ever again.
Nevertheless, he threw the door wide open for upstarts like
MindSpring, EarthLink, AT&AMP;T's WorldNet and a host of other Internet
service providers to offer Net access without endless busy signals
and mail server crashes and with customer service people who might
actually help you.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow, people stayed loyal to AOL. The service continued
to grow and develop into something that not just first-time Net
users but seasoned and cynical veterans might like, with
innovations in Web access, electronic commerce and instant
messaging across the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at the start of the 21st century, AOL, the online service
I've been using since I got my first PC, is merging with Time
Warner, the company I was working for when I got my first PC. AOL
Time Warner has grown from being a print publisher to a movie,
cable, news, sports, music and now Internet provider.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too big? Who knows? Probably, but I still remember when
people thought that Time magazine and Warner music and CNN all
being owned by the same company was unthinkable. I wonder how much
they'll want for a piece of Microsoft?

 &HT;    Search engines: Underpowered, oil-leaking
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ We wanted to come up with lots of reasons why
the creation of the Internet search engine has made our lives
simpler, more efficient and easier to pursue as we look for help
navigating the Web. But after looking for evidence on the Net and
getting back search results like ``Hot Blondes want to talk to YOU
_ XXX!'' and links to personal home pages for engineers in
Istanbul, we reversed our position.
</P>
<P>
   A study released last year by the NEC Research Institute in
Princeton, N.J., found even the largest search engines only cover
about one-sixth of what's on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And we would argue that it's not even the correct one-sixth.
</P>
<P>
   What caused such a mess? Much like the Titanic, it was the
result of hubris: While a few search engines, such as Yahoo!, use
humans to catalog Web sites into the correct categories and
indexes, most sites tried to do the same by creating ``smart''
software that did it automatically. The result? Thousands of
irrelevant results on the simplest of requests.
</P>
<P>
   So, all you incompetent, frustrating search engines out there _
we have one last search request for you: ``Get bent.''

 &HT;    Cutting edge gadgets for 2000
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News ServiceThe first Consumer Electronics Show of
<TEXT>
the third millennium was held last week in Las Vegas. The
conference shows off the cool gadgets and gizmos you'll be seeing
this year and beyond. Gadgetry is in hyperdrive, with some 7,000
new products on the way. Here are the best of the best, the cutting
edge of the cutting edge due out this year. A cautionary note: The
products' release dates and prices are tentative and, at the time
of electronics show, could not be confirmed. That means not
everything is guaranteed to hit store shelves. Some gadgets may be
destined to only exist on the shelves of their creators:
<P>
   GENIUS CALLING
</P>
<P>
   Who: Ericsson, www.ericsson.com
</P>
<P>
   What: R380 Smart Phone. The Smart Phone is the size of an
average mobile phone but has a flip keypad which transforms the
communication device into a palm-sized computer. The phone is
totally jammed with features including Internet capability and PDA.
The R380 will feature a calendar, address software, WAP browser
(which enables you to see Web pages without the graphics) and
handwriting recognition software. The phone is also voice-activated
for the hands-free executive in you. Oh, and if that's not enough,
the R380 can also be an MP3 music player.
</P>
<P>
   When: Tentatively June/July (in limited areas)
</P>
<P>
   How much: to be announced
</P>
<P>
   STRAIGHT SHOOTER
</P>
<P>
   Who: JVC, www.jvc.com
</P>
<P>
   What: GR-DVL9800. This is the top-of-the-line JVC digital video
camera to be released this year. The camera has been reduced in
size and now is about the size of your hand. The optics have been
totally overhauled and the camera lightened. It will double as a
true digital camera. While other digital video cameras capture
images off the tape, the JVC captures high resolution XGA digital
stills on a separate, removable MultimediaCard. This will let the
user film and photograph simultaneously. The camera comes with an
automatic pop-up flash.
</P>
<P>
   When: February
</P>
<P>
   How much: $1,400
</P>
<P>
   AURAL ORB

   Who: Morel, www.morel.co.il
</P>
<P>
   What: Soundspot SA-2. This 4.5-inch speaker won a CES
``Innovations'' award for its design and superior sound. The tiny
orb speaker was developed to be integrated into home theaters.
While its physical profile is almost nonexistent, the sound is
fantastic. This is due to Morel's own, super-secret audio
technology, cryptically called EVC (external voice coil). The
result: speakers that would make any audiophile rapturous.
</P>
<P>
   When: March
</P>
<P>
   How much: $530 a pair
</P>
<P>
   LI'L BUDDY

customized call answering, up to 20 individualized voice mail
boxes, memo recording and conference calls. But that's just the
beginning. Cybergenie can also access your E-mail and faxes and
read them to you over the phone. As a bonus, the Cybergenie can
call you whenever a voice mail, E-mail or fax comes in and read it
to you. The system is especially designed with the small office and
the home office users in mind.
</P>
<P>
   When: End of this month
</P>
<P>
   How much: $500 (one cordless handset is included), $130 each for

side-by-side, a little taller than a cigarette pack and weighs 2.5
ounces _ is packaged with a 64-megabyte removable Memorystick card
(Sony's proprietary memory device). The Memorystick Walkman will
enable you to download an hour's worth of music in just over three
minutes and is USB compatible.
</P>
<P>
   When: February
</P>
<P>

navigation input. The mechanics are smooth and the screen releases
at the touch of a button. The multimedia station also features
Alpine's Versatile-Link technology for the easy hookup of portable
MP3 players and video game systems.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Take care of calls with CyberGenie
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ One of the things that separates big companies
from little companies is that big companies often have assistants
to answer calls and forward messages.
</P>
<P>
   Now Cygnion Corp. has introduced a device that turns the small
business owner's personal computer into a personal assistant.
</P>
<P>
   The CyberGenie PC Cordless Phone System directs incoming calls
to as many as 20 different users, forwards calls to outside phones
and notifies users when e-mails and faxes have arrived. And instead
of forcing callers to push buttons, the CyberGenie recognizes
spoken commands.
</P>
<P>
   CyberGenie won an Innovation Award as one of the best new
devices exhibited at the International Consumer Electronics Show in
Las Vegas earlier this month. It is scheduled to start arriving in
CompUSA, Office Depot and other stores by February.
</P>
<P>
   The basic CyberGenie system will sell for $499 and comes with a
2.4GHz digital spread spectrum base station, one cordless handset
and a software disk. It connects to a personal computer through a
USB port and connects to the phone system through standard phone
jacks.
</P>
<P>
   CyberGenie is designed to work in homes and small businesses
with two incoming phone lines. Users can buy up to nine extra
cordless handset and charger units for $129 each.
</P>
<P>
   The system can set up 20 voice mail boxes, and callers reach
their parties simply by speaking their names or dialing their
extensions.
</P>
<P>
   CyberGenie gives its users remote access to e-mail messages and
faxes. The users call into the system, and CyberGenie uses voice
simulation software to read e-mail and faxes over the phone. The
system also offers other phone system features such as conference
calls and calls between handsets within the office.
</P>
<P>
   For additional information on CyberGenie you can visit
www.cygnion.com online or call (877) 438-4364 (GET-GENIE).

 &HT;    Digital age mega-mergers create settlers, not pioneers
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There is a little shop in Gwinnett County that sells
ice cream that is truly homemade. Unlike the big-name chain ice
cream shops, it doesn't have 84 flavors, it's not fancy and the
prices are relatively high.
</P>
<P>
   But there is always a big line to buy the ice cream. That line
is filled with people who don't mind driving a little farther and
paying a little more for a small selection of really exceptional
ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the announcement that AOL and Time Warner will
merge _ creating a chain store of media unlike any that exists now
_ the experts are predicting with the solemn voice of prophets that
this is the dawn of a new digital age with new rules. You are being
told that the giant new company is the pioneer of the new digital
age.
</P>
<P>
   The experts are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   I think they need to calm down and buy a bowl of homemade peach
ice cream at that down-home little stand.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot to learn from ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Let me give you my own peach-flavored prediction of the future.
Keep in mind that it comes from a fellow who is only expert at ice
cream and typing.
</P>
<P>
   I think the combination is just one more enormous merger. That,
rather than breaking the mold, it is merely a part of a pattern
that should look familiar to you by now.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the merger means to you as a customer: You'll be
able to decide if you want to patronize a new chain of stores. This
chain will sell information. It'll do it efficiently, and there
will be a sameness and a consistency that will appeal to a lot of
people. Like any chain operation, the prices will be good, the
selection of information will be large, and _ as Holiday Inn once
promised in its ads _ you'll find very few surprises.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing in the world wrong with finding that
attractive. A lot of people will. That's the whole notion of the
deal _ big numbers of customers that will turn into big advertising
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will have great power because it is big. So it
will be able to make good deals when it buys and sells. It'll hire
smart and safe people to run the operation. They'll be the managers
of the chain of media stores and will make sure that the stock in
trade _ price, consistency and efficiency _ is maintained.
</P>
<P>
   There will be disadvantages, too. The company will be so big
that it'll react slower than the small companies. That's an
important disadvantage since the rules of the Internet change so
fast. By the time a giant company stops to hold board meetings and
hire marketing consultants to figure out how to cash in on these
changes, it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being the pioneer, the giant will follow paths blazed
by the explorers of the media world. That isn't such a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   But it means that the AOL and Time Warner merger won't create an
innovator in the new digital age. Instead, the new company is more
like the settlers who followed the pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Some customers _ most of them really _ will prefer that. Other
customers, a smaller group, will want things the big company can't
offer, so they'll search out the small media stands that aren't
part of a chain.
</P>
<P>
   Those very attributes of size, consistency and safety inherent
in the big company will open new niches for smart small companies
that are able to move faster and take more chances. The best of
these small companies will realize that they won't be able to
compete with chain store rules. So they will ignore the rules.
They'll concentrate on making the best bowl of homemade peach ice
cream possible, and they'll charge enough for it to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   There will always be advantages for the big companies. And _
thank God a mercy _ there will always be a market for really good
homemade peach ice cream.

 &HT;    Looking for a loan? Shop online and save
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They don't have to give you credit, but there are
plenty of people out there in cyberspace who would be delighted to
do just that. Whether you're looking for a house loan or a car
loan, there are online lenders in just that business.
</P>
<P>
   And there are other sites and services online that specialize in
helping you decide whether you can qualify for a loan and, if you
can, that will help you calculate just how much you can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with a common scenario: You own a home, have a
mortgage but wonder if you're getting a good deal. Is now a good
time to refinance? Yahoo _ which has several impressive loan
services _ has just the tool you need at loan.yahoo.com/m/mm.html.
When you go to that page, you'll fill out a fairly lengthy form
answering questions including what interest you're paying, where
you live, the value of the property, the type of property
(single-family home, condo, etc.) and the remaining balance on your
loan.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just push the button. You'll be told if the program can
find other deals that beat the one you have now.
</P>
<P>
   Before we leave the Yahoo loan center, let's take a look at one
more service at www.giggocar.com/yahoo/affordability.asp. It does
the calculations that will help you decide just how much you can
afford to pay for a car. While you may not like the answers, it's a
good starting point for making a buying decision.
</P>
<P>
   Now we'll look at some auto loan sites _ places online that will
lend you money to buy a car. Before we do, remember that this is
not an endorsement of the sites or an assurance you will get a good
deal. Just as you would before obtaining any loan, you need to
compare rates and also assure yourself that the company is a good
one to do business with.
</P>
<P>
   The first site at www.world-funding
</P>
<P>
   -group.com/ tries to give that assurance with a big sticker from
the Better Business Bureau. There's also a toll-free number to
call. The site has loan calculators that will give you a good idea
what sort of payments you would make before applying.
</P>
<P>
   Since most of these sites offer the same services, let's just
list one other auto loan page. You'll find PeopleFirstFinance at
www.peoplefirst.com/pff/sitewhoweare
</P>
<P>
   .cfm. It's been in business since 1997, which _ in the online
world _ is a long stand.
</P>
<P>
   Our next site is called Loan Locator.Com. The premise here is
that you select the type of loan you're interested in (auto, home,
etc.) and then fill out a form. Once that is complete, you're told
that you'll receive at least four e-mails offering you a loan.
Again, let the buyer beware. The site is located at
popwords.com/locator/mortgage
</P>
<P>
   /Arkansas.mortgage.lead
</P>
<P>
   /bad-credit-mortgage.asp.
</P>
<P>
   A similar site _ which specializes in mortgages _ is called
GetSmart.Com and is located at www.getsmart.com/mortgage
</P>
<P>
   /HomeBanner?BANNERNAME &QC; 0.
</P>
<P>
   At Atlanta-based Real Estate.Com, the notion of shopping a loan
is taken to a new level. Simply go to www.realestate.com
</P>
<P>
   /mortgageauction/home.asp and fill out the form. Your mortgage
application is submitted automatically to more than 250 potential
lenders. You're promised that you'll start getting bids competing
for your business in 24 hours or so.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Lending Tree, an online outfit that advertises
you'll ``apply in minutes _ know within hours.'' It's located at
homepages.go.com/homepages/v/i/e
</P>
<P>
   /viewcosmic/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget, by the way, that more conventional lenders also
have Web sites. So, while searching for an online loan, check out
the Web site maintained by your bank or mortgage lenders in your
area.

 &HT;    Will the geeks inherit the earth?
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The fate of a brand-new, first-rate TV series is
often fragile. Especially if it's different, it needs all the help
it can get. And in this age of new technology, cybersurfers may be
the key to salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Take ``Freaks and Geeks,'' for example. This funny, poignant and
painfully realistic look at high school life in the '80s debuted on
NBC last fall to resounding critical acclaim. Time magazine crowed,
``Television has rarely gotten adolescence as hilariously,
soul-crushingly right as in this bittersweet paean to Midwestern
childhood.'' Rolling Stone called it ``one of the season's best
shows.''
</P>
<P>
   But from the beginning, the deck was stacked against ``Freaks.''
Scheduled in the dead zone of Saturday nights, the show quickly
sagged to the bottom of the ratings and was yanked in early
November. In response to fervent begging by producers and the
heartfelt pleas from a small but wildly loyal band of fans,
``Freaks and Geeks'' was relaunched in a new time period _ Mondays
at 7 _ last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is such an ax hanging over our heads,'' creator-producer
Paul Feig said in a fast-paced phone call from his office recently.
``The network has told us we have to get an 8 share. If we do, the
network will order four more episodes. If not, we'll have to shut
down production and wait to see how the rest of our episodes do.
We'll just have to keep our fingers crossed.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a tiny light at the end of the tunnel. Last Tuesday
morning's Nielsen ratings gave the show an 8 share _ not a smidgen
more. Despite days of on-air promotions and frantic Web activity,
the return of ``Freaks and Geeks'' didn't soar as NBC hoped. But it
didn't crash either, despite pre-emptions for telethons and sports
events in several parts of the country, including here, where the
San Antonio Spurs took the time slot. The rating was enough to
prompt NBC on Wednesday to give the green light for more episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Before the show's return, Feig (who based the show on his
high-school experiences) and his geeky gang of writers tapped into
the network of fans that buzz around the show's Web site. The
cyberspot (freaksandgeeks.com), launched before the show's debut,
has a bulletin board, chat room, direct lines to the producers,
story information and biographies of cast and crew. Fans share
their own ``geek'' experiences with each other and with the
writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we would have a good Internet presence,'' Feig says.
``The Internet is filled with outsiders, just like the kids in our
show. It's an easy way to keep in communication. I get on at least
once a day, not so much to get story ideas as to fact-check the
ones we have and answer questions.''
</P>
<P>
   When the ratings began to sag last fall, Feig and executive
producer Judd Apatow (``The Larry Sanders Show'') used the site to
orchestrate a write-in campaign to the network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured that was our best shot,'' Feig says. ``It's not
really advertising so much as a forum we invite people into. We
have a nice village of people, but that's not enough. We're urging
them to spread the word about our move to Monday nights.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time the Internet has been used to promote
entertainment. Last summer, ``The Blair Witch Project'' stirred
such a ruckus on the Internet that it changed the face of movie
marketing. But it didn't introduce the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brought Internet marketing to the attention of a lot of
people, but it had already been used by a lot of people,'' says
Deborah Hamberlin, NBC's vice president of corporate advertising.
``It just made it more mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   When ``The X-Files'' was struggling in 1993, for instance,
creator Chris Carter and the rabid army of X-philes stirred up
interest on the Web, which was filled with the sort of people _
sci-fi loving freaks and geeks, that is _ who would appreciate the
show.
</P>
<P>
   Now just about all TV series have Web sites, although most are
pretty basic. An exception about five years ago was the elaborate
Web-only episodes of NBC's cop drama ``Homicide: Life on the
Street.''
</P>
<P>
   For the return of ``Freaks and Geeks,'' NBC hired Interactive
Agency to promote the show on the World Wide Web. But the show's
own Web site remains the principal hub of activity. It may be the
first time a network has actually pleaded with viewers via the Web
to spread the word.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a guerrilla marketing campaign,'' says Hamberlin.
``We're hoping to put that core fan group to work. There are lots
of them, and they're passionate about their program. I think this
approach only works on things that have a passionate fan base. What
the Internet can do that other media cannot is engage a group of
people talking amongst themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, the show's Web site was oozing praise for the
previous night's episode and pleas for NBC to keep the show going:
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't cancel this show! ... It deserves a chance, and I
hope the network gets behind it and promotes it.''
</P>
<P>
   What's the big deal about a high school show, especially one
about nerds and weirdos? Well, it's strikingly real, sort of a
cross between ``The Wonder Years'' and ``The Real World.'' The kids
don't look or act like Hollywood actors. They have unkempt hair,
bad skin and crooked teeth. And the story lines spring from real
life, not from some fantasy of what teen life should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this show, the teens actually talk like teens,'' states one
chat room fan.
</P>
<P>
   Set in a suburban high school in 1980, the show focuses on the
funny and often touching lives of two teens trying to survive class
and cafeteria crises. On the freaks side is Lindsay Weir (Linda
Cardellini), a sophomore who used to be a clean-cut intellectual
but now hangs out with a rebellious crowd. The geeks are led by
Lindsay's freshman brother Sam (John Daly), who is woefully small
and immature for his age and constantly battling a bully. Sam's
friends include the cocky science nerd Neal (Samm Levine) and the
hilariously geeky Bill (Martin Starr).
</P>
<P>
   One of the best episodes found Sam and the geeks struggling with
whether freshmen are too old to go trick-or-treating.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's episode reintroduced the show with an episode about
Lindsay and pals trying to get fake IDs, and Sam and pals worrying
that a pretty new girl will dump them as soon as she meets the
popular in-crowd. In a subplot, the siblings' excruciatingly
realistic parents try to lure them into family activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We created you, and we deserve respect. ... I'm fed up,'' the
father bellows. ``We're going to be close from now on, whether you
like it or not!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who have been watching are mostly those who grew up
in the '80s, who remember what it was like in high school at that
time,'' Feig says. ``But it's a broad spectrum, from teens and kids
to people _ probably parents _ in their 40s. What we need to do now
is educate people to realize it's not a kids' show. We want to
appeal to the `Seinfeld' and `Simpsons' crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, in a perfect world where quality TV succeeds, should just
be a matter of getting the word out _ electronically or face to
face.

 &HT;    Schools get failing grade for passing over teacher
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ ``I went to college seven years for this? No
pay? No job? And worst of all, no respect?'' That's my frustrated
friend Gail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yup.'' That's my erudite answer which loosely translates to,
``I've been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gail's husband died when her three children were small. She
raised them on her own and then, after the last one had flown the
nest, went back to college to finish the education that marriage
and babies had interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gotta' get that degree'' was the mantra that kept her going
through summer rains and winter snows as she wound old Phred's
speedometer to the max with her almost two-hour each way daily
commute. Phred was the green Subaru that finally threw itself on
its back, wheels up, and refused to haul another history book to
Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   Gail persevered, replacing Phred with Phoebe, a red Toyota.
``Without that piece of paper I'll never have a decent job,'' she'd
remind herself when the drive, the workload, and the expense
threatened to overwhelm her.
</P>
<P>
   So, just like the U.S. Postal service, through sleet and double
pneumonia, Gail forged on until seven years later she had the
education and the piece of paper with Cum Laude stamped in the
lower left corner to prove that not only had she paid her tuition
and showed up for class, but that she'd busted her backside (and
Phred's and Phoebe's) and distinguished herself right nicely in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Credentials in hand, Gail began visiting schools within a
15-mile radius of her home. Then a 20-miles radius. When she
reached 40-miles with the same answers, she became a little
discouraged. It seems no one needed a 53-year-old history teacher
with a master's degree but this was her lucky day _ they all needed
substitutes and would (SET ITAL)love(END ITAL) to add her name to
their list. She said OK, and now one school or another uses her
almost every day _ 60 bucks and no benefits.
</P>
<P>
   So where are the full-time jobs, she wonders. Were all of the
rumors she'd heard of a teacher shortage just that? Rumors?
</P>
<P>
   And when an opening for a full-time classroom teacher comes up,
what happens? A 23-year-old with a bachelor's degree and lousy
grammar probably lands the job because she's lower on the pay
scale.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's like the high school principal who refused to hire
me when I was 54 and fresh out of college. His illuminating comment
to his coaching buddies was, ``Wa-aal, if we gotta' work with 'em
(women) they might as well be young and good lookin'.'' Nice guy,
huh? I was kind of annoyed with him until I figured out what his
problem was _ his brains had slid to his belly.
</P>
<P>
   If school administrations weren't constantly threatened with
penury they wouldn't have to go for the ``cheap'' as opposed to the
highly qualified. And what about the states now demanding that
teachers have in hand, or at least in sight, a master's degree?
Who's going to pay for that?
</P>
<P>
   It would seem to me that any school administrator with a
half-way intelligent board of education backing him (or her) must
be aware that a 53-year-old teacher is a wise investment, bringing
a lot more to the classroom than a piece of paper and a mini-skirt.
What about life experience? What about dignity? And what about the
fact that few 53-somethings request maternity leave?
</P>
<P>
   Gail had been looking forward to having her very own classroom,
and through the years has amassed a rather respectable collection
of reference books that she had planned on sharing with her
students. Her dream was to stimulate learning and maybe make a
difference in a few kids' lives. Now she's trying to find a used
book store to take them off her hands because she knows there's no
classroom in her future.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the teaching profession has lost a potentially
valuable member _ one with much to contribute. Of course, it has
gained a sub, at least for a while, until the lack of pay and
benefits and the daily threat of being eaten alive by a bunch of
15-year-olds loses its charm and sends yet another highly qualified
teaching candidate to work in a bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   Smart move, Bozos.

 &HT;    America, frame-by-frame
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is one of the rites of passage in American life,
the desire to drive across the country. But who is lucky enough to
have the time and freedom to do it? Now, thanks to the World Wide
Web, you can at least see what it looks like _ every last mile.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Frondorf, a San Antonio-based engineer, wanted to cross our
nation's midsection for years. With some help from Kodak, he did.
Starting in New York, Frondorf took a picture every mile, all 3,304
of them, until he reached San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The results can be viewed on the Web, at www.kodak.com
</P>
<P>
   /US/en/corp/features
</P>
<P>
   /onTheRoad. Looking at the pictures requires a Flash multimedia
plug-in, which can be downloaded from the site for free.
</P>
<P>
   Frondorf actually made the trip twice. He had to bring a tripod
and clamps that mounted the 35 mm camera to his passenger side
window. On the first pass, he brought a Porsche but not a
wide-angle lens. As a result, the Rocky Mountain stretch of
Interstate 70 included a lot of close-ups of rock walls. The
low-riding Porsche also created quite a few guardrail shots.
</P>
<P>
   The next trip was in June in a high-riding Ford Explorer.
Frondorf traveled mostly on older highways, including U.S. 30, U.S.
40 and U.S. 50. The trip took six days.
</P>
<P>
   Frondorf would stop when the natural light started to fade. He'd
mark his spot and look for a motel. He used a Canon T-90 with a
wide-angle lens and a motor drive. Shooting through the window
meant he did not run the air conditioning, so he kept the film in a
cooler. The shutter was triggered by a device hooked to the
odometer. Every time a mile passed, the shutter released.
</P>
<P>
   SITE COVERS CEREAL WITH SOME SOGGY PROSE
</P>
<P>
   If you love cereal _ and we're not talking old-fashioned Cream
of Wheat, we're talking dessert cereal _ consider www
</P>
<P>
   .emptybowl.com.
</P>
<P>
   The site is an invaluable resource to lovers of Cap'n Crunch,
Cocoa Puffs and Count Chocula _ name brands that are to breakfast
what the chalupa and the Big Mac are to lunch and dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The site features reviews. December's top 10 list is from Mike
D.
</P>
<P>
   Health Choice Mueslix was rated 10th for its ``good texture and
interesting extras like the proper use of dates.''
</P>
<P>
   Cinnamon Life was next, praised for its subtle sweetness but
marked down for getting soggy to soon. ``Still, the taste is
sassy.''
</P>
<P>
   Golden Grahams came in seventh, cited as ``tasty vittles that
work best with milk products.'' The review comes with this
advisory: ``Do NOT use Cherry Coke with syrup. Way too sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   Cocoa Puffs were next. They're considered a reliable replacement
to Count Chocula and come with a nice bonus: ``When the Count is
out of town and I need a different texture, Cocoa Puffs do the job.
They can also make some chocolate milk for you if you're out of
syrup.''
</P>
<P>
   The top-ranking cereal is a blast from the past: Kaboom. ``Some
people cry over old lovers. I cry over Kaboom! It was the
onomotopoeia of cereals. The milk would turn into some crazy color,
and the cereal was multicolored and marshmallow-filled. Plus, it
made its own gravy.''
</P>
<P>
   The site also includes a feature called ``Point Counterpoint.''
In the December offering, two staffers debate the virtues of skim
milk vs. 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A sample: Skim milk is not overpowering. It has the flavor of
milk but does not weigh down your meal. You can drink your cereal's
leftovers without the feeling of guilt. It gives you calcium while
not feeling like it's moving down your throat like some leftover
ooze from ``The Blob'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   A counterpoint: Skim milk? If you're going to use skim milk, why
not just use water? You get the same flavor. Once, during the week
when Will's sister was a vegetarian, she insisted on only drinking
skim milk. Once, when there wasn't any in the house and she was
yelling and complaining, Will took half a glass of whole milk and
filled the rest up with tap water. She drank it and said it tasted
great! Is that what you want on your cereal?

 &HT;    Compton's strong on basics, but hits a few wrong notes
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Compton's Encyclopedia 2000 is a handsome production,
easily navigated and full of information. Not all of it is good
information, but that is true of most encyclopedias.
</P>
<P>
   Every electronic encyclopedia I've examined, and that includes
virtually all of them, has its weak points and strong points. Like
most of them, Compton's is aimed at the elementary and secondary
school student.
</P>
<P>
   More attention is paid to things these students are apt to need
than to more arcane matters. I usually check on the treatment of a
lot of arcane stuff, and I'm usually disappointed. That situation
continues with Compton's.
</P>
<P>
   Flamenco receives its usual treatment _ that which you might
expect from a modern dance scholar who has barely heard of the
stuff. There is, however, a few seconds of flamenco guitar audio.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the articles are unsigned, and thus there is no one to
blame for this sentence in the article on shooting: ``The early
marksmen on the frontier, however, competed only with rifles
because they believed that accurate shooting with pistols and
revolvers required little or no skill.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the clueless would believe such a thing, and frontier
marksmen may have been unwashed, unkempt and even unlettered, but
as a class they were scarcely clueless.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, absent this blunder, the section on
marksmanship is surprisingly long, detailed, interesting and
lacking in political innuendo.
</P>
<P>
   Every encyclopedia has a time line, but I particularly enjoyed
Compton's. It is easy to browse, can be set up in different blocks
_ years, centuries and so forth _ and is quite detailed.
</P>
<P>
   The audio portions of the encyclopedia are the most amazingly
mixed bag I've encountered yet. On the good side, there's a lot of
it. Some of it is authentic. For instance, the little portion of
Dvorak's symphony ``From the New World'' is played by an orchestra
and not a synthesizer or MIDI instrument. The caption announced
that ``you can hear the music of the black American slaves on this
segment.''
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, you can't. This is the opening of the
symphony, not the ``Going Home'' portion that some argue was
inspired by spirituals.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart's ``Eine Kleine Nachtmusik'' gets orchestral treatment,
but I can't figure out what's happening in the opening theme of the
``Jupiter'' symphony; it sounds dimly like an orchestra, but
there's a piano in it. The famous ``Queen of the Night'' aria from
``Magic Flute,'' we are told, has ``some of the highest notes ever
written for soprano.'' It's a good thing for the kids that this is
pointed out, since there's no soprano to be heard. In fact, the
human voice is notably missing from all the music.
</P>
<P>
   I thought I was reasonably familiar with the work of Beethoven,
but here we are presented with something called ``Nature,'' without
opus number, played by a piano and what might be a hurdy-gurdy or
an abused cat. It is a marchlike affair, and if Beethoven wrote it
I doubt he would thank Compton's for resurrecting it.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pity that music is treated by most of the encyclopedias
in such a cavalier way, as it is one of the most important
advantages the electronic versions have over print.
</P>
<P>
   However, all this carping seems excessive when, according to the
publisher's Web site at www.shopmattel
</P>
<P>
   .com/, this two-disc encyclopedia can be ordered for $15.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of hundred movies and animations, including
some of those dandy 360-degree rotating scenes. One of them,
startlingly, is of the High Museum in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   For the intended audience of schoolchildren intent on subjects
like geography, science, social studies, history and the like,
there is more than enough here to see them through. Compton's seems
particularly strong on modern history, and there are several
thousand links to further information on the Web.

manipulated history to forge theater and cinema, the greatest of

then isn't it more or less the same thing when filmmakers do those
things today? A Critics Notebook. By Richard Bernstein.

 &HT;    U.S. frankness could help Africa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The attention Washington has focused on the AIDS calamity in
Africa during this, the month the United States chairs the U.N.
Security Council, is long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers from the biological battlefront south of the Sahara
are staggering: 14 million people dead so far, 23.3 million
infected, 11 million children orphaned by the disease. Life
expectancies in affected countries have plunged from 60 to 40 years
within a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Health experts worry that more people may die of AIDS in
tropical Africa in the coming decade than were killed in all the
wars around the world during the entire 20th century. The United
Nations does not exaggerate when it calls this ``the worst
infectious disease catastrophe since the bubonic plague,'' which
wiped out a fourth of Europe's population during the mid-1300s.
</P>
<P>
   But no one at last week's Security Council meeting on AIDS
needed a briefing on the casualty toll. What the diplomats wanted
to hear was what the United States, the richest and most
scientifically advanced nation, was going to do to help stem this
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore announced the Clinton administration is
pledging an additional $150 million, subject to congressional
approval, for HIV screening and prevention programs and for orphan
care. That's a fraction of what the United States spends to fight
AIDS here at home, but its contribution to Africa shouldn't be
dismissed as inconsequential.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS prevention measures do work. In Uganda and Senegal,
infection rates have dropped dramatically, thanks to candid
nationwide education programs.
</P>
<P>
   The more plain-speaking on this issue, the better. Gore engaged
in some of it himself in a Boston Globe interview urging African
cultural changes: the acceptance of sex education, the practice of
abstinence or of safe sex and the stigmatizing of promiscuity.
Coming from the American vice president, that's strong stuff.
African leaders too often resent frank talk on this subject, but
public awareness about how to stop the transmission of the HIV
virus is essential to their people's survival.
</P>
<P>
   Can the United States and other advanced countries do more? Yes,
there's a joint effort under way to develop an affordable AIDS
vaccine for distribution to poor nations in Africa and Asia, but
that may be years away. In the meantime, the most effective and
cheapest way to fight AIDS is to change the behaviors that
encourage its spread.

 &HT;    Coke's new president addresses upcoming changes in today's
meeting
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wall Street will be keeping an especially close eye on
Coca-Cola today as new company President Doug Daft attends his
first major board meeting since becoming a director last month.
</P>
<P>
   The board is expected to announce that Jack Stahl will become
president of the world's largest soft-drink company in April, when
Daft assumes the top spot of chairman and chief executive officer.
He'll replace M. Douglas Ivester, who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl, 46, is a 20-year company veteran. He is currently in
charge of operations in North America and Latin America, which
account for about half of the company's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect the board to discuss at least two other
important issues, with announcements possible later this week or
next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first board meeting where Daft and the new
management team will be presenting, reviewing and assessing the
year 2000 operating plans,'' said Andrew Conway, an analyst with
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   One key issue is whether to cut costs and how to do it. Analysts
said the company could decide to reduce the number of jobs at
corporate headquarters in Atlanta, as well as abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Daft and all the new group presidents will be
assessing what's adequate in terms of staffing and looking at where
they may be overstaffed,'' Conway said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said it is examining ``every aspect of
operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also expect the board to discuss whether the company
should write down the value of its bottling assets in Russia, where
economic instability has hurt sales. Coke has invested between $500
million and $700 million there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were to take the charge, it sends a signal that
soft-drink growth in the Russian market seems elusive,'' Conway
said.
</P>
<P>
   By taking a write-down and charge now, analysts said, Daft could
put the bad news behind him before he assumes the top spot in
April. Essentially, any fourth-quarter charge would be on Ivester's
watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clean-up time,'' said Manny Goldman, global beverage
analyst with Merrill Lynch. ``You want to go into the new year
pristine, from a financial standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is expected to announce fourth-quarter and annual
results by the end of the month. For the fourth quarter, most
analysts are predicting earnings of 28 cents to 30 cents a share,
excluding any one-time charges. That would compare with 24 cents a
share in 1998's fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   If the company takes a write-down now, depreciation costs would
be lower in subsequent quarters. That would help boost future
earnings, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's stock closed Friday at $61.06 1/4, up 50 cents.

 &HT;    BUSINESS MAGAZINES: AOL-Time Warner merger draws accolades from
Business Week
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The theme that dominated the business press in 1999 shows no
sign of disappearing in the early editions of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Business Week (Jan. 24) wasted no time awarding ``men of the
century'' accolades to two high tech leaders in a new century just
a few weeks old.
</P>
<P>
   The business weekly profiles America Online Chief Executive
Steve Case and President Robert Pittman, who last week announced
AOL's purchase of Time Warner in the biggest merger ever proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the ascendence of the Internet economy were not clear
enough already, the Jan. 10 announcement . . . should be taken as
proof positive,'' says Business Week.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine contends that Case, Pittman and Time Warner Chief
Executive Gerald Levin ``have a chance to reshape the world of
information and entertainment, digital or otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, this is also Business Week's annual mutual fund
report, which rates and ranks the performances of about 3,000
funds.
</P>
<P>
   In a case of deja vu, computer pioneer Steve Jobs and Apple
Computer seem to be leading the industry again, according to a
Fortune (Jan. 31) profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every PC manufacturer is trying to copy the iMac in one way or
another,'' Jobs says of the new Apple computer.
</P>
<P>
   His objective is to link the iMac and the Internet with a new,
easy-to-use system that will provide a wide variety of free Web
services for users.
</P>
<P>
   As for the surge in new Internet companies, Jobs says the
problem is not the number of businesses, but the number of
entrepreneurs who fail to stick with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when these people sell out, even though they get fabulously
rich, they're gypping themselves out of one of the potentially most
rewarding experiences of their unfolding lives,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Upside (February), a technology publication, warns that high
tech companies can no longer be politically aloof now that the
government has finally discovered technology.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine offers a guide to the ins and outs of doing
business in Washington, including a list of ``who you need to know
in D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   A new kind of supermarket
</P>
<P>
   For some investors, online mutual fund supermarkets such as
Charles Schwab and ETrade are the greatest invention since the
salad bar. But Working Mother (February) cautions individuals to be
careful, since ``one-stop, do-it-yourself shopping isn't right for
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But for those who meet the tests, these supermarkets ``let you
help yourself to hundreds of funds from a vast, diverse array.''

&HT;     SERVICE MARKS ANNIVERSARY OF CONTENTIOUS LESBIAN UNION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CAROL NESS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Two weeks before a hearing that could put
them on trial, a group of United Methodist ministers has publicly
reaffirmed their audacious blessing of a lesbian couple a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The service, held Saturday in Sacramento's Memorial Auditorium,
celebrated the anniversary of the ``holy union'' of Jeanne Barnett
and Ellie Charlton. It also cast a spotlight on the upcoming
hearing and on a California ballot initiative against gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here to honor Jeanne and Ellie, who stuck their necks
out last year and publicly proclaimed their love for each other in
the midst of a homophobic society,'' said the Rev. Don Fado, the
Sacramento pastor who led 67 other Methodist clergy in the ceremony
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are also here ... to make our statement to the world
again,'' added Fado, pastor at St. Mark's United Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   The union ceremony made national waves because of the number of
ministers who put their jobs on the line in opposing the Methodist
policy banning such blessings for same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   The action also divided the Methodist Church on the issue of
homosexuality. And it sparked a complaint against the 68 pastors,
all active and retired clergy in the California-Nevada Conference
of the United Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   While both the Sacramento-based conference and its bishop,
Melvin Talbert, are on record supporting full equality for
homosexual church members, the complaint launched legal proceedings
within the church that could lead to a mass trial.
</P>
<P>
   A three-day public hearing, by the church's Committee on
Investigation, starts Feb. 1 to determine whether formal charges
will be brought against the pastors, who now number 67 after the
death of one last August.
</P>
<P>
   Before Saturday's service, attended by 25 of the pastors plus
about 200 supporters, Fado said he hoped the hearing would provide
an opportunity for a ``full airing of the issues pro and con.''
</P>
<P>
   During the service, he spoke out strongly for full equality for
gays within the church, calling the position of the 68 pastors the
revolutionary equivalent of the Boston Tea Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's throw out all the T's,'' Fado said, including the ``T
for the totalitarianism that requires others to conform to any one
theology.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett and Charlton, in the twin purple appliqued sweaters they
wore for last year's ceremony, sat to the side and were applauded
by the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's service was a smaller, quieter version of the one
last year, featuring music, speeches, a procession by the pastors
and a poem and song written especially for the couple.
</P>
<P>
   Notaries were on hand to sign up couples as domestic partners
under the new state registry law. And opponents of the March ballot
initiative were gathering donations and seeking volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, Proposition 22, would outlaw state recognition
of gay marriages, should another state ever legalize them.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie McBride, a leading opponent of Proposition 22, exhorted
the audience to do everything in its power to fight what she called
``an insurance policy for bigotry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us honor this celebration by mobilizing ourselves as
lovers, gay and straight,'' McBride said.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing, Feb. 1-3, will draw experts on Methodist scripture,
traditions and ethics from around the country, according to the
Rev. Ron Swisher of Taylor Memorial United Methodist Church of
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Lay people and clergy from both sides of the issue will testify.
The 68 clergy have filed statements with the committee explaining
their actions as acts of conscience required by their Christian
beliefs, and some may also be called to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Swisher, chair of the Committee on Investigation, said the
hearing was highly unusual because of the number of pastors
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Once they've heard all the evidence, the seven clergy members on
the committee will vote on whether the pastors should undergo a
church trial. Punishment could include losing their ordination.
</P>
<P>
   A similar trial in Omaha cost Methodist Pastor Jimmy Creech his
calling, for violating a rule outlawing the blessing of same-sex
couples that the Methodist Church passed in 1998. Until then, it
was up to each minister.
</P>
<P>
   But Creech's trial took place in a different conference which,
unlike the California-Nevada one, did not support equal treatment
of homosexuals.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the years, researchers have found hundreds of drugs to slow
the growth of cancer. But they have found virtually nothing that
can prevent cancers from forming.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is not just a drug to stop cancerous cells from
growing. It must also be safe enough to be taken for years by
healthy people, most of whom will never get cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, scientists at the National Cancer Institute say
they have a promising candidate, an aspirinlike drug, known as a
selective cox-2 inhibitor, that is commonly used to treat arthritis
pain. By accident, scientists found that such drugs might also
prevent cancer.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether cox-2 inhibitors will actually
help prevent cancer. The path of medical history is littered with
the remains of promising compounds that turned out to be useless.
</P>
<P>
   But the story of how these drugs made their way to the forefront
of cancer research shows that serendipity and the chance
observations of an individual doctor can still change the course of
research, even in these days of high-tech drug design and
sophisticated genetics and molecular biology.
</P>
<P>
   The story is reaching its culmination now, with the unexpected
discovery of drugs that appear to selectively inhibit cox-2, an
enzyme involved in inflammation. Until recently, the only drugs
that blocked this enzyme also had a troublesome side effect. The
older drugs, which include aspirin and the anti-inflammatory drug
sulindac, can cause bleeding, particularly in the gastrointestinal
tract. But new cox-2 inhibitors are essentially free of this
problem.
</P>
<P>
   And so the cancer institute, working with Searle, is beginning
large studies involving thousands of Americans, asking whether
people at risk for cancers of the colon, skin, esophagus or bladder
can protect themselves by taking the new drugs. Merck is starting a
similar study on its own, with its cox-2 inhibitor, asking if it
can prevent colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The studies are not the first to look at drugs that prevent
cancer. The institute has studied beta-carotene and vitamin A, for
example, but has failed to find anti-cancer effects. It also has
another major prevention initiative under way, comparing two drugs,
tamoxifen and raloxifen, for the prevention of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Both drugs can block estrogen, which often promotes breast
cancer growth. But both drugs can also lead to potentially fatal
blood clots, and tamoxifen doubles a woman's risk of developing
uterine cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The cox-2 story is more of a medical mystery. In theory, it
makes little sense that blocking this enzyme should prevent cancer.
Scientists have competing hypotheses to explain it. But they also
have more than two decades of accumulating research, with animals,
with cells grown in the laboratory and with human populations, all
supporting the idea that blocking the cox-2 enzyme might prevent
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is crystallizing,'' said Dr. Marcia Bertagnolli, a
colon cancer specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in
Boston. ``What you really look for is that all the avenues of
information are giving you the same information. Not just the
epidemiology, not just the molecular biology, not just the
genetics. Everything is converging on the same answer.''
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers temper their enthusiasm with strong words of
caution. The only way to know if cox-2 inhibitors can prevent
cancers is to test them in large studies in which some people take
the drugs and others take a dummy medication for comparison.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, this story begins in the late 1970s, in the office of
Dr. William R. Waddell at the University of Colorado Health
Sciences Center in Denver. One of Waddell's patients had a rare
inherited condition known as familial adenomatous polyposis, or
FAP. People with FAP eventually develop hundreds or thousands of
polyps in their colons _ too many to excise one by one. Since colon
cancers start out as polyps, the only way to protect these patients
is to remove their colons.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell had removed the woman's colon when she was 23 but by
August 1978, at the age of 31, she had developed another common
consequence of FAP: noncancerous scarlike tumors in her abdomen. In
addition, polyps were starting to grow in her rectum and Waddell
expected that they would proliferate until she would have to have
her rectum removed as well. For the time being, however, Waddell
had to treat the tumors in her abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   He prescribed indomethacin, an anti-inflammatory drug that often
makes such tumors shrink. Two years later, in July 1980, the woman
began to complain that the drug upset her stomach, so Waddell
switched her prescription to another anti-inflammatory drug,
sulindac. To his amazement, the drug seemed to make the tumors
disappear. Year after year, she was polyp-free.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell decided to prescribe the drug for three of the woman's
relatives who also had the disease. One was a 21-year-old man whose
colon had been removed but who had 15 polyps in his rectum. Within
a year, he had none. Another, a 42-year-old man, had 50 polyps in
his colon when he began taking the drug. A year later, he had four
very small polyps. A 16-year-old girl had 25 polyps in her colon. A
year later she had three small ones.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell thought he had stumbled upon something amazing, but few
of his colleagues believed him and major medical journals rejected
his findings. He finally published them in The Journal of Surgical
Oncology in 1983. ``No one paid any attention to that paper,''
Waddell said.
</P>
<P>
   But he continued to give sulindac to patients with FAP, to
gather data and to publish results, though they got little
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few people believed it,'' said Dr. Bert Vogelstein, a
cancer researcher at the Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine. ``I was intrigued by it, but I asked my clinical
colleagues and they said it was unlikely to be valid.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But by 1989, Dr. Francis M. Giardiello, a colon cancer
specialist at Johns Hopkins, had heard of the sulindac findings and
decided to test them in 22 patients, 11 of whom took the drug and
11 a placebo. His results were not as striking as Waddell's:
patients who took sulindac had 44 percent fewer polyps after a year
and the diameters of their polyps had decreased by a third. No
patients saw all their polyps disappear. Still, Giardiello
considered the results ``astounding.''
</P>
<P>
   His paper was published on May 6, 1993, in The New England
Journal of Medicine; this time, the sulindac story got national
attention.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, Dr. Raymond N. DuBois, the director of the
cancer prevention program at Vanderbilt University Medical Center,
noticed studies indicating that people who used aspirin regularly
for, say, arthritis, contracted colon cancer at only about half the
rate of people over all.
</P>
<P>
   At first, he said, he and his colleagues doubted that the
finding was a matter of cause and effect. But the evidence
continued to accumulate. Some studies were enormous, like one
involving 104,217 elderly people who were part of the Tennessee
Medicaid program and a study of 47,900 health care workers.
</P>
<P>
   DuBois became so intrigued that he decided to test the idea that
anti-inflammatory drugs could inhibit colon cancer by testing cells
in the laboratory and by conducting studies in animals.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers took up the search, and more and more studies
were done. By now, said Dr. Ernest Hawk, who is chief of the
gastrointestinal cancer research group in the institute's division
of cancer prevention, about 50 studies show that blocking cox-2 can
prevent premalignant and malignant tumors in animals, and not just
colon cancers.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs appear effective for bladder, skin, and esophageal
cancers as well. All these cancers make greatly increased
quantities of cox-2. ``There are very consistent results across
investigators, across sites, across agents,'' Hawk said.
</P>
<P>
   But, Hawk said, until recently there were two problems with
taking the next step and testing the cox-2 hypothesis in large
groups of people at risk for these cancers: first, the only drugs
available then were ones, like aspirin or sulindac, that could
cause bleeding; and second, sulindac's patent had run out and
aspirin was sold over the counter, so drug companies had no
incentive to invest in research on them.
</P>
<P>
   The situation changed a few years ago with the discovery and
development of Celebrex by scientists at Searle. Like Merck, which
has a similar drug, Searle was interested in the compound because
it might help the huge group of arthritis patients who needed an
anti-inflammatory drug without gastrointestinal side effects.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists at the National Cancer Institute managed to pique
the interest of Dr. Philip Needleman, co-president of Searle, on
the compound's potential as a cancer preventive.
</P>
<P>
   Needleman decided to put the cox-2 hypothesis to a test, giving
the Searle drug to patients with FAP. If it squelched polyp
formation in these patients, he reasoned, it would make sense to go
on to test it in people in the general population who had had one
or two polyps _ and so were at risk for colon cancer. If it failed
in the FAP patients, Needleman said, ``we would have stopped all
trials of cox-2 in cancer.'' The study, he added, ``was the proof
of concept in every way.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted by Searle with the cancer institute,
included 83 patients and lasted six months. It found that patients
who took Celebrex had a 28 percent reduction in the number of
polyps, compared with a 5 percent reduction in those taking a
placebo. The Food and Drug Administration approved the drug late
last year for FAP patients.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators are continuing to study Celebrex to see if
cancers as well as polyps are prevented in FAP patients. In the
meantime, however, they stress that FAP patients will still need
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not good enough to replace surgery,'' said Dr.
Bertagnolli, the colon cancer specialist at Brigham and Women's
Hospital. Dr. Bertagnolli, who will lead the new study seeking to
prevent colon cancer in the general population, is also a
consultant to Searle.
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``Perhaps you can do a lesser surgery or perhaps you
can take a young person who has the gene and see if you can prevent
them from having polyps. We have 15- and 16-year-old kids with this
disease. They're in high school, they're trying to do sports. Maybe
you could give them a few years.''
</P>
<P>
   For Needleman, the important thing now is to conduct studies of
people in the general population at high risk of cancers of the
colon, bladder, skin or esophagus. But he and Hawk of the cancer
institute say they have one big concern: people will refuse to
enter trials because they will want to start taking cox-2
inhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't do anybody any good if they're overzealous,''
Needleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Hawk agreed. ``We feel it's important to get answers by science,
not by personal opinion,'' he said.

TRUE SECRET   OF DIETS: CALORIES COUNT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Vt.)   (Science Times)  
(DW) 
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of my most vivid childhood memories is a diet _ not for me
but for my father. Year after year he would take it up, poring over
a few sheets of typed instructions given to him by a family doctor,
the ancient and rail thin Dr. M.D. Levin of Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Levin's diet was supposed to cure ulcers and prevent migraines,
to give you energy and robust health. But, most important, to make
you lose weight. It was a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet, not
so different from the diets sweeping the country today. You load up
on meats and cut all the good stuff, like pasta and bread and
dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Levin's diet was not the way my father wanted to eat. But, he
insisted, it took the weight off. Of course, it always came back,
but that was because my father could not live like Levin and
Levin's equally skinny wife, forever on the diet.
</P>
<P>
   I had faith that Levin knew what he was talking about. But that
was decades ago, when I never thought to ask for evidence. Now, as
everyone around me goes on high-protein diets, I ask a different
question. If these diets, waxing and waning in popularity for
nearly 140 years, are so great, why are so many people fat?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I've heard the testimonials. Who hasn't? USA Today started
its Page 1 article on Sept. 21 with a dieter who ``had two eggs and
eight strips of bacon for breakfast, smoked ribs and pork rinds for
lunch and two quarter-pound cheeseburgers (no buns) and pork rinds
for dinner.'' He lost 100 pounds. Time offered a similar account in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Science Times published an essay by a reporter who
had lost 28 pounds much the same way.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to avoid being swept away by such powerful stories.
The disclaimers of scientists and nutritionists that often
accompany the glowing articles on high-protein diets can look like
the pedantic grumbling of professional naysayers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in all the enthusiasm over these diets the fact remains
that their very basis was disproved years ago. But the promoters
take another tack.
</P>
<P>
   Some say their diets attack the very cause of obesity, which
they say is carbohydrates. Dr. Barry Sears, who created the Zone
diet, puts it this way: ``too much carbohydrate means too much
insulin, and too much insulin takes you out of the Zone. Out of the
Zone, you put on excess body fat and you can't get rid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth? Alas, there are no magical foods to make you gain or
lose weight. All that matters is calories. It makes no difference
if those calories are in fats or vegetables or cake or ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence? It includes a paper published in 1992 in The
American Journal of Clinical Nutrition by Dr. Rudolph L. Leibel,
Dr. Jules Hirsch and colleagues at Rockefeller University. They put
people on a metabolic ward where they could precisely control every
calorie consumed. The subjects were on diets with widely different
compositions, fat contents ranging from 0 to 70 percent. It made no
difference. All that mattered to their weight was number of
calories consumed.
</P>
<P>
   Other proponents of high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets claim
that they work because they make you lose your cravings for food.
Dr. Robert C. Atkins, who, like Levin, claims his diet can
alleviate many ills as well as make you thin, explains the theory
on his Web site: ``The biggest battle that most people have with
weight loss is the constant obsession with food,'' he writes. The
reason, he adds, is ``blood sugar fluctuations that are aggravated
by carbohydrate consumption (especially the refined kind).'' But on
his diet, which cuts out carbohydrates, Atkins concludes, ``no more
false hunger pains.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth? Some studies say that no matter what diet, you will
feel great at first and report that hunger pangs are disappearing.
Then, as time wears on, hunger will come roaring back.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence? It includes a paper, published in The American
Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 1985 by Dr. James C. Rosen of the
University of Vermont, Dr. Ethan A.H. Sims, an emeritus professor
there, and colleagues. In the study, some obese patients went on a
low-carbohydrate diet and then a high-carbohydrate diet and others
had the diets in the reverse order. The investigators wrote: ``the
initial two weeks of dieting was associated with a decrease in
appetite and elevation of psychological well-being, regardless of
the composition of the diet.''
</P>
<P>
   But, ``Thereafter, appetite and mood approached basal levels.
Further changes in these psychological reactions to dieting did not
vary with the type of diet.''
</P>
<P>
   But I suspect that few want to hear these snippets of real
evidence. The testimonials are so much more compelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are desperate,'' Hirsch said. He is tired of seeing the
same useless remedies resurface every few decades only to fade away
while the next diet fad preys on people's unawareness of what
science has learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call this alchemy,'' Hirsch said. ``It's making gold out of
ignorance.''

<P>
   There are many incompetent people in the world. Dr. David A.
Dunning is haunted by the fear he might be one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Dunning, a professor of psychology at Cornell, worries about
this because, according to his research, most incompetent people do
not know that they are incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary. People who do things badly, Dunning has found
in studies conducted with a graduate student, Justin Kruger, are
usually supremely confident of their abilities _ more confident, in
fact, than people who do things well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to think that there were probably lots of things that
I was bad at and I didn't know it,'' Dunning said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that the ignorant also tend to be the blissfully
self-assured, the researchers believe, is that the skills required
for competence often are the same skills necessary to recognize
competence.
</P>
<P>
   The incompetent, therefore, suffer doubly, they suggested in a
paper appearing in the December issue of the Journal of Personality
and Social Psychology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do they reach erroneous conclusions and make
unfortunate choices, but their incompetence robs them of the
ability to realize it,'' wrote Kruger, now an assistant professor
at the University of Illinois, and Dunning.
</P>
<P>
   This deficiency in ``self-monitoring skills,'' the researchers
said, helps explain the tendency of the humor-impaired to persist
in telling jokes that are not funny, of day traders to repeatedly
jump into the market _ and repeatedly lose out _ and of the
politically clueless to continue holding forth at dinner parties on
the fine points of campaign strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Some college students, Dunning said, evince a similar blindness:
after doing badly on a test, they spend hours in his office,
explaining why the answers he suggests for the test questions are
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of studies, Kruger and Dunning tested their theory
of incompetence. They found that subjects who scored in the lowest
quartile on tests of logic, English grammar and humor were also the
most likely to ``grossly overestimate'' how well they had
performed.
</P>
<P>
   In all three tests, subjects' ratings of their ability were
positively linked to their actual scores. But the lowest-ranked
participants showed much greater distortions in their
self-estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to evaluate their performance on the test of logical
reasoning, for example, subjects who scored only in the 12th
percentile guessed that they had scored in the 62nd percentile, and
deemed their overall skill at logical reasoning to be at the 68th
percentile.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, subjects who scored at the 10th percentile on the
grammar test ranked themselves at the 67th percentile in the
ability to ``identify grammatically correct standard English,'' and
estimated their test scores to be at the 61st percentile.
</P>
<P>
   On the humor test, in which participants were asked to rate
jokes according to their funniness (subjects' ratings were matched
against those of an ``expert'' panel of professional comedians),
low-scoring subjects were also more apt to have an inflated
perception of their skill. But because humor is idiosyncratically
defined, the researchers said, the results were less conclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their unskilled counterparts, the most able subjects in
the study, Kruger and Dunning found, were likely to underestimate
their own competence. The researchers attributed this to the fact
that, in the absence of information about how others were doing,
highly competent subjects assumed that others were performing as
well as they were _ a phenomenon psychologists term the ``false
consensus effect.''
</P>
<P>
   When high scoring subjects were asked to ``grade'' the grammar
tests of their peers, however, they quickly revised their
evaluations of their own performance. In contrast, the
self-assessments of those who scored badly themselves were
unaffected by the experience of grading others; some subjects even
further inflated their estimates of their own abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incompetent individuals were less able to recognize competence
in others,'' the researchers concluded.
</P>
<P>
   In a final experiment, Dunning and Kruger set out to discover if
training would help modify the exaggerated self-perceptions of
incapable subjects. In fact, a short training session in logical
reasoning did improve the ability of low-scoring subjects to assess
their performance realistically, they found.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, the psychologists said, support Thomas Jefferson's
assertion that ``he who knows best knows how little he knows.''
</P>
<P>
   And the research meshes neatly with other work indicating that
overconfidence is a common; studies have found, for example, that
the vast majority of people rate themselves as ``above average'' on
a wide array of abilities _ though such an abundance of talent
would be impossible in statistical terms. And this overestimation,
studies indicate, is more likely for tasks that are difficult than
for those that are easy.
</P>
<P>
   Such studies are not without critics. Dr. David C. Funder, a
psychology professor at the University of California at Riverside,
for example, said he suspected that most lay people had only a
vague idea of the meaning of ``average'' in statistical terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure the average person thinks of `average' or
`percentile' in quite that literal a sense,'' Funder said, ``so
`above average' might mean to them `pretty good,' or `OK,' or
`doing all right.' And if, in fact, people mean something
subjective when they use the word, then it's really hard to
evaluate whether they're right or wrong using the statistical
criterion.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dunning said his current research and past studies indicated
that there were many reasons why people would tend to overestimate
their competency, and not be aware of it.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, Dunning pointed out, an awareness of one's own
inability is inevitable: ``In a golf game, when your ball is
heading into the woods, you know you're incompetent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in other situations, feedback is absent, or at least more
ambiguous; even a humorless joke, for example, is likely to be met
with polite laughter. And faced with incompetence, social norms
prevent most people from blurting out ``You stink!'' _ truthful
though this assessment may be.
</P>
<P>
   All of which inspired in Dunning and his co-author, in
presenting their research to the public, a certain degree of
nervousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This article may contain faulty logic, methodological errors
or poor communication,'' they cautioned in their journal report.
``Let us assure our readers that to the extent this article is
imperfect, it is not a sin we have committed knowingly.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Plug Power, a two-year-old startup company with
no marketable product and mounting losses, has made millions for
investors and generated real buzz on Wall Street. And it's not even
a dot-com.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock, which hit the street at $15 per share in
October, was trading at $55 at the close of business Friday _ a 267
percent increase. It reached a high of $79 per share Jan. 7 after
mentions in Business Week and on Microsoft Corp.'s Money Central
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The Latham-based company is poised to produce the first compact,
affordable fuel cell to power homes. That is a product some company
investors and industry analysts predict will be as widespread one
day as personal computers are now. The General Electric Co.
estimates the fuel-cell market to be a ``multibillion-dollar
opportunity by 2010,'' said GE spokeswoman Janice Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the ``PG'' _ personal generator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attention that Plug has gotten has certainly sparked
interest in the (fuel cell) sector, and probably gotten some other
people that are not publicly traded thinking about it,'' said
Samuel Brothwell, who follows the electric industry for Merrill
Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   The stock is making some executives wealthier, including Plug
Power President Gary Mittleman; board director Walter Robb, a
former GE executive; and George C. McNamee, who is chairman of Plug
Power, chief executive officer of Latham-based Mechanical
Technology Inc. and co-chairman of investment banking firm First
Albany Cos., which owns a large stake in Mechanical Technology Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Plug Power was founded by Mechanical Technology, a maker of
precision instruments for industrial and aviation markets, and the
Edison Development Corp., an affiliate of Detroit Edison,
Michigan's largest electric utility. It plans to have a
dishwasher-size fuel cell on the market next year, and eventually
to sell them for $3,000 to $5,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel cells take hydrogen from another fuel source, such as
natural gas, and convert it into electricity. The result is power
that's more environmentally friendly than current sources: the only
byproducts are heat and water.
</P>
<P>
   While the technology underlying fuel cells has been around for
more than 150 years, only recently have researchers believed the
devices could be made affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Current trends in the electric industry also are making it a
good time to be a fuel-cell developer. Nationally, the $220 billion
industry is undergoing deregulation, which means that consumers
will increasingly be comparing power options rather than just
signing up with their local utility monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   And the need for dependable power has become more critical as
homes and businesses become ever more reliant on computer
technology _ increasing the pain of a short blackout from mere
nuisance to minor catastrophe, Brothwell said.
</P>
<P>
   That has more consumers and businesses looking for backup power
sources.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, fuel cells could be cost-effective in 16
to 17 states where electricity rates are high, according to a
report on Plug Power from investment banking firm Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Internationally, the market may even be wider, Merrill Lynch's
Brothwell said. In countries where the electric grid is spotty,
people and businesses in poorly covered areas may be willing to pay
a premium for fuel cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real opportunity is perhaps outside the U.S.,'' Brothwell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanical Technology and Edison Development were not the only
ones to see this burgeoning market when they established Plug Power
in June 1997. But the company is seen as the most likely to get a
residential fuel cell to market first, something seen as critical
to its success. Canadian-based Ballard Power Systems is closer to
getting a fuel cell into cars. Spokane, Wash.-based Avista Labs is
working on a similar product as Plug Power's, but Goldman Sachs
believes the company has no distribution partner.
</P>
<P>
   Plug Power's distribution partner, on the other hand, is GE,
whose brand and powerful marketing muscle span the globe. Brothwell
said the partnership gives Plug Power ``instant credibility'' among
both investors and future customers.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS. &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GE Power Systems of Schenectady, which has been broadening its
range of power equipment under the division's president, Robert
Nardelli, looked at other fuel-cell developers before investing in
Plug Power, Smith said. Plug Power's proximity to GE Power Systems'
headquarters and GE's Research and Development Center in Niskayuna
were part of the reason the multinational company chose the Latham
company, Smith said. But the main reason was that it appeared to be
ahead of competitors in its likelihood of getting a new appliance
in the hands of consumers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   GE invested $37.5 million in the company, for a 12 percent
stake, according to Goldman Sachs. Nardelli also joined Plug
Power's board.
</P>
<P>
   Another Plug Power strength mentioned by investors and analysts
is its management team's ability to combine technological know-how
with a solid sense of the market. Unlike some scientifically
oriented companies, Plug Power has always had an eye on what
consumers would want, and has developed demonstration models even
as it continues to refine its research.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came up with a desire of what they wanted to have when
they were finished, and then they are taking the technology and
developing it to meet the constraints of the marketplace,'' said
Lee Stewart, president of the energy transportation services unit
at Southern California Gas Co., which invested $7.5 million in Plug
Power last April.
</P>
<P>
   The company has stocked its board with prominent business and
government leaders, like Nardelli, Robb, Detroit Edison Chairman
Anthony F. Earley Jr. and retired Army Gen. John M. Shalikashvili,
former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   The management team, led by former Edison Development Corp.
executive Mittleman, does face some challenges in merging its
high-tech vision with marketplace realities.
</P>
<P>
   Plug Power's price projections rely on reduced production costs
and increased demand for its fuel cells over time. When its fuel
cell hits the market next year, it could cost $7,000 to $10,000,
according to Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the predicted demand, the company also will have to
change its primary focus from research to manufacturing. With that
will come a rapid increase in staff at a company that has already
grown since June 1997 from 22 to more than 325 employees.
</P>
<P>
   It also has some technological hurdles, not all within its
control. While Plug Power may get its fuel cells to market, those
operating on natural gas or propane also require a processor that
separates the hydrogen from other components of the fuel. The
company is working with developers of such processors.
</P>
<P>
   And it will likely continue to post losses _ and need more cash
to keep operating. Goldman Sachs estimates the company's losses,
already topping $30 million, will pile up through 2004 and that
Plug Power will need another $400 million in funding by then.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts watching the company nonetheless believe it has an
excellent chance of meeting these challenges in an industry that
will become increasingly prominent in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   That certainly has some investors pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sit and watch and we're pleasantly surprised that the
market is taking notice,'' Stewart said. ``It's real fun to
watch.''

&HT;     TV DRAMAS BEND TO GOVERNMENT AND BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TIM GOODMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ If you're watching ``Stark Raving Mad'' on
NBC _ and millions of people apparently are _ there can be only one
reason: You must be high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kick the habit of ludicrously bad television. Just say no!
This message brought to you by the U.S. government.''
</P>
<P>
   If only the office of the drug czar were this straightforward
about its involvement in prime-time television _ instead of
script-doctoring over drug issues _ then it's something we could
get behind. Teach us lessons that are actually of use to us! For
example, a character on ``Once and Again'' could remark: ``We're in
our 40s, gorgeous, middle class and we both have flat stomachs. Why
are we whining and acting like our lives are difficult?''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of government interference could actually help people.
</P>
<P>
   The other kind of interference _ in case you've missed the TV
scandal of the moment _ centers on whether networks are dodging
their public service requirements by taking those just-say-no
messages out of commercials and putting them in the story lines of
``ER'' and other popular shows.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the government _ which allegedly gets to see the
scripts and offer advice _ absolves them of their social duty and
the networks can then sell that very expensive commercial time to
some dot-com company for huge profit.
</P>
<P>
   (Remember when parents were worried their children would hear
Satanic messages if they played their pop music backward? Now
parents are worried the government will recruit their kids to be
Washington interns if they watch ``The West Wing.'')
</P>
<P>
   This latest scandal is disturbing but not so surprising if you
know how TV works. Of course, the average person doesn't _ you have
better things to do with your time. So it may be easy to work up a
First Amendment snit or at least some kind of Big Brother
objection.
</P>
<P>
   But before you get all vexed about the sanctity of the airwaves,
remember this: Television does not have a soul. It never has.
Television is a for-profit business, and like military vendors and
toilet seat makers before them, it has often struck gold by shaking
hands with Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   Let's play a quick, painless numbers game: The government took
$1 billion of your tax dollars and told the broadcast networks,
``We want to buy advertising time.'' The networks said, ``Get in
line.'' The government said, ``Because we could regulate you into
the ground _ and because the airwaves are public _ we think you
should give us back something in return.''
</P>
<P>
   A deal was struck. The networks would provide $2 billion in
advertising time for that $1 billion in tax money. It was a
two-for-one that pleased both sides (but probably not you, if you
had been asked in advance).
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the line, the government's drug czar decided
that teens tune out public service announcements and it might make
a bigger impression if George Clooney, say, or somebody on
``Dawson's Creek,'' waves off a bong-load of top-shelf pot.
</P>
<P>
   The networks said, ``Oh, we do that kind of story all the
time.'' (Which is true.) So good many of them didn't have to air
public service announcements and hence, essentially, got your tax
money for free.
</P>
<P>
   It was stealing money, not brainwashing. A backroom deal, yes.
</P>
<P>
   But a plot that will lead to government propaganda spewed via
``Ally McBeal?'' _ no.
</P>
<P>
   The networks may seem dumb, but they know you're smarter than
all these watchdog groups give you credit for. If, for example,
some of the questions on ``Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'' focused
on campaign finance reform _ clearly you'd know the fix was in.
</P>
<P>
   Big Brother doctoring scripts and controlling your mind would be
a great story, but the reality is far duller. It's simply Hollywood
selling out _ which it does every day.
</P>
<P>
   Special interest groups of all kinds read scripts in advance on
a regular basis. They ``advise.'' It's business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Two much more alarming revelations came out Friday. The
government giving the thumbs-up to story lines that show kids why
it's bad to be a crack-head is less dangerous than the following:
</P>
<P>
   First, Peter Roth, president of Warner Bros. Television admitted
the studio was compensated in some manner for product placement and
gratuitous mentions of Pottery Barn in a recent episode of
``Friends.'' Subliminal is wasn't: The characters mentioned the
store name frequently and they obsessed about a particular table _
which just happens to appear in the latest Pottery Barn catalog you
got in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Donald Vereen, the deputy director at the government's
drug czar office (officially called the White House Office of
National Drug Control Policy, if you're wondering why it's always
shortened) came here to the TV critics mid-season press tour to
tout a study that said _ surprise _ illicit drug depiction on
network television is almost non-existent.
</P>
<P>
   Vereen, and the people who did the study, were proud. The study
looked at 168 episodes of 42 top-rated dramas and sitcoms. These
included the 20 most popular shows among white, African American
and Hispanic teens.
</P>
<P>
   That's the core target in the campaign against drugs. And the
study found that illicit drugs were in only 3 percent of all
episodes (great!), tobacco in 19 percent (pretty good!) and alcohol
in 71 percent (whoops!).
</P>
<P>
   But nobody seemed at all worried about the alcohol part. Even
though Vereen said illicit drugs kill about 20,000 people in the
country, alcohol _ ``many, many times more.'' Next question.
</P>
<P>
   As you know, those who produce illicit drugs can't advertise on
TV. Neither can tobacco companies. But alcohol _ it's a television
staple. Don't look for the networks to partner with the government
any time soon, overtly or covertly, on an anti-drinking campaign.
Uncle Sam doesn't buy enough ad time to compete with beer
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Just another lesson in how TV really works.
</P>

   DALLAS _ ``Today is going to be a weird day.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at a long wooden desk in a classroom at the Lincoln
Instructional Center, George Dawson copies this sentence, the
original having been written by his teacher, Carl Henry, on the
same page.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson's hand is slow and steady, and his penmanship is careful,
spidery. All things considered, he's doing remarkably well: Dawson
turns 102 years old Tuesday. He began learning how to read only
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And, even more remarkably, on Feb. 2, Random House will publish
his first book, ``Life Is So Good,'' co-authored by Washington
state elementary school teacher Richard Glaubman. The size of the
first printing, 100,000 copies, hints at hopes for the bestseller
list. Publicity manager Liz Fogarty calls the book ``one of our
lead titles for the spring.''
</P>
<P>
   This is all a bit unexpected for a man who, at age 98, just
wanted to learn to read his Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson's late pursuit of education and his remarkable life _
laying railroad tracks in East Texas before the Depression, riding
bulls, raising seven children, outliving several wives, witnessing
the horrors of racism firsthand _ sound like the stuff of
bestsellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is So Good'' opens with Dawson, at age 10, watching the
lynching of a 17-year-old farm worker named Pete in downtown
Marshall, a memory he no longer wishes to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   A Fort Worth Star-Telegram article in January 1998 led to
Dawson's appearance on ``Oprah,'' a story in ``People'' magazine
and eventually brought a Washington teacher to his door with dreams
of a book.
</P>
<P>
   Glaubman first heard of Dawson in February 1998. He showed the
newspaper article to his class of fourth-graders and, seeing their
interest, thought the story might make a good children's book.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson agreed, opening his small house to the stranger from
Washington, letting him live there during interviews because
Glaubman didn't have money for hotels.
</P>
<P>
   At Dawson's age, it's hard to change your routine. So Glaubman
quickly got used to talking with Dawson as the sun was rising.
Dawson's prescription for living is this: waking every day at 5
a.m., making a cup of hot chocolate, eating two pieces of bread
folded over and drinking a glass of hot water.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he's off to school _ his teacher picks him up every
weekday morning and drops him off every afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson lets little interfere with his commitment to learning:
The only three days he's missed school since he started at Lincoln
Instructional in December 1996 have been to attend funerals.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson may be on the cusp of being America's hot new author, but
he is a proud man first. He still makes his own biscuits and corn
bread, offers a firm handshake and walks without help. Don't offer
any or you'll insult him, Henry says.
</P>
<P>
   A doff of his hat reveals a full head of gray hair, neatly
parted. He always wears a hat because ``I don't like the cold wind
blowing through my hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaubman remembers well their first encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some misconceptions about age, so I didn't expect this
very healthy man with this strong voice. He was doing just fine. He
had a memory as good as anybody's could be, and he was so at peace
with himself and what he was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Glaubman realized that a children's book couldn't
capture all of George. During those crack-of-dawn encounters, ``I'd
say, `Tell me more about this,' and one story would lead to
another. I wouldn't know what I was missing until I got back up
here; the questions would pile up. And I'd go back down. New things
always came up. I didn't have an outline. I didn't know where it
was going.''
</P>
<P>
   But the story emerged. Dawson, born in a log cabin in Marshall
in East Texas, was the oldest child and had to help support his
family. He didn't have time to go to school. His grandmother taught
him slave songs, which he can still sing in a clear, strong voice
if asked. He built levees, played baseball, and rambled from Canada
to Mexico to St. Louis to New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he settled down and worked for 20 years at Oak Farms
Dairy, where he once had a shot at a promotion. But he couldn't
write his name, and the job went to a man who could.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing my name _ that was one of the grandest things I
learned,'' he says now, his eyes shining, his smile widening. ``I
like to talk about what the people did for me and what I did for
myself. I didn't know how to write my name. I wrote X's. That was
my name for 100 years, that X. That was all I had.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Glaubman pitched his original concept, a children's
book, to publishing houses _ without much luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was OK,'' he said. ``But by the time I was done I realized
there was a lot missing. (Dawson) and his son saw a story that
would be uplifting to people in the community and kids in junior
high, the kids most in need of help.''
</P>
<P>
   Children are, without question, Dawson's main concern. Ask him
what you will, but probably sooner than later he will steer the
conversation back to children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want 'em to remember this old man here,'' Dawson said,
tapping the cover of his book. ``He lived and died and done
everything he could to help the little ones. I loved every little
kid. I tell the kids, `If you go to school, you'll learn
something.' Kids don't want to; they don't treat their parents
right. I don't know what the world have come to.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has some criticism for parents.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   ``(There are) so many children without fathers,'' he said. ``If
someone could get it in their mind to sit down and watch children
and don't ever hit him on his head. I tell 'em all that. I never
was hit on the head; I never forgot nothin'. Every man should be at
home with his child, let him know what home is. Teach him the good
side of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaubman eventually connected with an agent, Harriet Wasserman,
in March 1999, sending her a portion of the book that would become
``Life.'' She sold it to Random House about three weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was totally in shock,'' Glaubman said. ``For about four days
I couldn't write.''
</P>
<P>
   All the attention pleases Dawson, but not so much that he
doesn't want to get back into Henry's classroom. He smiles shyly,
allows that he doesn't know any other 102-year-old first-time
authors, and says the book is ``fine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something I didn't have no idea what it was going to
be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His teacher, Henry, calls him an excellent student.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in the fifth-grade reading book; when he goes home, he
reads the Bible. He was given a Bible when he was on `Oprah,' but
he still reads his own, I think,'' Henry said.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson doesn't much think about how much longer he has: waste of
time, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could put remembrance in front of you, it's lots behind
you that you learned,'' he said. ``I think the world ought to be
better. Back in them days, I'd say, `Loan me $10 and I'll pay you
tomorrow.' And the next day I'd have his $10. A promise back in
them days was something you could keep. My life been a good life
all my life. I have rambled from place to place. I've enjoyed my
life. The world don't owe me nothin', not nothin'. A good life is
worth living.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the interview is over. Dawson accompanies a photographer
out into the cold air for a few minutes, then comes back inside,
walking down the hallway to the classroom, where those lines Henry
wrote await.
</P>
<P>
   As people gather outside the room to talk about him, he gets
back to work. He has a lot to do before it's time to return home,
read his Bible, sleep and get up before dawn breaks.

FREED SLAVES IN AFRICA, TEXAS, MOURN TOWN'S DISAPPEARANCE

   AFRICA, Texas _ Mist floats among the pine boughs on cloudy days
in Africa, Texas, a poor, rural unincorporated community tucked in
the state's eastern Piney Woods. Even the town's history and name
are foggy, and, like the mist, are likely to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young ones, they don't even call it Africa anymore,'' says
Addie B. Clifton, 88, a woman born here and raised with nine
siblings in a four-room house of not much more than 600 square
feet. ``They are going to lose all memory of it. And that's so
sad,'' Clifton says.
</P>
<P>
   Africa _ also known as Webb, after an early property owner, or
St. John's, after Africa's Baptist Church _ is in deep East Texas
by the Louisiana border, where the culture of the Deep South
spreads across the state line like roots flourishing under the
shade of the thick pine forests.
</P>
<P>
   The town's history is largely unwritten, its tales untold. Freed
slaves with a dream of a new home founded Africa 135 years ago. But
their stories settled into the deep thickets and finally
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 people live in Africa, which, according to Clifton, is
not much more or less than the population has ever been. They drive
into the nearby town of Center, population 4,950, to socialize or
to work at the Bruce Hardwood Floors plant, or at Wal-Mart or one
of the other retail outlets, supplementing the money they make
cutting timber. Many planned to make the drive Monday, to join the
200 or so people at Center's annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day
march.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to Center, the folks from Africa drive along Shelby
County Road 2050 and onto Martin Luther King Drive, the road that
used to be called Neuville Road. Some people still call it Neuville
Road, even in telephone book listings, because they were opposed to
changing the name to MLK Drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the old (African-American) folks here just didn't want
to change it,'' says Eddie Logan, 70, a deacon at St. John Baptist
Church in Africa. ``They just wanted things the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Change has been slow to come to Africa and its environs, which
have long been neutral ground.
</P>
<P>
   In 1806, the region was declared a no man's land, where no one
was supposed to live or lay claim to land until the United States
and Spanish-ruled Texas could settle a border dispute. History
books say most people passed through the area on their way to the
open plains. By 1819, the dispute was settled and the Sabine River
was designated the boundary between Louisiana and Texas. Although
it was legal again to live in the region, only a few planters were
attracted to clear the forests.
</P>
<P>
   When the Civil War ended in 1865, freed slaves established
communities throughout the South. A few found their way to this
place, started homes and farms, and named it Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In Logan's possession is a ledger that lists long-ago members of
the church in Africa. The first entry in the book of now-crumbling
pages is dated 1894. The Texas State Historical Association says
the once-thriving farming and poultry-raising community consisted
of a 2-story town hall, a gristmill, a syrup mill and three stores.
</P>
<P>
   Clifton attended school in Africa. The school building is
abandoned now, just the tip of its tin roof poking out of the
pines. Years ago, much of the land was cleared. But the
fast-growing pines have grown thick, covering up remnants of a life
that used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Clifton recently brought a visitor back to her now-abandoned
childhood home. The floors of the two bedrooms sag with the weight
of the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Addie, how did 10 children all fit in here?'' the visitor
asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``And why wouldn't they?'' Clifton says. ``It's what we had.''
</P>
<P>
   The family ate whatever they could grow, Clifton says. They had
no telephones or televisions, just the church down the street. Her
father ran a small store near the family home, mostly selling goods
to children who attended the nearby school.
</P>
<P>
   Clifton and her husband lived in Africa for many years, raising
Black Angus cattle. She taught school and also worked in a
social-service program in Center. Clifton eventually moved to
Center, mostly because the region's rainfall averages 50 inches a
year, turning Africa's unpaved roads into impassable mud.
</P>
<P>
   The remains of old vacant buildings still stand, scattered among
the pines. A few houses are here and there, a few mobile homes have
been moved in. But there isn't much else.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the children raised here) just moved on to better
things,'' says Clifton, whose siblings live in Houston, Beaumont
and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   And that may be because life on the unpaved roads in Africa,
Texas, is unglamorous enough that it's easiest just to forget it,
to give it some new name, let the past erase itself. Or maybe it's
easier to move far away to Dallas or Houston or any place where
your parents didn't have to keep weeding out those pesky yellow
pines sprouting up in land that needed to be cleared just to raise
enough to eat.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``old home place,'' as Clifton calls the abandoned
family home, is where the family still gathers once a summer for a
reunion. About 200 people come back to Africa to celebrate. And
then they leave the old house in the pines to sit there untouched
for another year, a memorial to a time gone by.

AFRICA, Texas: gone by. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOWN'S PAST LIES BURIED
</P>
<P>
   Clyde Lister, 68, lives in Africa, as he has for about 30 years,
but works in a mortuary in Center on Martin Luther King Drive. In
the 1960s, during the civil-rights movement, Lister and Logan say
they admired King and his work from a distance. Logan recalls being
asked by a friend to go to one of the protests and marches taking
place in the South's larger towns and cities. So does Lister.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had jobs and families to watch out for, so we just didn't
get involved,'' says Lister.
</P>
<P>
   The two say that back then, they worried about a backlash from
the white community or from members of the black community who
didn't feel comfortable openly supporting King.
</P>
<P>
   These days, though, they march.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the marches today are celebrations of King and his good
work. They aren't protests,'' Logan said.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither grew up in Africa, both married women who did.
</P>
<P>
   Logan says it's sad that there isn't a written history of even
the names of the people who first had a dream of Africa, Texas.
Logan has the ledger from the church and some photographs, but he
does not have the names of the first folks who came here. He
doesn't know where they lived before the Civil War. He does know
that the Goodwin and Goodwyn families were early settlers. But the
church and the tombstones dating to the 1890s hold the only clues
to the names of those who came before. And the stories of slavery
and pre-slavery? Stories of ancestors' memories of the real Africa?
Those are long buried.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few reminders of Africa's past is the bell in front
of St. John Baptist Church. Long before the arrival of telephones,
its distinctive ring signaled a death in the community _ first one
pull, then a pause, then another pull.
</P>
<P>
   Logan wants to gather enough history to put it on a plaque
mounted near the bell. It could be a memorial to Africa's founders,
he said. Maybe someday. Logan went to the bell in Africa on New
Year's Eve and gave it a couple of slow rings.

   Logan says it's sad that there isn't a written history of even
the names of the people who first had a dream of Africa, Texas.
Logan has the ledger from the church and some photographs, but he
does not have the names of the first folks who came here. He
doesn't know where they lived before the Civil War. He does know
that the Goodwin and Goodwyn families were early settlers. But the
church and the tombstones dating to the 1890s hold the only clues
to the names of those who came before. And the stories of slavery
and pre-slavery? Stories of ancestors' memories of the real Africa?
Those are long buried.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few reminders of Africa's past is the bell in front
of St. John Baptist Church. Long before the arrival of telephones,
its distinctive ring signaled a death in the community _ first one
pull, then a pause, then another pull.
</P>
<P>
   Logan wants to gather enough history to put it on a plaque
mounted near the bell. It could be a memorial to Africa's founders,
he said. Maybe someday. Logan went to the bell in Africa on New
Year's Eve and gave it a couple of slow rings.

A SENSE OF INEVITABILITY AT THURSTON HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE KILLER AT THURSTON HIGH 
Produced by: Michael Kirk, Miri Navasky and Karen O'Connor 
On: PBS 
Date: Tuesday at 10 p.m. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stated premise of the engrossing ``Frontline'' report, ``The
Killer at Thurston High,'' is that Kip Kinkel, the Oregon boy who
in 1998 killed his parents and then gunned down scores of
schoolmates, wasn't a conspicuously troubled kid. The narration
introduces the chronicle as an account of a life of promise
nurtured in a comforting community by loving parents.
``Understanding what happened inside that family,'' we are told,
``takes us on a journey to an apparently unremarkable past.''
</P>
<P>
   But this really isn't so.
</P>
<P>
   What we see and hear in this thoroughly reported and skillfully
produced 90-minute portrait of Kip Kinkel reveals something quite
different. The substance of this deeply probing reconstruction of
his early years is at odds with, and far smarter than, the often
simple-minded narration. Look closely enough, the documentary seems
to say implicitly, and you will perceive signs of a very troubled
youngster long before his explosive despair led to patricide,
matricide, the bloody shooting murders of two Thurston High
schoolmates, and the maiming of several others.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the picture that emerges is of a family startlingly out
of balance: on one side, the parents, both widely respected high
school Spanish teachers, and their popular and accomplished
daughter Kristin; on the other, the dyslexic, lonely, gun-obsessed
son who hoarded books on bomb-making and occasionally got into
trouble with the law. What gives this film dramatic power is, in
fact, the darkening sense of inevitability that develops as it
reveals telling facets of Kip's boyhood and adolescence, especially
his painfully difficult relationship with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kinkel, says a colleague, was a legendary teacher, even a
showman. Also seen as stern and ``a bit of an autocrat,'' he was an
accomplished athlete who put a high premium on physical prowess. In
a clip from a Kinkel home movie, he praises his daughter's
gymnastic feats, then suggests the younger Kip do a cartwheel
himself. On the videotape he announces that Kip, who falters, needs
to work harder. It seems that Bill, and sometimes his wife Faith,
pushed and needled Kip to accomplish things he didn't have the
tools to master. Through connections with the coach, Bill made his
reluctant 120-pound son play on the high school football team.
</P>
<P>
   Kip's mother had to prevail on her husband to allow Kip to get
psychotherapy. And the therapist _ notwithstanding an unfortunate
interest in guns that he shared with Kip _ diagnosed ``a major
depressive disorder'' and presribed Prozac. He also suggested that
Bill Kinkel ``lighten up'' on his son.
</P>
<P>
   The point isn't, finally, that Bill Kinkel is responsible for
Kip's homicidal behavior, but ``The Killer at Thurston High''
clearly implies that the father's detachment, displeasure, and
shame helped fuel Kip's self-loathing and churning fury. ``I am
always alone . . . I hate myself for what I have become,'' the boy
wrote in a journal to which the ``Frontline'' producers were given
access. This, along with an eerie police videotape showing the
murdered parents and the police department's audiotaped interview
with Kinkel after the school massacre, as well as numerous
interviews with colleagues and family friends, lend the film
urgency, specificity, and the texture of reality.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently no one saw Kip's writings, which expressed pleas for
help and an overwhelming desire to kill people. And he ammassed the
means _ an enormous cache of rifles, pistols, and knives _ but,
remarkably, no one saw the weapons either.
</P>
<P>
   In its way, this resourceful, real-life ``Frontline'' tells a
tale as strange and dark as ``American Beauty,'' with its
superficially placid family seething with explosive problems. But
as strong as it is, and as valuable for its insights into the mind
and background of a young mass murderer, the film would have been
better without its hokey-sounding and openly editorial narration.
</P>
<P>
   It states, for example, that ``those who loved (Kip) believed
they were making the right choices'' and ``still, they could not
keep him from slipping away.''
</P>
<P>
   Such glib presumption doesn't belong in a documentary as
otherwise complex and unsettling as this.

INTERNATIONAL CLIBURN PIANO COMPETITION ROLLS OUT NEW RULES FOR
2001
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The upcoming version of Fort Worth's Cliburn Competition in 2001
will present the most drastic changes that the world's most
prestigious piano contest has undergone since its founding in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change is in the judging procedure, which will lead
to the possibility of more than one gold medal being awarded. Under
the new procedure, ranking will be determined by the awarding of
points from 1 to 25, rather than the old yes-no voting system. If
the two top competitors in the final round are within a close
range, yet to be determined, both will be awarded the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Musicians at the top level are not better than one another,
they are different from one another,'' Cliburn Foundation executive
director Richard Rodzinski said recently. ``The small differences
in points assigned to them may be statistically insignificant.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodzinski discussed the possible changes with members of the
Cliburn's international advisory committee, including pianists,
prominent teachers, presenters, past jurors, past winners, music
critics and directors of other competitions. The one change that
drew the most reservation and questioning was the possibility of
awarding more than one gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference from past competitions will be the complete
change of location from Ed Landreth Auditorium on the Texas
Christian University campus and the Fort Worth Convention Center to
Bass Performance Hall, where all events of the competition will now
be held. Because of the smaller size of the new hall, each of the
six finalists will perform his or her final program of two
concertos twice, in order to accommodate the large audience
expected for the finals.
</P>
<P>
   The three top winners will each receive a cash prize of $20,000,
further reflecting the philosophy of equality at the top. Because
of the huge demand for Cliburn medalists and finalists on
performance series around the world, and because of the need for a
less hectic schedule for the medalists, the Cliburn Foundation will
not present the gold medalist in recital at Carnegie Hall as part
of the prize.
</P>
<P>
   In another significant change, rather than commissioning a
single work from one composer, a committee of 25 American music
professionals will nominate American composers who will be asked to
submit piano solo works; up to five of these works will be sent to
the competitors. The work selected most often for performance in
the semifinal round will receive a grand prize for composition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to encourage the creation of music that meets the
approval of performers,'' Rodzinski said.
</P>
<P>
   Conductor James Conlon will return to conduct the Fort Worth
Symphony Orchestra and Fort Worth Chamber Orchestra in the final
round; the Takacs String Quartet, which has not appeared at the
competition before, will accompany competitors in the chamber music
section of the semifinal round.
</P>
<P>
   As in the 1997 competition, a live screening jury will hear
applicants perform in sites around the world before advancing
approximately 30 pianists to compete in Fort Worth in May and June.
</P>
<P>
   The main competition will be broadcast live on the Internet,
possibly in video format, though the technical possibilities have
not yet been fully settled.
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, the competition will be limited to serious
pianists between the ages of 18 and 30.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for the 2001 Van Cliburn International Piano Competition
will go on sale in late summer of 2000.

&HT;     NFL DRAFT IS NEXT STOP FOR STRUGGLING 49ERS  
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Deep into the divisional round of the playoffs
and with the added intrigue of five head-coaching vacancies around
the league, what better time to speculate on something that won't
happen for another three months, the NFL draft?
</P>
<P>
   We thought you'd agree.
</P>
<P>
   The draft is the subject of much interest hereabouts because the
49ers own the third pick overall. Whether they will use it is
another matter altogether because of general manager Bill Walsh's
penchant for trading down to acquire more picks.
</P>
<P>
   Old Trader Bill could go either way on April 15. The 49ers need
an impact player on defense in the worst way, but they also need
help at several positions. Namely, cornerback, defensive end,
offensive tackle and quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Cerrato, fired by Walsh when he took over as GM a year
ago, is now in position to help the 49ers. Now player personnel
director of the Washington Redskins, Cerrato has three first-round
picks to use or offer in trade.
</P>
<P>
   He's proposed a deal to his old team that would give Washington
the 49ers' No. 3 pick in exchange for the Redskins' 12th and 24th
picks later in the first round. It might be an attractive offer to
Walsh because the 49ers, always jammed up tight against the salary
cap, wouldn't have to give the 12th or 24th pick as big a signing
bonus as they would No.3.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal goes through, it would give the Redskins the second
and third selections in the round after Cleveland picks No.1. If
the Browns go for Florida State wide receiver/kick returner Peter
Warrick to jazz up their offense, the 'Skins would then be in
position to take both of Penn State's defensive gems, end Courtney
Brown and linebacker LaVar Arrington.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they won the NFC East, the Redskins are deficient on
defense, as are the 49ers. San Francisco finished 28th in total
defense. Washington was 30th, ahead of only Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year in a row, the Heisman Trophy winner might
not be the first running back chosen. Wisconsin's Ron Dayne is a
limited talent who would do well playing for a slug-it-out offense
like Kansas City's or Pittsburgh's. Alabama's Shaun Alexander
projects as a better all-around running back than Dayne.
</P>
<P>
   ``You draft a guy like that and you need to have a pounding-type
offense,'' Browns VP Dwight Clark said of the Great Dayne. ``He'll
be a first-round pick. I'm not exactly sure how high yet. He's a
big, powerful guy with great feet.
</P>
<P>
   He certainly can be very successful in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 49ers to be successful in this new century of ours, they
must do the draft right, whether they stand pat at No.3 or trade it
for more picks. This is a team that needs quality and quantity.

 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans are now living about three decades longer than they
did at the start of the last century. For far too many older
Americans, the so-called Golden Years are tarnished by diseases
that seriously undermine the quality of those extra decades _
diseases that with tools now at hand are usually preventable,
postponable or detectable at a curable stage.
</P>
<P>
   Studies of centenarians, most of whom are healthy and
independent, have revealed that it is possible not only to live
long but well. Only about 30 percent of the differences in
longevity among people can be traced to heredity. The rest can be
attributed to how people live, especially their dietary, exercise
and smoking habits and their use of protective medical services
like vaccines and early detection tests.
</P>
<P>
   Yet recent surveys have shown that many older Americans are not
taking advantage of established methods of protecting their health
and lives, including those paid by Medicare. Unless healthy
behaviors become the norm for more Americans, too many baby boomers
will suffer needless sickness and die prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disease and disability need not be inevitable consequences of
aging,'' said Dr. Jeffrey P. Koplan, director of the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. ``Simple
changes in lifestyle: more physical activity, a balanced diet rich
in fruits and vegetables and whole grains, and using preventive
services like mammograms, colorectal cancer screening and
vaccinations can contribute to more years of health and a better
quality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The centers in Atlanta last month released data from several
surveys showing that older people fall far short of the goals to
promote lasting good health. For example, fewer than two older
people in five eat five or more servings of fruits and vegetables
daily. These foods are strongly linked to protection against heart
disease, stroke, some common cancers and loss of vision.
</P>
<P>
   Even for people with small appetites or limited budgets, the
five servings are within reach. A serving equals a cup of raw leafy
vegetables, a half cup of cooked or raw chopped vegetables,
three-fourths cup of vegetable or fruit juice, one medium apple,
banana or orange or a half cup chopped, cooked or canned fruit.
</P>
<P>
   These foods are loaded with protective nutrients and, along with
whole grains like oats, whole wheat, bulgur and brown rice, they
are the only sources of dietary fiber, which is essential to normal
bowel function.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the elderly getting enough exercise. The centers
reported that a third of those 55 to 74 and nearly half of those
over 74 are physically inactive. According to experts who prepared
an article for a recent issue of Patient Care magazine, ``Regular
exercise is the single most important health behavior to prescribe
for longevity. Exercise can reduce or prevent declines in
cardiovascular function, psychological health, muscle mass,
postural stability and flexibility. Exercise also improves sleep
and decreases the propensity to fall. It is important for all older
people, including those in their 80s and 90s, to keep mobile
according to their ability.''
</P>
<P>
   The experts recommended swimming and described walking as
``probably the best and easiest exercise for aging adults.'' A
recent study showed that walking improved the mental abilities of
people over 60, including those who had previously been sedentary.
</P>
<P>
   Other preventive measures are likewise underemployed. You'd
think that when something is free nearly everyone would get it. But
not when it is a vaccine or test for cancer. Medicare pays for all
these: annual flu vaccine; pneumococcal vaccine; an annual
mammogram; a Pap smear and pelvic exam every three years (or
annually for high-risk women); and screening tests for colon,
rectal and prostate cancers. A 20 percent copayment is required for
the cancer tests.
</P>
<P>
   But most older Americans, it seems, are likely to forget about
these medical services, and most doctors fail to remind them.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with a leading killer of older Americans: bacterial
pneumonia. An estimated 20,000 deaths a year are from bacterial
pneumonia, and 90 percent of them occur at age 65 or older. A
vaccine that protects against 23 strains of pneumonia has been
available for 16 years, but still fewer than half of Americans 65
and older have been immunized with this highly effective and
readily available vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Many are under the impression that they don't need the vaccine
because antibiotics can cure pneumonia. They fail to recognize the
huge increase in in antibiotic-resistant strains; drugs cannot be
relied upon. However, a new study done at Minneapolis Veterans
Affairs Medical Center showed that those vaccinated had 43 percent
fewer hospitalizations for pneumonia and influenza infections and
29 percent fewer deaths from all causes.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly are doing a little better with flu vaccine _ as many
as three-fourths were immunized during a recent year in some
states, but only half in others. Influenza is an especially
dangerous disease in the elderly, who are prone to developing
life-threatening complications. Too many are under the mistaken
impression that the vaccine can give them the flu; it cannot
because the viruses used are dead.
</P>
<P>
   As for cancer screening, the likelihood that women will have
regular mammograms declines with age, even though breast cancer
becomes increasingly common as the women grow older.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of 30,000 women ages 55 and older, fewer than half
of women ages 75 to 84 had had even one mammogram, whereas 65
percent of those 55 to 64 said they had had at least one mammogram.
To be maximally effective, mammography should be done annually
starting at age 40.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say that among people 55 and older, fewer than
one in three had done a simple screening test for cancer of the
colon and rectum: a stool smear to detect hidden blood. Fewer still
had flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, both of which are more
accurate and are covered by Medicare. Medicare also covers a barium
enema X-ray, which can detect colorectal cancer as well.
</P>
<P>
   As for Pap smears, women never outgrow their need for them as
long as they have a cervix. Screening should be done at least once
every three years in women 65 and older, although women over 70 who
have never had an abnormal smear may not need further testing.  &QL;

&HT;     S.F. BOAT SHOW BLENDS THE NEW WITH THE OLD _ THE REALLY OLD 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TOM STIENSTRA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN Francisco _ The biggest toy store ever assembled opened its
doors on Friday, but hidden away in the back are the real
treasures.
</P>
<P>
   The toy store, in this case, is the San Francisco Sports and
Boat Show at the Cow Palace, renovated this year with 1,000 new
boats, hundreds of motors and gear in eight halls, along with halls
featuring adventure travel, fishing and golf.
</P>
<P>
   But the real treasure is not the new but the old, an exhibit of
18 classic wooden boats, some of the finest and most beautiful
crafts of the past 100 years. They include boats by Chris-Craft and
Garwood, several trimmed in mahogany, all oiled and polished,
complete with the old inboard engines.
</P>
<P>
   These are the classic luxury ``motorboats'' of the 1940s and
'50s that became world-famous at Lake Tahoe and San Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow it feels just right. Just as Harley-Davidson has had
tremendous success developing retro models, perhaps the boating
industry will take the clue and someone will build a boat that has
all the modern techno goodies, but is made out of wood with classic
looks and lines. A few canoe manufacturers have tried this already
and sell all they make, despite the higher cost.
</P>
<P>
   There haven't been wood boats at the Sports and Boat Show for
more than 25 years, so many visitors will have the chance to see a
classic mahogany Chris-Craft for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   These are blue-ribbon examples, better than showroom new. Even
the engines have been polished.
</P>
<P>
   The show opened Friday for a 10-day run, and the first thing you
see in the lobby is for youngsters, the Tommy Smothers Yo-Yo
School. At first I thought this was ridiculous, after all, Yo-Yos
at a sports show, right? But with champion Yo-Yo guys demonstrating
their amazing tricks and skills, hey, everybody watches.
</P>
<P>
   The floor of the main arena is filled with boats, banners and
engines. Yamaha managed to inveigle the top spot at the head of the
main arena, showing off its full line of new 4-cycle outboards. The
new low-emission 4-cycle outboards are the big talk of the show,
especially as some lakes prohibit 2-cycle motors, and all the major
outboard manufactures showed up this year: Honda, Mercury, Mariner,
Johnson/Evinrude, Suzuki and Yamaha.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the main arena is a 46-foot Hunter
sailboat/yacht, the Queen of the Show, for sale for a
quarter-million simoleons. The way a high-roller was looking at it
on Friday, it might be sold by the end of the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Its mast is so high that it appears to be poking a hole into the
stratosphere. According to show manager Tom Randall, the yacht was
transported into the main arena on Tuesday, with the mast brought
in separately on a big rig, lifted by a 45-ton crane into position,
then locked, bolted and rigged.
</P>
<P>
   Gone this year are the speedboat hall, the benched dogs and
ornate gun displays. New is golf, with an opportunity for visitors
to play nine holes in a miniature golf course. And back is Howard
Arneson of San Rafael, Calif., and his 175-mph jet boat,
occasionally seen ripping across San Francisco Bay and out to the
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   A fishing tackle supermarket is being operated by Fisherman's
Warehouse (can you believe on Friday I bought yet another fishing
rod), and nearby is a 40-foot aquarium stocked with fish from the
Delta. Out through the door is the Fishing Seminar Theater, with
four seminars a day, highlighted by Barry Canevaro on fishing the
Delta for striped bass and sturgeon.
</P>
<P>
   I will be closely watching the prices of what dealers call,
``the family package,'' that is, boat, trailer and motor, ready to
go. Typically by the end of the weekend, one dealer will come up
with a package that sells like hotcakes. I'll be looking, then
reporting back on Wednesday.

&HT;     TV DRAMAS BEND TO GOVERNMENT AND BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TIM GOODMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ If you're watching ``Stark Raving Mad'' on
NBC _ and millions of people apparently are _ there can be only one
reason: You must be high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kick the habit of ludicrously bad television. Just say no!
This message brought to you by the U.S. government.''
</P>
<P>
   If only the office of the drug czar were this straightforward
about its involvement in prime-time television _ instead of
script-doctoring over drug issues _ then it's something we could
get behind. Teach us lessons that are actually of use to us! For
example, a character on ``Once and Again'' could remark: ``We're in
our 40s, gorgeous, middle class and we both have flat stomachs. Why
are we whining and acting like our lives are difficult?''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of government interference could actually help people.
</P>
<P>
   The other kind of interference _ in case you've missed the TV
scandal of the moment _ centers on whether networks are dodging
their public service requirements by taking those just-say-no
messages out of commercials and putting them in the story lines of
``ER'' and other popular shows.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the government _ which allegedly gets to see the
scripts and offer advice _ absolves them of their social duty and
the networks can then sell that very expensive commercial time to
some dot-com company for huge profit.
</P>
<P>
   (Remember when parents were worried their children would hear
Satanic messages if they played their pop music backward? Now
parents are worried the government will recruit their kids to be
Washington interns if they watch ``The West Wing.'')
</P>
<P>
   This latest scandal is disturbing but not so surprising if you
know how TV works. Of course, the average person doesn't _ you have
better things to do with your time. So it may be easy to work up a
First Amendment snit or at least some kind of Big Brother
objection.
</P>
<P>
   But before you get all vexed about the sanctity of the airwaves,
remember this: Television does not have a soul. It never has.
Television is a for-profit business, and like military vendors and
toilet seat makers before them, it has often struck gold by shaking
hands with Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   Let's play a quick, painless numbers game: The government took
$1 billion of your tax dollars and told the broadcast networks,
``We want to buy advertising time.'' The networks said, ``Get in
line.'' The government said, ``Because we could regulate you into
the ground _ and because the airwaves are public _ we think you
should give us back something in return.''
</P>
<P>
   A deal was struck. The networks would provide $2 billion in
advertising time for that $1 billion in tax money. It was a
two-for-one that pleased both sides (but probably not you, if you
had been asked in advance).
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the line, the government's drug czar decided
that teens tune out public service announcements and it might make
a bigger impression if George Clooney, say, or somebody on
``Dawson's Creek,'' waves off a bong-load of top-shelf pot.
</P>
<P>
   The networks said, ``Oh, we do that kind of story all the
time.'' (Which is true.) So good many of them didn't have to air
public service announcements and hence, essentially, got your tax
money for free.
</P>
<P>
   It was stealing money, not brainwashing. A backroom deal, yes.
</P>
<P>
   But a plot that will lead to government propaganda spewed via
``Ally McBeal?'' _ no.
</P>
<P>
   The networks may seem dumb, but they know you're smarter than
all these watchdog groups give you credit for. If, for example,
some of the questions on ``Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'' focused
on campaign finance reform _ clearly you'd know the fix was in.
</P>
<P>
   Big Brother doctoring scripts and controlling your mind would be
a great story, but the reality is far duller. It's simply Hollywood
selling out _ which it does every day.
</P>
<P>
   Special interest groups of all kinds read scripts in advance on
a regular basis. They ``advise.'' It's business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Two much more alarming revelations came out Friday. The
government giving the thumbs-up to story lines that show kids why
it's bad to be a crack-head is less dangerous than the following:
</P>
<P>
   First, Peter Roth, president of Warner Bros. Television admitted
the studio was compensated in some manner for product placement and
gratuitous mentions of Pottery Barn in a recent episode of
``Friends.'' Subliminal is wasn't: The characters mentioned the
store name frequently and they obsessed about a particular table _
which just happens to appear in the latest Pottery Barn catalog you
got in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Donald Vereen, the deputy director at thnment's
drug czar office (officially called the White House Office of
National Drug Control Policy, if you're wondering why it's always
shortened) came here to the TV critics mid-season press tour to
tout a study that said _ surprise _ illicit drug depiction on
network television is almost non-existent.
</P>
<P>
   Vereen, and the people who did the study, were proud. The study
looked at 168 episodes of 42 top-rated dramas and sitcoms. These
included the 20 most popular shows among white, African American
and Hispanic teens.
</P>
<P>
   That's the core target in the campaign against drugs. And the
study found that illicit drugs were in only 3 percent of all
episodes (great!), tobacco in 19 percent (pretty good!) and alcohol
in 71 percent (whoops!).
</P>
<P>
   But nobody seemed at all worried about the alcohol part. Even
though Vereen said illicit drugs kill about 20,000 people in the
country, alcohol _ ``many, many times more.'' Next question.
</P>
<P>
   As you know, those who produce illicit drugs can't advertise on
TV. Neither can tobacco companies. But alcohol _ it's a television
staple. Don't look for the networks to partner with the government
any time soon, overtly or covertly, on an anti-drinking campaign.
Uncle Sam doesn't buy enough ad time to compete with beer
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Just another lesson in how TV really works.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Creepy things from beneath the sea are cliches of modern
exploration, but the abyss has now produced a surprise so bizarre
as to have touched off hot international debate: tiny, mysterious,
apparently living creatures far smaller than any known bacterium _
so small as to strain the limits on what is needed for independent
life.
</P>
<P>
   While their finders hail these oddities as a strange new form of
microbe teeming with tendrils, their colonies seeming to grow like
wild, skeptics see them as probably the newest delusion in a global
hunt for the smallest living things.
</P>
<P>
   Their discoverers call them nanobes (pronounced NAN-obes),
because their size is in the realm of nanometers (or billionths of
a meter). At 20 to 150 nanometers in length, they are smaller than
cells, smaller than fungi, smaller than the smallest known
bacterium and roughly the same size as viruses, which are
considered nonliving parasites because they need hosts to
reproduce. Thus, nanobes call into question the minimum size
requirements for terrestrial life.
</P>
<P>
   If alive, the find bears on the pervasiveness of terrestrial
life, new forms of which are being discovered so deep in such
abundance that some scientists suspect the planet has a hidden
biosphere of microbes extending down miles whose total mass may
exceed that of all surface life. The find might also influence
hunts for microscopic aliens perhaps hidden in the solar system's
deep netherworlds, the discovery of which would prove that life in
the universe is not unique to Earth but an inherent property of
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists in Australia at the University of Queensland
discovered the tiny oddities four years ago in ancient sandstones
retrieved from an oil drilling site some three miles below the
Western Australian seabed. Described publicly for the first time in
late 1998, the fuzzy tangles of filaments resembled fungi and
appeared to reproduce quickly, forming dense colonies of tendrils.
Laboratory analysis of them repeatedly found signs of DNA, or
deoxyribonucleic acid, the master molecule of heredity and life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our recent work provides further evidence'' that the tangles
are in fact alive, said Dr. Philippa J.R. Uwins, a scientist at the
University of Queensland's center for Microscopy and Microanalysis,
who leads the research. ``They're extraordinary and incredibly
pretty, the way they grow between the minerals. I'm fascinated by
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Uwins' team has written two new papers, one being reviewed
for publication and the other just submitted, that describe the
most recent evidence and experiments. So far, the main findings are
that the colonies grow spontaneously, contain DNA, are rich in
biological elements like carbon, oxygen and nitrogen, and when cut
in two show distinct outer and inner layers, including a possible
nuclear area that holds DNA.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid for skeptical rigor, the team has sought nonbiological
explanations but has concluded that none can account for the
observations. Its future research goals include quantifying the
growth rate of the colonies and sequencing their DNA, which could
help connect them to the known tree of terrestrial life.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem that firm knowledge about the minimal size
requirements for life would be old stuff. After all, it was several
centuries ago that Antony van Leeuwenhoek first opened human eyes
to the invisible world of microscopic life, describing a riot of
``wee animalcules.'' But it turns out that the lower limits of life
are still a biological mystery and their elucidation has only
recently become a popular scientific objective.
</P>
<P>
   The topic exploded in debate four years ago when scientists
reported finding tiny fossil microbes in a 4.5-billion-year-old,
potato-size Martian meteorite that crashed to Earth in Antarctica
long ago. At 20 to 200 nanometers, the putative Martian fossils
were smaller than any known terrestrial life, and that discrepancy
quickly sowed doubts about the veracity of the alien-life
discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, many papers have tried to prove the existence of
tiny terrestrial analogs and, by extension, the plausibility of the
Martian fossils. The Australian team's paper is one of the genre's
most recent entries.
</P>
<P>
   To help sort through the rush of claims, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration asked the National Research
Council of the National Academy of Sciences to convene an expert
panel. It met in late 1998 and recently published a 148-page
report, ``Size Limits of Very Small Micro-organisms.''
</P>
<P>
   The 18 experts said that known terrestrial bacteria in the range
of 200 nanometers probably marked the lower size limit for current
life, but held out the possibility that primitive unknown microbes
might have been as small as 50 nanometers, about the size of the
Australian nanobes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tremendous number of papers are coming out,'' said Dr. John
A. Baross, a biologist at the University of Washington, in Seattle,
who was on the panel's steering group.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's no way a free-living cell is going to be less than
100 nanometers,'' he said, noting that such lilliputian sizes would
seemingly leave too little room for the enzymatic and genetic
machinery essential for life. For instance, a single ribosome, a
kind of tiny factory that cells use in great numbers to make
proteins, could fill a membrane sphere 50 to 60 nanometers wide.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Norman R. Pace, a microbiologist at the University of
Colorado and another member of the research council's steering
group, agreed that nanobes were highly unlikely to be alive. Their
lower size limit of 20 nanometers, he noted, was about the width of
10 DNA molecules, making them too small to support all the other
needed cellular machinery. ``I don't think much of it,'' he said of
the nanobe claim.
</P>
<P>
   The rough 100-nanometer size limit for living things, Baross of
the University of Washington noted, ``doesn't rule out biological
entities that are 20 or 30 or 50 nanometers wide. They're just not
going to be free-living and self-replicating. We don't know if
these things might exist and have some function. They might be
signaling or doing all sorts of novel things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Australian nanobes, he added, might well represent such
components of life, perhaps working together in a primordial kind
of communalism only now coming to light and soon to rewrite the
textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't be anything like the traditional micro-organism we
know about,'' he said of the nanobes. ``We have to think about them
in a different way, and one is that they are components'' that
function as a living organism only in totality, the whole being
greater than the sum of the parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very interested in whether these small things are
biological in nature,'' Baross said, ``and, if so, what their
function is.''
</P>
<P>
   In the research council's report, Dr. Jeffrey G. Lawrence, a
biologist at the University of Pittsburgh, laid out a detailed
analysis of such hypothetical communal life made up of
extraordinarily tiny components, calling the aggregate a meta-cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such organisms need not maintain a full complement of genes,''
Lawrence wrote, referring to the basic unit of heredity. His own
computer simulations, he added, predicted the existence of stable
meta-cell components that held as few as a single gene.
</P>
<P>
   ``One may consider the meta-cell to be a single-celled organism
whose genome is distributed through a network,'' Lawrence wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to a hypothetical meta-cell component bearing a
single gene, the smallest known living bacterium has 470 genes,
making the theoretical entity seem quite puny.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jack W. Szostak, a geneticist at Harvard, said in the
research council's report that certain terrestrial environments
like compressed sediments might be conducive to the evolution of
very small whole organisms of about 50 nanometers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given present uncertainties,'' he wrote, ``it seems wise to be
prepared to detect life-forms of a wide range of sizes.''
</P>
<P>
   In Australia, Dr. Uwins stumbled on her nanobes while examining
just the kind of compressed sediments that Szostak proposed as a
possible realm of diminutive life. The sandstone samples came from
deep petroleum exploration wells off western Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Dr. Uwins and her Australian colleagues Dr. Richard I.
Webb, Dr. Anthony P. Taylor and Dr. Thomas Loy are working hard to
cut through the theorizing by proving the existence of extremely
small life. The team's main tool is a Jeol 890 scanning electron
microscope, an instrument that is able to magnify objects nearly 1
million times. By contrast, most electron microscopes have
magnifications less than half as strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an extreme speciality machine, very expensive and very
powerful,'' said Steve Hamilton of Jeol U.S.A., in Peabody, Mass.
``There are only two or three in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Stunning electron micrographs of the nanobes, printed in the
November-December 1998 issue of American Mineralogist, a journal of
the Mineralogical Society of America, show riots of filaments and
tendrils, their ends often swollen and suggestive of reproductive
budding. Constrictions along some of the filaments ``most likely
represent septa,'' or cavities within the nanobes, the team wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Dissective cuts through the axes of some of the filaments
``demonstrate that nanobes have an amorphous membrane structure,''
the team wrote. Such an outer covering, the scientists added, ``is
consistent with biological material and excludes the presence of
crystalline mineral compounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The colonies of nanobes grew so rapidly and so large, the team
reported in American Mineralogist, that within weeks of becoming
established on growth substrates they became visible to the naked
eye, appearing as dense colonies of opaque, white, brown or gray
filaments.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to nail down the life issue, the team treated the
nanobes with three kinds of DNA stains, in each case getting
positive results.
</P>
<P>
   In its new research, the team is doing molecular and structural
analyses to see if the organisms are related to bacteria or fungi,
or belong to a different evolutionary tree altogether. New
photomicrographs have revealed details of nanobe interiors, have
pinpointed areas rich in DNA and have found ``a whole range of
interesting morphologies that look like life-cycle stages in
fungi,'' Dr. Uwins said in an interview. ``They're striking.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers say they are increasingly confident that their
investigations are going to bolster the Martian meteorite find.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a top goal of the Mars exploration program is to see if
life started on Mars early in its history, with experts eager to
look for Martian microbes and microbial fossils.
</P>
<P>
   Baross of the University of Washington said the kind of ferment
now churning in biology would aid the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's developing the tools and attracting really smart people
into this field,'' he said. ``Most of us in microbiology are
prepared for any kind of surprise,'' including organisms smaller
than expected theoretically, and tiny alien life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dogma in microbiology is out the window in the past few
years,'' Baross added. ``The field has rediscovered itself. It's
essentially a new science.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Skating single-file only inches apart from one another, all
perfectly in sync, a group of 10 skaters zips past me. ``Track!''
someone yells as the group approaches the turn. That's speed
skating etiquette warning all slower skaters to move out of their
way.
</P>
<P>
   I am one of about 25 skaters warming up for the Flushing Meadows
Speedskating Club's practice at the World's Fair ice rink in
Flushing Meadow Park, Queens. The club, as well as speed skating,
are two of New York's best kept secrets.
</P>
<P>
   It's my fourth session on speed skates. I'm not as fast or as
graceful as the others, but I'm focusing on my form and technique.
Several friendly, experienced skaters, along with the club's coach,
have told me just to work on basics: skating low with knees bent,
leaning over at the waist; centering body weight over the middle to
rear of the blades; shifting hips from side-to-side; skating on the
edges of the blades; and pushing each skate sideways rather than
backward.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time since I started skating that my edges are
finally gripping the ice _ a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Two of my cycling teammates had discovered speed skating and
kept telling me what a blast it was.
</P>
<P>
   All I knew about speed skating were the names Eric and Beth
Heiden, Dan Jansen and Bonnie Blair. From watching the Olympics, I
knew they skated fast and won lots of Olympic gold medals.
</P>
<P>
   Although I had never tried this oldest form of ice skating, I
grew up in northern Michigan doing figure and hockey skating in our
backyard, on frozen lakes and secluded ponds surrounded by sand
dunes. Although some 14 years have passed since I last wore skates,
I thought speed skating would be exciting, and a new and different
way to maintain fitness during the winter.
</P>
<P>
   With speeds up to 35 miles per hour, speed skating is the
fastest self-propelled sport. In speed skating, there are two
disciplines: long (metric) track and short track. Long track is a
battle against the clock as two competitors skate in individual
lanes on a 400-meter oval. Long-track skating dates to the 1800s in
the United States, and was one of the most popular sports at the
first Winter Olympics, in 1924.
</P>
<P>
   Because there are only a handful of long-track ovals in the
United States, most speed skaters skate short track. Short-track
racing is done on a 111-meter track set up on a standard hockey
rink. Short track is a pack event in which four to six skaters
start on a line and the first to cross the finish line wins.
Because a hockey rink is all that's required, short-track skating
is becoming popular in Southern states like Florida, Georgia and
California.
</P>
<P>
   I was trying short-track racing.
</P>
<P>
   After lacing my boots, I stepped gingerly onto the ice and
wobbled along with my blades slipping and sliding beneath my feet.
I wore tights, a thermal top, vest, cap, helmet and gloves. Many of
the more experienced skaters wore Lycra skin suits or bike-racing
garb with knee pads, shin guards and neck guards.
</P>
<P>
   My first night, about 20 skaters, ranging in age from 10 to
mid-70s, were on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   At my second and third sessions, I worked more on technique. I
found the crossover turns most challenging. Because you always
skate in a counter-clockwise fashion, the turns require crossing
the right leg over the left in a series of strokes. While
maintaining your speed and focus, the crossover requires leaning
into the turn, hips first with left shoulder dropped, while looking
beyond the turn. Mastering the crossover is the crucial element of
short-track skating.
</P>
<P>
   At my fourth session, a former Korean national team skater gave
me some pointers. His skating was mesmerizing: long, graceful
strokes that appeared effortless. Holding me steady, he bent my
legs until I was in a super-crouched position, then lifted one leg
at a time and moved it slowly through the speed skating stroke.
</P>
<P>
   In this position, the quad of the balancing leg has to support
the entire body weight for several seconds. ``That,'' he said, ``is
speed skating.'' He also had me follow him around the track several
times, keeping my right hand tucked behind my back, only swinging
my left arm back and forth. This helped me keep my shoulders steady
and parallel to the ice rather than moving them side-to-side. These
simple tips improved my skating tremendously.

 &HT;    Bloodless surgical techniques catching on
 &HT;    (EDS: With box at bottom of file.)
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Spiritually, Sharon Googer was a vibrant woman, a
Jehovah's Witness who prayed every day. But physically, Googer, 43,
was dying.
</P>
<P>
   A virus had attacked her heart's lining, causing symptoms
including nausea and shortness of breath. ``It was almost as if (my
heart) was encrusted in cement,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But her doctors could offer no assurance that she would survive
the needed operation without a blood transfusion. And Googer
refused to veer from her religious belief barring the use of stored
blood. That left her with two options: prayer and research.
</P>
<P>
   Both worked, she said. Googer discovered a new bloodless
surgical program that began earlier this month at Atlanta Medical
Center. The program uses a combination of drugs, surgical
techniques and special equipment to reduce the amount of blood lost
during surgery and hence the need for blood transfusions.
</P>
<P>
   Within six days, Googer was recuperating at home, healthy in
body and soul.
</P>
<P>
   But bloodless surgery offers potential benefits beyond those
relating to religious requirements. As scientists track more
blood-borne illnesses and hospitals struggle with dwindling blood
supplies, the technique is gaining favor with both patients and
health care providers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 there were only a handful of bloodless surgery centers
in the nation; now there are almost 100. And those who run the
programs say that between one-fourth and one-half of the patients
using them are not there for religious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is catching attention on a global scale,'' said Irene
Kopen, co-founder of the National Association for Bloodless
Medicine and Surgery at St. Vincent's Hospital in Cleveland. ``The
general public now knows the risk of transfusion. And they want to
avoid it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some hospitals have been using some bloodless techniques and
equipment for years. ``Most contemporary surgeons make every effort
to preserve blood rather than lose it,'' explained Dr. Stephen M.
Barnett, chief of surgery at Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta. ``And
that does not require a special program.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've put together an infrastructure that allows patients to
do one-stop shopping,'' said Dr. Michael Smith, a cardiothoracic
surgeon who performs bloodless surgeries at several Atlanta
hospitals. ``Not only does the program offer all the drugs and
equipment needed, but they have the teams that are committed to
this.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a key element to the success of a bloodless surgical
program, because there is always the risk that a patient could die
without a blood transfusion, Smith said. In some hospitals,
operating rooms have turned into battlegrounds as doctors argue
among themselves about whether to override patients' requests for
no blood transfusions in order to save their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might have a surgeon who's willing to see it through
(without a transfusion), but the anesthesiologist who isn't. Or
vice versa,'' explained Smith. ``In this program, everyone is
committed to the patient's wishes.'' Most operations already have
evolved into less bloody affairs than they once were, a result of
new technologies. Laparoscopic procedures have eliminated the need
for large incisions that might require a transfusion. Also, new
surgeon's tools have greatly reduced bleeding. Harmonic scalpels,
which use vibrations to cut and clot blood; electrocautery, which
burns and seals vessels as it cuts; and gamma knives, which use
radiation to repair problems such as brain tumors without
incisions, are all increasingly common.
</P>
<P>
   But some procedures still routinely require transfusions. Trauma
cases, such as car accidents, gunshot wounds and broken bones,
often need transfusions. And traditionally, open heart surgery has
required about one or two pints of blood, and hip surgery has
needed about four pints.
</P>
<P>
   If a patient must have this kind of care, bloodless surgery
becomes more complex.
</P>
<P>
   Often doctors will use a ``cell saver,'' a device that recycles
a patient's own blood that is lost during surgery, collecting and
cleaning it before returning it to the patient through an
intravenous tube. A host of drugs might also be prescribed in the
weeks before surgery, most notably synthetic erythropoietin, which
stimulates the body to produce more blood. This can protect a
patient from needing a transfusion to replace blood lost during the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, doctors will take steps while operating to reduce
bleeding. Often that includes such measures as lowering the
temperature of the operating room and changing the angle of the
patient's position. In bloodless heart surgery, for example, Smith
said he tilts the operating table by as much as 45 degrees,
lowering the patient's head. This, he has learned, helps the body
maintain proper blood pressure without the need for a heart-lung
machine, which increases the likelihood of transfusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more meticulous,'' he said. ``But minimally invasive
heart surgery works _ and the patients fare very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are also examining whether fewer transfusions result
in better outcomes:
</P>
<P>
   _ A 1999 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine
found that critically ill patients who received fewer units of
blood had a better chance of survival than younger, less ill
patients who did receive transfusions. The study was conducted on a
group of 838 patients in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   _ A University of Rochester Medical Center study found that
transfusions weaken recipients' immune systems, leaving them two to
five times more likely to suffer postoperative infections.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Journal of the American Medical Association reported in
1998 that a decade-long study concluded that transfusions neither
increased nor decreased morbidity in patients who underwent surgery
for hip fractures. Thus, the researchers said, doctors should
``reconsider'' whether transfusion is advisable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's what caught the attention of the doctors,''
said Kopen, of the bloodless medicine association. ``They started
noticing that their patients were doing better when they underwent
bloodless surgery. Their hospital stays were shorter and their
recovery was faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor was the AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jehovah's Witnesses had been demanding transfusion-free
surgery for more than half a century, it wasn't until AIDS erupted
in the 1980s, and the AIDS virus was transmitted through blood
transfusions, that the demand was sytematically addressed. ``We
were a bunch of idiot radicals before the epidemic,'' said Vince
Velluci, chairman of the Jehovah's Witnesses hospital liaison
committee in Atlanta. ``But AIDS hit, and suddenly everyone stood
up and took notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1981 and 1998, almost 5,300 men and more than 4,000
women contracted the AIDS virus through transfusions, according to
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, health workers were discovering an alphabet
soup of strains of hepatitis, a viral infection linked to blood
products. At one point, they worried only about Hepatitis A, B and
C, but new strains are constantly cropping up, according to the
CDC.
</P>
<P>
   The risk remains low. Because of better testing and screening of
donors, the risk of getting AIDS is about 1 in a million and the
risk of getting hepatitis C is about 1 in 100,000. And a new
technique called nucleic acid testing, or NAT, currently in FDA
review, should lower the risk even further, said Karen Eisele,
spokeswoman of blood services for the Southern region of the
American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   But as testing becomes more sophisticated, fewer donors are
acceptable. And that's led to chronic shortages in blood supplies
here and across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   And blood is not cheap. Hospitals pay about $500 for each blood
unit _ which is little more than a pint _ making bloodless surgery
a far more economical option.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Many hospitals are seeking ways to conserve blood.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, 4 million patients receive transfusions each year,
according to the American Association of Blood Banks. But the
amount of transfusions has dropped by more than 6 percent from 1989
to 1992, according to the Center for Blood Research in Boston. And,
the center said, the trend is continuing, although newer figures
were not available.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, patients have started banking their own blood for
operations _ called autologous transfusions. But that is still not
an option for Jehovah's Witnesses, who believe they cannot accept
blood _ even their own _ if circulation is stopped.
</P>
<P>
   And that has forced physicians and manufacturers to become more
creative, said Melvin Satterfield, co-ordinator for the Atlanta
Medical Center's bloodless surgery program.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to come up with alternatives,'' said Satterfield, who
is also one of the 40,000 members of Jehovah's Witnesses in
Atlanta. ``And so far, it's resulted in better medicine for us.''
</P>
<P>
   BLOOD BOX:
</P>
<P>
   If you are interested in bloodless surgery, there are several
questions that you should ask yourself and your physician, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   _ Determine how committed you are to bloodless surgery. Perhaps
you are only interested in banking your own blood. Or you might
want to use the drugs to pump up the volume of blood before surgery
or request a ``cell saver,'' which conserves and recirculates the
blood lost in surgery.
</P>
<P>
   _ Discuss with your physician how comfortable he or she is with
bloodless surgery. Find out what experience or education they have
had with such surgery. Also make sure they have discussed your
wishes with the other members of the surgical team.
</P>
<P>
   _ Learn more about it on your own. Several Web sites explain the
basics, including the Bloodless Surgery and Medicine Institute at
www.bsmi.net or the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New
Jersey's bloodless surgical program at www.umdnj.edu/univhosp/. And

operations, check out the ``Medical Care and Blood'' section of

   MOZDOK, Russia _ The Russian military on Monday renewed its
assault on Grozny as the Kremlin sought to bring its siege of the
Chechen capital to a speedy and decisive end.
</P>
<P>
   Under clearing skies, Russian aircraft and artillery bombarded
the city in a furious effort to soften up the rebel resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Russian aircraft carried out a record number of attacks on
Grozny. On Monday, the city was aflame, with plumes of smoke rising
into the sky. Russian television showed the ruins of a red brick
house where a sniper had been positioned, vivid testimony to the
firepower now raining down on the city.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second major Russian offensive against the Islamic
rebels in the city, who have stubbornly refused to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   The first began in December, as Russian forces sought to seize
the city by early January. That Russian attack faltered after young
and sometimes inexperienced Russian troops were bloodied in
firefights with battle-hardened rebels, who hid in cellars and
among the ruins of the city. Bad weather also hampered air and
artillery strikes.
</P>
<P>
   As the fighting inside the city reached a stalemate, Russian
authorities announced a pause in their barrage against Grozny,
asserting that they wanted to respect Russian Orthodox Christmas
and the end of Ramadan, the Muslim religious holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Now Russian troops have regrouped and decided to try again.
Touting the new offensive, Lt. Gen. Gennadi Troshev, the deputy
commander of Russian troops in the Northern Caucasus region, said
there would be ``radical changes'' in the strategy for taking the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Troshev did not say what the changes would be. But they seem to
involve a sharp escalation in air strikes and artillery barrages
even though the city is still occupied by thousands of civilians.
After weeks of boasting that it would conduct a commando style
operation to grab back the city, Russia now seems to have turned to
brute force to capture the Chechen capital.
</P>
<P>
   Official Russian government estimates of the number of civilians
trapped in Grozny range as high as 40,000. Many of the civilians
are simply too old, too injured or too frightened to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Chechnya's civilians has been a major concern for
Western governments and organizations, including the Council of
Europe, which has hinted it might expel Russia if it did not temper
its assault on areas where civilians reside.
</P>
<P>
   David Russell-Johnston, the president of the council's
parliamentary delegation, met in Moscow on Monday with Russia's
acting president, Vladimir Putin, and other senior Russian
officials to urge a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expressed the views that have already been set out by the
assembly in resolutions concerning a cease-fire, concerning
negotiations, concerning the free movement of refugees and access
to humanitarian organizations,'' Russell-Johnston told reporters
after a meeting with Yegor Stroyev, the speaker of Russia's upper
house of parliament. ``We are looking for some way of ending the
conflict ... soon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Russell-Johnston received a polite reception from Putin, but
there was no indication that the Russians were interested in his
proposals. The Kremlin arranged for him to conduct a fact-finding
mission in the North Caucasus just as it did in December for Knut
Vollebaek, the chairman of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, whose appeals for a cease-fire were also
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the international community to show an understanding
of our position, by relying on facts about the real situation from
truthful information and not from propaganda,'' Putin said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Grozny was the scene of some of the Russian military's bitterest
setbacks in the first war in Chechnya, which lasted from 1994 to
1996 and resulted in the de facto independence of the breakaway
republic. Humiliated by their defeat, Russia's military commanders
have set a high priority on taking it back.
</P>
<P>
   Russian generals have refused to set a deadline for capturing
the city, but Nikolai Koshman, the Russian vice prime minister who
administers the Russian-controlled areas of Chechnya, said in an
interview that he plans to move to Grozny by early February.
</P>
<P>
   A fighter under the command of Bislan Gantamirov, the Chechen
paramilitary leader who is allied with Moscow, said his forces
planned to operate in the city within two weeks. But similar boasts
have been frustrated in the past by determined rebel resistance.
</P>
<P>
   There are no reliable figures on the number of rebel fighters in
Grozny. Estimates by the Russian military have varied from 500 to
several thousand.
</P>
<P>
   Though they are vastly outnumbered, the rebels have proved to be
tough foes, fighting from fortified positions in the city. Russian
casualties have climbed substantially as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military still insists that it does not plan to
``storm'' Grozny, a phrase that recalls the disastrous Russian
assault on the city at the start of the first Chechen war when a
Russian armored column raced to the center of the city and was
wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the military describes its Grozny operation as an
``activization of military actions.''
</P>
<P>
   There does not appear to be anything subtle about the new
Russian tactics, however. When Troshev was asked last week why
Russian forces might be more successful this time, he smiled and
pointed at the clearing skies as Russian warplanes streaked
overhead.

NEW BIKES BEING DEVELOPED FOR USE AT THE SOUTH POLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(HLW) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine trying to do wheelies on a bicycle at the frigid South
Pole. Depending on one's point of view, this would take extreme
biking up _ or down _ to a new level.
</P>
<P>
   Such an idea is no longer fantasy. Two bicycles designed and
built specifically for the harsh conditions of Antarctica are to
undergo formal testing at the South Pole this week, part of a
program to make life a little easier _ and perhaps a bit more fun _
for those who spend long, dark winters at the remote outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Ice Prowler, this custom model bicycle was engineered
and built by advanced design students at the Art Institute of
Pittsburgh. Students at the institute have worked on projects for
six years in collaboration with the Center for Astrophysical
Research in Antarctica, or CARA, a consortium of universities that
builds and operates a variety of telescopes on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the student projects has been on ways to make life
better for those working on Antarctica. After consulting with
researchers and technicians who winter there, through months of
perpetual darkness and cold, students have designed a two-piece
glove that keeps researchers' hands warm while they work with small
objects and a mask that warms inhaled air while venting moisture
that could otherwise fog goggles.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen M. Butler, head of the graphics design program at the
institute, is in Antarctica to test the bicycles, where he will
evaluate their traction, control and ease of use. He is to use
specialized testing criteria developed by students, including a
heart-rate monitor to check a rider's exertion and comfort, to
examine the performance of each bike on snow and ice. Butler said
he also hoped to make a satellite telephone call to the class so
that students could participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the tests, I hope to spend most of my time talking to
people and seeing how they actually work and live at the South
Pole,'' Butler said before leaving on his trip. ``I hope to come
back with ideas for new projects we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   People stationed on Antarctica have tried bicycles before, but
with limited success. Conventional mountain bikes with
2.5-inch-wide tires work during the summer season on well-traveled
paths but bog down in the winter's drifting snows and oppressive
cold. Winter temperatures averaging 76 degrees below zero also
result in plastic parts' cracking and cables' breaking, disabling
brakes and gearshifts.
</P>
<P>
   A practical reason for having bicycles on Antarctica is to help
staff members at the university consortium's observatories, which
are three-quarters of a mile from the main station. The telescopes
are isolated in an area known as the Dark Sector to keep light
pollution and stray electromagnetic radiation from fouling their
observations. Workers walk to and from the observatories several
times a day at about 3 or 4 miles an hour; bicycles could triple
this speed.
</P>
<P>
   The challenging Ice Prowler project has taken two years between
conception and putting two bikes on Antarctic ice. The students
designed and tested new types of frames, wheels, gears, seats and
other components until settling on the best parts for a
low-maintenance bicycle that could be used by people clad in
cumbersome cold-weather gear riding outside in extreme
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   The students settled on a squat-looking design built around
aluminum mountain bike frames donated by Hanebrink Bicycles of Big
Bear Lake, Calif. They chose high, wide handlebars and
stubby-looking metal wheels fitted with vulcanized rubber golf-cart
tires with treads cut in a special V-shaped pattern. The bikes also
have a simple, single-speed gear system, quick-release switches
that let gloved hands easily adjust seat and handlebar height, and
a metal, disc brake operated by a handlebar lever
</P>
<P>
   Bill Farrell, an industrial design instructor who supervised the
project, said the students tested other types of tires, including a
hollow, molded resin model and one made of steel mesh that worked
like a rolling snowshoe. ``These tires were more exotic and
expensive, but not necessary,'' he said, ``The off-the-shelf option
seems good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The group also tested several designs for seats that would not
compress insulation in the rider's clothing, resulting in a cold
bottom. One bike has a plastic-shell seat covering a foam interior
while the other has a sculptured, solid wood seat that Farrell said
worked surprisingly well in preliminary tests.
</P>
<P>
   After the trials, the researchers will leave one or both
bicycles at the pole for the coming winter season and hope to send
a refined production model that has all the bugs worked out next
year. This type of cycle has commercial potential, for ski resorts
or for winter cross-country riding, that could give students the
added experience of bringing a new product to market, Farrell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real value of this is the experience the kids are getting
out of it,'' he said.

 BOOK REVIEW of:
 ``The Desert:  Further Studies in Natural Appearances'' 
 By John C. Van Dyke (Johns Hopkins, $16.95) 
 &HT;     By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John C. Van Dyke's ``The Desert'' has been a classic since it
was first published in 1901. Beaten, frayed copies of the book's
many editions sell for good money in used bookstores to those
connoisseurs who appreciate Van Dyke's peculiar brand of
lunacy-genius.
</P>
<P>
   For Van Dyke _ an art critic and professor at Rutgers University
at the turn of the century _ was a master of over-the-top, purple
prose: descriptive enthusiasm as literature. He is so extreme, he
is brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   In describing the desert, in minute detail and in raptures of
syntax, he has few peers. He manages to take one tiny bit of
observation and make it seem, at any given micromoment, the whole
of creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Desert'' belongs in the library of every reader who loves
the dry areas of the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   This new paperback edition is graced with a critical
introduction by Peter Wild, who makes quite clear that Van Dyke
was, in some ways, a fraud. Rather than the farsighted ecologist he
makes himself out to be, he was an effete Easterner, and probably a
bag man for robber baron Andrew Carnegie _ who is the dedicatee of
the book.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyke pretended he had spent two years wandering the deserts
of Arizona, California and Mexico. In reality, he visited his
brother in California, traveled across Arizona on train and carried
a bribe from Carnegie to a former union agitator who had fled to
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the truth of Van Dyke's biography, he was a profound
observer of what he saw, and a brilliant writer.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to quote small bits of Van Dyke's special brand of
prose. It flows on like a great river, carrying all before it in
cascades of paean. You cannot swim against its current.
</P>
<P>
   When he talks about the adverse effect of human habitation on
the environment, he says, ``Even the grizzly, secure in the
chaparral of his mountain home, flinches as he crosses the white
man's trail. The boot mark in the dust smells of blood and iron.''
</P>
<P>
   In that simple phrase, ``blood and iron,'' he manages to imply
the entire 2,000-year history of war and technology that has been
the European legacy.
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorite sections of the book is Van Dyke's
description of the color of the air in the desert. He goes on for
pages describing minute distinctions in the cast of color the air
gives the landscape, and he manages to describe the effect so
accurately, that anyone who has spent time in the desert recognizes
the truth of Van Dyke's eyesight.
</P>
<P>
   In the chapter ``Desert Sky and Clouds,'' he describes the
stratus clouds: ``This veil of sheet-cloud might be called a
twilight cloud, giving out as it does its greatest splendor after
the sun has disappeared below the verge. It then takes all colors
and with singular vividness. At times it will overspread the whole
west as a sheet of brilliant magenta, but more frequently it blares
with scarlet, carmine, crimson, flushing up and then fading out,
shifting from one color to another; and finally dying out in a
beautiful ashes of roses. When these clouds and all their
variations have faded into lilac and deep purples, there are still
bright spots of color in the upper sky where the (cirrus clouds)
are receiving the last rays of sun.''
</P>
<P>
   The popular objection to purple prose comes from the inexact and
hyperbolic verbifications of inferior scribes, who use the fancy
words in place of having something to say. But when a baroque
literary sensibility, such as Van Dyke's, meets a genuine subject,
the verbal fireworks are, in fact, more accurate, and more moving,
than any calculated understatement. &QL;

CATEGORY.)
</P>
<P>
   If life-extending scientific advances continue at their present
fast pace, the big question for many people becomes:
</P>
<P>
   What on earth to do with that extra 20, 30 or more years?
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next 10 years, there will be a lot of grappling with
what being old chronologically is all about _ and what to do with
those extra years,'' said Marc Freedman, author of a new book about
living longer, ``Prime Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are the views of some of the experts:
</P>
<P>
   _ Bill Arnold, director of Arizona State University's
gerontology program, hopes not to see everyone as greeters at
discount stores. He would like to see cultural changes to make sure
older people are engaged in their careers longer or in new
volunteer activities worthy of their experience and wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anne Lindeman, executive director of the (Arizona) Governor's
Advisory Council on Aging, says people ages 60 and older will have
to stay on the job if we want to keep the economy growing.
Employers won't have the option of phasing out all the 50something
workers, she says, predicting that early retirement will simply
disappear over the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lindeman doesn't foresee the demise of retirement communities,
but she predicts that aging baby boomers may be more interested in
Soho lofts and nearby coffee houses.
</P>
<P>
   _Michael Fossel, a doctor at Michigan State University and
editor of the ``Journal of Anti-Aging Medicine,'' predicts not just
second careers and marriages, but third and fourth.
</P>
<P>
   _Dr. Evan Kligman, who directs the longevity program at Canyon
Ranch health spa in Tucson, Ariz., predicts that there will be more
intergenerational communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more, we will get away from segregating older
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kligman has a hard time imagining the baby boomers being pushed
out of the mainstream, and he predicts that devices at home will
monitor your health systems and tell you when to arrange a
teleconference with your doctors.
</P>
<P>
   _Dr. Andrew Weil of the University of Arizona in Tucson suggests
that future health care may be delivered in spalike settings, with
some areas set aside for high-tech procedures and others for
nutritionists, exercise trainers, acupuncturists and body work
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   _James Birren, associate director of the Center on Aging at
UCLA, says most people haven't caught on yet to the huge change
coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are living 30 years to 50 years longer than at the
turn of the century, but society still thinks decrepitude sets in
at 60,'' the energetic 80-year-old scientist said. ``We've turned
the age pyramid upside down, and our institutions are not ready for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Birren estimates that 10 percent of today's older people are
what psychologists term ``explorers'' _ the elite group who move
into their 70s and 80s at full steam and in good health, driven by
an intense interest in life. Even without further scientific
advances, he predicts, by 2030 about 30 percent of elders will be
in this active group.
</P>
<P>
   Getting everyone into a new idea of what ``older'' means is a
first step, Birren says.
</P>
<P>
   Asked today, most people say they don't want to live to be 100
because they think that means toddering, forgetful and frail. But
that is the old idea of old.
</P>
<P>
   The new definition will come into focus as the good health and
achievements of the . . . shall we say . . . ``very experienced''
people become commonplace. &QL;

 BOOK REVIEW: 
 ``THE LAST DANCE: A NOVEL  OF THE 87TH PRECINCT'' 
 By Ed McBain  (Simon &AMP; Schuster, Inc. $25.00) 
 
 By THOMAS ROPP  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Evan Hunter is Ed McBain.
</P>
<P>
   He's also been Richard Marsten, Curt Cannon, Hunt Collins and
Ezra Hannon.
</P>
<P>
   He was born Salvatore A. Lombino. With his father's blessings,
he legally changed his birth name to Hunter when he began to
publish in the early '50s because at that time there was still much
bigotry against Italian-Americans and it extended to publishing.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Hunter's multiple-name reality is like his layered
career. Under the tutelage of literary agent Scott Meredith, he
sold feverishly to the pulp magazines. Later, he hooked up with
film director Alfred Hitchcock and wrote the screenplay for ``The
Birds.'' But he really wasn't a screenplay writer, nor a
pulp-fiction hack. Hunter knew characterization as well as
brainless action.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, ``Cop Hater'' appeared, the first of more than
four-dozen titles in his bestselling 87th Precinct series.
Featuring Detective Steve Carella (who serves most often as the
author's alter ego), Hunter created an ensemble of characters who
deftly moved in and out of conflict against the backdrop of Isola,
a fictitious megacity that even the most dense readers understand
is Hunter's New York City.
</P>
<P>
   He penned the series with the name Ed McBain. It's the name most
of the world knows him by today because the 87th Precinct was no
ordinary, genre crime fiction. There was a poetry and incisiveness
to the writing that inspired a whole generation of writers and
producers, including those of the enormously popular cop shows
``Hill Street Blues,'' ``NYPD Blue'' and ``Homicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Some would argue that what Hunter writes in his straight novels
(he wrote ``The Blackboard Jungle'' and ``Sons'')``'' as well as in
crime fiction is nothing less than literature, although the
literary community has never embraced him.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone interview from his new home in Connecticut, Hunter
said he's passed the stage of worrying about critics and those who
anoint fiction as literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt early on in my career that I was going to take all the
prizes,'' Hunter said. ``Now I know I'm not going to get the
Pulitzer or the Nobel.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Hunter will be in town at The Poisoned Pen in
Scottsdale for the signing of his newly released ``The Last Dance''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25), the 50th float in the 87th Precinct
parade.
</P>
<P>
   This one is a winner, too, perhaps even more hard-edged and
suspenseful than the series average. What starts out as an apparent
suicide by hanging evolves into a gritty homicide over copyrights
for a major musical production.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said his inspiration came from a musical that he has been
working on over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That, and copyright, was much on my mind,'' Hunter said. ``I'm
a writer, and copyright is the only thing of value that any writer
has in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter is now 73 years old, but his voice has the mellifluous
lilt and mischievous energy of a man half his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do feel great,'' Hunter said. ``You know, inside
every 70-year-old fat lady crossing the street and dodging a bus
there's a 16-year-old kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said a typical day is waking at 8, hitting the treadmill
for an hour while watching the morning news, then breakfast, then
heading off to his in-home office where he writes from 10 till 6,
breaking only for lunch with his wife, Dragica. He said that when
he first began writing, he logged many more hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I vowed if I was ever able to make a living writing, I'd never
work at night or on the weekends again,'' Hunter said. ``I lock
that studio door at six and won't go back in no matter what sirens
I hear beckoning.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was concerned with studies that suggest readers are
disappearing, he replied, ``I'm more concerned that writers are
disappearing.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he can't recommend any up-and-coming crime-fiction
writers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the title of his latest work, Hunter said it will not be
his last 87th Precinct novel. He plans on calling that one
``Exit,'' to be published after he passes on to that big substation
in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I haven't written it yet,'' Hunter said. ``I have a 100
more titles crowding my head, and I can't wait to start writing
them all.''  &QL;

THE VIRTUOUS LIFE, WITHOUT THE RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 RESENDING// 
 
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: STORY ALSO MOVING IN THE ``K'' CATEGORY) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I don't like Bill Bennett. I think he is a very unpleasant man.
In fact, every time I see the former education secretary and ``drug
czar'' on ``Face the Nation'' or ``Larry King Live,'' his smug,
unctuous face makes my blood boil.
</P>
<P>
   There are few faces that scream out louder: sanctimonious prig.
</P>
<P>
   He makes his pronouncements about cultural values with an
insulting certainty, speaking as if he had personally been up on
Mount Sinai getting the tablets from Jehovah. His dicta are as
irritating as those of any name dropper. And if the name he drops
is God's, it is all the more obnoxious.
</P>
<P>
   It is his certainty that bugs me more than anything else. It is
a quality that inhabits a certain kind of male: A certainty that
whatever position he takes is the true one, simply by virtue of his
taking it. It is a very male thing, and reminds me once again that
testosterone is a hallucinogen.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons he makes me so angry is that the cause he has
latched onto is an important one. Our values need to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
   But his version of them is deeply distorted by that inflexible
certainty.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett knows what the virtues are we should maintain: He has
made a list. In his ``Book of Virtues,'' he includes self
discipline, compassion, responsibility , friendship, work, courage,
perseverance, honesty, loyalty and faith.
</P>
<P>
   It seems a measure of Bennett that humility is not among these
virtues.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these seem obvious and inarguable. Others less so. And
in reality, such categorical expectations cannot be convincingly
maintained. There are times when loyalty conflicts with honesty,
times when faith conflicts with compassion. If you are a Sufi
mystic, self discipline may be just the opposite of what you
require. Perseverance is sometimes merely stupidity. Sometimes
diplomacy outranks honesty, for the good of all.
</P>
<P>
   And work, as Bennett outlines it, smells suspiciously of the
Victorian principle espoused by such moralists as Andrew Carnegie
and Henry Ford, who made millions because other people worked long
virtuous hours.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the opposite is truly the virtue. At least Henry Thoreau
made a convincing case in ``Walden.'' ``We are made to exaggerate
the importance of what work we do,'' he wrote. ``But men labor
under a mistake. The better part of the man is soon plowed into the
soil for compost.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans already work like dogs. It is the quality of their
leisure that needs improving.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not the individual virtues on Bennett's list that I
take exception to, but the list itself.
</P>
<P>
   For too often, we think of virtues as being something as simple
as a list: A series of words.
</P>
<P>
   Virtue, for Bennett in his book, ``involves rules and precepts _
the dos and don'ts of life with others.'' In other words, we are
good because we do what we are told.
</P>
<P>
   He reiterates his position in his followup book, ``The Moral
Compass,'' by asserting, ``Moral education must involve following
rules of good behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, virtue is etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I find this view trivializing, and worse, I suspect
that it is propounded merely to perpetuate an economic and
governing system that makes it possible for Bennett and people of
his economic and educational advantage to live comfortable lives.
</P>
<P>
   There are other possible lists of virtues.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic church lists the Theological Virtues of
Faith, Hope and Charity; the Cardinal Virtues of Prudence, Justice,
Temperance, and Fortitude; and the Evangelical Counsels of Poverty,
Chastity and Obedience.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt Bennett considers poverty a virtue.
</P>
<P>
   Or the list in Laurie Anderson's song, ``Forgetting'':
``Bravery, Kindness, Clarity, Honesty, Compassion, Generosity,
Dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Of these, Clarity is the least often observed.
</P>
<P>
   But whichever list we observe is ultimately forced upon our
lives in the style of Procrustes. We are not meant to think about
them, but to obey them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, rules are always insufficient. There are always
circumstances that require our disobeying.
</P>
<P>
   William Blake, for instance, wrote in his ``Marriage of Heaven
and Hell'' how Jesus of Nazareth broke each of the 10 Commandments,
ennumerating them, one by one. Jesus was good, Blake says, because
``Jesus was all virtue, and acted from impulse, not from rules.''
</P>
<P>
   For Blake, Jesus's impulses were good impulses. The rules were
dead and deadening.
</P>
<P>
   He sums it up in one of his ``Proverbs of Hell:'' ``One rule for
the lion and ox is oppression.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Bennett and his followers sum up the good in another phrase
from one of Blake's villains, the shortsighted god, Urizen: ``One
command, one joy, one desire,/ One curse, one weight, one measure,/
One King, one God, one Law.''
</P>
<P>
   As if everyone were a uniform cog in one of Ford's
mass-production lines.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that has happened is a change in the meaning of the
word ``virtue.''
</P>
<P>
   It has meant different things at different times. If it now
means righteous behavior, it once meant something less rigid.
</P>
<P>
   For the Greeks, and later the Romans _ who gave us the word _
virtue meant to be yourself in the utmost. That is, if you were a
soldier, to be brave and fight skillfully; if you were a scholar,
to read deeply and widely.
</P>
<P>
   Each person had his own virtue: to be who he was with every
fiber of his being. Presumably, if you were a villain, you were
virtuous to the extent that you did the most evil.
</P>
<P>
   Ulysses was virtuous for his ability to lie; Achilles for his
ability to kill people.
</P>
<P>
   The best modern equivalent of the term might be
``authenticity.'' Being true to yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtue'' didn't take on its acrid sanctimoniousness until the
Victorian age, when it was used to approve of behavior that
furthered the goals of Colonialism and jingoism.
</P>
<P>
   For the Victorians, virtue meant not having sex. It's a long way
from Achilles to Elsie Dinsmore.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``values,'' that is bandied about so glibly by
politicians now, has also undergone such a change.
</P>
<P>
   It tends to be used by conservative politicians to mean those
narrow and ethnocentric strictures that make life comfortable for
them. ``Values'' means THEIR values. They are something you inject
like a flu shot into your children in hopes it will keep them out
of jail.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there is little that is as basic to our sense of our own
humanity than our values. The question is vitally important.
</P>
<P>
   But before the term was belittled by politicans, our values were
those things we felt had intrinsic worth. They are called values
because we VALUED them; they were things you could count on, like
solid currency. They were not an abstract yardstick to measure
behavior, but rather the very concrete reality on which we built
our lives.
</P>
<P>
   For something to count as a human value, it has, above all, to
be true. Anything else will prove false in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Our values are those things we take as the rock-bottom basic
truths that experience gives us, that we can count on and therefore
can act in the world with the expectancy that particular behaviors
will result in particular outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, our values are not written down on paper
somewhere, but found in the world around us, the world we
experience, the lives we live. And instead of turning out to be as
vaporous as the words of a list, values are as solid as the oak
tree that grows in the yard. Indeed, they may be the oak tree. Or
the birds roosting in it.
</P>
<P>
   Our values include what we believe our families to be, our
awareness of cause-and-effect in the natural world, our sense of
outrage when injustice is aimed at us _ or at someone we share
sympathy with.
</P>
<P>
   If you live in the American South, whether you are White or
Black, the red dirt is one of your values. If you live in New
Jersey, pizza is part of your value system. These are never merely
words, but the truth of the universe you inhabit, as you are given
the ability to see them.
</P>
<P>
   If a so-called value handed down to us is proven false by
experience, we must either forsake the value or live an inauthentic
life. Many of the values Bennett would foist on us no longer ring
true. Perhaps some still do. But we must find them out for
ourselves. It is one of our life's tasks. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Many readers of this article, particularly those at midlife or
younger, probably expect to live through a good half or more of the
new century.
</P>
<P>
   What they may not be counting on, however, is the speed of
medical progress:
</P>
<P>
   Some people who are middle age today, right now, may well live
through the entire &QC; 
21st century and may be reading another article like this 100 years
from now.
</P>
<P>
   The average lifespan was 47 years when the 20th century began.
It is now 76 years, thanks to public health improvements,
antibiotics, vaccinations, heart surgery, cancer treatments and
other breakthroughs. Some scientists say the American lifespan
could double by the end of the century, thanks to fundamental
tinkering with the root causes of aging and disease.
</P>
<P>
   A world of 150-year-olds doesn't mean a world of tottering
frailty: Extended longevity will be the result of robust health,
extending well into the ninth decade of life and beyond. Retirement
will be a quaint notion, some say, as might retirement communities.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 70,000 Americans who are 100 years old or
older. That number has tripled since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   (In Arizona, there are about 500 centenarians, some keeping
schedules that would put 30-year-olds to shame _ such as former
state Rep. Polly Rosenbaum of Globe and Phoenix, who turned 100 in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Based on current medical science and not allowing for any
advances, the number of Arizonans ages 85 and older is expected to
increase to 455,831 in 2050 from 83,381 in 2000.) If this all seems
like an extended pre-death limbo that you're really not looking
forward to, be cheered by the probability that, in this coming
``I'm Dick Clark, You're Dick Clark'' era, things such as wrinkles,
gray hair, old skin, old muscles, old brain cells, old eyes, old
spouses and poor memories could be things you get fixed at the spa
with pills, creams, injections and flavored sorbets.
</P>
<P>
   Although all that may sound like science fiction, there is some
science making some of it likely.
</P>
<P>
   As a new century begins, scientists studying aging are
cautiously optimistic about making major progress soon in
addressing the cause of aging and the diseases associated with
aging. They have had astonishing success in recent years in
increasing the lifespans of laboratory species such as worms and
fruit flies. Genetic advances also offer tremendous potential.
</P>
<P>
   Although some on the fringe of the scientific world are
predicting lifespans of 200 or more within the next 50 years, most
of those doing the more serious aging research _ people who can't
afford to be quoted on the cover of the ``National Enquirer'' _
aren't saying they agree or disagree.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, however, they are beginning to say fairly amazing
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hunch is that there's a 75 percent chance that someone born
today will live to be 150,'' said Steve Austad, a University of
Idaho biologist specializing in aging and the author of ``Why We
Age.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it at a meeting of eminent academic researchers on aging
who gathered last year at the University of California School of
Medicine at Los Angeles to talk about some of the likely advances
in the next 10 to 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   And at that same meeting, the previously unspeakable was spoken:
``Over the next couple of decades, we will be able to unravel the
mechanism of aging,'' said Cynthia Kenyon, a professor of
biochemistry and biophysics at the University of California-San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that with just a few genetic alterations, scientists
have created worms and fruit flies that have lifespans twice the
norm and that die healthy and vigorous _ the worm or fly equivalent
of being 90 and looking 45. Even mice have lived 40 to 60 percent
longer than normal with a simple genetic tweak. Once more is known
about why and how we age, then the work of delaying it could begin.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INCREMENTAL INCREASES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Judith Campisi of the Berkeley National Laboratory at the
University of California-Berkeley, one of the leading experts on
cancer and aging, sees average lifespans increasing in increments,
as the diseases that kill us are eliminated. She isn't about to
predict future lifespans, however. If she underguesses, she'll live
to regret it.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't exactly throw cold water on the happy talk, however:
``I expect we will be able to ameliorate and perhaps reverse some
of the disabling conditions that plague the last decade or so of
human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Stem cell research in particular, she said, offers the potential
replenishment of cells lost due to aging, trauma or disease.
</P>
<P>
   Most age researchers are more excited about quality of life than
quantity of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What many people don't realize is that we are talking about
having 90-year-olds who are as functional as 50-year-olds,'' said
Kenyon, of UCSF.
</P>
<P>
   Quality of life may be safer to talk about because the culture
may not be ready for the idea of more of us living to 120 or
beyond. When Judith Campisi explained to a group in San Francisco
that her aging research could dramatically extend the lives of
people, the problem of overpopulation came up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception that what we are doing is bad for all humankind
can't be ignored,'' she worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is huge hypocrisy around this issue,'' said Steve Austad
of the University of Idaho. ``Some of the same people who respond
that too many people will live too long are lined up at the drug
counters buying melatonin and other supplements purported to have
anti-aging powers.''  &QL; 
ETHICS OF AGING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Arnold, director of the gerontology program at Arizona
State University, worries that without thoughtful discussions now,
only the rich will be able to benefit from some of the scientific
advances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethics will become a major point of discussion where science,
medicine, economics and aging interface,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most agree that major health-policy decisions need to be made
before some of the stem-cell treatments are ready for the market,
which may not be too far off.
</P>
<P>
   For a price, injections will be able to rejuvenate joints,
muscles, organs, skin, even brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, the biggest challenges facing aging America will
be psychological,'' said Ken Dychtwald, a psychologist and author
of the new book ``Age Power.'' ``America has always considered
itself a young nation, a new society _ not an old one.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dychtwald predicts that it will happen: ``We are the
beneficiaries of a Wild West of organ cloning, cyborg body parts,
nutricuticles and biotech manipulations of the biological clock to
the extraordinary extent that some baby boomers will live well past
100 with the look and feel of 50 and 60-year-olds.'' &QL;

<P>
   Humans have long ventured to Antarctica to study and make
discoveries on the icy continent. Now, a new breed of explorer _ a
metallic robot crammed with wires and electronics _ is poised to
add its name to the annals of polar history: Nomad, the meteorite
hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Nomad, a four-wheeled machine built by Carnegie Mellon
University's Robotics Institute in Pittsburgh, is in Antarctica to
see if it can discover something without human assistance. The
achievement would be a first for a robot.
</P>
<P>
   The machine is designed to search rock-strewn areas of ice that
are known to harbor meteorites and pick out the objects that fell
from space from among ordinary rocks and stones. Nomad's builders
believe that the robot has enough intelligence to sort out
information from its sensors and choose the rocks composed of
extraterrestrial material, a job normally done by humans
experienced in meteorite detection. They hope Nomad will discover
at least one new meteorite on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William L. Whittaker, the principal researcher on the Nomad
project, said past exploration robots, like those sent into space
or far down in deep oceans, had been drones that simply transmitted
information for humans to evaluate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, explorative robots have taken pictures, gathered
data and returned what they viewed to scientists who made judgments
and decisions,'' Whittaker said. ``This time, Nomad will make its
own judgments and inferences about the rocks that it encounters. If
successful, it will be viewed as machine intelligent behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomad and a half dozen engineers and graduate students who are
supporting its mission arrived in December at McMurdo Station, the
main U.S. base in Antarctica. The 1,600-pound robot, outwardly
about the size of a Volkswagen Beetle, was taken by helicopter a
week ago to its testing area 180 miles northwest of the base for
three weeks of field trials.
</P>
<P>
   After initial delays caused by severe, windy weather, the crew
set up Nomad's instruments and conducted demonstration runs of the
robot prior to beginning the actual trials.
</P>
<P>
   Nomad is powered by a gasoline-driven generator that supplies
electricity for its computers, communications, scientific
instruments, high-resolution digital camera and propulsion. Each of
its four metal wheels, covered with metal-studded snow tires, is
powered by a separate electric motor.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle, which can expand its chassis to go over obstacles
40 inches tall or use its laser range finder to help go around
them, is designed to move at about 1.5 feet per second as it
surveys an area.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dimitrios Apostolopoulos, a systems scientist at the
Robotics Institute, who is project manager for Nomad, said the
robot would test its skills under increasingly challenging
conditions. Some parts of the test area are flat ice sheets studded
with occasional, distinct rocks while others are moraines, dense
concentrations of rock and rubble deposited by glaciers.
</P>
<P>
   Nomad will search in patterns similar to those used by people
mowing grass, Apostolopoulos said, and use its camera to scan
thousands of rocks for characteristics of meteorites, like shape,
color, luster, size and evidence of charring.
</P>
<P>
   When it sees a good candidate, the robot will move in for
detailed examination with instruments on the end of a movable arm,
including a close-up mini-camera that will look at it from
different angles. Nomad will touch the rock several times with a
reflection spectrometer, which shines a light on the object and
analyzes the spectrum of the reflected light to tell what elements
are present. Then the robot will use a metal detector to sense the
presence of iron, a major component of some meteorites, and do
computations to classify the sample.
</P>
<P>
   If Nomad decides a rock is a meteorite, the robot will radio the
object's exact location to the researchers using coordinates
calculated by the satellite-based Global Positioning System. Later,
people will retrieve the specimen to confirm or refute Nomad's
findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the hundreds or thousands of rocks Nomad looks at, we hope
to get detailed readings on 150 or so,'' Apostolopoulos said.
``Nomad will not only say if a rock is a meteorite or not, but it
also should be able to tell what type of terrestrial rock it is.
It's more than a yes-or-no decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The project, which has so far cost about $3.5 million, is
sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
Office of Space Science, which is interested in sending intelligent
robot explorers to other planets.
</P>
<P>
   On distant worlds, where the simplest, round-trip radio
communication can take hours, it would be impossible for humans on
Earth to guide a robot. Scientists need robots that can fend for
themselves in unknown, hostile environments and that are smart
enough to recognize and assess the unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers at Carnegie Mellon felt that Antarctica would not only
be a good place to test such robots in a distant, harsh
environment, but also offered an opportunity to demonstrate their
ability to do useful work. Conditions on the continent make it a
reservoir for meteorites, and robots could help human searchers
make their limited time there more productive.

   Never bored
</P>
<P>
   With elaborate terrain parks and extensive instruction, Big Bear
resorts directly target a booming snowboarder market
</P>
<P>
   By Eric Noland, Travel Editor
</P>
<P>
   BIG BEAR LAKE -- This is the winter playground of the young and
the reckless: ramps, jumps, boxes in the snow, steel rails that
resemble stairway banisters, steep banks, half-pipes that look like
giant, open-faced tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   At the major ski areas in the San Bernardino Mountains, the
snowboarding terrain park is being expanded, modified, sculpted
into a veritable hill of horrors in order to meet the demands of an
explosive winter-sports segment: youthful adrenaline junkies. (Is
that redundant?)
</P>
<P>
   Boarders comprise about two-thirds of the business at Big Bear's
two biggest resorts, Snow Summit and Big Bear Mountain, and both
tailor their operations accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Instruction from beginner to expert is offered -- accommodating
a growing number of older skiers who are dabbling in snowboarding
so as not to be left behind in the flurry of ice crystals kicked up
by their teen-age children.
</P>
<P>
   Snowboarding combines elements of skateboarding and surfing, and
it proves popular even when the current freakish weather patterns
force local resorts to subsist entirely on man-made snow. Let the
skiers head to the Pacific Northwest for a powder fix. The boarders
are quite content with this hard-pack; it's still softer than the
sidewalk at the base of the public library stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Snowboard instructor Shanon Klaers, 20, of Big Bear Mountain
conducted a tour recently of the Quiksilver Terrain Park, which
this season has added a new, deep half-pipe alongside the existing
one, creating a kind of double-barreled effect.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few minutes of observation revealed the challenge the
resort faces in trying to maintain some semblance of etiquette and
control among the daredevils up there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You watch everybody hurt themselves,'' Klaers said. ``You see
a lot of people who have no idea what they're doing. They see
someone else do something, and they've just got to try it. They end
up eating it really hard. ... They play the snowboarding video
games. They see the professionals. It looks so easy. They come up
here, and instead of trying to just jump over first, they try to do
a 180(-degree spin), or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   And here they came on this December morning. Soaring off jumps.
Skidding along rails -- steel rods that parallel the hill a few
inches off the snow. Plunging into the half-pipe.
</P>
<P>
   Klaers, wearing a gold jacket that identified her as a resort
staffer, took up a position near a rail with a reporter and a
photographer. The group probably looked like some kind of safety
inspection team, because from the chairlift high overhead, a young
voice squeaked, ``You guys aren't taking that rail out, are you?''
</P>
<P>
   The photographer's presence seemed to draw all downhill traffic
like a giant kid magnet. Boarders soared up a short snow ramp,
turned sideways to skid the length of the rail, then invariably
tumbled awkwardly off the end, only to regain their balance with
miraculous ease, if not grace.
</P>
<P>
   Instructors and other mountain personnel encourage the boarders,
especially those new to the terrain park, to take kind of a survey
run down the mountain first, rolling over a jump (without actually
jumping), checking landing areas for sheets of ice, etc. They
preach mountain courtesy -- you're supposed to call out, ``I'm
dropping,'' when you're headed toward a jump, for example, to keep
other boarders from suddenly careening into your path. They
dispense common-sense tips -- not lingering in a landing area after
a fall, since there's a good chance someone else is going to be
airborne above you (and powerless to avoid you) in a moment.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, it didn't appear as if many riders had heeded any
of it.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the Silver Connection ski run that parallels the
terrain park was all but deserted, the loan skier occasionally
carving back and forth across it.
</P>
<P>
   Many skiers, in fact, seemed to be attracted to the bumps and
jumps of the terrain park and joined the boarders in the frolic.
</P>
<P>
   Pro snowboarder Neal Drake, who helped design the park's
features, said this reflects a general trend in downhill sport. ``I
think it's the idea of the mountain not being just flat terrain,''
he said. ``We're trying to make the mountain appealing and more
fun. That's why we're expanding the terrain parks because they're
not just for snowboarders.''
</P>
<P>
   During the recent visit, at least one snowboarder was disdaining
the terrain park for the adjacent run. A teen-age girl, clearly a
beginner, was skidding toward the bottom, mostly on her rump, her
snowboard thrust out in front of her like a brake. A friend was
boarding back and forth behind her, feebly calling out suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   For the resorts, instruction can be a tough sell to the kids,
apparently. Shawn Allsberry, 25, an advanced snowboard instructor
at Big Bear Mountain, said peer pressure can be a factor.
Newcomers, he said, ``come out here with their friends. They
skateboard really well. The friends say, 'Come on, I'll teach you.'
Then they go to the top of the hill and the friends take off.'' It
becomes trial and error thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a day earlier, when a novice class convened at nearby
Snow Summit, the only students were four 40ish guys. Two claimed to
be accomplished skiers whose kids had been after them to learn
something new so they could enjoy the mountain together.
</P>
<P>
   For all of us, the instruction was quite an adventure (cost is
$55 for two hours, including equipment rental and lower-mountain
lift). One of the dads slammed painfully onto his rear -- while
doing nothing more taxing than getting off the chair at the top of
the lift. Another pulled up his parka sleeves to reveal rollerblade
wrist guards. He said he was anticipating a lot of falls and was
taking no chances.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-year-old instructor with inexhaustible patience guided us
through wobbly basics, during which there was a withering assault
on tail bones, wrists, hands, knees and egos.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone old enough to wear reasonably snug pants, it seems,
the sport requires coordination rarely employed in another
recreational endeavors. In skiing, there are four points of balance
-- two skis, two poles. In surfing and rudimentary windsurfing,
which employ a similar parallel stance, adjustments can be made
with the feet (and, in the latter case, the sail) to maintain
balance.
</P>
<P>
   But in snowboarding, your feet are anchored to the board in
clunky boots and unforgiving bindings. Imagine jumping onto a
plastic lunch tray after you've freshly swabbed a kitchen's
ceramic-tile floor. Now imagine your feet strapped to the tray. Now
tilt the floor at a precarious angle.
</P>
<P>
   In snowboarding, you rock onto your heels or toes to cut an edge
and turn. Kids who were on skateboards before they could walk seem
to have no difficulty with this learning curve. A dad in the class
said his son had recently signed up for instruction but mastered
the technique within minutes, bailed out of the class after an hour
and was at the top of the mountain by afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Word has it that when basic balance on the board is mastered,
progress accelerates rapidly. We didn't get there, but there's
always next time.
</P>
<P>
   It's when snowboarders want to start doing some exotic stunts
that things really get interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is Step 1 through 30 steps,'' said Allsberry, the Big
Bear Mountain instructor. ``The more advanced the tricks become,
the harder it is to find someone to take the time to teach you.''
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, the resort has been offering such instruction the
past couple of seasons. The program, called the Great Turns
Workshop, is a bargain -- $5 for 1 3/4 hours (lift ticket and
equipment not included).
</P>
<P>
   Over lunch on the sun deck after delivering a stirring
exhibition of flips and twists in the half-pipe, Allsberry lamented
that ``only about 2 percent of (accomplished snowboarders) who want
to do tricks take on formal instruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounding for all the world like a parent, this seasoned
25-year-old said, ``It's hard to get 17-year-olds to take a deep
breath and think about what they're going to do before they just go
out and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who avail themselves of the instruction are often taken
through a progression of maneuvers of graduated difficulty,
Allsberry said: ollie, moving ollie, switch riding, butters,
straight jumps, grabs, corking, spin tricks, flips, rodeo,
cripplers. (Don't panic over that latter bit of terminology, Mom.)
``If you start getting to chimney spins,'' he added, ``it's almost
too much to digest.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who listen and watch can probably learn a great deal. The
boarders on the hill were certainly riveted this day as Allsberry
performed tricks for the benefit of a video crew and a still
photographer. He was easy to spot as he pulled up short of the
mouth of the half-pipe, wearing his gold staff jacket and white
helmet (he's been wearing one for four years, he said, and hopes
that youngsters follow his lead).
</P>
<P>
   Many of the snowboarders in the immediate vicinity slid to a
stop and sat down in the snow to take in the show.
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion, Allsberry didn't enter the half-pipe directly,
but instead glided for some distance along its rim, dropping in
from a height of perhaps 10 feet. Moments later, he was soaring
into a dramatic back flip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids,'' he said later, ``are really active. They try to learn
how to do these things. You get bored with doing the same thing
over and over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's innate in all of us. Once you learn something,
you push to learn something more.''
</P>
<P>
   In the local mountains, the ever-expanding, ever-more-exotic
terrain parks stand ready to accommodate the urge.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE: The Big Bear Lake ski areas are a 100-mile drive
east of downtown Los Angeles. The most direct route is to follow
I-10 just a few miles past the I-215 junction, then climb into the
hills on Highways 30, 330 and 18 (following signs to ``Mountain
Resorts''). Big Bear Mountain Resort and Snow Summit, both of which
have significant snow-making operations, are the two largest
outfits in the area. Both have extensive instruction and rental
programs.

 UNDATED: more productive.

<P>
   ``Robots are tools, not toys,'' Whittaker said. ``Their success
will depend upon them proving themselves and selling the concept of
their usefulness.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of researchers, including meteorite hunters, descend
upon Antarctica at this time of the year, taking advantage of the
frigid continent's brief summer to study and explore. Since 1969,
scientists from the United States and Japan have collected more
than 20,000 meteorites near certain Antarctic mountain ranges where
they have been preserved in the ice for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   Glacial movements gradually concentrate the space rocks in
discrete areas and push them to the surface, where experienced
searchers can recognize them by their unique outer characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorites collected in Antarctica not only include remnants
from the formation of the solar system billions of years ago, but
also pieces of the Moon and Mars that were blasted away by impacts
with asteroids and comets.
</P>
<P>
   A controversial Antarctic meteorite discovered in 1984
originated on Mars and is believed by some scientists to contain
evidence of primitive microscopic life.
</P>
<P>
   Nomad is being tested at Elephant Moraine, a prime meteorite
collection site on the east Antarctic plateau. Elephant Moraine, so
named because it looks like a small elephant with a long trunk, has
yielded more than 2,000 meteorite specimen during seven previous
visits, going back more than 15 years, by researchers with the
Antarctic Search for Meteorites, or Ansmet, program.
</P>
<P>
   Ansmet, sponsored by the National Science Foundation, has
collected more than 10,000 meteorites over the past 23 years and
made them available to researchers worldwide. Two members of the
Ansmet group who have been searching other meteorite sites this
season are to join the robot team to help verify Nomad's findings.
</P>
<P>
   Nomad and its instruments, which will be taken by helicopter to
the moraine, have been tested on several trial runs over the past
two years, but this expedition marks the first time the robot is
expected to operate completely on its own and deliver useful
results.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, Nomad made a 130-mile trek across a
section of the Atacama Desert in northern Chile while being
remotely operated by researchers in Pittsburgh and at NASA's Ames
Research Center in California. Later in 1997, and again in 1998,
engineers went to the Patriot Hills area of Antarctica to test
components and then the completed vehicle under close human
control.
</P>
<P>
   Apostolopoulos said the Nomad team decided not to take along any
spare parts for major systems, eliminating the possibility of doing
any major mechanical work in the field. ``This is a conscious
decision that forced us to work on reliability, to make the robot
rugged,'' he said. ``We have to make the case that it will work in
space, where there won't be any mechanics around to fix it if
something goes wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ralph P. Harvey of Case Western Reserve University, who
directs the Ansmet exploration operations in Antarctica, said that
having Nomad work in a well-explored area, where most easy samples
have been retrieved, will be a true test of the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey said the human eye and brain were the best instruments
for detecting meteorites among similar-looking rocks, and he did
not see machines replacing humans as primary spotters. However, he
said, robots could have a supplemental role in cleaning up samples
left behind after a human search.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robots don't lose their concentration and are happy to do jobs
that are repetitive and difficult, allowing humans to do something
else that might be more exciting and profitable,'' Harvey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Nomad finds meteorites that we might not recover otherwise,
because other sites have a higher priority, then this is a great
boon. Nomad will be doing real work rather than simply
demonstrating some technology.''

FAMILY SHARES ITS HISTORY OF DISEASE TO HELP OTHERS

   People with familial ademomatous polyposis, or FAP, have had
long, sad family histories. Relative after relative has died of
colon cancer. Parents with their colons removed in young adulthood
passed the disease on to their children, who had the same terrible
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Scruggs, a 45-year-old nurse who lives in Ellisville,
Miss., said that was what happened in her family. The first she
knew of FAP was when her mother died of colon cancer on Jan. 10,
1966, at age 35. Ms. Scruggs, the oldest of five children, was only
10 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't understand until Mama had it that it was all
genetic,'' said Ms. Scruggs. Now, she can trace the disease to her
maternal great-grandmother, who died at 55 from what seems to have
been colon cancer. Doctors had said she was having ``spells'' and
``locked bowels.'' Her grandmother also had colon cancer, as did
her mother's sister.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scruggs, her two brothers and her two sisters developed
polyps. One brother recently developed cancer in his rectum even
though his colon had been removed. Two of Ms. Scruggs' four
children have polyps.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scruggs along with her brother, her sister and her son
joined a study by the Searle pharmaceutical company. Their motive
was to help other people with FAP, she said. ``We can see the
adverse effect it has had on our lives, physically, emotionally,''
she said. ``If we can help one other person, it is worth it.''

CATEGORY.)
</P>
<P>
   If life-extending scientific advances continue at their present
fast pace, the big question for many people becomes:
</P>
<P>
   What on earth to do with that extra 20, 30 or more years?
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next 10 years, there will be a lot of grappling with
what being old chronologically is all about _ and what to do with
those extra years,'' said Marc Freedman, author of a new book about
living longer, ``Prime Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are the views of some of the experts:
</P>
<P>
   _ Bill Arnold, director of Arizona State University's
gerontology program, hopes not to see everyone as greeters at
discount stores. He would like to see cultural changes to make sure
older people are engaged in their careers longer or in new
volunteer activities worthy of their experience and wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anne Lindeman, executive director of the (Arizona) Governor's
Advisory Council on Aging, says people ages 60 and older will have
to stay on the job if we want to keep the economy growing.
Employers won't have the option of phasing out all the 50something
workers, she says, predicting that early retirement will simply
disappear over the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lindeman doesn't foresee the demise of retirement communities,
but she predicts that aging baby boomers may be more interested in
Soho lofts and nearby coffee houses.
</P>
<P>
   _Michael Fossel, a doctor at Michigan State University and
editor of the ``Journal of Anti-Aging Medicine,'' predicts not just
second careers and marriages, but third and fourth.
</P>
<P>
   _Dr. Evan Kligman, who directs the longevity program at Canyon
Ranch health spa in Tucson, Ariz., predicts that there will be more
intergenerational communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more, we will get away from segregating older
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kligman has a hard time imagining the baby boomers being pushed
out of the mainstream, and he predicts that devices at home will
monitor your health systems and tell you when to arrange a
teleconference with your doctors.
</P>
<P>
   _Dr. Andrew Weil of the University of Arizona in Tucson suggests
that future health care may be delivered in spalike settings, with
some areas set aside for high-tech procedures and others for
nutritionists, exercise trainers, acupuncturists and body work
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   _James Birren, associate director of the Center on Aging at
UCLA, says most people haven't caught on yet to the huge change
coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are living 30 years to 50 years longer than at the
turn of the century, but society still thinks decrepitude sets in
at 60,'' the energetic 80-year-old scientist said. ``We've turned
the age pyramid upside down, and our institutions are not ready for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Birren estimates that 10 percent of today's older people are
what psychologists term ``explorers'' _ the elite group who move
into their 70s and 80s at full steam and in good health, driven by
an intense interest in life. Even without further scientific
advances, he predicts, by 2030 about 30 percent of elders will be
in this active group.
</P>
<P>
   Getting everyone into a new idea of what ``older'' means is a
first step, Birren says.
</P>
<P>
   Asked today, most people say they don't want to live to be 100
because they think that means toddering, forgetful and frail. But
that is the old idea of old.
</P>
<P>
   The new definition will come into focus as the good health and
achievements of the . . . shall we say . . . ``very experienced''
people become commonplace. &QL;

THE VIRTUOUS LIFE, WITHOUT THE RULES

 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: STORY ALSO MOVING IN THE ``L'' CATEGORY) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I don't like Bill Bennett. I think he is a very unpleasant man.
In fact, every time I see the former education secretary and ``drug
czar'' on ``Face the Nation'' or ``Larry King Live,'' his smug,
unctuous face makes my blood boil.
</P>
<P>
   There are few faces that scream out louder: sanctimonious prig.
</P>
<P>
   He makes his pronouncements about cultural values with an
insulting certainty, speaking as if he had personally been up on
Mount Sinai getting the tablets from Jehovah. His dicta are as
irritating as those of any name dropper. And if the name he drops
is God's, it is all the more obnoxious.
</P>
<P>
   It is his certainty that bugs me more than anything else. It is
a quality that inhabits a certain kind of male: A certainty that
whatever position he takes is the true one, simply by virtue of his
taking it. It is a very male thing, and reminds me once again that
testosterone is a hallucinogen.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons he makes me so angry is that the cause he has
latched onto is an important one. Our values need to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
   But his version of them is deeply distorted by that inflexible
certainty.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett knows what the virtues are we should maintain: He has
made a list. In his ``Book of Virtues,'' he includes self
discipline, compassion, responsibility , friendship, work, courage,
perseverance, honesty, loyalty and faith.
</P>
<P>
   It seems a measure of Bennett that humility is not among these
virtues.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these seem obvious and inarguable. Others less so. And
in reality, such categorical expectations cannot be convincingly
maintained. There are times when loyalty conflicts with honesty,
times when faith conflicts with compassion. If you are a Sufi
mystic, self discipline may be just the opposite of what you
require. Perseverance is sometimes merely stupidity. Sometimes
diplomacy outranks honesty, for the good of all.
</P>
<P>
   And work, as Bennett outlines it, smells suspiciously of the
Victorian principle espoused by such moralists as Andrew Carnegie
and Henry Ford, who made millions because other people worked long
virtuous hours.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the opposite is truly the virtue. At least Henry Thoreau
made a convincing case in ``Walden.'' ``We are made to exaggerate
the importance of what work we do,'' he wrote. ``But men labor
under a mistake. The better part of the man is soon plowed into the
soil for compost.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans already work like dogs. It is the quality of their
leisure that needs improving.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not the individual virtues on Bennett's list that I
take exception to, but the list itself.
</P>
<P>
   For too often, we think of virtues as being something as simple
as a list: A series of words.
</P>
<P>
   Virtue, for Bennett in his book, ``involves rules and precepts _
the dos and don'ts of life with others.'' In other words, we are
good because we do what we are told.
</P>
<P>
   He reiterates his position in his followup book, ``The Moral
Compass,'' by asserting, ``Moral education must involve following
rules of good behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, virtue is etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I find this view trivializing, and worse, I suspect
that it is propounded merely to perpetuate an economic and
governing system that makes it possible for Bennett and people of
his economic and educational advantage to live comfortable lives.
</P>
<P>
   There are other possible lists of virtues.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic church lists the Theological Virtues of
Faith, Hope and Charity; the Cardinal Virtues of Prudence, Justice,
Temperance, and Fortitude; and the Evangelical Counsels of Poverty,
Chastity and Obedience.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt Bennett considers poverty a virtue.
</P>
<P>
   Or the list in Laurie Anderson's song, ``Forgetting'':
``Bravery, Kindness, Clarity, Honesty, Compassion, Generosity,
Dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Of these, Clarity is the least often observed.
</P>
<P>
   But whichever list we observe is ultimately forced upon our
lives in the style of Procrustes. We are not meant to think about
them, but to obey them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, rules are always insufficient. There are always
circumstances that require our disobeying.
</P>
<P>
   William Blake, for instance, wrote in his ``Marriage of Heaven
and Hell'' how Jesus of Nazareth broke each of the 10 Commandments,
ennumerating them, one by one. Jesus was good, Blake says, because
``Jesus was all virtue, and acted from impulse, not from rules.''
</P>
<P>
   For Blake, Jesus's impulses were good impulses. The rules were
dead and deadening.
</P>
<P>
   He sums it up in one of his ``Proverbs of Hell:'' ``One rule for
the lion and ox is oppression.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Bennett and his followers sum up the good in another phrase
from one of Blake's villains, the shortsighted god, Urizen: ``One
command, one joy, one desire,/ One curse, one weight, one measure,/
One King, one God, one Law.''
</P>
<P>
   As if everyone were a uniform cog in one of Ford's
mass-production lines.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that has happened is a change in the meaning of the
word ``virtue.''
</P>
<P>
   It has meant different things at different times. If it now
means righteous behavior, it once meant something less rigid.
</P>
<P>
   For the Greeks, and later the Romans _ who gave us the word _
virtue meant to be yourself in the utmost. That is, if you were a
soldier, to be brave and fight skillfully; if you were a scholar,
to read deeply and widely.
</P>
<P>
   Each person had his own virtue: to be who he was with every
fiber of his being. Presumably, if you were a villain, you were
virtuous to the extent that you did the most evil.
</P>
<P>
   Ulysses was virtuous for his ability to lie; Achilles for his
ability to kill people.
</P>
<P>
   The best modern equivalent of the term might be
``authenticity.'' Being true to yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtue'' didn't take on its acrid sanctimoniousness until the
Victorian age, when it was used to approve of behavior that
furthered the goals of Colonialism and jingoism.
</P>
<P>
   For the Victorians, virtue meant not having sex. It's a long way
from Achilles to Elsie Dinsmore.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``values,'' that is bandied about so glibly by
politicians now, has also undergone such a change.
</P>
<P>
   It tends to be used by conservative politicians to mean those
narrow and ethnocentric strictures that make life comfortable for
them. ``Values'' means THEIR values. They are something you inject
like a flu shot into your children in hopes it will keep them out
of jail.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there is little that is as basic to our sense of our own
humanity than our values. The question is vitally important.
</P>
<P>
   But before the term was belittled by politicans, our values were
those things we felt had intrinsic worth. They are called values
because we VALUED them; they were things you could count on, like
solid currency. They were not an abstract yardstick to measure
behavior, but rather the very concrete reality on which we built
our lives.
</P>
<P>
   For something to count as a human value, it has, above all, to
be true. Anything else will prove false in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Our values are those things we take as the rock-bottom basic
truths that experience gives us, that we can count on and therefore
can act in the world with the expectancy that particular behaviors
will result in particular outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, our values are not written down on paper
somewhere, but found in the world around us, the world we
experience, the lives we live. And instead of turning out to be as
vaporous as the words of a list, values are as solid as the oak
tree that grows in the yard. Indeed, they may be the oak tree. Or
the birds roosting in it.
</P>
<P>
   Our values include what we believe our families to be, our
awareness of cause-and-effect in the natural world, our sense of
outrage when injustice is aimed at us _ or at someone we share
sympathy with.
</P>
<P>
   If you live in the American South, whether you are White or
Black, the red dirt is one of your values. If you live in New
Jersey, pizza is part of your value system. These are never merely
words, but the truth of the universe you inhabit, as you are given
the ability to see them.
</P>
<P>
   If a so-called value handed down to us is proven false by
experience, we must either forsake the value or live an inauthentic
life. Many of the values Bennett would foist on us no longer ring
true. Perhaps some still do. But we must find them out for
ourselves. It is one of our life's tasks. &QL;

 (RESENDING TO FIX `EDITORS:' LINE  _- EDITORS: STORY ALSO MOVING IN
THE ``LA''
 CATEGORY,  with AGESIDE  sidebar)
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Many readers of this article, particularly those at midlife or
younger, probably expect to live through a good half or more of the
new century.
</P>
<P>
   What they may not be counting on, however, is the speed of
medical progress:
</P>
<P>
   Some people who are middle age today, right now, may well live
through the entire &QC; 
21st century and may be reading another article like this 100 years
from now.
</P>
<P>
   The average lifespan was 47 years when the 20th century began.
It is now 76 years, thanks to public health improvements,
antibiotics, vaccinations, heart surgery, cancer treatments and
other breakthroughs. Some scientists say the American lifespan
could double by the end of the century, thanks to fundamental
tinkering with the root causes of aging and disease.
</P>
<P>
   A world of 150-year-olds doesn't mean a world of tottering
frailty: Extended longevity will be the result of robust health,
extending well into the ninth decade of life and beyond. Retirement
will be a quaint notion, some say, as might retirement communities.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 70,000 Americans who are 100 years old or
older. That number has tripled since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   (In Arizona, there are about 500 centenarians, some keeping
schedules that would put 30-year-olds to shame _ such as former
state Rep. Polly Rosenbaum of Globe and Phoenix, who turned 100 in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Based on current medical science and not allowing for any
advances, the number of Arizonans ages 85 and older is expected to
increase to 455,831 in 2050 from 83,381 in 2000.) If this all seems
like an extended pre-death limbo that you're really not looking
forward to, be cheered by the probability that, in this coming
``I'm Dick Clark, You're Dick Clark'' era, things such as wrinkles,
gray hair, old skin, old muscles, old brain cells, old eyes, old
spouses and poor memories could be things you get fixed at the spa
with pills, creams, injections and flavored sorbets.
</P>
<P>
   Although all that may sound like science fiction, there is some
science making some of it likely.
</P>
<P>
   As a new century begins, scientists studying aging are
cautiously optimistic about making major progress soon in
addressing the cause of aging and the diseases associated with
aging. They have had astonishing success in recent years in
increasing the lifespans of laboratory species such as worms and
fruit flies. Genetic advances also offer tremendous potential.
</P>
<P>
   Although some on the fringe of the scientific world are
predicting lifespans of 200 or more within the next 50 years, most
of those doing the more serious aging research _ people who can't
afford to be quoted on the cover of the ``National Enquirer'' _
aren't saying they agree or disagree.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, however, they are beginning to say fairly amazing
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hunch is that there's a 75 percent chance that someone born
today will live to be 150,'' said Steve Austad, a University of
Idaho biologist specializing in aging and the author of ``Why We
Age.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it at a meeting of eminent academic researchers on aging
who gathered last year at the University of California School of
Medicine at Los Angeles to talk about some of the likely advances
in the next 10 to 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   And at that same meeting, the previously unspeakable was spoken:
``Over the next couple of decades, we will be able to unravel the
mechanism of aging,'' said Cynthia Kenyon, a professor of
biochemistry and biophysics at the University of California-San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that with just a few genetic alterations, scientists
have created worms and fruit flies that have lifespans twice the
norm and that die healthy and vigorous _ the worm or fly equivalent
of being 90 and looking 45. Even mice have lived 40 to 60 percent
longer than normal with a simple genetic tweak. Once more is known
about why and how we age, then the work of delaying it could begin.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INCREMENTAL INCREASES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Judith Campisi of the Berkeley National Laboratory at the
University of California-Berkeley, one of the leading experts on
cancer and aging, sees average lifespans increasing in increments,
as the diseases that kill us are eliminated. She isn't about to
predict future lifespans, however. If she underguesses, she'll live
to regret it.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't exactly throw cold water on the happy talk, however:
``I expect we will be able to ameliorate and perhaps reverse some
of the disabling conditions that plague the last decade or so of
human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Stem cell research in particular, she said, offers the potential
replenishment of cells lost due to aging, trauma or disease.
</P>
<P>
   Most age researchers are more excited about quality of life than
quantity of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What many people don't realize is that we are talking about
having 90-year-olds who are as functional as 50-year-olds,'' said
Kenyon, of UCSF.
</P>
<P>
   Quality of life may be safer to talk about because the culture
may not be ready for the idea of more of us living to 120 or
beyond. When Judith Campisi explained to a group in San Francisco
that her aging research could dramatically extend the lives of
people, the problem of overpopulation came up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception that what we are doing is bad for all humankind
can't be ignored,'' she worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is huge hypocrisy around this issue,'' said Steve Austad
of the University of Idaho. ``Some of the sale who respond
that too many people will live too long are lined up at the drug
counters buying melatonin and other supplements purported to have
anti-aging powers.''  &QL; 
ETHICS OF AGING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Arnold, director of the gerontology program at Arizona
State University, worries that without thoughtful discussions now,
only the rich will be able to benefit from some of the scientific
advances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethics will become a major point of discussion where science,
medicine, economics and aging interface,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most agree that major health-policy decisions need to be made
before some of the stem-cell treatments are ready for the market,
which may not be too far off.
</P>
<P>
   For a price, injections will be able to rejuvenate joints,
muscles, organs, skin, even brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, the biggest challenges facing aging America will
be psychological,'' said Ken Dychtwald, a psychologist and author
of the new book ``Age Power.'' ``America has always considered
itself a young nation, a new society _ not an old one.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dychtwald predicts that it will happen: ``We are the
beneficiaries of a Wild West of organ cloning, cyborg body parts,
nutricuticles and biotech manipulations of the biological clock to
the extraordinary extent that some baby boomers will live well past
100 with the look and feel of 50 and 60-year-olds.'' &QL;

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Kellie Martin's announcement last week that
she'd had enough of ``ER'' came as a surprise only to those who
thought she'd jumped ship long ago. Martin was brought in last
season to inject the aging drama with the youth, vitality and teary
sentiment that's her stock in trade, the stuff she'd brought to
series like ``Life Goes On,'' ``Christy'' and ``Crisis Center,''
where she'd been the marquee name.
</P>
<P>
   ``ER'' was a different monster. It already had big names, not to
mention more viewers than any other series. So after a few choice
introductory episodes, Martin's Lucy Knight, a first-year resident
with a penchant for overstepping her emotional bounds while
tripping over her inexperience, was relegated to the bin of Things
That Aren't Working.
</P>
<P>
   With more new faces to write for this season (Michael Michele,
Ming-Na Wen, Maura Tierney, Goran Visnjic, the Croatian version of
George Clooney) and a heavy dose of guest stars (Alan Alda and
Rebecca De Mornay), ``ER's'' writers, to put it gently, simply lost
Lucy. She was barely there, whizzing through the corridors, being a
bit player in everyone else's bulging story lines.
</P>
<P>
   It happens, producers, writers and stars say: Characters brought
on with fanfare and high possibilities slowly disappear, as what
looked good on paper looks like a failure on the air. Eventually,
producers no longer feel the creative need to have the character at
all, or the star reads the writing on the wall and bolts.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is that more evident than on the rookie drama ``West
Wing,'' which is trying to find airtime for eight regulars. By next
season, both Rob Lowe and Moira Kelly could be gone. Not because
creator and executive producer John Wells isn't satisfied with
their work _ he is. It's because the maximum time given others
leaves them with little to do.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's displeasure with screen time has been the most rumored,
though when confronted the other day about his future on the drama,
he pleaded the Fifth in Hollywoodspeak. (He answered the question
by answering a totally different question.)
</P>
<P>
   Part of a ``West Wing'' panel at the television critics press
gathering in Burbank, Lowe looked painfully glum, rarely cracking a
smile even after the crowd of usually jaded reporters went into
feet-stomping applause for Martin Sheen to do his impersonation of
Sinatra. (He didn't, saying it works only on the set.) The panel
over, Lowe dashed out a side door. Aaron Sorkin, who along with
Wells executive-produces ``West Wing,'' a behind-the-scenes look at
a White House administration, tried to play down the controversy,
saying Lowe had never expressed a concern over story lines. At
least not to him.
</P>
<P>
   Jumping into a sports analogy, as always, Sorkin said his cast
is an all-star team: Everyone is capable of getting the ball, but
they all can't have it at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look. This is an extraordinary cast. It's, you know, a
blessing and curse to have this embarrassment of riches,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So producers go with the ones who will keep making them rich,
which is part of both Sheen's and Lowe's and even Kelly's problem.
Unlike Sheen and Kelly, though, Lowe was brought in as an
``unwritten lead,'' an innocuous billing in which you're part of an
ensemble cast but the series is really being written around you.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Lowe was to ``West Wing'' what George Clooney and
Anthony Edwards were to ``ER'' _ leader of the pack. But here's
what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Sheen's President Bartlett was to be talked about but not seen
(''But we were afraid it would be contrived, like the next-door
neighbor on `Home Improvement,' '' says Sorkin). So the series of
guest spots was conceived.
</P>
<P>
   Then the response to Sheen was so strong that Sorkin began to
wrap story lines around the president. The focus shifted. And it
shows. Lowe's once-promising story line involving a legitimate
relationship with a prostitute has become stagnant, redundant and
insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Miller, a senior vice president for Warner Bros. who
oversees casting for both ``ER'' and ``West Wing,'' says none of
the situations is unique. She confirmed that Lowe was initially
pegged as a centerpiece of ``West Wing'' (''His reading simply blew
us away,'' she says). ``But ... once the shooting starts, things
start to happen with your character and other characters. Writers
discover secondary characters because something great is happening.
And maybe the emphasis is no longer on the person where it
started.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' such a discovery has helped that NBC show
become the funniest sitcom on TV. Because sitcom casts are usually
smaller (''Will &AMP; Grace'' has but four main players), the
possibility that supporting player Sean Hayes would push Eric
McCormack and Debra Messing out the door isn't an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an actor it's a hard thing to talk about because it works
both ways,'' says Hayes. ``It's just that if you're the secondary
character getting a lot of screen time or the lead of an ensemble
getting all the lines, that's great. But when you're the loser,
it's an unfair system.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Miller: ``It's not necessarily the actor's fault, the
writers' fault, the producers' faults. Sometimes it's not the right
choice. Sometimes the show's dynamic changes and those changes
affect everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Moira Kelly says she'll return to her film career. Kellie Martin
is headed back to Yale to finish her senior year. Who knows what's
up with Lowe? Meanwhile, ``ER'' fresh blood Michele and Ming-Na
will roll the dice with the country's No. 1 program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned over the years to take it one day at a time,''
says Ming-Na, making her second tour of duty on the medical drama.
``Even if you get here on time, know your lines, do good work, get
along with your co-workers, your fate is often in the hands of
others. You can't sweat it. Me? I enjoy the ride until the ride is
over. Then I'll go looking for loose change to get on another
one.''

`MOZART: A CULTURAL BIOGRAPHY': OBSCENE CHILD GIVES WAY TO A
METHODICAL GENIUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Publication notes at end of review.)  
(DW) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few artists have been as relentlessly mythologized as Mozart. He
has been portrayed as an emblematic figure of the Enlightenment, as
the Romantic embodiment of natural man, as an irresponsible Don
Juan and as a vulgar, sophomoric vessel for the voice of God.
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``Mozart: A Cultural Biography,'' the scholar
Robert W. Gutman tries to strip away such contradictory legends to
give the reader a down-to-earth portrait of Mozart as a highly
professional musician who used his genius to assimilate and
transform the artistic currents of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Gutman's Mozart, in fact, is a near-antithesis to the ``obscene
child'' depicted in Peter Shaffer's play ``Amadeus'' and a
decidedly happier, better-adjusted man than the one depicted in
Maynard Solomon's 1995 psycho-biography.
</P>
<P>
   Gutman dismisses speculation that Mozart might have been
murdered by the rival musician Salieri or by Masons angered by his
exploration of Masonic mysteries in ``The Magic Flute''; illness
(possibly rheumatic fever), he thinks, ``invaded a system weakened
by overwork.'' He also assails the popular belief that Mozart died
a defeated, disillusioned man, contending that the composer's
precarious finances were ``ameliorating'' in the weeks before his
death and that he ``stood at the high point of his fame'' in his
final months, the ``current of his genius'' flowing ``in full
spate.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the reader, Gutman's cheerful portrait of
Mozart as an ``affectionate and generous man'' who ``played his
role in the human comedy with honor,'' ``goodness of heart,
unaffected charm, winning ways, and self-humor'' fails to grapple
with many of the complexities of the historical record. While many
of the points Gutman wants to make are similar to those made by the
musicologist H.C. Robbins Landon in ``Mozart's Last Year'' (1988),
he does not write with that author's fluency or rigor.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Gutman's assessments of Mozart's inner life feel
platitudinous or contradictory. In one chapter, he writes that
Mozart ``postured as a matter of course'' in his letters, disguise
becoming reflex. In another, he describes Mozart as having ``a
liberated personality'' redolent of the ``equivocal identity not a
few of his operatic characters would insinuate.''
</P>
<P>
   In a third, he asserts that Mozart's character ``remained of a
piece, an intense fusion under control and without Goethe's morbid
strain.'' ``If, as Felix Mendelssohn observed,'' Gutman writes,
``there were many Goethes, there was only one Mozart, steadfast in
his central bent.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Mozart's music, Gutman _ the author of an
earlier book on Richard Wagner _ fares only marginally better.
Although it is clear that he is on intimate terms with Mozart's
oeuvre, he does not use his expertise to communicate the qualities,
texture or magic of individual works: he assumes a large degree of
familiarity, on the reader's part, with the librettos of Mozart's
operas, and he also takes for granted an appreciation of the
composer's symphonic and chamber music work.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, such works are rarely assessed _ or even described
_ in any meaningful way; instead, the reader is simply given an
awkward mix of pedantic asides and fuzzily portentous encomiums.
Gutman writes, for instance, that Mozart's work opens ``vast vistas
of universal moral law and ultimate truth and assumes the quality
of a summons through the Red Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Gutman's book is more useful is in delineating the
cultural backdrop to Mozart's achievement, and the musical
environment in which he came of age. Gutman sketches the
Enlightenment Zeitgeist into which Mozart was born and the
proto-Romanticism that developed in its wake, showing how both
movements unconsciously shaped the composer's developing aesthetic.
In addition he describes how Mozart fluently assimilated the styles
of his predecessors, and in doing so, raised ``German eclecticism
to commanding heights.''
</P>
<P>
   Mozart's development as a composer, Gutman contends, was from
childhood onward ``in no way meteoric, but gradual and
consistent'': he seldom demonstrated ``immediate mastery of the
untried,'' but proceeded by an ``implausibly orderly and
homogeneous process.''
</P>
<P>
   With his ``polyglot vocabulary,'' Gutman goes on, Mozart
gradually began to command ``a style deceptively simple on the
surface but filled with intricacies and elegances, a style of
cultured grace that did not exclude a distilled sensuality so
complex, penetrating and compelling as to ennoble as it seduces.''
</P>
<P>
   As Gutman sees it, Mozart's psychological development proceeded
along a similar arc. Like many earlier biographers, he depicts the
young Mozart laboring under the thumb of his formidable father,
Leopold, who exhibited him ``like a dancing bear'' before the
wealthy and titled. In his 20s, Gutman observes, Mozart rebelled
against his father, breaking away from his tyrannical rule to start
a family and career of his own in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   While other biographers have argued that the shadow of his
father continued to haunt Mozart, Gutman asserts that the composer
possessed ``a strong, balanced core fortified by humor'' and that
he gradually emerged ``from under the mountain of psychological
distress his family had piled upon him.''
</P>
<P>
   His final letters, written while he was composing the Requiem
and the clarinet concerto, Gutman contends, reveal a man ``basking
in praise; busying himself with creating two of the loftiest
productions of the human mind; sending his wife almost daily
messages overflowing with fun, love, and plans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I search in vain for the guttering candle of Mozartean myth,''
Gutman writes; ``to the end, he preserved Candide-like qualities:
evergreen expectations, a passion to love, and muscle to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   That Gutman can reach conclusions so at variance with those of
many earlier scholars not only points up the gaping holes in the
historical record but also underscores the subjectivity of
biography writing, and the contradictory ways in which genius is so
often processed by the clattering machinery of history.

MYSTERIOUS ILLNESSES OFTEN TURN OUT TO BE MASS HYSTERIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Ill., Conn., Calif.)   (Science Times)  
 (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The phenomenon can be frightening and is more common than most
doctors believe.
</P>
<P>
   A person smells or tastes something funny and soon complains of
feeling ill. Minutes later, witnesses also feel strange. The
outbreak spreads like a chain reaction. Many go to a hospital. But
after physical examinations and dozens of blood tests, nothing
significant shows up. Health officials are summoned but find no
cause. A few days later, relapses and possibly a new wave of
attacks may occur. When the all-clear is given, the diagnosis is
mass hysteria, also known as epidemic hysteria, mass psychogenic
illness and mass sociogenic illness.
</P>
<P>
   Stampedes of anxiety can spread rapidly among healthy people.
Outbreaks have occurred around the world since at least the 14th
century. In past eras, some were triggered by thoughts of demons,
possessed states and religious events. Nowadays, the triggers are
usually fears of exposure to hazardous substances and pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, outbreaks of mass hysteria can be difficult to
distinguish from bioterrorism, rapidly spreading infection and
acute exposure to a toxin or other environmental hazard. And rising
public concern about biological terrorism and rapid spread of news
of outbreaks over the Internet are likely to increase the
challenge, if not frequency, of mass hysteria for health officials.
</P>
<P>
   There is no standard definition because the range of symptoms is
so vast. It includes headache, nausea, vomiting, light-headedness,
fainting, anxiety, numbness, tingling and even spasms of laughter.
Although death rarely occurs, if ever, onlookers have summoned
priests to give last rites.
</P>
<P>
   Mass hysteria tends to occur at schools, hospitals, other
workplaces and small communities, and can trickle on for weeks. For
unknown reasons, women are affected more often than men. No one
knows how many incidents occur because they are rarely described in
scientific journals.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Matthew Cartter, an official of the Connecticut Department
of Health, said skeptical editors and scientists rejected a report
of a mass hysteria outbreak that he submitted to medical journals
in 1986. Cartter said he concluded that ``some reports like mass
hysteria are better told as stories than as scientific studies.''
</P>
<P>
   An exception is a 1998 outbreak in a high school in McMinnville,
Tenn., where 170 students and teachers ended up in the hospital,
according to a report in Jan. 13 issue of The New England Journal
of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the costs of caring for patients and investigating
outbreaks, mass hysteria often has political, social and economic
implications. For instance, in Belgium last summer, 250 people,
including many schoolchildren, complained of sickness after
drinking Coca-Cola. The incident prompted the biggest recall (2.5
million bottles) in Coke's 113-year history and cost the company at
least $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Although most children in Belgium recovered quickly, parents say
that some still suffer from headaches, knee pain and exhaustion.
The outbreak ``was no psychological or mass hysteria,'' the
director of one affected Belgian school said, but some doctors
suspect otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, it has had some hallmarks of mass hysteria,'' said
Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the department of preventive
medicine at Vanderbilt Medical School in Nashville and a member of
the team that investigated the Tennessee outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Mass hysteria outbreaks have affected school choruses, day care
centers, jazz festivals, marching bands and train passengers.
</P>
<P>
   A mass hysteria outbreak occurred during a true epidemic of
poliomyelitis in Los Angeles in 1934 when nurses caring for the
patients at Los Angeles County Hospital thought they, too, had
developed polio.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, a flurry of people in Mattoon, Ill., reported becoming
paralyzed after a man squirted them with a gas. The police failed
to catch the man, who became known as the ``mad gasser of
Mattoon.'' In 1956, a report in The Lancet raised the possibility
that staff members of a hospital in London had developed a new type
of encephalitis. But a re-analysis of the cases published in 1970
in The British Medical Journal showed that the outbreak was mass
hysteria, a diagnosis the Lancet authors had not considered.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to distinguish between symptoms caused by poisons and
mass hysteria, doctors seek certain clues. For example, people
exposed to an irritant gas usually cough and have reddened eyes and
irritation of other mucous membranes. But those involved in mass
hysteria generally do not.
</P>
<P>
   Even when doctors suspect that their patients suffer from mass
hysteria, they must examine all to be sure that one or two do not
have an organic illness.
</P>
<P>
   Mass hysteria is generally diagnosed by excluding all known
infectious and noxious agents, a costly process. So, experts debate
whether limits should be put on investigating each outbreak,
particularly when the diagnosis is suspected from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Mass hysteria illustrates the well-known difficulties of proving
and disproving a negative. For example, not doing a thorough
investigation invites concern that the ``true'' cause was
overlooked and possible legal action. Yet because mass hysteria is
such an emotionally charged problem, a detailed investigation that
does not verify suspicions of a poisonous gas may still fail to
satisfy those involved.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Because published reports of mass hysteria have rarely discussed
treatment, doctors are unsure how to tell patients that no organic
cause could be found for their symptoms. The presence of
ambulances, television cameras and workers in protective clothing
can all add to the anxiety, confirming suspicions of a dangerous
situation, experts say. And the anxiety may be rekindled when
officials make inquiries after the symptoms disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Publicity also contributes to the outbreaks. So experts are
uncertain how public anxiety should be alleviated.
</P>
<P>
   A major puzzle is why so few textbooks and medical schools deal
with the phenomenon. Schaffner said he could find only one
reference in standard textbooks, a single sentence referring to the
Salem witch trials. So Schaffner urged his team to publish an
account of the high school outbreak that occurred on Nov. 12, 1998,
to raise awareness of the problem among health workers.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after a teacher said she smelled gasoline in her
classroom at the school in McMinnville, Tenn., she experienced a
headache, nausea, shortness of breath and dizziness. As the
classroom was being evacuated, students and staff members
complained of similar symptoms. A fire alarm was sounded and the
school was evacuated. Emergency medical crews put the teacher and
several students in ambulances in view of other students and
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, 80 students and 19 staff members with similar symptoms
went to the emergency room at a local hospital. For most of them,
symptoms disappeared after they left the school premises and
breathed oxygen. The teacher and 37 others were admitted; doctors
found no organic cause of their symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   After the fire department, gas company, and officials the
National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health found no
problem in the school, it was reopened on Nov. 17. But that day, a
new wave of symptoms occurred, and another 71 people went to the
emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   Government agencies were summoned for an even more exhaustive
investigation. Epidemiologists found that 69 percent of those
affected in the outbreak were female. In comparison, 52 percent of
the overall school population of 1,825 students and 140 staff
members were female.
</P>
<P>
   One-fourth of those affected reported a fever; but an elevated
temperature was documented in only one, and it was 100 degrees
Fahrenheit. Of the 186 ill, 120 or 65 percent reported an unusual
odor at the school and they used more than 30 words such as sweet,
burning and sewer gas to describe it in a questionnaire. Those ill
were from 49 different locations in the school.
</P>
<P>
   But health workers who scoured the premises could identify no
gas or other hazardous substance to account for the symptoms or
odor.
</P>
<P>
   The team did not include a psychologist or psychiatrist because
members did not know one locally with expertise in the problem or
what that person's role would be.
</P>
<P>
   Although those involved in mass hysteria experience real
symptoms, which persist in some, the individuals are usually not
re-examined to determine the long-term effects.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the scientific journal Epidemiologic Reviews in 1997,
Dr. Leslie Boss, a NIOSH official, observed: ``Often no attempt to
understand the illness further is made beyond publishing the
results of the investigation. Failure to do so may result in the
inability of health officials to prevent further outbreaks.''

   Parents to be need help and information _ and new and repeat
parents usually have things they need to buy as well. The Internet
has recognized both of those needs, offering up slates of sites
that combine consumer information and e-commerce with lists of baby
names and offers of electronic gift registries.
</P>
<P>
   One site that does a good job of balancing commerce and
information is BabyCenter (www.babycenter.com). It has plenty of
commercial links _ and offers of free stuff _ from its
infant-centric sponsors Carter's, Beech-Nut, Pampers and others.
But it also offers solid data on prenatal research, stages of fetal
development, relationship issues and other concerns of those who
are parents or want to be. And it has cool interactive utilities,
including an ovulation predictor, a calculator for infertility
risks and weekly newsletters that automatically deliver information
for every week of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Are you aware that . . .

<P>
   January is Cervical Health Awareness Month, intended to raise
awareness of screening for cervical cancer. Pap tests can screen
for the cancer, which is easily treatable in its early stages but
kills 4,800 women in the United States every year. For information

 &HT;    ON THE NEWSSTANDS: Author reflects on freedom in this week's
Book magazine
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Emory University professor Ha Jin talks with Jerome
Kramer of Book magazine about life after winning the National Book
Award for his novel ``Waiting.'' A Chinese expatriate, Ha Jin says
most Americans do not fully appreciate the freedom they have here.
``I think if you travel to another country, you can see the
difference,'' he says. Also of note is an interesting look at books
written by political candidates. Just because every presidential
hopeful feels a compulsion to put his thoughts down in a book
doesn't mean the urge should be acted on, says contributing writer
Marc Herman. Every candidate, it seems, from Gary Bauer to Donald
Trump, has a book on the shelves. Such tomes can backfire, Herman
writes. ``They provide, after all, a public record of a candidate's
beliefs, something politicians aren't always served by.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the vows: Can two very different people make a marriage
work? That's the question Life ($3.99) tries to answer by talking
with couples such as Celine Dion and Rene Angelil and other
seemingly mismatched husbands and wives. There is a 26-year age
difference between Dion and her spouse, but, says the singer,
``Most of the time, he acts more like a kid than me.'' And, in an
introductory essay, Cokie Roberts, co-anchor of ABC's ``This
Week,'' and husband Steven V. Roberts, a political analyst for CNN
and PBS, write about their 33-year ``mixed marriage.'' Cokie is
Catholic, Steve is Jewish. During the December holidays they top
their Christmas tree with a Hebrew star.
</P>
<P>
   The big merger: The newsweeklies are all abuzz about the
AOL-Time Warner deal, but most Americans apparently are not as
excited. According to a Newsweek ($3.95) poll, only 25 percent of
adults say the merger is good for the country, and only 18 percent
say it is good for them personally. Not surprisingly, Time ($3.95)
is more upbeat in its coverage of the deal, but the magazine
attempts to maintain a semblance of fairness with pro and con
viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Art imitates life: Playing a bad-girl character in the film
``Girl, Interrupted'' apparently was not a stretch for Angelina
Jolie. In an interview with Jane ($2.95), the actress talks about
her wild life of drug use and knife collecting, and addresses the
rumors about her bisexuality and eating disorders. And, in a Time
profile, Jolie is described as a ``female James Dean'' by Columbia
pictures chairwoman Amy Pascal.
</P>
<P>
   Bits and pieces: In case you haven't heard, Oprah Winfrey's new
magazine has been dubbed O, the Oprah Magazine, and will debut
April 17 with a circulation of 850,000. The magazine will cover
beauty, fashion, heath, fitness and spirituality and will, no
doubt, feature many covers with Oprah's picture. . . . The great
Cosmopolitan cover-up is under way at Kroger stores, but there are
other mags that deserve to be wrapped as well. The February issue
of Glamour ($2.99) features the usual cleavage cover with teases
touting ``23 Erotic Ways to Make Sex With Him Sweeter'' and ``Sex
and Size: Is He Too Big? Are You?'' Beyond the erotica, however,
there's an informative interview with Vice President Al Gore about
his plan to woo women voters.

THAT DREAD PLACE FROM WHICH NO BUMBLER RETURNS

 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After I expressed my intent to explore an area that strikes
terror of embarrassment into so many hearts, a colleague warned,
``I wouldn't go there if I were you.''
</P>
<P>
   Linguistic exploration rejects such faintheartedness. We will
now deal forthrightly with the cliche that has been embraced by the
squirming squeamish:  &UR; Don't go there &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Its literal sense is of no concern.  &UR; There &LR; , meaning ``a
place,'' can be construed as an adverb modifying  &UR; go &LR;  or a noun in
its own right. But the figurative sense _ of some undiscover'd
country from whose bourn no shamefaced traveler returns _ is what
has gripped the bromide set.
</P>
<P>
   It can mean ``We'd better not talk about that.'' Or ``If our
conversation reaches that subject, you will be uncomfortable and I
will be chagrined.'' Or ``Now you're getting into a touchy
subject.'' Or more severely, ``Beware _ you are approaching a taboo
zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviewing Dan Quayle, the former vice president, last spring,
before he withdrew from the presidential race, the Times reporter
Melinda Henneberger noted this intelligent man's abiding need to
prove he was not stupid. ``Waking up from a nap on the campaign
plane, he asked what I was reading,'' she wrote, ``and it was `Anna
Karenina.' He squeezed his eyes shut, opened them again a second
later. `Russian, right?' Then, a look of relief. Why, oh why, does
he  &UR; go there &LR; ?''
</P>
<P>
   Where is  &UR; there &LR;  in this figurative sense? It is not uncharted
territory; on the contrary, it is a subject area all too well
charted or remembered for its embarrassments by the person not
eager to get back to that place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect this may have had its origin in psychobabble,''
writes Stephen Rosen of New York. ``Where does it come from?''
</P>
<P>
   Let's  &UR; go there &LR; . David Barnhart, editor of the Dictionary
Companion that bears his name (I like that archaic locution),
suggests that the proto-phrase for the expression is ``I don't want
to  &UR; go that route &LR; .'' If so, the meaning has changed from ``way of
getting there'' to ``being there, unhappily.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lexicographic listing I can find is in ``Da Bomb!'' _
the March 1997 dictionary of slang compiled by Judi Sanders'
intercultural communication class at the California State
Polytechnic University in Pomona. It defined  &UR; Don't even go there &LR; 
simply as ``Do not say that'' and the shorter  &UR; Don't go there &LR;  as
``Don't talk about it or mention it.'' ( &UR; That's da bomb &LR; , by the
way, is synonymous with the no-longer-so-cool  &UR; cool &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   Tom Dalzell, the California slanguist, has no citation to offer
but opines that `` &UR; don't go there &LR;  started with black drag queens
and then found its legs with Ricki Lake,'' the talk-show host.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Popik of the American Dialect Society found a 1994 usage
of the imperative warning by the comic Martin Lawrence, talking to
Entertainment Weekly about his Fox sitcom. ``We started using the
expressions `You go, girl!' and ` &UR; Don't go there &LR; !''' Lawrence
said, ``and no one in television was doing that. No one. Now a lot
of Fox shows are using the same stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that its roots and overusage have been exposed, we can hope
for the early demise of the cliche. As Yogi Berra once put it,
``That place is so popular that nobody  &UR; goes there  &LR; anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   POO-TEEN
</P>
<P>
   He may be with us for a while, so let's get his name right: The
acting president of Russia is Vladimir Putin, pronounced POO-teen.
``The stem for Putin's name is derived from  &UR; put &LR; , meaning `path'
or `road,''' notes Albert Weeks, a New York University professor
emeritus now living in Sarasota, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Marat Akchurin of the American Name Society adds: ``The meaning
of  &UR; Putin &LR;  was `the one who was born on the road'; that is, the
mother was traveling when the birth took place. So, within the
current political context in Russia,  &UR; Putin  &LR; could be taken to mean
`transitional.''' Another possible etymology is the verb  &UR; putat &LR; ,
meaning ``to swaddle, bind'' and, by extension, ``to confuse, make
ambiguous, entangle.''
</P>
<P>
   Can it be connected to  &UR; Rasputin &LR; , the derisive name for the
swinging Russian monk, Grigory Novykh, who dominated the court of
Czar Nicholas II? One meaning of  &UR; rasputye &LR;  is ``debauched,'' but
another is ``crossroad'';  &UR; putin &LR;  without the prefix  &UR; ras &LR;  could
mean ``one-track road.'' Be careful not to read too much into this.
</P>
<P>
   NO MORE PATIENTS
</P>
<P>
   How do you get rid of mental patients in one fell swoop? Put a
more caring way, how do you make the mentally ill feel better about
whatever ails them? Call them  &UR; mental-health consumers &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Here's the idea: A  &UR; patient &LR;  is one being cared for; in a
``doctor- &UR; patient &LR;  relationship,'' the doctor has the power. But in
a ``merchant- &UR; consumer &LR;  relationship,'' the consumer is supposedly
king. When you think of health care as a commodity, to be sold by
medical professionals and bought by ailing purchasers of such
therapies, then the patient is a  &UR; consumer &LR; , the boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a respect thing,'' says Frank McMyne, a board member of
the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill. ``It changes the
relationship. If we are merely  &UR; patients &LR; , it diminishes our
ability to question the kind of treatment we are receiving.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Karen Shore, president of the Coalition of Mental Health
Professionals and Consumers, is more conflicted. ``I call my
patients  &UR; patients &LR; . But to a lot of people who are consumer
advocates,  &UR; patient &LR;  sounds pejorative.''
</P>
<P>
   Her associate Sheri Laribee adds: ``What  &UR; consumer &LR;  stands for
is `someone on a health care plan.' If I am paying for the managed
health care plan, I am the consumer buying insurance. The
managed-care organizations call people  &UR; consumers &LR;  so that they
don't have to think of them as  &UR; patients &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Useless euphemism or realistic relabeling? We're onto a
linguistic-political controversy here. Comments from treaters and
treatees will be welcomed at Safire On Language, New York Times
Washington Bureau, 1627 I St. NW, Washington, DC 20006 or at
onlanguage(AT)nytimes.com. (If you have to wait for a reply, be

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   The frigid air over New England will moderate Tuesday as
sunshine and lighter winds combine with slightly milder air aloft.
A complex front approaching from the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley
should produce snow showers in Ohio, western New York and
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   One center of low pressure will remain near Lake Superior,
producing light to moderate snow in upper Michigan. A new low will
develop in eastern Tennessee causing a wintry mixture from the
southern Appalachians to the Carolina coast. Light snow will cover
parts of Virginia and the higher terrain of the western Carolinas.
Sleet and freezing rain will glaze sections of the central and
eastern Piedmont plateau from northeast North Carolina to northeast
Georgia. The coast will notice occasional cold rain mixed with ice
pellets.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure in the central Plains will be associated with a
mixture of Pacific and polar air. Temperatures will be
near-to-above seasonal levels. A surge of arctic air will reach the
border states Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   A stream of moisture from the Pacific will bring clouds and
showers to much of the West Coast and the central Rockies. Winds
ascending the eastern Rockies should combine with high-level
moisture to induce showers in Kansas Tuesday afternoon. Valley rain
and mountain snows will be common in the southern two-thirds of
California and across parts of Nevada, northern Arizona, Utah and
western Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Gales and rain will approach the Northwest coast as an offshore
storm pushes slowly eastward.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Direct Discharge
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning saw the temperature dip to 8 degrees at Central
Park in New York, the lowest reading since January 19, 1997. The
afternoon temperature struggled to reach 16, making it the lowest
daytime temperature there since a cold wave in January 1994. The
entire Northeast shivered as a mound of arctic air plunged directly
south from Quebec. Air masses that follow this trajectory are not
modified by their passage over the Great Lakes, nor are they
tempered by a long descent from the peaks of the Appalachians.
Moderation is expected Tuesday.

&HT;     OLYMPIC FAME HAS FADED, BUT LAKE PLACID REMAINS A WINTER
HAVEN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TIM REYNOLDS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. _ The streets have not bustled with this much
anticipation in 20 years, the natives of this tiny Essex County
village will tell you. Banners and signs that welcome the world are
as omnipresent on Main Street as the icicles that hang off
rooftops.
</P>
<P>
   As you stroll down the narrow, curvy main artery of Lake Placid,
a village with some 2,500 residents, you can't help but wonder how
similar it is today to the Olympic years of 1932 and 1980, when the
eyes of the world's winter sports enthusiasts were focused here.
</P>
<P>
   Those eyes have wandered past Lake Placid in recent years, its
luster usurped by places such as Calgary, Nagano, and Salt Lake
City. In the 1990s, international competitions always seemed to be
headed elsewhere, leaving youth hockey tournaments to fill the void
in Lake Placid.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, the down period that followed the 1980 Olympics
appears to be ending. Lake Placid is part of history, but it isn't
history. Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an evolution,'' said Ted Blazer, president and chief
executive officer of the Olympic Regional Development Authority.
``But I don't know if I would call it a resurgence.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, the inaugural Winter Goodwill Games begin here, the
biggest on a list of big events that have marked Lake Placid's
reemergence on the international winter sports scene. First there
was the U.S. Ski Team Gold Cup two years ago, then an Ironman
triathlon and a World Cup biathlon event last year. Future events
include the inaugural Winter National Senior Games Feb. 29-March 3,
the ESPN Great Outdoor Games this summer, and the bobsledding world
championships in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``Selfishly, I think we're still the winter sports capital of
the world,'' said the village's mayor, T. James Strack, himself a
former competitive bobsledder. ``If you come here, see the ski
jumps and Whiteface Mountain and the new bobsled run, how could you
not say that? We can handle anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Lake Placid first achieved notoriety as a vacation spot for the
rich and elite, and soon after as a winter sports wonderland, a
distinction it has held for seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   But not even the surrounding 46 mountains in upstate New York,
the mammoth earthy mounds that compose the High Peaks of the
Adirondacks, could protect Lake Placid from ebbs and flows of
success along the way. It is a two-time Olympic Winter Games host,
one of only three places in the world with that distinction, but
the residual benefits of being an Olympic city last only so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last four or five years, maybe longer, there's been a
real effort on the part of elected officials to make people aware
how difficult it is to survive in the Adirondacks economically,''
said James McKenna of the Lake Placid Visitors Bureau. ``Sports
seem to mix with the Adirondacks pretty well, and it was a matter
of figuring out how to use sports as an engine to cultivate more
economic activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, thoughts like those weren't necessary. The
1980 Olympics were the stuff of legend, with Eric Heiden's five
speedskating gold medals and the scintillating run by the
miracle-making U.S. ice hockey team secure in American sports lore.
</P>
<P>
   But those memories alone couldn't keep Lake Placid fresh in
people's minds. Instead of moving forward, Lake Placid was falling
off the winter sports radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of that concern,'' Blazer said, ``came determination and
drive to not let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The venues that separated Lake Placid from the rest of the world
were, in some cases, literally falling apart. Construction of
second homes and condominiums, a trend that exploded in Lake Placid
during the 1980s, essentially ceased in the early 1990s. These were
all bad signs for a village of 3,000 that has an unemployment rate
twice the national average, and where one in five families lives
below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started coming here 10 or 11 years ago, Lake Placid
was a nice little resort town with an Olympic reputation,'' said
Barbara Harubin, a Johnson City resident whose husband, Edward,
runs a summer fishing-tour business in the Lake Placid area, and
whose family vacations in Lake Placid during the winter. ``Then it
seemed like its time had passed, but now it's exciting again.''
</P>
<P>
   Strack disagreed with the notion that Lake Placid's time had
ever passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were never in financial trouble; we were in recognition
trouble,'' said Strack, who pointed to lack of marketing and lack
of facilities upkeep as the two factors that led to the village's
failure to attract major sporting competitions. ``We've got a gold
mine here, and we had to put some money back into it to get the
word out again.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS. &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lake Placid bid unsuccessfully for the 1992 Olympic Winter
Games, the first blow the village took in the winter sports arena.
Once folks realized that another Olympic year is a long way off, if
ever, they started to get creative with marketing strategies.
Blazer pointed to the Gold Cup, which served as the U.S. Olympic
skiing trials in 1998, as the type of event that Lake Placid would
like to land consistently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fulfilled their needs before the Olympic period,'' Blazer
said. ``And it fulfilled ours _ a multisport event which was
televised. So the event was created. And I think there's a lot of
opportunity like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer's Ironman triathlon fit that bill, as do these
upcoming Goodwill Games, which local officials estimate could pump
$12 million into the Lake Placid region.
</P>
<P>
   Blazer, ever the optimist, points to the upcoming events as
proof that Lake Placid's lull is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other place in the world has an edge on Lake Placid now,''
Blazer said.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic sites such as Chamonix, St. Moritz and Squaw Valley fell
off the list of competitive winter sport havens long ago. Venues in
Sarajevo were destroyed by a war, and venues in Albertville were
dismantled almost as soon as the final gold medal was awarded there
eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Here, though, the village clings to its Olympic heritage, a
distinction that separates it from its similar-sized neighbors in
the hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that always kept us going was our Olympic Training
Center, which always kept the athletes coming here,'' Strack said.
``As long as we could keep that thing active and going, there was
always hope that someone would see the beauty of the area and the
facilities we have here.''

IN MANY WAYS, 1900 WAS A DOPPLEGANGER OF 2000
</HEADLINE>

By J.R. LABBE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram

   ``Change had come so fast and had been so radical no one seemed
certain where reality stopped and fantasy began.''
</P>
<P>
   Observations at the dawn of the year 2000?
</P>
<P>
   No. It's documentary writer and producer Judy Crichton's
observation about the dawn of 1900 from her book, ``America 1900:
The Turning Point.''
</P>
<P>
   PBS recently rebroadcast its three-hour documentary based on
Crichton's 1998 book. The parallels between the last year of the
19th century and what the United States is experiencing now, the
waning days of the 20th century, are downright eerie.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   1900: Publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst predicts that
``the powers of the wind, the sea, the rivers and the sun will be
chained _ so that the air will no longer be fouled with smoke for
which men have worn out their lives in coal mines.''
</P>
<P>
   2000: If only ol' Willie had been correct about what was to
come, because America is still wrestling with air fouled with smoke
_ and ozone, and nitric oxides, and sulfur dioxide, and particulate
emissions, and ...
</P>
<P>
   Technology has helped reduce the number of men wearing out their
lives in coal mines, but not this country's dependence on fossil
fuels.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   1900: One of the technological advancements that was supposed to
help with that fouled air debuts on New Year's Eve in the streets
of Boston: electric cabs. But the use of electric-powered vehicles
is impractical beyond a few major cities for a plethora of reasons,
premier among them lousy roads (there were only 10 miles of
concrete road in America in 1900) and a lack of access to
recharging facilities.
</P>
<P>
   While most urban areas are rapidly installing electrical
infrastructures, primarily to replace gas street lamps so they
could take human lamplighters off the city payroll, electricity in
the home and even in many businesses is not common. (Many New
Yorkers fear they will be electrocuted in their beds when the lines
are run into their houses). Rural electrification worth noting
doesn't occur for another 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity is expensive, and gasoline _ basically a waste
product of petroleum that is often burned off at the wellhead to
get to the kerosene for lamps _ is cheap. At 5 cents a gallon, it
trumps electricity's cost of more than 20 cents per kilowatt-hour.
</P>
<P>
   And believe it or not, gas-powered vehicles are considered a
leap forward in environmental and community health. Remember, they
are replacing the horse, whose byproduct stinks, attracts
disease-carrying flies, creates a dust that contributes to
respiratory problems and eye irritations, and makes the streets a
slippery mess when it rains.
</P>
<P>
   2000: Electric cars are re-emerging in the transportation
industry in large part because of the growing environmental
concerns of consumers. As the federal government continues to
threaten sanctions on urban areas that aren't doing enough to clean
up the air, consumers are increasingly calling for clean, green
alternatives to gas-powered cars.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Ford Motor Co. announced that it will soon sell a
plastic-bodied, hatchback car powered by electricity. Called the
Th!nk City, the car reportedly can travel at 55 mph. Ford already
sells electric versions of the Ranger pickup, and General Motors
offers an electric version of its EV1 coupes. The price on most
electric vehicles, however, is still big enough to choke a horse.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   1900: The election campaign of 1900, with President William
McKinley and challenger William Jennings Bryan heading up the dance
card, is the most ambitious and expensive in history. The contest
costs more than $5 million; add in the congressional campaigns, and
the estimate is more than $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   2000: One candidate alone in this year's presidential election
has raised three times what was spent on all the congressional
races 100 years ago. Texas Gov. George W. Bush has a campaign war
chest of $67 million _ and counting.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and Democratic challenger Bill Bradley
have raised $24 million and $19 million, respectively. Republican
candidate Steve Forbes came into the race with $16 mil of his own
money. Add in the funds for McCain, Hatch, Bauer and Keyes ... and
they called the 1900s the Gilded Age.
</P>
<P>
   It's too soon to tell what the final tab will be _ the first
primary doesn't roll around until Feb. 1 _ but what do you want to
bet that historians will be able to write, ``The election campaign
of 2000 was the most ambitious and expensive in history''?
</P>
<P>
   Which leads us to ...
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   1900: One political analyst, commenting on the need for campaign
finance reform, concludes that even ``if a presidential candidate
was nominated only to reform this very system, his managers to
elect him would have to spend millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   2000: Reform seems just as unlikely in 2000 as it appeared in
1900. Presidential hopefuls John McCain and Bill Bradley attempted
to make a bipartisan push against soft money in this year's
high-stakes race by co-hosting a most unusual news conference in
New Hampshire. Both men cast aspersions on the current campaign
finance system and pledged to work for reform.
</P>
<P>
   The problem remains that precious few other pols are willing to
work with them. Americans would be wise to maintain their
skepticism about the promised disappearance of big bucks from the
political scene in this lifetime.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   1900: Bryan, a former U.S. representative from Nebraska, runs
against President McKinley _ for the second time _ on an
anti-imperialism platform.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Bryan lambastes McKinley for buckling to the media hype
and consequent public outrage over the deaths and suffering caused
by the stalemate between Spanish forces and revolutionaries in
Cuba. McKinley's intervention, the 100-day Spanish-American War,
sees the U.S. destroy the Spanish fleet in Santiago Harbor, seize
Manila and occupy Puerto Rico. The U.S. eventually annexes the
Philippines, Guam and Puerto Rico, which become the country's first
foreign holdings.
</P>
<P>
   2000: Reform Party presidential candidate Pat Buchanan is
running on a protectionist, isolationist platform that would make
Bryan bust his buttons.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is ``replicating, with alarming exactitude,
the course that brought the British Empire to ruin,'' writes
Buchanan in his book ``A Republic, Not an Empire.'' Buchanan
contends that the nation suffers from compulsive interventionism,
and he even harks back to McKinley's days in office when the
country got involved in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   His hero? William Jennings Bryan, who lost in his presidential
bid against McKinley and quit as President Wilson's first secretary
of state when he thought Wilson was preparing for war.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   1900: The United States gets more than banana plantations and a
multi-island paradise when it annexes the Philippines. Manila is
viewed as the gateway to China, a flowering economic opportunity
just waiting to be plucked by American coal, oil and railroad
barons with money to burn. With a population of 500 million, China
is eyed with capitalistic hunger by megacorporations as the next
big export market.
</P>
<P>
   2000: My, how time doesn't change everything. Free-traders are
pushing hard for China's inclusion in the World Trade Organization,
and for Congress to approve permanent normal trade relations with
the communist country. With a population of 1.2 billion, China is
being eyed with capitalistic hunger by megacorporations as the next
big export market.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   1900: Americans with money are ordering groceries by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   2000: DotComGuy is being paid by corporate sponsors not to leave
his apartment for a year, ordering everything he needs by Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Big deal. This would have been news had it taken place even 10
years ago instead of today. Anyone with a telephone line, a
computer modem and a street address can do this in 2000.

SAFE BUT FUNNY `RIVER' RUNS THROUGH EL PORTAL
</HEADLINE>

(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
 
 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH HOLLYWOOD _ A new theater opening can be like one of those
festive family get-togethers where nobody wants to mention that the
conversation is a bit predictable and the cuisine is on the lean
side.
</P>
<P>
   So it was at Friday's coming-out party for the El Portal Center
for the Arts, the beautifully reconfigured 1920s movie palace that
aims to become the crown jewel of the bustling NoHo Arts District.
Goodwill and high spirits flowed freely as the opening-night crowd
of well-wishers oohed and aahed at the sinuously elegant complex,
which should be fully up and running by February.
</P>
<P>
   It may take longer, though, to get a solid fix on the new
center's artistic agenda. To launch its inaugural Mainstage season,
the El Portal is presenting ``Over the River and Through the
Woods,'' a warm and fuzzy domestic comedy by Joe DiPietro, the
Norman Rockwell of under-40 contemporary playwrights. While in some
ways this valentine to Italian-American family values makes for a
safe, suitable choice to christen the new theater, it was clear
from the wobbly acoustics that the 390-seat Mainstage _ the largest
of the El Portal's three peformance venues _ still needs some
fine-tuning. A drop ceiling may be necessary to keep the actors'
voices (miked, Friday night, to little avail) from bouncing around
the cavernous interior.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Asaad Kelada's production of DiPietro's good-natured
comedy is as solidly crafted as set designer D. Martyn Bookwalter's
sprawling imitation of an aging Hoboken, N.J., household, where the
entire play is situated. Like the play itself, that towering set is
a modest idea writ large.
</P>
<P>
   It's here that Nick Cristano (Stuart Fratkin), 29 and single,
has come to break the bad news to his two sets of grandparents that
he's getting a promotion and moving to Seattle. To his proudly
parochial relatives, who regard Chinese food as a culinary
conspiracy and VCRs as a high-tech plot, the rainy West Coast city
might as well be on Mars. Why does their beloved grandson want to
fly the coop when everything he could want _ love, understanding,
homemade ravioli _ is right there in his back yard?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tengo famiglia'' _ ``I have family'' _ intones Nunzio (an
admirably low-key Joseph Campanella), the wryer of the two
white-haired patriarchs (Joseph Cardinale is the other). This
phrase becomes the play's mantra as the grandparents hatch a scheme
transparently to keep Nick's apron strings tied by matching him up
with a nice Irish-American lass. Shannon O'Hurley's bright-eyed,
slightly offbeat performance in this by-the-book role helps spice
up a script that sometimes mistakes the generic for the universal.
</P>
<P>
   So, also, does the smooth, understated professionalism of
Campanella, co-star Carol Lawrence (looking smashing), and
Cardinale and Erica Yohn as Nick's maternal grandparents. Fratkin,
meanwhile, finds just enough self-centered arrogance to put a
wrinkle or two in Nick's gee-whiz affability.
</P>
<P>
   Less a tightly interlocking sequence of events than a series of
convivial set pieces, ``Over the River'' is an affectionate,
forgiving look at one man's past _ and a hopeful glimpse of his
future. Like Neil Simon, DiPietro's comic gift lies not in what he
has to say about life but in how he says it _ with a generous gift
for inducing laughter and a kind word for all. Let that serve as a
blessing for L.A.'s newest theatrical family. &QL;

MURDEROUS STUDENT, AMOROUS TEACHER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: In this story, tonight is Tuesday. Fact box below) 
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Violence and sex _ between students and teachers _ are both
too-frequent tragedies in high schools these days, disquieting
social ills that provoke much hand-wringing in lieu of unearthing
actual solutions, yet Hollywood treats them in wildly divergent
fashion. An episode of ``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer'' was struck
from the WB's schedule for a time last year because of fear of
copycat behavior _ odd, since the violence in the episode concerned
a giant serpent terrorizing the school's halls, something even the
most inventive anarchists are unlikely to replicate. Meanwhile,
sexual relationships between students and teachers are fodder for
two upcoming midseason replacement sitcoms _ ''M.Y.O.B.'' and
''Brutally Normal.''
</P>
<P>
   And both issues are exploited this evening as prurient
entertainments with little interest in mining the sociological
underpinnings of the real-life tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   First up is the usually reliable PBS series ``Frontline'' with a
titillatingly titled episode, ''The Killer at Thurston High,''
about Oregon teen murderer Kip Kinkel. There's not a lot of
material here that wasn't in reports that soon followed the
shocking murders, though what's added is admittedly chilling _ the
recording of Kip's distraught admission of guilt, police videotape
of the crime scene. Outside of emphasizing Kip's fondness for the
romantically violent, hyper-charged film version of ``Romeo and
Juliet'' starring Leonardo DiCaprio, however, this report fails to
provide much context or elucidation for concerned parents wondering
if there's a time bomb ticking in their own home.
</P>
<P>
   Which is the fear correspondent Peter J. Boyer immediately
raises, grimly intoning, ''Some of us are raising killers in our
own homes.'' At points in this recounting, Boyer sits in an SUV in
a rainstorm, looking fatuously reflective as his deliberate,
monotonous voice-over narration, ponderously slow to the point of
somnolence, metes out the facts.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with Kinkel family friends, as well as Kip's
sister Kristin, who was away at college when the tragedy occurred
and puts a curious, heartbreakingly perky spin on her recollection
of events, we're shown the inexorable steps toward calamity. Kip's
father, Bill, a respected teacher, watches, bewildered and
exasperated, as his underachieving son grows ever more moody; he
makes the fatal mistake of trying to assuage his teen's angst by
putting guns in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Kip had a fair number of friends; nonetheless, his diary is
filled with the usual sort of urgent self-doubt that most
teen-agers must endure. So what turned him from standard-issue
disaffected teen to national headline?
</P>
<P>
   It turns out, Boyer anti-climactically admits despite all his
concerned in-truck emoting, that Kinkel is an anomaly after all:
Despite the high drama employed in re-creating the heinous crime,
it boils down to the fact that he was tormented by voices in his
head. It recalls Chris Rock's pointed take on extracting the
societal reasons for school shootings: ''Whatever happened to
'crazy'?'' As the subsequent massacre at Columbine proved, there
are individuals so unhinged that no amount of sensitivity training
or good parenting or school policing can stop them. These virulent,
gun-toting basket cases are a disastrous side effect of the freedom
our country proudly embraces, but if we succumb to paralyzing fear
and ineffectually alter our lives to avoid perceived dangers, we've
lost our freedom anyway. &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Tonight also finds the USA Network airing a docudrama on Mary
Kay Letourneau, the educator who violated a student's civil rights
by championing the cause of statutory rape. Oddly enough, the
filmmakers actually put a little care and thought into their
production, though not enough, of course. The full title and ad
campaign _ ''The Mary Kay Letourneau Story: All-American Girl,''
with two figures on a school crossing traffic sign, the taller,
skirted one cozying up to the other _ suggests an only-in-America
satire along the lines of the HBO classic, ''The Positively True
Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader- Murdering Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriter Julie Hebert and director Lloyd Kramer, however,
have opted for a more serious, although ultimately unsatisfying
approach. They want to address the issue seriously _ specifically,
if the victim doesn't feel victimized, was a crime committed?
However, since Letourneau apparently participated in some fashion
with the production, their take seems a smidgen suspect. Certainly,
there's no quicker way to make your subject seem sympathetic than
to throw her against a prison backdrop filled with rapists and
child abusers, which is how this film opens.
</P>
<P>
   Penelope Ann Miller plays Letourneau, who was reared in a
stringently conservative family and, the film suggests, willingly
submitted to sibling incest in her teens. Hebert and Kramer are
vague about the particulars of her marriage _ she and hubby Steve
(Greg Spottiswood, who looks almost as young as the kid she
seduces) were forced to marry when she got pregnant; it was a
loveless marriage that somehow nonetheless produced four children.
Money seems to have been an issue in there somewhere but is
addressed only muddily; such are the vagaries when dealing with a
real-life story that includes people who are still around and able
to sue over their depictions.
</P>
<P>
   Letourneau encounters Vili Fualaau (Omar Anguinano in a cagily
insightful performance), a troubled student with, allegedly, the
soul of an artist, while he's in sixth grade. He flirts with her
and brags to pals that he'll seduce her; their families become
friendly, and they become extremely friendly. Again, the film
cheats in Letourneau's favor _ Anguiano looks far older than 13,
the age at which Vili and Mary Kay began sleeping together.
Anguiano, in fact, looks legal; couple this with Miller's own
youthful demeanor (she's playing a 35-year-old), and audiences are
invited to ask: So what's the big deal?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it doesn't matter how old the guy looked, he was still 13
_ and therefore still lacking in the social graces that Letourneau
thrust upon him, whether he was willing or not. He may not feel the
effects of what has been done to him until he's a fully grown man.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers create a crafty portrait of Mary Kay _ part
romantic ditz, part legitimately psychologically imbalanced young
woman _ and this plays guilefully well to Miller's abilities,
though she's not anyone's idea of an accomplished actress (``The
Shadow,'' anyone?). She essays her subject as something of a
giggly, goofy and insecure drama queen who enjoys all the
attention, if for all the wrong reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Letourneau'' doesn't really provide much insight into
the case, it likewise doesn't waste one's time or aggressively
insult one's intelligence. Leave that to the gratuitous round-table
discussion following the movie. The lurid story's principles,
including Letourneau, via satellite from prison, will be featured
in a live (on the East Coast, at least) forum. No word on whether
the host will be Jerry Springer or Sally Jessy Raphael. &QL;

&HT;     SERVICE MARKS ANNIVERSARY OF CONTENTIOUS LESBIAN UNION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CAROL NESS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Two weeks before a hearing that could put
them on trial, a group of United Methodist ministers has publicly
reaffirmed their audacious blessing of a lesbian couple a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The service, held Saturday in Sacramento's Memorial Auditorium,
celebrated the anniversary of the ``holy union'' of Jeanne Barnett
and Ellie Charlton. It also cast a spotlight on the upcoming
hearing and on a California ballot initiative against gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here to honor Jeanne and Ellie, who stuck their necks
out last year and publicly proclaimed their love for each other in
the midst of a homophobic society,'' said the Rev. Don Fado, the
Sacramento pastor who led 67 other Methodist clergy in the ceremony
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are also here ... to make our statement to the world
again,'' added Fado, pastor at St. Mark's United Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   The union ceremony made national waves because of the number of
ministers who put their jobs on the line in opposing the Methodist
policy banning such blessings for same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   The action also divided the Methodist Church on the issue of
homosexuality. And it sparked a complaint against the 68 pastors,
all active and retired clergy in the California-Nevada Conference
of the United Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   While both the Sacramento-based conference and its bishop,
Melvin Talbert, are on record supporting full equality for
homosexual church members, the complaint launched legal proceedings
within the church that could lead to a mass trial.
</P>
<P>
   A three-day public hearing, by the church's Committee on
Investigation, starts Feb. 1 to determine whether formal charges
will be brought against the pastors, who now number 67 after the
death of one last August.
</P>
<P>
   Before Saturday's service, attended by 25 of the pastors plus
about 200 supporters, Fado said he hoped the hearing would provide
an opportunity for a ``full airing of the issues pro and con.''
</P>
<P>
   During the service, he spoke out strongly for full equality for
gays within the church, calling the position of the 68 pastors the
revolutionary equivalent of the Boston Tea Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's throw out all the T's,'' Fado said, including the ``T
for the totalitarianism that requires others to conform to any one
theology.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett and Charlton, in the twin purple appliqued sweaters they
wore for last year's ceremony, sat to the side and were applauded
by the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's service was a smaller, quieter version of the one
last year, featuring music, speeches, a procession by the pastors
and a poem and song written especially for the couple.
</P>
<P>
   Notaries were on hand to sign up couples as domestic partners
under the new state registry law. And opponents of the March ballot
initiative were gathering donations and seeking volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, Proposition 22, would outlaw state recognition
of gay marriages, should another state ever legalize them.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie McBride, a leading opponent of Proposition 22, exhorted
the audience to do everything in its power to fight what she called
``an insurance policy for bigotry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us honor this celebration by mobilizing ourselves as
lovers, gay and straight,'' McBride said.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing, Feb. 1-3, will draw experts on Methodist scripture,
traditions and ethics from around the country, according to the
Rev. Ron Swisher of Taylor Memorial United Methodist Church of
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Lay people and clergy from both sides of the issue will testify.
The 68 clergy have filed statements with the committee explaining
their actions as acts of conscience required by their Christian
beliefs, and some may also be called to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Swisher, chair of the Committee on Investigation, said the
hearing was highly unusual because of the number of pastors
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Once they've heard all the evidence, the seven clergy members on
the committee will vote on whether the pastors should undergo a
church trial. Punishment could include losing their ordination.
</P>
<P>
   A similar trial in Omaha cost Methodist Pastor Jimmy Creech his
calling, for violating a rule outlawing the blessing of same-sex
couples that the Methodist Church passed in 1998. Until then, it
was up to each minister.
</P>
<P>
   But Creech's trial took place in a different conference which,
unlike the California-Nevada one, did not support equal treatment
of homosexuals.

   Hurricanes are defined by wind speed _ 74 miles per hour or
higher _ but when the storms strike, it is often their heavy,
persistent rain that does the most damage. Such was the case for
Hurricane Mitch in October 1998 in Central America and to a lesser
but still impressive degree for Hurricane Floyd during September in
the eastern United States.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration are refining new methods to chart how much rain is
falling in a major tropical storm. The methods rely on satellites
set up to measure various types of energy reflected by storm
clouds: microwave, infrared or visible light. Since 1978, the
researchers have collected satellite data, largely over the United
States, that allow them to relate these energy levels to the
amounts of rain measured below the clouds by rain gauges and radar.
They say that the satellite estimates fall within 25 percent to 50
percent of the rain gauge results.
</P>
<P>
   Even with such a large margin of error, the satellite estimates
are better than nothing in areas without rain gauges, like remote
mountainous regions where some of the heaviest rain occurs and
where floods originate.
</P>
<P>
   The information can be made available within minutes after
collection and can therefore be used to provide warnings of flash
floods and to assist in relief efforts.

&HT;     OLYMPIC FAME HAS FADED, BUT LAKE PLACID REMAINS A WINTER
HAVEN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TIM REYNOLDS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. _ The streets have not bustled with this much
anticipation in 20 years, the natives of this tiny Essex County
village will tell you. Banners and signs that welcome the world are
as omnipresent on Main Street as the icicles that hang off
rooftops.
</P>
<P>
   As you stroll down the narrow, curvy main artery of Lake Placid,
a village with some 2,500 residents, you can't help but wonder how
similar it is today to the Olympic years of 1932 and 1980, when the
eyes of the world's winter sports enthusiasts were focused here.
</P>
<P>
   Those eyes have wandered past Lake Placid in recent years, its
luster usurped by places such as Calgary, Nagano, and Salt Lake
City. In the 1990s, international competitions always seemed to be
headed elsewhere, leaving youth hockey tournaments to fill the void
in Lake Placid.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, the down period that followed the 1980 Olympics
appears to be ending. Lake Placid is part of history, but it isn't
history. Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an evolution,'' said Ted Blazer, president and chief
executive officer of the Olympic Regional Development Authority.
``But I don't know if I would call it a resurgence.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, the inaugural Winter Goodwill Games begin here, the
biggest on a list of big events that have marked Lake Placid's
reemergence on the international winter sports scene. First there
was the U.S. Ski Team Gold Cup two years ago, then an Ironman
triathlon and a World Cup biathlon event last year. Future events
include the inaugural Winter National Senior Games Feb. 29-March 3,
the ESPN Great Outdoor Games this summer, and the bobsledding world
championships in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``Selfishly, I think we're still the winter sports capital of
the world,'' said the village's mayor, T. James Strack, himself a
former competitive bobsledder. ``If you come here, see the ski
jumps and Whiteface Mountain and the new bobsled run, how could you
not say that? We can handle anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Lake Placid first achieved notoriety as a vacation spot for the
rich and elite, and soon after as a winter sports wonderland, a
distinction it has held for seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   But not even the surrounding 46 mountains in upstate New York,
the mammoth earthy mounds that compose the High Peaks of the
Adirondacks, could protect Lake Placid from ebbs and flows of
success along the way. It is a two-time Olympic Winter Games host,
one of only three places in the world with that distinction, but
the residual benefits of being an Olympic city last only so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last four or five years, maybe longer, there's been a
real effort on the part of elected officials to make people aware
how difficult it is to survive in the Adirondacks economically,''
said James McKenna of the Lake Placid Visitors Bureau. ``Sports
seem to mix with the Adirondacks pretty well, and it was a matter
of figuring out how to use sports as an engine to cultivate more
economic activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, thoughts like those weren't necessary. The
1980 Olympics were the stuff of legend, with Eric Heiden's five
speedskating gold medals and the scintillating run by the
miracle-making U.S. ice hockey team secure in American sports lore.
</P>
<P>
   But those memories alone couldn't keep Lake Placid fresh in
people's minds. Instead of moving forward, Lake Placid was falling
off the winter sports radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of that concern,'' Blazer said, ``came determination and
drive to not let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The venues that separated Lake Placid from the rest of the world
were, in some cases, literally falling apart. Construction of
second homes and condominiums, a trend that exploded in Lake Placid
during the 1980s, essentially ceased in the early 1990s. These were
all bad signs for a village of 3,000 that has an unemployment rate
twice the national average, and where one in five families lives
below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started coming here 10 or 11 years ago, Lake Placid
was a nice little resort town with an Olympic reputation,'' said
Barbara Harubin, a Johnson City resident whose husband, Edward,
runs a summer fishing-tour business in the Lake Placid area, and
whose family vacations in Lake Placid during the winter. ``Then it
seemed like its time had passed, but now it's exciting again.''
</P>
<P>
   Strack disagreed with the notion that Lake Placid's time had
ever passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were never in financial trouble; we were in recognition
trouble,'' said Strack, who pointed to lack of marketing and lack
of facilities upkeep as the two factors that led to the village's
failure to attract major sporting competitions. ``We've got a gold
mine here, and we had to put some money back into it to get the
word out again.''
</P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lake Placid bid unsuccessfully for the 1992 Olympic Winter
Games, the first blow the village took in the winter sports arena.
Once folks realized that another Olympic year is a long way off, if
ever, they started to get creative with marketing strategies.
Blazer pointed to the Gold Cup, which served as the U.S. Olympic
skiing trials in 1998, as the type of event that Lake Placid would
like to land consistently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fulfilled their needs before the Olympic period,'' Blazer
said. ``And it fulfilled ours _ a multisport event which was
televised. So the event was created. And I think there's a lot of
opportunity like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer's Ironman triathlon fit that bill, as do these
upcoming Goodwill Games, which local officials estimate could pump
$12 million into the Lake Placid region.
</P>
<P>
   Blazer, ever the optimist, points to the upcoming events as
proof that Lake Placid's lull is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other place in the world has an edge on Lake Placid now,''
Blazer said.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic sites such as Chamonix, St. Moritz and Squaw Valley fell
off the list of competitive winter sport havens long ago. Venues in
Sarajevo were destroyed by a war, and venues in Albertville were
dismantled almost as soon as the final gold medal was awarded there
eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Here, though, the village clings to its Olympic heritage, a
distinction that separates it from its similar-sized neighbors in
the hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that always kept us going was our Olympic Training
Center, which always kept the athletes coming here,'' Strack said.
``As long as we could keep that thing active and going, there was
always hope that someone would see the beauty of the area and the
facilities we have here.''

CHINA INSTALLS 2-YEAR-OLD TIBETAN AS `LIVING BUDDHA' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The Chinese authorities have presided over the
enthronement of a 2-year-old boy as an important ``living Buddha''
in the Tibetan religion, the official New China News Agency
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But whether most Tibetan people and monks will accept the boy's
authenticity is in question. On Monday in India, the
government-in-exile of the Dalai Lama, the revered spiritual leader
of Tibet, said it would not approve the choice.
</P>
<P>
   In a ceremony on Sunday at the Johkang Temple in Lhasa, Tibet,
Soinam Puncog, 2, was designated the seventh Reting Lama, the
reincarnation of the sixth lama in a politically important line,
who died in 1997. The boy was chosen by monks from the Reting
Monastery after they examined 670 boys and used methods of
divination, according to official accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The selection process and the ceremony were carefully managed by
the Chinese government, which has sought _ with little evidence of
success _ to nurture a new generation of Tibetan Buddhist leaders
loyal to the communist state and not to the Dalai Lama. Chinese
officials consider the Dalai Lama to be a separatist enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding over the ceremony, the press agency reported, was the
mayor of Lhasa, Losang Gyalcan. The vice chairman of the Tibet
Autonomous Region provided the regional government's certificate of
approval, and an official of the national Religious Affairs Bureau
also attended.
</P>
<P>
   China's Tibet strategy appeared to suffer a severe setback
earlier this month when the Karmapa Lama, believed to be the
reincarnation of another important lama, unexpectedly appeared in
Dharmsala, India, the seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile. The
Karmapa Lama, who is 14, arrived there on Jan. 5 after an icy
eight-day trek through the Himalayas.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, the 17th Karmapa Lama, was ordained in 1992 with the
approval of the Beijing authorities and the Dalai Lama. The Chinese
held him up as an example of a ``patriotic'' lama and reportedly
hoped that he would play a major leadership role.
</P>
<P>
   Since his flight, the boy has not spoken out about his
intentions. China has left the door open to his return, asserting
that he left to collect ritual instruments, but exiled leaders said
he was fleeing religious restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Since his departure, at least two monks from his monastery near
Lhasa have been detained for questioning, the Tibet Information
Network in London reported.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 the search for the reincarnation of Tibet's
second-most-important religious leader, the Panchen Lama, became
mired in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   From afar the Dalai Lama announced his own choice, a boy who was
on the government's list of candidates. Angered at being
pre-empted, government officials put that boy under house arrest
and chose another, but his legitimacy has not been widely accepted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Reting Lamas have in the past played roles in searching for
reincarnations of the Dalai Lama and have served as regents in his
absence. The fifth Reting was a key figure in choosing the current
Dalai Lama in the 1930s, but after a power struggle over the
regency, that Reting Lama died in a Lhasa prison in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Raiqen living Buddha is one of the highest-ranking
positions in Tibetan Buddhism,'' the New China News Agency said,
using the Chinese name for Reting. ``The tradition of patriotism
and the spirit to preserve the unity of the Chinese nation have
long been advocated by Raiqen living Buddhas.''

   DIAGNOSIS
</P>
<P>
   A Safer, Simpler Way to Test a Fetus
</P>
<P>
   Pregnant women who show signs that their fetuses may have
anemia, which in serious cases can require treatment even before
the baby is born, have traditionally been advised to undergo
diagnostic procedures that involve physically piercing their wombs.
</P>
<P>
   The tests are effective at confirming the disease but can cause
their own risk to the mother or fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new study suggests that Doppler ultrasound may be a
simpler, safer and less expensive way to diagnose fetal anemia.
Researchers at Yale found that the blood in anemic infants moves
faster through cerebral arteries and veins than it does in healthy
infants and that the increased speeds can be detected using a
technique similar to that used by expectant mothers to determine
the health of their babies. The study was published in a recent
issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors suspect a fetus has anemia when they see irregularities
in the mother's blood. The disease, which causes an oxygen
deficiency in the baby's blood, occurs when the father and mother
have different blood types and the father's red blood antigens are
transferred to the fetus. An allergic reaction can then occur that
can kill the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   The condition occurs in about 14,000 women a year in the United
States; about 1,400 of their fetuses need transfusions.
</P>
<P>
   The current practice is to have women with signs of fetal anemia
undergo either an amniocentesis, the procedure now commonly used
for older women or those with signs of a fetal genetic disorder, or
cordocentesis, in which the umbilical cord is pierced.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do those procedures carry risk to the mother and fetus
but in most cases, they turned out to be unwarranted, said Dr.
Giancarlo Mari, the study's lead author.
</P>
<P>
   Ultrasound takes three to five minutes and poses no risks to
mother or child.
</P>
<P>
   HABITS
</P>
<P>
   For Thumb-Sucking, a Gentle Pull
</P>
<P>
   Pleading doesn't usually work. Nor do threats of dire, if
cosmetic, consequences. Even a good dollop of something yucky
doesn't seem to do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   But could a simple elastic bandage be the cure for nighttime
thumb- and digit-sucking in children? An article in a recent issue
of Pediatric Dentistry says that may well be the case.
</P>
<P>
   The author, Dr. Steven M. Adair, a professor of pediatric
dentistry at the Medical College of Georgia, says the technique has
a success rate of 60 percent. It involves wrapping an elastic
bandage from the mid-forearm to about halfway up the bicep, with
much of the bandage around the elbow, making it more difficult for
the arm to remain bent.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to create a constant, gentle tension that allows the
child to place a digit in his mouth but pulls it out when the arms
relaxes.
</P>
<P>
   Dentists and parents have long tried a variety of methods to
stop digit sucking, from swabbing fingers with unsavory substances
to retainer-like devices that prevent fingers from entering the
mouth. Most children outgrow thumb-sucking, but if it persists it
can cause embarrassment and dental problems.
</P>
<P>
   The bandage technique, Adair said, is not new, but does not
appear to be widespread. It is not, however, for everybody. The
child must express an interest in stopping, and the effort should
not be made when the child is going through a trauma like entering
a new school.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   BEHAVIOR
</P>
<P>
   Trouble for Women in the Mess Hall
</P>
<P>
   A recent study of women on active duty in the Army found that
some 8 percent had eating disorders like bulimia or anorexia.
</P>
<P>
   That's not as high as the rate some studies have found among
female athletes, but higher than that found among women in general,
where the rate is about 1 percent to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The study was published in the journal Medicine and Science in
Sports and Exercise and was conducted by a captain serving at the
Madigan Army Medical Center in Tacoma, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The researcher, Dr. Tamara D. Lauder, is now working at the Mayo
Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lauder and her colleagues studied 423 enlisted women and
officers at Fort Lewis, in Washington, over a one-year period.
</P>
<P>
   She first handed out questionnaires to screen for women who
might have eating disorders, and then did follow-up interviews with
the 142 who appeared to be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, 33 were found to have diagnosable eating disorders.
Many of the women questioned admitted to practices like bingeing,
purging and taking laxatives to keep their weight down _ all of
which can have detrimental effects on health, despite the grueling
daily physical requirements of military life.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers suggested several possible factors for the high
incidence of the disorders. Chief among them were the high pressure
on women in a male environment to pass physical tests and the need
to meet weight requirements that are checked every six months.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lauder said the military should rethink its weight
requirements. ``I think maybe they have to look at whether the
standards are appropriate for all body types across the board and
for all duty roles,'' she said. ``Perhaps the standards should be
more varied.''
</P>
<P>
   PATTERNS
</P>
<P>
   In Hot Pursuit of Lou Gehrig's Killer
</P>
<P>
   A common virus related to those that cause meningitis and polio
may play a role in the debilitating illness commonly known as Lou
Gehrig's disease.
</P>
<P>
   While scientists have long suspected that the enterovirus may
play a role in the development of the disease, the new study
appears to provide the strongest evidence to date to support this
case.
</P>
<P>
   Formally known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the disease
gradually paralyzes its victims before taking their lives. The
report, prepared by a team of researchers at the University of
California at Irvine and researchers in France, was published in
the current issue of the journal Neurology.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say they have not established whether the virus
causes or has any impact on the disease, which became known as Lou
Gehrig's disease after striking the New York Yankees star.
</P>
<P>
   Previous experiments into the presence of the virus were
inconclusive or conflicting. But researchers in the latest study
made use of newer, highly sensitive tests that detected the
presence of the virus from just a few scraps of the genetic
material RNA.
</P>
<P>
   When scientists studied spinal cord samples from 17 victims of
the disease, they found evidence of the enterovirus in the motor
nerve cells of 15. The virus was found in only one of 29 people
studied who had died of other causes.
</P>
<P>
   But the authors said many questions remained, among them whether
the enterovirus scraps bring about neuron death or simply represent
an irrelevant, associated phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   An editorial accompanying the study said that, if confirmed, the
findings could be useful for treating the disease.
</P>
<P>
   THERAPIES
</P>
<P>
   When a Hug Helps Relieve the Pain
</P>
<P>
   Few mothers need persuading when it comes to hugging their
newborns, but a new study suggests that encouraging them to do so
can help reduce babies' pain during a standard medical test.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after birth, tests are done on blood drawn from a baby's
heel after it is pierced with a lance. A new study on the Web site
of the journal Pediatrics reported that the pain could be reduced
if the baby experienced a skin-to-skin hug with the mother during
the lancing.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Larry Gray, a Boston University pediatrician, and colleagues
videotaped 30 babies and measured their heart rates, as the blood
was drawn. Those being hugged cried and grimaced less and had a
smaller heart rate increase than their counterparts.

   Q: If you took all the DNA in human chromosomes, unraveled the
double strands and strung them end to end, how far would it reach?
</P>
<P>
   A: The standard answer given by geneticists is approximately 6
feet.
</P>
<P>
   However, that is just the length of the tightly coiled genetic
code that would appear in a single human cell containing the
standard-issue 23 pairs of chromosomes, and there are trillions of
cells in the human body.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA code contains 3 billion ``letters,'' and hundreds of
scientists have been working long days for a decade and a half to
spell out the genes encoded by the letters, the goal of the famous
Human Genome Project. There are only four letters in the code's
alphabet, designated C, G, A and T, which stand for four nucleic
acids: guanine, cytosine, adenine and thymine.
</P>
<P>
   In the ladderlike structure of DNA, each letter forms a
``step,'' or pair, linking only with its designated partner, C with
G and A with T, and these so-called base pairs repeat in sequences
that carry information, in stretches called exons, and spacers, in
stretches called introns.
</P>
<P>
   Within the DNA sequence of a chromosome are the genes (probably
100,000 or more in the human genome), each of which carries
instructions for a cell to make a specific protein that the body
needs.

`TITUS' DIRECTOR CHALLENGES HERSELF AND MOVIEGOERS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think of it as ``King Lear'' on crack. A snuff film in iambic
pentameter. ``Spartacus'' meets Visconti's ``The Damned'' by way of
``Xena, Warrior Princess'' _ minus the pneumatic close-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead: Pick your own glib pop-culture analogy. Julie Taymor
knows it's all part of the Hollywood promotional game when you're
pushing a story as dark and difficult as Shakespeare's ``Titus
Andronicus.''
</P>
<P>
   Most movie critics were complimentary when ``Titus,'' Taymor's
film treatment of Shakespeare's bleak revenge tragedy, opened
Christmas Day in New York and Los Angeles to qualify for the
Oscars. They praised Taymor's conceptual daring in matching
Shakespeare's 400-year-old text to modern, special-effects-laden
imagery, and heaped praise on the movie's stars, Anthony Hopkins,
Jessica Lange and Alan Cumming.
</P>
<P>
   Cast members say even they were astonished at how Taymor, a 1991
recipient of a MacArthur ``genius'' Fellowship with but two short
films under her belt, took charge of ``Titus''' every detail with
complete assurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knew exactly what she wanted,'' says Lange. ``And visually
she's extremely creative.''
</P>
<P>
   But the real test, both for Taymor and ``Titus,'' comes Friday
when the film moves into nationwide distribution. Although
``Titus'' is riding one of Hollywood's periodic bouts of
infatuation with all things Elizabethan, that's no guarantee
``Shakespeare in Love'' fans will go ga-ga over the Bard's most
bitterly concentrated meditation on hate and its aftershocks.
</P>
<P>
   And while ``Titus''' bottom-line message is
unmistakablyanti-violence, you might not surmise that from the
surfeit of severed body parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Titus' is not an easy play to direct _ period _ and the
dangers and pitfalls are going toward total grand guignol,'' Taymor
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You read it in the press where people say, `It's his
(Shakespeare's) bloodiest this, and body counts and all,' which is
really missing the point, in a way. This story, I think, is
extremely poetic and moving !ital!about!ital! violence. It's not
that it's just a violent movie, which I don't think it is
particularly, not compared to `Braveheart' and `The Matrix' and
`Pulp Fiction.'''
</P>
<P>
   Point taken. But that still doesn't explain what Disney's
favorite avant-garde director _ the woman who brought ``The Lion
King'' to Broadway _ is doing spearheading one of the season's
least family- friendly entertainments.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the biggest challenge for some of Taymor's viewers may
be deciding which principal character churns their stomach the
least: Hopkins' brutally efficient Roman general Titus; Lange's
vengeful Goth queen Tamora; Cumming's smarmy Roman emperor
Saturninus; Harry Lennix's chillingly merciless soldier of fortune
Aaron the Moor.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Disney tapped her for ``The Lion King,'' Taymor was
an esteemed but decidedly outre director-designer of theater and
opera, known for her extravagantly imaginative productions of Carlo
Gozzi's ``The Green Bird,'' Wagner's ``The Flying Dutchman'' and
``Juan Darien _ A Carnival Mass,'' which she co-wrote with her
significant other and frequent collaborator, film composer Elliot
Goldenthal.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until ``The Lion King'' opened on Broadway in November
1997, that Taymor's celebrity began catching up with her unusual
talents. The big-budget musical, which is due to reach Los Angeles
in September, became a huge hit in New York and later in London. It
netted Taymor two Tony Awards, one for direction of a musical, the
other for costumedesign, and elevated her profile beyond the
non-profit theater world overnight.
</P>
<P>
   What made Taymor decide to tackle such a difficult, high-risk
project as ``Titus'' just when she'd broken into the commercial
mainstream?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do a very serious, important work, with the
greatest writer in the English language and the best actors,'' she
explains. ``And I could attract people like Tony and Jessica and
Alan and Harry with this material. And I think people who came
wanted to take the risk and really believed in this material and
are very excited about it. Because they didn't get paid well.
Nobody got paid well.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, paybacks have a way of taking bizarre turns, as the
characters in ``Titus'' learn to their dismay.
</P>
<P>
   Titus, Shakespeare's doomed protagonist (``hero'' doesn't quite
fit), is a by-the-book military man whose ritual sacrifice of a
Goth prisoner starts a domino chain of bloody retribution. By the
time the curtain falls, most of the major players have been maimed,
raped, murdered, cannibalized or several of the above.
</P>
<P>
   Even some cast members, though they liked the play's
over-the-top quality, were caught offguard by its inordinate
bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first read it, I thought, `What a great yarn,''' says
Cumming, the Scottish actor who won a Tony Award for his
performance as the emcee in the recent ``Cabaret'' revival.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when I saw it, I thought, `Jesus, I can't believe this is
a Shakespeare play.' It's like a sort of snuff film. Too much. And
I loved that. But the film sort of confounds people's expectations,
and the play confounds your expectations of Shakespeare.''
</P>
<P>
   Other actors, such as Lange, thought Shakespeare's script had
some ``big holes in it, to tell you the truth,'' but took to the
story anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know the play at all, I'm sorry to admit,'' Lange
says. ``But the script was sent to me, I read the script, then I
read the play. I was kind of amazed. I thought it was really out
there. I liked it right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Modeled after the so-called ``revenge dramas'' of the ancient
Roman scribe Seneca, ``Titus Andronicus'' was written around 1594
as a warm-up to the great Shakespearean tragedies that began six or
seven years later with ``Julius Caesar.''
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, ``Titus'' has suffered by comparison with
sacrosanct masterpieces like ``Hamlet'' and ``Macbeth.'' Polite
Victorians blanched at its operatic excesses.
</P>
<P>
   It took Peter Brooks' landmark 1955 production at
Stratford-upon-Avon, with Laurence Olivier, to redeem the play's
reputation. Yet even today it's rarely performed by the leading
British and North American Shakespeare companies.
</P>
<P>
   Taymor, however, thinks that what made ``Titus'' seem ``crude''
and ``unrefined'' to previous generations _ ``that sort of direct,
youthful, angry, nasty, visceral Shakespeare'' _ is exactly what
makes it speak to modern audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare was (writing) for the masses in the Elizabethan
era, and that's much closer to our time now,'' Taymor says. ``You
know, they'd walk down the street and they'd see an execution,
public execution. That was entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from the amoral horror story it's been typecast as, Taymor
considers ``Titus'' to be a bitterly humorous, deeply ethical play
that raises troubling questions about why societies condemn some
forms of violence, but permit or even champion others.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Shakespeare's done is something that is so complex and
disturbing because he explores all the various kinds of violence on
every single level _ from war and that kind of heroic, courageous,
condoned violence to nihilistic violence, to infanticide, to lust,
rape _ and he puts it all on one level. And he says, `If you
justify one, then the result, the cycle of vengeance will just keep
spiraling and spiraling.'''
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize ``Titus''' timelessness and universality, Taymor
decided to shoot much of the film in Rome, where Imperial Roman
grandeur and Mussolini-esque pomposity can be viewed side by side,
where ancient ruins jostle pointedly with monumental fascist
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Other location shooting was done in war-torn Kosovo, enhancing
the film's sense of taking place in a time warp of human tragedy,
extending from the pre-Christian era to the present.
</P>
<P>
   To further that effect, Taymor and her design team blended
costumes, military weaponry, musical motifs and architectural
styles from different historical epochs. They also interspersed the
movie with surrealistic montages, providing a layer of
psychological commentary not found in Shakespeare's original play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like that mixture,'' Taymor explains. ``I love to take
something, magical-realist, whatever you want to call it. I love to
open it up and show you different ways of seeing the mundane and
the regular, and that's what art is supposed to do anyway: to put a
different mirror on your life, so you re-examine everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Cast members say that Taymor's creative intensity helped color
the entire film-making experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a fiery set, I'll tell you,'' Cumming says.
``We all got on great, but you know the play is kind of fiery. And
being in Italy is fiery. And making a film in Rome is fiery-fiery!
You know, everyone shouts all the time, and so the whole atmosphere
was kind of hysterical, which was, in retrospect, great for the
movie, but at the time it was like, `Please stop shouting! Don't
give me any more espresso!'''
</P>
<P>
   Taymor hopes that with Fox Searchlight's backing, ``Titus'' may
find an audience beyond the typical ``Shakespeare lover,
sophisticated art-house crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had some inner-city high school kids in New York see it
and they said, `Move over, Schwarzenegger,''' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Ah-nold could reprise his Conan the Barbarian persona to
star in Taymor's next project, an opera based on the novel
``Grendel,'' John Gardiner's 1971 reimagining of the medieval epic
poem ``Beowulf'' told from the monster's point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Taymor laughs at her penchant for seeking the present in the
long-ago and far away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to have different ways of telling the old story,'' she
says.

 &HT;    Gore promises funding to help restore MLK's church
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Standing at the very pulpit and in the footsteps of
Martin Luther King Jr., Vice President Al Gore announced Monday
that money would soon pour in to restore Ebenezer Baptist Church to
its original glory.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, speaking at Monday's Martin Luther King, Jr. Annual
Commemorative Service, announced that $500,000 from two private
donors will be added to $500,000 already set aside by the federal
government to restore the historic sanctuary at Ebenezer, where
King, his grandfather, father and brother preached.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also announced that the Clinton administration will ask
Congress for $1.5 million in the 2001 budget to help protect King's
birthplace on Atlanta's Auburn Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``His home is literally the cradle of America's Civil Rights
Movement,'' said Gore. ``This pulpit, this simple place, with
wooden steps, is sacred ground. We must preserve this place and
preserve the spirit of this place for future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was a special guest at Monday's ecumenical service. He was
joined by a host of dignitaries, including Rep. John Lewis, Mayor
Bill Campbell, Gov. Roy Barnes, Bishop Eddie Long of New Birth
Missionary Baptist Church, Sen. Paul Coverdell, and New Jersey
State Secretary DeForest B. Soaries, Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout most of the morning, the rafters of the creaky, old
church shook as speakers took turns praising King. None more
prominently than King's youngest daughter, the Rev. Bernice
Albertine King, the only one to follow him to the pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding over the ceremony with her aunt, Christine King
Farris, Bernice King brought the congregation to its feet at least
a half dozen times, harkening memories of her father.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we move into the 21st century, it's going to be incumbent
upon all of us to realize that while Martin Luther King Jr. was a
great and awesome man, that we too have a calling and assignment in
this life,'' Bernice King said. ``Today, God is calling upon all of
us to look at ourselves and ask the question, `What is it that I am
to do to further the cause of freedom, justice and equality?'''
</P>
<P>
   But her most stirring comments came in defense of her mother,
Coretta Scott King, who has often been criticized for her role in
how King's image is being handled and marketed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is not worthy of the criticism she has received, and
unless you have cried like she has, had to raise four children
without a husband, with little or no money, then you don't know,''
said Bernice King. ``So I say to my brothers and sisters: 'leave my
mama alone.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. King joked that she could take care of herself, then
reminded the audience that under the Clinton-Gore administration,
blacks have seen many political, social and economic gains. Gore
countered that still not enough has been done and told the audience
not to be satisfied with the successes achieved by King during the
civil rights campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, 32 years after we lost him, America still needs the
soaring dream of Martin Luther King Jr.,'' Gore said. ``Martin,
where are you? We need your prophetic voice, and we hear it now
even from the grave.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore added that King would not be fully satisfied with where the
country is right now, despite the gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Dr. King were with us, he would celebrate our gains, but he
would then turn us to the hard work that is still undone,'' Gore
said. ``Dr. King reminds us that that truth is marching on. There
is no such thing as partial freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said freedom will come when everyone has health coverage,
teachers are respected and black and Hispanic men aren't stopped on
the highway by police simply because they are black and Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all the progress we have made, we still have to renew and
build that beloved community that Dr. King spoke about,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore later joined Mrs. King, Bernice King and Dexter Scott King
in placing two wreaths in front of King's grave.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the most moving and best celebration we have ever
had,'' said Dexter King, chairman of King Center. ``I think we are
kicking this century in good.''

BERLIN MAYOR TO SKIP DEDICATION OF HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL, ANGERING
MANY 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Eberhard Diepgen, the mayor of Berlin, has decided not
to attend the dedication ceremony next week for a large Holocaust
memorial near the Brandenburg Gate, a project he has long opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Diepgen has said his agenda was too full to attend the ceremony
on Jan. 27, although he has declined to specify what his other
engagements are.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Naumann, Germany's senior cultural official, said:
``This is a significant ceremony demonstrating the fact that the
memorial will be built. I am very surprised that Diepgen is not
coming and hope he will change his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony, to be attended by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder,
President Johannes Rau and Elie Wiesel, is intended to put to rest
a decade of tumultuous debate over a memorial that will combine a
field of more than 2,000 stone pillars and a ``documentation
center'' whose exact form and character remain murky.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has revealed deep differences over the place of
memory in a society now two generations removed from the Nazi era,
and over the image of the new city being built on land once
occupied by the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Diepgen has argued that the memorial is too big and impossible
to protect. Officials close to him have suggested that it may be
unnecessary in a city that already has several smaller monuments
commemorating the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   By its position and size, the memorial, by the New York
architect Peter Eisenman, will be a dominant feature of the city.
It is to be built at a time when many Germans feel that the country
has done enough to commemorate, confront and pay compensation for
the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Michael-Andreas Butz, the spokesman for the mayor, did not
return several telephone calls seeking comment. In statements to
the German press, he has said the mayor is far too busy, may not
have been invited, and will in any event be represented by another
senior Christian Democratic politician.
</P>
<P>
   Naumann said he was sure that the mayor had been invited and
that his absence from the ceremony would be unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
   American officials, already in a conflict with Diepgen over
security for a new American Embassy in Berlin, expressed irritation
at the mayor's decision. John Kornblum, the American ambassador, is
to attend the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang Thierse, the speaker of Parliament, has described the
ceremony as the ``symbolic start of the memorial's construction.''
But building at the vast site is not expected to begin until next
year at the earliest because financing and some architectural
details have not been completed.
</P>
<P>
   It also emerged late last year that a small corner of the site
was still owned by a municipal housing company, and the status of
that piece of land has to be resolved. Because discussion over it
will involve the city government, and because Diepgen is not
enthusiastic, the talks could take some time.
</P>
<P>
   The city will also be largely responsible for construction of
the project. It remains unclear when the memorial, whose cost is
estimated at $26 million, will be completed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because of those remaining difficulties with a project approved
last year by Parliament, officials have decided to refrain from a
groundbreaking ceremony. Rather, large signs in German and English
will be unveiled at the dedication showing what the memorial will
be and explaining its significance.
</P>
<P>
   As other buildings around the 4.9-acre empty lot have moved
toward completion in the last year, this large hole in the heart of
Berlin has become increasingly conspicuous, prompting occasional
exasperated suggestions that the best memorial would be simply to
leave the site vacant.
</P>
<P>
   Delays have also emerged at the city's new Jewish Museum, which
was to have opened later this year. Problems with the
air-conditioning system and other technical features of the
building by Daniel Libeskind, an American architect, have pushed
the opening back to 2001.

TIMID KILLER ASTEROIDS  
 RE-INVENTING RICE  
 THE TINIEST ICE CUBE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Hooray for Hollywood. All those recent movies about killer
asteroids seem to have scared half of them away. (Think about it:
would you want Bruce Willis and a gang of crazed wildcatters coming
after you?)
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Hollywood cannot take any credit here. What has
happened is that a team of researchers, using improved detection
techniques, has determined that the number of near-Earth asteroids
capable of causing catastrophe is about half that of previous
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, from Yale and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
used an automated tracking program in conjunction with a telescope
in Hawaii to search systematically for potential Earth-killers,
which have diameters from about half a mile to six miles.
</P>
<P>
   After searching part of the sky for two years, they used
computer simulations to come up with a total estimate, which, they
report in the journal Nature, is about 700. Previous estimates were
1,000 to 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Earth, the smaller number does not
substantially change the risk factor, which though very small is
real (to paraphrase a popular bumper sticker, just one killer
asteroid can ruin your whole day). But the researchers note that
with the smaller estimate, and with improved detection techniques,
90 percent of these asteroids should be located within two decades,
giving scientists and policy makers a better idea of what, if
anything, to do about them. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

<P>
   Vitamin A deficiency is a serious problem in developing
countries, affecting at least 125 million children worldwide and
causing, among other things, partial or complete blindness. It is a
particular problem in cultures where rice is a staple food, as
milled rice contains none of the vitamin.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers in Switzerland and Germany may have come up with a
solution. As reported in the journal Science, they have genetically
engineered rice to produce beta-carotene in the endosperm _ the
starchy, edible portion of the grain. (Beta-carotene is converted
by the body into vitamin A.)
</P>
<P>
   The work required inserting three genes from different sources
into the rice plant, in effect introducing the entire pathway by
which beta-carotene is produced. Most efforts at genetically
engineering plants have involved only one gene.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting rice grains are a golden yellow color and should,
the researchers suggest, provide a significant amount of the
vitamin. The goal is to establish breeding lines of the engineered
rice and make it available to farmers in developing countries. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It might not put much of a chill on your mai tai, but scientists
at the University of North Carolina have created the world's
tiniest ice cube.
</P>
<P>
   The cube, really more of a hexagon, consists of just six
molecules of water in a flat ring, which is the way ice occurs in
nature. Since even a tiny chip of ice contains many billions of
these rings, the research will allow scientists to study the
hydrogen bonding that occurs when water freezes without being
encumbered by all those other molecules.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier attempts to create a single ice ring had failed, with
the molecules' collapsing into a denser, cagelike structure that is
not like real ice. (In nature, ice does not have this problem
because it has a three-dimensional structure that keeps the
molecules in the proper position.)
</P>
<P>
   The Carolina researchers used liquid helium to grow the ice
rings at a very low temperature. Low temperature means low energy,
so the molecules did not have the energy to rearrange themselves
into the cage-like shape.
</P>
<P>
   The research should eventually help scientists understand more
about basic molecular interactions that will help with the design
of pharmaceuticals and other compounds. To that end, the next step
for the Carolina researchers will be to introduce other small
molecules to see how the water molecules interact with them.

THE MAN WHO STOPPED TIME AND OPENED WORLDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Neb., Mass.)   (Science Times)  
(af) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Harold E. Edgerton was a wizard of invention who changed the
way people see things. The flash of his camera opened up hidden
worlds of motion: of golf clubs flattening apparently rigid balls,
of drops of milk forming crowns of splattered droplets, of beetles
firing seemingly fluid secretions in what turned out to be rapid
pulses. His photographs revealed the drama hidden in the
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   A born showman, Edgerton communicated his love of science and
discovery to students and peers at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, where he worked and taught for more than six decades.
</P>
<P>
   The luckiest worked with ``Doc'' Edgerton in Strobe Alley, the
campus laboratory where he and his cohorts invented the machines
that illuminated unseen worlds.
</P>
<P>
   A Nebraska native, Edgerton died in January 1990 at 86. But his
work lives on, and this month, MIT Press released a multimedia
CD-ROM, ``Exploring the Art and Science of Stopping Time: The Life
and Work of Harold E. Edgerton.'' The CD ($37.95) runs on Macintosh
or Windows, contains hundreds of Edgerton's photos, explains how
they were made and recounts the inventor's life, often in his own
voice. Made for middle and high school students, and curious
adults, the CD also lets scholars simulate some of Edgerton's
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   His main tool was the stroboscope, which he perfected in 1931.
Like the electronic flash on a camera, the stroboscope fired a
brilliant light. But its flash tube did so repeatedly and quickly
in a series of bursts of very short duration, allowing an
accompanying camera or human eye to capture very fast motions.
</P>
<P>
   Edgerton trained his new tool on a wide range of subjects.
Perhaps the most famous early use of the stroboscope was in a
lawsuit between Lever Brothers and Procter &AMP; Gamble on rival
methods of making soap powder, the CD-ROM recounts. Stroboscopic
movies provided visual proof that while the two methods looked
alike, under the surface they were different. The suit was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1930s, he had embarked on his lifelong effort to
unveil the everyday: tennis players hitting serves, water running
from a faucet, and all sorts of creatures in flight. In 1940, his
flash caught Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney in mid-song, and a
10-minute movie of his, ``Quicker Than a Wink,'' won an Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, his strobes were used for aerial
reconnaissance, and after the war, he helped photograph and analyze
the blinding flash of atom bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Later in life, he published many articles and photographs in
National Geographic, including ones revealing the delicate wing
movements of hummingbirds. Some of Edgerton's most enthusiastic
work focused on undersea archaeology, marine life and treasure
hunting, where his innovative lights and cameras often illuminated
inky realms of pitch blackness. It was his camera system that first
illuminated the Titanic's ghostly hulk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man was a lot of fun,'' recalled Emory Kristof, a National
Geographic photographer who accompanied Edgerton on a 1976
expedition to hunt for the Loch Ness monster. ``He would play the
guitar and stay up all night long.''
</P>
<P>
   The main CD-ROM screen shows three doors that lead to three
aspects of Edgerton's life. The Biography door tells his story in
text and films, including those of Air Force reconnaissance and
undersea photography. The Lab door, labeled ``Strobe Alley,'' lets
explorers do experiments on flowing water, bursting balloons and
bouncing balls. The Work Archive door leads to a photographic
exhibit of Edgerton's work.
</P>
<P>
   James Sheldon, a photographer who produced the CD-ROM and runs
the new media program at Emerson College, Boston, said Edgerton
resonated especially deeply with children, making a tour of his
life for students quite fitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an amazing knack to get you to open your eyes and
explore,'' Sheldon said. ``He did that with kids on a constant
basis.''

 &HT;    UPS sees bright future in financial services unit
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ United Parcel Service, which has stretched its
strategic horizons beyond basic delivery service in recent years,
is dipping a Big Brown toe into financial services.
</P>
<P>
   UPS is extending loans to customers and offering advance
payments on certain transactions and accounts receivables. It's
even leasing office and warehouse equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Why would the shipping giant bother with such transactions?
</P>
<P>
   ``Cash flow is the lifeblood of any business,'' said Bob
Bernabucci, president of UPS Capital, the subsidiary managing the
raft of new financial products. By helping shippers solve cash-flow
problems, UPS helps them grow into bigger shippers.
</P>
<P>
   The move also fits with UPS' broader strategy of embedding
itself in the business processes of shipping customers _ making it
harder for them to bolt to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Worldwide Logistics subsidiary, for instance,
provides an array of supply-chain management services and is UPS'
fastest-growing unit.
</P>
<P>
   Other UPS subsidiaries sell software to facilitate e-commerce,
which accounts for a growing chunk of the delivery business.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching financial products is the next step in that strategy,
Bernabucci said. The move, which began with UPS Capital's 1998
formation, reflects the change in corporate thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had talked about this five years ago, it would have been
dismissed as a wild idea,'' said Bernabucci, a veteran of UPS'
finance division.
</P>
<P>
   Financing can be a lucrative sidelight for cash-rich
corporations like UPS, which had $27 billion in revenue last year
and pulled off a $5.5 billion initial public offering. A prime
example is General Electric's huge GE Capital Services unit.
</P>
<P>
   UPS Capital is still relatively tiny, with just 62 employees.
Bernabucci said that number could double this year, and a marketing
campaign ramps up this winter.
</P>
<P>
   The unit offers to credit the accounts of cash-on-delivery
shippers within two days of delivery. Normally the process can take
a week or more, tying up precious cash.
</P>
<P>
   Computer giant Gateway is already using the service, but it's
also aimed at making COD shipments more workable for Internet
mom-and-pops whose customers are reluctant to pay for goods in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   UPS Capital also is making advance payments on accounts
receivables, targeting smaller companies that grapple with payment
delays.
</P>
<P>
   The office equipment leasing service provides everything from
copiers and computers to warehouse machinery. UPS doesn't own the
items but will finance leases.
</P>
<P>
   Bernabucci said the unit's goal is not simply to fuel shipping
growth for UPS' core business but to turn a profit in its own
right.

GERMAN DRUG MAKER SEES PROFIT POTENTIAL IN JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In another sign of deregulation's ability to pry open
the Japanese economy and breath new life into businesses here,
Boehringer Ingelheim, a large German pharmaceuticals company,
started a tender offer Monday for shares of SS Pharmaceuticals Co.,
a Japanese drug maker.
</P>
<P>
   Boehringer, which has had a 19.6 percent stake in SS
Pharmaceuticals since 1996, is seeking to capitalize on the
increasing deregulation of the over-the-counter drug market. Its
goal is to attain at least a 33.4 percent stake in the company,
which would give it a seat on the board and a limited ability to
veto decisions, including the ability to thwart other potential
suitors.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the Japanese pharmaceuticals industry has largely sat
out the consolidation that is affecting its counterparts overseas,
deterred by heavy regulation and onerous drug-approval procedures.
</P>
<P>
   But the government is slowly releasing its grip on some parts of
the industry, choosing last April to allow the sale of some
over-the-counter pharmaceuticals in convenience stores. Those
products _ including throat lozenges, antacids, antiseptic creams
and sprays, and vitamins C and E, as well as calcium _ had
previously been available only in pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deregulation of the industry makes Japan an attractive place
for any pharmaceutical company operating on a global basis,'' said
Rolf Krebs, vice chairman of Boehringer.
</P>
<P>
   Boehringer is offering to buy SS Pharmaceutical shares at 1,100
yen apiece, or about $10.44 at current exchange rates, a 41 percent
premium to the closing price on Friday. It will pay a 13.2 percent
premium to buy the company's convertible bonds.
</P>
<P>
   It values SS Pharmaceuticals at 134.6 billion yen, or roughly
$1.28 billion.
</P>
<P>
   SS Pharmaceuticals, which manufactures over-the-counter and
prescription drugs as well as various types of vitamin supplements
and tonics, has a vast distribution network and its own chain of
stores. The company said it learned last week of Boehringer's
interest in increasing its stake.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese company has been particularly successful at
exploiting new distribution channels in the wake of the recent
deregulation. It announced last fall that it expected its profits
for the fiscal year that ends March 31 to more than double on the
strength of sales of metabolic stimulants, or so-called energy
drinks, through convenience stores.
</P>
<P>
   The drinks, which often contain Chinese herbs, snake oil and
other homeopathic types of ingredients, are wildly popular here
despite their often high cost. Their effects are rather like those
of appetite suppressants.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also had great success in repackaging a
27-year-old hangover cure, Hi-Tiol C, as a means of lightening
freckles and other spots on the skin. Sales before the makeover
were about 2 billion yen a year, or about $19 million, but have
risen to over 6 billion yen. ``There is an increase in women
users,'' Yukinobu Kubota, a spokesman for SS Pharmaceuticals, said.
</P>
<P>
   Boehringer has been selling various over-the-counter drugs in
Japan through SS Pharmaceuticals, which is in the midst of seeking
approval for a drug developed by Boehringer to fight chronic
bronchitis.

 c.2000 American Heritage  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   My father, Nikita Khrushchev, always favored direct dialogue,
without intermediaries, and in Vienna, in June 1961 he and
President John F. Kennedy _ at what would turn out to be their only
face-to-face meeting _ agreed to establish a direct White
House-to-Kremlin link by means of special couriers. Kennedy
proposed exchanging confidential letters outside of official State
Department channels; my father readily agreed.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pact that would serve the parties well during the Cuban
missile crisis, which broke out soon afterward, in October 1962.
For the first time in Cold War history, a secret personal
correspondence between two leaders, rather than mutual threats and
propaganda escapades, was the main instrument for resolving a dire
international crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Both the U.S. president and the Soviet leader understood that
although they may have been determined to defend their own national
principles and values, which were incompatible, it was only through
dialogue that they could achieve their common goal of preserving
life on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, when Castro and his companions-in-arms entered
Havana, on Jan. 1, 1959, no one in Moscow took the slightest
interest. The Soviet embassy in Cuba was considered unnecessary and
had closed in 1952. Diplomatic relations continued, but neither an
embassy nor a single Soviet representative remained in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   After reading Western news agency reports about Castro's
triumph, however, Father became curious.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to gather more information, he received the following
reply from the intelligence service and the Party Central
Committee's International Department: ``Castro is the usual Central
American dictator, probably closely connected to the CIA, and will
dance to the American tune, just like Batista.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, when Castro went to Washington expecting to meet with
President Eisenhower, a high-level international specialist from
the Party Central Committee told Father in my presence: ``You see,
Nikita Sergeyevich, we were right. Castro is hurrying to bow to his
master.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Castro intended to conduct a totally independent
policy was evident only later, and Father was the first to
recognize it.
</P>
<P>
   He decided that the only way to defend Cuba from the United
States' inevitable aggression was by deploying missiles with
nuclear warheads on the island. In so doing, he was warning
Washington that military action in that region would automatically
lead to World War III.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963 President Kennedy behaved like Father by declaring that
he was a West Berliner and would defend the city from possible
future Soviet seizure with all the power America possessed. In
economic and other terms, West Berlin was even more useless to
Kennedy than Cuba was to Father.
</P>
<P>
   But the status of a superpower leaves its special mark on the
conduct of world leaders. They have to defend their allies with all
the means available to them. If they retreat an inch, it is
tantamount to bidding farewell to superpower status forever. No one
will believe them any more; such are the implacable rules of the
game in power politics.
</P>
<P>
   It has become customary to argue that Father gave in because of
America's firm stance, that Nikita Khrushchev yielded and blinked
first. In fact, both leaders realized that they would remain in
control of the situation only until the first shot was fired, until
the first bomb was dropped on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   After that, other rules would take over, the rules of war, of a
third world war. And Father loved to say, ``Any fool can start a
war, but then where are we going to find the wise men to stop it?''
</P>
<P>
   Both he and Kennedy tried to prevent that first shot by every
possible means.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kennedy was under tremendous pressure. Father knew
this, and he took it into account when he decided to withdraw the
missiles from Cuba in exchange for Kennedy's promise not to invade
the island _ a promise he trusted.
</P>
<P>
   This would have been inconceivable in 1952: Trust an American
president! When Father argued at a meeting of the Soviet leadership
in favor of withdrawing the missiles, he made this unprecedented
statement: ``We have to help Kennedy withstand pressure from the
hawks. They are demanding an immediate military invasion.''
</P>
<P>
   A little later, after the withdrawal of the Soviet missiles from
Cuba had begun, Kennedy too asked journalists to help Khrushchev by
not crowing about the American victory. Could anyone have imagined
hearing such words in the White House five years earlier?
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to view the Cuban missile crisis superficially as
Kennedy's victory; he forced the Soviet Union to withdraw. And
Father also thought he had won by protecting Cuba from possible
aggression and by averting a great war. In the political game of
brinkmanship, Father stuck to his opinion: He who decides to blink
first doesn't have weaker nerves, but possesses greater wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   The real main consequence of the Cuban missile crisis was the
American society's irrevocable perception of parity, of equality
between the USSR and the United States in shared nuclear
destructive force.
</P>
<P>
   The American media, not Father, were responsible for that. They
so frightened their countrymen into believing that the Soviets
could blast them to eternity that soon it made no sense at all to
talk about nuclear superiority in terms of plain numbers. The
nation's subconscious simply would not absorb them.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the Cuban drama ended the cycle of crises and
missile-bluff diplomacy. Both sides recognized that they could now
inflict a mortal blow capable not only of mutual annihilation but
also of destroying an entire civilization, of ending life on earth.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1963 John F. Kennedy was assassinated; a year later,
in October 1964, my father was removed from power. The leaders who
replaced Father hurried to ``correct his mistakes'' by giving a new
impetus to the arms race and producing tens of thousands of
tactical nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   By 1989 the Soviet army had 7,000 nuclear cannons. The Cold War
was prolonged by 20 years, on through the start of the 1990s when
the Soviet Union dissolved. Was the failure to end the Cold War in
the 1960s a wasted opportunity? Was the world ready for it to end
then? We can only guess, and regret that it did not happen. Could
the Cold War have been avoided? Was it a product of the ill will of
politicians or was it historically inevitable?
</P>
<P>
   For thousands of years peoples have resolved their conflicts by
armed clashes. With the invention of nuclear weapons, however,
diplomats and politicians suddenly realized that war would no
longer lead to victory, that both sides would lose. Yet they didn't
know how to behave differently so they behaved the same way,
belligerently and aggressively, but without going to war.
</P>
<P>
   War without war was called ``cold war.'' A very accurate
definition. And at the start of this process, at the dawn of the
Cold War, when a great deal was still unsettled and all the
destructive consequences of the use of nuclear weapons were not yet
apparent, it would have been very easy to yield to temptation and
drift into a real war.
</P>
<P>
   I consider it a great achievement, a heroic deed of the world
leaders of those years _ primarily Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F.
Kennedy and my father, Nikita Khrushchev _ that they showed the
wisdom to pass safely over the reefs of a hot war and preserve the
life of humankind.

<P>
   My father, Nikita Khrushchev, always favored direct dialogue,
without intermediaries, and in Vienna, in June 1961 he and
President John F. Kennedy _ at what would turn out to be their only
face-to-face meeting _ agreed to establish a direct White
House-to-Kremlin link by means of special couriers. Kennedy
proposed exchanging confidential letters outside of official State
Department channels; my father readily agreed.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pact that would serve the parties well during the Cuban
missile crisis, which broke out soon afterward, in October 1962.
For the first time in Cold War history, a secret personal
correspondence between two leaders, rather than mutual threats and
propaganda escapades, was the main instrument for resolving a dire
international crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Both the U.S. president and the Soviet leader understood that
although they may have been determined to defend their own national
principles and values, which were incompatible, it was only through
dialogue that they could achieve their common goal of preserving
life on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, when Castro and his companions-in-arms entered
Havana, on Jan. 1, 1959, no one in Moscow took the slightest
interest. The Soviet embassy in Cuba was considered unnecessary and
had closed in 1952. Diplomatic relations continued, but neither an
embassy nor a single Soviet representative remained in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   After reading Western news agency reports about Castro's
triumph, however, Father became curious.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to gather more information, he received the following
reply from the intelligence service and the Party Central
Committee's International Department: ``Castro is the usual Central
American dictator, probably closely connected to the CIA, and will
dance to the American tune, just like Batista.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, when Castro went to Washington expecting to meet with
President Eisenhower, a high-level international specialist from
the Party Central Committee told Father in my presence: ``You see,
Nikita Sergeyevich, we were right. Castro is hurrying to bow to his
master.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Castro intended to conduct a totally independent
policy was evident only later, and Father was the first to
recognize it.
</P>
<P>
   He decided that the only way to defend Cuba from the United
States' inevitable aggression was by deploying missiles with
nuclear warheads on the island. In so doing, he was warning
Washington that military action in that region would automatically
lead to World War III.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963 President Kennedy behaved like Father by declaring that
he was a West Berliner and would defend the city from possible
future Soviet seizure with all the power America possessed. In
economic and other terms, West Berlin was even more useless to
Kennedy than Cuba was to Father.
</P>
<P>
   But the status of a superpower leaves its special mark on the
conduct of world leaders. They have to defend their allies with all
the means available to them. If they retreat an inch, it is
tantamount to bidding farewell to superpower status forever. No one
will believe them any more; such are the implacable rules of the
game in power politics.
</P>
<P>
   It has become customary to argue that Father gave in because of
America's firm stance, that Nikita Khrushchev yielded and blinked
first. In fact, both leaders realized that they would remain in
control of the situation only until the first shot was fired, until
the first bomb was dropped on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   After that, other rules would take over, the rules of war, of a
third world war. And Father loved to say, ``Any fool can start a
war, but then where are we going to find the wise men to stop it?''
</P>
<P>
   Both he and Kennedy tried to prevent that first shot by every
possible means.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kennedy was under tremendous pressure. Father knew
this, and he took it into account when he decided to withdraw the
missiles from Cuba in exchange for Kennedy's promise not to invade
the island _ a promise he trusted.
</P>
<P>
   This would have been inconceivable in 1952: Trust an American
president! When Father argued at a meeting of the Soviet leadership
in favor of withdrawing the missiles, he made this unprecedented
statement: ``We have to help Kennedy withstand pressure from the
hawks. They are demanding an immediate military invasion.''
</P>
<P>
   A little later, after the withdrawal of the Soviet missiles from
Cuba had begun, Kennedy too asked journalists to help Khrushchev by
not crowing about the American victory. Could anyone have imagined
hearing such words in the White House five years earlier?
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to view the Cuban missile crisis superficially as
Kennedy's victory; he forced the Soviet Union to withdraw. And
Father also thought he had won by protecting Cuba from possible
aggression and by averting a great war. In the political game of
brinkmanship, Father stuck to his opinion: He who decides to blink
first doesn't have weaker nerves, but possesses greater wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   The real main consequence of the Cuban missile crisis was the
American society's irrevocable perception of parity, of equality
between the USSR and the United States in shared nuclear
destructive force.
</P>
<P>
   The American media, not Father, were responsible for that. They
so frightened their countrymen into believing that the Soviets
could blast them to eternity that soon it made no sense at all to
talk about nuclear superiority in terms of plain numbers. The
nation's subconscious simply would not absorb them.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the Cuban drama ended the cycle of crises and
missile-bluff diplomacy. Both sides recognized that they could now
inflict a mortal blow capable not only of mutual annihilation but
also of destroying an entire civilization, of ending life on earth.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1963 John F. Kennedy was assassinated; a year later,
in October 1964, my father was removed from power. The leaders who
replaced Father hurried to ``correct his mistakes'' by giving a new
impetus to the arms race and producing tens of thousands of
tactical nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   By 1989 the Soviet army had 7,000 nuclear cannons. The Cold War
was prolonged by 20 years, on through the start of the 1990s when
the Soviet Union dissolved. Was the failure to end the Cold War in
the 1960s a wasted opportunity? Was the world ready for it to end
then? We can only guess, and regret that it did not happen. Could
the Cold War have been avoided? Was it a product of the ill will of
politicians or was it historically inevitable?
</P>
<P>
   For thousands of years peoples have resolved their conflicts by
armed clashes. With the invention of nuclear weapons, however,
diplomats and politicians suddenly realized that war would no
longer lead to victory, that both sides would lose. Yet they didn't
know how to behave differently so they behaved the same way,
belligerently and aggressively, but without going to war.
</P>
<P>
   War without war was called ``cold war.'' A very accurate
definition. And at the start of this process, at the dawn of the
Cold War, when a great deal was still unsettled and all the
destructive consequences of the use of nuclear weapons were not yet
apparent, it would have been very easy to yield to temptation and
drift into a real war.
</P>
<P>
   I consider it a great achievement, a heroic deed of the world
leaders of those years _ primarily Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F.
Kennedy and my father, Nikita Khrushchev _ that they showed the
wisdom to pass safely over the reefs of a hot war and preserve the
life of humankind.

ADVICE FOR OSHA ON THE HAZARDS OF WORKING AT HOME
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Wednesday, Jan. 19)  
(DW) 
 By DAVID GRIMES Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was hurt and not a little bit offended that the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration backed off the idea of barging
into the houses of people who work at home to make sure they are
complying with all federal health and safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   As one of 20 million Americans who works at home, I can tell you
that a telecommuter's life can be a lonely one and that there are
many of us who would have found the sound of heavy boots kicking in
our front door a welcome interruption to our dull, dreary routines.
</P>
<P>
   Call me an incurable romantic, but to me nothing breaks up the
day like a beefy federal agent leading me away in handcuffs for
having an insufficient wattage bulb in my desk lamp or for leaving
old newspapers scattered about in a way that could cause people to
trip and fall.
</P>
<P>
   The message that OSHA puts out, by rescinding its directive, is
that doing office work at home is not dangerous enough to warrant
its involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said as much when she told
reporters that OSHA's concern with work at home has always involved
hazardous jobs such as building fireworks and that she does not
consider working from home at a computer to be ``high risk.''
</P>
<P>
   While I would agree with Ms. Herman that people who work from
home are unlikely to make the kind of mistake that breaks windows a
mile away and creates a 30-foot-deep crater where their house used
to be, our occupation is not without its hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommuting is a lot more than sitting at your kitchen table
in your underwear staring at a computer screen, which is not to say
that these activities are entirely risk-free. (Spilling coffee on
your lap can result in far more painful burns than if you were
wearing pants.)
</P>
<P>
   Even as we speak, I am experiencing discomfort in my wrist from
holding up my head with my hand, trying to think what to write
next. Also, my back is stiffening up from sitting in my
ergonomically incorrect office chair, which even the most
unobservant OSHA agent would surely recognize as an old stool.
</P>
<P>
   I am trying to write fast because a TV show I like comes on at
noon, and that is causing a tension headache directly above my
right eye. Sometimes it is difficult to go back to work after a
hard half-hour of TV watching, and that leads to a mild case of
depression that might require a long nap (possibility of traumatic
nightmares and pillow hair) followed by a dip in the pool (chlorine
blur, swimsuit chafe).
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes that means that I miss my deadline, resulting in a
snippy call from my editor, sendingme spiraling into a black hole
of self-recrimination, the only cure for which is 18 holes of golf
(sunburn, compulsive gambling disorder).
</P>
<P>
   All of which explains who so many people who work from home on
their computers describe the life as a ``treadmill' or a ``living
hell'' depending on what kind of cable package they subscribe to.
</P>
<P>
   Just because we don't blow ourselves up on a regular basis like
fireworks-builders do, OSHA seems to be of the opinion that
telecommuting is nothing more than a quiet day in the den where the
biggest hazard is jabbing yourself in the eye with a bologna
sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, nothing could be further from the truth, which is why I
hope OSHA eventually starts sending out agents to make home
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   While he's on his way, if the agent that comes to my house could
pick up a couple of videos and tube of sun screen, so much the
better.

 &HT;        DISPARITY OF WEALTH WIDENED IN 1990s, STUDY SAYS 
 &HT;     By Alex Canizares  
 &HT;    c. 2000 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 - Despite economic prosperity and low
unemployment, the income gap between the rich and poor widened in
the nation and in Texas in the 1990s, continuing a trend of
disparity of wealth from the 1970s, according to a new report.
</P>
<P>
   While the wealthiest Texans have seen steady income gains over
the past 20 years, the report shows middle and lower classes have
hardly benefited. The richest fifth of Texas families saw their
income jump 23 percent from the late 1970s to the 1990s, but the
poorest fifth of Texas residents saw their incomes fall by 9
percent, and the middle fifth drop by 4 percent, over the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   The state-by-state study, released this week by two left-leaning
think tanks, the Economic Policy Institute and the Center on Budget
and Policy Priorities, is based on the latest Census statistics of
income before taxes. The capital gains tax and the cash welfare
system were not factored in the study.
</P>
<P>
   While the richest fifth of Americans saw their income grow 15
percent from the late 1980s to the late 1990s, the incomes of the
poorest and middle fifths remained relatively unchanged, growing by
one and two percent, respectively. The richest 5 percent of the
country saw their incomes jump 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The study said income inequality is caused in part by an uneven
wage scale. ``Wages at the bottom and middle of the wage scale have
been stagnant or have declined over the last two decades,'' the
report said. ``The wages of the very highest paid employees,
however, have grown significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Veitch, chair of the economics department at the
University of San Francisco, said he was skeptical of the report's
findings that poor families' income stagnated in the 1990s, given
the country's low unemployment rate, rising productivity, low
inflation and a hike in the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas and eight other states, including New York, Arizona,
Louisiana, New Mexico and California, the average income in the
late 1990s of the richest fifth of families was more than 11 times
greater than the average income of families in the bottom fifth of
the income scale. For Texas, the top fifth made an average of
$130,302, compared to $11,200 for the bottom fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' trend of declining wages for the state's middle class
over the long term was not replicated nationwide. The middle fifth
of families nationwide have seen their income go up by 5 percent
from the late 1970s to the late 1990s, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, ``it's not just the people at the bottom that are
falling behind,'' said Dick Lavine, senior fiscal analyst at the
Center for Public Policy Priorities in Austin. ``The main issue is
that everybody contributed to the economic growth, but only the top
fifth have really benefited.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavine said in Texas, a lack of access to education is a reason
for the disparity. Also, high technology industries have given a
financial boost to the wealthiest but not the poorest, he said.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   My father, Nikita Khrushchev, did not doubt the superiority and
greater economic efficiency of socialism over capitalism, and was
sure that sooner or later capitalism would die out and that he
would bury it.
</P>
<P>
   Father wanted to have a look, however fleeting, at what Soviet
life would be like under true communism _ in other words, when
Russians lived no worse than Americans, those very Americans who
dreamed of destroying communism.
</P>
<P>
   But, as he said in one of his speeches in the United States,
``You Americans work better than we do and produce goods that we
can only dream about, so we will learn from you; we will study
diligently. And once we've learned, we'll begin working better than
you. And you will just have to jump onto the running board of the
train of socialism, which is leaving for the future. Otherwise,
you'll be left far behind and we will wave good-bye from the rear
platform of the last car.''
</P>
<P>
   Father believed that the governmental system that gave people
the best living standards would win. That was the sole criterion.
Nothing would help the losing side _ not nuclear bombs, ideological
dogmas or propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   To the end of his life, he was convinced that Soviet socialism
would come out on top, and he died secure in that belief. His goal
was never to win by competition in the field of weaponry. He was
not captivated by the missile race or even by the space race.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, his slogan became the ``food race.'' Fences, walls of
buildings and outdoor billboards were plastered with signs,
reading: ``Catch up and pass the United States in per capita
production of meat, milk and butter.'' In fact, we were in no
condition to compete in this sphere. Our people were emerging
painfully from a condition of semistarvation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, only a madman or traitor could neglect the nation's
security during the Cold War. Because we sorely lacked resources,
our most important decision would be how to strengthen the
country's security at the same time as reducing military spending.
</P>
<P>
   Father believed that future local wars could not be waged
without nuclear weapons. This, he thought, made it senseless to
maintain a gigantic army. Nor would it make sense to continue
pouring money into conventional weapons, so he proposed reducing
the Soviet production of tanks, cannons and tactical aircraft. Of
course the military opposed this with all its might.
</P>
<P>
   The military professionals were demanding that the Soviet army,
air force and navy be given equipment precisely symmetrical to all
that of the mighty U.S. military. However, this would have consumed
all our nation's financial resources, leaving nothing in the budget
for housing or to provide people with normal lives.
</P>
<P>
   Father chose a different path. He tried to make the admirals and
generals understand that the United States was much wealthier than
we were. If we competed with the Americans on that basis, he
reasoned, we would spend all our resources in vain and bring the
country to ruin, and even then not reach parity.
</P>
<P>
   In one meeting, when the military stood its ground Father
angrily exclaimed, ``You'll leave the country stark naked!''
</P>
<P>
   Father finally decided to make use of his power and authority.
He made the tough decision to formulate an asymmetrical defense
doctrine. He thought that we ourselves could determine the
necessary minimum to ensure the country's security _ and whatever
we didn't need we would ruthlessly eliminate.
</P>
<P>
   He started with the navy. Stalin had planned to build an
oceangoing surface fleet able to compete with America's. Our
admirals needed about 130 billion rubles (roughly $32.5 billion) in
the 1955-'65 period to carry out the second stage of Stalin's
program _ an enormous sum. The only way to get it was to cut funds
for essential human needs.
</P>
<P>
   Discussion of the program continued for about a year with no
progress. Once, Father posed a direct question to the navy's
commander in chief, Adm. Nikolai Kuznetsov: ``If today, and not 10
years from now, you had all the ships you're asking for, could you
defeat the Americans at sea?''
</P>
<P>
   The admiral gave a militarily direct answer: ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   The discussion ended with the decision to stop building a
surface fleet and limit construction to submarines, primarily
missile submarines, and antisubmarine and shore-defense forces.
</P>
<P>
   To this day the Russian naval officers have never forgiven
Father, but he simply would not give them money to waste.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat later, strategic aviation met a similar fate. Its
development was held to a minimum, while preference was given to
ballistic missiles. From then on, our air force officers also
disliked Father.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, by 1956, only one type of Soviet ballistic missile was
being built, the R-5M, with a nuclear warhead of 70 kilotons. The
USSR had a total of 426 nuclear warheads. In comparison, the United
States had an overall nuclear superiority 10.8 times greater.
</P>
<P>
   And so, believing it was necessary to restrain the West from a
possible attack on the Soviet Union, Father decided to resort to
bluff and intimidation. For example, in April 1956, during his
visit to England he casually inquired _ during an official lunch
and again over tea at the fireplace of the prime minister's country
residence at Chequers _ if his hosts knew how many nuclear warheads
it would take to wipe their island off the face of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   An awkward silence followed.
</P>
<P>
   But with a broad smile on his face, Father informed those
present that if they didn't know, he could help them _ and he
mentioned a specific number. Then he added, quite cheerfully, ``And
we have lots of those nuclear warheads, as well as the missiles to
deliver them.''
</P>
<P>
   From then on Father reacted just as sharply to every crisis in
the vicinity of the Soviet Union, whether in the Near East, the Far
East or Europe. By frightening the world with the idea of Soviet
missile superiority, he hoped our side would be taken as equal to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It was in those years that he used the famous phrase, ``We are
producing missiles like sausages.''
</P>
<P>
   When I asked him how he could say that _ we knew, after all,
that the Soviet Union had no more than half a dozen
intercontinental missiles _ Father only laughed: ``We're not
planning to start a war, so it doesn't matter how many missiles are
deployed. The main thing is that Americans think we have enough for
a powerful strike in response. So they'll be wary of attacking
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The history of the ``global nuclear ballistic missile contest''
was similar. The project required launching a nuclear warhead into
an earth orbit. Then, at the command from earth, it would explode
over an enemy on a trajectory that couldn't be predicted by any
sort of antimissile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   The organization where I worked, which was located in a
carefully guarded area, had several even-more-secret rooms where we
worked on our new superweapon.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, just a few months after we started, Father joyfully
informed journalists at a press conference that the Soviet Union
would soon possess a global missile, a weapon against which no
defense existed. I was profoundly upset and thought of his
loquaciousness as a betrayal of our national interests.
</P>
<P>
   That evening during a walk I voiced my complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't tell me you thought the government would actually allow
someone to launch a nuclear warhead into orbit,'' he retorted with
amazement. ``What if something happened to it in orbit, in space?
We would be hostages to our own thoughtlessness. The global missile
is a propaganda weapon. Let the Americans rack their brains over
what I said.''
</P>
<P>
   Now here is the truth: Such statements by Father were in fact
received with enthusiasm in the West because they made it easier
for the U.S. military to receive additional funds. The missile race
was born and gained strength, as John F. Kennedy entered the White
House. Yet all along this race, which never existed _ or rather, in
which America alone took part _ was an internal U.S. competition to
see which branch of the military could grab more funds from the
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Insofar as there was a real race, the United States always led.
For example, large numbers of the UR-100 (SS-11) light ballistic
missiles were deployed in the Soviet Union, beginning in 1967, five
years later than the analogous U.S. Minuteman I. The CIA surely
knew this, but the myth of Soviet superiority was useful, or seemed
useful, not so much to the Soviets and my father as to the American
military-industrial complex.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenhower understood this very well. He and Father met at Camp
David in September of 1959. One day, as they were walking and
chatting, Eisenhower brought up the subject of relations with the
military, asking Father how he coped with his generals. Father
reacted cautiously. He was not prepared to discuss such a sensitive
subject with an American president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I'll start,'' said Eisenhower, smiling. ``My military
leaders come to me several times a year to ask for additional
appropriations for new types of weapons. When I reply that the
budget has been approved and printed and there's no place to find
the money, they begin frightening me by saying that the Soviet
Union is already developing such 'toys,' and I'll be responsible if
the United States is defeated in a future war. Naturally then, I
have to give them the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Father replied that he too was often subjected to such pressure
from his own military-industrial complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we should make a secret agreement between us to curb our
military,'' Eisenhower proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be good,'' Father responded. ``But the time has not
yet come.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   My father, Nikita Khrushchev, did not doubt the superiority and
greater economic efficiency of socialism over capitalism, and was
sure that sooner or later capitalism would die out and that he
would bury it.
</P>
<P>
   Father wanted to have a look, however fleeting, at what Soviet
life would be like under true communism _ in other words, when
Russians lived no worse than Americans, those very Americans who
dreamed of destroying communism.
</P>
<P>
   But, as he said in one of his speeches in the United States,
``You Americans work better than we do and produce goods that we
can only dream about, so we will learn from you; we will study
diligently. And once we've learned, we'll begin working better than
you. And you will just have to jump onto the running board of the
train of socialism, which is leaving for the future. Otherwise,
you'll be left far behind and we will wave good-bye from the rear
platform of the last car.''
</P>
<P>
   Father believed that the governmental system that gave people
the best living standards would win. That was the sole criterion.
Nothing would help the losing side _ not nuclear bombs, ideological
dogmas or propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   To the end of his life, he was convinced that Soviet socialism
would come out on top, and he died secure in that belief. His goal
was never to win by competition in the field of weaponry. He was
not captivated by the missile race or even by the space race.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, his slogan became the ``food race.'' Fences, walls of
buildings and outdoor billboards were plastered with signs,
reading: ``Catch up and pass the United States in per capita
production of meat, milk and butter.'' In fact, we were in no
condition to compete in this sphere. Our people were emerging
painfully from a condition of semistarvation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, only a madman or traitor could neglect the nation's
security during the Cold War. Because we sorely lacked resources,
our most important decision would be how to strengthen the
country's security at the same time as reducing military spending.
</P>
<P>
   Father believed that future local wars could not be waged
without nuclear weapons. This, he thought, made it senseless to
maintain a gigantic army. Nor would it make sense to continue
pouring money into conventional weapons, so he proposed reducing
the Soviet production of tanks, cannons and tactical aircraft. Of
course the military opposed this with all its might.
</P>
<P>
   The military professionals were demanding that the Soviet army,
air force and navy be given equipment precisely symmetrical to all
that of the mighty U.S. military. However, this would have consumed
all our nation's financial resources, leaving nothing in the budget
for housing or to provide people with normal lives.
</P>
<P>
   Father chose a different path. He tried to make the admirals and
generals understand that the United States was much wealthier than
we were. If we competed with the Americans on that basis, he
reasoned, we would spend all our resources in vain and bring the
country to ruin, and even then not reach parity.
</P>
<P>
   In one meeting, when the military stood its ground Father
angrily exclaimed, ``You'll leave the country stark naked!''
</P>
<P>
   Father finally decided to make use of his power and authority.
He made the tough decision to formulate an asymmetrical defense
doctrine. He thought that we ourselves could determine the
necessary minimum to ensure the country's security _ and whatever
we didn't need we would ruthlessly eliminate.
</P>
<P>
   He started with the navy. Stalin had planned to build an
oceangoing surface fleet able to compete with America's. Our
admirals needed about 130 billion rubles (roughly $32.5 billion) in
the 1955-'65 period to carry out the second stage of Stalin's
program _ an enormous sum. The only way to get it was to cut funds
for essential human needs.
</P>
<P>
   Discussion of the program continued for about a year with no
progress. Once, Father posed a direct question to the navy's
commander in chief, Adm. Nikolai Kuznetsov: ``If today, and not 10
years from now, you had all the ships you're asking for, could you
defeat the Americans at sea?''
</P>
<P>
   The admiral gave a militarily direct answer: ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   The discussion ended with the decision to stop building a
surface fleet and limit construction to submarines, primarily
missile submarines, and antisubmarine and shore-defense forces.
</P>
<P>
   To this day the Russian naval officers have never forgiven
Father, but he simply would not give them money to waste.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat later, strategic aviation met a similar fate. Its
development was held to a minimum, while preference was given to
ballistic missiles. From then on, our air force officers also
disliked Father.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, by 1956, only one type of Soviet ballistic missile was
being built, the R-5M, with a nuclear warhead of 70 kilotons. The
USSR had a total of 426 nuclear warheads. In comparison, the United
States had an overall nuclear superiority 10.8 times greater.
</P>
<P>
   And so, believing it was necessary to restrain the West from a
possible attack on the Soviet Union, Father decided to resort to
bluff and intimidation. For example, in April 1956, during his
visit to England he casually inquired _ during an official lunch
and again over tea at the fireplace of the prime minister's country
residence at Chequers _ if his hosts knew how many nuclear warheads
it would take to wipe their island off the face of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   An awkward silence followed.
</P>
<P>
   But with a broad smile on his face, Father informed those
present that if they didn't know, he could help them _ and he
mentioned a specific number. Then he added, quite cheerfully, ``And
we have lots of those nuclear warheads, as well as the missiles to
deliver them.''
</P>
<P>
   From then on Father reacted just as sharply to every crisis in
the vicinity of the Soviet Union, whether in the Near East, the Far
East or Europe. By frightening the world with the idea of Soviet
missile superiority, he hoped our side would be taken as equal to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It was in those years that he used the famous phrase, ``We are
producing missiles like sausages.''
</P>
<P>
   When I asked him how he could say that _ we knew, after all,
that the Soviet Union had no more than half a dozen
intercontinental missiles _ Father only laughed: ``We're not
planning to start a war, so it doesn't matter how many missiles are
deployed. The main thing is that Americans think we have enough for
a powerful strike in response. So they'll be wary of attacking
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The history of the ``global nuclear ballistic missile contest''
was similar. The project required launching a nuclear warhead into
an earth orbit. Then, at the command from earth, it would explode
over an enemy on a trajectory that couldn't be predicted by any
sort of antimissile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   The organization where I worked, which was located in a
carefully guarded area, had several even-more-secret rooms where we
worked on our new superweapon.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, just a few months after we started, Father joyfully
informed journalists at a press conference that the Soviet Union
would soon possess a global missile, a weapon against which no
defense existed. I was profoundly upset and thought of his
loquaciousness as a betrayal of our national interests.
</P>
<P>
   That evening during a walk I voiced my complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't tell me you thought the government would actually allow
someone to launch a nuclear warhead into orbit,'' he retorted with
amazement. ``What if something happened to it in orbit, in space?
We would be hostages to our own thoughtlessness. The global missile
is a propaganda weapon. Let the Americans rack their brains over
what I said.''
</P>
<P>
   Now here is the truth: Such statements by Father were in fact
received with enthusiasm in the West because they made it easier
for the U.S. military to receive additional funds. The missile race
was born and gained strength, as John F. Kennedy entered the White
House. Yet all along this race, which never existed _ or rather, in
which America alone took part _ was an internal U.S. competition to
see which branch of the military could grab more funds from the
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Insofar as there was a real race, the United States always led.
For example, large numbers of the UR-100 (SS-11) light ballistic
missiles were deployed in the Soviet Union, beginning in 1967, five
years later than the analogous U.S. Minuteman I. The CIA surely
knew this, but the myth of Soviet superiority was useful, or seemed
useful, not so much to the Soviets and my father as to the American
military-industrial complex.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenhower understood this very well. He and Father met at Camp
David in September of 1959. One day, as they were walking and
chatting, Eisenhower brought up the subject of relations with the
military, asking Father how he coped with his generals. Father
reacted cautiously. He was not prepared to discuss such a sensitive
subject with an American president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I'll start,'' said Eisenhower, smiling. ``My military
leaders come to me several times a year to ask for additional
appropriations for new types of weapons. When I reply that the
budget has been approved and printed and there's no place to find
the money, they begin frightening me by saying that the Soviet
Union is already developing such 'toys,' and I'll be responsible if
the United States is defeated in a future war. Naturally then, I
have to give them the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Father replied that he too was often subjected to such pressure
from his own military-industrial complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we should make a secret agreement between us to curb our
military,'' Eisenhower proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be good,'' Father responded. ``But the time has not
yet come.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the moment for confidential relations between Soviet and
American leaders truly had not yet come but by 1959, a great deal
had changed. Eisenhower and Father had learned to talk to each
other, and the first signs of mutual confidence had appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Thus a foundation was built for the future negotiations between
Father and President John F. Kennedy, between Leonid Brezhnev and a
series of U.S. presidents, as well as between Mikhail Gorbachev and
Ronald Reagan.
</P>

<P>
   When the Cold War began, Russians my age were in school, and
when it ended, we were already thinking about retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Our lives were spent amid the fear that America _ our great
national enemy _ would strike a fatal blow if we made the slightest
false step or showed the least weakness. For Americans, of course,
the Soviet Union was the Evil Empire. But for Russians, the United
States was the Evil Empire.
</P>
<P>
   Most of my life was spent in Russia. When, as a mature adult, I
came to the United States, I was amazed at all the parallels
between our respective fears and determination to defend our ideals
and our countries.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, each Cold War power came very close to seizing the
other by the throat in a fit of righteous indignation. In defense
of national ideals, each side verged on using force to make the
other admit it was wrong (always a hopeless approach).
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the statesmanlike and human wisdom of the leaders of
both countries _ and luck _ we succeeded in avoiding a violent
``resolution'' to the ideological quarrel. On its own, the Cold War
expired and, having survived, we can look back now and even joke
about our recent past.
</P>
<P>
   Today we know how close we came to World War III. Now many
secrets are secrets no longer: We know that at the time of Joseph
Stalin's death in 1953, everything seemed to be heading toward a
real war, a nuclear war. The Soviet dictator had ordered an
accelerated buildup of the armed forces not only of the Soviet
Union but also the Warsaw Pact allies, in order to be fully ready
for an armed clash by 1954 or 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Motivated by fear, Stalin ordered that 10,000 tactical IL-28
Soviet bombers, with a range of about 1,500 miles, be produced and
stationed at airfields built on the Arctic Ocean icecaps, closer
than the Soviet empire was to U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Soviet military personnel had reached 5,394,038,
an insupportable burden for a peacetime economy. And yet Stalin
could have done little in case of conflict because the U.S.
strategic Air Force, whose bases surrounded the Soviet Union, could
have destroyed whatever it chose.
</P>
<P>
   Stalin did not possess a weapon capable of responding with a
comparable retaliatory strike on American territory. He knew this
and was deathly afraid of war, but at the same time he considered
it inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1952 I finished school and began studying at the
Electric Power Institute in Moscow. I wanted to become an engineer
in the field of automated control. At the time, we students were
inclined to be militant, even aggressive: ``Just let them (whomever
you like) poke their noses in here and we'll show them a thing or
two.''
</P>
<P>
   At our desks in school we, like our leaders in the Kremlin, felt
sure that war was not far off.
</P>
<P>
   When America elected Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, a hero of World
War II, as president in November 1952, we had no doubt of what it
meant: ``The USA has decided to fight. Otherwise why do they need a
general as president?''
</P>
<P>
   Not that, after living through the horrors of the German
bombings in World War II, we were frightened by the atomic bomb. We
flaunted our courage.
</P>
<P>
   During civil defense classes we were told to cover ourselves
with something white, preferably a sheet, in the event of a nuclear
blast. Supposedly this would reduce the impact of radiation. And
so, a joke immediately went the rounds:
</P>
<P>
   ``If an atomic bomb explodes, cover yourself with a sheet and
crawl to the cemetery _ but without hurrying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why without hurrying?''
</P>
<P>
   ``So as not to cause a panic.''
</P>
<P>
   However, on March 5, 1953, Providence intervened: Stalin died.
And my father, Nikita Khrushchev, who soon became the head of the
new Soviet leadership, knew from personal experience what war was
like. He had traveled the country's roads for four years during
World War II, retreating from our western borders to Stalingrad and
advancing from Stalingrad to Kiev.
</P>
<P>
   From his first months in power he tried to discern whether the
Americans were irrevocably bent on war or whether it was possible
to reach agreement with them. Interestingly, the White House was
thinking more or less along the same lines.
</P>
<P>
   The first time my father and President Eisenhower met (aside
from a fleeting encounter in June 1945 atop the Lenin Mausoleum,
during a Victory Day Parade in Moscow) was in Geneva in 1955, at
the Four-Power Summit Conference.
</P>
<P>
   In preparing for the trip to Geneva, Father had tried to
anticipate every minor detail; he wanted to prevent any sign of
U.S. disrespect or discrimination against our country.
</P>
<P>
   Still, right away, our national pride was wounded, but not
because of any malicious scheme by the West. The Soviet delegation
arrived in Switzerland on a small two-engine IL-14, while President
Eisenhower landed in a giant four-engine Constellation. That did
not escape Father's attention.
</P>
<P>
   The next year he took his revenge during a visit to England. A
TU-104 passenger jet, which had not yet completed all its test
flights, brought his mail from Moscow to London every day. Even the
Americans did not yet have such a plane. The British queen, hearing
an unusual roar coming from the sky (as she told Father later when
they met), went out on the balcony of her palace to gape at the
marvel.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, the process of getting acquainted was not without its
bizarre moments. During one of the breaks between sessions,
Eisenhower introduced Father to his assistant _ then it was Nelson
Rockefeller. Father inquired, ``Is he THAT Rockefeller?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was.
</P>
<P>
   A multimillionaire, but looking no different from anyone else,
as Father later would tell me, not in top hat and tails but
modestly dressed and, moreover, serving in a subordinate position.
</P>
<P>
   Right away, Father was dying to touch a real multimillionaire,
but he didn't know how such a gesture would be interpreted. He
didn't hesitate for long, though, but spread his arms and embraced
Rockefeller somewhere around the waist _ ``Rocky'' was a head and a
half taller than Father.
</P>
<P>
   At first Rockefeller was taken aback, but after a moment he
responded in kind, bearhugging my father.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard for us now, in America or in Russia, to imagine that
era and how distant we were and how little we understood each
other. Such personal episodes were more valuable then than any
round of official negotiations, which were as yet essentially
unproductive.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Father would conclude that he could do business with
Eisenhower, who of course had also experienced the recent war
firsthand and was not about to seek a new one. But a long and
difficult path lay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   At the Four Power Summit, Eisenhower presented his Open Skies
plan, which would have allowed each side to fly over the other's
territory in order to prevent a surprise attack. Father rejected it
outright.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Eisenhower feared a Soviet attack. But Father was afraid
of something quite different. In the process of flying over our
country, America might discover how much weaker we were than they.
This was our most important secret _ the truth of our inadequate
power. Its discovery might prompt the United States to believe it
could carry out a preventive strike against us.

strategic Air Force, whose bases surrounded the Soviet Union, could
have destroyed whatever it chose.
</P>
<P>
   Stalin did not possess a weapon capable of responding with a
comparable retaliatory strike on American territory. He knew this
and was deathly afraid of war, but at the same time he considered
it inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1952 I finished school and began studying at the
Electric Power Institute in Moscow. I wanted to become an engineer
in the field of automated control. At the time, we students were
inclined to be militant, even aggressive: ``Just let them (whomever
you like) poke their noses in here and we'll show them a thing or
two.''
</P>
<P>
   At our desks in school we, like our leaders in the Kremlin, felt
sure that war was not far off.
</P>
<P>
   When America elected Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, a hero of World
War II, as president in November 1952, we had no doubt of what it
meant: ``The USA has decided to fight. Otherwise why do they need a
general as president?''
</P>
<P>
   Not that, after living through the horrors of the German
bombings in World War II, we were frightened by the atomic bomb. We
flaunted our courage.
</P>
<P>
   During civil defense classes we were told to cover ourselves
with something white, preferably a sheet, in the event of a nuclear
blast. Supposedly this would reduce the impact of radiation. And
so, a joke immediately went the rounds:
</P>
<P>
   ``If an atomic bomb explodes, cover yourself with a sheet and
crawl to the cemetery _ but without hurrying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why without hurrying?''
</P>
<P>
   ``So as not to cause a panic.''
</P>
<P>
   However, on March 5, 1953, Providence intervened: Stalin died.
And my father, Nikita Khrushchev, who soon became the head of the
new Soviet leadership, knew from personal experience what war was
like. He had traveled the country's roads for four years during
World War II, retreating from our western borders to Stalingrad and
advancing from Stalingrad to Kiev.
</P>
<P>
   From his first months in power he tried to discern whether the
Americans were irrevocably bent on war or whether it was possible
to reach agreement with them. Interestingly, the White House was
thinking more or less along the same lines.
</P>
<P>
   The first time my father and President Eisenhower met (aside
from a fleeting encounter in June 1945 atop the Lenin Mausoleum,
during a Victory Day Parade in Moscow) was in Geneva in 1955, at
the Four-Power Summit Conference.
</P>
<P>
   In preparing for the trip to Geneva, Father had tried to
anticipate every minor detail; he wanted to prevent any sign of
U.S. disrespect or discrimination against our country.
</P>
<P>
   Still, right away, our national pride was wounded, but not
because of any malicious scheme by the West. The Soviet delegation
arrived in Switzerland on a small two-engine IL-14, while President
Eisenhower landed in a giant four-engine Constellation. That did
not escape Father's attention.
</P>
<P>
   The next year he took his revenge during a visit to England. A
TU-104 passenger jet, which had not yet completed all its test
flights, brought his mail from Moscow to London every day. Even the
Americans did not yet have such a plane. The British queen, hearing
an unusual roar coming from the sky (as she told Father later when
they met), went out on the balcony of her palace to gape at the
marvel.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, the process of getting acquainted was not without its
bizarre moments. During one of the breaks between sessions,
Eisenhower introduced Father to his assistant _ then it was Nelson
Rockefeller. Father inquired, ``Is he THAT Rockefeller?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was.
</P>
<P>
   A multimillionaire, but looking no different from anyone else,
as Father later would tell me, not in top hat and tails but
modestly dressed and, moreover, serving in a subordinate position.
</P>
<P>
   Right away, Father was dying to touch a real multimillionaire,
but he didn't know how such a gesture would be interpreted. He
didn't hesitate for long, though, but spread his arms and embraced
Rockefeller somewhere around the waist _ ``Rocky'' was a head and a
half taller than Father.
</P>
<P>
   At first Rockefeller was taken aback, but after a moment he
responded in kind, bearhugging my father.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard for us now, in America or in Russia, to imagine that
era and how distant we were and how little we understood each
other. Such personal episodes were more valuable then than any
round of official negotiations, which were as yet essentially
unproductive.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Father would conclude that he could do business with
Eisenhower, who of course had also experienced the recent war
firsthand and was not about to seek a new one. But a long and
difficult path lay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   At the Four Power Summit, Eisenhower presented his Open Skies
plan, which would have allowed each side to fly over the other's
territory in order to prevent a surprise attack. Father rejected it
outright.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Eisenhower feared a Soviet attack. But Father was afraid
of something quite different. In the process of flying over our
country, America might discover how much weaker we were than they.
This was our most important secret _ the truth of our inadequate
power. Its discovery might prompt the United States to believe it
could carry out a preventive strike against us.

NEW MUSEUM HOPES TO BECOME `THE SMITHSONIAN OF SEX' 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NORTON-ART-DONATE) 
(bl) 
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Among the 29 institutions receiving art from the
collectors Peter and Eileen Norton is the nascent Museum of Sex in
Manhattan, the first of its kind in the United States. Its
president and chief executive, Daniel Gluck, an energetic,
quick-talking 31-year-old former product manager for a software
company, describes the museum, which does not yet have a home, as a
center for the study of ``the history and evolution of human
sexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Its goal, Gluck added, is to become ``the Smithsonian of sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, when Gluck came up with the idea for the museum
as a nonprofit institution, he approached various foundations for
support. But ``even organizations like the Playboy Foundation were
hesitant,'' he said. ``We had trouble incorporating with the New
York Board of Regents as a nonprofit because it said the term
Museum of Sex made a mockery of the institution of the museum.''
</P>
<P>
   So with the money he had made from his software company, he
joined with several partners to acquire a site at the corner of
Fifth Avenue and 27th Street and established the museum as a
for-profit corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Last year architects were commissioned to design the museum
building. Their proposal calls for an undulating facade of various
translucent layers.
</P>
<P>
   The architects have written that the project is an ``ambient
blending of trajectories, space and form'' that ``collects and
redirects forces to provide a spatial solution that is open,
gestural, revealing and sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gluck said the building would not be completed until 2004.
Meanwhile the museum is looking for temporary quarters for
exhibition space, a cafe, a shop, what he calls a resource center
for ``sex studies'' and space for the museum's collection of
``sex-related art and objects.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't necessarily know what we mean by sex objects,''
he quickly added. ``We're talking about anti-masturbation devices
that were used by mental institutions in the Victorian era, and
about the `bundling board,' a Puritan-era bed that a couple would
sleep in before marriage, which would prevent any sexual activity
between them.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum is planning several exhibitions. ``Cagey City:
History of Sex in New York City,'' which Gluck hopes will open in
the fall, will be designed by the artist Louise Bourgeois, he said.
Other planned shows include ``Future Sex,'' ``Lawful Sex'' (about
the ``evolution of obscenity law and sexual freedom in the United
States from the 1700s to the present'') and what Gluck calls ``our
blockbuster'' for the opening in 2004, ``Sex in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Nortons' donation the museum had no art. Knowing
Norton's receptivity to unconventional dreams, Alison Maddex, the
museum's director, contacted the Norton Foundation more than a year
ago in search of money. Instead, Norton and his staff donated a
package of art by Alexis Rockman, Peter Saul, Haim Steinbach and
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first contribution of erotic art we've received,''
Gluck said. ``Obviously it's an important step for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum, which has a Web site (www.museumofsex.org), has
raised more than $1 million in the last year in loans and
investments toward the construction of a temporary home, Gluck
said. He declined to name the backers or to estimate the costs and
budget of the museum.
</P>
<P>
   He speculated that the museum's financial independence should
protect it from the sort of attacks directed at the Brooklyn museum
during ``Sensation.'' ``Although we may upset people, we're not
taking any of the king's coin.''

`LOST ON EVEREST': CLUES BUT NO ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end of review; check local times)  
 (bl)  
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tuesday night's installment of ``Nova'' on PBS tugs you into two
real-life dramas that unfolded, 75 years apart, on the frozen
slopes of Mount Everest. At times, the effort to keep the threads
of the two untangled seem as dizzying as the thin Himalayan air,
but you'll find the effort exhilarating.
</P>
<P>
   In 1924, when no one had yet climbed to Everest's 29,000-foot
summit, the British adventurer George Mallory (the man who said he
wanted to conquer Everest ``because it is there'') made his third
ascent of the mountain in the company of a countryman, Andrew
Irvine. The two men were last seen by other members of their party
some 1,000 feet below the mountain's summit, the highest point on
Earth. What happened to them and whether they made it to the top
remained mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, members of an expedition organized by ``Nova'' sought
to solve those mysteries and to add their own names to the select
list of successful visitors to the top of the world. (Sir Edmund
Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, who reached the summit in 1953, are
credited with being the first to do so. Since then, about 600
others have also made it to the top.)
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's hourlong film, ``Lost on Everest,'' is as
deliberate as an experienced climber. It introduces Mallory and his
era, through historical film and photographs, and takes you along
with his modern successors, who are all eager to offer chipper
monologues for the camera, even at such heights. They seem to feel
obliged not only to speak about Mallory but to speak for him as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest was regarded as the third pole,'' said Graham Hoyland,
a member of the ``Nova'' team whose great-uncle was in Mallory's
group. ``The South Pole and the North Pole had been done, and this
was the last big challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvine's ice ax had been found in the 1930s, and in 1975 a
Chinese climber, who died shortly afterward, reported seeing a body
high on Everest that he described as ``an English dead.'' That body
may be Irvine's and may still be on the mountain, but last year's
expedition chanced upon Mallory's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked over to my right,'' says one of the team members,
Conrad Anker, ``and I saw a patch of white that wasn't a rock, and
it wasn't snow.'' It was Mallory's skin, still showing the
black-and-blue marks of bruises sustained in a fall that may have
led to his death. (The body is shown briefly and discreetly.) His
pockets yielded a knife, a pair of snow goggles, a pencil, a tube
of zinc oxide and other items, but not the camera that the
searchers hoped would tell them whether Mallory reached the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the ``Nova'' climbers, in high-tech gear undreamed of in
Mallory's day, set out for the top, and two made it, but they
couldn't tote their camera on that last leg either. So while the
film, written and produced by Liesl Clark, contains some
breathtaking vistas, that ultimate view, although it has been
filmed by other expeditions, remains just out of reach for Tuesday
night's armchair adventurers.
</P>
<P>
   Everest still holds some secrets. The ``Nova'' climbers are
divided about whether Mallory made it to the top. Maybe Irvine, and
that camera, will someday be found. Then again, maybe some
mysteries are better left unsolved.

 &HT;    UPN: The Testosterone Channel
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Hammer locks and guys in masks. A water skier
on a lake of fire. Monster trucks rolling over each other.
</P>
<P>
   UPN is the network of boys and their toys, a place not unlike a
treehouse with a sign reading ``No Gurlz Allowed.'' (OK, they can
watch ``Moesha,'' but then it's back to grapplin' and cussin' and
blowin' things up.)
</P>
<P>
   ``If it has high testosterone, we'll air it,'' says Dean
Valentine, UPN's president and CEO, who with his bald head and
goatee looks like one of the supporting players on the network's
hit ``WWF Smackdown!''
</P>
<P>
   And UPN's strategy has worked like a pile driver. Last season,
the little network was on life support, a laughingstock that didn't
know what it was doing. Now, thanks mainly to adding the World
Wrestling Federation on Thursdays, its ratings are up 36 percent
across the board over last season, at a time when the other five
broadcast networks are all declining in viewership.
</P>
<P>
   UPN still doesn't get much respect, but it gets ad buyers'
attention now, so that's an improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The network is going even further in the Tour de Testosterone.
At 8 tonight, it debuts ``I Dare You! The Ultimate Challenge,'' an
hour of stuntmen and women doing stuff that looks much more
dangerous than it is. One will land an airplane into the back of a
moving truck, another will ski across a lake of fire, and there's
something called the ``Limo of Death.'' Evel Knievel himself will
provide commentary, but the real brains _ if that's the right word
_ behind ``I Dare You!'' is Bruce Nash, producer of such specials
as ``When Good Pets Go Bad'' for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   While UPN promotes the show as if someone might die onscreen in
the next five minutes, Nash says the stunts are carefully planned.
``We want to make sure that it looks death-defying, but that these
daredevils are going to be safe,'' says Nash.
</P>
<P>
   Not content with the ``Limo of Death,'' UPN gets into the
monster truck smash-up business in February sweeps with a special
called ``Monster Trux CQ 2000,'' which could become a series if it
does well. UPN is figuring out characters and stories for the truck
drivers like the WWF does for its wrestlers, the better to whip
folks into a rooting frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   As UPN follows its game plan of male-mania, here are some other
shows in the pipeline:
</P>
<P>
   _ On Feb. 9, WWF's The Rock guest stars on ``Star Trek:
Voyager'' as an alien who has a gladiator battle with Seven of Nine
(Jeri Ryan).
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Hip-Hop Bounty Hunters'' is a new show in development for
fall. ``I think the title of that one says it all,'' laughs Tom
Nunan CQ, president of UPN Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I Spike,'' a series about female spies masquerading as a
professional beach volleyball team. (''Charlie's Angels'' with less
wardrobe overhead, perhaps.)
</P>
<P>
   Blaming the 'do
</P>
<P>
   The WB is instituting a new rule: No more haircuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is cutting their hair again on our network,'' says
Susanne Daniels, president of WB Entertainment, only half in jest,
still reeling from the uproar last fall when ``Felicity'' star Keri
Russell reduced her signature long locks to a cap of tight curls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think it affected the show on some level? Yes,'' says
Daniels. ``It lost some distinctiveness somehow.'' Daniels said the
WB was overwhelmed with negative e-mail from fans when Russell
unveiled her new 'do, which was ordered up by show creator J.J.
Abrams.
</P>
<P>
   Russell was the golden girl of television when ``Felicity''
debuted in 1998, but the WB moved the show to Sunday last fall and
its ratings have plummeted. Apart from the haircut, Daniels said
``the show had a rocky start creatively this past fall.'' It's been
in reruns for several weeks, but comes back at 8 p.m. Sunday with
an offbeat black-and-white episode that's a homage to ``The
Twilight Zone.'' As for rumors that ``Felicity'' might be in danger
of cancellation, Jamie Kellner, CEO of the WB, says simply, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   And Russell is growing her hair back out.

 &HT;    Losing to Jags can be hazardous to health
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Not winning against the Jacksonville
Jaguars has not been a risky endeavor lately. Of the 10 coaches
that lost to the Jags this season, nearly a third left their jobs
by the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Jimmy Johnson was the last casualty, retiring one day
after Saturday's historic 62-7 slamming. Though Johnson had been
slowly sliding out the door in Miami, Jacksonville coach Tom
Coughlin sounded genuinely sorry his team provided the last straw.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does it his way,'' Coughlin said of Johnson. ``His formula
is solid. It's been a privilege to coach against him. I have high
regard for his coaching success and the things that he's done. He
will be an individual and a personality that will be missed in our
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The other two coaches to lose to Jacksonville and later exit
were New Orleans' Mike Ditka, a 41-23 loser Nov. 21, and the New
York Jets' Bill Parcells, a 16-6 loser Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
   A healthy Taylor
</P>
<P>
   Fred Taylor is healthy. It was best evidenced by his 90-yard
touchdown run and 39-yard touchdown reception against the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Both showed that Taylor can present major problems for
Tennessee. And Taylor said he isn't 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I felt better in the Cincy game,'' Taylor said. ``I
felt I was quick in the Cincy game and I started to feel like it
was coming back. Against Miami, it was one long run, a couple stops
here and there, another two or three bursts here and there, then
that reception. I didn't feel overly quick _ not as quick as I felt
in the Cincy game _ but I felt good.''
</P>
<P>
   It showed.
</P>
<P>
   He dodged and outran defenders on the 90-yard play. And he broke
tackles on the scoring pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It demonstrated not only his elusiveness, but his acceleration
and what a dangerous threat he is once he's in that secondary,''
said Coughlin. ``He has presence about him. He sees people most of
us might not see.''
</P>
<P>
   A humbling fact
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin doesn't think he team will get a big head about its
55-point victory against the Dolphins. Tennessee defeated
Jacksonville 20-19 in Jacksonville and 41-14 in Tennessee three
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin said that should be enough motivation for his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will make us very humble,'' Coughlin said of the losses
to the Titans. Despite those two losses and despite the loss of
left tackle Tony Boselli to a knee injury, the Jaguars are favored
by a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Etc. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Jags and Tennessee are 5-5 all-time in head-to-head
competition, counting the Titans' previous life as the Houston
Oilers. Both teams are 4-1 against each other at home. . . . The
Oilers delivered the Titans' first loss in a 10-3 inaugural game at
Alltel Stadium in the 1995 opener. . . . Jacksonville later won its
first game in franchise history 17-16 in the rematch that season. .
. . The Jaguars had Monday off. Though coaches began game-plan
sessions Sunday that should be short work; the teams last played
Dec. 26 the players begin a four-day work week today. ``We won't
overdo it on the field,'' Coughlin said, ``but we'll spend four
solid days in study and preparation.''

AS FOE OF CHRISTIAN RIGHT, NEW HEAD OF LIBERAL LOBBY RELISHES THE
FIGHT

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ralph Neas is no stranger to a tough fight.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man, Neas confronted death when he contracted
Guillain-Barre Syndrome, a neurological disorder that left him
paralyzed from the neck down for several months. Neas later faced
some initial skepticism when, as a white Republican, he was
selected to head the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, where
he worked for 14 years. More recently, he and his wife struggled to
have children; Neas, 53, became a first-time father this past
September.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Neas has a new job and what would appear to be another
series of fights on the horizon. As president of People For The
American Way, a liberal-minded civil liberties group, Neas expects
to do battle with the religious right on a host of issues this
year, ranging from the use of school vouchers to the posting of the
Ten Commandments in public buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only so many times in a lifetime where you can be on
the front lines of history and make a difference,'' Neas said,
recalling the advice of a friend when he began his career as a
civil rights activist. ``Thisis another one of those moments where
the battle lines could be drawn in a similar manner.''
</P>
<P>
   With the presidency and Congress up for grabs, Neas _ who left
the Republican party and registered as a Democrat in 1995 because
of what he saw as the ``extreme'' nature of the new GOP leadership
_ views 2000 as a watershed year in the political world. Neas
believes the next president will also have the opportunity to
appoint as many as four new Supreme Court justices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that we've worked for, everything that we've fought
for is at risk if the right takes over the three branches of
government,'' Neas said.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1980 by television producer Norman Lear, People For
The American Way was designed as a counterbalance to the rising
influence of religious right groups like Jerry Falwell's Moral
Majority. The group's ties to Hollywood remain strong.
</P>
<P>
   David Altschul, vice chairman and general counsel for Warner
Bros. Records in Los Angeles and chairman of People For The
American Way, was on the search committee that picked Neas to head
the group this past fall. Altschul said that Neas, who began his
job this month, was selected because the organization believes he
can elevate its profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is somebody who is well-respected and well-known in the
political world of Washington and the advocacy world of
Washington,'' Altschul said. ``That's important. Nobody needs to
become accustomed to the world of Ralph.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Neas has been at the forefront of some of the biggest
civil rights battles in modern-day Washington. He led the coalition
that opposed the 1987 nomination of conservative jurist Robert Bork
to the Supreme Court, a fight that he fondly recalls as ``one of
the most important, historic events of the last 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have a dimmer view of that particular battle.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who sits on the Judiciary Committee
and voted against Bork's nomination, criticized the high-profile
campaigns that surrounded the nomination. ``Well, I was not happy
to see the _ let's see if can put this diplomatically _ public
relations battles that went on between those who favored him and
those who opposed him,'' Specter said. ``It was
counterproductive.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet Parshall, spokeswoman for the conservative Family Research
Council, said she doesn't know Neas, but she's quite familiar with
his new employer, saying People For The ``UnAmerican'' Way _ as she
preferred to call it _ wants to drive religion out of the public
square.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to make sure America only leans left and only
walks their way,'' Parshall said. ``And that is not the American
way.''
</P>
<P>
   On one point, there is little disagreement. Neas is a dogged and
effective champion for his causes. He presided over the Leadership
Conference on Civil Rights during the Reagan/Bush years, a time
when many conservatives sought to scale back government programs
and laws that helped minorities. Still, civil rights advocates
succeeded in pushing through such measures as the Americans with
Disabilities Act in 1990 and the 1982 Voting Rights Extension Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ralph just out-hustles the competition,'' said Wade Henderson,
Neas' successor at the Leadership Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Clint Bollick, litigation director for the conservative
Institute for Justice in Washington, has crossed paths and swords
often with Neas over the years. He describes Neas as ``profoundly
left-wing'' and a disciple of ``social engineering,'' but he also
calls Neas a worthy adversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was choosing up sides without regard to ideology, I would
certainly choose Ralph,'' Bollick said. ``He is tenacious.''
</P>
<P>
   But Neas isn't always victorious. In 1998, he tried to unseat a
popular Republican congresswoman in suburban Maryland, where he
lives, but was soundly defeated. He considered another run this
year before his wife gave birth to their daughter, Maria.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Neas said he is eager to take on the conservative
Christian movement, describing it as a threat to civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certainly no question that People For The American Way
will continue to take on the Pat Robertsons and the James Dobsons
and the Gary Bauers and the Ralph Reeds and the Pat Buchanans and
those who we think are the leaders of the radical religious
right,'' Neas said. ``Because they continue to be a threat to First
Amendment values, they continue to be a threat to equal opportunity
issues.''

   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ As soon as their part in the AFC
Championship Game scenario had been established Saturday, the
Jacksonville Jaguars already were pondering their preferred path
toward Super Bowl XXXIV in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars had not yet showered from their 62-7 manhandling of
the Miami Dolphins and they were not so quietly rooting for an
appearance from the team that owned them.
</P>
<P>
   What better than to be positioned one win from the Super Bowl?
Easy. An assignment at home against the team that had beaten them
twice during the regular season, the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   When Tennessee beat the Colts 19-16 Sunday, the Jags' mission
became clear.
</P>
<P>
   Is it necessarily a good thing for Jacksonville that the Titans
survived for a third meeting? According to history, maybe not. Of
the 32 occasions when teams have played three times in a season, 18
times the team with the 2-0 record has swept the third. In 14 of
the third meetings, the previously handled team has prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jags never hid from the challenge, and now they have the
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tennessee, for obvious reasons,'' said Jacksonville tackle Ben
Coleman,'' is the team we wanted to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Tennessee, the Jags had compiled a perfect season. With
a second meeting a 41-14 disaster in Nashville in Week 15, the Jags
want to prove to everyone in the NFL that it does not reflect
accurately on their talent. Perhaps the same, as it turns out, that
beating Miami 62-7 isn't particularly meaningful, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have great memories of the last time we played
them,'' said Jags coach Tom Coughlin of the Titans. ``We think the
last game was an aberration. But our players will be humbled
because of that game. . . There's no way around it, though. It
happened. We don't spend a lot of time on it, but we'll throw it
out there again and bring things back to exactly where they were.
That will make us very humble.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially when coupled with the Jags' qualification game to the
NFL's Final Four, the Miami mess that pushed the hastily-retired
Jimmy Johnson from missed tackles to fishing tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee won the first meeting with Jacksonville, 20-19, at
Alltel Stadium, playing without receiver Fred Taylor and losing
four turnovers. In the second loss the Jags' lost offensive tackle
Tony Boselli for the playoffs and allowed quarterback Mark Brunell,
who was intercepted on his first series, to injure his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   After that loss, a pledge by receiver Jimmy Smith seemed to gain
significance as he said, ``We've got some soul-searching to do.
Yes, it's a wake-up call.''
</P>
<P>
   Brunell's status Sunday is important. He was sacked four times
in the 41-14 loss to Tennessee last month. Playing less than a half
last Saturday with braces on both knees, Brunell should be back to
his full mobility for the final installment against the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguar defense fell apart in Nashville the last time,
allowing Titans quarterback Steve McNair to pass for 291 yards and
five touchdowns and yielding a 102-yard game to running back Eddie
George.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do a better job defensively than we did the last
time,'' Coughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars were off Monday and will return to practice today.

   MIDEAST-TALKS (Washington) _ In a major setback for the
Israeli-Syrian peace talks, the Clinton administration announced
Monday that the resumption of the negotiations had been delayed
indefinitely from their scheduled start on Wednesday. The
administration was careful not to blame either side, saying in a
deliberately worded statement by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright that ``their approaches to the next round differ, and as a
result, there is going to be a delay.'' By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Mozdok, Russia) _ The Russian military renewed
its assault on Chechnya's capital Monday as the Kremlin sought to
bring its siege of the city to a speedy and decisive end.
Explaining the new offensive, Lt. Gen. Gennady Troshev, the deputy
commander of Russian troops in the Northern Caucasus region, said
there would soon be ``radical changes'' in the situation in Grozny.
Troshev did not say what the changes would be. But they seem to
involve a sharp escalation in Russian artillery barrages and air
strikes. By Michael R. Gordon. (With map.)
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-INSPECTIONS (United Nations) _ Rolf Ekeus, the Swedish arms
control expert who uncovered and destroyed large quantities of
Iraqi weapons after the 1991 war in the Persian Gulf, was called
back Monday by Secretary-General Kofi Annan to lead a new
commission created to finish the job more than a year after
monitoring broke down. But Annan did not have the customary
Security Council consensus in making the appointment, nearly 12
hours after a deadline for the nomination had passed. By Barbara
Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-U.S.-BORDER (Agua Prieta, Mexico) _ Tens of thousands of
undocumented Mexicans have crossed into the United States since the
New Year's holidays, provoking detentions on an industrial-strength
scale. This gritty town in the Sonora desert across from Douglas,
Ariz., has been the busiest staging area of the 2,000-mile border.

   LIFESTYLE-MEDICINE (Undated) _ Until recently, doctors who
specialized in so-called lifestyle medicine _ elective and largely
cosmetic procedures _ were limited to rarefied corners of the
medical profession. But facing declining revenues because of
reimbursement cuts by managed care companies, thousands of doctors
in New York and across the country are turning to cosmetic medicine
to keep their practices lucrative. By Jennifer Steinhauer. (With

</P>
<P>
   CLASSIC-BOOKS-EDUC (Chicago) _ A new program at Wilbur Wright
College, a community college on this city's North Side that caters
primarily to high school graduates considered not ready for
four-year institutions, allows students to earn a special minor or
certificate by taking a concentration of courses on the so-called
great books of the Western canon. What is different is that at
Wright and other institutions, most of them ranked in the middle to
lower end of the national academic pack, are taking steps to
underline such classes and to emphasize that they are critical to a
liberal arts education. By Jacques Steinberg. (With photo.)

   SAN ANTONIO _ As the nation observed the birthday of the Rev.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the American Library Association
announced Monday that two of the most prestigious prizes for
children's literature, the Newbery Medal and the Coretta Scott King
Author Award for excellence by African-American writers, were both
going to ``Bud, Not Buddy,'' by Christopher Paul Curtis
(Delacorte). The novel, set during the Depression, is about a
10-year-old orphan who runs away from yet another foster home in
Flint, Mich., in search of a legendary band leader in Grand Rapids
who he thinks might be his father.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis' first novel, ``The Watsons Go to Birmingham _ 1963,''
was a Newbery Honor Book in 1996. But this is the first time since
1976 that an African-American writer has won the Newbery Medal, and
the announcement was greeted with enthusiasm by the librarians and
publishers at the association's midwinter meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Caldecott Medal for illustration went to ``Joseph Had a
Little Overcoat,'' written and illustrated by Simms Taback
(Viking). Based on a Yiddish folk tale, it tells how a resourceful
tailor transforms his worn-out overcot into smaller and smaller
garments. The ebullient illustrations are in watercolor, gouache,
pencil, ink and collage. Taback's retelling of ``There Was an Old
Lady Who Swallowed a Fly'' was an Honor Book in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The first Michael L. Printz Award for excellence in literature
for young adults (a new award named for a librarian from Topeka,
Kan.) also went to a black writer, Walter Dean Myers, for
``Monster'' (HarperCollins). It was also chosen as a King Honor
Book.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Honor Books, or secondary awards in the prizes
administered by committees of the Library Association, is at the
discretion of the jury for each prize.
</P>
<P>
   This year there were three Newbery Honor Books: ``Getting Near
to Baby'' by Audry Couloumbis (Putnam's), ``25 Fairmount Avenue''
by Tomie dePaola (Putnam's) and ``Our Only May Amelia'' by Jennifer
L. Holm (HarperCollins).
</P>
<P>
   There were four Caldecott Honor Books: ``Sector 7,'' illustrated
and written by David Weisner (Clarion); ``The Ugly Duckling,''
adapted and illustrated by Jerry Pinkney (Morrow); ``When Sophie
Gets Angry _ Really, Really Angry,'' illustrated and written by
Molly Bang (Scholastic); and ``A Child's Calendar,'' illustrated by
Trina Schart Hyman and written by John Updike (Holiday).
</P>
<P>
   There were three King Author Honor Books: ``Francie'' by Karen
English (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux); ``Black Hand, White Sails: The
Story of African-American Whalers'' by Patricia C. and Frederick L.
McKissack (Scholastic), and ``Monster.''
</P>
<P>
   There were also two King Honor Books for illustration: ``My Rows
and Piles of Coins,'' illustrated by E.B. Lewis and written by
Tolowa M. Mollel (Clarion), and ``Black Cat,'' illustrated and
written by Christopher Myers (Scholastic). Myers also illustrated
his father's prize-winning ``Monster.''

A COUPLE DONATES 1,000 WORKS OF MODERN ART TO 29 MUSEUMS

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Norton, the California software entrepreneur, and his
wife, Eileen, have announced that they are donating nearly 1,000
works by more than 450 artists to 29 institutions. Most of the
works are from the 1990s. In sheer numbers, it is one of the
largest gifts of contemporary art by a private donor.
</P>
<P>
   Norton, who estimated the total value of the works at more than
$3 million, said gifts would go to the Tate Gallery in London and a
variety of institutions in the United States, ranging from the
Museum of Modern Art (which is to receive nearly two dozen works)
and the Whitney Museum of American Art in Manhattan to small and
medium-size museums and college art galleries across the country,
though predominantly in the West.
</P>
<P>
   He said that those museums had demonstrated what Norton, 56,
called a ``spunky'' commitment to new art. They include the Johnson
Community College Gallery of Art in Overland Park, Kan.; the Bard
Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College in
Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y.; and the Kemper Museum of Contemporary
Art in Kansas City. Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The list also includes a museum in Manhattan that has not yet
opened, the first in the United States to be devoted to sex.
Norton's gift is the first donation of art to the for-profit
museum, which is planned for Fifth Avenue and 27th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,000 works are generally minor but are nonetheless precious
to many of the smaller institutions, some of which are just
beginning to assemble collections. The better-known art ranges from
set-up photographs by Cindy Sherman to the painter John Currin's
parodic pornography to Joel-Peter Witkin's surreal and often
alarming photographs, the sort of art that can be difficult for
small museums to raise money to buy.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year-old Kemper Museum will receive 15 works by artists
including the photographer Nan Goldin. Dan Keegan, the museum's
director, described it as ``the first we've ever received of fresh
stuff,'' meaning new art. ``The gift fills large holes,'' he said.
No good deed is taken at face value in the art world, and there was
grumbling among rival collectors that the donation was a way for
Norton to dump unwanted art from his collection in exchange for
favorable publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can spin anything in any uncomplimentary way or vice
versa,'' Norton responded. ``We're focusing our collection, and you
can use other words, flattering or otherwise, for focusing, if
you'd like.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the whole point of having rich people wandering around
among us? To engage in certain frivolous mischief that the public
benefits from enormously,'' he continued. The donation represents
some public good and some public amusement.''
</P>
<P>
   Norton is not the only prominent collector of new art to receive
conspicuous attention lately. Charles Saatchi, the Briton whose
``Sensation'' exhibition just closed at the Brooklyn Museum of Art,
is in many ways the opposite of Norton, with different tastes in
art and different political views, although both men share a
reputation in art circles for cunning and combativeness.
</P>
<P>
   Their paths have crossed in the past, when they fought in court
over the ownership of a painting, ``The Wizard'' by Currin. Norton
prevailed in that case, and now that picture is part of the
donationto the Tate.
</P>
<P>
   Norton said that the timing of his announcement, just at the
closing of ``Sensation,'' was coincidental. ``The thought didn't
even cross my mind,'' he said. ``If people now see Saatchi
negatively _ and I'm not characterizing him that way, the criticism
seems unfair to me _ then our making this gift is at least an
example of a different kind of public behavior by a collector. It's
a token of what a lot of other people are doing more quietly.''
</P>
<P>
   One consequence of the culture wars of the last decade,
including the tumult over ``Sensation,'' in which a controversial
work prompted Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to try to cut off the
museum's city financing, seems to have been to increase skepticism
toward new art, particularly the abrasive and confrontational works
that Norton sometimes embraces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to be interested in alternative communities, gay and
lesbian artists, different ethnicities, gender issues,'' Norton
said of his and his wife's collecting. ``We began, like everyone
else, buying sporadically. Then gradually we figured out what we
were doing. Our strengths are in Hispanic and African-American art.
I'm uninterested in medium per se, but a lot of the art also turns
out to be photo-based because a lot of contemporary art,
particularly contemporary art with social content, is
photo-based.''
</P>
<P>
   Some works to be given away (prints, generally) are by
20th-century Modernists like Miro, Munch, Jean Rouault and Jean
Tinguely. With exceptions like Ms. Sherman, Chuck Close, Robert
Rauschenberg and Ed Ruscha, few of the contemporary artists in the
donation are well known. A handful _ including Currin, Elizabeth
Peyton, Wolfgang Tillmans and Nari Ward _ are what might be called
prominent emerging artists, but most of them are young,
lesser-known or unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Twice recently Norton has made attention-grabbing gifts. He gave
$600,000 to the Signature Theater Co. in Manhattan in September,
and earlier last year he paid more than $150,000 at a Sotheby's
auction for the private letters that the novelist J.D. Salinger had
sent to Joyce Maynard. Norton returned the letters to Salinger. (He
still has not heard from Salinger, he said.)
</P>
<P>
   Brought up in Seattle and educated at Reed College, Norton now
splits his time between Santa Monica, Calif., and Manhattan. He
went into business for himself as a computer programmer in 1981
after IBM introduced its first personal computers, and he invented
programs like UnErase, to recover deleted files, and the Norton
anti-virus software, before selling his company to Symantec Corp.
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife began collecting art in the early '80s. Their
collection outgrew several homes, offices and a warehouse. When the
Nortons acquired the collection of nearly 800 works that belonged
to Karen and Clyde Beswick in 1998, ``that pushed us to do
something,'' Norton said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Solomon, an art consultant to Norton, and Susan Cahan, the
senior curator and director of arts programs for the Norton
Foundation, spent the next two years paring down the couple's
holdings by assembling the donation, which constitutes 40 percent
of the couple's collection. The recipients were winnowed from
several hundred possibilities to the final 29, including 10 in
California and 4 more elsewhere in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Norton said that because he was a trustee of the Museum of
Modern Art, he gave that museum first crack at the art, ``as a
matter of courtesy,'' and he was ``amazed'' that the Modern ended
up selecting 21 works.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the whole, it is true, the works we're giving away are not
major works,'' Norton said. ``And that's why we didn't presume that
any of the major museums would be interested.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the works that the Modern requested can be said to be
crucial to that museum, although they do allow for a hedging of
bets against shifting tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They fill gaps, basically, with young artists whom we didn't
already own,'' said Glenn Lowry, the Modern's director. ``This is
the kind of donation that creates breadth in a contemporary
collection. And what matters with new art is having breadth for the
long term, as the reputations of artists shake out. It ensures that
the collection has legs to grow on.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The gifts will have a far greater impact on smaller museums with
more limited budgets and modest collections.
</P>
<P>
   These institutions generally were offered packages that were put
together by Solomon and Ms. Cahan according to themes like ``the
unnatural'' and ``conceptual sculpture.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kemper in Kansas City got a package called
``pleasure/pain.'' Dana Self, the Kemper's curator, applied to the
Norton Foundation more than a year ago when she heard that the
couple might be giving art away. Solomon spent a day at the Kemper
Museum and then decided to donate, a bronze sculpture of a hand and
forearm with a razor blade in the wrist by Terry Allen and a
Matthias Herrmann close-up photograph of a tongue licking lips, in
addition to the photograph by Ms. Goldin.
</P>
<P>
   The Kemper, typical of the sort of institution that Norton is
supporting through the gift, presents roughly a dozen exhibitions a
year, mostly of new art. It has no acquisitions budget, and until
now its wholly 20th-century collection, from its founder, R. Crosby
Kemper, included hardly any work of the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gift is significant to our community as an acknowledgment
by the Nortons that we're doing a good job,'' Ms. Self said. ``It
helps other people understand what we need. Naturally we're
overjoyed.'' &QL;

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: WE HAPPY MANY, PLAYING FAST AND LOOSE WITH
HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A recent article in The New York Times stated that the movie
``The Hurricane,'' which is about the reversal of the boxer
Hurricane Carter's unjust conviction for three murders committed in
1966, mixed fact with fiction for the sake of better drama. That is
not much of a surprise: Rare is the movie about history that does
not do the same. The justification, not yet put forward about ``The
Hurricane'' but no doubt soon to be offered, is that a work of art
cannot be tied down to the dross of mere fact as it strives for the
uncluttered essence of the truth.
</P>
<P>
   There is a corollary to that justification. Not only have all
artists manipulated history to forge theater and cinema, the
greatest of them all, Shakespeare, did too. And if Shakespeare
allowed himself to invent scenes that never happened and to put
words into the mouths of historical figures who never said them
(Does anybody think that Henry V really proclaimed, ``We happy few,
we band of brothers'' at the Battle of Agincourt?), then isn't it
more or less the same when filmmakers do those things today?
</P>
<P>
   A good question, one for which there is no easy answer. And yet
it troubles the mind, especially if you believe as I do that at a
time when fact and fiction are ever more blurred in film and on
television, there ought to be something sacred about the historical
truth.
</P>
<P>
   But what I have come to see as the Shakespeare defense _ that a
higher truth resides, as it were, above the facts _ is, at least at
first glance, a powerful one. No less an authority than the critic
Harold Bloom wrote in his last book (``Shakespeare: The Invention
of the Human'') that Shakespeare's Richard III, unfairly depicted
as an evil genius who had his nephews murdered in the Tower of
London, was a reflection of the Tudor propaganda of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Is there no ethical difference between the Shakespeare of
Richard III and, say, the Oliver Stone of ``J.F.K.'' and ``Nixon''
or the makers of ``The Hurricane''?
</P>
<P>
   There are important differences, some involving quality and
others practicality. They are not easy to specify because they have
less to do with the reimagining of history than with whether
history is reimagined in a way that respects the facts. The basic
difference is that Shakespeare's history was complex and ambiguous,
while most recent movie history is morally one-dimensional,
bite-size and therefore easy to swallow. At least three points can
be made in this regard: one, the nature of Shakespeare as a
historian; two, propaganda as opposed to art; three, the enormous
technical and public relations power enjoyed by moviemakers that
was unavailable to playwrights of Shakespeare's time.
</P>
<P>
   First: Shakespeare was a far better historian and a more serious
one than most of the history-minded moviemakers of today. He took
far fewer liberties with real events and the meanings of those
events than the movies do. This is why the Shakespeare defense
relies so much on the example of Richard III, which, as James
Shapiro, a Shakespearean scholar at Columbia University, put it in
a recent conversation, represents the closest Shakespeare ever came
in the history plays to following a party line; in essence, to
being politically correct in an Elizabethan context.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that probably distinguishes how Shakespeare dealt
with history is how many historical sources he read,'' Shapiro
said. When he wrote, say, ``Richard III,'' he was writing in the
context of Tudor myth, which saw Richard as evil incarnate (the
first Tudor, Henry VII, was his killer). But he was also dealing
with a range of classical sources like Plutarch, Pliny and Livy as
well as chroniclers closer to Shakespeare's own time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare did not see writing history as a way of writing
polemic,'' Shapiro said. ``He was interested in the wellsprings of
the political process and the historical process. He was most
interested in seeing how history works, not in using it as a stick
to hit someone with or to reverse historical wrongs.''
</P>
<P>
   That raises point No. 2. Many movies about historical events
today are closer to propaganda, to a kind of agitprop, than to
history. A recent example of this is Tim Robbins' ``Cradle Will
Rock,'' a movie about the anti-Communist hysteria in Depression-era
America that led the federal government to ban the performance of a
leftist play.
</P>
<P>
   The central event depicted in Robbins' film _ the banning of a
play sponsored by the tax-financed Federal Theater Project _ did
take place, largely because the play, by Marc Blitzstein, was seen
as Communist-inspired. But Robbins uses that central truth to spin
a kind of reductive Manichean morality tale that makes a shambles
of history.
</P>
<P>
   The only characters in Robbins' movie worried that Communists
were indeed working to gain influence in cultural circles are
pro-fascist, racist, sexually repressed misfits. A congressman who
investigates the Federal Theater Project is so blithely imbecilic
that he doesn't know who Shakespeare was. In one scene, William
Randolph Hearst (dressed in red clerical robes for a costume party)
and the president of U.S. Steel (dressed as Louis XIV) talk about
how they are going to control the culture by paying for it.
Shakespeare didn't do things like that.
</P>
<P>
   The third point could be put this way: If, say, Stone's
``J.F.K.'' had been played on a bare stage without electrical
lights or microphones and with the characters speaking in iambic
pentameter, the effect of historical verisimilitude would have been
considerably reduced. Shakespeare did not strive to convey an
impression that what his audiences were seeing is what actually or
literally transpired in history. The contract that he made with his
viewers was that they were witnessing an interpretation of history,
not an exact reproduction of events.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most history movies, by contrast, not only reduce history to a
simple situation but also strive to give the impression that they
are reconstructing what really happened. Armies of publicity agents
with multimillion-dollar budgets are then dispatched to convince
the public that this is the case. The publicity for ``The
Hurricane'' boldly states that the movie tells ``a true story.''
When Stone's ``J.F.K.'' was released, Warner Brothers distributed
thousands of study kits to high schools across the nation so that
teachers might use the movie as a starting point for learning about
the Kennedy assassination.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, in interviews and in debates, Stone presented his
``J.F.K.'' as just one man's point of view, among others. But the
facts of the contemporary world ensured that one man had an
audience of perhaps 50 million and that his style of filmmaking,
involving a rapid-fire mixing of fictional and documentary clips,
would convey a vastly more powerful impression of reality than
anything Shakespeare could have put on his modest stage.
</P>
<P>
   The funny thing is that Shakespeare's history itself is often
tampered with on the stage and in movies, usually to reduce the
plays' complexity. In his movie role as Henry V during World War
II, Laurence Olivier, reportedly at the behest of Winston
Churchill, deleted Shakespeare's references to treason committed by
English lords. A half-century later, when Kenneth Branagh filmed a
new version of the same play, he altered an important sequence
involving Henry's order to kill French prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   In Branagh's version, brilliant despite this change, Henry gives
the order after he comes upon an English boy killed by the enemy.
In the original Shakespeare, the order comes before. The lesson
would appear to be that Shakespeare in the original was more
morally complex than is deemed appropriate. Shakespeare's Henry was
possessed of a kind of savage chauvinism that violates one's sense
of a well-ordered moral world.
</P>
<P>
   A similar sort of simplification seems to have been at work in
one of the historical falsifications introduced into the Hurricane
Carter story. Missing in ``The Hurricane'' is the fact that before
his clearly unjust conviction for murder, Carter spent four years
in prison for committing three muggings. The movie version Carter
is a model citizen, a man who, were it not for a racist system that
victimized him (symbolized by a vicious detective), would have been
above suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare's history yields odors; it is not tidy and
stench-free. Shakespeare approached history with depth and
integrity and, rather than sanitize it, he let his audiences stub
their minds against them.
</P>
<P>
   This is hardly the history practiced by filmmakers today, who
nonetheless claim Shakespeare as a member of the same club,
appealing to his authority to explain away their much less
interesting tampering with the facts.
</P>

FIRST UP ON JOHNSON'S AGENDA: THE BELICHICK MATTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   National Football League owners are expected to formally approve
Robert ``Woody'' Johnson as the new owner of the New York Jets
Tuesday at league meetings at the Waldorf Astoria in New York.
Johnson is scheduled to meet with the media at noon, but he is not
expected to address the Bill Belichick issue.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Johnson should expedite the Belichick matter,
however. NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue is expected to ask Johnson
what direction he wants to go regarding Belichick, whom the
Patriots are interested in as coach/general manager. If Johnson
wants to pursue compensation, Tagliabue will relay his wishes to
Patriots owner Robert Kraft. If the sides can't reach an agreement,
Tagliabue will be forced to make a decision on last week's
grievance hearing in which Belichick claimed he was no longer
contractually bound to the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Once Tagliabue has relayed the Jets' wishes to Kraft, he can
mediate a negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots turn from Belichick, they have one fewer
candidate to consider. St. Louis Rams offensive coordinator Mike
Martz agreed to a two-year contract extension with the team Monday.
Martz also was promised the head coaching job when Dick Vermeil
retires.
</P>
<P>
   Reports that Bill Parcells has already turned down big money to
return as coach of the Jets are premature. Parcells has spent no
more than five minutes with Johnson and did not meet with him last
Friday as had been reported.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells is supposed to meet with Johnson Tuesday. If Parcells
sticks to his guns, he will tell Johnson he's not coaching but
likely will recommend assistant coach Al Groh for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick's legal team, led by Jeffrey Kessler, has been trying
to free Belichick from his contract without compensation,
threatening antitrust suits against the league and trying to show
that the Jets elevated Belichick only to head coach and not
director of football operations after Parcells stepped aside. The
Jets claim they did elevate Belichick to the higher title.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick has been spending time with his family over the past
few days and attending some of his children's sporting events. If
he winds up in New England, he likely will replace Bobby Grier,
perhaps with one of his allies _ Baltimore's Phil Savage or New
York's Scott Pioli.

COMMISSION DISPUTES THAT BERTELSMANN OPPOSED NAZIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year after Bertelsmann, the German media conglomerate,
appointed an independent group of scholars to examine its disputed
history during the Nazi era, the commission issued a preliminary
report Monday that took issue with corporate lore that the Nazis
closed the publishing company because of its political opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The four-member commission's tentative conclusion was that
Bertelsmann was closed simply because its product was not
considered critically ``important for the war'' effort. The group
also found that one of the early family leaders of the company,
Heinrich Mohn, belonged to a circle of ``sponsoring members of the
SS'' and that the small company rose remarkably to become the
dominant publisher of reading material for German soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, a mix of German and American scholars, indicated
that little research had been done on what they called the ``SS
sponsors circle.'' But it said that the organization was made up of
members who took no oath of allegiance to Hitler, were not required
to serve on active duty in a unit and were not subject to the SS's
physical and racial standards. The commission said it appeared
their primary duty was to contribute money to the SS every month.
</P>
<P>
   Mohn's links to the SS came to light in 1998 with critical
articles about Bertelsmann's corporate history in the Swiss
magazine Die Weltwoche and in the Nation in the United States.
After those articles, Bertelsmann's new chief executive, Thomas
Middelhoff, announced that the company would create an independent
commission to study its history.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann is the third-largest media conglomerate in the world
with more than 600 far-flung companies and nearly 60,000 employees
in more than 50 countries. The company, based in Guetersloh, owns
the largest trade publisher in the United States, Random House, the
record company BMG Entertainment and Gruner Jahr, which publishes
magazines like McCall's and Family Circle.
</P>
<P>
   With the release of the commission's preliminary findings at a
news conference at the University of Munich, Middelhoff also issued
a brief statement about the commission's finding about the reason
Bertelsmann was closed in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret that this fact was unknown to us before and that our
corporate history has in part been misrepresented as a result,'' he
said. Previously Middelhoff had acknowledged that during the Nazi
era ``there were clearly some titles published by Bertelsmann which
were not consistent with our values.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinrich Mohn was the fourth generation in his family to lead
Bertelsmann, but it was his son, Reinhard, who took over the
company in 1947 and ultimately set the tone for the expansion and
contemporary philosophy of Bertelsmann, which prides itself on a
decentralized system that allows its units to operate relatively
independently.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which was led by Saul Friedlander, a historian
from the University of California at Los Angeles, also examined
Bertelsmann's efforts to publish Wehrmacht-edition propaganda books
for German troops during World War II. All those books had to be
produced under the strict supervision of the Propaganda Ministry
and included thrillers, home-and-hearth novels and tales of war
experiences on the front.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann's involvement in this form of publishing had been
only sketchily known, the commission said. It noted Monday that
Bertelsmann's earnings increased by a factor of 11 in just a few
years, from 284,191 marks in 1938 to 3,259,730 marks in 1941. The
company probably manufactured and delivered more than a quarter of
about 75 million copies of Wehrmacht-edition books, the commission
said. ``This leading role on the part of a relatively small and
politically less than prominent firm in the war economy's
officially supervised book market appears remarkable,'' it noted in
its report. ``No other press so extensively furnished the German
soldiers with reading matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission will continue through the next year to study
questions left unresolved by its early findings. For example, it
intends to study more fully the motivations of Heinrich Mohn, who
after the war explained that ``on occasion in earlier years'' he
had contributed small sums to the Nazi Party ``in order to be left
alone.'' The total amount of his donations is unclear, although the
commission found evidence that he contributed to the Adolf Hitler
Charity fund, the Nazi Winter Charity and the German Red Cross. He
also gave money to Nazi youth organizations like the Flyers' Group
of Hitler Youth.

MUSIC INDUSTRY EXPECTS MERGER TO ACCELERATE CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For the music industry, the merger of America
Online and Time Warner has struck a chord. It promises to hasten
the coming of the day when music is distributed digitally through
the Internet rather than through record stores.
</P>
<P>
   But that chord doesn't sound the death knell of record stores
just yet. Many obstacles must be overcome before consumers
routinely download music instead of buying compact discs. And there
is a limit to how much one company _ even one as potentially
powerful as AOL Time Warner _ can influence the evolution of
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The promise, of course, comes from the combination of AOL, the
world's largest Internet service provider, with Time Warner's
record company, one of the five giants that dominate the music
business. The merged company is expected to push music online more
aggressively than record companies alone have been doing. And AOL's
expertise in making the Internet easy to use could help make
Internet music downloading less daunting for novices.
</P>
<P>
   ``In combination we think we can help to set the agenda for the
industry,'' said Ted Leonsis, president of the AOL Interactive
Properties Group.
</P>
<P>
   Still, owning both content and distribution does not necessarily
give a company the ability to set an industry agenda. Sony bought a
movie studio after the defeat it suffered in the market with its
Betamax videocassette recorder. Yet Sony still lost a battle to set
standards for the DVD, the digital videodisc.
</P>
<P>
   Even how AOL and Warner Music Group will work together is not
clear. The simple model _ that AOL will become the big Internet
distribution and promotional arm of Warner Music _ has its
limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Leonsis said that AOL will have to work with all record
companies, not just Warner, because consumers would be reluctant to
visit any site that offered only one brand. Besides, fans of a
particular singer or group ``typically don't know what label
they're on,'' said Andrea Fleming, vice president of corporate
marketing for Liquid Audio, an online music company.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Music Group wants to deal with several online retailers,
said Paul Vidich, executive vice president of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Warner might benefit from special promotions on AOL or
from AOL's expertise in developing Internet services. Leonsis said,
for instance, that in the 1980s Warner Music took advantage of
music videos earlier than other record companies because its parent
company owned MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Vidich said Warner Music was already benefiting from a
cutting-edge image from its pending association with AOL. ``In the
last week at least two companies have come to us with ideas and
said Warner is now the perfect partner for them,'' he said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Music, whose labels include Reprise, Elektra and
Atlantic, is perceived in the industry as having been less
aggressive than many of its peers in moving online.
</P>
<P>
   Vidich disputes that notion, saying the company has been
developing a comprehensive system for promoting and selling music
on the Web, including digital downloads, that it will introduce in
the middle of this year. Time Warner has stakes in three start-up
companies distributing music or music videos digitally and is also
becoming a part owner of CDNow, which sells compact discs from its
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Still, moving onto the Internet is not Warner Music's biggest
challenge. The company has slipped from No. 1 to No. 4 in market
share over the last few years because it failed to develop many new
acts. It also lost or got rid of many experienced executives.
</P>
<P>
   AOL is already involved in Internet music through ownership of
Winamp, a program for downloading music, and Spinner, a Web radio
service. But it has not been perceived as a friend of the record
industry, because it has not been avid in fighting Internet piracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been drawing people to their site using content
essentially as a loss leader,'' said Hilary Rosen, president of the
Recording Industry Association of America, which represents record
companies.
</P>
<P>
   She said Spinner had not yet started paying for the music it
transmits and that AOL initially opposed an Internet copyright
protection bill until a compromise was reached. Leonsis of AOL said
the company had always said that it would ``do the right thing'' on
copyrights but that the online world might be different from other
spheres.
</P>
<P>
   Now that AOL is becoming a big music owner, its attitude could
change. ``Now AOL has a multibillion-dollar stake in making sure
that intellectual property is respected on the Internet,'' said Ron
Stone, president of Gold Mountain Entertainment, a Los Angeles
company that manages such acts as Bonnie Raitt and Los Lobos.
``That's the best news out of this merger.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   So far, big music companies have moved only gingerly onto the
Internet. Forrester Research, a market research firm based in
Cambridge, Mass., estimates that sales of music through the
Internet this year will reach $1.3 billion, about 10 percent of
total domestic music sales. But virtually all of those online sales
will be of compact discs through electronic commerce sites like
Amazon.com. Only 4 percent of the $1.3 billion, or far less than 1
percent of overall music sales, will be distributed digitally
through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of piracy is just one obstacle. Long transmission times
make it unwieldy to download an entire album using a standard
modem. And music companies have not figured out how to make the
business profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Geiger, chairman and chief executive of Artistdirect, an
online music company, said that the prices some companies are
charging to download a song, $1 to $2 or more, will probably prove
too high for consumers used to getting things free on the Internet.
He said music might best be offered as a subscription service, in
which consumers pay a monthly fee to have access to music on
demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do believe that music is going to evolve into somewhat of a
service,'' said Geiger, whose company is partly owned by Warner and
other big record companies. ``Right now it's product only, except
for radio.''
</P>
<P>
   By going online too aggressively, the music industry could anger
its existing retailers and make its investment in compact-disc
plants obsolete. But executives say that as when CDs replaced vinyl
records, new formats generally increase the size of the overall
market and allow the industry to resell the same songs to existing
customers in the new format.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts say electronic distribution is inevitable. AOL Time
Warner might lead the boats, but all will be swept up in the
current.
</P>
<P>
   ``With or without the deal,'' said Danny Goldberg, president of
Artemis Records in New York, ``technology is going to change the
way music is delivered, just as it has in the past.''

CLINTON TO DISCUSS ANTICRIME PLAN IN BOSTON VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN AND ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ President Clinton will visit the Orchard Gardens
housing development in Roxbury Tuesday to preview anticrime
initiatives he will propose in his State of the Union speech
January 27. The president also will meet with street workers who
are attempting to combat youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   It is the second time in recent years that Clinton has chosen to
highlight Boston's success in dealing with troubled youth and to
use the city as a backdrop for new proposals. In early 1997, he
praised Boston's youth programs in a speech at UMass-Boston, in
which he proposed a two-year, $500 million set of initiatives on
youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   Before returning to Washington Clinton also plans to attend a
Democratic National Committee reception in a private home in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Liu, assistant domestic policy adviser in the White House,
said Monday that this time the president will announce $280 million
in new initiatives aimed at improving enforcement of firearms laws.
</P>
<P>
   The money would provide for 500 new agents and inspectors at the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, which he said is the
biggest-ever increase in funding for that agency. It also would
finance the hiring of 1,000 new state and local prosecutors, and
100 new federal prosecutors, to pursue armed criminals and other
gun-related cases.
</P>
<P>
   Liu said Clinton will also propose creation of gun-law
enforcement teams in 20 high gun-crime areas. These teams would
consist of federal prosecutors, crime analysts and an attorney to
work on a coordinated community approach, which the White House
aide called an attempt ``to replicate what Boston has been able to
accomplish through Operation Ceasefire... to provide a coordinated
community-wide approach that engages law enforcement at every level
in an effort fight gun crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Other elements of Clinton's initiative are creation of a
national system for ballistic testing, funding of research on
technology that would make guns fireable only by their owners, and
funding for local anti-gun media campaigns,
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Thomas M. Menino said Monday that Orchard Gardens was
chosen for the afternoon event because of the renaissance that the
housing project and the neighborhood around it are undergoing.
Until the current, massive overhaul was undertaken, the project --
previously known as Orchard Park -- was a hotbed of crime and
violence, and was one of the least desireable low-income housing
complexes in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now people want to live there,'' Menino said. ``Everything the
president and vice president have been talking about for the last
seven years'' in the area of urban reconstruction ``is there at
Orchard Gardens -- economic opportunity, better education, a safe
neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Major assistance for the renovation of Orchard Gardens has come
through the federal government, which has committed about $50
million to assist the redevelopment of the development into units
for rental and for home ownership.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the housing funds, because the Orchard Gardens
area is part of the city's empowerment zone, federally assisted
low-income loans and grants for economic development and human
services also are available there.
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, the president is to meet and talk with
Boston's street workers, who have been the city's front-line in its
widely recognized efforts to reduce youth gang activity and related
crime and violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The street workers are one of the most important groups we
have,'' Menino said. ``The kids trust them. They can talk with
them. He wants to see how it works.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said particular attention may be paid to Boston's
programs for girls, as the need for such programs nationwide has
not been recognized for as long as programs targeting boys.

ECUADOR'S ADOPTION OF U.S. DOLLAR SEEN AS IMPORTANT TEST CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador _ Even in the rest of Latin America, this country
of 12 million has never been regarded as much of an economic
leader. But by deciding to replace Ecuador's currency with the U.S.
dollar, President Jamil Mahuad has thrust his nation onto
centerstage of a heated, continent-wide debate about monetary
policy and economic relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad's unexpected gambit, announced Jan. 9 amid a political
crisis that threatened to topple him, is a textbook example of what
economists call ``dollarization,'' and provides the test case long
sought by advocates of that policy, once considered as much a
fringe notion across the hemisphere as the flat tax still is in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   So for the next few months, both the Clinton administration and
its trading partners from Canada to Chile will be watching
Ecuador's experiment intently _ and with a healthy dose of
skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the only country in Latin America that uses the
dollar as its currency is Panama, which took that decision almost
immediately after breaking away from Colombia in 1903. Because
Panama is so small and was so closely linked to the United States
by the Panama Canal Zone, the rest of Latin America has
traditionally viewed it as a unique and not especially attractive
case in which national sovereignty was traded for stability.
</P>
<P>
   But the trend toward regional trading blocs, including the
possibility of forming a Free Trade Area of the Americas as early
as 2005, has forced a reexamination of that attitude. The success
of the euro, especially as it affects the mother countries of Latin
America, has also made the notion of a single currency for the
hemisphere more plausible and attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joining the euro group has been a more secure arrangement for
Spain and Portugal, with lower inflation rates'' and rapid growth,
said Ricardo Haussman, chief economist of the Inter-American
Development Bank. ``If a monetary treaty can be negotiated, it
could be attractive for Latin America.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists and government officials in the region say the
nations that would be most tempted to follow Ecuador's example are
those of Central America, which already conduct the bulk of their
trade with the United States. In El Salvador, for instance, dollar
remittances from Salvadorans in the United States are now the
principal source of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, many other Latin American nations already rely on
dollars, to one degree or another. At the checkout counters of many
supermarkets in Peru, for example, the bills given to shoppers are
calculated both in U.S. dollars and Peruvian soles. Customers can
pay in either currency.
</P>
<P>
   Other Latin American countries, most notably Argentina, have
formally adopted mechanisms that tie the exchange rate of their
pesos to the dollar and made the two currencies fully convertible
at that fixed rate. And beyond Latin America, only Liberia in
Africa and a few tiny island nations in the Pacific have embraced
dollarization, although Hong Kong has followed an approach similar
to that of Argentina and its currency board since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the consistent strength of the currency in world markets
has meant that most U.S. dollars can be found in other countries.
The Federal Reserve estimates that about $580 billion is in
circulation globally, two-thirds outside of the United States. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Most countries have a large amount of their debt in dollars,
maintain a large percent of their reserves abroad in dollars, and
write contracts indexed to the dollar,'' said a World Bank
official. ``In a country like Argentina, a lot of the costs of
dollarization have already been incurred, so the step to full
dollarization would not be that great.''
</P>
<P>
   Countries adopting the dollar ``may lose some flexibility in
domestic policy issues,'' John Reed, the co-chairman of Citigroup,
acknowledged in a speech to a Mexican bankers' group last year. But
he and several other analysts argue that any relinquishing of
autonomy would be offset by increased investment and capital flows
and other gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Full dollarization, if credible, eliminates devaluation risk
and, consequently, will likely result in interest rates which are
both lower and less sensitive to crisis in other countries,'' said
Dr. Guillermo Calvo, director of the Center for International
Economics at the University of Maryland and a former IMF adviser,
in recent testimony before Congress. ``In other words, the
incidence of contagion will diminish.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who advocate formal adoption of the U.S. dollar argue that
it would also benefit countries in which wage-earners are used to
seeing their purchasing power eroded by high inflation and a weak
currency. ``I don't know of a single worker who would complain if
he were paid in dollars,'' Alberto Fernandez Garza, president of
the Mexican Employers' Federation, said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some analysts even suggest that dollarization could be a
tool to lessen income inequality. Today, Hausmann said, ``workers
are paid in pesos and executives in dollars, and workers can see
the advantage of that. They want exchange-rate stability too.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. position on the issue is one that former Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin once described as ``agnostic.'' While the
Clinton administration sees potential advantages and opportunities
to extend U.S. interests and power, it has also expressed concern
about both the mechanics of the process and the additional burdens
it might generate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never put ourselves in a position where we envisioned
actions that we would take would be of assistance to the rest of
the world but to the detriment of the United States,'' Alan
Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told a
congressional panel last year. To Latin American economists, that
meant Washington is unwilling to extend the safety net of the
Federal Reserve system to any dollarized countries that get into
economic trouble. Nor would the Fed conduct monetary policy to take
account of cyclical differences between Latin America and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   One clear benefit to the United States would come from
``seignorage'' fees that would have to be paid by countries that
abandon their own currency. Though it costs only pennies to
manufacture paper bills, those notes would be sold at face value to
countries adopting the dollar, resulting in a substantial profit
for the U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   ``By acquiring dollars for use in their domestic economies,
dollarizing countries would be extending an interest-free loan to
the United States,'' Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told the
Senate Banking Committee last year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If the entire region were to adopt the dollar, that would amount
to several billion dollars a year, unless treaties waiving such
fees could be negotiated, which Latin American countries have said
they would want.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington on Friday, Summers said that there is no
likelihood of a monetary treaty or any other kind of official
accord with Ecuador regarding its dollarization. ``No formal
agreement is in prospect,'' he said after a speech at the Institute
for International Economics.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a dollar zone would also be likely to accelerate the
integration of Latin American economies with the United States and
create trade opportunities for U.S. companies. ``The United States
has a lot to gain, given that these countries are fertile ground
for absorbing U.S. exports,'' Calvo argued.
</P>
<P>
   In times of conflict the United States might even be able to use
the dollar as an economic weapon, withholding currency from an
intractable government to bend it to Washington's will. Indeed, the
Bush administration took just that step against Panama as part of
its effort to overthrow Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton administration officials have made it clear that,
given the region's long history of political and economic
instability, they worry the relationship could become too close.
Dollarization in the Americas stands in sharp contrast to the
experience of Europe, where a group of countries at similar levels
of economic development created a new currency and established a
new common central bank to manage it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Federal Reserve would be buying the problems of places
like Colombia and Argentina'' if those countries were to give up
their own monetary system and adopt the dollar as currency, said a
senior official of an international lending agency who talks often
with U.S. policy-makers. ``They don't want that headache. Their
attitude is `use your own aspirin.'''
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony to the Senate Banking Committee last year,
Summers suggested as much, saying that ``given the political
dynamics that play out in those societies at times of economic
frustration,'' resentment ``could be vented at us.'' He added that
if dollarization ``led to that kind of sense of eroding national
responsibility, it might be unfortunate for the countries involved,
and it might be unfortunate for their relationship with us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though U.S. officials have thus far refrained from saying so
publicly, nothing about the way or the reasons Ecuador has
dollarized makes them view it as a model. The economy here is in a
deep recession, and output fell by 7.5 percent last year. The
nation's inflation was the highest in Latin America, at more than
60 percent, and in September, the Mahuad government defaulted on
about half of Ecuador's $13 billion in foreign debt, not exactly a
move to build confidence among investors.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the country's economy in terrible shape, but the
decision to dollarize was taken hastily and unilaterally, for
reasons more political than economic, catching Washington and
international lending agencies completely by surprise. That creates
a risk that if the experiment here fails, it will damage the
concept's credibility elsewhere in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Countries can obviously choose to adopt the dollar as legal
tender without our assent,'' Summers said in his 1999 testimony.
``However, such a decision has some consequences for the United
States, and we hope and expect that countries would consult with us
in advance.''

PAPOWS, CITING LOTUS GAINS, SAYS GOODBYE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Outgoing Lotus Development Corp. chief executive
officer Jeff Papows said farewell to thousands of his customers
Monday. So many of them, in fact, that he had to say it twice.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 computer professionals showed up at the annual
Lotusphere trade show at Walt Disney World, twice as many as the
main conference hall could handle. That meant two swan songs, or
keynote presentations, in a single day for Papows.
</P>
<P>
   When he took the helm of the Cambridge, Mass. software firm
seven years ago, hardly anyone would have turned out to hear about
Lotus' flagship product, Notes. Back then, few people even
understood what the software did.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Lotus is a subsidiary of giant IBM Corp., and Notes and
its sister product Domino are the leaders in the growing market for
``groupware'' software that makes it easier for groups of workers
to share data and collaborate on projects.
</P>
<P>
   In his farewell, Papows stressed that he was leaving behind a
company well-positioned to continue its fierce struggle with its
chief rival in groupware, Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is at the absolute peak of its product and its
business strength,'' said Papows.
</P>
<P>
   And while he wouldn't give precise numbers, Papows declared,
``We have far superseded every financial operating objective that
IBM has set for us.''
</P>
<P>
   So why is Papows leaving? Again, he politely but firmly
dismissed speculation that his departure, effective Feb. 1, is
related to a sexual harassment scandal at Lotus, or to a Wall
Street Journal story last year that questioned Papows' assertions
about his background, accomplishments and credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Papows insisted that he had simply decided to seek out an
opportunity to run a small, up-and-coming firm, rather than an
established corporate titan.
</P>
<P>
   Papows admitted that his decision may have been influenced by
the sight of so many upstart Internet companies building up stock
market values in the billions of dollars, even without turning a
profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The village idiots are getting rich,'' he said, ``so given the
experience that I've had, I do think I'd be able to add value.''
</P>
<P>
   Papows said that his successor, IBM veteran Al Zollar, will take
the helm of a very healthy company. He cited numbers from
International Data Corp. showing that, despite increasingly severe
competition from Microsoft Corp.'s rival Exchange product, Lotus
held 41 percent of the groupware market at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft held second place at 34 percent, with much smaller
percentages held by groupware products from Novell Inc. and
Netscape Communications Corp., now owned by America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Papows also boasted that his company had sold 22 million new
user licenses for Notes last year, bringing the total number of
users to 56 million worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   And he held out hope for an even better performance this year.
In response to a question, Papows admitted that so far, less than a
quarter of Notes users have upgraded to the newest version of the
software, R5, which was released last year.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Papows' boss, IBM senior vice president for software
John M. Thompson, admitted that except for the people in his own
division, most of IBM's 300,000 workers still hadn't moved to the
new version of Notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medium to large enterprises take a little more time to plan
these things,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Papows said the slow changeover was due in part to a delay in
releasing the software and also because companies recently held
back on new software purchases, focusing instead on preparing for
the Y2K computer bug. With these issues resolved, he predicted
strong Notes sales this year.
</P>
<P>
   The talk of last year's Lotusphere was R5, a major upgrade of
the software. This year's product announcements were more modest,
but still significant.
</P>
<P>
   Lotus announced that it would create versions of Notes designed
to run on portable Internet devices, such as Internet-enabled cell
phones and 3Com Corp.'s Palm VII wireless Internet device. The
company also displayed Raven, a new product aimed at making it
easier for companies to share data stored in various Lotus Domino
databases.
</P>
<P>
   Domino is software that runs on a server and stores and
distributes information to users.
</P>
<P>
   Lotus also announced that it will redesign Domino to make it
compatible with Microsoft's Outlook software for personal
information management. Outlook is a part of Microsoft's Office
suite of business software applications. Office holds about 85
percent of the office suite market, far more than Lotus' competing
SmartSuite program.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook users will be able to access data stored on a Domino
server without having to use a Lotus Notes software ``client''
computer on their desktops.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement raised the question whether Lotus might be
thinking of abandoning the Notes client in order to focus entirely
on making server software to run on Web browsers, pocket Internet
devices or Microsoft business software.
</P>
<P>
   Not a chance, Papows replied. ``We have not conceded the client
market here. Not one inch.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said that Microsoft Outlook and Lotus Domino users
had asked both companies to make their products capable of working
together. The result, Papows argued, would be a new opportunity to
persuade users of Microsoft Office to use Lotus Domino for
behind-the-scenes groupware management, instead of Microsoft's
competing product, Exchange.

<P>
   CHICAGO _ One employee remembers the time a young girl walked
through the door and promptly burst into tears, not because she was
feeling cranky, her parents told the distressed saleswomen, but
because she suddenly realized she had just entered American Girl
Place.
</P>
<P>
   This 35,000-square-foot building, in the ``Magnificent Mile,''
Chicago's most expensive shopping district, houses not only the
wildly popular American Girl dolls and their extravagant
accessories, but enough distractions to occupy the average girl for
a day or two.
</P>
<P>
   There's the 150-seat theater, where a few nights a week a
five-piece orchestra and a cast of teen-age girls put on a
$25-a-ticket show written for, by and about girls; there's the
pink-and-black polka-dotted cafe, where waiters roll out trays of
petits fours and ice cream sundaes for girls and their mothers and
grandmothers; and a doll hospital where a white-coated woman named
Dr. Sandra earnestly consults with girls about how to fix the
crayon marks inflicted by a little brother (usually a whole new
head is ordered).
</P>
<P>
   Since this store opened in November 1998, American Girl Place
has lured 750,000 girls and women (and a few men) from around the
world, and in its first year in business has made $25 million, more
than twice the original projection, for its parent, the Pleasant
Co., of Middleton, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   The store, an outgrowth of the company's 12-year-old catalog,
offers an experience uncommon in a season marked by the convenience
of mouse-click shopping. Despite the popularity of Web sites like
eToys, where 100,000 toys can be had with a few clicks, devotees of
American Girl products seem more than willing to take planes,
trains and cabs to visit a store dedicated to dolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Internet, you don't even have to go to the store
anymore,'' said Mary Ann McGrath, a professor of marketing at
Loyola University of Chicago. ``Stores don't have a whole lot to
offer other than a unique experience. American Girl has taken it to
a new level. They obviously have products to sell, but they've
melded it into this new idea of a museum combined with a store.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, it is a one-store idea. The company is looking into
opening a second store within a couple of years, said Anne Maddox,
a company vice president and general manager of American Girl
Place, but has no plans for planting multiple stores around the
country anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Burt Flickinger III, managing director of Reach Marketing,
retail consultants in Westport, Conn., said American Girl Place was
making the right move by ``creating buzz with an on-land store,''
as opposed to just jumping online.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a very strong format, they've got a great business
concept and a loyal consumer _ there's tremendous room for them to
grow now, either online or on land,'' said Flickinger, who compared
American Girl Place with Niketown, a store that created excitement
in the early '90s by initially opening just one store in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McGrath, who has studied the different ways men and women
shop, said, ``You know when you walk in there, you're going to
leave with something.''
</P>
<P>
   That something might be a doll from the American Girl
Collection, historical dolls accompanied by books that tell their
``life stories.'' There are six in all, including Molly, a girl who
makes mischief at home while her father is serving in World War II,
and Addy, a former slave girl who has escaped the South with her
mother.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a ``Dress like your Doll'' section, where one can
find girl-sized versions of Molly's plaid skirt and sweater, or the
bonnet and dress worn by Felicity, the Colonial settler girl. Girls
are encouraged to bring their dolls, and to stay all day if they
want.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a group of women and girls flew in from Maryland to
spend the weekend at American Girl Place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to laugh at my girlfriend, saying I'd never spend that
kind of money on a doll,'' said Kathi Picard, from the Chicago
suburb of Brookfield, who was fulfilling a three-month promise to
her three daughters by taking them to the store on a Friday the
week before Christmas. ``Now, I'm more nuts about it than my kids.
It's gotten kind of nuts with the clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter Lauren, 10, owns all six American Girl dolls and
was eyeing a band costume with accompanying flute. She and her
8-year-old sister, Julie, had each brought an American Girl doll
from home.
</P>
<P>
   The store also gets its share of male customers, many clutching
lists. Tim Tracy, from the Chicago suburb of Winnetka, estimates he
has spent more than $1,000 here on his two younger daughters since
the store opened.
</P>
<P>
   The store, though, is meant to appeal to women, Ms. McGrath
said. ``There's a very strong sense of texture, as opposed to a
real simple product display,'' she said. ``A uniquely male store is
something like the Sharper Image or Brookstone, which women find
very boring because there's just one of something, there's no
choice, and women like to feel that they're putting something
together _ an outfit, a story. And that's what this has really hit
upon. The woman who started this at least intuitively knew that.''
</P>
<P>
   That woman is Pleasant Rowland, a married but childless
entrepreneur who morphed from a school teacher to a newscaster
before founding the Pleasant Co. in 1986, offering dolls and books
by catalog. In 1998, the company was sold to Mattel for $700
million, and although Ms. Rowland was named a vice president,
Pleasant Co. remained a separate entity. In 1999, Pleasant Co.
earned $300 million, more than two-thirds of it through its
catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maddox dismissed criticism that the store, loaded with $84
dolls and accessories, like a tiny Macintosh computer that (sort
of) works, is an exclusive playground for rich girls and their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can spend one dollar here and have a wonderful time,'' she
said. ``This is a place just for girls, and there is really nothing
else quite like it.''

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Professor Bruce Gans was wildly pacing the front of
classroom A-307, dashing from Yeats' ``Second Coming'' to Keats'
``Ode to a Nightingale,'' with brisk detours through the Bible,
T.S. Eliot, Nietzsche and Arthur Miller.
</P>
<P>
   The setting for this meditation on the great works of Western
civilization was not Oxford or Harvard or even the University of
Chicago. It was a night class at Wilbur Wright College, a community
college on this city's North Side that caters to high school
graduates considered not ready for four-year institutions, as well
as to X-ray technicians, cellular phone salesmen and bank tellers
looking to better their lot.
</P>
<P>
   That so many of the students were Hispanic or black was
noteworthy, for their backgrounds are barely reflected in the works
that Gans teaches. And yet, in only the second year since the
college started its ``great books program,'' in which Gans plays a
starring role, 900 students have enrolled in courses under the
curriculum's umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   The program's popularity, mirrored in similar new efforts at a
dozen colleges across the country, would seem to rebut those
critics who have long dismissed the relevance of courses that
celebrate the works of a cadre of writers who are almost
exclusively white, male and dead. But the classics, it seems, are
making a comeback of sorts, sometimes in unexpected places.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wanted to learn more about black writers, Hispanic
writers, minority writers, I'd take a course in Aztec culture or
Mexican culture,'' said Oscar Martinez, a 23-year-old Mexican
immigrant who studied Swift's ``Gulliver's Travels'' with Gans last
semester. ``I'm here to make myself a more intellectual person,
regardless of my race, regardless of my background.''
</P>
<P>
   The new program at Wright, which, like those at the other
colleges, began over the last three years, allows students to earn
a special minor or certificate by taking a concentration of courses
on the so-called great books of the Western canon.
</P>
<P>
   In many instances, the courses themselves already existed. What
is different is that the institutions, most of them ranked in the
middle-to-lower end of the national academic pack, are taking steps
to underline such classes and to emphasize that they are critical
to a liberal arts education _ in ways that recall the pioneering
``great books programs'' at the University of Chicago and Columbia
in the early 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Deans at a number of institutions involved say that it would
have been virtually unthinkable to create these programs a decade
ago when the classics were under heavy fire. But they say that the
addition, since then, of minors or certificates in women's studies,
African-American studies and gay and lesbian issues have opened a
window for those who feel the canon should get its due.
</P>
<P>
   All of the new programs are steeped in long-dead European or
other Western thinkers from Aristotle to Hemingway, according to
the National Association of Scholars, a conservative organization
that encourages and records the germination of such classes.
</P>
<P>
   And in defining the courses as largely Western, the colleges _
including Clemson University in South Carolina and the University
of Wisconsin at Milwaukee _ are perhaps writing the next chapter in
the two-decades-old debate over which works should be considered
great, a fierce cultural discussion that shows no signs of abating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt that this signifies a great shift in the culture wars
back to traditional learning,'' said Gerald Graff, the associate
dean for curriculum and pedagogy at the University of Illinois at
Chicago. ``What it does signify is the unresolved nature of the
issues in the debate, the fact that 10 to 15 years after these
issues erupted, they are still very much roiling under the
surface.''
</P>
<P>
   The classical canon has been battered by critics who argue that
it reflects a Eurocentric and sexist bias, one that has long
excluded worthy African-American, Hispanic, African, Asian and
female writers. In response, many colleges began increasing the
number of works by once marginalized authors like the Harlem
Renaissance writer Zora Neale Hurston and more contemporary writers
like Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Toni Morrison and Maya Angelou.
</P>
<P>
   The assault on the traditional Western canon reached its apex in
1995 when Yale University, under immense political pressure,
refunded a $20 million gift from an alumnus, Lee M. Bass, who had
sought to create a wide-ranging curriculum centered on the writing,
history, art and geography of Western civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Though hardly on the scale of the aborted Yale effort, the
inauguration of Western literature programs at colleges like
Wright, and the repackaging of existing courses like those at the
University of Wisconsin, have been shepherded in many cases by
professors allied with the National Association of Scholars, which
is based in Princeton, N.J. The association said it helped stoke
this revival in a conference at Lake Tahoe, Nev., in 1997, to which
it invited three dozen professors. The professors said they then
had to sway their colleagues to approve the programs, often after
fiery debates.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the new programs have been started on a shoestring
by people who say they believe that such courses have been diluted
in the name of political correctness. The Wright program, which
receives no outside financing, has a budget of about $1,000 for
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, students can now
pursue a certificate ``in the study of the liberal arts through the
great books,'' a rigorous endeavor that requires them to take a
two-semester survey course in Western civilization and five courses
in ``the great books.'' The program, which withstood a yearlong
battle in various faculty committees, emphasizes Homer, Plato and
Dante, among other Western writers, although there have been
one-time courses in the Koran and Sanskrit epics.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At Delta State, a university of about 4,000 students midway
between Jackson, Miss., and Memphis, Tenn., a new minor in the
``great books'' centers on four courses: the classical tradition
(Herodotus, Euripides), the Judeo-Christian tradition (St.
Augustine, Chaucer), the early modern world (Hume, Jane Austen),
and the modern world (Freud, Darwin).
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some discussion that at one time we could add a
non-Western section, `great works of the Asian tradition,' or
something like that,'' said Miriam C. Davis, an assistant professor
of history at Delta State. ``The problem is we don't have anyone
who feels qualified to teach it.''
</P>
<P>
   As Gans of Wright College sees it, virtually all the writers who
have asked the most profound questions about life _ and posited the
most eloquent answers _ did so at least 50 years ago, and more
likely centuries earlier. That theirs happens to be an
overwhelmingly white male club, he said, is no reason to
counterbalance their works with those of more contemporary writers,
many of them minorities, who have yet to pass the test of time _ no
matter that some, like Garcia Marquez, have won the Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Gans added: ``I wanted these kids to have a certificate where
they could go to a four-year institution and say: `When I was at
Wright College, I read the best that was thought and said. I
learned about Thucydides. I learned about Schopenhauer, Plato,
Mill, Aristophanes, Kant.'''
</P>
<P>
   One of Gans' students, Keith Morgan, 31, who enrolled at Wright
after being honorably discharged from the Army as a sergeant in
1996, said he had seen much of himself in the story of another
returning veteran: Jay Gatsby. No matter that ``The Great Gatsby''
and its creator, F. Scott Fitzgerald, were white, and Morgan is
black.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a dream, just like Gatsby, to be successful,'' said
Morgan, who hopes to become a guidance counselor and believes that
a knowledge of the Western classics will help.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, as a black man, you have to get past your color and
just appreciate what's being written,'' Morgan continued.
``Professor Gans chooses really good titles.''
</P>
<P>
   That, like so much of the discussion surrounding the classics,
is open to debate.
</P>
<P>
   In starting the ``great books program'' at Wright, Gans proposed
the Bible and the Koran and, as his roster of acceptable authors,
more than 140 writers drawn largely from a list of the classics
compiled by Encyclopaedia Britannica. James Baldwin, Ralph Ellison,
Frederick Douglass and Charlotte and Emily Bronte were among fewer
than a dozen who were minorities or women.
</P>
<P>
   There was no shortage of teachers and administrators at Wright
who challenged Gans' definition of ``great,'' including Romell
Murden, the dean of student services and the chairwoman of the
college's African-American Heritage Month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if it's Britannica who says this or Gans,'' Dean
Murden said, ``there are other great thinkers they can pull out for
Gans to teach. To believe otherwise is racist in itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Keenly sensitive to such concerns, administrators at Wright
struck a compromise that drew more than a dozen other professors,
who teach more than 30 courses, under the ``great books'' tent.
Those professors at Wright who wish to have their courses imprinted
with the classics designation must draw at least half of the books
on their syllabuses from the list put forth by Gans, though many
have followed his lead more closely.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   What may be most remarkable at Wright, a school in which no
ethnic or racial group is dominant, is that the courses centered on
writers who were almost exclusively from Western Europe, white
America or ancient Greece or Rome have been most popular with the
students who grew up worlds away.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who moved to Chicago from Mexico when he was a boy,
wrote a paper for Gans in which he compared the climate in the
cleaning-equipment factory where he worked to the disengaged
theorists whom Gulliver observes on Laputa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have encountered similar individuals as the ones described
by Gulliver,'' wrote Martinez, who wants to be an engineer. ``They
are my employers. Although they work in the same environment, they
do not converse with the common people (factory employees).''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who received an ``A'' on the paper, said he decided to
quit his job after writing those words.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As a graduate of the University of Wisconsin who struggled
through Shakespeare with Cliffs Notes at his side, Gans, 49, says
he empathizes with his students, who often labor to make sense of
works that have confused even the most erudite scholars. But he
believes that whatever his students extract from the classics is
beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything you get out of something profound,'' he said, ``is
better than getting 100 percent out of something of no
significance.''

CANADIAN STOCK-TRADING CASES LIKELY TO GO TO COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Canada's top securities watchdog, the Ontario
Securities Commission, has added muscle and sharpened its teeth
over the past two years. It is currently pushing three high-profile
cases _ two involving insider trading _ into court, where
convictions would help reverse a belief that stock-market scandals
occur frequently in this country because there is little risk for
wrongdoers.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the commission and for Michael Cowpland, the
chairman and chief executive of Corel Corp., are currently arguing
over whether an insider-trading case will be tried in Toronto or
Ottawa. The charges, made in October, relate to Cowpland's sale of
$13 million worth of stock in mid-1997, just before the software
maker released an unexpectedly poor earnings report.
</P>
<P>
   Corel's head office is in Kanata, Ontario, near Ottawa, so
Cowpland wants the case tried there. The commission prefers a court
in Toronto, its home base. Either way, commission officials expect
the trial to begin in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   An action against John Felderhof, the former vice chairman and
chief geologist of defunct Bre-X Minerals Ltd., may get under way
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, the commission charged Felderhof with insider trading
_ reaping a $57 million gain _ and violations of other securities
laws. He is the only person charged so far in the Bre-X fraud, the
biggest in Canada's rich history of mining scams. The stock-market
value of the Calgary company hit $4 billion before its gold find in
Indonesia was found in 1997 to be worthless.
</P>
<P>
   It is significant that these allegations _ and others _ will be
tried in civil court rather than brought to a commission hearing,
because the court can levy a fine, while the usual penalty handed
down by the commission is a temporary suspension of the right to
trade stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The third case that could go to court this year involves the
officers and directors of YBM Magnex International Inc., which is
also out of business. The shares of YBM, which had links to the
Russian mob, were once part of the Toronto Stock Exchange's
prestigious 300 index. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating
the mob ties. Ten people and two underwriting firms have been
charged with numerous securities offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The legal process for YBM is certain to be a long one, so it is
on insider trading that the commission hopes to first establish
important precedents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insider trading is the worst offense that can be committed in
this industry,'' said Michael Watson, director of the commission's
enforcement branch in a recent interview. When ordinary investors
are so clearly disadvantaged, he said, ``It's very important that
we make it clear that we will undertake these cases.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission has not always been so aggressive, nor has it
claimed many victories on insider-trading actions in the past. Two
big cases have been fumbled in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly dropped in 1991 was an action against William Bennett, a
former premier of British Columbia, and his brother, who sold
shares in Doman Industries Ltd. just before a plan to sell the west
coast forest producer was aborted. Charges were also made against
Harbanse Doman, chairman and president of the company. The British
Columbia Securities Commission pursued the case, convicted the trio
in 1996 and, after having its position weakened on appeal,
negotiated a settlement last year.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, in 1996, David Fingold, a director of Cineplex
Odeon Corp., a motion-picture chain, was acquitted on charges of
selling $20 million worth of stock in advance of poor results. A
judge ruled the commission had filed its charges too late.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, who moved to the commission from the British Columbia
Securities Commission nine months ago, is determined to get better
results. ``We wouldn't have started these cases if we had a fear of
losing them,'' he said. ``We are taking a more firm stand, and
there is less incentive to settle, because we've now got the
resources to proceed through the process.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He might be less confident if the commission had not undergone a
restructuring over the past two years _ one that has greatly
increased its budget and manpower.
</P>
<P>
   After paying little heed to the agency for decades, the
provincial government realized it had to be strengthened to deal
with growing concerns about investor protection and the reputation
of Toronto as the country's financial center.
</P>
<P>
   It also became clear that a much-discussed federal body, like
the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States, would
not become a reality, because securities regulation falls under the
jurisdiction of the individual provinces in Canada and the
provincial government of Quebec has refused to give it up.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years the commission's budget has been bumped
by 86 percent to $28 million a year. Its staff count is well on the
way to being doubled to about 330, and more competitive salaries
should slow the revolving door that used to carry the best of them
to firms in Toronto's investment community. Watson's enforcement
arm will more than double in size to almost 80 people.
</P>
<P>
   With the buildup of in-house expertise, the commission now
rarely hires outside counsel to prosecute its cases. Watson said
his aim is to have, within the commission, ``the best
securities-litigation firm in the province.''

COURT SAVES WOLVES, OTHER RECOVERY PROGRAMS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt called a decision last
week by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ``a ringing
endorsement of our wolf reintroduction program in Yellowstone
National Park and central Idaho.'' Many farmers and ranchers in the
affected regions had hoped that a 2-year-old federal district
court's decision to dismantle the program would be upheld.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt regards the Jan. 13 appeals court decision overruling
the lower federal court as ``a welcome vindication of our efforts
to preserve this magnificent species.''
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, Judge William Downes of the U.S. District
Court of the District of Wyoming ruled that the U.S. Fish &AMP;
Wildlife Service, as an agency of the Department of the Interior,
had violated the Endangered Species Act and the intent of Congress
with its wolf recovery program.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, Canadian gray wolves were relocated in
Yellowstone and central Idaho and considered an ``experimental and
nonessential'' wolf population, which means they lost much of the
protection they would otherwise have under the Endangered Species
Act. Any stray wolves already in the regions or who migrate there
also lose the protective shield that the law provides.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the Endangered Species Act in 1973 to ``provide
for the conservation, protection, restoration, and propagation of
species of fish, wildlife, and plants facing extinction.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the act, the Department of the Interior is not allowed to
introduce an experimental population of an endangered species in
the same geographical area where there is already an existing
population of the same species. Part of the lower federal court's
decision pivoted on the term ``population.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolves do wander through Yellowstone and central Idaho. However,
do stragglers or wolves traveling with mates constitute a
population?
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Fish &AMP; Wildlife Service issued its Final
Environmental Impact Statement on the wolf reintroduction plan. It
stated: ``Scientific evidence does not indicate that any population
of wolves persisted or currently exists in the Yellowstone or
central Idaho areas.''
</P>
<P>
   But in his ruling, Downes equates individual wolves with
naturally occurring populations. He asserts that ``Congress has
stated the `experimental population' cannot include naturally
occurring wolves. ... The introduction of an experimental
population cannot operate as a de facto `delisting' of naturally
occurring wolves.''
</P>
<P>
   Downes concludes that the Department of the Interior's ``blanket
treatment of all wolves found within the designated experimental
population areas as experimental animals is contrary to law.'' The
judge's decision set aside the wolf recovery plan and ordered all
the introduced wolves and their offspring removed from Yellowstone
and central Idaho. Recognizing the importance and the ramifications
of his ruling, Downes imposed a stay on his judgment pending an
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals had little patience with
Downes' legal reasoning. It pounced on the soft spot in his
analysis like Dracula on a jugular vein.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court begins with basic separation of powers
tradition: If Congress has clearly spoken to a national public
policy issue, then unless Congress has taken an unconstitutional
position, a federal court bows to its authority. If Congress is
silent on the issue and has delegated authority over the matter to
a lawful federal agency, then the court defers to the agency's
interpretation _ unless that is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   In the Endangered Species Act, Congress did not define the term
``population''; therefore, the appellate court reasoned, ``Congress
deliberately left the resolution of this type of
management/conservation issue to the Department (of the
Interior).''
</P>
<P>
   And federal wildlife biologists define a wolf ``population'' as
at least two wild breeding pairs that raise at least two young in
an area for the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that a naturally occurring wolf population
existed in Yellowstone or central Idaho prior to the introduction
of the gray wolves. Therefore, concluded the appellate court, on
that question, the Department of the Interior did not violate the
Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court wasted little time on the issue of ``de
facto `delisting''' of wolves already in the area, which Downes
found in violation of the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court wrote: ``We believe this holding
unnecessarily limits the administrative discretion and flexibility
Congress intentionally incorporated into section 10(j) (of the
ESA), ignores biological reality, and misconstrues the larger
purposes of the Endangered Species Act.''
</P>
<P>
   The court explains further: ``It is not difficult to imagine
that sound population management practices tailored to the
biological circumstances of a particular species could facilitate a
more effective and efficient species-wide recovery, even if the
process renders some individual animals more vulnerable. ...
Congress left such decisions to the department. We conclude the
department reasonably exercised its management authority.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little chance that the U.S. Supreme Court will grant an
appeal, even if one were requested. There is no conflict among
federal appeals courts concerning the legality of the wolf
reintroduction program.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th Circuit Court's ruling not only ensures that the wolf
reintroduction program is safe, it ensures that other wildlife
recovery programs can go forward without jeopardy. This decision is
a significant step toward saving our endangered species and
maintaining the diversity of our wildlife.

<P>
   THE REALITY OF `HURRICANE' IS STILL STORMY
</P>
<P>
   The unhappy reality about happy movie endings is that often the
actors in the true-life drama do not go off blithely into the
sunset holding hands _ or talking for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Such a chill is apparent in the promotional appearances
surrounding the books and ``Hurricane,'' the new film exploring the
life of Rubin (Hurricane) Carter, the boxer who was jailed for
nearly 20 years for a triple murder he did not commit.
</P>
<P>
   The film was adopted from two books, including Carter's 1974
autobiography, ``The 16th Round,'' and Sam Chaiton and Terry
Swinton's updated 1991 book, ``Lazarus and the Hurricane.'' Chaiton
and Swinton are part of a group of Canadians who befriended Carter
and ultimately moved to New Jersey to aid in the efforts to free
him. Later they took him into their commune house in Canada for
almost nine years, but they have not talked in more than two years
despite a movie guaranteed to make eyes mist over warm friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's divorce-like,'' Swinton said, ``in the sense that there
was a lengthy and very close relationship and the people drifted
apart from the stresses that you encounter.''
</P>
<P>
   When Carter and his former friends made an appearance in Toronto
in January for the screening of the film they did not speak.
``Rubin is into a different thing right now,'' Swinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Carter and Denzel Washington came to New York for a
screening of the film. Swinton and Chaiton were in New York, but
were not invited to attend until about three hours before,
according to their publicist at St. Martin's Press, Joseph Rinaldi.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Sakson, a senior vice president for national publicity
for Universal Pictures, insisted that the authors or their
representatives had been told about the event.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded, though, that managing the promotion for the movie
has been ``challenging.'' For example, the movie executives were
not aware until recently that Carter would criticize his Canadian
supporters in a new authorized biography by a former reporter for
The Wall Street Journal, James S. Hirsch. In it, Carter complains
that the Toronto commune became ``another prison'' and he was
treated like ``a trophy horse to fill the coffers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sakson notes that the current bitterness does not ``negate where
they were before. People are capable of doing very selfless acts of
kindness.''

   ISUZU AND CONSUMERS UNION BRACE FOR TRIAL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a high-stakes defamation case set to begin here soon, Isuzu
Motors is saying that Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer
Reports, rigged a test to ensure that two Trooper models and a twin
model manufactured for Acura would tip up on two wheels.
</P>
<P>
   A similar case involving testing of the Suzuki Motor Corp.'s
Samurai is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Isuzu asserts the publisher rigged the test to increase
circulation and fund-raising for its magazine, which accepts no
advertising, and to advance its cause of getting the National
Highway Transportation Safety Administration to establish rollover
standards for sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers Union said it had no motive to make the Trooper look
bad and that the test had been equally applied to all the vehicles
it has examined. The publisher says the lawsuit is an attempt to
silence independent criticism.
</P>
<P>
   As the case heads to trial, several newspapers and television
news shows _ including The Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post
and 60 Minutes II _ have raised concern about the case's
implications for the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Federal District Judge Richard A. Paez, who is presiding over
the case, has ruled that Isuzu must show that Consumers Union acted
with actual malice.
</P>
<P>
   But he also rejected the publisher's request to dismiss the
case, saying Isuzu found evidence worthy of a jury's consideration
regarding the quality of the vehicle test.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to evidence that the magazine knew its test was
subject to driver influence, that its methodology is not accepted
by the NHTSA, and that Consumer Reports failed to include
statistics it had collected showing that the Trooper's rollover
rate was not out of line with other vehicles of its type.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers Union has been sued 12 times since 1960 and has
prevailed in every case adjudicated so far. But even if it wins
again, it would come at a big cost: the magazine spent at least $10
million defending itself.

   ABRUPT DEPARTURE AT THE DAILY OKLAHOMAN
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Oklahoman and its billionaire owner, Edward L.
Gaylord, have long been monuments to conservative certainties and
frequent targets of journalism critics. Just a year ago, The
Columbia Journalism Review critiqued the paper in an article titled
``The Worst Newspaper in America,'' documenting its reportorial
attacks on Democrats, rosy view of industry and editorial savaging
of homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Then Gaylord's son, E.K. Gaylord II, president of the Oklahoma
Publishing Co. of Oklahoma City, hired Stan Tiner to be executive
editor. An ex-marine known for reinvigorating The Mobile Register
in Alabama, Tiner arrived in April, saying he would change The
Oklahoman. And he accomplished so much in eight months that the
journalism review was preparing a follow-up filled with praise.
</P>
<P>
   But before that follow-up could be published, Tiner was gone.
The Oklahoman ran a short article last Tuesday saying that Sue
Hale, a longtime staff member, had been named executive editor. It
said simply that she would replace Tiner.
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   No one directly involved returned telephone calls. Not Tiner;
not Gaylord or his father, Edward L. Gaylord; not Ms. Hale; and not
the newspaper's general manager, Edmund O. Martin.
</P>
<P>
   So curious onlookers sought clues in the articles Tiner had
published in The Oklahoman, a newspaper that is proud of being the
first to call on President Clinton to resign.
</P>
<P>
   They remembered the front-page feature about atheists in the
state, praised by atheists as ``fair, open and nonbiased'' and
condemned by some Christians, one of whom wrote, ``Before June 16,
I would have never imagined such a thing in The Oklahoman.'' The
newspaper still publishes a ``prayer for the day'' on its front
page.
</P>
<P>
   They remembered the complete face lift that turned the gray,
conservative newspaper into a showcase for feature work.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, they remembered the Dec. 16 publication of the
first article in a three-part retrospective on the 25th anniversary
of Karen Silkwood's death. The nuclear-plant worker had been
gathering evidence of safety and security violations by her
employer, the Kerr-McGee Corp., when she was killed in a car crash
on her way to meet with a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the three-part series was a straight-ahead
reminiscence of the federal trial against Kerr-McGee, noting that
the company, another Oklahoma institution, had been held liable _
for $1.38 million _ for allowing its plutonium to contaminate Ms.
Silkwood.
</P>
<P>
   The second and third parts never appeared. Ten days later, an
Oklahoman editorial lauded Kerr-McGee as ``one of the best
corporate citizens in Oklahoma.'' A spokeswoman for Kerr-McGee said
last Friday that ``Nobody in the company called to complain'' about
the coverage. But Tiner outlasted its publication by just three
weeks.

BOMB EXPLODES IN ISRAEL; POLICE SUSPECT TERRORISTS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ An unsophisticated bomb exploded in a garbage can in
the northern Israeli town of Hadera on Monday, and the Israeli
police suspect that it was aimed at disrupting peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli police said they would move on Tuesday into a high
alert in all major cities.
</P>
<P>
   After the bomb exploded at 11 a.m. near an open-air market in
the center of Hadera, some 20 bystanders sought medical attention,
mostly for shock. Several of the injured were retirees sunning
themselves on a park bench.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak said that such attacks were to be
expected ``inside Israel, such as we have seen today, in Lebanon
and even abroad.'' He had just finished briefing his cabinet on the
possibility of renewed terrorism when he received the news, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will act to crush terror,'' he said. ``Sooner or later we
will put a heavy and painful hand on the perpetrators of this
attack. These weeks are critical, and adversaries, whether they be
the Hezbollah in Lebanon, terror organizations operating in
Damascus or the long arm of Iran in Judea, Samaria and Gaza, will
attempt attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prepared,'' Barak continued. ``There is no 100 percent.
But we are a strong people, very tough, who understand exactly the
tasks before us and no type of terror will break our spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli police suspect that Palestinian militant members of
the Islamic Holy War group carried out the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Ephraim Sneeh, the deputy defense minister, said the attack was
similar to one in Netanya last November that preceded
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, the Israelis, suspecting that an attack was in the
planning, swept through Palestinian homes in the West Bank and
arrested more than a dozen Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials pledged their cooperation against
terrorist attacks.

COMMENTARY: THELANDGRAB.COM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Double parentheses should be set as brackets.) 
(lb) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just beyond the headlines about AOL merging with Time Warner and
the Internet retailers having a blowout Christmas, there is
another, more important land grab under way in cyberspace, which by
the time it's over could have an interesting impact on the global
balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   Let me put it to you this way: If you think the French and other
Europeans are annoyed with U.S. economic dominance today, wait
until they wake up and see the high ground that some key U.S.
companies are seizing in the business-to-business area of
cybercommerce. These companies are creating the global exchanges
that are going to mediate a huge amount of industrial e-commerce in
the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing to these exchanges the consumer would see is
eBay _ the auction site, where individuals can buy or sell anything
from their basements. But imagine eBays for a whole set of
industries, where goods and services related to any aspect of that
industry can be exchanged between buyers and sellers.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, you already have Metalsite.com and E-Steel.com,
where construction companies from anywhere in the world can put out
their steel needs to the lowest bidder. There is already
e-Chemicals.com and Chemdex.com for chemicals and life science
products. And soon, no doubt, e-rubber, e-plastics and e-cement.
</P>
<P>
   In a world without walls, these global exchanges will be the
shapers of the rules, standards and technology by which a whole
host of goods and services will be bought, sold, auctioned and
bartered.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of companies are already throwing away their catalogs
and traditional supplier relationships and plugging into these
mega-exchanges, where they will buy everything from paper to
plastics. Because of America's lead in this cyberspace land grab,
these exchanges are being created largely in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of this is still happening just below the horizon, and
the numbers are still relatively small, so people don't see it
yet,'' said Joel Cawley, Director of Corporate Strategy for IBM.
``But estimates are that these big exchanges will mediate between
30 and 40 percent of industrial e-commerce by 2004. Once they get
on everyone's radar screen, it will be too late. The winners will
be established, and the cost of switching from a key site, or
starting up a new one, will be very high.''
</P>
<P>
   These online exchanges usually start out as spot markets, where
excess inventories are sold. But because of their efficiency, and
potential to be globalized, they are quickly evolving into
worldwide market-makers.
</P>
<P>
   Look at Enron. It has set up an online marketplace through which
companies all over the world are now able to buy and sell natural
gas, electricity, coal, plastics, pulp, paper and oil _ and, coming
soon, bandwidth. Bandwidth is the basic electronic pipe down which
companies send their Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Through Enron's Pooling Point Operators _ where ties between
bandwidth buyers and sellers will be established and monitored _ a
school with excess bandwidth capacity during the summer will be
able to sell its surplus to a company with rising bandwidth demand.
Bandwidth deals that used to take months to close will take
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the first to do this sort of thing for trading natural
gas and electricity,'' says Enron's CEO, Kenneth Lay, ``but we
think the bandwidth market will be the biggest of all. It is now a
$30 billion market and in three years or so it should be $90 to
$100 billion. And it will be global. We are already operating in
the U.S., and will soon be in Europe and Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet economy runs on bandwidth, so if Enron's exchange
works, it could be the equivalent of discovering cyberoil _ for
Enron and for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are strong advantages to being the first mover in these
sorts of global markets,'' said Lay. ``When you are first, you get
scale very quickly, and with that comes economies that lower your
transaction costs, and that gives you more liquidity and the
ability to do more complicated transactions than others. We will
have competitors, I'm sure. But it's pretty much a winner-take-all
environment. The early entrants into these markets will in large
part determine how they are shaped. ((And)) once an entity
establishes a strong market position in this kind of global market,
it is awfully tough to overtake it.''

STUDENT LOANS CAN PAY OFF IN LONG RUN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (EDITORS: Note (at) in e-mail address in the tagline.) 
 
By SHANNON BUGGS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Class of '99, your grace period is up. Many of you who
got interest-deferred student loans will begin repaying those loans
next month.
</P>
<P>
   You are not alone.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of American students need financial aid packages of
grants and loans to go to college, graduate and professional
school.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government provides financial aid to more than 70
percent of all post-secondary students in this country. But nearly
60 percent of that aid is in the form of loans.
</P>
<P>
   That means money should not be an excuse for dropping out of
school, because private lenders are eager to make loans backed by
the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   But it also means that graduates often leave school owing more
than they will make in a year working full-time.
</P>
<P>
   Graduates, don't get overwhelmed by your debt. You can pay back
your loans and save money to buy a house, get married, plan for
retirement or any other financial goal you have.
</P>
<P>
   Defaulting ruins credit
</P>
<P>
   A student loan is good debt because it enhances your biggest
asset: your mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential to earn money is probably a young person's most
valuable resource,'' says Sheryl Garrett, president of Garrett
Financial Planning in Overland Park, Kan. ``A good education
increases your ability to make money.''
</P>
<P>
   But you can wreck that asset by not paying back your student
loans.
</P>
<P>
   Once you default on a student loan, you lose your eligibility
for future federal student aid. So, if you're planning to get a
Ph.D. and don't have the cash to put yourself through six years of
school, then you must have a good track record with student loans.
</P>
<P>
   Those of you who graduated and have no plans to pursue another
degree shouldn't think you can get away with not paying.
</P>
<P>
   Education loan defaults are reported to credit bureaus and will
appear on your credit report for seven years. Whenever you apply
for a credit card, home mortgage or car loan, the lender will see
that you didn't repay your loan.
</P>
<P>
   Many employers pull credit reports on potential hires and they,
too, will see the default.
</P>
<P>
   And if that doesn't scare you, maybe this will _ a new law
allows the U.S. Department of Education to chase down delinquent
loans dating back to the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   If the government sues you for payment and gets a judgment
against you, it can seize your bank accounts, garnish your wages,
impound your car and snatch your tax refunds to pay off the loan
and legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   Work with loan holder
</P>
<P>
   Since skipping out on the student loan is not an option, make
sure your monthly payment suits your paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't manage the payment, call the lender and ask for an
adjustment in the monthly amount. There are four repayment plans
for federal loans. Learn more about them at
www.ed.gov/DirectLoan/pubs/repabook.
</P>
<P>
   You also may want to consolidate several federal loans into one
loan payment. This may or may not lower your monthly payment, but
it will certainly help you keep track of what you have to pay and
when. Check out www.ed.gov/DirectLoan/consolid.html.
</P>
<P>
   But if you can't pay anything because of a financial crisis, ask
for a deferment. Lenders often allow people to put off repayment
until after completing graduate school, finding a job, getting
married or any other approved reason.
</P>
<P>
   Interest on the loan accumulates during the deferment, so you
will pay more in interest and take longer to retire the loan, but
that's better than defaulting.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike credit card balances, student loans don't have to be
eliminated immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Student loans have interest rates between 8 percent and 12
percent and low monthly payments. Plus, the IRS lets qualified
workers deduct interest paid on student loans during the first 60
months of repayment.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than pay down student loans quickly, take that extra
money and pay off credit cards, which can have interest rates as
high as 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those of you without credit debt should invest the extra money
in your company's 401(k) retirement plan or an IRA, if you're not
eligible to participate in the 401(k).
</P>
<P>
   Because, even though age 59 1/2 seems far off in the future and
you're just getting used to your first ``real'' job, dreams of
retiring will sneak up on you before you know it, and you'll want
to have the money to make them come true.

WB FUTURE BRIGHT IN SPITE OF LOWER RATINGS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Executives at the WB faced television reporters Monday in the
awkward position of explaining an unprecedented decline in its
ratings even while its schedule includes some of prime time's most
talked-about shows.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-oriented network that brings us ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer,'' ``Felicity'' and ``Dawson's Creek'' is taking steps
toward broadening its base, announcing it will get the next drama
series from one of the creators of ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Turrell, WB's top spokesman, explained to the Television
Critics' Association in Pasadena the chief cause for the first
ratings loss in the network's five-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Year to year, our ratings are down, and although we certainly
don't like it, there are some obvious reasons why,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most importantly, we dropped (Chicago superstation) WGN from
our national coverage,'' he said. The WB last year cut ties with
WGN because, in most markets, the network was carried on two
stations, one cable and one over-the-air. The net loss was 10
million homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In essence in this season we took a necessary but difficult
step back in order to localize our affiliate base across the
country,'' Turrell said.
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed to ABC's phenomenal game show ``Who Wants to Be
a Millionaire'' and the impact it has had on all the competition.
In fact, ``Millionaire'' seems to be the program getting the most
mention by networks not airing it during the two-week TCA publicity
tour.
</P>
<P>
   Susanne Daniels, entertainment president, announced the network
has closed a deal with John Wells, co-creator of ``ER,'' ``West
Wing'' and ``Third Watch'' on NBC,'' to air his next prime-time
series. No concept was announced for the show, which could be ready
as early as one year from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of his success at NBC this season, John was not able
to produce another pilot for this spring,'' Daniels said. ``But he
and (Warner Bros. Television president) Peter Roth have promised us
his next show, and that's all I need to know to sleep a little
better at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels and WB chief executive officer Jamie Kellner both talked
of broadening the network's base to some extent, but Kellner said
the WB is not looking to reinvent itself as another ABC, CBS or
NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a strategy that aggregates a very valuable audience
that advertisers are willing to step up and pay a premium for,
which is what we have, is driving us close to the break-even
point,'' Kellner said. ``I think that, in fact, it will be a
disadvantage one day to be broad because then you become special to
no one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather be narrow and have a unique special relationship
with an important demographic than be a broad network that doesn't
have any group that feels passionately about it.'' &QL;

U.S. RECONSIDERS AIRPORT SECURITY PLAN CALLED DISCRIMINATORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Transportation Department is rethinking a plan
to test whether an airport security measure discriminates against
members of minority groups after the Arab American Institute
complained that the test was worse than the problem it was supposed
to detect.
</P>
<P>
   The institute objected to the department's plan to ask
passengers about their religion and ethnic background to help
determine whether they were being unfairly singled out by security
officers. The institute complained that asking the questions would
contribute to the perception that Arabs were unfairly viewed as
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The security measure, adopted by the Federal Aviation
Administration in late 1997, is called the Computer-Assisted
Passenger Prescreening System. Using secret criteria, it identifies
passengers about whom enough is known so that they are not
subjected to extra security measures, including searches of checked
baggage or more careful scanning of carry-ons.
</P>
<P>
   Before the system was introduced, Arab Americans and others
complained that it might unfairly single out people because of
their race, ethnic background or religious beliefs. The FAA said
that for security reasons it would not say what the selection
criteria were. But the agency said the criteria did not include
race or religion, and the Justice Department, after conducting a
review, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1999, however, the Transportation Department, the
FAA's parent agency, said it would test the prescreening system for
what it called ``disparate impact'' _ meaning that certain ethic
groups received disparate treatment. To do that, the department
said it would survey planeloads of people at six or seven airports,
starting with Detroit, beginning as early as April, and focusing on
flights to Europe that connected with flights to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to determine the ethnicity and religion of everyone
on the flight, to get from the airlines data on who had been
subjected to extra screening and then to determine ``whether the
selection criteria in fact have a disparate impact,'' according to
a plan the Transportation Department sent the Arab group.
</P>
<P>
   The department drafted a form asking passengers for their name,
sex, race, ``ethnicity/national origin,'' religion and citizenship.
It asked the Arab group for help in winning the cooperation of Arab
and Arab American passengers.
</P>
<P>
   But James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, said
he had asked the department to drop the survey idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows we're already viewed as suspect,'' Zogby said.
``If you live in a country where you feel you are judged guilty
because of ethnicity or religion, and then you ask about ethnicity
and religion, you're asking for a form of self-incrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Their intention is good,'' he added, ``but there has to be a
less intrusive way to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Adams, a spokesman for the Transportation Department, said
the department was listening to the complaints, but was determined
to carry out some kind of test.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our interest is security,'' Adams said, adding: ``We won't
tolerate discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the complaints, he said the department was not
certain it would proceed with the survey as originally planned.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby said the computerized system had turned out to be less
offensive than the system that preceded it, which was a secret set
of criteria applied by airline personnel. Women with veils or head
coverings and men with beards who appeared Arab were much more
likely to be subjected to extra security measures when the judgment
was made by a person than when it was made by a computer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the list of criteria is secret, FAA officials have said
it includes factors like a passenger's travel history, which
experts say could, in fact, bring more scrutiny to people who
travel regularly to Middle Eastern countries.

BRUINS TIE THRASHERS; BOURQUE INJURED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Forgive me if I can't get too jazzed up over the Bruins
rallying from a three-goal deficit in the third period to tie the
expansion Atlanta Thrashers, 3-3, at the FleetCenter Monday. The
Bruins now have a league-leading 13 ties (including three in a
row), only one fewer than the number of victories they've managed
through 46 contests.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to be enthusiastic over that. It's even more difficult
to be upbeat about the fact that this team has won three games
since Thanksgiving. In the 23 games since then, Boston is 3-12-8.
</P>
<P>
   Reason for optimism? Hardly. Yegads is more like it.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to fathom how the team can play god-awful in
first two periods and then play so inspired in the second half of
the third period and overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played for 10 minutes _ that's all we played is 10
minutes,'' said coach Pat Burns. ``To come back and be able to
change the game in 10 minutes tells me we can do it. Now we have to
find a way to do it for at least 60 minutes. When fans come to
watch, they pay to watch 60, not 10.''
</P>
<P>
   What they watched at the beginning was gruesome, and it wasn't
just the Bruins' play. Ray Bourque was struck in the face by a Ray
Ferraro slapshot at 16:34 of the first period and lost three teeth
and needed 10 stitches. Bourque went to the dressing room under his
own power but didn't return.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Brunette's goal at 4:17 of the second on the power play
gave Atlanta a 1-0 lead. Shean Donovan made it 2-0 at 11:22, and
when defenseman Chris Tamer boosted the lead to 3-0 at 11:35 of the
third, the Bruins looked cooked.
</P>
<P>
   But they weren't. It was then they decided to play hockey. Kyle
McLaren (on the power play) and Joe Thornton (who also had two
assists) scored 13 seconds apart, at 13:03 and 13:16, to pull the
Bruins within 3-2. Dave Andreychuk capped the comeback with his
18th goal with 30 seconds left in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   It's a point, and the Bruins are desperate for points. However,
if they'd played desperately from the outset, they never would've
been in the mess they were in.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played (Sunday), they're an expansion team, and we're
down, 3-0, with less than 10 minutes to go in the game,'' said
goalie Byron Dafoe, who had 26 saves. ``I'm speechless. We came
back and scored three, that's great, but there are no happy faces
in here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important tie in the fact that we need these points
right now. If there's anything to take out of this game, it's that
we got one point. You just can't be happy with the effort. Ties
aren't bad if you throw a couple of wins in between them, but when
you're throwing losses in between them, it's frustrating because
it's a winless streak.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if there was enough of a feeling of desperation in
the dressing room, the goalie shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope so,'' he said. ``You have to question it once in a
while, though. Where was the effort in the second period? It sure
was there the last 10 minutes of the game, but come on, Atlanta
Thrashers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not acceptable. We've put ourselves into this
situation where we're fighting for our lives right now. Every point
is so important so we have to play desperate hockey right with the
drop of the puck. Our effort just has to be stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fighting for our lives for a playoff spot and the effort
isn't there. It's very frustrating. I don't care if we'd have come
back and won the hockey game. We played for seven minutes. And we
dominated. To show that we can play that way, where was that the
first half of the hockey game?''
</P>
<P>
   Good question.
</P>
<P>
   There are 36 games remaining. Boston certainly remains in the
hunt for a postseason berth, but unless wins start coming, unless
the club starts playing with a horrible fear of what will happen if
they don't win, we could be in for a long run of more ties,
half-game efforts, and an early offseason that will bring its own
kind of upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play desperate all the time,'' said Burns. ``We
have to play desperate from now until the end of the year. Every
single game.''

CELTICS SQUEAK ONE OUT OVER THE WIZARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the rarefied air of the NBA, where real playoff
teams dwell, back-to-back road wins over the Nets and Wizards
qualify as simply taking care of business.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, where the air is anything but rarefied, the wins
qualify as milestones.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Celtics 2 1/2 months to do it, but they finally won
consecutive road games, taking a tight, 105-101 decision from the
beleaguered Wizards Monday at MCI Center. The victory, coupled with
a similarly taut win at the Meadowlands Saturday, doubled the
team's road take for the season and kept it within eyesight of the
No. 8 playoff spot as the season approaches the halfway point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, two road wins is two road wins,'' said Kenny Anderson,
using indisputable math. ``Regardless of where it is, it's still a
win.''
</P>
<P>
   As was the case Saturday, the Celtics persevered and were the
poised ones when things threatened to become unglued. While Antoine
Walker was the glue Saturday, that role went to Paul Pierce Monday.
In easily his strongest outing of the season, Pierce poured in 34
points, a career high, which included 12-of-16 shooting from the
field, 10-of-10 from the line, and a macho 18 points and 3 steals
in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time for Paul to step up,'' coach Rick Pitino said.
``He stepped up.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce was the beneficiary Sunday of a chat with No. 2 man Jim
O'Brien, who subtly reminded Pierce that the team needed more than
he was giving. O'Brien said he was delighted to see Pierce's
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You're right,' '' O'Brien said. ``It was simply a
matter of getting him to focus more. He does lose focus. It's very
typical of young players. Not many understand the nuances of
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Pierce, ``I knew I wasn't playing my best basketball. I
took what he said to heart. For us to win, a lot of responsibility
is going to be on me and Antoine.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce made five shots in the fourth, none bigger than an
up-and-under with 13.4 seconds to play. At that point, the Celtics
were nursing a 102-101 lead, and the shot clock was winding down.
But, as he put it, ``I've been working on that one since the
summer.''
</P>
<P>
   But the euphoria almost was short-lived. Pierce jumped at the
wrong time trying to contain Richard Hamilton. The rook managed to
squeeze off a decent trey attempt, which went in and out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was saying to myself, `Please don't go in,' '' Pierce said.
``Thank God it didn't. Coach would have been all over me if it had
gone in.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't, of course. Hamilton, playing for the injured Mitch
Richmond (ribs), was 3 of 10 for the game. Anderson was fouled,
made one clincher with 3.4 seconds left, and the Celtics had
themselves the W.
</P>
<P>
   The game was played against the backdrop of the most intriguing
basketball story here since Rod Strickland punched out Tracy Murray
over a girlfriend thing. Michael Jordan's presumed ascension to
exalted hoop overseer of the franchise (and, presumably,
part-owner) has dominated the hoop headlines. Monday, a fan carried
a sign that said, ``Jordan and the Wizards: It has a nice ring.''
There was a picture of Jordan showing off one of his six
championship rings.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards players have openly greeted the less-than-hostile
takeover, although Juwan Howard, who had a season-high 31 Monday,
did say that the issue has become a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   If he does deign to take over, Jordan will have his hands full.
Monday's announced crowd was 14,411; the Wizards must use the same
counting system as the Celtics. Washington shot 51 percent from the
field but was undone by 20 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Washington had a 14-point lead in the second quarter. The
Celtics had a 10-point lead in the third. Walker had 31 points, 29
over the first three quarters. Strickland had 24. Both teams made
their free throws. The fourth quarter alone featured six lead
changes, the final coming when Pierce hit two free throws with 6:07
left.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the first of 6 straight Boston points, which gave the
Celtics a 94-89 lead. Howard (14 in the fourth) kept the Wizards
close and a Strickland 3-point play with 36.4 seconds left made it
102-101.
</P>
<P>
   But Pierce made sure it got no closer.

$500 MILLION WEB INVESTMENT FUND FULLY SUBSCRIBED 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ With investors elbowing each other aside to get into
the dot-com world, Highland Capital Partners announced Monday that
it has closed a new $500 million venture capital fund that will
invest in Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   The new fund is nearly twice the size of Highland's previous
investment vehicle and brings the total amount of money under the
company's management to over $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Highland officials said interest in the Boston firm's fifth
venture fund was so intense that dozens of institutional and
individual investors were turned away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were substantially oversubscribed,'''said Bob Higgins,
Highland's managing general partner.
</P>
<P>
   Over 25 investors, or limited partners, put up the $500 million,
including some of the world's leading endowments and pension funds
company officials said. Among those participating are Harvard,
Yale, MIT, Stanford, the Ford Foundation, Hewlett Packard and the
Mayo Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   The individuals tapped to invest in the fund were also expected
to become part of a network of entrepreneurs, high-tech executives,
and other industry leaders that Highland has assembled to advise
the startups and assist them in developing strategic alliances and
management teams.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's Web-based investments will focus on companies
specializing on business-to-consumer and business-to-business
enterprises, as well as ``infrastructure opporturnities'' on the
Internet, Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers liken the current Internet investment environment
to a ``land grab'' or ``gold rush'' and say no signs of a slowdown
are in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Internet startups are mushrooming and over the past couple of
years, they have driven venture capitalists into a frenzy.
Dominating the intitial public offering market, web-based
investments were up more than 90 percent over last year, according
to recent published reports.
</P>
<P>
   Wary of a boom-bust cycle, some analysts worry that the hefty
bets in small Internet companies that are often years from
profitability could backfire, especially if Wall Street sours on
Internet stocks. .
</P>
<P>
   But Highland officials expressed confidence in prospects for
their own fund. ``The entrepreneurs we are backing have solid
business models and are focused on profitability,'' Higgins said.

CHILE'S PRESIDENT-ELECT: SOCIALIST BY PARTY, MODERATE BY NATURE 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ As President-elect Ricardo Lagos Escobar
mounted the stage on Sunday night to celebrate his victory with a
throng of his supporters, Socialists in the crowd chanted a leftist
slogan that was a favorite when Salvador Allende wore the
presidential sash back in the early 1970s: ``The people united will
never be defeated.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point in the festivities, the crowd called on Lagos
to bring Gen. Augusto Pinochet to justice after his expected return
to Chile from Britain, where he has been under house arrest on
human rights charges for 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   But after Lagos, a 61-year-old economist and lawyer,
acknowledged the presence of Allende's widow, he delivered a
carefully crafted message that struck more moderate chords than at
least some in the crowd had come to hear. It was the speech of a
veteran politician whose politics have long been more moderate than
those of his fellow Chilean Socialists.
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of the former dictator, Lagos interrupted the
crowd's chants by promising to let any future prosecution of
Pinochet run its course in the courts without his interference. He
warmly complimented his adversary, Joaquin Lavin, a former aide to
Pinochet. And he promised to forge a government that is tolerant
and respects the human rights of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a defeat for anyone,'' Lagos said. ``I will be the
president of all Chileans. I want to resolve the pains that still
remain from the century that just ended.''
</P>
<P>
   Lagos will be inaugurated in March as the first Socialist
president of Chile since Allende was overthrown in the violent coup
in 1973 led by Pinochet and backed by the United States. Lagos'
presidency will almost certainly be very different from Allende's.
</P>
<P>
   In part, that is because he will be governing in a coalition
with the more conservative Christian Democratic Party. But Lagos
has long been a Western European-style social democrat, even
through the 1970s and 1980s when other leaders of his party
embraced Marxism and the Cuban revolution.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent his moderation is grounded in the Keynesian
lessons he learned while earning a doctorate in economics from Duke
University in the 1960s. But it is also seems to be a product of
his sober personality and what his friends characterize as a
distaste for impulsiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos was born to a middle-class family on March 2, 1938. His
father, a small landowner, died when Lagos was 8. His mother, Emma
Escobar y Froilan Lagos, a retired teacher, cast a vote for her son
on Sunday _ at the age of 103.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Before traveling to the United States for graduate studies in
economics, he earned a law degree at the University of Chile. He is
a weekend gardener, an avid reader of histories and loves Brahms
and Mozart.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike so many Chileans, he does not smoke. But he does like to
take a siesta whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1971 he has been married to Luisa Duran de la Fuente, with
whom he has a daughter. He also has two children from an earlier
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   He plays tennis and does light rock-climbing for exercise, but
his ample waistline suggests he is not a fanatic about either. And
when he talks of politics, compromise and consensus appear to be
uppermost on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is our goal now?'' Lagos asked rhetorically during an
interview on the campaign trail last year. ``Without affecting
investment, savings and growth, we need to produce a society a
little more just with less of a gap in the inequality of
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   During the Allende years, Lagos served as secretary-general of
the University of Chile and had been Allende's choice to be
ambassador to Moscow at the time of the coup. But after the coup,
when many top Chilean Socialist leaders went to East Germany, he
chose exile in the United States and was a visiting professor at
the University of North Carolina in 1973-75.
</P>
<P>
   He said he enjoyed his time in Chapel Hill, although he added
with a smile: ``I had real problems when North Carolina played
basketball with Duke.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1976-84, he worked as an economist for various United
Nations agencies, but then devoted himself increasingly to
opposition politics.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos spent only 20 days in Pinochet's jails, in 1986 during a
general crackdown following an assassination attempt, but he played
a key role in the 1988 plebiscite campaign that led to Pinochet's
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview that year, Lagos had the gumption to
point his finger at the camera _ as if to point directly at the
dictator _ and told him the country had had enough of his
repression, torture and executions.
</P>
<P>
   It was that brave moment of defiance that made him the leader of
Chile's Socialists and its future presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the Christian Democratic-Socialist coalition took
power, and over the next eight years Lagos served as minister of
education and then minister of public works _ positions in which he
sought to help the disadvantaged but also improve his relations
with the business community and military.
</P>
<P>
   He expanded the influence of military academies by allowing them
to grant master's degrees to civilians. And he made sure to
complete Pinochet's pet public works project _ a highway connecting
Tierra del Fuego and the lake-dotted Patagonia region.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   During the recent presidential campaign, he and Lavin studiously
avoided mention of either Allende or Pinochet, as both focused on
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos promised to create 300,000 jobs and bring modern health
care to the poor, but he also made a concerted effort to calm the
concerns of domestic and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   In November, he told a conference of local businessmen that he
would work hard to keep the budget deficit in check and interest
rates and inflation low. ``I know the limits of the possible,'' he
said, ``and I know my responsibility to be a leader who orients the
public responsibly.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech was meant to reassure the private sector that he
would continue the current government's economic policies and not
encourage workers to strike, as Allende's government had done.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos' moderation through the campaign frustrated leftists in
his own party, and particularly angered Communist Party leaders who
had been allies of the Socialists during the Allende era.
</P>
<P>
   But his moderation was mirrored by Lavin, who called for cuts in
military spending and said he would not stand in the way of a
future trial of Pinochet should he not be extradited to Spain to
stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lagos is close to the third way of Blair and Clinton,'' said
Ricardo Israel, a University of Chile political scientist. ``As
president, you'll hear a lot about an ethical foreign policy but
you'll probably see more privatizations than you did under the two
Christian Democratic presidents. And he'll be very careful with the
army.''

INVESTOR BUYS THREE CONNECTICUT BRANCHES OF FLEET-BANKBOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A New York financier said Monday that he would acquire
three Fleet and BankBoston branches in Connecticut and transform
them into that state's only minority-run financial services
institution.
</P>
<P>
   The financier, Peter F. Hurst, said he plans to form a
minority-led investor group to serve as a holding company for the
branches. Hurst said he had signed a definitive agreement with
FleetBoston Financial, the branches' owner.
</P>
<P>
   Terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The three offices are being sold by Fleet and BankBoston, which
have merged, as part of a group of 300 outlets they must divest
themselves of to satisfy antitrust requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Hurst, 44, declined to name the group's members, saying that his
plan was still subject to approval by state and federal regulators
and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. But the participants
include private equity funds and prominent financial services
companies, he said, as well as individual investors.
</P>
<P>
   The group, to be known as Urban Financial Group Inc., would be
led and managed by minority executives, said Hurst, who is black.
</P>
<P>
   The branches in question, in Bloomfield, Bridgeport, and
Hartford, have $88 million in deposits and $8 million in loans.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction would fulfill FleetBoston's previously stated
goal of selling at least some of its branches to a minority-owned
company as a condition of undertaking New England's largest bank
merger ever.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the 300 outlets was the largest bank divestiture in
US history. Most of the branches were acquired by Sovereign
Bancorp, a thrift in Eastern Pennsylvania. As part of the
divestiture, the combined Fleet-BankBoston put aside more than a
dozen branches for smaller community and minority-owned
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had made a commitment to the Connecticut attorney general
and state treasurer and community leaders to selling two
Connecticut branches to a minority owner,'' said Fleet spokesman
James Mahoney. ``In this case, we ended up selling three.''
</P>
<P>
   FleetBoston's previous attempts to sell to minority-led
companies foundered because of price disagreements. Boston Bank of
Commerce, a leading minority-owned bank, was reportedly unwilling
to pay the 12 percent premium that Fleet was asking for the assets.
Other set-aside branches were snapped up by the holding company for
Rockland Trust Co., a Massachusetts community bank.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from Hurst said that Urban Financial would create a
local bank, to be known as The Community's Bank, with diversified
financial services for individuals, small businesses, and nonprofit
organizations in the region. Products and services would include
mezzanine and equity capital, investment and insurance, and
financial and strategic advice. The bank also plans to launch
Web-based services.
</P>
<P>
   Hurst, an investment banker and Harvard-trained lawyer, runs
Hurst Capital Partners Inc., a New York financial advisory and
investment banking firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people of color have missed out on the bull market,''
he said Monday. ``We think it's important to provide both financial
and intellectual capital.''
</P>
<P>
   He might seek to expand his Connecticut franchise into New York,
he said, but would probably not enter the Massachusetts market.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Savings &AMP; Loan Association, in Hartford, was the
last minority-owned bank with a formal charter in Connecticut. It
was among nearly two dozen state banks that failed in 1991.

COMMENTARY: POLITICS OF REAL PORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ An urban person who listens to the
presidential candidates in Iowa can get to feeling sort of
inferior.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lose the family farm and we lose the nursery of America's
moral character,'' howled Alan Keyes in one of the presidential
debates. ``Where did we get the young men and women who were
willing to sacrifice themselves in battle?''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes tends to get carried away. (At one point he said American
farmers ``have the courage that used to be supposedly restricted
only to aristocrats.'') But this time he was only overstating
conventional political wisdom. We subsidize agriculture to save the
family farmers. We save the family farmers because they are good
people, who work incredibly hard and play by the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Hang around here long enough, and your hackles tend to rise. My
own home, New York City, is not generally described as a nursery of
moral character. But it's crammed with people who work 14-hour days
at the family dry cleaning store or corner bodega. If they founder
and lose their life savings, the government may deign to give them
a free night-school computer training course.
</P>
<P>
   This year the farmers are getting $22 billion in direct
government payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should the family farm ... be any more protected than the
corner drugstore or the mom-and-pop shoe store or the little
grocery store?'' Tom Brokaw asked at one of the debates. George W.
Bush looked at him as if he had asked why churches are tax-exempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask the family farmer in Iowa, they don't feel
protected,'' Bush said rather frostily. ``People are hurting in
this state. Family farmers all across the state are wondering how
come we don't open more markets. ...'' He went on for a while,
concluding with a paean to ethanol subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   The family farmers do seem to be hurting _ if the character of
the nation depends on them, we're in very serious trouble, since
there are only a few million left.
</P>
<P>
   One of their big problems is competing with agribusinesses. But
when Congress extends a helping hand to the little guys, the
agribusinesses, who own the lobbyists and give the campaign
contributions, generally manage to land in the safety net. ``We've
increased the payment limit to $460,000 a farm,'' says Chuck
Hassebrook of the Center for Rural Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The great law of special-interest politics is that a group with
moral clout and little more can get Congress to spend money on its
behalf, but it cannot get Congress to do anything that hurts the
guys with the cash.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the hogs. Iowa farmers grow lots of pigs. ``We want
something to do when we're not in the fields in the spring,'' says
Linus Stolberg, who farms in Palo Alto County. He was telling me a
story about sitting up all night with expectant sows that made me
somewhat more sympathetic to the argument that we should all be
paying people to do this stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Stolberg, who's currently supporting Bill Bradley, says the
Clinton administration and George Bush's friends in the Republican
establishment are both afraid to take on Big Pork. Corporate hog
farming has gotten very popular lately, despite the fact that
monster pig herds create an unfortunate byproduct known as ``waste
lagoons.''
</P>
<P>
   Like so very, very many things in this nation, the lagoons are
no problem at all if they're run properly. However, when things
don't work out you get situations like North Carolina after
Hurricane Floyd, where a good part of the state wound up awash in
both floodwaters and pig manure.
</P>
<P>
   Increased pork production helped drive prices into the ground
last year, ruining a lot of smaller farmers. I think I speak for us
all when I say that all things being equal, I would prefer to keep
Stolberg in the pig business and skip the waste lagoons.
</P>
<P>
   Many people think the smaller farmers could compete pretty well
if the federal government enforced antitrust laws and kept the meat
packers from entering into preferential contracts with the pork
factories, some of whom happen to be the packers themselves in
different corporate guises. ``These people are so inefficient it's
unbelievable,'' says Stolberg. ``Who's going to sit up all night
with the corporate hog? Nobody.''

QUAYLE AND ALEXANDER BLAME FALLING VOTING RATES ON $1,000
CONTRIBUTION LIMIT
</HEADLINE>
  (Report: Testing Politics) 
(nk) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Their wistfulness is probably forgivable.
</P>
<P>
   Each held important national office. Each won tough statewide
elections. Each had a set of proposals and ideas about what the
first president of the next century should do and stand for. Yet as
voters in Iowa prepare for the first real event of the presidential
season, the caucuses on Monday, Lamar Alexander and Dan Quayle sit
on the sidelines and consider why they are not campaigning here.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the answer is obviously the fund-raising juggernaut of
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, which at last count had amassed $63
million.
</P>
<P>
   But to Alexander and Quayle, the more serious obstacle was the
$1,000 limit on presidential campaign contributions, enacted in
1974.
</P>
<P>
   In separate interviews, they contended that the $1,000 limit now
serves primarily to clear the field before anyone gets to vote.
</P>
<P>
   They said the limit, combined with the scramble by states to
hold early primaries, was a major factor in declining voting rates
that saw just 49 percent of adults going to the polls in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the system we have got,'' said Alexander, the former
governor of Tennessee and secretary of education, ``the media picks
a winner, the fund-raisers place their bets, the thousand-dollar
limit runs everybody else out of the race, and it is all decided
before Thanksgiving.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, said Quayle, the former vice president and senator
from Indiana, voters say: ``Okay, we're going to have these
candidates. I didn't have anything to say about that. I didn't
choose this situation. It's basically handed to me. There is this
sort of anointment going on, so I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither argued that a higher limit, or no limit at all, would
have enabled him to outdo Bush, whose take would also have been
greater. But without the $1,000 limit, Alexander said: ``I would
have raised enough. The problem is not that Bush has raised too
much, it's that nobody else can raise enough to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that except for a front-runner and an occasional
``media-certified challenger'' (a position Alexander conceded he
held in 1996), candidates find that they cannot raise the money to
compete. If the limit was removed, Quayle said, most of his $1,000
donors would have given $5,000, ``and I'd be out there debating.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Alexander nor Quayle sounded bitter. Each said it is
important to be a good sport. They discussed the system only after
they were asked. Quayle was interviewed on Friday in Phoenix and
Alexander a few days earlier in Nashville. Elizabeth Dole, the
other prominent Republican to pull out of the presidential race,
has also blamed money and the calendar. She declined to be
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the limit has been a frequent proposal from Republicans
in Congress. They have argued that while everything in politics
costs more than in 1974, and the spending limit for presidential
candidates who accept federal funds has grown to $33.5 million from
$10 million, the $1,000 figure was an anachronism.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats and outsiders have been unwilling to give ground
on the issue without getting something in return, and the proposal
has gone nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander and Quayle argued that getting rid of the limit would
not be enough to restore the public's sense of participation. They
argued that it was also necessary to spread the primaries and
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Alexander said, the emphasis on Iowa and New
Hampshire is the equivalent of the National Football League letting
sportswriters pick the Super Bowl teams and playing the game at the
beginning of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love to pick winners,'' Alexander said. ``But we don't
usually stop there. We play the season or run the race. In
presidential politics we say, `Okay, we'll pick a winner. We'll bet
on him. That's it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle said that as a senator, he had introduced legislation
calling for four regional primaries to be held a month apart. That
would be better than the current system, he said, where ``there is
no time for reflection. There is no time for discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   He said another advantage of regional, ordered primaries would
be that candidates ``would have to get to know the whole country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a thing called America,'' Quayle said. ``It's not
just Iowa and New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, who favors slightly more regions voting three weeks
apart, said, ``That would give the candidates a chance to compete,
debate, go home, rest, brush their teeth, and raise some more money
based on their most recent successes.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not object to Iowa and New Hampshire coming
first, if the media would treat them as ``Off Broadway rather than
the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle said he thought any change would require strong
presidential support. That would be difficult, he said, because
after being elected, presidents feel that ``it's a pretty good
system. I made it through. I'm on top of the hill right now, so why
change it?''
</P>
<P>
   If regional primaries could be arranged, Alexander said, ``then
the people in every part of the country would have a chance to
evaluate the candidates, and the issues, and, more importantly, to
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle identified two other factors that he said encouraged
apathy and discouraged voting. He said excessive media coverage of
campaign fund-raising ``reinforces the stereotypes that a lot of
people have, that this is all a grubby game, people are on the
take, and if you have a lot of money you can buy access.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was reasonable for the media to report on
fund-raising, not only because occasionally the reporting turned up
corruption, but ``because you know how much time we have to spend
raising money. It's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   And he said the partisan atmosphere in Washington not only
discouraged voting but running for office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no trust, and people see this,'' Quayle said. As a
result, ``you are going to have people look and they go `Gosh, that
is a congressman!' They roll their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   But both former candidates focused on the $1,000 limit, and each
cited the million dollars that Stewart Mott, the General Motors
heir, had given Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy for his antiwar run in
1968. ``He changed history,'' Quayle said of McCarthy. ``Does that
make him a corrupt person because he took a lot of money?''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander said the limit ``has made campaigns longer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has restricted the candidates' ability to get out their
views,'' he said. ``It has turned Washington into a city of
panhandlers, who accost each other begging for thousand-dollar
contributions as their principal occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has turned over more power to the rich and famous. Pretty
soon the only people able to run will be Warren Beatty, Donald
Trump and the latest Powerball winner.''

WB FUTURE BRIGHT IN SPITE OF LOWER RATINGS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fixes name Turell throughout) 
 
 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Executives at the WB faced television reporters Monday in the
awkward position of explaining an unprecedented decline in its
ratings even while its schedule includes some of prime time's most
talked-about shows.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-oriented network that brings us ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer,'' ``Felicity'' and ``Dawson's Creek'' is taking steps
toward broadening its base, announcing it will get the next drama
series from one of the creators of ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Turell, WB's top spokesman, explained to the Television
Critics' Association in Pasadena the chief cause for the first
ratings loss in the network's five-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Year to year, our ratings are down, and although we certainly
don't like it, there are some obvious reasons why,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most importantly, we dropped (Chicago superstation) WGN from
our national coverage,'' he said. The WB last year cut ties with
WGN because, in most markets, the network was carried on two
stations, one cable and one over-the-air. The net loss was 10
million homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In essence in this season we took a necessary but difficult
step back in order to localize our affiliate base across the
country,'' Turell said.
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed to ABC's phenomenal game show ``Who Wants to Be
a Millionaire'' and the impact it has had on all the competition.
In fact, ``Millionaire'' seems to be the program getting the most
mention by networks not airing it during the two-week TCA publicity
tour.
</P>
<P>
   Susanne Daniels, entertainment president, announced the network
has closed a deal with John Wells, co-creator of ``ER,'' ``West
Wing'' and ``Third Watch'' on NBC,'' to air his next prime-time
series. No concept was announced for the show, which could be ready
as early as one year from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of his success at NBC this season, John was not able
to produce another pilot for this spring,'' Daniels said. ``But he
and (Warner Bros. Television president) Peter Roth have promised us
his next show, and that's all I need to know to sleep a little
better at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels and WB chief executive officer Jamie Kellner both talked
of broadening the network's base to some extent, but Kellner said
the WB is not looking to reinvent itself as another ABC, CBS or
NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a strategy that aggregates a very valuable audience
that advertisers are willing to step up and pay a premium for,
which is what we have, is driving us close to the break-even
point,'' Kellner said. ``I think that, in fact, it will be a
disadvantage one day to be broad because then you become special to
no one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather be narrow and have a unique special relationship
with an important demographic than be a broad network that doesn't
have any group that feels passionately about it.'' &QL;

BAY STATE BUDGET A `DISASTER,' GROUP SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Despite flush economic times in which state ledgers are
filled with black ink, a government watchdog group says the
Massachusetts budget is ``a recipe for long-term disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   In an annual report by the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation,
the group bases its concern on a succession of large tax cuts and
spending increases that the nonprofit organization says cannot be
sustained indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   That combination, the foundation argues, ``is propelling the
state into a period of much tighter budgeting that will require
difficult tradeoffs among priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   The growth in state spending is expected to outstrip revenue
growth in fiscal 2000 for the second consecutive year. Such an
imbalance, said foundation president Michael J. Widmer, has not
occurred since the state's fiscal crisis of the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Based on state appropriations and income projections, government
spending is scheduled to grow 6.6 percent this fiscal year,
compared with a 4 percent increase in revenue, according to
foundation figures.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Legislature has shown more willingness to fund
increases in social services and education, lawmakers also have
approved a total of $1.7 billion in tax cuts in recent years. Such
movement in opposite directions is doomed to create problems,
Widmer warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules have changed,'' Widmer said. ``It's a paradox
because we're in such good economic times that it's difficult to
understand that we could be entering a period in which the
situation has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The taxpayers group, however, praised Governor Paul Cellucci and
lawmakers for their ``wise use of recent surpluses'' and measures
to strengthen the state's fiscal health, including MBTA reform,
plans for the tobacco-settlement money and an extension of the
investment-tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   However, the foundation said, the state's fiscal health will be
jeapordized if two proposed initiative petitions _ to reduce the
state income-tax rate to 5 percent, and to provide an income-tax
credit for tolls and automobile excise taxes _ are placed on the
November ballot and become law, the foundation said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a development would deprive the state of an additional $2
billion in revenue, Widmer said.
</P>
<P>
   The House chairman of the Ways and Means Committee,
Representative Paul R. Haley of Weymouth, echoed Widmer's argument
that additional tax cuts would strain the state's efforts to
maintain a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you cut taxes that dramatically,'' Haley said, ``you have
to hold the line on so many different accounts and make some tough
decisions'' in areas such as ``education funding, both in local and
higher ed, our assistance to cities and towns, and expansion of
human services.''
</P>
<P>
   But the caution flag raised about further tax cuts will not slow
Governor Paul Cellucci's push for the 5 percent rate, gubernatorial
spokesman Jason Kauppi said Monday. Indeed, Cellucci's budget
proposal for fiscal 2001, scheduled to be released Jan. 26, will be
based on that rate, Kauppi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have shown that tax cuts drive the economy and actually end
up increasing state revenues, which allows us to meet the
priorities of the commonwealth,'' Kauppi said. ``We think that
reducing the income tax will . . . force fiscal discipline upon the
Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   The need to mesh tax policy with spending increases takes on
added urgency, the foundation said, because the so-called
``budget-buster'' accounts present taxpayers with ``a daunting list
of largely unavoidable cost increases.''
</P>
<P>
   Those include surging expenses in Medicaid and state health
insurance, pensions, funds to sustain education reform, MBTA
assistance, capital projects such as the Big Dig, and social
services ranging from housing to care for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Even a continued expansion of the national economy cannot, by
itself, guarantee similar good times for Massachusetts, the
foundation said. The state's tight labor market is likely to become
an increasing drag on economic progress here, the group predicted.

<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ With a strength and exuberance seldom seen
since the days of the civil rights movement, a crowd of 46,000
marchers pointed to the Confederate flag snapping over the state
capitol Monday and demanded that it be removed from public life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flag is coming down today,'' they sang in an updated
version of ``We Shall Overcome,'' on a sunny anniversary of the
birth of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Young people who had
never attended a protest strode next to an older generation that
knew the drill, waving signs, stomping feet and mock-grimacing at
the object of their derision on the dome. Many seemed to act as
though their sheer numbers and deafening decibel power alone might
shake up the state legislators who have kept it flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everyone in South Carolina is still living in the 18th
century,'' said James Gallman, president of the South Carolina
NAACP, standing on the capitol steps and speaking to a roaring
crowd that spread out for blocks around him. ``We are going to send
a clear message to those who have the authority to deal with the
placement of the Confederate battle flag. Let it be clearly
understood that we live in the sovereign state of South Carolina,
and not in the Confederate States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   The march was the largest in Columbia's history, according to
Mayor Bob Coble, and perhaps the greatest civil rights rally since
the 1960s, according to Kweisi Mfume, the national president of the
NAACP who was the day's main speaker. Buses rolled all night to
bring in marchers from Baltimore and Birmingham, many of whom spent
the night with friends to avoid spending a dollar in the state,
hewing to the NAACP's economic boycott of South Carolina that began
with the new year.
</P>
<P>
   It had been only a week since 6,000 white supporters of the flag
gathered on the same steps to praise it as a symbol of Southern
heritage, a reminder of their ancestors' courage in battling to
secede from the union. Organizers of Monday's march desperately
wanted to best that number and had predicted they might be able to
attract 20,000, thanks to concerted organization by the NAACP and
pleas from Southern pulpits.
</P>
<P>
   But no one had truly expected the wave after wave of marchers
that sang joyfully down Washington and Main Streets on Monday on
the way to the statehouse. And in particular, no one had predicted
that so many white marchers would show up. From 5 percent to 10
percent of the crowd appeared to be white, including large
delegations of white elected officials, business leaders and clergy
members. That delighted organizers who were working to demonstrate
widespread opposition to the flag.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The Civil War's been over a long time,'' said the Rev. John
Hurst Adams, bishop of the regional district of the African
Methodist Episcopal church. ``We know you got an inferiority
complex because you lost, but you compensated for that a long time
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina is the only state of the former Confederacy that
still flies the battle flag, although other states incorporate
Confederate elements into their flag. The Georgia chapter of the
Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH coalition is planning to announce
a boycott of Georgia because its state flag includes the battle
flag.
</P>
<P>
   But South Carolina is also the only state in the country without
an official celebration of King's birthday, which was much noted by
many speakers and marchers. State employees here have the option of
taking off either Monday or one of three Confederate holidays
scattered around the year, but all state offices were open for
business Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Although bills to remove the flag and add the King holiday have
passed the state Senate in the past, they have always died in the
House, where districts are smaller and constituencies are often
exclusively white or black. Many participants in Monday's rally
asserted that the large majority of state residents, white and
black, want an end to the divisive issue of the flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of South Carolina says it's time to bring
down the flag now,'' said Mayor Joe Riley of Charleston, who is
white. ``We cannot ignore that the Confederate battle flag was
taken by hate groups. It was taken by the Klan. It became a banner
of the segregation forever movement, and we cannot be insensitive
in South Carolina to the feelings of our African-American brothers
and sisters when they see that flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaker after speaker derided the six-foot banner flying far
above their heads as a symbol of slavery and hatred. Mfume said it
was a reminder that intolerance was still manifest in the form of
militia groups and anti-immigrant sentiment. Many in the crowd
carried signs that read ``Your Heritage Is My Slavery,'' posters of
King, thousands of U.S. and South Carolina flags, while one marcher
carried her membership certificate in the United Daughters of the
Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   There were few spectators along the six-block route of the
march, because most got caught up in the spirit of the day and
joined in. Police officials said the day was almost entirely
peaceful, reporting only one arrest for disorderly conduct. The
Department of Public Safety estimated the crowd at 46,000, but
organizers said it could have gone over 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jim Hodges did not attend the rally to preserve what he
said was the neutrality he needs to negotiate a compromise to move
the flag. He said afterward that the size of the crowd ``creates a
sense of urgency to get this issue resolved,'' but some black House
members on the capitol steps said they would be surprised if their
white colleagues would actually be impressed by the rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``These aren't their constituents,'' said Rep. Walter Lloyd,
D-Walterboro.
</P>
<P>
   But political considerations were beside the point for most of
the marchers, who found if nothing else in the flag an organizing
principle to demonstrate their energy and commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``My little girl has to see that flag every day on her way home
from school,'' said Norma Baggison, a state employee who was
marching next to her daughter Sheila, who is 8. ``But now she can
see that her people is stronger than any flag.''

 &HT;    Georgia women rock Tennessee in 78-51 upset
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ For the last four years, all Georgia coach Andy
Landers could do as Chamique Holdsclaw routinely tore apart his
team was respectfully dub her ``the Great Denominator.'' On Monday,
the Lady Bulldogs may have unveiled her successor in their bitter
SEC rivalry with Tennessee in the high-flying form of Deana Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot junior forward, nicknamed ``Tweety'' for her athletic
ability, equalled her career high with 25 points and played a major
role in Georgia's superb defensive effort as the seventh-ranked
Lady Dogs easily carved up No. 2 Tennessee 78-51.
</P>
<P>
   In snapping a five-game losing streak to the Lady Volunteers,
Georgia (17-2, 3-1 SEC) also inflicted the worst SEC loss ever
suffered by Tennessee. The 51 points for the Lady Vols (13-3, 3-1)
also ties the second-lowest total in their illustrious history.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan, whom Landers has been imploring all season to become more
consistent, scored from everywhere _ on drives to the basket, back
door plays, perimeter jumpers as well as making six of 10 free
throw attempts _ as Georgia humiliated a Tennessee team clearly in
disarray.
</P>
<P>
   Before a Stegeman Coliseum capacity crowd of 10,523 and a
national television audience, Nolan also put the manacles on
Tennessee All-American guard Semeka Randall, who averages nearly 15
points a game but finished with only five.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Dogs outscored Tennessee 47-21 in the second half and
forced the Lady Vols into 32 percent shooting and 29 turnovers that
resulted in 31 Georgia points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a beautiful job defensively,'' Landers said. ``There
was never any pressure on our offense because we were able to stop
them over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Dogs took the lead for good at 26-24 in the first half
on a fastbreak bucket by Coco Miller. Georgia dashed out to a 15-3
run over the first 5:29 of the second half and Tennessee got no
closer than nine. Coco Miller had 14 points and Tawana McDonald had
13 and 10 rebounds for Georgia, while Tennessee was led by Tamika
Catchings' 13 points and 12 from Gwen Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't compete,'' Tennessee coach Pat Summitt said.
``Give Georgia credit, they played so hard. We didn't match their
intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, which plays Georgia Tech Thursday, isn't ready to
proclaim this victory anything more than a big SEC win, especially
since another key conference game looms Sunday at No. 10 Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a real big game for us,'' Nolan said. ``We don't want
to celebrate too much, but we're real happy.''

   CLASSIC-BOOKS-EDUC (Chicago) _ A new program at Wilbur Wright
College, a community college on this city's North Side that caters
primarily to high school graduates considered not ready for
four-year institutions, allows students to earn a special minor or
certificate by taking a concentration of courses on the so-called
great books of the Western canon. What is different is that at
Wright and other institutions, most of them ranked in the middle to

 &HT;    Rams to give Martz job when Vermeil retires
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Having made history a day earlier, the Rams looked
to their future Monday, well beyond this Sunday's NFC Championship
Game. Whatever happens against Tampa Bay, whenever Dick Vermeil
retires, offensive coordinator Mike Martz will become the Rams'
next head coach.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move, the Rams have agreed to offer Martz the head
coaching job when Vermeil retires _ likely when the 63-year-old's
contract expires in two years. No doubt Martz will accept, with
Vermeil's blessing. The first-year coordinator of the Rams'
record-setting offense, which torched Minnesota 49-37 Sunday, said
Monday he's not considering any of the five head coaching vacancies
in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe my future as a head coach in the NFL will be with
the St. Louis Rams,'' said Martz. ''I am therefore announcing that
I am not a candidate for any other head coaching positions in the
NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Already this year's most coveted coordinator candidate, Martz
was, according to media reports, under consideration by Dallas, New
England, New Orleans and Green Bay. While he was hoping to minimize
distractions with St. Louis a 14-point favorite to win Sunday and
reach Super Bowl XXXIV in Atlanta, the Rams also wanted to insure
their future.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't want to lose the best offensive coordinator in
football,'' said Jay Zygmunt, the Rams' executive vice-president
who helped negotiate a new two-year contract for Martz. ''We
promise to offer Mike the head coaching job when Dick is no longer
coaching here.''
</P>
<P>
   ''No one wanted to lose Mike as an offensive coordinator,'' said
Rams president John Shaw, who admitted the glut of coaching
vacancies and interest Martz attracted influenced the Rams'
decision. ''I would say that was a serious factor. We have a
commitment that he's not going to consider any jobs at this time.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a natural fit,'' said Shaw. ''This is what Dick
wanted to do. He wanted to keep the staff in place.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel great about it,'' said Vermeil. ''Mike and I are here
for one thing _ to win football games. And we're doing a pretty
good job now. He's a very, very talented guy. I don't want to work
my tail off and get this thing up here and turn it over to a guy
who doesn't take it even higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil first discussed the plan with Martz a couple of weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was his intention that this opportunity was going to be
there for me. I think it's going to work out,'' Martz said. But it
was Shaw who first proposed this scenario to Vermeil, who endorsed
it.
</P>
<P>
   The move was made now to also allow Martz and the Rams to
concentrate on preparing for Tampa Bay _ and, they hope, Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's been a real distraction,'' Martz said of
questions about other jobs. ''It's very flattering but my
intentions have always been to stay here. And my family's.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Martz's second tenure with the Rams. The team's
receivers coach from 1992-96, Martz was Washington's quarterbacks
coach the last two seasons. Here, Martz's offensive creativity _
along with quarterback Kurt Warner's accuracy and the speed and
big-play ability of the Rams' receivers _ helped St. Louis score
526 points (third-highest in NFL history) and become the league's
top-ranked offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams want all that to continue, through Sunday and beyond.
Martz does, too. ''This is where I want to be,'' he said. ''I do
not want to be a coach at this point at any other place than St.
Louis.''

<P>
   Q -- There is an employee in my department who refuses to accept
the blame when he makes a mistake. No matter what happens, it is
always someone else's fault. I have talked to him about this, but
he hasn't changed. How should I deal with him? H.R.
</P>
<P>
   A -- When you have an employee who refuses to accept the blame
for his errors, no one can blame you for becoming a little upset.
In essence, he is telling you that he is never wrong. Ironically,
he is totally wrong on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   One way to deal with him is to try to focus more on the concept
of coaching, and less on the concept of blame. The next time he
makes a mistake, give him feedback as soon as possible, and base it
on specific performance data. Be sure that he clearly understands
what he did and how his action or inaction led to the issue at
hand. And, if the problem was truly the fault of others, ask him
what he did to try to prevent it from occurring in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, indicate that you are less concerned with
pointing a finger at anyone, and more concerned with preventing
this kind of problem from happening again. You should demonstrate
or model the kinds of behaviors or actions that would have worked
more effectively in the particular situation, followed by asking
him what he is going to do to help prevent this type of problem in
the future. If he continues in his blameless mode, he only has
himself to blame for the consequences that follow.
</P>
<P>
   Q -- I was on a committee with people from many departments, and
we spent long hours working on ways to improve operations. We wrote
a thorough plan that was submitted to management, but that was the
last we heard of it. What do you suggest we do? L.E.
</P>
<P>
   A -- Your company may be interested in improving operations, but
based on the way that management handled your committee's findings,
they do not sound like smooth operators at all. Unless their
objective was to generate dissatisfaction, distress, and distrust,
there should have been a response to your committee's work.
</P>
<P>
   You have heard the last of your report only if you let that
happen. You and your fellow committee members owe it to yourselves
and to your company to find out what really happened to your plan.
You need to know if it is still being reviewed, if it was deferred,
if it was destroyed, or if it has been reborn as shelf liner. In a
word, you are entitled to one of today's most popular buzzwords:
closure.
</P>
<P>
   One way to obtain such feedback is to advise the committee's
leader of the widespread dissatisfaction on this matter, and ask
him or her to set a meeting with management. If this is not
feasible, then you should consider a letter from the entire
committee to management. The letter should not reflect any of your
disappointment or dissatisfaction, but rather should be a request
to meet with management to discuss the report. Management's
reaction, no matter what it may be, will give you a great deal of
insight into the real operations of this company.
</P>
<P>
   Q -- We have a female in our department who gets all sorts of
favors from the manager, and the reason is that she is a big flirt.
She readily admits this and says that it is too bad for the rest of
us. Should we say something? G.M.
</P>
<P>
   A -- When you have a co-worker who is flirting with a manager,
and a manager who is then playing favorites, both are actually
flirting with danger. These types of corporate fairy tales rarely
have happy endings.
</P>
<P>
   There are certainly stories of coquettish co-workers whose ways
and means have carried them far, but there are many more whose
charms have lost their magic, and whose career has done likewise.
When the cute relationships with their managers fade, as most
inevitably do, the working relationships typically evolve into
hostility, discomfort and antagonism.
</P>
<P>
   These are not exactly the building blocks for job satisfaction
or career advancement. And, employees who have relied on style over
substance for many years often find that there is no substance left
when they really need it.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a manager who is foolish enough to fall for
the flirtatious employee is equally vulnerable. Your manager will
soon find that his favoritism is taking its toll on departmental
cooperation, coordination, and communication, as well as on the
respect that you and your associates have for him. Ultimately, this
can take a toll on departmental productivity, and that can take a
toll on your manager's career.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, you should say nothing. Their actions speak
louder than your words.

 &HT;    Championship challenges: Can Titans, Bucs stop steamroller
offenses?
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Something will have to give in Sunday's NFL conference
championship games.
</P>
<P>
   The favorites _ the Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC and St.
Louis Rams in the NFC _ feature two of the league's most prolific
offenses. Their opponents have two of the NFL's more stingier
defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Can the Titans and Buccaneers score enough points to upset the
Jags and Rams? Can the underdogs slow down the NFL' reigning
offensive juggernauts? Can anyone?
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen a defense that has done it yet,'' Rams
quarterback Kurt Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams, who host Tampa Bay in the NFC championship game, might
be the greatest team on turf. St. Louis scored a league-high 526
points this season, the third-highest total in NFL history, and
averaged more than 400 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   Warner was voted the league's MVP after throwing 41 touchdowns
in his first season as an NFL starter. Running back Marshall Faulk,
who had more than 2,000 yards from scrimmage, and receiver Isaac
Bruce also are headed to the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis was held to 27 points or fewer only once this season _
a 24-21 loss at Tennessee _ and has won 10 games in a row at home.
The Rams averaged 36 points per game on the artificial turf of St.
Louis' Trans World Dome.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rams hadn't beaten a team with a winning record until
defeating Minnesota 49-37 on Sunday. And St. Louis probably hasn't
faced a defense as formidable as Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers held opponents to 17 points or fewer in 13 games,
including a 14-13 victory over the Redskins on Sunday. Washington,
which had the NFC's No. 2-ranked offense, was held to 157 total
yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played against some explosive teams and I think our guys
are used to that,'' Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy said. ``It won't be
anything different. We won't be awed by their personnel. They're
certainly no more explosive than Minnesota.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams were better than the Vikings in the second round. St.
Louis scored five touchdowns in the first 21 1/2 minutes of the
second half; Tampa Bay hasn't allowed an offensive touchdown in 10
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to win, we're going to have to slow them down,'' Dungy
said. ``I don't think we'll be able to win an 80-point game like
they had (Sunday). No question, we're going to have to play our
best defensive game of the year because this is an explosive
offense, a unit that's used to scoring points. But we've played
teams like this all year.''
</P>
<P>
   So have the Titans, who will face the Jags in the AFC
championship game at Jacksonville's Alltel Stadium. The Jaguars
crushed the Dolphins 62-7 on Saturday, scoring the second-highest
total in playoff history. Jacksonville's eruption was eclipsed only
by the 1940 Chicago Bears, who beat the Redskins 73-0 in the NFL
title game.
</P>
<P>
   But Tennessee corralled Indianapolis' high-octane offense in a
19-16 victory on Sunday. The Titans held Colts running back
Edgerrin James to only 56 rushing yards, and took away quarterback
Peyton Manning's play-action passing.
</P>
<P>
   But doing it on the road might be a different animal for
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough because they know everything that we
throw at them, and we know everything they can throw at us,''
Titans defensive end
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Holmes said. ``I don't think it's going to be a
Miami-Jacksonville type score.''

ISRAEL-SYRIAN TALKS ARE POSTPONED INDEFINITELY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: the 2nd Take is scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET) 
(sw) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a setback for the Israeli-Syrian peace talks
that was precipitated by a Syrian demand that its major negotiating
point be settled immediately, the Clinton administration announced
on Monday that the resumption of the negotiations had been
postponed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The administration was careful not to blame either side, saying
in a deliberately worded statement by Secretary of State, Madeleine
Albright that ``their approaches to the next round differ, and as a
result, there is going to be a delay'' in the talks set for
Wednesday at Shephardstown, W. Va.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the
Syrian foreign minister, Farouk al-Shara, coming as expected, both
sides would send experts to Washington to ``provide their
comments'' on the draft peace treaty written by the United States,
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official downplayed the seriousness of
the snag, saying that instead of having the two negotiators come to
the United States and ``dig in,'' it was judged that it would be
more productive to wait.
</P>
<P>
   The administration set no public time line for new talks, but
officials suggested they would be working feverishly behind the
scenes to keep momentum and resolve the problem of how to deal with
each side's determination to have their positions dealt with first.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has gone out of its way to try and solve each
side's major issues simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   The resumption of the talks unraveled Sunday when the Syrian
media announced that Israel must make its withdrawal from the Golan
Heights to the line of June 4, 1967, the eve of the Six Day War,
the first order of business in the new round.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, this Syrian demand was made in response to the leaking
in the Israeli press last week of the American draft peace treaty,
diplomats said. The draft was interpreted in the Arab world as
Syria making big concessions _ including the normalization of
relations with Israel and allowing an early warning ground station
on Mount Hermon on the Golan Heights _ without Syria winning a
major concession from the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Another complicating factor for the Syrians was the fact that
the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, has been long scheduled to
see President Clinton at the White House on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrians did not relish languishing in Shephardstown, W. Va.,
while Arafat, hardly a real friend of the Syrian leader, Hafez
Assad, was feted at the White House, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak added another negative factor for the Syrians by
suggesting that he would meet with Arafat and Clinton in
Washington, leaving the Syrians even further out in the cold.

   WASHINGTON _ Elizabeth Dole's endorsement of Gov. George W. Bush
the other day set off speculation that she is angling to become his
running mate, which she coyly did nothing to deny.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush has already virtually ruled out that possibility by
noting he means to pick as veep ``someone who likes me'' and shares
a confidential and ideological rapport. Despite the nice polite
things Dole and Bush said about each other when she embraced his
presidential candidacy, their relationship is inherently awkward.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the fact she would bring little to the ticket
except her gender, which is of dubious value, there are two
deep-rooted emotional reasons why she won't get the nod: her
husband Bob and his father, the former president.
</P>
<P>
   For three decades, those two Republicans rose simultaneously up
the party ladder - one in the executive branch, the other in the
legislative - clawing at each other, stepping on each other's toes,
elbowing each other aside when possible and distrusting each other
all the way.
</P>
<P>
   Their mutual hostility was usually carefully masked from the
public in the cause of party unity. But it surfaced in 1988 when
both were seeking the Republican presidential nomination. In the
New Hampshire primary, when then-Vice President Bush bested Dole,
Dole's response was furious.
</P>
<P>
   Bush should ''stop lying about my campaign,'' Dole snarled, a
remark that was not just the outburst of a sore loser but the
culmination of decades of mutual tension.
</P>
<P>
   The wife and son were technically non-combatants during this
running confrontation, but their loyalty and sympathy are naturally
with their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   To recap, briefly:
</P>
<P>
   In December 1972, Bush shoved Dole out as chairman of the
Republican National Committee; Dole did not want to leave, but Bush
lobbied President Nixon for the job. Both men competed to become
President Ford's vice president. That time, Dole won. When Ford
lost his re-election bid in 1976, Bush supporters blamed Dole's
sardonic performance for the ticket's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, in 1980, both were presidential candidates but
were flattened by the Ronald Reagan bandwagon. When Dole's campaign
collapsed before Bush's did, Elizabeth went to work for Reagan, not
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1980 convention, Dole was among the insiders pressing
Reagan not to give the second spot to Bush, the campaign runner-up,
but to turn instead to ex-President Ford. Reagan ended up selecting
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Dole was stuck in his Senate role so long as Bush remained vice
president, with no real shot at the 1988 GOP nomination against
Reagan's heir--apparent. In 1996, when it was finally Dole's turn
to run for the White House, both Bushes backed fellow Texan Sen.
Phil Gramm for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   It was only after the collapse of Gramm's campaign and Pat
Buchanan emergence as the only GOP alternative to Dole that the
Bushes finally endorsed Dole.
</P>
<P>
   During Elizabeth's campaign, her husband sounded as though he
really supported Sen. John McCain, his close friend. Was her
presidential effort rooted in a dual desire to block a second Bush,
one way or the other?
</P>
<P>
   It is premature this early in 2000 to be discussing a Bush vice
president. After all, Bush has yet to win the Republican
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Politics being politics, however, we can't help ourselves. Who
for veep? It's the next puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has given us some guidelines. He does not intend to pick a
running mate who can act as a bridge to views contrary to his own,
nor one who will merely be useful in one large state, nor one who
represents the defeated faction in his party. He wants a soul mate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain says he doesn't want the job. Note: this is also what
Sen. Lyndon Johnson said, right up to the moment Sen. John F.
Kennedy tapped him for a ticket that would not have won the
November election without Johnson's power to carry Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Bush is reacting to his father's unhappy experience as
vice president. Reagan never once in eight years invited the Bush
family into the White House private quarters. The two men had
little in common and no history of confidential communication.
Nancy Reagan was freely quoted expressing her utter scorn for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But father Bush's relationship with his own vice president
teaches a different lesson. It won't do to pick a blank slate and
hope to write upon it, either. Bush selected a young senator, Dan
Quayle, with whom he had become friends, in the hope that Quayle
would prove a pliable protigi. Qualye proved to be a political
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Bush may be merely following the Clinton script. President
Clinton tossed aside the old rules about geographical and
ideological balance to select fellow baby boomer Sen. Al Gore from
a neighboring state, with whom he felt mentally compatible. It
worked out very well for them both.
</P>
<P>
   So who's left that fits the limited Bush criteria?
</P>
<P>
   Some big state governors, with whom Bush has become friendly in
his years in the Texas statehouse. Some family advisors with
reputations in policy arenas, perhaps in Bush's weakest area of
foreign policy. Some member of Congress who could add the federal
gravitas Bush lacks.
</P>
<P>
   Some Reagan clone, still undiscovered. Somebody from outer
space?

INSPECTING CITRUS FRUIT FROM AFAR WITH A DIGITAL CAMERA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Texas, Calif., Ind.)   By DENNIS BLANK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Growers in Florida are using digital cameras and
the Internet to market their fruit far from the citrus groves and
to resolve disputes when shipments arrive damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The images are often used to augment on-site inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Martin, the assistant sales manager at the Haines City
Citrus Growers Association, said a distributor who was a new
customer recently contacted the cooperative of 200 growers located
just south of Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to see how the fruit looked in a particular bag,''
Martin said. ``We took the picture, e-mailed it to the warehouse
manager, and we got in an order for a truckload.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin called the digital images a valuable new tool, but added
that they cannot replace a physical inspection of the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Cane, president of Voita Citrus in Indianapolis, said his
field buyers in Florida, Texas and California all have digital
cameras. While he said he believed the images were an asset, they
would never be able to replace actually tasting the fruit at the
packing house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it our daily beauty contest,'' Cane said of the
photos. ``It's impossible to describe certain conditions over the
phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Each load that is photographed is tagged to insure that it is
the same citrus when it arrives at a distributor, Cane said.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the supply chain, digital pictures can help
resolve disputes over damaged fruit. Both buyers and wholesalers
say the digital camera is a good way to help verify what happened
when fruit arrives scarred or rotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pictures are the records,'' Martin said. ``We may get
someone wanting to know why the load was rejected and they only got
$2 a case instead of $10.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the pictures, we may be able to show them what went
wrong,'' Martin said. ``A piece of metal may be cutting the fruit
or it may have happened during production.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Heller, general manager of the Heller Brothers Packing
Corp. in Winter Garden, Fla., said the new technology was ``like a
fax machine was in the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be recommending something, and the buyer may be
reluctant or vice versa,'' he said. ``So we shoot and e-mail it to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture has also adopted the new
technology, and inspectors at 12 major produce shipping terminals
around the country are now using digital cameras for marketing and
dispute resolution _ for which it charges $43 an hour _ as well as
for quality inspections.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, Martin and others expect growers to show
real-time images from packing houses on their Web sites as an
antidote to static images of fruit. ``So many sites are real
interesting the first time you see them,'' Martin said, ``but
there's nothing new the next time.''
</P>
<P>
   Les Crocker, citrus sales manager for A. Duda &AMP; Sons Inc. in
Vero Beach, Fla., said there was a downside to using the digital
camera. ``A picture, for some reason, always looks better than the
real fruit,'' he said.

 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The summer of 1997 was unusually dreary for Glaxo
Wellcome PLC despite an unusually warm and sunny season.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo's patent for its prize drug, Zantac, an anti-ulcer
medication that was the best-selling drug in the United States in
1996 expired that summer. Without another patent-protected
blockbuster drug in its arsenal to immediately replace Zantac, the
British pharmaceutical company began looking for a merger partner
with some probable hit drugs in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   While copycat drug makers began marketing a generic version of
Zantac, Glaxo began talking late that year in earnest about merging
with SmithKline Beecham PLC, another British drug maker that had
the the pipeline Glaxo wanted. In it was a drug called Avandia, a
diabetes treatment with smash hit written all over it.
</P>
<P>
   The companies had qualities that complemented each other. Glaxo
had marketing resources and money to burn on research, and
SmithKline had a significant drug pipeline _ but neither company
had the size and scale to achieve the kind of success the two
companies could achieve together.
</P>
<P>
   Only one problem stood between the two drug makers: the egos of
the companies' top brass. Glaxo's chairman, Sir Richard Sykes and
SmithKline's chief executive, Jan Leschly, refused to merge,
because neither executive wanted to give up control of his drug
fiefdom.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, as Glaxo announced that it would acquire SmithKline
for about $76 billion in stock, both executives gave up the control
they so valued to a third man, Jean-Pierre Garnier. Garnier, the
chief operating officer of SmithKline will take the reins of the
newly anointed largest drug maker in the world, Glaxo SmithKline,
stepping into the role of chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Richard, 57, will become the nonexecutive chairman of the
combined company and may retire in 2002 when he turns 60, while
Leschly will leave the combined company entirely when he retires in
April.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Glaxo SmithKline did everything they could Monday
to quash the discussion about the bitter battle of egos that
prevented the companies from merging two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is today,'' Leschly said. ``What happened in the past is,
in reality, irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   While the previously collapsed merger talks may be irrelevant,
the summer of 1997, and Zantac's patent expiration, is clearly not.
It signaled the beginning of rampant consolidation within the
pharmaceutical industry as drug makers desperately sought _ and
continue to seek _ scale and size in an industry that is
fundamentally fractured. As the largest drug maker in the world,
Glaxo SmithKline will still control only 7.3 percent of the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   A major supporter of consolidation, Garnier, a Frenchman who is
a naturalized U.S. citizen, has been sitting in the shadow of
Leschly for more than five years waiting for this moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jean-Pierre always wanted control and he's been waiting
patiently,'' said James Culverwell, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in
London. ``He's an outstanding leader. Very impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Garnier has a challenging task ahead of him. The company pledged
Monday to achieve cost savings of $1.63 billion annually by the
third year of operation. More than costs, Garnier will have to
manage a trans-Atlantic work force of more than 100,000 people. And
most important, he needs to spend his $3.6 billion research and
development budget on discovering the dazzling drug before his
current roster of drugs have to compete with generic versions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Garnier will be stationed in the United States in a new
operational headquarters that the company plans to build somewhere
near New York, though the company has yet to settle on an exact
location. The company's corporate headquarters will remain in
London. Garnier said the drug maker would keep a second
headquarters in the United States because that is the company's
largest market.
</P>
<P>
   Garnier currently lives in a suburb of Philadelphia, near
SmithKline's U.S. headquarters. Glaxo's U.S. headquarters currently
is in Research Triangle Park, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Richard expressed his confidence in Garnier and his newly
appointed executive team, deflecting attention from himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here is a company with unbelievable financial
power,'' Sir Richard said. ``If there are opportunities to build
and drive on the business, we will look at those opportunities and
take advantage of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the right leadership team to move the business
forward,'' he said. ``We all believe this was the right thing to do
at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the executives did not acknowledge it, analysts said a
major incentive to merge was the announcement on Thursday by
Warner-Lambert that it was in talks with Pfizer over a possible
merger, upsetting an earlier agreement between Warner-Lambert and
American Home Products. If they do combine, Pfizer and
Warner-Lambert would rank second in the world behind a combined
Glaxo SmithKline.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last year we've seen so much consolidation. There is a
real pressure on drug companies to merge,'' Culverwell said.
``Glaxo and SmithKline are biting the bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all investors were thrilled that Glaxo and SmithKline had
decided to tie the knot. With the market expecting more cost
savings than the combined company pledged, shares of Glaxo dropped
4.7 percent, or 86 pence, to 1,732 pounds, and SmithKline fell 6.9
percent, or 58.5 pence, to 788.5 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Glaxo shareholders will get 58.75 percent
of the new company, while SmithKline shareholders will control
41.25 percent. SmithKline shareholders will get 0.4552 shares of
Glaxo SmithKline in exchange for each share of SmithKline that they
own. Glaxo shares will be exchanged on a one-for-one basis.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. stock markets were closed for the Martin Luther King
holiday. Glaxo's American depository receipts closed Friday at $60
and those of SmithKline were at $70.
</P>
<P>
   With combined annual revenue estimated at $25 billion, the new
company will surpass Aventis SA of Frankfurt, Germany, which was
created last year when Hoechst AG and Rhone-Poulenc SA merged, as
the world's No. 1 drug seller.
</P>
<P>
   Some jobs are likely to be cut from the combined company's
107,000 employees, though few of the nearly 22,000 jobs in the
United States are at risk, the companies said.

   AGUA PRIETA, Mexico _ U.S. Border Patrol agents have been
detaining so many Mexicans crossing the border illegally that when
they flushed the Guzman family and 20 other shivering migrants out
of the Arizona mesquite near here the week before last, they had to
fill out the forms sending them home by flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   They did the paperwork under the desert sky because the 1,410
undocumented immigrants rounded up that same night would not have
come close to fitting inside the nearest Border Patrol station at
Douglas, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1998, Agua Prieta, a gritty desert town that shares the
border with Douglas, has been the busiest border crossing area
along the 2,000-mile dividing line between Mexico and the United
States. And January is busy season here as thousands of
undocumented Mexicans have attempted to cross into Arizona since
the New Year's holidays, provoking detentions on an industrial
scale.
</P>
<P>
   Along the 26 miles of frontier stretching east and west from
here, the Border Patrol has already detained 14,664 undocumented
migrants this month, nearly twice as many as were detained during
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   The January rush for the border is part of a yearly cycle;
thousands of Mexicans who work illegally in the United States
travel south to spend the Christmas holidays in hometowns across
Mexico, and employers all across America are now waiting for them
to return. But this year is busier than usual because of the
booming economy up north.
</P>
<P>
   Enrique Guzman, 22, earned $50 a week running errands for a
congressman in Mexico City. But since a relative in Los Angeles
persuaded him he could earn eight times that as a construction
laborer in the U.S. economy, Guzman has been determined to reach
California. Not even his family's humiliating detention Jan. 12
changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll try again,'' Guzman said after agents released him, his
teen-aged wife and their baby boy back into Agua Prieta.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of migrants with the same idea loiter in Agua Prieta's
streets by day, awaiting their chance to make an illegal crossing.
Across a new steel-barred fence in Douglas, a once sleepy town of
15,000 residents, reinforcements have swelled Border Patrol ranks
to nearly 500 agents from two people in the early 1980s; it now
rivals the school district as the largest employer. Hundreds of
Patrol vehicles prowl the streets, helicopters clatter overhead,
and stadium floodlights illuminate the border fence like the walls
of a prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Douglas has become a garrison for a federal force fighting an
immigration war,'' said Ray Borane, the town mayor, who wrote
letters to Bill Clinton and Al Gore recently asking them to rethink
border policy.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas-Agua Prieta became ground zero in the conflict over
worker migration because the Clinton administration has beefed up
the Border Patrol to more than 9,000 agents from fewer than 4,000
agents in the mid-1990s, and deployed many of them to detain
illegal crossers in the border's largest cities.
</P>
<P>
   Demographers say the crackdown has not slowed the river of
humanity crossing the southwest border, but it has rechanneled it.
In 1993 nine out of 10 undocumented migrants crossed at border
cities. Today, two out of three cross in remote areas like Agua
Prieta.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bach, associate commissioner at the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said the toughened policies have reduced
the chaos in border cities like San Diego, where crowds of migrants
used to run through residents' yards and across freeways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want a labor market that plays by the rules,'' he said.
``Nobody says we've controlled the whole border. But we're
accomplishing that piece by piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Rechanneling the flow into remote areas has made it more
dangerous, however. Migrants now die in greater numbers than
previously, of thirst, hunger, sunstroke, or cold. Others drown in
irrigation canals. According to Mexican government figures, 717
undocumented Mexicans have died trying to cross the border since
1995.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel for these aliens,'' said Larry Vance, an employee of a
Douglas utility company, recounting how several Mexicans have been
run down by cars near his 20-acre property a mile north of the
international line. Anger overwhelms his sympathies, however,
because mobs of migrants cross his land each day, bending his
fences and dumping diapers and empty water jugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Border Patrol is nothing more than a speed bump for these
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan, who is advocating tougher border controls in his
pursuit of the Reform Party's presidential nomination, is scheduled
to meet with Vance when he visits Douglas on Wednesday. But illegal
immigration is not the explosive issue it has been in past
presidential campaigns, apparently because America's economic boom
has created labor shortages.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Never has the United States spent so much to keep undocumented
workers out, nor the economy needed them more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexican immigrants are filling niches that employers can't
even try to fill with American workers,'' said Wayne Cornelius,
director of the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies at the
University of California at San Diego. ``So even though migrants
must expose themselves to life-threatening hazards, they'll keep
trying until they get across. Economically, that's still their most
rational option.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Jan. 3 editorial, The Denver Post criticized a crackdown on
migrants by the INS in Colorado, arguing that ``undocumented
foreigners are keeping our strong economy afloat.'' The paper urged
policy-makers to allow some Mexicans to work in the United States
legally.
</P>
<P>
   Similar proposals are gaining strength south of the border.
Francisco Labastida, the presidential candidate of Mexico's
governing party, said he would press for a new, expanded bracero
program, which half a century ago gave Mexicans legal, temporary
jobs in the United States.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But for now, people here are learning to live with the arriving
masses of undocumented workers. Businessmen have converted dozens
of Agua Prieta clinics, auto shops and stores into makeshift
hotels, charging $25 to $40 for a bed and hot shower.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you the most lucrative illegal contraband here now
is not drugs, but people,'' said Efrain Martinez, Agua Prieta's
city manager.
</P>
<P>
   Some migrants grow despondent. In October, a man who had been
turned back five times at the border began hurling himself in front
of traffic in Agua Prieta. After police arrested him, he hung
himself in his jail cell.
</P>
<P>
   Yet every evening after sundown, thousands of Mexicans march
east and west out of Agua Prieta in columns, some 100 or more
people long, led by professional guides. Miles out in the Mexican
desert, they head north over the international line, seeking to
rendezvous with vans hired to ferry them to Phoenix or Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting to intercept them one recent night was supervisory
Border Patrol agent Fred Esquivel. Parking his truck along a
railroad trestle, he scanned the horizon with an infrared camera
allowing him to peer through the Arizona darkness as though it were
high noon. Within minutes, he identified six columns of migrants
moving across his screen, their heads bobbing above shoulder-high
sagebrush. His radio crackled with a dispatcher's chatter as ozens
of Patrol agents swarmed along the borderline, detaining hundreds
of Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to sympathize with these people,'' Esquivel said,
small-talking through the night. ``They're coming from nothing, and
they've got nothing to lose. They'll try again and again to get
across. I'd do the same thing if I were in their shoes.''

<P>
   Three familiar names have swept the most prestigious awards for
children's literature.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Paul Curtis won the John Newbery Medal for ``Bud,
Not Buddy''. Curtis' first novel, ``The Watsons Go to Birmingham _
1963'', had been named a Newbery Honor Book for 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Simms Taback received the Randolph Caldecott Medal, given for
best picture book, for ``Joseph Had a Little Overcoat''. Taback is
also a previous Honor Book winner.
</P>
<P>
   And Walter Dean Myers, among the best-known and most-feted
authors of books for older children, won the first Michael L.
Printz Award for his novel ``Monster''. This new prize honors
excellence in young-adult literature.
</P>
<P>
   The awards, given annually by the American Library Association,
were announced Monday at the group's midwinter meeting in San
Antonio, Texas. The Newbery and Caldecott Medals honor outstanding
writing and illustration in works published in the United States
during the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bud, Not Buddy'', published by Delacorte, is set in the
Depression era and tells the story of a 10-year-old boy who leaves
the orphanage where he has lived since his mother's death and
embarks on a quest to find the father he never met, apparently a
jazz band leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``This heartfelt novel resonates with both zest and tenderness
as it entertains questions of racism, belonging, love and hope,''
said Carolyn S. Brodie, chair of the Newbery Award Selection
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Houston Chronicle reviewer Marvin Hoffman said, ``As
in his previous book, Curtis manages to introduce his readers to a
lot of significant history while he keeps them laughing and
guessing. We learn about the ubiquitous soup kitchens of the 1930s,
the huge numbers of homeless wanderers who roamed the country in
search of work and gathered in communities called Hoovervilles, the
dangerous union-organizing efforts focused on black Pullman-car
porters ... and the rich black music scene in the hinterlands,
where people sought relief from the crushing hard times.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis worked for 13 years on a General Motors assembly line in
Flint, Mich., before finding success with ``The Watsons Go to
Birmingham _ 1963''.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Newbery, Curtis won this year's Coretta Scott
King Author Award, recognizing excellence by African-American
writers. Honored with a King award for illustration was Brian
Pinkney, illustrator of ``In the Time of the Drums'' (Hyperion).
</P>
<P>
   Three Newbery Honor Books were named: ``Getting Near to Baby'',
by Audrey Couloumbis (Putnam); ``26 Fairmount Avenue'', written and
illustrated by Tomie dePaola (Putnam); and ``Our Only May Amelia'',
by Jennifer L. Holm (HarperCollins).
</P>
<P>
   Taback's Caldecott-winning ``Joseph Had a Little Overcoat'',
published by Viking, is based on a Yiddish folk tale about a
resourceful tailor who transforms his worn overcoat into smaller
and smaller garments. The book is illustrated in watercolor,
gouache, pencil, ink and collage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The patchwork layout of the pages, the two-dimensional
paintings and the exaggerated perspectives reminiscent of the
folk-art tradition are the fabric that turns this overcoat into a
story,'' said Caldecott Award Selection Committee chair Barbara Z.
Kiefer.
</P>
<P>
   Taback has worked as an art director and graphic designer and
has taught at the School of Visual Arts at Syracuse University. He
has illustrated many children's books, including ``I Know an Old
Lady Who Swallowed a Fly'' (Honor Book for 1997), ``Spacey
Riddles'', ``When I First Came to This Land'' and ``Where Is My
Baby?''
</P>
<P>
   Caldecott Honor Books are: ``Sector 7'', illustrated and written
by David Weisner (Clarion Books); ``The Ugly Duckling'', adapted
and illustrated by Jerry Pinkney based on a fairy tale by Hans
Christian Andersen (Morrow); ``When Sophie Gets Angry _ Really,
Really Angry'', illustrated and written by Molly Bang (Scholastic);
and ``A Child's Calendar'', illustrated by Trina Schart Hyman,
written by John Updike (Holiday House).
</P>
<P>
   Myers' ``Monster'', published by HarperCollins, tells the story
of Steve Harmon, a 16-year-old black teen-ager implicated in a
store holdup in which the proprietor was shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is particularly skillful in Myers' handling of the story
is that, even when the (courtroom) decision is announced, we are
left to ponder ambiguities and to harbor questions about what
really happened and about the meaning of the `monster' label with
which Steve was branded early on,'' said the Chronicle's Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   Printz Honor Books are ``Hard Love'', by Ellen Wittlinger (Simon
&AMP; Schuster); ``Skellig'', by David Almond (Delacorte); and
``Speak'', by Laurie Halse Anderson (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux).
</P>
<P>
   The Pura Belpre Award, honoring Latino writers and illustrators
whose work best portrays and celebrates Latino experience, went to
illustrator Carmen Lomas Garza for ``Magic Windows: Cut-Paper Art
and Stories'' (Children's Book Press) and author Alma Flor Ada for
``Under the Royal Palms: A Childhood in Cuba'' (Atheneum).

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the waiting room of Dr. Mark Fromer's office in
Trump Tower _ not so long ago filled with elderly patients seeking
treatment for cataract disease _ young professionals with expensive
haircuts whisper into cell phones as they wait for their 15-minute
laser eye surgery appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Patients at the SoHo Integrative Health Center in Manhattan can
see Dr. Laurie Polis, the center's dermatologist, for a routine
skin cancer check, then get the wrinkles in their forehead zapped.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Irwin Smigel, a prominent Manhattan dentist, passes people
needing routine fillings on to his associates; he is far too busy
applying the latest tooth-whitening concoction on his patients.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, doctors who specialized in so-called lifestyle
medicine _ elective and largely cosmetic procedures _ were limited
to rarefied corners of the medical profession. But facing declining
revenues because of reimbursement cuts by managed-care companies,
thousands of doctors in New York and across the country are turning
to cosmetic medicine to keep their practices lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple: Because nearly every elective procedure
intended to improve the appearance of a patient is not paid for by
insurance companies, patients must pay up front, often staggering
sums. Laser eye surgery, for instance, costs about $5,000. For
doctors, that means no rejected bills, no paperwork and no reduced
payments by managed-care companies.
</P>
<P>
   In some practices, cosmetic procedures are supplementing basic
care; in others, they are nearly replacing it.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 10 years, fees for many medical procedures dropped
significantly because of third-party payers, said Timothy J.
Murphy, chief executive of QVS Technology Group, a health care
consulting firm in Des Plaines, Ill., that helps doctors set up
alternatives to their usual business. ``And when doctors lost
that,'' he said, ``like any red-blooded American, they thought to
themselves, `What am I going to do here?'''
</P>
<P>
   And with a strong economy, there seems to be no shortage of
deep-pocketed consumers who feel their lives will be enhanced by
having fewer wrinkles, perpetually hairless legs and a face free of
cumbersome eyeglasses. In turn, explosions in technology have made
many of these aesthetic procedures more exacting and easier to
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Elective procedures make up nearly 25 percent of many medical
practices like plastic surgery and dermatology in urban areas,
experts in the field said, up from 10 percent five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is led by laser eye surgery, which in just a few years
has transformed ophthalmology; in the last two years alone, the
number of Americans who underwent laser eye surgery to correct
their vision problems increased more than 500 percent, and doctors
who do the procedure are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars
marketing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in a host of other medical specialties are also joining
aesthetics with medicine: Dermatologists, especially in major
cities, are prescribing more Botox injections for wrinkles than
they are acne medicines, and many are selling anti-aging creams and
other beauty products in their offices. Dentists are using the
latest in super-whitening techniques. And even
obstetrician-gynecologists are offering laser hair removal to their
patients.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction of cosmetic medicine, with its fee-for-service
payment structure and high demand, may mean that many doctors will
now shun more basic but less lucrative procedures like general eye
care and reconstructive surgery for accident victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you will find is that the supply of the low-profit
services will decline,'' said Dr. David Friend, a health care
management consultant with Watson Wyatt Worldwide in Boston. ``The
result is a tiering effect, where the best doctors are doing the
private stuff and doctors unable to succeed in those things will
provide the public service care. We have created an incentive for
everyone who can to get out of low-margin businesses, and that
could have enormous policy implications.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alan R. Kling, who has a dermatologic and cosmetic surgery
practice on Park Avenue, said that he is one such doctor. ``There
are certain cases that I am not doing anymore,'' Kling said, citing
complicated cancer surgeries for which he said insurance companies
reimburse him only $100, much less than the cost to him.
</P>
<P>
   Kling, whose hold music on his telephone is a running ad for
liposuction and skin injections, said that in 1996, things like
liposuction and Botox accounted for only 5 percent of his business.
Now, they are closer to 25 percent. ``It used to be when people who
came out of school wanted to do cosmetics, they were looked down
on,'' he said. ``At Harvard, they called it `throwing the pearls to
the swine.' Now, in terms of survival, it is what you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Fromer, the ophthalmologist, said that five years ago, the core
of his business was retina surgery and general ophthalmology. Now,
90 percent is laser eye surgery. He also points to economics. In
the early 1990s, he said, Medicare would pay him $3,000 to $3,500
for cataract surgery, but now he receives $750 to $2,000 per case.
``I would describe laser as the thing that allows me to offer
general care to my patients,'' Fromer said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, deciding to offer procedures that cater to
vain, stressed- out or just very wealthy patients is not a simple
matter of buying new equipment and adding another line to a Yellow
Pages ad. Doctors find that they have to overhaul their entire
practices, from the way their receptionists answer the phone to the
couches patients sit on to the length of time they make them wait
for an appointment.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And they often spend thousands of dollars on advertising: Listen
to AM radio for an hour and you might think the only things for
sale in America are laser eye surgery and auto insurance.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The demographics for these procedures is much younger, maybe
30 to 55 years old,'' said Murphy of QVS Technology Group. ``You
have to treat them differently than a 70-year-old patient trying to
get an appointment because they can't see.''
</P>
<P>
   ```I'll see if we can fit you in in three weeks' won't work with
the McDonald's society who wants it hot, wants in now and wants it
cheap,'' he said. ``The staff has to give high-class treatment. We
compare it to the airline industry: There is a difference between
the first-class cabin and the back of the bus.''
</P>
<P>
   Fromer said that he gave his office one such face lift. The
furniture and waiting room are turned out in subtle, tasteful
tones. The equipment is sleek and spotless, as though it just fell
off a space ship. Patients recovering from their surgery rest in
reclining chairs, covered in soft cotton blankets. His office
employees look as though they would fit in quite well behind the
counter of an upscale gym.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``When a patient walks through the door,'' he said, ``they have
to see that the doctor has done this before, that the equipment is
top-notch and the office has to be extremely friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the SoHo Integrative Health Center, atmosphere is taken to
the highest level. Patients see an array of specialists on one
floor, including an obstetrician-gynecologist, ophthalmologist and
internist, and can get their facials, massages, nutritional therapy
and Eastern medicine by climbing a winding staircase, past the
slate waterfall. (Dr. Polis, who runs the center, sent back the
slate once when it was not to her satisfaction.)
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes coming to the doctor feel more like self care,'' Dr.
Polis said. ``So if you include a massage, well, that is self care,
too. There is no need to compare the importance of a Pap smear with
a facial.''
</P>
<P>
   This medical mall of sorts _ where the plain vanilla medical
needs can be matched with aesthetic desires all under the same
elegant fabric-covered roof _ is driven by consumer demand, she
said. ``Those doctors who resist the trends in the way they deliver
medicine are not in tune to their patients' needs.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When money cannot be made in procedures alone, there are
products that can be sold. Dozens of businesses have opened across
the country in recent years to provide dermatologists with skin
care products. Often, the preparations they sell are similar to
those sold in department stores, only at a higher strength.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven J. Pearlman, the director of the Division of Facial
Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital
Center in New York, sells alpha-hydroxy creams to prevent skin
aging, and bleaching creams for brown spots. ``They make up for
overhead,'' he said, declining to specify his exact profit margin.
</P>
<P>
   Offering skin care products and substituting a lot of the ear,
nose, throat and cancer-related surgeries he used to do with
cosmetic procedures has given his practice a whole new lease on
life, Pearlman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With medical things, first you have to fulfill numerous
requirements, like getting precertified,'' he said. ``You get paid
way later and have generated a load of paperwork. With cosmetic
things, it is, `Nice to meet you, here is the procedure, let's do
it or not do it.' It is how medicine used to be.''

EPA EXPANDS PROBE OF ASBESTOS-TAINTED ORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIBBY, Mont. _ The Environmental Protection Agency is expanding
its investigation of asbestos-related death and illness from a
vermiculite mine near here to include sites across the nation that
received the tainted ore.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported last month that over the
past 40 years, millions of pounds of the ore were shipped from the
northwestern Montana mine to at least 60 processing plants
throughout the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The P-I documented that workers at many of those plants became
ill and died from exposure to asbestos-tainted ore, and that the
W.R. Grace Co. and the Zonolite Co., the first owner of the
vermiculite mine, kept information about the lethal nature of the
tremolite asbestos fibers from the men expanding and processing the
brownish-pink ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious that people died from exposure to the ore in
Libby, and ... it is only logical to examine whether a danger still
exists at the plants around the country that processed the same
ore,'' says Paul Perdnard, EPA's on-scene coordinator heading up
the Libby investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Later Tuesday, Perdnard's boss, Max Dodson, the assistant
administrator of EPA's regional office in Denver, will hold the
first of what he says will be weekly telephone conferences with his
counterparts in other .
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Dodson contacted Superfund and emergency response
managers in all 10 EPA regional offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that ... coordination of EPA's investigation of other
processing plants is critical at this juncture,'' Dodson wrote in a
memo to his counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The findings of these investigations can have serious policy
and resource implications for the agency,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   EPA's national response to asbestos problems is chaotic at best
and varies dramatically from region to region when it comes to
deciding what actions if any should be taken to resolve a problem.
However, Dodson says he's confident the agency will take needed
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at these expansion-plant sites as potential public
health problems that could be covered under (Superfund) statutes.
If we find a problem, I'm sure the agency will respond
appropriately,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has asked Grace to supply additional information on
the plants, additional locations and quantities processed, Dodson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Perdnard says that his team is collecting names of additional
sites across the country that processed the vermiculite from Libby.
</P>
<P>
   Grace closed the Libby mine in 1990 and says it shipped the last
of the ore in 1993. Some of the processing facilities are still in
operation, using ore from Grace's remaining vermiculite mine in
South Carolina. Grace says that vermiculite from that mine is not
tainted with asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not saying that there is any health hazard remaining at
these plants that Grace and the others used,'' Perdnard says, ``but
it's worth the effort just to check and see if any large quantities
of the contaminated ore remain at these sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Dodson and Perdnard say that some of the regional Superfund
managers may want to wait until the preliminary studies at Libby
are available.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the EPA team, working with Montana state health
officials and the Public Health Service, has completed testing on
35 homes in Libby that are insulated with Zonolite or expanded
vermiculite from the old mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've monitored the air in these homes and have taken soil
samples from their gardens, yards and driveways,'' Perdnard says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've also done the road going up to the mine, the export
plant and the railroad loading station. We should have the initial
results on this first testing by early February.''
</P>
<P>
   The frigid Montana winter is making the testing difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have seen our teams using ice picks to collect
samples,'' Perdnard says, and adds that much of the more telling
testing to determine whether dangerous levels of asbestos still
imperil the town cannot be accomplished until the spring thaw.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the P-I first reported that asbestos from the mine
on a mountain near Libby that opened in 1924 had killed more than
192 people and left at least 375 with fatal diseases. The series of
stories showed that Grace, the Zonolite Co. before it and
government regulators ignored the signs of widespread asbestos
contamination that doctors say will be killing people for many
years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Hard freeze or not, more experts are joining the EPA team in
Libby.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, health experts from the Agency for Toxic
Substances and Disease Registry in Atlanta are expected to arrive
in Libby to help sort out the specific hazards of the asbestos
fibers that contaminate the vermiculite.
</P>
<P>
   Tremolite, the rare asbestos found in Libby's ore, is one of the
least studied of the six known asbestos fibers. Some doctors who
have worked with patients whose cancer or asbestosis is blamed on
tremolite, say the thin, needlelike shape of the tremolite fiber
makes it one of the most lethal. Other doctors disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gathered this panel of experts to review the information
as we collected it and offer up opinions,'' Perdnard says. ``Libby
and the people in the town who are sick and dying will offer a real
time laboratory that can help us determine how hazardous this
tremolite really is.''
</P>
<P>
   EPA's response to the tremolite contamination in Libby has been
immediate and comprehensive. Elsewhere, the agency is being
criticized for its handling of tremolite contamination from a stone
processing operation in Sparta, New Jersey and a county where new
homes are being constructed in an area of naturally occurring
tremolite in the El Dorado area near Sacramento. Calif.

<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Even though Steve Forbes has been dismissed
as a realistic presidential contender by most political pundits,
the Forbes campaign continues its seemingly never-ending swing
through Iowa, filled with the enthusiastic belief that one day, if
the breaks just fall its way, Forbes might actually occupy the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes himself peppers his standard stump speech, which has not
varied in months, with phrases like ``as your commander-in-chief''
and ``when I am president,'' and his hard-core followers reward him
with standing ovations and murmured amens.
</P>
<P>
   From now until the Jan. 24 caucuses, Forbes is leading a highly
visible and heavily orchestrated bus tour of Iowa, drumming up
support in the one state where he has a shot at a fairly
respectable showing. That, of course, is because Sen. John McCain
of Arizona has decided not to compete here, making Forbes a virtual
shoo-in for the No. 2 spot behind the Republican front-runner, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes needs a strong showing in Iowa to propel him into New
Hampshire. And to that end, his legendary organizational prowess
and lavish spending are on display as his two-bus cavalcade,
blaring Willie Nelson tunes, pulls into small towns. Forbes, a
gawky but effective speaker, and his entourage put on a spectacle
filled with power-point presentations, a plea for followers to
create a ``family and friends'' network of additional supporters,
and plenty of free food and gifts.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   No one goes away empty-handed or unfed. Gifts include a copy of
Forbes' book, a 15-minute biographical video, a bright orange
long-sleeved T-shirt with the campaign logo to wear on caucus
night, a blue computer mouse pad emblazoned with his name, campaign
buttons, campaign literature and a list of caucus sites in every
Iowa neighborhood. And wherever Forbes goes, the crowd is typically
already seated at tables where chili and potato soup, turkey
sandwiches and vegetable soup, individual crocks of cheese soup or,
in one case, a pork dinner, have been served.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is so organized that at each stop two young men
rush out of the bus before Forbes, carrying American and Iowa flags
to set up on the podium, where a huge Forbes sign already hangs.
Those who attend have either been called directly by the Forbes
campaign or drawn by an advertisement in the local newspaper or on
local radio. When they sit down, a packet of Forbes information
identifying their caucus site is already at their seat.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Crowds of 100 to 300 greeted Forbes at each stop on a recent
two-day Iowa swing, many saying they were little concerned that
Forbes' chances of winning are slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is a sure thing in Iowa to my way of thinking,'' said
Don Hahn, a retired farmer in Keota.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Stockland, an assistant manager of a grocery store in
Washington, Iowa, said: ``I like what he says about the family and
the flat tax, and I don't care what anyone else thinks. You are
supposed to vote for who you think is the best, no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Lorna Shepherd, an Ainsworth farmer: ``I don't vote to be
part of a bandwagon, I got to like what I hear. That's why we have
the caucuses.''
</P>
<P>
   What is particularly surprising about Forbes is how little his
basic stump speech has changed in months of campaigning, and how
highly programmed his presentations are. Even his jokes do not
vary. His reference to ``the Infernal, oops, I mean Internal
Revenue Service'' is a consistent laugh-getter.
</P>
<P>
   This consistency and these traditional themes are what his
followers have come to hear: a presentation against abortion, in
favor of a flat income tax and in favor of more choices in
education, health care and Social Security investments. He
continues to play the role of Washington outsider _ ``Washington
special interests have no hooks in me'' _ and he puts down the tax
plans of Bush and McCain, whom he refers to as the ``timid twins on
taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   For his campaigns, Forbes has spent $62 million from his own
fortune of over $400 million: $25 million in 1999 and $37 million
in his 1996 bid. In Iowa, that money has been used to set up a
powerful organization for a caucus competition, one in which a
strong organization often matters more than a winning message.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has 4,000 caucus captains in the state's 99 precincts and
has identified 88,000 ``Forbes-friendly'' households. Those
captains, along with everyone else who attends Forbes' appearances,
are being asked to bring five people each on caucus night and are
given cards to identify them to the Forbes campaign. Around 100,000
of the state's 500,000 Republicans typically attend the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is for Forbes to do better than he did in the Iowa
straw poll last August, when he received 20 percent of the vote to
Bush's 31 percent. (The rest was scattered over 10 other
candidates, with Elizabeth Dole, who has since dropped out,
finishing third, with 14 percent of the vote.)
</P>
<P>
   The core of Forbes' support is made up of social and economic
conservatives: the Christian right of the party and those who want
less government and lower taxes. But to succeed, Forbes has to go
beyond that and gain a share of Iowa's undecided vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of undecided,'' said Steve Grubbs, former
chairman of the Iowa Republican Party and head of the Forbes Iowa
campaign, ``and we've got to have those undecided break our way on
caucus night.''
</P>
<P>
   The view from the Forbes campaign is that Forbes needs a strong
showing in Iowa to give him momentum for the New Hampshire primary
just eight days later. ``We don't have to win,'' Grubbs said. ``Our
job in Iowa is to get Steve Forbes to New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked how much of the Iowa vote Forbes needed, Grubbs said,
``South of 20 percent, he goes wounded. We need to be north of 20
percent, there's no doubt about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Most local polls show Forbes taking around 20 percent of the
Iowa vote.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all the campaign ebullience, there is a defensiveness
over Forbes' low standing in polls and his dismissal by the
political establishment. One piece of campaign literature
distributed at all Forbes events says: ``With George W. Bush
weakening in the early states _ and John McCain unprepared to run a
full 50-state presidential campaign _ Steve Forbes is now in a
position to surprise everyone and win the GOP. nomination. That's
what the media isn't telling you.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the Forbes rhetoric about bold ideas, it often seems
that he is not so much running for president as he is running to
stop Bush, whom Forbes portrays as a latecomer to his anti-tax
crusade, though in a weaker form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that Bush is the front-runner, he's trying to portray
himself as a tax cutter,'' Forbes said, seated in his campaign bus
one dark Iowa night. ``I'm delighted that others are beginning to
evolve to where I am. Bush will have a fight on his hands and it
will be a long one. He tried to shut us down at the straw poll and
it did not work. I'm in for the duration. The Republican Party
wants to anoint Bush, but I don't think they will be able to pull
off their coronation.''

SPANISH JUDGE SEEKS 2ND EXAM FOR PINOCHET 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ After a weekend of suspense, the Spanish
government Monday sent to the British government a judge's petition
that seeks a second medical examination of Gen. Augusto Pinochet to
determine if earlier tests wrongly declared him unfit to stand
trial for human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Baltasar Garzon, who is leading the effort to have the
former Chilean dictator extradited for trial in Spain, submitted
the document to the government Friday, but received no assurance
that it would be sent to London by Tuesday, the deadline set by the
British government for comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's detention in Britain for the last 15 months has
strained relations between Spain and Chile, and the Spanish
government had said it would send on Garzon's document only if it
added something new to the case. Over the weekend, the government
found a diplomatic way out.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Spanish government, there is nothing new in the
case,'' said Jose Luis Solano, a Foreign Ministry spokesman. ``But
Judge Garzon says there are new elements.''
</P>
<P>
   The government reiterated that it would not appeal any decision
by British Home Secretary Jack Straw, who said last week that he
was inclined to end the extradition proceedings and release General
Pinochet because a medical examination in Britain on Jan. 5 found
him unfit to stand trial.

WHITE HOUSE SEEKS $280 MILLION TO ENFORCE EXISTING GUN LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House will ask Congress for $280 million
in new spending to enforce existing gun control laws, a strategy
intended to address one of the main complaints of those who oppose
gun restrictions, administration officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton plans to announce the spending proposal, which
will be part of his 2001 budget submission, at an appearance in
Boston on Tuesday. The new spending, which is subject to
congressional approval, would be used to hire more gun
investigators and prosecutors, foster development of so-called
smart-gun technology, improve the government's ballistics testing
program and begin an anti-gun news media campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint appearance with Attorney General Janet Reno and local
law-enforcement officials, Clinton will also hail new Justice
Department figures showing a 25 percent increase between 1998 and
1999 in the number of firearms cases brought by federal
prosecutors. The number of such cases rose to 5,500 last year, from
4,391 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The boost in financing and the release of the new data are
intended to counter one of the major arguments advanced by the
National Rifle Association and other critics of gun control laws:
that new gun restrictions are not needed because scores of existing
laws are rarely enforced.
</P>
<P>
   ``These numbers should put to rest once and for all the gun
lobby's phony contention that the government is not enforcing the
existing laws,'' said Bruce Reed, the White House domestic policy
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is planning to propose a 20 percent staffing increase at
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, adding 300 agents and
200 firearms inspectors, officials said. The agents will focus on
violent gun criminals and illegal gun traffickers, while the
inspectors will target ``unscrupulous gun dealers that supply guns
to criminals and juveniles,'' a White House fact sheet said.
</P>
<P>
   The president will also recommend tripling the spending for the
development of a national ballistics database. At a cost of $30
million, the database, the National Integrated Ballistics
Information Network, will link the firearms identification computer
files operated by the ATF and the FBI. Within two years, 230 local
and state law enforcement agencies are expected to have access to
the system.
</P>
<P>
   To prosecute violators, the president's budget will also provide
financing for more than 1,000 new federal, state and local
prosecutors. A new $150 million program will provide grants to
state and local governments to hire gun prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association reacted cautiously to the
administration's plans, embracing the focus on existing laws while
repeating its opposition to new gun legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad that the Clinton administration agrees with the NRA
that enforcing the federal firearms laws is a good thing to do,''
said James Baker, the rifle association's chief lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Along with increased spending, Clinton will announce proposals
in his State of the Union address next week to limit sales at gun
shows, require safety locks for handguns, ban the importation of
large-capacity ammunition clips and ban violent juveniles from
owning guns for life. Clinton proposed similar measures last year,
without success.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said, ``We'll continue to keep the pressure on Congress to
finish the job and pass the gun bill that has been tied up in a
conference committee since last summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The climate for such gun control bills is not expected to
improve markedly from last year, analysts say, despite high-profile
school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress won't touch some of these measures with a 10-foot
pole,'' said Mark Pertschuk, legislative director for the Coalition
to Stop Gun Violence, based in Washington. ``But there is a modest
chance that we can bring up some of these issues, like the gun show
loophole.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration proposals to impose strict restrictions on
firearms sales at gun shows were a source of bitter division in
Congress last year.
</P>
<P>
   Also last year, Clinton failed to win approval of a $4 million
program to develop smart-gun technology that would allow only the
owner of a gun to fire it. The president will try again in his 2001
budget proposal, aides said. He will propose $10 million in federal
spending to spur development of the technology, which is intended
to prevent accidental shootings and deter gun theft.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department figures to be released on Tuesday show
that the number of prosecutions has risen 16 percent _ up from
4,754 _ since 1992, presidential aides said. The length of the
average sentence for gun violators has also risen, to eight years
in 1999, from six years in 1992.

GOVERNMENT REFUSES TO DEAL WITH OCALAN ON KURDISH ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Now that the condemned Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan has been assured that he will not be hanged, at
least for the moment, he wants to take part in the incipient
national dialogue about how Turkey should deal with its Kurdish
minority.
</P>
<P>
   But Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit has declared that Ocalan can
have no role in that dialogue, and he has urged Ocalan to hold his
tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ocalan and his supporters are trying to dictate to the Turkish
government, and they are making statements with this aim,'' Ecevit
told a news conference. ``This is unacceptable. It would be to his
advantage to keep quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Ecevit announced that his government had decided not
to carry out the death sentence given to Ocalan after he was
convicted of treason in June. Ecevit said the government would wait
until the European Court of Human Rights had ruled on Ocalan's
appeal, which is most likely to take at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians and relatives of soldiers killed while fighting
Ocalan's guerrillas protested the decision. But most Turks seemed
to agree, albeit reluctantly, that it was in the national interest.
Turkey is a candidate for membership in the European Union, and
European leaders strongly oppose the death penalty. They have made
clear that Turkey's prospects for membership will be set back if
Ocalan is executed.
</P>
<P>
   After the decision to postpone the execution had been announced,
Ocalan (pronounced OH-ja-lan) issued a statement through his
lawyers. He called on the government to offer an amnesty to members
of his Kurdistan Workers Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is said that if they execute me the E.U. candidacy, the
economy and prospects for peace would all suffer,'' he said. ``It
is true that all of these depend on my staying alive. I am a
synthesis of values, not just a person. I represent democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ocalan led what was originally a separatist uprising,
in his statement he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a separatist. I have distanced myself from historical
mistakes committed in the past. Now I am settling on the idea of
unity based on freedom. That is what I am fighting for. We are
loyal and respectful toward the unity of the state and nation, but
on the basis of democracy. If we are to reach peace, there is an
urgent need for reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not be selfish, blind and unjust. We have to learn
to be constructive. We have to trust and value each other. The
healing must be done together, and we must see our differences as
the strength of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   But after a 15-year insurgency, few Turks are ready to accept
the idea that Ocalan could become a political figure. Many consider
him a terrorist and find it outrageous that he would presume to
portray himself as a democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Government leaders are acutely aware that the public consensus
that favors a postponement of execution is very fragile. They want
to avoid anything that might upset it, and evidently fear that his
statements might do so.
</P>
<P>
   Since his arrest nearly a year ago, Ocalan has been calling for
reconciliation and asking his guerrillas to lay down their weapons.
Fighting has died down considerably, and several prominent
politicians have urged the government to take a new approach to
Kurdish issues.
</P>
<P>
   But none has been so bold as to suggest that Ocalan could play a
role in shaping Turkey's political future. That idea remains an
absolute taboo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot allow Ocalan to use Imrali as a political pulpit,''
Ecevit said, referring to the island prison where he is being held.
``Imrali is not a podium for speeches. Ocalan has taken to issuing
statements from there through his lawyers. I want to stress that
the Turkish government cannot tolerate this.''

ISRAELI-SYRIAN TALKS ARE POSTPONED INDEFINITELY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Repeats 1st Take and adds 2nd Take)  
(sw) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a setback for the Israeli-Syrian peace talks
that was precipitated by a Syrian demand that its major negotiating
point be settled immediately, the Clinton administration announced
on Monday that the resumption of the negotiations had been
postponed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The administration was careful not to blame either side, saying
in a deliberately worded statement by Secretary of State, Madeleine
Albright that ``their approaches to the next round differ, and as a
result, there is going to be a delay'' in the talks set for
Wednesday at Shephardstown, W. Va.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the
Syrian foreign minister, Farouk al-Shara, coming as expected, both
sides would send experts to Washington to ``provide their
comments'' on the draft peace treaty written by the United States,
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official downplayed the seriousness of
the snag, saying that instead of having the two negotiators come to
the United States and ``dig in,'' it was judged that it would be
more productive to wait.
</P>
<P>
   The administration set no public time line for new talks, but
officials suggested they would be working feverishly behind the
scenes to keep momentum and resolve the problem of how to deal with
each side's determination to have their positions dealt with first.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has gone out of its way to try and solve each
side's major issues simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   The resumption of the talks unraveled Sunday when the Syrian
media announced that Israel must make its withdrawal from the Golan
Heights to the line of June 4, 1967, the eve of the Six Day War,
the first order of business in the new round.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, this Syrian demand was made in response to the leaking
in the Israeli press last week of the American draft peace treaty,
diplomats said. The draft was interpreted in the Arab world as
Syria making big concessions _ including the normalization of
relations with Israel and allowing an early warning ground station
on Mount Hermon on the Golan Heights _ without Syria winning a
major concession from the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Another complicating factor for the Syrians was the fact that
the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, has been long scheduled to
see President Clinton at the White House on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrians did not relish languishing in Shephardstown, W. Va.,
while Arafat, hardly a real friend of the Syrian leader, Hafez
Assad, was feted at the White House, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak added another negative factor for the Syrians by
suggesting that he would meet with Arafat and Clinton in
Washington, leaving the Syrians even further out in the cold.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the Syrian and Israeli capitals, the two governments reacted
to the postponement with degrees of defiance.
</P>
<P>
   A Syrian official in Damascus was quoted by Reuters as saying:
``The return of the Golan is not a matter for bargaining of
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, Barak said: ``It is impossible to threaten us. If
it isn't comfortable for the Syrians to come now, and they need
some time, they should take some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials had predicted that the appearance of
their draft peace treaty in Ha'aretz, a daily Israeli newspaper,
last week would make their job more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, a telephone conversation between Clinton and
Assad at the end of last week went quite well. But after that,
Albright and Dennis Ross, the main American negotiator, made a
series of phone calls to Barak and Shara over the weekend and on
Monday to try to keep the talks on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge facing the Clinton administration, according to a
senior official, is to devise a formula that gives both sides
assurances that their primary needs will be met in a way that
satisfies their domestic audiences. Giving such assurances was hard
in advance of negotiations, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   For the Israeli government, the uppermost concern is the depth
of security guarantees that Israel will receive in return for
giving up the Golan Heights. Barak has insisted that Israel cannot
agree on a border with Syria until it knows what security
guarantees Damascus and Washington will provide.
</P>
<P>
   Successive Israeli prime ministers have told the Israeli people
that Israel would not allow Syria to regain a position on the Sea
of Galilee, a central demand of the Syrians. Assad, who runs his
country with a dictatorial fist, has insisted to his people that
Israel must give up the entire Golan Heights to the line that
existed before the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official who briefed reporters on Monday
said that as negotiations edged closer to making the ``big
decision,'' it was not a surprise that each side would say, ``I'd
like my issue decided first.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have insisted on both sides coming,'' the official
said. ``But given their mind-sets we would not have had a
productive round.''
</P>
<P>
   The official suggested that the parties might have more success
in a different format than that arranged and closely supervised by
the administration at Shepherdstown.
</P>
<P>
   The administration would make such a decision after hearing from
the lower-level negotiators sent by Israel and Syria for talks this
week, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The publication of the draft treaty in Israel last week served
the Israeli government to some extent because it showed that Israel
was asking for its settlers to remain on the Golan Heights even
after Syria took control.
</P>
<P>
   This is a highly unlikely outcome, since the settlers are not
likely to choose to stay and the Syrian government would probably
not want them. But officials said that such a notion demonstrated
to Israelis that Barak was making tough demands.
</P>
<P>
   From the Syrian viewpoint, however, the publication of the
document left them ``exposed,'' an official said.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most striking concessions in the draft treaty,
Syria agreed to allow an early-warning ground station to remain on
Mount Hermon after the Israelis withdrew from the Golan Heights.
Such a monitoring station would enable Israel to detect Syrian
troop movements. In the last round of talks, in 1996, Syria had
argued that satellites or balloon-borne cameras were sufficient for
Israel's intelligence needs.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp differences remained in the draft on whether Israelis
would be allowed to man the station. Israel insists that Israelis
control the facility while the Syrians would permit only American
and French personnel, according to the document reproduced in
Ha'aretz.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most striking element of the draft treaty for the
Syrian audience was the agreement by Syria to open full diplomatic
relations with Israel with each country opening an embassy in the
other.
</P>
<P>
   Assad had also agreed, according to the draft, to the start of
trade relations, the opening of road, rail and communication links
between the two countries and the encouragement of ``mutual
tourism.''

TWO SMALL HIGH-TECH FIRMS IN ACQUISITION DEALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The maker of one of the world's top-selling electronic-commerce
security software systems, CyberTrust, is being sold by its
founder, GTE Corp., to a British rival, Baltimore Technologies PLC,
for $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, ScanSoft Inc., which develops software for
transferring digital images from scanners onto the Internet, said
it is buying out a competitor, Caere Corp., of Los Gatos, Calif.,
for about $143 million in cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   Although unrelated, the two transactions underscore both the
continuing, robust growth and the volatility of the young
high-technology companies that are a Massachusetts economic
mainstay.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Technologies's chief executive, Fran Rooney, said
about 60 CyberTrust employees, most of whom work in Needham, Mass.,
will be laid off as part of the sale. Most of these veterans,
however, are expected to be offered jobs in other GTE divisions, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rooney also plans to retire the CyberTrust brand name, at least
temporarily, ``because it is so closely associated with GTE.'' He
said some CyberTrust features may be incorporated in Baltimore
Technologies's flagship security software, UniCert.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its all-stock deal, Baltimore Technologies is also
getting CyberTrust's 70,000-square-foot building in Needham and
plans to move its US headquarters there from Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ScanSoft, which was a Xerox Corp. subsidiary until a complex
spinoff last year, offered no details about how personnel will be
deployed after its takeover of Caere Corp. is completed this
spring. But it indicated layoffs are in store.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, chief executive Mark Tivnan said
ScanSoft hopes to reduce combined operating costs by $10 million a
year or more.
</P>
<P>
   ScanSoft has about 60 employees in Peabody, Mass. and sales
offices in the United States and Britain. Caere Corp., with strong
sales activity in France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Eastern
Europe, has about 300 employees altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Glamorous on their face because of the cutting-edge products
involved, both mergers in fact involve relatively small firms that
are jockeying with many others for position in their markets.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Technologies, which Gartner Group listed last year as
``a sleeping giant,'' tied for third place in market share with
CyberTrust, behind Entrust Technologies and VeriSign. Baltimore
Technologies posted a nine-month loss Sept. 30 of $39.5 million on
sales of $26.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   At GTE, which itself is about to merge with Bell Atlantic Corp.,
CyberTrust is seen as only a blip on corporate ledgers. A
spokeswoman said GTE doesn't report financial results for its
operating units, but Baltimore Technologies said that in 1998,
CyberTrust lost $33 million on sales of $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   CyberTrust was born out of GTE's early work for the US
government on security for financial and defense secrets
transmitted over the Internet. It became a separate division,
CyberTrust Solutions, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Technologies got its start in Dublin, Ireland, in
1976, moving to London last year after a merger with another
competitor, Zergo Holdings PLC.
</P>
<P>
   It made its first overtures for CyberTrust over a year ago,
Rooney said, but added that GTE's decision to sell may have been
linked to preparations for the merger with Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Baltimore Technologies gets a specialized
computer-software hosting service that GTE operates for CyberTrust
users. Along with current CyberTrust clients such as American
Express Corp. and MasterCharge International, Rooney said, this
infrastructure provides his firm with a solid US foothold for
selling full-service e-commerce packages.
</P>
<P>
   ScanSoft and Caere are leaders in their field of software that
converts desk-scanner and digital camera images for storage or
network transmission. ScanSoft alone claims 2.9 million registered
users of its products.
</P>
<P>
   For the first nine months of 1999, the two firms posted $70
million in combined sales _ $22.99 million for ScanSoft and $47
million for Caere. ScanSoft had $2.5 million in earnings; Caere,
$5.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Stock markets in the United States were closed Monday in
observance of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, but the news sent
Baltimore Technologies shares up 23 percent on the London Stock
Exchange, where they closed at 6,752.5 pence.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's Nasdaq trading, Baltimore Technologies's American
depositary receipts closed at 89 1/16, up 5 13/16. Also on Nasdaq,
ScanSoft closed Friday at 5 3/8, and Caere at 7 7/16, both
unchanged for the day.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Motorola Inc. showed more evidence Monday that it is
in the middle of a remarkable turnaround by reporting a big jump in
fourth-quarter profits on growing demand for its cellular
telephones and semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which just a year ago was laying off thousands of
workers and trying to reorganize its operations after huge losses,
has become a Wall Street darling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This looks pretty solid,'' said Brian Modoff, an analyst at
Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown. ``There's clearly a trend toward higher
profits, because wireless is one of the fastest-growing markets out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock market was closed Monday, but shares of Motorola
soared $11.25 on Friday, to $151 a share, on expectations of a
strong showing Monday, and Motorola delivered just that, posting a
profit of 82 cents a share, excluding special items, a penny better
than Wall Street forecasts and up from about 26 cents a share in
the period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola had an operating profit of $514 million, or 82 cents a
share, compared with $159 million, or 26 cents a share in the
fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported sales of $8.5 billion in the fourth
quarter, up from sales from continuing operations of $7.9 billion,
and a record $30 billion altogether last year. It is benefiting
from soaring worldwide demand for cellular telephones and strong
growth in the semiconductor market.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, investors who had dragged the stock down to about
$40 a share a year ago, have in the last year bid it up to an
all-time high in a frenzy of buying that has been largely built on
optimism that the company is reasserting itself as a leading
developer of cellular handsets.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are also optimistic about the company's effort to
recast itself by developing new hardware platforms and a broad
array of software applications that are expected to be critical
components in the convergence of the Internet and wireless
communications devices.
</P>
<P>
   The new Motorola _ as its chief executive, Christopher Galvin,
calls it _ is betting that an increasingly wired world is going to
be dependent on a growing array of wireless communications devices
and a growing number of microchips that link up and communicate
with one another. It is a development that one Motorola executive
calls the ``trillion device problem,'' one that Motorola aims to be
at the center of.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're focusing on access technology,'' Modoff said, ``the
ability for you to access information whether it's at home through
cable modems or through wireless devices, and the ability to
control all kinds of devices from remote locations.''
</P>
<P>
   To stake out its ground in the wired world, Motorola, which is
based in Schaumburg, Ill., has moved swiftly in the last year,
forging alliances with Cisco Systems Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc.
to develop a new wireless infrastructure capable of delivering
high-speed Internet access, and acquiring, for more than $11
billion, General Instrument, a leading maker of cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola is also trying to expand its microchip franchise by
promoting semiconductors that power all kinds of devices, chips
that are planted in cars, in toasters, in high-definition
televisions, in lighting systems and more. The company even started
a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign touting its ``digital
DNA,'' which it calls the ``heart of smart'' technology.
</P>
<P>
   One of the clouds hanging over Motorola, however, has been
Iridium LLC, the $5 billion satellite telephone venture that filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection late last year. Motorola has
already taken huge charges because of its big investment in the
project, which it helped create, and on Monday the company
announced another $740 million write-off associated with Iridium.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola also remains in fierce competition with Nokia, the
Finnish cellular-telephone maker, which is the market leader. And
Motorola is trying to revive its cellular infrastructure unit,
which also fell behind a year ago by making a big bet on analog
technology when the world was turning to digital technology.
</P>
<P>
   The company's fortunes have now turned. Cellular telephones are
taking off because of soaring demand around the world. (Herschel
Shosteck &AMP; Associates projects sales of about 360 million handsets
this year.) Chips are recovering from a slowdown in parts of Asia,
and even Motorola's flagging cellular infrastructure division is
showing signs of recovery in the fourth-quarter report.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola executives have also moved to give the company a higher
profile, by introducing new consumer products, like two-way radios
for children and a watch pager developed with Timex. The company
has agreed to spend about $60 million over the next three years to
be the official wireless communications sponsor of the National
Football League.
</P>
<P>
   And Motorola is trying to bring new wireless technologies _
including Internet access _ to automobiles, and has already signed
pacts and released products in cars like the Mercedes-Benz.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After making a bad bet on analog technology over digital,
Motorola has tried to seize upon the Internet and has begun
developing devices, including cellular telephones, that deliver
Internet access. And the company has, in effect, tried to hedge its
bets by making more bets.
</P>
<P>
   The new Motorola has a new line of jazzy cellular telephones, to
compete with the stylish Nokia phones. It has pagers, microchips
and cable modems; it's under the dashboard, in your toaster, your
high-definition television sets; it's in the 3Com Palm Pilot and
Apple's MacIntosh computer. The company even built satellites for
Iridium.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Teledesic LLC, the global satellite network
that aims to become a kind of ``Internet in the sky,'' with the
help of Motorola satellite technology.
</P>
<P>
   The message is that Motorola is highly diversified and prepared
for the Internet revolution. And so far, despite an array of nimble
and fierce competitors like Nokia, Lucent and even Microsoft, Wall
Street analysts and investors are buying it.

KING BIRTHDAY PROVIDES ELECTION-YEAR BONUS FOR GORE

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On the dais of Ebenezer Baptist Church, what he called
``the high ground'' of the civil rights movement, Vice President Al
Gore clasped hands Monday with Coretta Scott King and swayed as the
choir hummed ``We Shall Overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an election-year bonus, this observance of the birthday
of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., an ``official'' tableau
provided to Gore by dint of his position as vice president and one
he used to advance his platform in the race for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   He extolled the record of the Clinton administration in
furthering the prosperity of African-Americans and their
appointments to federal positions. He called for affirmative
action, recalled his tie-breaking vote in the Senate in favor of
gun control, and lamented the Republicans' failure to confirm Bill
Lann Lee as chief of the Justice Department's civil rights
division.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating King's summons to build ``a greater economic base,''
Gore echoed phrases from his stump speech: ``We must keep our
prosperity going, not for the primary benefit of those who already
have the most, but to profit at last those who as yet have so
little. Like Dr. King, we do not seek to comfort the comfortable;
we do not seek to give away our hard-won surplus to the powerful
few, but to use it to establish justice and opportunity for the
many.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also announced that private donors had contributed half a
million dollars to help restore the Ebenezer church, where King
preached, and that the Clinton administration would seek $1.5
million in next year's budget to preserve and maintain King's
birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. King, whose husband would have been 71 on Saturday, hailed
Gore as ``a compelling advocate for racial justice.'' She praised
him for denouncing the Confederate battle flag, which flies over
the capitol of neighboring South Carolina, and recalled that his
father, the late Al Gore Sr., a longtime senator from Tennessee,
opposed the poll tax and the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour service featured two of King's children, Dexter
Scott King and the Rev. Bernice Albertine King, who offered a
fierce and passionate tribute to her mother. (``Thank you,
Bernice,'' Mrs. King said upon taking the pulpit, ``but I can take
care of myself.'')
</P>
<P>
   The audience of a few hundred people included Alexis Herman, the
labor secretary, as well as John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO,
which has endorsed Gore, and James P. Hoffa, president of the
Teamsters union, which has made no endorsement. Both served as
grand marshals in a King parade here.
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers have said that the votes of African-Americans are
crucial to his campaign, especially in the South, and Gore has made
frequent appearances here to rally blacks on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has referred to the assassination of King as an important
event in his young adulthood. He was driving from Boston to
Washington on spring break in 1968 when he heard the news on the
car radio. He said he drove to downtown Washington to pick up his
mother at a store, where protesters were smashing the windows.
</P>
<P>
   Gore described the assassination as one of the factors
contributing to his disillusionment with politics. He has said he
became more optimistic about the system after he worked as a
reporter.

CISCO BUYING 580 ACRES NEAR BOSTON FOR EXPANSION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes acquisitions text table.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Cisco Systems Inc., the big California
comptuer networking firm which has been expanding in Massachusetts,
plans to acquire 580 acres of land northwest of Boston to
accommodate up to 1.8 million square feet of new office space.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco, a maker of equipment used in constructing the backbone
for the Internet, said it plans to spend $240 million over the next
few years developing the land, in three parcels in Boxborough,
Harvard, and Littleton. The Boxborough site already has a
277,000-square-foot structure.
</P>
<P>
   The real estate purchase, being made for an undisclosed sum, is
part of Cisco's bid to aggressively expand in New England through
internal growth and possible future acquisitions, said Ellen E.
Jamason, director of worldwide real estate for Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   The company has made a string of acquisitions and investments in
Massachusetts totaling more than $3 billion over the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New England area is attractive to us in part because of
the startup and technology-related venture capital activity'' in
the region, said Jamason. ``We're also particularly attracted to
the education centers (in greater Boston). These factors make it
one of the highly fruitful areas for acquisition and talent for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Of 47 acquisitions worldwide that Cisco has made, eight have
been New England companies. Cisco has also made a number of
investments in Massachusetts companies, including Akamai
Technologies Inc. in Cambridge. Cisco invested $49 million in
Akamai before the company went public last year, a stake that is
now worth more than $1 billion, based on Akamai's market current
capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco is also hiring at a rapid pace in the Bay State and has
plans to grow its current employee base there from 1,500 to about
5,000 over the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This announcement demonstrates our commitment to the growth of
high technology in New England,'' said Don Listwin, executive vice
president of Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a clear indicator not only of the strength of our
economy, but also of Cisco's recognition that Massachusetts is an
excellent source of high technology talent,'' said Gov. Paul
Cellucci, who met with Cisco executives in November regarding the
company's plans to expand in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Though Cisco has been in Massachusetts for five years, it was
only in recent years that the company decided to set up a
substantial presence in the area. In the last two years, Cisco
spent $2.6 billion of the $3 billion used to purchase five of its
eight New England companies, which included GeoTel Communications
Corp. and WebLine Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco is not the only large technology company to have
discovered the Bay State as fertile ground for technology
development. Sun Microsystems Inc., based in Palo Alto, last year
opened a $124 million, 158-acre campus in Burlington, Mass. for its
1,800 employees. Sun, which makes network servers and computer
workstations, plans to ramp up to 4,000 employees in Burlington
over several years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Oracle Corp. of Redwood Shores, Calif., and Lucent
Technologies Inc. of Murray Hill, N.J., are among several large
technology companies that have recently beefed up their presence in
the Bay State.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco already occupies about 800,000 square feet of office space
at five sites in Chelmsford, Lowell, Burlington, Lexington, and
Manchester, N.H. The company has not decided whether it will
relocate its existing offices to the three new sites or maintain
its current leases.
</P>
<P>
   Although the land being purchased is spread among three
locations, Cisco considers them part of one main campus to be
called the New England Development Center.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco is purchasing the first site, a 140-acre parcel in
Boxborough, from Japanese computer maker NEC Technology. The site's
existing vacant building will be retrofitted by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Cisco plans to build 900,000 square feet of office
space in seven buildings on the second site, a 350-acre parcel that
straddles Boxborough and Harvard and was purchased from Towermarc
Business Park in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The third site, consisting of 90 acres of undeveloped land in
Littleton, was purchased from Hines Interests Limited Partnerships
in Houston, Texas. That parcel will have 640,000 square feet of
space in five buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the new campus, once under way, is expected to
take about 18 months, Jamason said.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco is also contemplating building a manufacturing plant on
one of the three sites. The plant, if built, would be Cisco's first
major plant outside of California, according to Carl Redfield,
senior vice president for manufacturing and logistics. Redfield
said Cisco is currently negotiating the zoning and permitting
process with local government officials.

H-E-R-E'-S JOHNNY: MCCAIN LEAVES 'EM LAUGHING ON THE CAMPAIGN
TRAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMILTON, N.H. _ Heard the one about the trees chasing the dogs?
If you were at Sen. John McCain's recent town hall meeting in
Merrimack, you would have. Twice.
</P>
<P>
   It's a little weather joke McCain likes to tell. So little water
in Arizona, the trees chase the dogs. Ba-dum-bum.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty amusing the first time, and it typically gets a chuckle
when the Republican presidential candidate uses it in his opening
remarks on the campaign trail, taking credit for bringing an
unseasonably warm day to New Hampshire from the desert. But even
his staff was silent when McCain recently offered the line a second
time to the same audience. Oops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed that as soon as I said it,'' a sheepish McCain said
later. ``They didn't laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Most candidates have a stump speech. McCain, who favors endless
question-and-answer sessions with both the public and the press,
has more of a stand-up routine. His mix of dry sarcasm, terrific
timing and a sweet rasp of a voice is reminiscent of Johnny Carson
(they also have similar hair). He can be funny off the cuff, but
the cuffs are becoming a little worn during long days riding around
New Hampshire in a campaign bus. So he relies on some old standbys:
</P>
<P>
   On who will play him in the movie version of his book, ``Faith
of My Fathers,'' a memoir of three generations of McCain military
men: ``I want Tom Cruise; my kids want Danny DeVito.''
</P>
<P>
   On the book, which many voters bring for him to autograph: ``I'm
not here to hype my book. I would never do that. $24.95, Random
House. It's been four months on the best-seller list, available on
Amazon.com. But I wouldn't hype it.''
</P>
<P>
   On campaign-finance abuses in the 1996 campaign: ``They were
renting out the Lincoln bedroom as though it were a Motel 6. Bill
Clinton was the bellhop.''
</P>
<P>
   On politicians taking credit for things they did not do: ``The
vice president invented the Internet. I invented television.''
</P>
<P>
   On young voters' cynicism about government: ``There's a study
out that says more young people believe Elvis is alive than believe
they'll ever get a Social Security check.''
</P>
<P>
   On early polls in New Hampshire: ``We were at 3 percent. The
margin of error was 5 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the story of 101-year-old Neil Tillotson of
Dixville Notch, who came up with the idea of having his northern
hamlet be the first to count its ballots in this ``first in the
nation'' primary, making the burg a must-stop on every presidential
candidate's tour.
</P>
<P>
   Seems McCain, in his self-described desperation for votes _
including all 29 in Dixville Notch _ has visited with Tillotson not
once but twice this campaign season. Asked who his favorite
Republican was, out of all the candidates he had met, the old man
replied, ``Theodore Roosevelt.'' Ba-dum-bum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think humor is really important,'' McCain said. ``I've
thought it was important all my life. I think it's important in
these kind of, what sometimes get to be high-pressure situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Like when he was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam, tapping out
jokes about Hanoi Hannah, a piece of radio propaganda, in code
through the cell walls. And now in the heat of the presidential
race, where he tells audiences _ over and over and over again _
that his only problem with a television advertisement that shows
Bill Clinton's face morphing into his own is ``that it's the
ugliest picture of me I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   There are self-deprecating lines about how, with white hair at
63, people think he is his school-age children's grandfather. He
makes jabs at the press (``they go from liberal to communist'') and
his staff (``most of them are on work-release programs''), and he
offers a riff on Harry Truman's quest for a one-armed economist
``because economists always say, `On the one hand, on the other
hand.'''
</P>
<P>
   His audience eats it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them just talk serious and serious, but he's with the
people,'' said Caroline Jowders, 78, who has heard the senator's
routine at four campaign events since summer. ``He always has a
sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   In Keene the other night, the crowd was cracking up as if it
were a comedy club.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very entertaining,'' Barbara Hecker said afterward.
``There aren't too many politicians that I think are funny.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also does a mean Bob Dole impression (though he refused

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ A year after Brazil's currency crisis took
damaging hold, Belarmino Iglesias is toasting his good fortune.
Business has rarely been better at his steakhouse, Baby Beef
Rubaiyat, an old establishment here where businessmen put together
deals over Argentine sirloin and French wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the business lunch proved immune to the crisis,''
Iglesias said in a room of crowded tables peppered with
conversations in half a dozen languages. ``Twelve months ago I was
fearful, but hyperinflation didn't materialize and our clientele
even expanded.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not just good food that weathered the 32 percent
devaluation of the Brazilian real. Buoyed by a record $28 billion
in foreign direct investment in 1999 and a 12-month stock market
rally of 164 percent in local-currency terms, the Brazilian economy
is a different beast than it was a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Growth this year is forecast at 3.5 percent, compared with a
rise of perhaps 1 percent in 1999. A handful of other indicators,
like unemployment, inflation and car production, also show signs of
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   And with concern over the Year 2000 computer problem washed
away, there has even been some calm in the currency markets, with
the Brazilian real strengthening 10 percent in recent weeks to
settle in the region of 1.79 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while almost no one expected Brazil to bounce back so
quickly, people here are beginning to look ahead in an effort to
gauge whether there is still the risk of a return to the
uncertainty, even panic, that gripped the country a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from some of the challenges ahead, the kind of lasting
stability enjoyed by rich industrial nations still seems somewhat
elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Brazilians tend to have a short memory, but it's not that
short,'' said Oswaldo Castro Jr., sales director of Expresso
Aracatuba, one of the nation's largest trucking companies. ``You'd
think it's about time we reach the point where we can stop managing
our business from one crisis to the next.''
</P>
<P>
   One big doubt about a departure from crisis mode has to do with
the country's banks and their willingness to increase borrowing in
a credit-starved economy. After the real was floated a year ago and
doomsday predictions about a debt default were common, Brazilian
banks held firm and continued to buy government bonds. And although
the prescience of this strategy proved a windfall for these
institutions, with high-yield debt portfolios fattening profits,
banks made few moves to increase lending to individuals or
companies. Even with interest rates more than halved by the end of
1999, to 19 percent, loans remained rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the recovery to be consolidated, interest rates must come
down and consumer credit expanded,'' said Walter Molano, Latin
America economist at BCP Securities in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Yet because of possible interest rate increases in the United
States and the European Union, there may not be much room for the
central bank to lower rates. Economists see key rates declining to
perhaps 14 percent or 15 percent, but not much further.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, that might be enough to kick-start Brazilian companies
into again seeking domestic financing, said Carlos Novis Guimaraes,
head of Latin American investment banking at Lehman Brothers.
``Once you start lowering rates, that creates advantages for local
companies to finance acquisitions and other expansion,'' Guimaraes
said. ``This means there will be more advisory work. The outlook
for investment banks has certainly improved.''
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, interest rate cuts will largely hinge on
government efforts to contain spending. Improvements in
corporate-tax collection and belt-tightening steps have started to
pay off, with Brazil surpassing most budget goals agreed to with
the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   According to Raul Velloso, a Brasilia-based specialist on public
spending, the government's surplus before paying interest on its
debt rose to an estimated $13.2 billion in 1999, compared with
$2.74 billion a year earlier. He said this measure of surplus could
further improve this year.
</P>
<P>
   After interest payments are taken into account, however, the
numbers look a lot worse, with a deficit in 1999 of roughly 11
percent of the gross domestic product, one of the highest in the
world for an economy the size of Brazil's. The government could
succeed in lowering that to the equivalent of 3.8 percent of
output, according to Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   While efforts to reduce spending continue, it is widely believed
that medium- or even long-term economic stability is unreachable
without increasing exports.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because its domestic market is so large, Brazil still has
one of the world's lowest ratios of exports to its output _ at 7
percent, according to Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University. While
this puts Brazil ahead of the weakest economies, it is far behind
the largest emerging-market economy _ China, with an export-to-GDP
ratio around 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that exports are finally starting to surge a
year after the devaluation made Brazilian products less expensive
abroad. In December, a month in which imports traditionally
generate trade deficits, Brazil had a trade surplus of $249
million. And during the first two weeks of January, exports rose an
estimated 30 percent compared with the similar period a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the improvement has to do with more vibrant markets for
Brazilian goods in Asia and Europe. But while a healthier global
economy holds promise for Brazilian companies, perhaps the greatest
risk for recovery also comes from abroad. ``We are in a rising
global interest rate environment,'' said Geoffrey Dennis, Latin
America equity strategist for Salomon Smith Barney. ``How Brazil
will weather an increase in American or European rates, no one
knows.

DAN, NOT EVEN YOU HAVE MAGIC TO PULL OFF THIS COMEBACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Dan,
</P>
<P>
   It is time to go. It is time to walk away while you can still
limp. It is time to give up on that Super Bowl ring while you still
have your dignity. Time's up.
</P>
<P>
   You've had 37 career comebacks, but you should not even attempt
this one. The clock has run out on your brilliant 17-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Please, don't consider Jimmy Johnson's retirement announcement
an invitation to return for one more season. Follow his lead.
</P>
<P>
   You will be 39 next season. You have been sacked 291 times in
your career. You have had eight operations.
</P>
<P>
   You wear a special brace on your right foot to protect the
Achilles' tendon that ruptured and ended your 1993 season after
five games. You have a special shoe that supports the right ankle
that was fractured in 1996. You have a bulky brace that holds
together a left knee that has been operated on five times. You have
a corset-like brace that protects the hip that was so badly bruised
in 1995 that blood and fluid had to be drained from it for 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Your body is battered. Your career is bruised.
</P>
<P>
   What makes you think next season will be any better?
</P>
<P>
   Your quarterback rating this season was a career-low 67.4. Trent
Dilfer, Jeff Garcia, Tim Couch and Gus Frerotte were better than
that.
</P>
<P>
   You were 5-7 as a starter this season. Your backup, Damon Huard,
was 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   We should be honoring your legend. We should be celebrating your
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   You are the greatest quarterback ever to play the game. You own
25 NFL records and share five others. There is a Hall of Fame bust
on hold for you in Canton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, this is how we remember you: On your hands and knees
earlier this season as the New York Jets returned an interception
for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   This picture of you is not flattering, Dan.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still was Saturday's 62-7 loss to the Jacksonville
Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   We wonder what in the world you were thinking when you hit
Jacksonville cornerback Aaron Beasley right in the hands with your
first pass.
</P>
<P>
   We hear you begging Johnson at halftime to return to the lineup
despite trailing 41-7.
</P>
<P>
   We see you standing on the sideline in a baseball cap after
throwing two interceptions and losing a fumble that was returned
for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   We smell blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for him,'' Jaguars right tackle Leon Searcy said
of you. ``He was one of the best.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the past tense now, Dan.
</P>
<P>
   We know you dream of going out like Michael Jordan and John
Elway.
</P>
<P>
   There should be a poster made of you hoisting the Vince Lombardi
Trophy high above your head like Elway or striking a pose with your
right wrist in place after scoring the championship game-winner
like Jordan. You don't deserve a 62-7 loss in your last game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows what Dan is going to do, but this is no way for
it to end,'' your teammate, defensive end Trace Armstrong, said
after Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   But you are not the only great player never to win a
championship. That honor roll includes Charles Barkley, Gale
Sayers, Willie McCovey, Ernie Banks, O.J. Simpson and Barry
Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   If your career were meant to have a happy ending, Dan, it would
have happened by now.
</P>
<P>
   You will make $7.5 million next season. Memories are not worth
that much.
</P>
<P>
   New Dolphins coach Dave Wannstedt did not exactly give you a
vote of confidence in his introductory news conference Sunday. He
referred to your future as ``the Dan thing,'' and said, ``It's a
very sensitive issue. We're going to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   You need to do the right thing, Dan. You need to make it easy on
the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   You have overstayed your welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Don't end up like Simpson in a San Francisco 49ers uniform. Or
Joe Namath in a Los Angeles Rams uniform. Or Willie Mays in a New
York Mets uniform.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have a championship ring.
</P>
<P>
   But you have wealth. You have your health. You have your family.
You have your place in history. You have your memories. You have
plenty of opportunities for a second career. That should be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye, Dan. nn

ANALYSIS: SYRIANS FAULT ISRAELI INTRANSIGENCE ON GOLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria _ The Syrian-Israeli peace talks were never
expected to be easy. And now decades of Syrian mistrust, born of
isolation and a dogged view of what is a just solution for Syria's
main grievance, have caused a breakdown in discussions.
</P>
<P>
   In Damascus on Monday night, there was no official comment on
the announcement from Washington that peace talks between the two
have been suspended. The discussions, brokered by Washington,
restarted late last year after a four-year hiatus and were to
continue this week.
</P>
<P>
   But commentary in the government-run press and radio repeated a
consistent line: that the talks have stumbled because as a first
step, Israel must agree that Syria owns the Golan Heights, the
strategic plateau it lost in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Only then,
in the Syrian view, can bargaining take place over other issues,
like water rights, normalization of diplomatic ties and security
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The official Damascus radio kept up the antagonistic tone that
has emerged over the last few days. It accused Israel of
sidestepping the key component of peace. And it said Monday that at
the negotiating session that ended last week in Shepherdstown, W.
Va., ``the Israeli side kept evading the demarcation of June 4,
1967, lines.'' In fact, Israel has not agreed to new borders,
though it has suggested a willingness to give up the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   Syria complains that the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, is
trying to make the talks a ``labyrinth'' and is entering into
``negotiations for the sake of negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The government newspaper Tishreen made the same points. Talking
of normalization before a full Israeli withdrawal is ``placing the
cart before the horse.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper accused Israel of not treating seriously the
negotiating committee that is meant to deal with the border, a
denunciation that may mean only that those talks were not given
priority.
</P>
<P>
   In general, these statements echo the position that Syria has
held with a prickly pride as first the Egyptians, then the
Palestinians and then the Jordanians, signed peace accords with
Israel over the past 21 years. Under Hafez Assad, the enigmatic
Syrian president who commanded his country's air force in the
disastrous 1967 war, unconditional recovery of the Golan has been a
Syrian mantra. It is taught in the schools _ and has been for 33
years _ as the essential component of Syrian self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   So last week when an Israeli newspaper published a working paper
prepared by U.S. officials on the status of the talks _ and that
paper outlined an Israeli position in favor of allowing some 17,000
Israeli settlers to remain in the Golan after a peace deal _ the
reaction in Syria was one of anger.
</P>
<P>
   The document was already in the hands of the Syrians and the
Israelis. But its publication suggested it was a draft treaty and,
as the Syrian official press noted with indignation, that implied
that Syria was negotiating over whether it would regain full
sovereignty over the land.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides still say they are committed to a resolution of
Golan, but every word and phrase and even the tone can be sensitive
enough to throw the talks off track.
</P>
<P>
   Assad is of the generation of political figures who came of age
during a period of nascent Arab nationalism. That idea of a unique
Arab identity grew out of resistance to European colonialism and
was nurtured by the Cold War, which made the Arab world a strategic
player, or at least a stage, in international politics.
</P>
<P>
   In Syria, this sense of a special Arab destiny became even more
fierce and immutable after the bruising military conflicts with
Israel. Run by a man from a small religious minority group, the
Alawites, and threatened in the past by internal uprisings, Assad's
Syria has remained more isolated than its neighbors and, with the
exception of Iraq, more tightly controlled by the central
government.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, many diplomats in the region said, Syria
came to the peace talks not only to regain land. Had it held out
indefinitely, rather than negotiate, its central national conceit
of being the one Arab state to remain true to Arab ideals would
remain intact. Syria had other, parallel goals.
</P>
<P>
   With the collapse of its erstwhile patron, the Soviet Union, and
the new U.S.-sponsored military alliance between Turkey and Israel,
the Syrian regime sought a beneficial and well-defined relationship
with the United States consistent with its self-image as a
strategic player.
</P>
<P>
   Farouk al-Sharaa, the Syrian foreign minister who led his
negotiating team in Shepherdstown, is said by his diplomatic
contemporaries to be an avid student of Asian and Middle East
history and of the modern Israeli political scene. And according to
diplomats who are in close contact with the Syrians, he was sent to
the latest round of talks on the strength of a belief in Damascus
that the United States had obtained a private Israeli commitment to
full withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   The euphoria in the United States and in parts of Israel after
the first round of ice-breaking talks in Washington in December did
nothing to dissuade the Syrians from this view.
</P>
<P>
   But the second set of talks were followed by an agreement to
divert Barak briefly from the Syrians to meet in Washington with
Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader. Further, there were reports
from Israel of political and religious resistance there to giving
up the Golan Heights, resistance that Barak's government is obliged
to overcome no matter what promises the United States may have
made.
</P>
<P>
   While none of these machinations are new, they seem to have
thrown the Syrian negotiators, who have fallen back for now to
their well-honed position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Syria,'' said Tishreen, the government newspaper, ``is
concerned with a just and honorable peace that returns land to its
indigenous owners.''

 &HT;     BRADLEY, GORE SPAR ON CIVIL RIGHTS IN FINAL IOWA DEBATE   (For
use by New York Times News Service clients.)   By DAN
FREEDMAN   c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  DES MOINES, Iowa _ Before a
<TEXT>
mostly-minority audience on the Martin Luther King Jr. national
holiday, Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley
attempted Monday to one-up each other on who is best qualified to
carry on the slain civil rights leader's legacy.
<P>
   The two Democratic candidates used their last face-to-face
meeting before the Jan. 24 Iowa caucuses to argue over Medicaid and
racial profiling in a debate otherwise marked by general agreement
that civil rights law enforcement and educational opportunity must
be expanded, and affirmative action protected.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks make up just 1.7 percent and Hispanics 1.1 percent of
Iowa's 2.8 million people. But minorities are an important part of
the Democratic base of support and the debate itself, broadcast on
MSNBC, could resonate among minority voters well beyond Iowa's
borders.Gore is comfortably ahead of Bradley in most polls, leading
the former New Jersey senator and New York Knicks basketball star
54 percent to 33 percent in the latest Des Moines Register Poll.
And polls have shown that blacks favor Gore over Bradley by a
2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   On a question about racial profiling, a criminal identification
technique used by law enforcement agencies that has been decried by
minorities, Bradley and Gore both said that as president they would
issue executive orders banning racial profiling.Bradley challenged
Gore to walk into President Clinton's office and tell him to ``sign
this executive order today.''After cheers from the audience, Gore
shot back: ``I don't think President Bill Clinton needs Bill
Bradley to tell him how to stand up and fight for
African-Americans.''Gore then said that Sharpe James, the long-time
mayor of Newark, N.J. _ the largest city of the state Bradley
represented 18 years in the Senate _ was a Gore supporters
``because President Clinton and I have helped him on racial
profiling.''Gore attacked Bradley on his health care plan, which
among other things would eliminate Medicaid, which subsidizes
health care for poor people. Under Bradley's plan, Medicaid would
be replaced by a income-based subsidy for health care and the
health insurance program for federal workers would be expanded to
cover non-employees.Gore introduced black and Hispanic families in
the audience he said would receive a $150 ``voucher'' under the
Bradley health plan if they lost Medicaid.Bradley defended his
plan, saying that ``only politicians in Washington think Medicaid
is a great system,'' a jibe at Gore's background growing up in
Washington and spending virtually a lifetime in elective office.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the nation's doctors do not accept Medicaid
patients, Bradley said. ``Two dentists in Des Moines accept
Medicaid,'' he said. ``That's not good enough.''He denied that his
plan would replace Medicaid with a voucher, explaining that it
relies on a ``weighted average'' that would ideally subsidize
health care for the poor according to income. Gore compared
Bradley's ``weighted average'' to ``the guy who's got his feet on a
block of ice and his head in the oven and according to the
'weighted average' he was comfortable.''The forum, sponsored by the
Black-Brown Coalition, an organization of blacks and Hispanics, is
the final forum for the two Democratic candidates before next
Monday's caucuses in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The debate's only unscripted dramatic highlight was the removal
of a woman environmental activist who interrupted the debate with a
denunciation of global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates said they would appoint Supreme Court justices
who support affirmative action. And both supported the idea of
appointing a first-ever Hispanic to the Supreme Court, though they
stopped short of an iron-clad commitment.
</P>
<P>
   In other areas of agreement, both said the Confederate battle
flag was a symbol of racial insensitivity and exclusion and should
be removed from atop the South Carolina Capitol, as well as any
other government building.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the leading Republican candidates for president,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Arizona Sen. John McCain, have
described it as a state matter.Gore accused the Republicans of
backing away from the issue because they are ``scared of the right
wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Both of the Democratic candidates go back on the road in Iowa
Tuesday in a final sprint to win support in the symbolically
important Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is scheduled to visit four locations southeast of Des
Moines while Bradley is scheduled to go to Iowa City, home of the
University of Iowa, and then fly to New Hampshire for a day of
campaigning in that state, which holds its primary on Feb. 1.

NEIGHBOR FED UP WITH VISITS FROM ELEPHANTS

<P>
   CUT AND SHOOT, Texas _ A warning from his grandson caused Robin
Walker to look up from his living room couch.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was startled to see an elephant pressing its head against
the sliding glass door that led to his back yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Papa, I think we got a problem,'' 5-year-old Zachary Mitchell
told his grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, a 42-year-old machinist, said he feared that the beast
looming in his doorway would burst into living room.
</P>
<P>
   Believing the elephant was drawn by the family's presence,
Walker said he took his wife, Debbie, 49, and Zachary into the back
of the house. The elephant stopped pressing against the door soon
after they left the room, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jan. 5 close encounter with an elephant was not the first
Walker has had since he moved into his house about 50 miles north
of Houston 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said Monday that an elephant has escaped from his
neighbor's property at least once previously. But this was the
first time one had ever tried to come into his house.
</P>
<P>
   A furious Walker climbed onto a bench in his backyard and yelled
over the fence for his neighbor to come get his elephant. About
that time, some of the elephants that had not escaped began
trumpeting, and, as if in response to a signal, the loose elephant
crashed through a 6-foot wooden fence that separates the properties
and returned to the herd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went right through it like it was matchsticks,'' Walker
said.
</P>
<P>
   The elephant is the property of Walker's neighbor, Bill Swain, a
51-year-old animal trainer who has kept up to six elephants on his
seven-acre property since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Swain, owner of Trunks and Humps Inc., said he is making every
effort to be a good neighbor and is taking steps to ensure that his
elephants stay off Walker's property.
</P>
<P>
   Swain and his trapeze-artist wife Mayola, 49, come from two
generations of circus performers. Swain said his four elephants,
three camels and two llamas are booked at performances throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
   The elephants appeared in the movies ``The Little Princess'' and
``Jungle Book'', he said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker took his complaint to the Cut and Shoot City Council last
week, and the two neighbors presented their cases.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Lang Thompson said Swain was issued a permit in 1984
giving him permission to keep two elephants on his property. Walker
is asking the city to force Swain to adhere to his permit.
</P>
<P>
   Swain is putting up a wire fence around his property, building
larger pens and has carted away a pile of elephant manure that the
Walkers have complained about. He has contracted to have the manure
removed regularly, but that's as far as he is willing to go, he
said. The four elephants will stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of like the Syrians and the Hebrews having a
conversation,'' Swain said about Walker's demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived her for 20 years,'' Swain said. ``I've built this
business up to where me and my family can make a decent living. I'm
willing to compromise to a reasonable point.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker is not convinced that a new fence will make any
difference, although he and his wife are grateful that the manure
has been removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A chain-link fence like that, he'll rip that wire like tissue
paper,'' he said about the elephants. ``I can't be assured that,
under the present circumstances, one won't wake up in the bed with
me,'' he Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Swain said the elephant that pressed its head against Walker's
glass door escaped from a temporary pen formed by an electric wire,
known as a hot pen.
</P>
<P>
   A pine branch fell on the wire, allowing the elephant to wander
onto Walker's property, Swain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, this really ignited the situation,'' Swain
said. ``Perhaps I was neglectful in some ways, but it wasn't
intentional.''

ISRAELI-SYRIAN TALKS ARE POSTPONED INDEFINITELY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs to correct spelling to 'Shepherdstown' sted `Shephardstown'

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a setback for the Israeli-Syrian peace talks
that was precipitated by a Syrian demand that its major negotiating
point be settled immediately, the Clinton administration announced
on Monday that the resumption of the negotiations had been
postponed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The administration was careful not to blame either side, saying
in a deliberately worded statement by Secretary of State, Madeleine
Albright that ``their approaches to the next round differ, and as a
result, there is going to be a delay'' in the talks set for
Wednesday at Shepherdstown, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the
Syrian foreign minister, Farouk al-Shara, coming as expected, both
sides would send experts to Washington to ``provide their
comments'' on the draft peace treaty written by the United States,
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official downplayed the seriousness of
the snag, saying that instead of having the two negotiators come to
the United States and ``dig in,'' it was judged that it would be
more productive to wait.
</P>
<P>
   The administration set no public time line for new talks, but
officials suggested they would be working feverishly behind the
scenes to keep momentum and resolve the problem of how to deal with
each side's determination to have their positions dealt with first.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has gone out of its way to try and solve each
side's major issues simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   The resumption of the talks unraveled Sunday when the Syrian
media announced that Israel must make its withdrawal from the Golan
Heights to the line of June 4, 1967, the eve of the Six Day War,
the first order of business in the new round.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, this Syrian demand was made in response to the leaking
in the Israeli press last week of the American draft peace treaty,
diplomats said. The draft was interpreted in the Arab world as
Syria making big concessions _ including the normalization of
relations with Israel and allowing an early warning ground station
on Mount Hermon on the Golan Heights _ without Syria winning a
major concession from the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Another complicating factor for the Syrians was the fact that
the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, has been long scheduled to
see President Clinton at the White House on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrians did not relish languishing in Shepherdstown, W.Va.,
while Arafat, hardly a real friend of the Syrian leader, Hafez
Assad, was feted at the White House, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak added another negative factor for the Syrians by
suggesting that he would meet with Arafat and Clinton in
Washington, leaving the Syrians even further out in the cold.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the Syrian and Israeli capitals, the two governments reacted
to the postponement with degrees of defiance.
</P>
<P>
   A Syrian official in Damascus was quoted by Reuters as saying:
``The return of the Golan is not a matter for bargaining of
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, Barak said: ``It is impossible to threaten us. If
it isn't comfortable for the Syrians to come now, and they need
some time, they should take some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials had predicted that the appearance of
their draft peace treaty in Ha'aretz, a daily Israeli newspaper,
last week would make their job more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, a telephone conversation between Clinton and
Assad at the end of last week went quite well. But after that,
Albright and Dennis Ross, the main American negotiator, made a
series of phone calls to Barak and Shara over the weekend and on
Monday to try to keep the talks on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge facing the Clinton administration, according to a
senior official, is to devise a formula that gives both sides
assurances that their primary needs will be met in a way that
satisfies their domestic audiences. Giving such assurances was hard
in advance of negotiations, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   For the Israeli government, the uppermost concern is the depth
of security guarantees that Israel will receive in return for
giving up the Golan Heights. Barak has insisted that Israel cannot
agree on a border with Syria until it knows what security
guarantees Damascus and Washington will provide.
</P>
<P>
   Successive Israeli prime ministers have told the Israeli people
that Israel would not allow Syria to regain a position on the Sea
of Galilee, a central demand of the Syrians. Assad, who runs his
country with a dictatorial fist, has insisted to his people that
Israel must give up the entire Golan Heights to the line that
existed before the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official who briefed reporters on Monday
said that as negotiations edged closer to making the ``big
decision,'' it was not a surprise that each side would say, ``I'd
like my issue decided first.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have insisted on both sides coming,'' the official
said. ``But given their mind-sets we would not have had a
productive round.''
</P>
<P>
   The official suggested that the parties might have more success
in a different format than that arranged and closely supervised by
the administration at Shepherdstown.
</P>
<P>
   The administration would make such a decision after hearing from
the lower-level negotiators sent by Israel and Syria for talks this
week, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The publication of the draft treaty in Israel last week served
the Israeli government to some extent because it showed that Israel
was asking for its settlers to remain on the Golan Heights even
after Syria took control.
</P>
<P>
   This is a highly unlikely outcome, since the settlers are not
likely to choose to stay and the Syrian government would probably
not want them. But officials said that such a notion demonstrated
to Israelis that Barak was making tough demands.
</P>
<P>
   From the Syrian viewpoint, however, the publication of the
document left them ``exposed,'' an official said.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most striking concessions in the draft treaty,
Syria agreed to allow an early-warning ground station to remain on
Mount Hermon after the Israelis withdrew from the Golan Heights.
Such a monitoring station would enable Israel to detect Syrian
troop movements. In the last round of talks, in 1996, Syria had
argued that satellites or balloon-borne cameras were sufficient for
Israel's intelligence needs.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp differences remained in the draft on whether Israelis
would be allowed to man the station. Israel insists that Israelis
control the facility while the Syrians would permit only American
and French personnel, according to the document reproduced in
Ha'aretz.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most striking element of the draft treaty for the
Syrian audience was the agreement by Syria to open full diplomatic
relations with Israel with each country opening an embassy in the
other.
</P>
<P>
   Assad had also agreed, according to the draft, to the start of
trade relations, the opening of road, rail and communication links
between the two countries and the encouragement of ``mutual
tourism.''

N.Y. GOP TO CHALLENGE MCCAIN PETITIONS IN HALF OF STATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Republican State Committee, which is supporting
Gov. George W. Bush in the presidential race, said Monday that it
would seek to disqualify Sen. John McCain from the primary ballot
in roughly half the state. State party officials said the McCain
campaign had in many instances failed to meet the arduous petition
requirements, which the officials themselves devised.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of threatening to wield the election law to beat
back McCain, the officials said they would file papers by a
deadline Tuesday, formally challenging the McCain nominating
petitions in 15 to 17 of the state's 31 congressional districts.
They declined to identify the districts.
</P>
<P>
   The move opens what is expected to become a costly legal
skirmish that will once again highlight how the rules for gaining a
ballot spot in New York's Republican presidential primary are
unusually forbidding to all but the party favorite. In many states,
the party leadership does not choose sides in presidential
primaries and widely recognized candidates like McCain are assured
a place on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican establishment in New York has thrown its muscle
behind Bush and made it clear that the faithful should shun other
candidates. The McCain campaign says it was unable even to hire a
prominent Republican election lawyer, and instead had to retain a
Democrat, Henry Berger, who represented the Clinton-Gore campaign
in the state in 1996 and had never before worked for a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has sued in federal court to overturn the New York
system, suggested that the state party was trying to rig the March
7 primary for Bush, who with the party's assistance has easily
gained a ballot spot across the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed,'' McCain said while campaigning in New
Hampshire. ``Everybody knows that I'm a qualified candidate and I'm
sorry they're going to do that. I don't see the point; if you've
got $74 million and you've got all the organization, you've got
everything, why do you want to challenge somebody off the ballot?''
</P>
<P>
   With little money and few ties to party officials, the McCain
campaign had struggled to gather the required signatures, failing
to reach the threshold in six of the state's 31 congressional
districts. The party is expected to file challenges in five of
those districts, as well as 10 to 12 others, to insure that McCain
is not allowed on the ballot in those districts, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the McCain campaign filed its nominating petitions
earlier this month, the Republican party has dispatched a squad of
workers to ferret out possible errors in paperwork. Monday, the
party's chief counsel, Jeffrey T. Buley, said he had identified
many signatures of people who were not registered to vote, were not
Republicans or did not live in the districts _ three of the
criteria for valid petitions.
</P>
<P>
   Buley defended the requirements, saying they are intended to
ensure that candidates who appear on the ballot are committed to
getting to know the state by establishing an organization. ``It's
all part of developing grass roots support,'' Buley said.
``Obviously, Gov. Bush has worked long and hard at gaining the
support of the New York GOP.''
</P>
<P>
   Buley also said that the party decided not to challenge McCain's
petitions on more arcane points, like trying to knock off
signatures on pages that list the wrong date.
</P>
<P>
   The petition fight raises the prospect that, if McCain wins the
primary on Feb. 1 in New Hampshire, where he is locked in a tight
race with Bush, he would then be forced to virtually forfeit the
New York contest because many Republicans would not be able to vote
for him. (There are several other primaries on the same day,
including one in California, where well-known candidates
automatically garner a spot.)
</P>
<P>
   Three other Republicans who will appear on the ballots in most
other states _ Gary Bauer, Sen. Orrin Hatch and Alan Keyes _ have
withdrawn from New York, all citing the difficulty of complying
with the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the millionaire publisher, who successfully took
his case to federal court in 1996 over similar issues and was
placed on the ballot across the state, this year spent $750,000
hiring lawyers and petition gatherers, and is expected to gain a
spot in all districts. State Republicans this year say they will
not dispute the petitions of Forbes, who is considered less of a
threat to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic primary rules also require petitions, but they
are somewhat less complicated. The major contenders, Vice President
Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, will both be on the ballot
across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Almost daily in the last week, McCain has demanded that Bush and
Gov. George Pataki, Bush's most prominent supporter in the state,
forswear petition challenges. Bush and his aides have tried to
distance him from the dispute. ``It's a decision for the state
party to make,'' a spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, Mindy Tucker,
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, the party leader, has said anyone with grass-roots
support should be able to comply with the rules.

AS JOHNSON TAKES REINS, PARCELLS LIKELY WON'T 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert Wood Johnson IV will be approved by National
Football League owners Tuesday morning and introduced as the Jets'
new owner soon afterward. But his search for a new head coach will
apparently not be as smooth a process.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has tried to persuade Bill Parcells to return as head
coach, but all signs point against Parcells returning to the
sideline. He said on Jan. 5, the day after Bill Belichick turned
down the job as his successor, that he would not come out of
retirement, and he is apparently sticking to that position.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months ago, Parcells told Leon Hess, the Jets' owner before
his death in May, that this would be his last season. And he likes
to recall a saying by the former Buffalo Bills coach Marv Levy:
``When you're thinking of retirement, you're already retired.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Johnson, who is paying $635 million for the Jets, will
try again, perhaps Tuesday or Wednesday, to persuade Parcells to
change his mind. The pair met last Wednesday in a get-acquainted
session and spoke for a few minutes again Friday. Johnson has
wanted to be accepted officially by the other owners before making
any announcements regarding the team.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most of the Jets' assistant coaches, including a leading
candidate to replace Parcells, the linebacker coach Al Groh, are in
Mobile, Ala., sizing up the players who will be in Saturday's
Senior Bowl. The coaches will return late Thursday. By then,
Johnson will know more about his team's new coach, but will
probably still be wondering about the would-be coach _ Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue is expected to discuss the Belichick
situation with Johnson on Tuesday. The Jets contend that they
retain the rights to Belichick and thus will be entitled to
compensation if he coaches another team. He was the head coach for
a day after Parcells quit, but then Belichick resigned. Parcells
then said that he would not coach again, and has cited so many
reasons for retiring that there appears little Johnson can do to
change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells respects Johnson and also feels an allegiance to a team
whose culture he changed from perennial loser to playoff contender.
He also feels a moral obligation to Hess, who gave Parcells the
autonomy to shape the Jets and never interfered.
</P>
<P>
   So assuming Parcells rebuffs all efforts to get him back on the
sideline, the question becomes, what role does he play and for how
long? The most likely answer is that Parcells will still run the
football operation as he has for three years. He said he was
willing to yield those duties to Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   But if Groh were the choice for head coach, the Jets would be
promoting someone with no experience dealing with the world of free
agency and salary caps. That would be even more reason for Parcells
not only to remain, but also to have considerable input and
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Among the scenarios Johnson is thought to have envisioned with
Parcells is one similar to Jimmy Johnson's role with Miami this
season. Johnson ran the show and was head coach but nominated Dave
Wannstedt as his top assistant. Then, last Sunday, Johnson stepped
down and was replaced by Wannstedt. Parcells, as director of
football operations, could keep a close eye on Groh or whoever
might become head coach.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of a head coach will also affect the return of the
assistants.
</P>
<P>
   A significant number of the coaches are in Mobile. The Senior
Bowl is a weeklong event at which assistants use their free time to
try to impress other teams' head coaches and general managers _
potential employers.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago the Jets ended the season as clearly one of the
league's top teams, despite not making the playoffs. Now the Jets'
assistants are wondering where their next jobs will be.

ON PRO FOOTBALL: A STRANGE BUT EXCITING WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There were many exhilarating and bizarre moments from the
National Football League division playoff weekend, and one happened
somewhere past midfield at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis, when
running back Eddie George was breaking his breathtaking 68-yard
touchdown run and, in turn, breaking the spirit of the Indianapolis
Colts.
</P>
<P>
   As George rumbled toward the end zone, he glanced up at the
giant replay screen to watch himself. A tiny smile broke across his
face, as in, ``Wow, I look pretty good.'' And he did, outrunning
three defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the TV cameras caught me checking out the replay
screen to see if anyone was catching up to me from behind,'' a
modest George said. ``I know I shouldn't have done that. I tried to
focus on just pumping my legs and not letting the turf monster trip
me up.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the more fascinating sights of the playoffs: a
broad-shouldered, 6-foot-3-inch, 240-pound runner, built like a
superhero but fast enough to set off a radar gun, outrunning
supposedly speedier Colts defensive backs, en route to one of the
biggest touchdowns in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie was worried someone was going to catch him, because if
he was caught, he would have never heard the end of it from us,''
said Tennessee receiver Yancey Thigpen. ``People don't realize it,
but once he gets going, he gets on a roll. When you see those
defensive backs chasing him for 60 yards and he outruns them that
says it all.''
</P>
<P>
   What a run. What a weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, a coach quits. In New York, a coach just says no. In
St. Louis, there was a track meet, while in Tampa Bay, it was a
game from the 1950s. Peyton Manning struggled, Steve McNair
excelled, Kurt Warner tossed five touchdowns and somebody named
Shaun King became the first rookie quarterback in 23 years to win a
playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   The weird, the spectacular, the ugly. It was all there.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans, the current incarnation of the old Houston Oilers,
won the franchise's first division playoff game since 1979. That's
good. Television cameras caught Minnesota wide receiver Randy Moss
squirting liquid from a container at an official who had made a
call Moss did not like. That's bad. Look for the star player to
receive a hefty fine from the league, and maybe an endorsement from
a bottled water company.
</P>
<P>
   And by the way, instant replay worked. Beautifully. It correctly
reversed a punt return for a touchdown by the Colts' Terrence
Wilkins, who had clearly stepped out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very, very strange weekend,'' Thigpen said. ``You
watch some of the games and just sit back in disbelief.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Williams, the defensive coordinator for the Titans, said:
``I saw great plays. I saw wild games. I saw it all.''
</P>
<P>
   The strangeness led to two intriguing conference championship
games for Sunday. Tampa Bay may be the only team that can slow the
offensive juggernaut of the Rams. The Buccaneers have the speed and
depth on defense, especially when St. Louis goes to three and four
wide receivers. And defensive lineman Warren Sapp will surely be in
the face of Warner all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people may think that St. Louis will beat them
handily,'' said Tennessee coach Jeff Fisher. ``But with Tampa Bay's
defense, don't count on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville has lost only twice this season, both times to the
Titans. Perhaps the Jaguars see the Tennessee players in their
nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   It was Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson who endured a living
nightmare against the Jaguars on Saturday. Johnson was leaning
toward retiring from professional football anyway, but the
humiliating 62-7 loss to Jacksonville was a not-so-gentle shove. In
the end, Johnson's four-year tenure can only be viewed as
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   As a television analyst, it was Johnson who criticized Don
Shula, the former Dolphins coach, saying that Shula was failing to
take advantage of a Super Bowl-caliber team and organization.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson and Shula's records were almost identical. In
Shula's last four seasons, from 1992 to 1995, he was 39-25 with a
2-3 playoff record. Johnson, from 1996 to 1999, was 36-28, and also
had a 2-3 record in postseason play. But Shula never had an
embarrassing playoff loss like Johnson did Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances of Johnson's departure provide a stark
contrast to the status of St. Louis coach Dick Vermeil. While
Johnson leaves the game in embarrassing fashion, Vermeil, who last
season was on the verge of being fired, is so confident that he
says his team has no weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the RCA Dome. In one corner Colts running back Edgerrin
James, with a long face, tried to explain how he was held to only
2.8 yards a carry.
</P>
<P>
   A short walk down the hall, George was all smiles. He began to
daydream about the old days four years ago, when the Titans were
the Houston Oilers, and his rookie year, after the team returned
from a road game, there were two measly fans in the airport singing
the fight song.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `We have a long way to go,''' George said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Titans arrived at Nashville International Airport late
Saturday night, there were 8,000 fans cheering George and his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference. What a weekend.

 &HT;    DEMOCRATS DEBATE RACIAL PROFILING
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ In the last debate before Iowa's Democratic
presidential caucus, Bill Bradley Monday challenged Vice President
Al Gore to demand that President Clinton immediately issue an order
ending racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   , Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley challenge sparked a heated defense of Clinton from Gore,
who had earlier promised that one of his first acts as president
would be to sign an executive order ending the practice by which
some police offers target racial minority motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he had no doubt that Gore would fulfill that
promise. However, he told Gore: ``We have a president now. You
serve with him. I want you to walk into his office and say, 'Sign
this executive order today.'''
</P>
<P>
   As many in the audience cheered, Gore rushed to the defense of
Clinton, who has had an unusually close political and personal
relationship with minorities during his two terms in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think President Bill Clinton needs a lecture from Bill
Bradley about how to stand up and fight for African Americans and
Latinos,'' Gore said, also to cheers.
</P>
<P>
   But a scattering of boos arose when Gore added, ``It's one thing
to talk the talk. It's another thing to walk the walk,'' a common
refrain among civil rights activists.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Sharpe James, the African American mayor of
Newark, N.J., had once sought help from Bradley to end racial
profiling during Bradley's tenure in the Senate, but that Bradley
had demurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's supporting me because President Clinton and I helped him
with racial profiling,'' Gore said. James, following the debate,
confirmed Gore's account, but Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser
dismissed James's comments as ``politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said that if elected he would immediately sign an
executive order to end the ``pernicious'' practice of racial
profiling and would ``sic'' the Justice Department on police
departments that did not comply.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``Brown-Black'' Forum was staged on the national
holiday honoring the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and just one
week before the Iowa presidential caucuses, the first actual voting
of the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   The forum focused almost exclusively on issues of significance
to African Americans and Hispanics, including the Confederate
battle flag, affirmative action, immigration, health care, public
education, child poverty and the sweeping demographic changes the
United States is undergoing.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it occurred in Iowa, a state with a population that
is 97 percent white. But in the Southern states that dominate the
Democratic primaries in March, where the nomination is likely to be
decided, nearly one in three voters in Democratic primaries are
black.
</P>
<P>
   One exchange shifted away from issues and focused instead on two
controversial figures, Atlanta Braves pitcher John Rocker and the
Rev. Al Sharpton, a black activist in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates condemned the inflammatory remarks Rocker made
about minorities, gays and for in a Sports Illustrated
interview, but neither would rule out seeking the political support
of Sharpton, whose occasional anti-Semitic remarks have made him a
polarizing figure.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he had met earlier with Sharpton during a campaign
visit to Harlem, but said, ``I don't agree with Al Sharpton on
everything.'' Gore, who also has made a campaign trek to Sharpton's
church, said, ``We'll see how things go'' before making the trip
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know John Rocker and I don't want to know John
Rocker,'' said Bradley, a former pro basketball star whose racial
attitudes were formed largely by witnesses the discrimination to
which is black teammates were subjected in the 1960s and 1970s. ``I
wouldn't be disappointed if they fired him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore said Rocker could be ``on the road to receiving
forgiveness'' if he impresses more people like former Atlanta Mayor
Andrew Young and baseball homerun king Hank Aaron, both of whom
recently met in a counseling role with the Braves pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley largely agreed on most of the policy issues
that arose throughout the evening, although each defended his
health care plans as being more beneficial for minorities. A
proportion of minority Americans rely on government-subsidized
health programs.
</P>
<P>
   Both men also said the Confederate flag should be removed from
the state Capitol in South Carolina, but Gore said he would not
participate in an NAACP boycott of the state because ``I don't
think a president of the United States should ever boycott an
individual state.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, citing a poll showing a majority in South Carolina would
like the flag removed, added, ``It's only the Republican candidates
for president who are so scared of the extreme right wing, that
they will be tolerant of intolerance, less they offend the
offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said the flag ``offends our common humanity and it is
not the future of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The leading GOP hopefuls, Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona
Sen. John McCain, have said it is up to the residents of South
Carolina to decide whether the flag should fly atop their
statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley vowed to fill their administrations with
African Americans and Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore dodged a question about who among Latino leaders he
would consider for appointment to the Supreme Court. He said he
would make appointments that reflect ``the diversity of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said, ``I could never appoint someone who would turn the
clock back on civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men also said the father of Elian Gonzalez, a 6-year-old
Cuban boy at the center of an international dispute, should come to
the United States to press his claim for custody.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley sought to reassure African Americans about his proposal
to extend the 1964 Civil Rights Act to protect gays against
discrimination, an approach Gore opposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never do anything, anything that could possibly
undermine that act,'' Bradley said. ``But I don't think progress
for everyone means less progress for someone.''

ADVERTISING: AN EXCEPTION TO THE SUPER BOWL DOT-COMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stop the presses! Not every first-time advertiser on
the coming Super Bowl is a dot-com.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Madison Avenue has been calling Super Bowl XXXIV, to
be broadcast by ABC on Jan. 30, the ``dot-com bowl'' or the
``e-bowl.'' The reason: More than a dozen Internet companies are
scheduled to make their Super Bowl advertising debuts during the
game, compared with three in 1999 and one apiece in 1998 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The eagerness of dot-coms to parade themselves before what is
usually the largest viewing audience of the year helped drive ad
rates for Super Bowl XXXIV to a record average of more than $2
million for each 30-second spot during the game, at least 25
percent more than the 1999 rate. Some latecomers are paying up to
$3 million for their 30 seconds of fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a different objective from a lot of the advertisers
in the Super Bowl'' seeking ``to make a name for themselves,'' said
Roger Berdusco, senior vice president for marketing at Tropicana
Products in Bradenton, Fla., which will join the lengthy list of
initial advertisers dominated by such dot-coms as Autotrader.com,
Britannica.com, Computer.com, DowJones.com, OurBeginning.com and
Pets.com.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of those dot-coms, ``we have good awareness of our
brand,'' Berdusco said, adding: ``Our purpose is to seed a new
campaign with an important message. And what better way to expose
that message to a lot of people who would benefit from it than
kicking it off during the Super Bowl?''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, by the New York office of FCB Worldwide, part of
True North Communications, portrays the Tropicana Pure Premium
brand of orange juice as a quick, nutritional fuel for busy people.
The campaign, carrying the theme ``The best 9.3 seconds you can
possibly spend on yourself,'' will replace a 4-year-old effort that
characterized the brand as ``perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Having been involved in Super Bowl efforts before, I know it's
easy to be distracted,'' said Matt Fischer, senior vice president
and group creative director at FCB New York, an art director who
developed the Tropicana campaign with his copywriter partner, Rob
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Super Bowl can cause people to do stupid things,
especially in our business,'' Fischer said, referring to
extravagant commercials that ``are created mostly for entertainment
value'' rather than to offer ``a clear, cogent message'' about the
sponsor's brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you have to keep your eye on the ball, so to speak,'' he
added, which in this instance meant promoting the drinking of a
glass of Tropicana as ``an easy thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial to run during the Super Bowl, the first of four
planned by FCB, will present in high speed a sequence of events
that are part of a person's morning routine. The sped-up footage is
interrupted when the person drinks a glass of Tropicana in 9.3
seconds, which is shown in real time. That accomplished, the
footage reverts to the artificially faster pace as the spot ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a lot of research about the morning,'' Berdusco
said, which included data from ``consumers who let us put cameras
in their kitchens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 25 percent of people who have breakfast every morning
drink orange juice,'' he added, ``and even our superloyal users of
orange juice are not drinking it every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary reason for that, Berdusco said, was ``consumers who
are increasingly `morning-challenged,' with so many things to do,
pushing aside orange juice'' _ even though they are ``increasingly
concerned about nutrition.''
</P>
<P>
   So the idea was born, he added, to declare that ``you can't find
a more powerful form of convenient nutrition'' than Tropicana.
</P>
<P>
   What is the genesis of the 9.3-second figure, other than a
desire to have a quirky-sounding number in the commercial that
would be easy to remember? You may recall that Nestle once heralded
the inclusion of ``43 beans in every cup of new Nescafe'' instant
coffee and that Kellogg once promoted the ``two scoops of raisins
in every package of Kellogg's Raisin Bran,'' a figure that turned
up the other night as an answer on ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The number `9.3' had a good ring to it,'' Fischer said, ``and
we did some empirical testing by having some people at the agency
guzzle a glass and time them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken it to some focus groups,'' he added, ``and we've
gotten great response.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also a fiendishly clever and subtle dig in the ``9.3
seconds'' pitch, aimed at Tropicana's principal competitor, the
Minute Maid brand of orange juice sold by Coca-Cola Co. The
implication is that 9.3 seconds is faster _ and therefore better _
than a minute, a word that occurs frequently in the current Minute
Maid campaign, which carries the theme ``Squeeze the day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tropicana foray into the Super Bowl comes a year and a half
after the brand was acquired by PepsiCo, a mainstay Super Sunday
marketer for Pepsi-Cola Co. soft drinks and Frito-Lay snacks.
</P>
<P>
   The PepsiCo ownership ``played no part at all'' in Tropicana's
arrival onto the Super Bowl ad field, said Berdusco, who until six
months ago was supervising the marketing department for the North
American division of Frito-Lay.
</P>
<P>
   Having overseen Super Bowl spots for snacks like Cracker Jack,
Doritos and Rold Gold, ``I'm familiar with the Super Bowl as a
media platform,'' he added, ``and it's a great way to get your
message out to so many consumers at one time,'' dot-com clutter or
not.
</P>
<P>
   The other PepsiCo units have varied ad plans for the Super Bowl.
Pepsi-Cola is likely to take two minutes of commercial time for
Mountain Dew _ that brand's first appearance during the game _ and
perhaps one other brand. Frito-Lay is sponsoring the pregame show
and is not expected to run spots during the game itself.

 &HT;    Demonstrators try to distinguish between heritage, hate in S.C.
flag flap
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ A civil rights army of 46,000 demonstrators
marched Monday on South Carolina's Statehouse _ hallowed ground for
the Confederate flag _ and demanded the divisive banner be removed
from atop the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring the peaceful Martin Luther King Jr. Day rally the
``greatest demonstration against the symbol of bigotry and hatred''
in 40 years, NAACP President Kweisi Mfume vowed further
demonstrations if South Carolina legislators refuse to furl the
Confederate flag.
</P>
<P>
   This month the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People launched a tourism boycott of South Carolina until
the flag comes down. Monday, amid the impassioned speeches, the
head of the state's black coaches association announced another
step intended to pressure legislators.
</P>
<P>
   C. Timothy Stoner, executive director, said the coaches group
had urged the National Collegiate Athletic Association to refrain
from scheduling tournaments in South Carolina until legislators
remove the flag and declare King's birthday a state holiday.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina is the only state that doesn't officially
recognize the national King holiday. State workers can take the day
off on the King holiday or another of their choice, including one
of several tied to Confederate anniversaries.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina is also the last state to fly the Confederate
flag atop its state capitol.
</P>
<P>
   That combination has turned South Carolina into an ideological
battleground, 139 years after Confederate soldiers fired on Fort
Sumter in Charleston's harbor and started the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days ago, 6,000 flag supporters rallied in Columbia. Their
leaders vowed to pressure legislators to keep the rebel flag
flying, as it has since 1962 when legislators raised it as part of
a Civil War centennial.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Monday's protest in Columbia, David Robinson, 38, said
he couldn't ''believe they have nothing better to do than protest
the flag.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The flag doesn't represent hate,'' said Robinson, from
Trenton, S.C. ''It is heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   But speaker after speaker denounced the Confederate flag as an
insulting relic that demands immediate attention.
</P>
<P>
   Some cited a recent remark by state Sen. Arthur Ravenel (R-Mount
Pleasant). During the flag supporters' rally, he referred to the
NAACP as the ''National Association for Retarded People.'' When
asked to apologize, he apologized to the mentally disabled, not to
the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't wait because it symbolizes racism and shame,'' the
Rev. Lewis Graham, pastor of Zion Baptist Church in Columbia, said
Monday. ''We can't wait because the blood of Martin cries out in us
now that it ought to come down.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Evans, 55, drove from his home in Decatur, Ga., to
protest a symbol that he said ''belongs in the museum. It is the
new millennium, the year 2000, and that is old history.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans predicted ''once they take this one down, Georgia will
follow.''
</P>
<P>
   An Atlanta civil rights leader, in fact, has vowed to draw
Georgia into the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Beasley, the Southern regional director for the Rainbow/PUSH
Coalition, said he is bringing together civil rights groups in
Atlanta to call for a tourism boycott of Georgia until legislators
remove the Confederate emblem from the state flag.
</P>
<P>
   A rally announcing the boycott is planned for Jan. 30 during the
Super Bowl in Atlanta, Beasley said. He added the coalition's
president, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, has not endorsed the boycott,
but he expects Jackson to participate in the rally if he attends
the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   An attempt to reach Jackson at the coalition's offices in
Chicago on Monday night wasn't successful.
</P>
<P>
   As South Carolina's flag fight has drawn in presidential
candidates, Beasley said Monday he plans to contact Vice President
Al Gore's campaign headquarters in Nashville, Tenn., and ask that
he speak out against the Georgia flag.
</P>
<P>
   In a weekend TV interview with Jackson, Gore said the
Confederate flag represents for ''many Americans a hurtful message
that recalls the pain of slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's turnout in Columbia exceeded the expectations of
organizers, including the NAACP, the Urban Leagues in Columbia and
Upstate South Carolina and several church groups. The long list of
speakers included Columbia Mayor Bob Coble and Charleston Mayor Joe
Riley, who said the flag should be removed and put in ''a place of
honor and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   As the speeches dragged on, some in the crowd grew restless. But
they snapped to attention when NAACP President Mfume stood at the
lectern, next to a statue of George Washington holding a broken
cane. It had been damaged by Gen. Sherman's invading Union troops
in 1865.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have come to the state of South Carolina to say that
bigotry, racism and racist symbols _ whether a Confederate flag or
burning crosses _ will not be allowed to go unchallenged,'' Mfume
told the cheering crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The march and rally lasted more than five hours, during which
police reported one arrest for disorderly conduct: A man carrying a
large Confederate flag with a sign that said ``I love you''
exchanged words with people in the crowd and ignored police
requests to back off. There also were a small number of fainting
episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the aroma of fish frying and ribs barbecuing, the packed
crowd spilled from the Statehouse grounds onto Main Street. Police
looked on from the ground and rooftops. Wooden barricades and
volunteer marshals with locked arms lined the parade route from
Zion Baptist Church to the capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Though predominantly black, the crowd drew some white people and
a large number of school children whose classes had been canceled
because of local observance of the King holiday.
</P>
<P>
   As people assembled around the red-brick church in the morning
chill, leaders inside exhorted the crowd in the sanctuary to ''fire
it up'' but to do it peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   Led by youngsters from Clover, S.C., the parade moved slowly,
stretching and collapsing like an accordion along a route that
passed the beauty parlors and vacant storefronts of Washington
Street. Turning on to Main, the crowd grew thicker. Leaders began
singing, ''I got a feeling the flag's coming down in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   People carried placards reading, ''Your heritage is my slavery''
and ''It's time to look ahead. The Confederacy is dead.'' Another
read, ''The days of Yes'um' are over. Take the flag down.''
</P>
<P>
   A gathering of 3,000 waiting at the Statehouse erupted into
cheers as the procession reached the tall monument to the
Confederate war dead. People clamored up and stood on the side of
the statue, unveiled in 1879 by South Carolina women.
</P>
<P>
   One man waved a flag of red, black and green _ the colors of
African liberation _ as he perched on the statue. Atop it, a stone
figure of a rebel soldier faced away from the impassioned speech
making.
</P>
<P>
   At day's end, the wind stretched out the Confederate flag in
full view, flying beneath the American flag and the South Carolina
state flag.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all still have the dream,'' said marcher Inese Bonapart,
47, of Swanson, S.C. ''I am hoping that we will make a
difference.''

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Motorola Inc. showed more evidence Monday that it is
in the middle of a remarkable turnaround by reporting a big jump in
fourth-quarter profits on growing demand for its cellular
telephones and semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which just a year ago was laying off thousands of
workers and trying to reorganize its operations after huge losses,
has become a Wall Street darling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This looks pretty solid,'' said Brian Modoff, an analyst at
Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown. ``There's clearly a trend toward higher
profits, because wireless is one of the fastest-growing markets out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock market was closed Monday, but shares of Motorola
soared $11.25 on Friday, to $151 a share, on expectations of a
strong showing Monday, and Motorola delivered just that, posting a
profit of 82 cents a share, excluding special items, a penny better
than Wall Street forecasts and up from about 26 cents a share in
the period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola had an operating profit of $514 million, or 82 cents a
share, compared with $159 million, or 26 cents a share in the
fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which reported sales of $8.5 billion in the fourth
quarter, with $7.9 billion from continuing operations, is
benefiting from soaring worldwide demand for cellular telephones
and strong growth in the semiconductor market.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, investors who had dragged the stock down to about
$40 a share a year ago, have in the last year bid it up to an
all-time high in a frenzy of buying that has been largely built on
optimism that the company is reasserting itself as a leading
developer of cellular handsets.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are also optimistic about the company's effort to
recast itself by developing new hardware platforms and a broad
array of software applications that are expected to be critical
components in the convergence of the Internet and wireless
communications devices.
</P>
<P>
   The new Motorola _ as its chief executive, Christopher Galvin,
calls it _ is betting that an increasingly wired world is going to
be dependent on a growing array of wireless communications devices
and a growing number of microchips that link up and communicate
with one another. It is a development that one Motorola executive
calls the ``trillion device problem,'' one that Motorola aims to be
at the center of.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're focusing on access technology,'' Modoff said, ``the
ability for you to access information whether it's at home through
cable modems or through wireless devices, and the ability to
control all kinds of devices from remote locations.''
</P>
<P>
   To stake out its ground in the wired world, Motorola, which is
based in Schaumburg, Ill., has moved swiftly in the last year,
forging alliances with Cisco Systems Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc.
to develop a new wireless infrastructure capable of delivering
high-speed Internet access, and acquiring, for more than $11
billion, General Instrument, a leading maker of cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola is also trying to expand its microchip franchise by
promoting semiconductors that power all kinds of devices, chips
that are planted in cars, in toasters, in high-definition
televisions, in lighting systems and more. The company even started
a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign touting its ``digital
DNA,'' which it calls the ``heart of smart'' technology.
</P>
<P>
   One of the clouds hanging over Motorola, however, has been
Iridium LLC, the $5 billion satellite telephone venture that filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection late last year. Motorola has
already taken huge charges because of its big investment in the
project, which it helped create, and on Monday the company
announced another $740 million write-off associated with Iridium.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola also remains in fierce competition with Nokia, the
Finnish cellular-telephone maker, which is the market leader. And
Motorola is trying to revive its cellular infrastructure unit,
which also fell behind a year ago by making a big bet on analog
technology when the world was turning to digital technology.
</P>
<P>
   The company's fortunes have now turned. Cellular telephones are
taking off because of soaring demand around the world. (Herschel
Shosteck &AMP; Associates projects sales of about 360 million handsets
this year.) Chips are recovering from a slowdown in parts of Asia,
and even Motorola's flagging cellular infrastructure division is
showing signs of recovery in the fourth-quarter report.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola executives have also moved to give the company a higher
profile, by introducing new consumer products, like two-way radios
for children and a watch pager developed with Timex. The company
has agreed to spend about $60 million over the next three years to
be the official wireless communications sponsor of the National
Football League.
</P>
<P>
   And Motorola is trying to bring new wireless technologies _
including Internet access _ to automobiles, and has already signed
pacts and released products in cars like the Mercedes-Benz.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After making a bad bet on analog technology over digital,
Motorola has tried to seize upon the Internet and has begun
developing devices, including cellular telephones, that deliver
Internet access. And the company has, in effect, tried to hedge its
bets by making more bets.
</P>
<P>
   The new Motorola has a new line of jazzy cellular telephones, to
compete with the stylish Nokia phones. It has pagers, microchips
and cable modems; it's under the dashboard, in your toaster, your
high-definition television sets; it's in the 3Com Palm Pilot and
Apple's MacIntosh computer. The company even built satellites for
Iridium.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Teledesic LLC, the global satellite network
that aims to become a kind of ``Internet in the sky,'' with the
help of Motorola satellite technology.
</P>
<P>
   The message is that Motorola is highly diversified and prepared
for the Internet revolution. And so far, despite an array of nimble
and fierce competitors like Nokia, Lucent and even Microsoft, Wall
Street analysts and investors are buying it.

   DOLLAR SLIPS AGAINST YEN
</P>
<P>
   Most major foreign stock markets ended higher while U.S. markets
were closed in observance of Martin Luther King's Birthday. The
dollar edged up against the euro but slipped against the Japanese
yen in overseas trading.
</P>
<P>
   The gains in European stocks were led by telecommunications
companies. In Frankfurt, Germany, the Dax index rose 85.68 points,
or 1.19 percent, to 7,258.90, its second consecutive record close.
And in Tokyo the Nikkei 225 stock average rose 480.68 points, or
2.5 percent, to 19,437.23, its highest close in two and a half
years. The French CAC-40 index and the Ibex 35 index in Spain
closed up nearly 1 percent.

<P>
   The Brazilian economy has recovered from its currency crisis of
a year ago with record inflows of $28 billion in foreign direct

   REPORT CHALLENGES BERTELSMANN
</P>
<P>
   A year after Bertelsmann, the German media conglomerate,
appointed an independent group of scholars to examine its disputed
history during the Nazi era, the commission issued a preliminary
report that took issue with corporate lore that the Nazis closed
the publishing company because of its political opposition. The
four-member commission's tentative conclusion was that Bertelsmann
was closed simply because its product was not considered critically
important for the war effort.

   American Girl Place, since opening in Chicago's most expensive
shopping district in 1998, has drawn 750,000 girls and women (and a

usually the largest viewing audience of the year helped drive ad
rates for Super Bowl XXXIV to a record average of more than $2
million for each 30-second spot during the game, at least 25
percent more than the 1999 rate. Some latecomers are paying up to
$3 million for their 30 seconds of fame.

ABROSIMOVA LEADS UCONN TO 65-50 TRIUMPH OVER RUTGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ In the first minute of Monday's game, as
Rutgers began its surge to a surprising 9-point lead, Svetlana
Abrosimova of Connecticut took an elbow to the nose from Tammy
Sutton-Brown of Rutgers as they fought for a rebound. Abrosimova
blinked and looked quizzically at the big center of the Scarlet
Knights. With second-ranked Tennessee having been upset earlier in
the day, was this a hint that the second shoe was about to fall
with Rutgers toppling the top-ranked and undefeated Huskies?
</P>
<P>
   No way. After a brief rest, Abrosimova returned to the game and
to her forward position. Later in the half, starting with four
minutes to play and two of Rutgers' top players on the bench,
Abrosimova and her Connecticut teammates returned the surge with 17
unanswered points to take an 8-point halftime lead. In the second
half, the Huskies never let Rutgers get closer than 6 points as
they rolled to a 65-50 victory before 16,294 at the Hartford Civic
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Although several Huskies (15-0, 5-0 Big East) contributed, none
were as dominant as Abrosimova, a lanky junior from St. Petersburg,
Russia. She led all scorers with 20 points, shooting jumpers from
long range and slashing along the baseline. She grabbed five
rebounds and crashed to the floor many times in struggles for loose
balls against Rutgers (11-4, 4-2), which had fallen from 9th to
11th in the Associated Press poll after last week's loss to
Villanova.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has more competitiveness than she does,'' Huskies coach
Geno Auriemma said of Abrosimova. ``She understands at all times
when the game is being decided. She's always in the middle of a lot
of stuff that happens. You can't teach that. You can't coach that.
She has it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Abrosimova said she didn't understand why her coach rested her
so early. ``It wasn't because of that,'' she said, referring to the
elbow. ``When I came back, I tried to play the best I could.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her team was not rattled by Rutgers' early rally. ``We
still knew we were going to have our own run,'' Abrosimova said.
``We just waited for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her coach seemed slightly amused that Abrosimova reported no
problem from the elbow. ``She took a pretty good shot to the face,
it looked like it staggered her a little bit,'' he said. ``I said,
`Is something bothering you? Why did you go all the way down and
sit next to the trainer?' Mixed messages, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Sue Bird had 13 points and 5 assists for the Huskies, and
Swintayla Cash added 11 points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   For Rutgers, Shawnetta Stewart had 13 points and 5 rebounds, and
Tasha Pointer, the other starting guard, had 13 rebounds and 9
points. Sutton-Brown, a dominating presence near the basket, had 7
points and 5 rebounds in the first half, but no points and just 2
rebounds in the second half. Rutgers Coach C.Vivian Stringer was
asked about resting Sutton-Brown, who had two fouls, and Stewart,
who had three, during the Connecticut comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have quality substitutions,'' the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart added, ``I wanted to be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Stringer and her players said they were not content to play well
on Connecticut's home court and go home with a respectable defeat.
Stringer said of the Huskies: ``They're the best, there's no
question about that. They've got great balance. They are extremely
bright. It's Connecticut and everybody else. I want to leave with a
smile sometime after a game like this. But I don't want to drop my
head.''
</P>
<P>
   Her players played with determination and aggression, outfouling
Connecticut, 21-10. ``I don't have anything to say about the
officials,'' Stringer said. ``Make sure you say that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The last of those fouls came with one second left. It was the
fifth against Linda Miles, who intentionally crashed Shea Ralph to
the floor. Ralph, who scored only 9 points and watched the
first-half rally from the bench, said Rutgers might have been
motivated by its loss to Villanova.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably, if anything, it made them angrier,'' Ralph said,
making the Scarlet Knights want to ``beat somebody up and make
somebody pay for it.'' &QL;

BERLIN MAYOR TO SKIP DEDICATION OF HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL, ANGERING
MANY 
</HEADLINE>
 (Subs 4th graf to add description of Elie Wiesel, `the author...')

 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Eberhard Diepgen, the mayor of Berlin, has decided not
to attend the dedication ceremony next week for a large Holocaust
memorial near the Brandenburg Gate, a project he has long opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Diepgen has said his agenda was too full to attend the ceremony
on Jan. 27, although he has declined to specify what his other
engagements are.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Naumann, Germany's senior cultural official, said:
``This is a significant ceremony demonstrating the fact that the
memorial will be built. I am very surprised that Diepgen is not
coming and hope he will change his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony, to be attended by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder,
President Johannes Rau and Elie Wiesel, the author and holocaust
historian, is intended to put to rest a decade of tumultuous debate
over a memorial that will combine a field of more than 2,000 stone
pillars and a ``documentation center'' whose exact form and
character remain murky.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has revealed deep differences over the place of
memory in a society now two generations removed from the Nazi era,
and over the image of the new city being built on land once
occupied by the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Diepgen has argued that the memorial is too big and impossible
to protect. Officials close to him have suggested that it may be
unnecessary in a city that already has several smaller monuments
commemorating the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   By its position and size, the memorial, by the New York
architect Peter Eisenman, will be a dominant feature of the city.
It is to be built at a time when many Germans feel that the country
has done enough to commemorate, confront and pay compensation for
the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Michael-Andreas Butz, the spokesman for the mayor, did not
return several telephone calls seeking comment. In statements to
the German press, he has said the mayor is far too busy, may not
have been invited, and will in any event be represented by another
senior Christian Democratic politician.
</P>
<P>
   Naumann said he was sure that the mayor had been invited and
that his absence from the ceremony would be unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
   American officials, already in a conflict with Diepgen over
security for a new American Embassy in Berlin, expressed irritation
at the mayor's decision. John Kornblum, the American ambassador, is
to attend the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang Thierse, the speaker of Parliament, has described the
ceremony as the ``symbolic start of the memorial's construction.''
But building at the vast site is not expected to begin until next
year at the earliest because financing and some architectural
details have not been completed.
</P>
<P>
   It also emerged late last year that a small corner of the site
was still owned by a municipal housing company, and the status of
that piece of land has to be resolved. Because discussion over it
will involve the city government, and because Diepgen is not
enthusiastic, the talks could take some time.
</P>
<P>
   The city will also be largely responsible for construction of
the project. It remains unclear when the memorial, whose cost is
estimated at $26 million, will be completed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because of those remaining difficulties with a project approved
last year by Parliament, officials have decided to refrain from a
groundbreaking ceremony. Rather, large signs in German and English
will be unveiled at the dedication showing what the memorial will
be and explaining its significance.
</P>
<P>
   As other buildings around the 4.9-acre empty lot have moved
toward completion in the last year, this large hole in the heart of
Berlin has become increasingly conspicuous, prompting occasional
exasperated suggestions that the best memorial would be simply to
leave the site vacant.
</P>
<P>
   Delays have also emerged at the city's new Jewish Museum, which
was to have opened later this year. Problems with the
air-conditioning system and other technical features of the
building by Daniel Libeskind, an American architect, have pushed
the opening back to 2001.

<P>
   SUNSET VALLEY, Texas _ Sandwiched between the sparsely populated
Texas hill country and the sprawling city of Austin, this community
of 327 people sits on the line between new and old versions of the
Lone Star state. To the east rise the office buildings of an urban
high technology center; to the west, rolling ranch land stocked
with cattle, and beyond, the flat prairies of Big Oil.
</P>
<P>
   And just beneath the limestone soil of Sunset Valley's quiet
suburban neighborhoods runs another line, a 50-year-old,
700-mile-long oil pipeline that some say represents a grave
environmental threat and others contend holds environmental and
economic benefits just waiting to be tapped.
</P>
<P>
   The differing views say much about how Texas has changed since
the pipeline was built, and about the oil industry's declining
influence.
</P>
<P>
   For more than five years, Longhorn Partners Pipeline Co. has
been trying to convert the pipeline from its former function,
pumping crude oil from Houston to West Texas refineries, to a new
use, carrying cleaner-burning gasoline to El Paso, a city under
federal air quality sanctions. From there, the gasoline would go to
New Mexico and Arizona. The result, Longhorn says, would be cleaner
air for El Paso and reduced fuel costs for Southwest motorists who
have historically paid some of the nation's highest gasoline
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline has been dormant since it was bought for $325
million in 1995 by Longhorn, a partnership of Exxon, Amoco and
other oil interests.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say moving gasoline rather than less-volatile crude
oil through the aged line poses risks of explosions and fires for
thousands of people living near it. They also say spills from the
pipeline could threaten lakes and the ecologically fragile Edwards
Aquifer, an underground network of spring-fed catacombs that
provides water to 45,000 Central Texas residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about pitting one area against another,'' said
Jeff Jacks, an Austin neighborhood leader. ``El Paso needs cleaner
gas for their air quality problems, and so we end up shipping
gasoline across our aquifer. None of it makes much sense.''
</P>
<P>
   J.J. Pickle, a Democrat who represented this area in Congress
for 31 years until 1994, says he cannot remember a similar
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty years ago things like this pipeline were just
automatic,'' Pickle said. ``People didn't think there was another
side to putting in pipelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Longhorn has agreed to a long list of protective measures as a
condition for reopening the line. But officials here have vowed to
fight the move, insisting that the line be re-routed around the
Edwards Aquifer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message is very direct, put this pipeline somewhere else,''
Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat who replaced Pickle, said last week
at a meeting that drew 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Oil and Texas have been synonymous since the Old Spindletop
field was discovered in East Texas in 1901. The state has 250,000
miles of underground oil and gas pipelines, more than any other,
said Gene Acuna of the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates
the network.
</P>
<P>
   Local sensitivities to pipeline safety were heightened by an
explosion on a pipeline in Bellingham, Wash., that killed three
people in June 1999. And on Thursday a $35 million settlement was
announced between the federal government and Koch Industries of
Wichita, Kan., arising from oil spills in rural areas. Texas will
receive $17.5 million of that settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't think much about them until there's an accident
or a controversy,'' Acuna said, ``but the state is literally
crisscrossed with pipelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1993 and 1996 there were 614 incidents involving
pipeline safety along the 150,000 miles of intrastate lines
regulated by his office, Acuna said, and three reported fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   With high technology now driving the Texas economy, oil is no
longer king. In the 1950s, when the Longhorn pipeline was built,
oil represented over a quarter of Texas' total economic output and
employed 233,000 Texans, more than 10 percent of the state's work
force.
</P>
<P>
   Oil and gas have slipped to 11.9 percent of the state's gross
product and 3 percent of the state's work force. By comparison, the
high-tech industry employs over 100,000 in Austin alone and more
than 500,000 statewide. The technology industry has surpassed oil's
role in the economy and now totals 12.5 percent of the state's
gross product, the state Comptroller's Office said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our real economic resource is not minerals, but our quality of
life,'' Doggett said. ``Our quality of life is what attracts the
talented people. And you cannot get those people if you are next to
a smelly oil well or a potentially exploding or leaking pipeline.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Martin, a spokesman for Longhorn, counters that it would
take 12,000 tanker trucks to move the volume of gasoline that would
be transported by the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you tell me which represents the greater environmental and
quality-of-life risk: an underground pipeline that no one ever sees
or 12,000 tanker trucks in the street?'' Martin asked.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute illustrates the declining influence of the oil
industry, Pickle said. But just as important, he said, is the
growth in agencies and laws to protect the environment. ``It's not
just that the oil industry has gotten weaker, but that the citizens
and the environmental groups have gotten so much stronger and
better organized,'' he said.

AFTER VAN HORN'S MISSTEPS, NETS FALL TO SIXERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The preferred play had broken down, and it was up
to Keith Van Horn to create another. With the New Jersey Nets
trailing by 3 points and victory or defeat hinging on his move, he
had two options _ get to the basket fast for a quick score or
drive, draw attention and find a teammate on the perimeter for a
3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   When Van Horn began penetrating the lane from the top of the
key, the options swirling in his head, the ball slipped from his
right hand and into the grasp of the Philadelphia 76ers' George
Lynch. A lead pass to the streaking Allen Iverson for a game-ending
dunk emphatically sealed the Philadelphia victory and Nets defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The final score was 101-96 Monday at the First Union Center. The
final vision was of Van Horn committing his eighth turnover of the
day with the game hanging in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right when I got down to the point of making the decision I
became indecisive, and that's when the ball slipped out of my
hands,'' said Van Horn, who had 20 points and a game-high 14
rebounds. ``You can't be indecisive at that moment. You just have
to make the right play. I just tried to think a little too much
instead of just playing basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment that I went up to shoot, I saw George Lynch step in
and I went to pick it up to kick it out to Scott Burrell, and
that's when the ball came out. I take full responsibility for
losing the ballgame there.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn appeared to be going for a 2-point basket, which would
have left the Nets, who had no timeouts remaining, with little
chance to get the ball back and score again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad play,'' coach Don Casey said. ``I'll talk to him
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the second consecutive game in which the Nets foiled
themselves in the waning moments. In Saturday's 99-96 loss to
Boston, Kendall Gill threw away an inbounds pass with 18 seconds
remaining, thwarting the Nets' last opportunity. Monday, the Nets
failed to get a 3-point attempt when trailing by 99-96 with nine
seconds remaining. Neither Stephon Marbury, Kerry Kittles nor
Burrell could get open to receive a pass from Johnny Newman, which
put the ball in the hands of Van Horn, the last resort.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yet after dropping to 15-22, the Nets were not hard on
themselves in the locker room. The felt they had played a tough,
solid game and done well to give themselves a chance to defeat the
surging 76ers (22-16) on their home floor. One of the league's
hottest teams, Philadelphia has won 5 of its last 6 games and 8 of
its last 10 since falling to the Nets at Continental Arena on Dec.
23.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nets, with their owners Lewis Katz and Finn Wentworth
watching from courtside seats, did plenty wrong. Casey elected to
play his rebounding fiend, Jamie Feick, only 23 minutes because he
thought Jim McIlvaine and Michael Cage were playing stronger post
defense, and the result was Philadelphia dominance on the
backboards.
</P>
<P>
   Just a mediocre rebounding club, Philadelphia outrebounded the
Nets by 51-36 and outscored them by 20-7 in second-chance points.
On top of that, the jump shot-loving Nets attempted 25 3-pointers
but hit only 7. Marbury led the Nets with 31 points and 9 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, which was led by Iverson's 34 points, looked set
to cruise after building an 82-70 by the final minute of the third
period. But the Nets employed the surprising weapon of Lucious
Harris to get back in contention.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, a 6-foot-5-inch guard and former 76er, used his size
against the 6-foot Iverson to hit five straight baskets and score
10 of the Nets' first 11 points of the fourth quarter. His final
basket, an 18-footer, pulled the Nets within 88-87 with 6 minutes
41 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia went back ahead by 6 points, but the Nets moved
within 96-93 and had a chance to scoot closer when Kittles grabbed
a rebound and kicked it to Marbury streaking on a fast break.
Marbury, who penetrated successfully all day, drove again, but
Aaron McKie knocked the ball out of his hands with 54.4 seconds
remaining, and Eric Snow recovered. Caseythought Marbury deserved
a foul call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to the officials that somehow I feel if Iverson was
breaking away for a layup, there would have been a foul called,''
said Casey, questioning the officials publicly for the first time
this season. ``My guy doesn't get a foul call. That was a huge
play. Whether it was a foul or not, I just have a feeling that, to
Iverson's credit so to speak, he would have gotten the call. Our
little guy gets the stuff kicked out of him all the time and hardly
ever gets a call.''
</P>
<P>
   After Philadelphia's Theo Ratliff made one of two free throws,
Marbury gave the Nets a chance by sinking a 3-pointer that made it
97-96 with 10.6 seconds to play. McKie followed with two free
throws, and then, after a Nets timeout, the ball and the big
decision were left to Van Horn.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff, who blocked three shots and intimidated on numerous
others, said Van Horn, who had his season high for turnovers, was
thinking about more than his options on that final play.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know he heard me coming,'' the 6-10 Ratliff said, joking
somewhat. ``He knows I'm going to challenge every shot. He knows
there ain't going to be any plain looks.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there was no look at all for the Nets. &QL;

 &HT;    A meeting of minds on this King holiday
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ It was reported last week that Maytag Corp.
is considering moving its headquarters out of Iowa, in part because
the state doesn't have enough diversity. This relatively
homogeneous state might seem an odd place, then, to hold a debate
on racial issues.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, the added draw of next week's caucuses, which
assured at least that both Democratic candidates would show up at
the Brown-Black Forum, held at a high school in a racially mixed
area of this city.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore is counting on minority votes to help him
win not only the nomination but the election, and former Sen. Bill
Bradley has made racial healing the cornerstone of his campaign. So
it was not surprising that the two had few real disagreements about
civil rights policy.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate did reveal substantial differences in the way the
two Democrats approach what moderator Tavis Smiley called ``the
all-important issue of race in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore cast himself at every turn as the pragmatist, and in this
forum, unlike some other, the vice president didn't hesitate to
hold up the record of the Clinton administration. Bradley, on the
other hand, presented himself as the candidate ost willing to
think outside the box, as a visionary for whom not even the record
of this administration, so popular with African-American voters, is
good enough.
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of racial profiling, for instance, Bradley said
Gore should march into the Oval Office and demand that Bill Clinton
sign an executive order banning the practice. Clinton, Gore
retorted, didn't need ``a lecture from Bill Bradley'' on how to
fight for minorities.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, there could hardly be a debate on race without a
John Rocker question.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he ``wouldn't be disappointed'' if the Braves fired
Rocker, and said the Atlanta squad should emulate his old team, the
Knicks. Gore repudiated Rocker's remarks, but related what he'd
heard earlier in the day in Atlanta from Andrew Young, whose
eloquence on this overworked subject is as yet unmatched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think America is all about redemption,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   This debate was notable for being the first in memory in which a
candidate agreed with a heckler. When an environmental activist
interrupted the forum to shout something about global warming, Gore
remarked that while he didn't like her tactics, she had ``a pretty
good point.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also one nugget of news in this debate, at least for
those who have not paid attention to what the Democratic candidates
have had to say about the Elian Gonzalez case.
</P>
<P>
   Given the chance, neither was willing to stand squarely behind
Attorney General Janet Reno's decision that the boy should be sent
back to his Cuban father. If anything, Gore was a little more vocal
in his waffling than Bradley, speculating that the father may be
intimidated by the demonstrations held outside his home by Cubans
demanding the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
   The very next question was whether the same philosophy should
apply to Chinese, or Haitian, or Mexican children _ which
illustrates just what a slippery slope the Gonzalez case rests on.
</P>
<P>
   The question also illustrates just how broad the subject of
civil rights has become. On this first King holiday to be
celebrated in all 50 states, many of the answers propounded by the
late civil rights leader have become an accepted part of the
national canon. But today, those answers are being connected with a
far wider variety of questions.

U.N. CHOOSES EX-ARMS INSPECTOR TO HEAD IRAQ MONITORING PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Rolf Ekeus, the Swedish arms control expert who
found and destroyed large quantities of Iraqi weapons after the war
in 1991 in the Persian Gulf, was called back on Monday by
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to lead a new commission created to
finish the job more than a year after monitoring broke down.
</P>
<P>
   Annan made the appointment after a deadline on Sunday came and
went for the Security Council to come up with its own nomination.
But in naming Ekeus without achieving consensus in the council, the
secretary-general was in effect daring Iraq's supporters on the
council, particularly Russia and China, to veto his choice.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has long criticized Ekeus, who headed the U.N.
arms-inspection team from 1991 to 1997, and ridiculed his selection
as ``old wine in a new bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday evening, Russia formally registered its objections,
throwing the nomination of Ekeus, now Sweden's ambassador to the
United States, into doubt and setting up a confrontation between
Washington and Moscow. China, increasingly ready to take a cue from
the Russians, may also weigh in against the appointment. The French
could then break ranks with Britain and other European countries
that support the American position.
</P>
<P>
   It is a situation that the Clinton administration has, by most
accounts, sought desperately to avoid in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council is to take up the issue at 3 p.m. on
Tuesday, diplomats said. There are concerns among council
delegations that friends of Iraq, led by Russia, intend to make
this discussion into what American politicians would recognize as a
filibuster. By stalling action on a new inspection system, they
could indefinitely postpone any resolution of the Iraq crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, support for economic sanctions is steadily eroding,
most of all in Russia and France, where business interests are
paramount.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since the invasion of Kuwait
in August 1990. To have them lifted, it has to meet disarmament
requirements in biological, chemical, nuclear and missile systems.
But officials here predict that additional nations may be tempted
to expand commercial interests in Iraq, which is selling oil at
record prices under a more generous program intended to provide
civilians with needed goods. Iraq's recent history would indicate
that it will try to use the cover of civilian imports to acquire
material for weapons.
</P>
<P>
   A Security Council resolution on Dec. 17 to revise U.N. policy
toward Iraq and send arms inspectors back to the country stipulated
that a new chief arms inspector be named in 30 days. Annan had
spent several weeks steering through multiple objections to a long
list of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over 30 days, he raised something like 25 names and could not
find one on which all could agree,'' Annan's spokesman, Fred
Eckhard, said. ``So he put forward the name of the person he
thought best for the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Ekeus was chosen with at least the tacit approval, if not on the
urging of the Clinton administration, some U.N. officials and
diplomats say. His appointment was quickly applauded by the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thank the secretary-general for his exhaustive efforts to
find a candidate who meets the rigorous criteria necessary to carry
out this important disarmament mission,'' a statement by a
spokesman for the State Department, James P. Foley, said. Some
diplomats and officials, who have watched the administration
steadily withdraw from involvement on the Iraqi issue here, said
with Ekeus in place administration officials could assure critics
that a credible chief inspector was back on the job, even if
sanctions were ultimately lifted in the process.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both Congress and the administration have had disagreements with
Annan in the past over his handling of Iraq, in particular his trip
to Baghdad in February 1998. That was even though the agreement
that he signed there ended a stalemate over inspections, sparing
the United States from having to take military action then.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Washington also objected to two of Annan's appointees in
Iraq, saying they were too sympathetic to the government.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, diplomats and arms-control experts have said
that Annan could not afford to be seen as giving in to Iraq on a
new inspector.
</P>
<P>
   Managing the issue now lies with the president of the Security
Council this month, Richard C. Holbrooke. On Monday, Holbrooke, who
has largely stayed clear of Iraq since his arrival in August as the
American representative, gave council members 24 hours to study
Annan's nomination of Ekeus and decide whether they would challenge
it. Russia was the first to raise an objection.
</P>
<P>
   Had there been no objections, Ekeus would have automatically
become executive chairman of the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, too, immediately attacked the nomination. Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz, who is visiting Spain, called the move
dishonest. For several weeks the Iraqis, apparently expecting a
more conciliatory gesture from the secretary-general, have been
harshly critical of Annan in the controlled Iraqi press. While
serving as chief inspector in Iraq from 1991 to 1997, Ekeus was
routinely vilified by the Iraqis, who called him ``the damned
Ekeus'' and accused him of, among other things, causing the
starvation of Iraqi children and being an Israeli spy.
</P>
<P>
   In his low-keyed, methodic way, Ekeus kept up the pressure on
Iraq in a protracted game of cat and mouse. He sent divers to the
depths of a canal to find illegally imported missile parts that the
Iraqis had hurriedly jettisoned. He documented a nuclear program
larger than atomic weapons experts had imagined existed. He
badgered Iraq on its unacceptable accounting for biological warfare
materials until literally cartons of damning information were
suddenly ``found'' on a chicken farm _ and still he wasn't
satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at the end of his tenure in June 1997, Ekeus
said that Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, never gave up plans to
build biological and chemical weapons, and that the Iraqis were
prepared to lie at every step of the inspection process to conceal
and salvage their illicit programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell the most incredible stories,'' Ekeus said. ``It's
like the `Thousand and One Nights,' where every night they tell a
different story to save themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Ekeus was criticized, however, for agreeing in 1996 to Iraqi
demands for restrictions on inspections at some sites close to the
Iraqi leadership. Some arms control experts say that, from that
moment on, Iraq steadily widened the wedge of ``unacceptable''
searches and ``off limits'' sites, barring inspectors from
presidential palaces and ministerial offices where they suspected
documents and equipment might have been hidden.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Butler, the Australian arms control expert who followed
Ekeus as chairman of the first disarmament commission, known as
UNSCOM, inherited a fast-unraveling inspection system and
ultimately lost the support of the Clinton administration in
efforts to stand up to the Iraqis.

 &HT;    NFC Notebook: Bucs expect loud crowd to be factor
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy was asked Monday if
crowd noise would be a problem for his team in the NFC
Championship. The game will be played at the Trans World Dome, home
of the St. Louis Rams and one of the loudest places in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Before Dungy could answer, a plane flew over the Tampa Bay
practice facilities, which are located less than a mile from Tampa
International Airport. After pausing a few seconds to allow the
noise to diminish, Dungy grinned and said, ``That is why we
practice here.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his players and coaches are accustomed to the din,
Dungy remains concerned about the St. Louis crowd on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Noise is going to be a factor _ no doubt about it,'' he said.
``We could tell that by watching the TV (on Sunday). The crowd was
all hyped up and it will be loud in there again this weekend. The
best thing we can do is play well and hold down the score.''
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy football
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers' workouts Monday were extremely light Monday.
There was a short 30-minute walk-through, and the only players to
break a sweat all day were punter Mark Royals and kicker Martin
Gramatica, who both lifted light weights before the team took the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Several players didn't even suit up in complete practice
uniforms. Seven players were injured in Saturday's ultra-physical
contest against the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of guys that were banged up today,'' Dungy said.
``We anticipate everybody other than Al Singleton (broken ankle)
and Reidel Anthony (strained quadraceps muscles) to probably be
practicing on Wednesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Dungy has rewarded the players with a day off today, while the
coaches will report to work to study film and devise the game plan.
The staff will also have to make personnel decisions, such as
deciding whether or not to put Singleton on injured reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't decided that yet,'' Dungy said. ``(Singleton) told
me he will be ready to play next week (if we make it to the Super
Bowl Jan. 30), even though he has a broken leg. We're going to wait
and see. We may put him on the (injured reserve), but we really
don't need to. We've still got a couple of spots (on the 53-man
roster) available.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony is the third-leading receiver on the team, while
Singleton is a standout on special teams and a reserve linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   No security worries
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Falcons guarded NFC Championship practices last year
like a presidential visit. Tampa Bay has almost the opposite
approach to security, with most of it due to location. A tall
business building and four-level parking garage overlook the west
side of the team's practice field. Reporters walked through the
gates on the field without press credentials being checked.
</P>
<P>
   So does Dungy think St. Louis spies are all about?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Dungy said. ``I know Coach (Dick) Vermeil real well and
he does not cheat. So I don't have to worry about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing like old friends
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Vikings coach Dennis Green and Dungy are close
friends. Green employed Dungy as Minnesota's defensive coordinator
from 1992-95. On Monday, Dungy called some of his old buddies on
the Vikings staff to ask for any tips or advice against the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to people there, and we got some things that
hopefully we can use,'' Dungy said. ``But we are going to have to
figure out how to beat St. Louis on our own. Not many people have
done that on their own. We'll see if we can.''

   Q. Is there a specific time each year when the villas designed
by Palladio in the Veneto are open to visitors? And do you need to
travel in a group to see them? _ Louise Wartik, State College, Pa. &QL;

<P>
   A. It depends on the villa. There are 18 surviving Palladian
villas in the area around Venice, and many welcome visitors.
Admission fees range from about $4.25 to $6.50, at 1,875 lire to
$1. Here is a sampling of the villas that are open to visitors,
with their dates and hours: &QL;

   The Villa Barbaro, in the village of Maser next to Asolo, was
built between 1549 and 1558; the chapel was built in 1579-80. The
central residence features 16th-century frescoes, principally by
Veronese. It is 35 miles from Venice and is open Tuesday, Saturday
and Sunday from 3 to 6 p.m. March to September and 2:30 to 5 p.m.
October to February. The chapel is open Tuesday upon request; call
(39-0423) 923-004. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Villa Cornaro, in the village of Piombino Dese about 20
miles from Venice, was built in 1552 to 1553. The two-story
projecting portico-loggia was a motif that influenced Western
architecture for centuries, turning up in Georgian and Colonial
American architecture. It was said to be the first model Jefferson
used for Monticello. The villa is a short walk from the Piombino
Dese train station. It is open May to September on Saturday 3:30 to
6 p.m. Call (39-049) 936-5017. &QL; 
   The Villa Emo, in Fanzolo di Vedelago (about 30 miles by car
from Venice), was built in 1559-65. The central residence has four
columns, and symmetrical wings of farm buildings extend from each
side, with dovecotes at the ends. The Capitol building in
Washington can trace its architectural roots to the villa. It is
open May through September, on Monday, Wednesday and Friday 2:30 to
6 p.m., Tuesday 3 to 6 p.m., Saturday 2:30 to 7 p.m. and Sunday 10
a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 2:30 to 7 p.m. Call (39-0423) 476-414. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Villa Foscari, in Malcontenta di Mira on the banks of the
Brenta River, is near the Venice coastal lagoon. Completed around
1560, it has a sad-looking woman in one of its frescoes, which may
have been the source of its commonly used name: La Malcontenta. It
is open Tuesday and Saturday 9 a.m. to noon and by appointment;
call (39-041) 547-0012. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Villa Almerico, in Vicenza, was completed after Palladio's
death in 1580. The central dome, inspired by the Pantheon, gives
the villa its other name, La Rotonda. It is open March through
December. The villa and grounds are open Wednesday 10 a.m. to noon
and 3 to 6 p.m.; the grounds only are open the same hours all other
days except Monday; call (39-0444) 321-793.

   Q. Do Neapolitan-Americans in New York still celebrate the feast
day of San Gennaro? If so, when and where? _ Peter Barna, Hollywood
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. St. Januarius, who was the bishop of Benevento in southern
Italy during the Emperor Diocletian's persecutions, was martyred in
Naples in 305. He is considered the patron saint of Naples, where
his remains are enshrined and where he is known as San Gennaro.
</P>
<P>
   Many New Yorkers, though, probably think he is the patron saint
of sausage-and-pepper heroes _ along with zeppole and cannoli and
all the other delights sold each September on the streets of Little
Italy during the Festival of San Gennaro. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 74th festival will be Sept. 14 to 24, with most of the
attractions _ outdoor food stalls, music and games of chance _ on
Mulberry Street between Canal and Houston in Lower Manhattan. Hours
are usually 11:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. on weekdays and until midnight
on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Highlights of the festival include the two appearances of the
statue of San Gennaro, which is carried along Mulberry by a half
dozen men. The first appearance will be in the afternoon on Sept.
16, as part of a parade with floats. The second will be in the
evening on Sept. 19, the feast day, and will simply be the carrying
of the statue. Members of the San Gennaro Society will accept
donations as the statue is carried past.
</P>
<P>
   Musical performances ranging from rock to Italian folk music
will take place in the evenings on weekends and many weeknights.

A MAKEOVER IN ANAHEIM, FOR PARKS AND CITY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ There is no missing the big changes afoot in
Anaheim. For months, no motorist on Interstate 5, the overcrowded
freeway that snakes through this aging tourist town, could fail to
notice the outline of new ramps and overpasses and seemingly
endless construction that herald the biggest development effort
here in the 45 years since Walt Disney first built his Magic
Kingdom. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half a century after it opened in a sleepy sea of orange
groves, Disneyland is as fresh and spotless as ever, and it remains
the single most popular tourist attraction in Southern California,
drawing some 13.7 million visitors in 1998, according to Amusement
Business, a trade journal.
</P>
<P>
   But the urban corridor of strip malls, fast-food outlets and
motels that has grown up around it was tired and long overdue for a
lift. It is getting one in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two years, Anaheim will see the fruits of a $4.2
billion public-private redevelopment in the works since 1996. It
will bring a whole new theme park called Disney's California
Adventure, plus a retail shopping complex, an expanded convention
center, and new hotels, roads and landscaping to 1,100 acres
surrounding the original park.
</P>
<P>
   Just 12 miles away in Buena Park, Knott's Berry Farm, Orange
County's second-most-popular attraction, with some 3.4 million
visitors, will open its Perilous Plunge this summer. That ride,
featuring a four-and-a-half-story chute down which boats will
plunge at a 75-degree angle, is billed as the longest, steepest
water ride in the world and is just one part of an overall upgrade
at Knott's that will also feature a separate new 13-acre water park
called Soak City, U.S.A., scheduled to open on Memorial Day with 21
water rides and attractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a different world every day now,'' said Elaine
Cali, the communications director for the Anaheim/Orange County
Visitor and Convention Bureau, whose office overlooks the changing
construction scene.
</P>
<P>
   Disney alone is investing $1.4 billion to expand its original
resort and build the new California-theme park _ celebrating beach
culture, the redwood forests and other features of the state _ on
the site of its former parking lot. It is bridging the two with
Downtown Disney, a 300,000-square-foot retail, dining and
entertainment complex, like the one at Walt Disney World in
Orlando, that will feature outlets of popular spots like House of
Blues and the La Brea Bakery, the Los Angeles-based emporium of
irresistible breads and pastries.
</P>
<P>
   These expanded attractions, including a 750-room luxury hotel,
the Grand Californian, built in the style of Frank Lloyd Wright,
are to open early in 2001. A 10,000-car enclosed parking garage is
going up adjacent to the parks, and the original Disneyland Hotel
is being remodeled. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By December 2000, a $177 million expansion of the Anaheim
Convention Center, across the street from the park, is scheduled to
be finished, increasing total square footage by 40 percent, to 1.6
million square feet. A major redesign of the former Anaheim
Stadium, now known as Edison Field International and home of the
Disney-owned Anaheim Angels baseball team, has already been
completed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The town has not seen anything of this magnitude, certainly
since the original Disneyland was built,'' said Ms. Cali of the
convention bureau. ``This was truly an agricultural community then,
but today it's an urban destination and very built up, so to be
able to change the landscape is pretty remarkable.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Together, the new Disney-related attractions are expected to
increase the average stay in the resort corridor to four nights,
from three now, though some developers have held off building new
hotels until they are sure more visitors will come, leading to some
predictions of a shortage of rooms in the near term.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, when the California economy was in a deep
recession and the greater Los Angeles area was rocked by riot, fire
and earthquake, attendance at Disneyland and other parks fell
sharply. Although it has since bounced back, some hotel analysts
say lenders remain put off by Anaheim's low average room rate,
about $76, compared with an overall nationwide average of $81
through November, according to Smith Travel Research. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All the construction has been a challenge for local hotels,
which have struggled to fill rooms in the face of the congestion.
While the California Division of Tourism has projected an overall
increase of about 6 percent in travel within and to California in
1999, Orange County was expected to end the year with about 38.05
million visitors, up just 0.8 percent from 1998. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, perhaps the most visible sign of the efforts in
Anaheim is the freeway construction, a $1.1 billion makeover aimed
at nearly doubling the lanes of a 9.5-mile section that has been
among the most congested in the region. Construction has had to
allow for the continuing crowds at Disneyland and has required
rerouting up to 36,000 vehicles a day. It is scheduled to be
finished late in 2000, just in time for the opening of the new
Disney park. &QL;

BUSH CAMP SAYS MEDIA PARTIAL TO MCCAIN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and top aides
are doing a slow burn at what they _ as well as some unaligned
observers of the race for the Republican presidential nomination _
see as the news media's favorable treatment of Sen. John McCain of
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   While hesitant to make their discontent a front-burner issue in
the increasingly testy Bush-McCain face-off, it doesn't take a
jackhammer to unearth the Bush camp's resentment.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's side is bemused and blames any problem on what it sees
as a result of the naturally gregarious governor being kept from
the news media and ``overhandled'' by aides, while McCain is
perpetually available for interviews and schmoozing.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush high command sees a media determination to attempt
to create a close Republican race and says reporters are reacting
unprofessionally to McCain's constant courting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the front-runner, and he's not held to the same
standard of scrutiny the front-runner is,'' Karen Hughes, Bush's
spokeswoman, said of McCain. ``I understand the media is human. The
media likes an underdog. ... But I do think, if you look at the
standards of scrutiny, they're a little different.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, a former TV reporter, insisted that she does not like
``to blame the media for things,'' but that was the clear thrust of
her remarks.
</P>
<P>
   When asked for specifics, Hughes cited examples of the news
media's handling of what she sees as both superficial (pop quizzes
for both candidates) and substantive (economic plans from both
campaigns) elements of the race.
</P>
<P>
   When McCain was asked in December to name the prime minister of
Ireland and the governor of Vermont, he came up with neither
without some prompting.
</P>
<P>
   ``One newspaper wrote about it,'' Hughes said of a brief article
in the New York Times. ``No other newspaper in America mentioned
it.'' When Bush earlier was asked to name the leaders of four
hot-spot nations, he at least got one right, she said, but ``every
newspaper, every broadcast outlet, every radio in America reported
it'' as a major shortcoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I think it implies a little bit of a double standard,''
Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that McCain has gotten an easy ride from reporters
on his economic proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think that Governor Bush could have released a tax plan
and said he was going to pay for it with unspecified cuts in pork
barrel (projects)?'' Hughes said. ``I mean, the press would have
been all over him to identify them. ... That's an example in which
we feel we've been very conscientious in developing our policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush seemed tempted to let loose when asked about the media's
perceived tilt to McCain, but checked his impulse and, with a fixed
smile, offered a bit of mock high-mindedness: ``I'm confident the
esteemed members of the press corps will treat all of us fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   Academics see the media's treatment of McCain as classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emerging challenger story is just irresistible,'' said
Linda Fowler, government professor at Dartmouth College in Hanover,
N.H., pointing to political science studies of the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The national news media has been, until recently, much more
critical of Bush,'' Fowler said. ``The minute that somebody attains
front-runner status, the press begins to examine them more
closely.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Schnur, the McCain campaign's director of communications,
said his candidate's success with the news media ``isn't rocket
science. A candidate or officer-holder who makes himself available
to reporters is more likely to be covered'' favorably. ``It's not
much more complicated than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Schnur said Bush's aides have kept him inaccessible to the media
and that it has been a disservice to the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know George W. Bush is a great guy. I worked with him on his
father's campaign,'' Schnur said. ``A reporter traveling with him
may never get the opportunity to come to the same conclusion. ...
There are some candidates who you want to keep locked away, no
matter what, but that's not Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   And it certainly hasn't been McCain, who has a virtually nonstop
political tutorial with reporters aboard his not immodestly named
campaign bus, the ``Straight Talk Express.''
</P>
<P>
   Schnur said the almost constant access has paid off, and the
candidates' pop-quiz experience was ``a perfect example.''
</P>
<P>
   When McCain faced the questions about leaders of Ireland and
Vermont, ``he had just finished holding forth for 45 minutes on
foreign policy, history and public affairs,'' Schnur said. ``So by
the time of that particular question, reporters understood it was
an atypical lapse instead of an indication of some broader
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a guess,'' Schnur said, but if Bush had just spent
that much time talking with reporters about his relationship with
the president of Mexico, that TV interview (in which the pop quiz
occurred) wouldn't have gotten so much more attention than it
deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they'd let (Bush) sit in the back of the bus with the press
corps, I can't even imagine the kind of an impact it would have.''
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL END
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Hughes said that, as a result of the claims
of Bush's inaccessibility to reporters, she had begun keeping a
list of the governor's media contacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get sort of frustrated with all this `He's not answering the
questions,''' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   In a couple of days, she said, she had noted 18 one-on-one
interviews with reporters and two ``press availabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of a major reporter who's asked to talk to the
governor who hasn't been able to,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes does not blame reporters who have covered Bush on an
ongoing basis, but she recalled a national reporter who had not
been out with the governor much and then on a Sunday interview show
talked about Bush avoiding reporters. Next day, Hughes said, the
reporter called seeking an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to say, `you just said he's not accessible to the
media, so why bother to ask,''' Hughes said.

ONE WHO GOT AWAY RETURNS TO NEW JERSEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first time Kevin Bannon saw Troy Murphy, Murphy was just a
gangly freshman center at Delbarton High School in Morristown, N.J.
A bit awkward and unpolished, Murphy seemed like a player that
Bannon, who was then coaching at Rider College, might be able to
land.
</P>
<P>
   But as Bannon watched him play continually over the next few
years, he noticed that Murphy was not quite what he appeared to be
at first glance. The 6-foot-9-inch frame hid an athleticism that
would bring him far out of Rider's reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 10 times quicker than you think,'' Bannon said. ``He's
way more athletic than he looks. He's just got an incredible feel
for the game. It's effortless. It looks like he's going through the
motions, and then at the end of the game he's got 35 points and 15
rebounds. He looks like a guy who should be playing in a men's
league. He looks like he's not a sculpted athlete, but he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Bannon moved on from Rider to Rutgers at the time that Murphy
was entering his senior year of high school. Bannon hoped that the
early contact and attention would persuade Murphy to take a chance
on a team that won just 11 games the season before and had
dismissed its head coach. But the allure of Notre Dame and the
chance to follow a player he idolized, Pat Garrity, proved too
strong. When it came down to the decision between the schools,
Murphy left his home state in favor of the Golden Dome.
</P>
<P>
   He will return Tuesday night, to Piscataway, meeting Rutgers for
the first time after missing last year's game because of a sprained
ankle. It is one of two Big East games in New Jersey on Tuesday
night, with 12-2 St. John's, fresh off its upset of Connecticut,
taking on 11-3 Seton Hall at Continental Arena in East Rutherford.
</P>
<P>
   While St. John's-Seton Hall may be the marquee game, Murphy may
be the Big East's marquee player. He filled out to 240 pounds and
won Big East honors as rookie of the year last season, shattering
Adrian Dantley's school record for freshman scoring and becoming
the first rookie to lead the conference in rebounding. This season,
he has been named the Big East player of the week five times,
including the last four weeks in a row, and has led the Fighting
Irish to an 11-6 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rutgers is a school I really liked in the recruiting process,
and I felt really comfortable with Kevin and his staff,'' Murphy
said. ``I remember I was the first one he went on a home visit with
as the new coach there. It was a hard decision. A lot of people
were saying the only way you can be a good player is if you stay
home. I just went with my heart. But I check on Rutgers in the
paper to see how they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bannon said: ``When we were able to talk, we hit it off really
well. I thought that Troy and I had a lot in common. I knew he was
hungry to be great and I was hungry to build this program. We were
close to doing those two things together. But the pull of Notre
Dame, I think, was coming from people around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he in his heart he would have liked to come here. We
brought in Dahntay Jones, Rashod Kent and Eugene Dabney that year.
I've been looking at film of him this week and thinking that that
would have been a great first recruiting class.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Murphy was the main ingredient that Matt Doherty
inherited this season when he became head coach at Notre Dame.
Little has changed in Murphy's production with the coaching change
as he ranks second in Division I in scoring behind Sirvaliant Brown
of George Washington, averaging 24.9 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   On this trip home, Murphy said that he would not do any
visiting, trying to focus on the game and nothing else. But he
still relishes talking about his New Jersey roots. In the Notre
Dame media guide, each player's biography is accompanied by a
questionnaire. The final question asks each player for his picks
for this year's Final Four. Murphy listed three New Jersey
community colleges, along with Indiana University-South Bend.
``It's a salute to New Jersey,'' he said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy is as loose as a player can be on the floor, an attribute
he believes helps him overcome the constant attention he gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not flaky,'' he said. ``I just mess around and try to have
a good time. I try to stay loose. It relaxes me, and I play better
when I'm loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Bannon said that he sees an amazing leap in Murphy's abilities
since those first few times he saw him. ``He wasn't anywhere near
the finished product back then,'' Bannon said. ``His game exploded,
and it's all hard work. What separates him from other kids is that
a lot of kids talk about wanting to be great. He doesn't talk about
it; he does it.'' &QL;

   Dr. Robert R. Wilson, a physicist who built the world's most
powerful particle smashers in a setting that he insisted be
surrounded by restored prairies and enriched by striking
architecture and objects of art, died on Sunday at his home in
Ithaca, N.Y. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   With a career that began in the 1930s, Wilson became one of the
most important figures in the history of the development of
particle accelerators, which smash subatomic particles together at
high energy for the study of their interactions and composition.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was involved in numerous breakthroughs in physics
research and accelerator design, perhaps his crowning achievement
came when he led the design and construction of the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory in what was then farmland west of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Fermilab, as it is known, began operating in 1972 as the most
powerful accelerator in the world. And because of the futuristic
technologies then embraced by Wilson, the laboratory has been able
to increase its energy over the years and is expected to remain the
world's most powerful until 2006, when it will be superseded by the
Large Hadron Collider, an accelerator under construction at the
CERN laboratory in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his scientific achievements, Wilson was known for the
environment he created at the Fermilab site, with hundreds of acres
of restored prairie, a herd of bison, fishing holes, abstract
sculpture and a central building modeled, in spirit at least, on
the Beauvais Cathedral in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he created Fermilab, it certainly had a style,'' said Dr.
Leon Lederman, the Nobel Prize-winning particle physicist who
succeeded Wilson as director of the laboratory. ``He was a showman
in that sense; he took chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Wilson had had ``an
unerring sense of what is important to the science of high-energy
physics and its importance to the nation.``
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rathbun Wilson was born on March 4, 1914, in Frontier,
Wyo. Though he tinkered with pumps and vacuum tubes as a boy, he
apparently took plenty of time to enjoy the outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always had big, wild tales about being a cowboy in
Wyoming,'' said Dr. Dale Corson, a particle physicist and former
president of Cornell University, who had known Wilson since the
1930s. ``Most of them turned out to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson received a bachelor's degree from the University of
California at Berkeley in 1936 and remained there for graduate
school. His scientific style became clear early, said Corson, who
was a student there at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Corson said Ernest Lawrence, the legendary inventor of the
particle accelerator called the cyclotron, assigned a problem in a
Berkeley physics course that no student but Robert Wilson managed
to solve. The problem involved finding the strength of the electric
fields inside the cyclotron.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the students tried to perform difficult
calculations to find the fields, Wilson quickly built a simplified
model of a cyclotron in a physics laboratory and measured the
electric fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was his hallmark: a completely ingenious way of solving
the problem,'' Corson said. ``And that carried right up to the
Fermilab machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson went on to do research on the cyclotron with Lawrence
before joining the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb. He
had stints at Los Alamos National Laboratory and Harvard before
becoming the director of the Laboratory of Nuclear Studies at
Cornell in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   While at Cornell, he did experiments on the structure of protons
that were later explained by the theory that they are constituted
of smaller particles called quarks, Lederman said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Wilson took a leave of absence from Cornell to become
the founding director of Fermilab, where he left his mark as a
brilliant designer of the powerful magnets necessary to confine the
fast particles as they whirled around a giant ring.
</P>
<P>
   He created the natural, architectural and artistic amenities in
part to attract good scientists to the Illinois cornfields and in
part because of an innate sense of aesthetics, said Dr. Boyce
McDaniel, a longtime friend who is a retired Cornell physicist.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's design of the tunnel through which the particles raced
at Fermilab included plenty of space to allow for technical
improvements. That space came in handy when superconducting
magnets, a powerful innovation that Wilson pushed to develop, were
later installed, allowing the lab to boost its energy.
</P>
<P>
   His dislike of bureaucracy was legendary and fit with his
sometimes contrarian nature, said Dr. Michael Witherell, Fermilab's
current director, who has a handwritten note from Wilson that reads
in part: ``An all too common failing of large institutions is to
fall into the bureaucratic morass _ complicated procedures, red
tape and all that. That's terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is survived by his wife, Jane; three sons, Daniel of
Indianapolis, Jonathan of Columbus, Ind., and Rand of Boston; a
sister, Mary Jane Greenhill of Palos Verdes Estates, Calif.; and
four grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was known for completing huge projects ahead of schedule
and below budget, but he resigned as director of Fermilab in 1978
because he did not believe that the government was financing it
generously enough. He also once lectured a joint committee of
Congress on why basic science was crucial even when it did not lead
to instant practical benefits.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearings, in 1969, Wilson's feistiness was most on
display in an exchange with Sen. John Pastore of Rhode Island. When
Pastore pressed Wilson on whether the knowledge gained at Fermilab
would enhance national defense, Wilson said, ``It has nothing to do
with defending our country, except to make it worth defending.''

DEVRY INSTITUTE OPENS NEW CAMPUS
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES -- With an eye toward providing the region's
growing technology industry with a stream of skilled workers, DeVry
Institute officially opens its doors Tuesday in the West Hills
section of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The school, one of four DeVry campuses in California, has been
conducting classes since November.
</P>
<P>
   But today DeVry will celebrate its grand opening.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 students are enrolled at the campus, said Rose Marie
Dishman, president of Devry's Southern California campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Dishman said she plans an outreach program to attract students _
particularly women _ who are underrepresented in technology jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up, there weren't very many women and then
Sputnik came along and women got interested in technology,'' Dish
Still, the technology industry is one that has lacked an equal
representation of women, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like the computer industry has become a man's
world,'' she said. ``We are trying to get into the grade schools to
stimulate interest.
</P>
<P>
   While DeVry is primarily a technology-oriented school, it offers
other programs as well, including accounting, Dishman said. DeVry
tends to draw its students from a 30-mile radius, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the (technology) industry that's developing in the San
Fernando Valley, we're really in the right place at the right
time,'' Dishman said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to hands-on training using the computers and
applications employed in the industry, DeVry tailors its programs
to meet the needs of specific companies, Dishman said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the senior projects required of graduates are designed
by local technology companies to fit within the requirements estab
``We try to go and find a company that's willing to spend their
time to design a project that a student can do in 15 weeks,'' she
really where you can focus the program on what the industry is.''

ROMAN HOLIDAY? SAMPLE TOURS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Taking a trip to Rome during the Catholic Church's Jubilee Year
might seem intimidating, particularly to travelers who have never
been to Italy. But even for those not religiously motivated, this
year provides a good opportunity to see the city spruced up, with
many public facilities renovated and transit systems attuned to
tourists. The exchange rate is also advantageous, with the lira at
nearly 1,900 to $1. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The easy way to do it is with a tour or package, because many
causes for anxiety, like getting to the hotel from the airport, are
dealt with by someone else, and old hands are ready to offer help. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Regular tour operators are not using the Jubilee Year as a
selling device, and thus have shunned the big price jumps that
upset many consumers about millennium tours and events. Travelers
to Rome are still able to look at the choices and seek out the
religious component, or bypass it, in selecting a tour. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't focus on the Jubilee as an event,'' said Robert
Saccone, director of United States development for Italiatour, a
division of Alitalia. ``Our job is to promote travel by people of
all religions.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perillo Tours of Woodcliff Lake, N.J., has this to say in its
catalog for spring and summer: ``Scrub, scrub, scrub. It seems that
half of Rome's buildings have shed centuries of grime to happily
reveal their original beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Perillo, the president, said that his company does not
emphasize events like papal audiences, although of course tour
officials advise group members of each day's events. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Operators consulted early this month said that they had space on
Rome tours scheduled through the end of the year. That includes
TourCrafters of Libertyville, Ill., one of two United States
operators designated by the Vatican Central Committee as official
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The second, the Catholic Travel Center of Burbank, Calif., which
designs tours for clubs and churches, said that it had instituted
early deadlines and that most of its group capacity for spring and
summer was booked, although there were spaces for independent
travelers. J. Scott Scherer, the president, said that bookings
would be 65 percent above last year _ he anticipates 3,000 to 4,000
clients. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perillo, whose company calls itself the world's largest operator
of tours to Italy _ with clients numbering ``tens of thousands
yearly'' _ said he was sure that spring and summer would fill up
but that at the moment there is space. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prices on Rome tours take a step up in March, when the weather
eases and average sunshine increases to six hours a day from the
January-February level of four. Lent begins March 8 and Easter is
April 23, and high-season prices are fully in effect by then. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until then, what would normally be viewed as short-stay winter
packages are available. Almost all use Alitalia, but some flights
are on British Airways and Sabena. Trans World Airlines dropped its
New York-Rome route on Jan. 10, although it still serves Milan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a sampling of tours headed for Rome this year: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until March 10, TourCrafters' economy trip of five nights costs
$599 in double occupancy, with air fare from New York, Boston,
Miami or Chicago. It uses the Brasile, a three-star hotel, and
includes breakfast, hotel service charges and taxes. Transfers are
not included; neither are airport taxes and other miscellany,
totaling about $75 a person. There may be a $25 extra charge for a
departure on Friday, Saturday or Sunday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CIT Tours Corp. in New York also has a five-night Rome winter
special at $599 a person, with two in a room, through March 10. It
includes round-trip nonstop Alitalia air fare from New York,
Boston, Chicago or Miami, rail transportation to and from the
airport, and five nights at the three-star Donatello Hotel on the
Via di Porta Maggiore near the train station, with buffet
breakfasts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   British Airways through London is also offered, for $70
additional. Departure is available any day of the week. Airport
taxes are not included.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Italiatour offers Roman Jubilee, a four-night trip. Until March
12, including air fare from New York and Boston, and using the
three-star hotels Augustea, Center and Portamaggiore, it costs
$689; for the rest of March, it is $769. Three days of tours,
including the Christian Rome Tour, are offered. Continental
breakfasts, transfers between airport and hotel, and hotel service
charges and taxes are included.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perillo's prices are higher than those given above because the
company quotes the same cost for many different departure cities,
some as far from the Atlantic as Seattle and San Francisco. The
company also uses first-class hotels. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Through Feb. 26, Perillo's six-night packages begin at $1,199
for each of two people in a room in a four-star hotel. The tours
leave on Saturday and Thursday, returning the next Saturday or
Thursday. The price includes round-trip air fare, transfers from
the Rome airport and back, buffet breakfasts, hotel service
charges, taxes and tips.
</P>
<P>
   A half-day of sightseeing is scheduled, and Perillo provides a
host at the hotel at particular hours to give directions and help
with activities. A single room costs $329 more. In March, the tour
price goes to $1,299.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On April 17 the Perillo schedule shifts to Monday-Monday, and
the price rises to $1,799; from June 19 into October, it is $1,999.
The hotel for the high season is the new Hotel Empire Palace on the
Via Aureliana. Perillo is unusual in not accepting credit cards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A six-night package designed for the Jubilee Year by
TourCrafters is called ``Rome, Home of the Holy Father.'' It is
available until March 31 for $1,099 a person from New York or
Boston, with two in a room. The price increases thereafter. This
tour includes a Pilgrim's Card allowing entry on Rome's transit
system for three days, medical assistance and telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   The tour is open to groups _ which depart on the day of their
choice and get price discounts at certain levels of participation _
and to independent travelers, who also may depart any day. The
hotel at the basic price is the three-star Centro, on Via Firenze,
or a similar place. Breakfasts and dinners are included, also
transfers from the airport, hotel service and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Two sightseeing expeditions are included, as well as attendance
at a papal audience on a Wednesday, a papal blessing on a Sunday
and a Jubilee event. Airport taxes are not included.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All these tours can be booked through travel agents. Here are
addresses and numbers for the operators mentioned. &QL;

 &HT;    Atlantans turn out to honor martyr
 &HT;    By Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Whether they were trained, ordained or just inspired,
it seemed that everyone who took the pulpit at Atlanta's Ebenezer
Baptist Church on Monday became a preacher, extolling the virtues
and vision, the legend and legacy of the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr., as part of the 15th annual King Day Celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to do something about all these unlicensed
preachers up here,'' quipped Rev. Joseph Roberts, who has been
pastor of Ebenezer more than 20 years. Following greetings from
U.S. Sen. Paul Coverdell, U.S. Rep. John Lewis, Gov. Roy Barnes and
Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell, Roberts said people have to move from
talking to walking and have to learn, as King urged, to judge each
other not by the color of their skin but by the content of their
character.
</P>
<P>
   The audience in the historic sanctuary _ and in nearby Freedom
Hall and in an auditorium of the new Ebenezer, from which the
commemorative 10 a.m. service was broadcast _ responded to the
speakers with shouts of ``amen,'' applause and standing ovations.
Among those cheering was Naphtalie Hatcher, a 20-year-old Georgia
Tech student from Augusta, who got up hours before normal and
waited in line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two years, I've slept in, but this time I was
determined to come,'' said Hatcher, who planned to spend the
afternoon studying engineering. ``I wanted to learn more about Dr.
King, and I've learned a lot from the speakers, that a lack of
education holds everyone back, and with knowledge comes the
opportunity to serve. I'm really glad I came.''
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic Bishop Eddie Long of fast-growing New Birth
Missionary Baptist Church in Decatur brought the audience to its
feet with a tribute that said King knew the difference between
purpose and destiny _ in fulfilling his destiny, he transcended
time and moved into eternity. Long urged his listeners to not
celebrate yesterday but move into tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The keynote speaker was Rev. DeForest ``Buster'' Soaries Jr.,
pastor of the First Baptist Church of Lincoln Gardens, N.J., and
the New Jersey secretary of state. He likened King to David
battling the Goliath of discrimination, adding that there are
Goliath's children to fight. These modern-day Goliaths, he said,
fly Confederate battle flags over the South Carolina state Capitol,
drag black men to their deaths in Jasper, Texas, and come in all
shapes, colors, guises and economic packaging.
</P>
<P>
   Loving King today is easy, but that hasn't always been the case,
Soaries said _ people hear only the part of his message they want
to hear. ``We love Dr. King when he says, 'I have a dream'; we hate
Dr. King and his family when he says, 'I have a copyright,''' said
Soaries. Some people have criticized the King family for agreeing
to sell the papers of Martin Luther King Jr. to the Library of
Congress for $20 million. Hearings on the sale will be held when
Congress reconvenes.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on the curb near a t-shirt vendor were Tina and Kevin
Underwood, of Jonesboro, Ga., and their two sons, Martin and Aaron.
They think so much of Martin Luther King, Jr., that they named
their older son in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Underwood, who teaches math at Jonesboro High, said she's
feeling a call to get more involved in community affairs, maybe by
working with young people. She said King Day ``is a time to
celebrate our differences. We can have a dialogue and learn to
celebrate all people.''
</P>
<P>
   As the marchers made their way along Auburn Avenue, Thomasville
native, Mack Clark, 32, watched various union groups, cheerleaders,
parent groups, Boy Scouts, step groups, Greek organizations, and
dance and drum troupes pass by, all races, all ages, sizes and
nationalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look back on what Dr. King did and realize he was
out for everybody,'' said Clark, who has lived in Decatur for seven
years. ``It feels good to see people sticking together. That's what
he would have wanted.''

CUBAN DAD CAN'T MATCH UNCLE SAM

<TEXT>
<P>
   Them communists in Cuba still don't get it so I figure we have
no choice but to send in the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   That's about the only way we'll convince every cussed madre and
padre on the island to hand over their children so we can ship 'em
north to be raised properly in the land of the free and the home of
the Atlanta Braves. Or, in the case of young Elian Gonzalez, the
Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the Marxist muchachos seem to believe a boy is better
off living in the home of his father rather than here, the Home of
the Whopper.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, some bureaucrats in the U.S. government agree
with the reds. They want to ship the 6-year-old back, talking
nonsense about how Elian's father loves him and wants him home.
</P>
<P>
   That's why you and I and every other real live nephew of our
Uncle Sam must let the Cubans know the only people capable of
raising a child are Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't tell 'em about Elizabeth Whittle.
</P>
<P>
   She's an American mother in Phoenix going to jail for 172{ years
for brutalizing her beautiful baby quintuplets. No need to bore the
Bolsheviks with little problems like that.
</P>
<P>
   All we need to do is tell 'em how much better it is for every
child in America than it is for every child in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   There's no reason to mention Patricia Moreno Oakes, the mother
from Phoenix who turned her 6-year-old daughter into a prostitute
to feed her drug habit.
</P>
<P>
   Also, please, don't bring up the unfortunate story of
6-month-old Denzel Garland, a Phoenix boy who was left in the care
of a teenage cousin only to wind up dead in a dumpster with his
throat slashed.
</P>
<P>
   Those examples are from just one city. Imagine how confusing it
will be if reports from other towns start leaking out? Instead,
simply remind the honchos in Havana about our shopping malls and
video games and Peter Piper Pizzas.
</P>
<P>
   We're under no obligation to tell them about the National Center
for Injury and Prevention Council report showing how unintentional
and intentional firearm injuries are the leading causes of death
for American youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   And we shouldn't cloud the issue with the Hudson Institute study
showing that, among long-term prison inmates, 70 percent grew up
without fathers, including 60 percent of the rapists and 75 percent
of adolescents charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Or that fatherless children are three times more likely to fail
in school or commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Or that kids living without their dads are 40 times more likely
to suffer child abuse.
</P>
<P>

``I have had some experience with communist governments, and there
are millions of Americans that have, too. Ask any of them who lived

boy to it.''

   Can you imagine anything worse than being condemned to live with
your dad?

<P>
   Still, I imagine the pinkos will try to twist things around by

point out that McCain called his dad and granddad the most
important influences in his life.

   Remember, they were AMERICAN men. Only U.S. fathers count.

CUBAN DAD CAN'T MATCH UNCLE SAM

<P>
   Them communists in Cuba still don't get it so I figure we have
no choice but to send in the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   That's about the only way we'll convince every cussed madre and
padre on the island to hand over their children so we can ship 'em
north to be raised properly in the land of the free and the home of
the Atlanta Braves. Or, in the case of young Elian Gonzalez, the
Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the Marxist muchachos seem to believe a boy is better
off living in the home of his father rather than here, the Home of
the Whopper.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, some bureaucrats in the U.S. government agree
with the reds. They want to ship the 6-year-old back, talking
nonsense about how Elian's father loves him and wants him home.
</P>
<P>
   That's why you and I and every other real live nephew of our
Uncle Sam must let the Cubans know the only people capable of
raising a child are Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't tell 'em about Elizabeth Whittle.
</P>
<P>
   She's an American mother in Phoenix going to jail for 172{ years
for brutalizing her beautiful baby quintuplets. No need to bore the
Bolsheviks with little problems like that.
</P>
<P>
   All we need to do is tell 'em how much better it is for every
child in America than it is for every child in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   There's no reason to mention Patricia Moreno Oakes, the mother
from Phoenix who turned her 6-year-old daughter into a prostitute
to feed her drug habit.
</P>
<P>
   Also, please, don't bring up the unfortunate story of
6-month-old Denzel Garland, a Phoenix boy who was left in the care
of a teenage cousin only to wind up dead in a dumpster with his
throat slashed.
</P>
<P>
   Those examples are from just one city. Imagine how confusing it
will be if reports from other towns start leaking out? Instead,
simply remind the honchos in Havana about our shopping malls and
video games and Peter Piper Pizzas.
</P>
<P>
   We're under no obligation to tell them about the National Center
for Injury and Prevention Council report showing how unintentional
and intentional firearm injuries are the leading causes of death
for American youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   And we shouldn't cloud the issue with the Hudson Institute study
showing that, among long-term prison inmates, 70 percent grew up
without fathers, including 60 percent of the rapists and 75 percent
of adolescents charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Or that fatherless children are three times more likely to fail
in school or commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Or that kids living without their dads are 40 times more likely
to suffer child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   We should listen instead to Sen. John McCain, who said of Elian,
``I have had some experience with communist governments, and there
are millions of Americans that have, too. Ask any of them who lived
under it what it was like and whether we should condemn that young

BRADLEY AND GORE ENGAGE IN A SHARP EXCHANGE ON RACIAL PROFILING
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Hoping to stir doubts about the
administration's commitment to minorities, former Sen. Bill Bradley
on Monday night challenged Vice President Al Gore to press
President Clinton to issue an executive order banning racial
profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Gore fired back with a forceful defense of the president in a
brief but sharp confrontation between the two Democratic
presidential candidates as they appeared in their sixth _ and final
_ debate before the first votes are cast in the Iowa caucuses next
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley seized the offensive at a debate at a high school here
sponsored by the Iowa Brown-Black Presidential Forum, a group that
promotes black and Latino issues, after Gore pledged to sign an
executive order banning profiling, the practice of singling out
blacks for police questioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, Al, I know that you would issue an order to end
racial profiling if you were president of the United States,''
Bradley said. ``But we have a president now. You serve with him. I
want you to walk down that hallway, walk into his office, and say,
`Sign this executive order today.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore jumped to the president's defense, asserting, ``I don't
think President Bill Clinton needs a lecture from Bill Bradley
about how to stand up and fight for African-Americans and Latinos
in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice rising, Gore went on, ``It's one thing to talk the
talk. It's another thing to walk the walk, whether it's down the
hallway.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's comments elicited boos and jeers from the
audience of several hundred, which was stocked with supporters of
Bradley, who is lagging far behind Gore in the polls in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange over racial profiling made for the most tense
moments of the 60-minute televised forum. Most of the time, Bradley
and Gore put forth virtually identical positions. In fact, even
though minorities make up a tiny portion of the Iowa electorate,
they devoted themselves to trying to top one another in responding
to questions about who they would put on the Supreme Court, their
outrage at the Confederate flag that flies over the capitol of
South Carolina and their efforts to reach out to the Rev. Al
Sharpton, the New York civil rights leader.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, Gore reminded the audience that Monday was the
holiday honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. And invoking
King's memory, he pointed out that he had spoken Monday at the
Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta at the invitation of King's
widow, Coretta Scott King.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley sought to strike a chord with minorities by recalling
something he rarely discusses in public: his self-described role as
a conciliator between white and black players when he was a forward
for the New York Knicks. The subject came up when he was asked
about John Rocker, a pitcher for the Atlanta Braves who had made
disparaging remarks about blacks, immigrants and gays.
</P>
<P>
   He put it this way: ``When I was on the Knicks, one of my jobs
was when there was a white player that came on the team, who didn't
quite understand, used the wrong words, I took him over to the side
and said, `Look, that doesn't work on this team. If you want to be
on this team, you respect everybody.' If that had happened on the
Atlanta Braves, you wouldn't have had John Rocker.''
</P>
<P>
   In appealing to minorities, Bradley sought to close a gap in
what appears to be Gore's overwhelming edge in support from black
voters. Clinton is enormously popular with black voters, many of
whom are loyal to Gore because of his service in the Clinton White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Given Clinton's popularity among blacks, Bradley's scolding of
Clinton on Monday night was something of a risk. It was also
curious given that at forum honoring King at Drake University here
on Monday morning, Bradley praised the president's racial policies
in response to an audience question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're different people,'' he said of Clinton, ``but we have a
common commitment on race.''
</P>
<P>
   But among the broader electorate, Clinton is not as popular. By
invoking the Clinton-Gore connection, Bradley reminded voters of
what they may not like about the administration _ and implicitly
presented himself as a fresh face.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals Monday night were probably aimed as much at liberal
voters as at minorities. That is certainly the case here in Iowa,
which is 96.7 percent white and has among the lowest percentages of
minorities of any state. Blacks account for roughly 1.7 percent of
the population; Latinos make up 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley also reached out to minorities in response to a
question about the high percentage of blacks in prison. Both
candidates said they would consider reviewing the prohibition that
bars felons from voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principle that convicted felons do not have a right to
vote is an old one, it is well established,'' Gore said. ``I think
that the definition of what kind of crimes automatically fall in
the category that triggers that exclusion from the franchise could
well benefit from a fresh review.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley put it this way: ``If someone is on a nonviolent offense
and comes out and is able to go straight for two years, I think
that that person ought to be able to wipe his record clean and
start the day anew.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a marked contrast to Republican candidates who were reluctant
to attack South Carolina residents for hoisting a Confederate flag,
Gore and Bradley said it was a hurtful symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only the Republican candidates for president who are so
scared of the extreme right that they will be tolerant of
intolerance lest they offend the offensive,'' Gore declared. ``It
ought to come down.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said: ``I don't want this to be a symbol of America in
any way whatsoever. That's why it ought to come down.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For a few moments, the discourse veered from minority concerns
when Kimberly Defeo, a protester from Des Moines, interrupted the
forum by standing up and asking the candidates about their plans to
stop global warming. She was quickly hustled out of the auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, who wrote a best-selling book on global warming,
seized the opportunity to remind the audience of his background.
``I actually think they've got a good point,'' he said of the
environmental groups. ``Going about it the wrong way.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after the debate, the one-upmanship continued as both
contenders trotted out some of their best-known black and Hispanic
supporters to stand before reporters and tout their candidates'
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Gore brought along three minority cabinet members: Alexis
Herman, the labor secretary, and Rodney Slater, the transportation
secretary, who are both black, and Bill Richardson, the energy
secretary, who is Hispanic. During the debate, Gore also mentioned
two politicians from Bradley's home state of New Jersey who have
been sharply critical of Bradley: Mayor Sharpe James of Newark, who
is black, and Rep. Robert Menendez of Union City, who is of Cuban
descent.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, in turn, brought along Rep. Luis Guttierrez of Chicago
and state Rep. Maria Escutia from Los Angeles, both Hispanics. And
after the debate, Bradley also made an unannounced foray into the
press room with Bill Russell, the former Boston Celtic star, and
Cornell West, the Harvard professor who is his constant companion
at debates.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although the event Monday night marked the last time Gore and
Bradley will share a stage before the Iowa caucuses, both
contenders _ and their loyalists _ will be engaged in a frenzy of
stumping over the next six days. But it will be complicated by the
fact that the two are also spending time in New Hampshire, where
they are locked in a tighter race. The primary there is Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   With Gore well ahead in every poll of expected caucuses-goers,
the question among politicians in this state is not whether he will
win but by what margin. Polls show he is pulling more than 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the vice president still maintains his lead, Bill Bradley's
going to have a hard time breaking the 35 percent barrier,'' Rob
Tully, the chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party, said in an
interview. ``What the Bradley campaign has done over the last week
is to lower the expectations.''

IN POLICY SHIFT, GM WILL RELY ON ALLIANCES

   DETROIT _ In the first acknowledgment by the world's largest
corporation that it cannot go it alone, the chairman of General
Motors Corp. said Monday night that the company would rely more on
partnerships and would better be described as ``the General Motors
group.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our approach is to develop long-term relationships with other
companies that offer a unique advantage to the General Motors group
of brands and businesses,'' said John F. Smith Jr., chairman and
chief executive of GM, who was speaking at the Automotive News
World Congress here. ``This alliance strategy is our major thrust,
and it is clearly a different approach to growth than most people
have associated with General Motors _ or with the rest of the
industry, for that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The change in philosophy is remarkable for a company so large
that its spending seems to dwarf Third World economies, one so big
that a factory closing can attract more attention than the closing
of a U.S. military base, and one that can be as difficult to turn
as a battleship.
</P>
<P>
   ``No automaker today has the resources to achieve leadership in
all regions and all product segments on its own,'' Smith said, not
even GM, with its global presence and scores of household names _
from the Chevrolet Camaro to the Cadillac DeVille.
</P>
<P>
   GM has longstanding alliances with Isuzu Motors, Suzuki Motor
and Toyota Motor. But it has recently expanded some partnerships,
forged new ones and even formed three-way alliances. It is also
employing the alliance strategy with gusto when it comes to
Internet business initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, GM and Toyota formed a manufacturing partnership to
include research and development on fuel-cell and gas-electric
hybrid vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   About a month ago it formed an alliance with Fuji Heavy
Industries and its Subaru brand. GM benefits from Fuji's strength
in small sport utility vehicles, continuously variable
transmissions and all-wheel-drive systems, while Fuji can look
forward to sharing GM's vehicle platforms and other technologies.
</P>
<P>
   GM has also cut a deal with Honda Motor Co. in which Honda will
contribute six-cylinder engines and transmissions for a future
vehicle, and GM's previous partner, Isuzu, will send Honda diesel
engines for European sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are also discussing collaboration with Honda on other
technology and other business opportunities,'' Smith said. ``We
expect the value of the experience of working together, getting to
know each other at the individual level as well as companies, to
far outweigh the limited scope of this initial agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last week GM said it would buy the half of Saab Automobile
of Sweden that it did not already own. And it is now in talks to
buy some assets of Daewoo Motor of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not rule out acquisitions and mergers as opportunities
arise,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of alliances will play an important role in GM's
Internet strategies, Smith said. Last week alone, GM said it would
enter marketing partnerships with Sony, America Online and NetZero.
On Monday night Smith said GM was working on another alliance that
would give customers using GM's Onstar communications program a
single bill for that service and for wireless phone service.

EDITORIAL: CHINA ARRESTS A SCHOLAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Tuesday, Jan. 18: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a country where freedom of information is not respected,
possession of any kind of information can be prosecuted by the
government. China has demonstrated this by arresting Yongyi Song in
Beijing. After being detained for more than four months, Song, a
librarian at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa., and a scholar of
China's Cultural Revolution, was formally charged in December with
``the purchase and illegal provision of intelligence to
foreigners.'' According to Song's wife, Helen Yao, who was also
detained and has since been released, the ``intelligence'' that
Song was charged with possessing were documents that had already
been published, part of his effort to create a collection of
historical materials relating to the Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Song has permanent resident status in the United States and was
scheduled to become an American citizen in September. He is not
only a scholar of the Cultural Revolution but also one of its
victims, having been imprisoned for five years in the early 1970s
as a ``counterrevolutionary.'' China scholars in the United States
are rightly outraged by the case. As David Strand, Song's colleague
at Dickinson College, explains, an arrest of this kind threatens
the existence of the ``invisible university'' _ the community of
open research and intellectual discourse _ to which scholars around
the world belong.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the United States plans to introduce a resolution to
the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, noting China's
``crackdown on political dissent'' and tightening controls on the
media and the Internet. Song's arrest is consistent with that
crackdown. China clearly wishes to enforce a blindness to its own
history since 1949. Nothing could better illustrate its
determination to suppress that history, or be a better reminder of
Beijing's present intractability, than the arrest of a scholar
engaged in historical research.

CHINESE ARTISTS IN TIMES SQUARE DRAW CROWDS AND POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a recent chilly night in Times Square, Zhang Zhun
leaned over a blank canvas with his charcoal pencil. The
businessman sitting for him smiled nervously. Wisps of hair
appeared after a few strokes, then eyeglasses, then the bridge of a
nose.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving from China last year, Zhang, 46, joined a
community of a dozen or so Chinese portrait artists in the neon
glow of Times Square. Fixtures in the area, many set up shop every
evening in the shadow of the unfinished Reuters Building on Seventh
Avenue between 42nd and 43rd Streets, hanging celebrity portraits
on the plywood construction fence and hawking their skills to
passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the immigrants speak almost no English and worked as
artists or art teachers in China's largest cities. One said he had
emigrated to New York because of the art community, another for
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   But since construction began in earnest last year on the Reuters
Building, Zhang said, police officers have been trying to clear
them off the sidewalk almost every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come around and say, `No portrait, no portrait,''' he
said in Mandarin, shivering in a winter jacket. ``They don't like
what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, a police officer barreled through the crowd, in a
scene suggesting the frenzied strokes of a de Kooning. ``All of you
have to pack up and leave,'' Officer Robert Salmon yelled at the
artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the sketch artists are sketching these people,
they're doing something illegal,'' he told the tourists. ``They're
causing a crowd to gather.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidewalk artists are not required to have a vendor's license,
because the First Amendment protects freedom of expression. But
police officials said the artists' presence had forced pedestrians
into the street, jeopardizing lives. ``Once the construction
began,'' said Lt. Stephen Biegel, a police spokesman, ``tons of
tourists started roaming out into the flow of traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   Safety concerns for pedestrians, he said, supersede the First
Amendment rights of the artists.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lin Ming, 35, another portrait artist in the group, said that
even four years ago, the police would only occasionally force them
to leave the sidewalk. But last year, Lin said, the police visits
became more frequent. Sidewalk space, sometimes shared by Chinese
calligraphers, shrank when the plywood fence went up around the lot
last January.
</P>
<P>
   Some artists hang their celebrity portraits on that fence.
``Whose are these?'' Salmon asked as he began tearing them off.
Down came James Dean. Down came Kate Winslet. Zhang sprinted to
gather them up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad, it's sad,'' said Melissa James, a tourist from South
Carolina, whose daughter Savanna, 4, was sitting for a portrait.
Ms. James quickly handed over $20 as the artists packed up in a
flurry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, four sidewalk artists sued the city, asserting that
their First Amendment rights had been infringed upon by a
requirement that they have permits to sell their work outside the
Metropolitan Museum of Art. The suit, which is pending, cited a
1996 federal court decision that found the city's licensing of
street artists unconstitutional. But the city argued that it could
require the permits because the land outside the museum was owned
by the city's Parks and Recreation Department.
</P>
<P>
   In Central Park, another group of Chinese artists sketches each
afternoon at Wien Walk at 59th Street and Fifth Avenue. To work
there, each artist pays $25 a month for a Parks Department permit.
</P>
<P>
   Laws on street vending in connection with congestion and safety
are not uniformly enforced and vary from precinct to precinct, said
Mitchell Duneier, a sociologist and the author of ``Sidewalk''
(Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, 1999), a study of New York street
vendors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individual vendors often don't know about these standards and
can't defend their rights,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The knowledge barrier is magnified when the sidewalk artists and
the police do not speak the same language, as in the case of the
Chinese portraitists. A few have been working in Times Square for
10 years, but some, like Zhang, arrived less than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   They charge $20 for each person in a portrait, have two to four
customers a night, and ``save little by little,'' Lin said, for
rent on apartments, many of them rat-infested. Most of them live in
Flushing, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Lin, who came to New York in 1995, was looking for work when he
stumbled across the Times Square portraitists in 1996. He had
studied fashion design in Guangzhou University in the capital of
Guangdong province, but took up the charcoal pencil to put food on
his table. Since then, he said, he has studied at the Fashion
Institute of Technology and hopes to work in that industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is too expensive,'' he said. ``It's bad for your
health. It's too crowded, too noisy. Once I'm rich, I'll move
somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes after Salmon had left, four artists had set up
easels again at the Reuters Building. Lin waved for three other
friends, including Zhang, to follow him.
</P>
<P>
   They wandered up Seventh Avenue to 46th Street, stopped next to
a newsstand and began laying out their celebrity portraits. Lin had
his gripes about the city, but for now it was as good a backdrop
for his canvas as any.

EDITORIAL: THE DEBILITATED RUSSIAN MILITARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Tuesday, Jan. 18: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's recent setbacks in Chechnya suggest that the
decade-long deterioration of Russia's conventional military forces
has not yet been checked. The Chechnya operations have been
characterized by command failures, overreliance on crude and
obsolete weaponry and sparing use of regular Russian ground forces,
whose combat readiness is uncertain and morale unsteady.
</P>
<P>
   Although Americans may feel relieved that Russian conventional
forces are now too weak to pose a serious external threat, there is
a worrisome side to Russia's military breakdown. Moscow's defense
planners have placed greater reliance on nuclear weapons to resist
potential attack. Further, there is a risk that battlefield
failures in Chechnya during the coming Russian presidential
campaign could spur demands for a costly and wasteful military
buildup.
</P>
<P>
   Russia needs to repair its armed forces. But it should do so
through rational downsizing and modernization, not by a futile
attempt to rebuild along Cold War lines. Large-scale
remilitarization would draw away resources and energies urgently
needed for reviving the economy and reinvigorating government
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has learned some lessons from its first disastrous
campaign in Chechnya from 1994 to '96. In the first phase of the
current campaign Russian forces advanced steadily, behind
inaccurate but lethal artillery and air strikes, through the
lowlands of northern Chechnya. This approach broke down once the
war reached its present stage of fighting in the mountains of
southern Chechnya and the urban outskirts of Grozny, the Chechen
capital. In recent weeks Chechen guerrillas have staged effective
counterattacks and even managed to retake some areas from Russian
control.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin needs to reconfigure Russia's military forces to
better fit the country's post-Cold War needs and resources. In the
past dozen years, Russian troop strength has shrunk from around
five million to about a million and a half. Investment in
everything from nuclear weapons maintenance to new aircraft and
tanks has dried up. Military salaries are paid erratically,
recruits are treated brutally and conscription orders are widely
ignored. While Russia's nuclear weapons still appear to be under
effective political control, security at nuclear installations has
deteriorated and power and communications interruptions are
alarmingly frequent.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear weapons reduction negotiations with the United States
must be revitalized. Russia's new parliament should quickly ratify
the long-stalled 1993 treaty with Washington that provides for
Russia's present total of some 6,700 nuclear warheads to be cut
almost in half. Formal talks should then begin on a new treaty to
bring warhead levels well below 2,000. America can encourage Russia
to reform its military forces. But the first steps must be taken by
Moscow. The place to begin is by disengaging Russian troops from
Chechnya at the earliest possible date.

TELEVISION'S RISKY RELATIONSHIP

   The New York Times says in an editorial Tuesday, Jan. 18: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For about two years the White House and the television industry
have been engaged in a cozy little enterprise that, on the surface,
seems to promise benefits for everyone. The administration's
anti-drug campaign gets a boost. The television industry gets to
add dollars to the bottom line. But on closer inspection, it is a
deeply unhealthy arrangement that should disturb anyone who
believes in the need for all media _ the entertainment industry as
well as the networks _ to remain free from government meddling.
</P>
<P>
   Under the arrangement, according to an article in this week's
Salon Internet magazine, television networks have been secretly
submitting scripts for some of their most popular television shows
to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy as a way
of getting more than $22 million worth of credit for required
public service advertising. Barry McCaffrey, President Clinton's
drug czar, then allots advertising points for segments that convey
an anti-drug message _ a scene in which a youth rejects an offer of
marijuana, for example, or a passage showing a group of drugged-out
teen-agers looking like losers.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of exchanging content for advertising credits evolved
from a 1997 congressional mandate that for every dollar of
anti-drug advertising purchased by the government from a network,
the network was required to donate another dollar's worth of
advertising time to discourage drug abuse. When ad sales were down,
networks were more willing to sell the government what was, in
effect, half-price advertising time. With ad sales booming, the
McCaffrey content-for-dollars alternative offered a way for
networks to free advertising time to be sold at normal rates.
</P>
<P>
   The networks and the White House deny that content was changed
or creativity dampened in the process. But according to the
article, examples of how segments were revised to send their
message are ``as subtle as a brick through a window.'' The public,
however, has no way to assess the revisions, since the White House
has stubbornly and unwisely refused to release even the list of
participating programs.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its impact on particular shows, exchanging content for
dollars is a bad idea, as ABC-TV has acknowledged by ending the
arrangement with the White House this season. In allowing
government to shape or even to be consulted on content in return
for financial rewards, the networks are crossing a dangerous line
they should not cross. On the far side of that line lies the
possibility of censorship and state-sponsored propaganda.

CAMBY THROWS KNICKS A LIFELINE AS THEY TOP PISTONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Under an ominous scoreboard that was growing
uncomfortably tight, Allan Houston on Monday tried to barge his way
through a thicket of Pistons like an outlaw throwing open a saloon
door. It wasn't his style. Once he saw trouble brewing under the
basket, once he glimpsed the Pistons standing their ground, Houston
forced up a desperate layup that went splat against the glass and
seemed destined to fall into the posse of Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   But as quick as a flashbulb, the spindly Marcus Camby sliced
through a crack and hovered above the paint long enough to grab the
awkward miss in the air and turn it into a two-handed,
crowd-awakening dunk. It was like old times. Just like the playoffs
last season. It was Camby to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Houston's missed shot giving the Pistons life, Camby
pulled the plug on their last chance to cut deeper into the Knicks'
once bulky 16-point, fourth-quarter lead. Instead of a 9-point game
potentially heading to 7, Camby's levitation act put his team at a
double-digit lead for good with two minutes to go in the Knicks
105-94 victory Monday at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   As the cheers lapped up against Camby upon his dunk, he turned
to Houston and thanked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was saying to him that it was a good pass,'' said Camby, who
turned in a dominating 22-point, 15-rebound performance against a
hot Detroit team. ``I guess I kind of bailed him out on that
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Each Knick bailed out the other. It was a turnaround from last
Wednesday's game when Grant Hill, Jerry Stackhouse and Lindsey
Hunter scored 29 points apiece against the Knicks. This time,
Sprewell played Hill as closely as a dance partner and helped hold
him to a 5-for-21 day from the field. This time, Houston, Charlie
Ward and Chris Childs each kept his man in front of him and would
not be burned off the dribble by Stackhouse (19 points) and Hunter
(1 point).
</P>
<P>
   That defensive effort created misses by the Pistons (21-16) and
rebounds for Patrick Ewing (14 points, 10 rebounds) and Camby. For
one of the few times this season, the Knicks (23-14) outrebounded
an opponent, holding a 48-38 edge over the Pistons. Last Wednesday,
the Pistons shot 50 percent on the Knicks. Monday, the Knicks held
them to 43.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were definitely out for a little revenge,'' said Sprewell,
who finished with a team-high 23 points. ``We wanted to keep them
from getting those big numbers. But we didn't really expect to hold
them down like we did.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In truth, Hill missed some shots he normally makes, especially
on the tear he had been on over the previous seven games, a stretch
when he was hitting 60 percent of his shots. While Sprewell and
Larry Johnson did well to harass him, bump him on his cuts and deny
him the ball, there was a sluggishness to Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little off,'' said Hill, who finished with 16 points.
``I had trouble getting to the basket and I missed about five shots
I usually make. It is rare when Jerry and I are both off. Usually
one of us can pick it up and carry us.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the Knicks allow it. Over the last month, the Knicks
have made building big leads and losing them a habit.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever motivated them, the Knicks shook off their lazy habits
Monday and ran back in transition, including a hustling Ewing.
Throughout the game, he was in position to grab rebounds and make
plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like 1987 all over again, the way he was going up on
the offensive glass,'' Camby said. ``He played a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was better than his last one. Against Charlotte, Ewing sat
out the entire fourth quarter and was unhappy about Van Gundy's
decision. After accepting his first fourth-quarter benching well
two weeks ago, Ewing said Monday, ``Whatever I feel, I'm going to
keep to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever bothered Ewing, he had a catharsis on the floor. He was
everywhere. For most of the game, he and Camby worked side by side
to make sure the Knicks' 16-point lead with 10 minutes 32 seconds
left in the game was not going to slip away. At least not
completely. After the Pistons cut it to 6 points with 5:17 left in
the game, Sprewell came up with a jumper and Camby soared in for a
tip in off a miss by Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   There was a sigh of relief for the Knicks until Christian
Laettner cut free for a layup that left the Pistons within 98-89
with 2:28 left. A few seconds later, Camby was there to put an end
to the suspense. Although he has few plays ever run for him,
somehow, some way, he found enough cracks in the Pistons to come up
with 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to be hot forever,'' said Camby who reached
his season-high of 23 points in the season-opener but had rarely
been that dominant since. ``I'm content and happy. I like coming
off the bench. Me and Chris Childs, we have that chemistry. Today,
it was like last year, when we got it going in the playoffs.''

FINANCIAL WOES CLOUD PATHMARK'S FUTURE IN POOR AREAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the last decade, Pathmark has sought to expand
its established presence in low-income neighborhoods, where other
chains declined to venture. It has been a successful part of their
business, despite perilous predictions.
</P>
<P>
   But now the chain's future in poor urban areas has been cast in
doubt by mounting debt, a failed merger attempt and other financial
problems, according to market analysts and company officials.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they say, Pathmark's efforts to build additional
supermarkets, including one in Harlem that is considered a
centerpiece of the area's economic redevelopment, are in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would still like to work with the people of Harlem,''
Harvey Gutman, a senior vice president at the supermarket giant,
based in New Jersey, said when asked about the prospects of
building the Harlem market.
</P>
<P>
   The worries about Pathmark's financial health come a month after
a failed corporate marriage that promised to erase much of the
company's nearly $2.5 billion debt and to guarantee its presence in
low-income areas, where stores have generally been profitable for
Pathmark.
</P>
<P>
   The problems could force the company to retrench in many
neighborhoods, both rich and poor. But the concern among advocates
for the poor is that no other supermarket company will take the
risk to invest in low-income neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market niche they carved was borrowed from `Star Trek,'''
Paul Fetscher, a market analyst who is the president of Great
American Brokerage in Manhattan, said, referring to the show's
theme of boldly going where no one had gone before.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did an excellent job of going into minority areas and
developing excellent stores,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pathmark is sagging under the huge debt that it incurred when it
was taken private in 1987 by an investment group headed by Merrill
Lynch. Because heavy interest payments burned up much of its cash,
the company was unable to expand quickly enough, fiscal analysts
say.
</P>
<P>
   So, for two years Pathmark has been searching for a suitor that
could acquire the company and much of its accumulated debt. Last
March, Pathmark thought it had found one: Royal Ahold, an
aggressive Dutch food retailer, which offered to take on its debt
and buy the company for $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Ahold officials said publicly many times that they admired
Pathmark's ability to do so well in poor communities and planned to
continue those efforts. But nine months later, the deal fell apart,
under objections from the Federal Trade Commission. Federal
officials, while not specifically barring the merger, expressed
strong reservations about allowing Royal Ahold, which already owned
Edwards supermarkets, to have such a hold on the New York market.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Pathmark officials have said they fear that their
financial troubles have placed them in a position with limited
options: being acquired by another company, a drastic refinancing
and reorganization, or bankruptcy. It is a position that is
supported by market analysts, like Fetscher.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really only have three choices,'' Fetscher said, adding
that the trade commission decision, ruling out competitors in the
New York market, made it tough to find a company to acquire
Pathmark.
</P>
<P>
   The best case, those officials said, would be for another
company to acquire Pathmark and take on its debt, but few larger
food retailers seem to be in a position to make such a purchase.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This year alone, Pathmark is scheduled to make a $116 million
debt payment, a position that places the company's plans for a
supermarket at 145th Street and Bradhurst Avenue in jeopardy,
company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of other companies are bidding for the
30,000-square-foot project, but, given its track record, Pathmark
had been seen as the leading contender. The market is seen as
important to the neighborhood, because aside from Pathmark's East
Harlem store, the only other large market is a Fairway on 133rd
Street, which caters as much to Upper West Siders as to Harlem
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Fairclough, the director of the supermarket project for
the Community Food Resources Center, an advocacy group for the
poor, said, ``We've worked consistently to get larger supermarkets
into low-income neighborhoods, and it is a loss for New York City
if Pathmark stays in a holding pattern or has to retrench.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates are equally concerned that Pathmark stores may decline
in quality or that they could be taken over by a company with a
different set of corporate values. ``Pathmark is really th
supermarket chain that has made a commitment and taken the risk to
develop in low-income neighborhoods,'' Ms. Fairclough said.
</P>
<P>
   Pathmark's future has also become a concern for C. Virginia
Fields, the Manhattan borough president.
</P>
<P>
   As a city councilwoman, Ms. Fields helped the company overcome
objections from local retailers who did not want the
53,000-square-foot supermarket built five years ago on 125th Street
in East Harlem, and she considers the store one of her more
important accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Daglian, a spokeswoman for Ms. Fields, said the borough
president's office was still working with Pathmark and was
optimistic about the proposals for the 145th Street store.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a lot of work to get Pathmark to the 125th Street
location, and they have shown a lot of tenacity in the face of a
lot of adversity there,'' Ms. Daglian said. ``We would hope
ultimately that if they are taken over by another corporation, the
values and the interest that Pathmark has shown in investing in
lower-income communities are still reflected.''

FOR GRANT HILL, TO STAY OR GO IS THE ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)   (bl)  
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grant Hill was asked recently whether he would consider
returning close to his childhood home in Reston, Va., and playing
for the Washington Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I would want to be that close to my parents,''
Hill said, breaking up a room.
</P>
<P>
   The most accomplished all-around player in basketball today has
received many inquiries lately. Able to exercise an escape clause
in his contract this summer, the player the Detroit Pistons have
tethered their image to can up and leave if he wants.
</P>
<P>
   Loyalty is a plummeting commodity in sports, and if Hill signs a
long-term extension with the Pistons, it would be a sappy,
feel-good story for the National Basketball Association, a genuine
blow to the current culture of Leverage and Leave.
</P>
<P>
   But is that genuinely good for the league? What if Grant Hill,
27, whose off day at Madison Square Garden against the New York
Knicks on Monday barely detracted from his recent run of 40-point
nights, winds up 10 years from now in the same city, without a
title, wondering hard and long whether he should have left when had
a chance?
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing admitted recently he often thought about whether
he had remained in New York too long, holding onto a dying dream.
Dan Marino is at the end in Miami, his Dolphins much further from
the Super Bowl than they were with Marino in 1985. He, too,
probably asks himself if he stayed with same franchise beyond its
championship shelf life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to way lean one way or the other,'' Hills begins when
asked if loyalty is important, ``but it definitely is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You respect guys either way. Some people leave, some people
stay. In both situations, people are successful. And in both
situations, people fail.
</P>
<P>
   `` Joe Dumars, I respect him a lot,'' he said of his former
Piston teammate, who played out his entire career in Detroit.
``Charles Barkley, I also respect him a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley only played for three teams in his career, but at the
end he was treating the NBA like a game of musical chairs, hoping
beyond hope he could sit down with a team on the cusp of a title.
When he saw slippage in Philadelphia and later Phoenix, Barkley
found a way to move on to Houston, to convince himself life would
be better in another city.
</P>
<P>
   Hill can earn nearly $20 million more by staying in Detroit one
more season and re-signing in 2001, based on experience. The
Pistons could pay him $103 million, while the most any other team
in the league could pay him is $86 million.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he needs the extra cash. Hill, the league's endorsement
king since Michael Jordan retired, is selling much more than the
NBA. Soft drinks. Designer watches. His smile is almost as golden
as his game. His wife, the Grammy-nominated singer Tamia
Washington, is 20-car-pileup beautiful. We should all have his
problems.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, like Jordan after five years, Hill has not won a
playoff series. The Pistons have built nicely around him, put a
cadre of spot-up shooters in place so when Hill is finished
breaking down a defense, he has someone to drop in shots for him.
But though they came into Monday's matinee having won 9 of their
last 10 games, they have yet acquire a true point guard or
dependable center.
</P>
<P>
   After all, you only go so far in this league with one All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   So Grant Hill will soon have to make a decision. Pull up from
the perimeter and take a comfortable jump shot? Or drive hard to
the rim, head down, uncertainty in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the real legends of the modern era _ Michael,
Larry and Magic _ and they were with one team,'' said Jud Buechler,
Hill's teammate who also played with Jordan in Chicago. ``I think
that means something to Grant. Then again, there is another side to
it: Are you going to get to that next level?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that he may not figure out until we've shown
what we can do in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, at least Hill will soon relate to what Jordan is
going through these days. Asked what he thought of Jordan deciding
whether to purchase a stake in the Wizards and take over their
basketball operations, he said, ``I just can't understand why he'd
want to do that. It just seems like it's beneath him. Not to be an
owner, but to be a GM.''
</P>
<P>
   You mean, all the scouting, the game film, the haggling over
contracts?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I just can't see him living in D.C.,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course. Too close to the parents. &QL;

   The one-way fare is $245 in first class and $172 in second
class, called standard class by British Rail, which operates
Eurostar trains jointly with the French and Belgian railroads.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the first-class fare on the overnight train is a
reclining seat for sleeping and dinner and breakfast. On the day
train, breakfast and lunch are served to first-class passengers.
Second-class passengers on both trains ride in coach seats, and no
meals are included in the fare. Information: Rail Europe, which

<P>
   Small Change Adds Up On Airline Taxes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sharp-eyed passengers will notice alterations in the tax boxes
on airline tickets purchased since New Year's. Some taxes went up,
some went down. The net results, though not huge, graphically
demonstrate that nickels and dimes certainly add up.
</P>
<P>
   The main change is on tickets for international trips. The
United States tax for arrival or departure rose to $12.40 from
$12.20, an increase of 40 cents for a round trip. In addition, the
Agriculture Department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
fee for arrival from overseas rose to $3 from $2.05, an increase of
95 cents. Combined, these two raise a round-trip overseas ticket by
$1.35.
</P>
<P>
   Trips to and from Alaska and Hawaii, or between the two states,
face an international facilities tax, which rose 10 cents, to $6.20
from $6.10.
</P>
<P>
   On domestic trips, flight segment taxes, which began life at $1
each in 1997 and are going to reach $3 on Jan. 1, 2002, took a
25-cent step up on Jan. 1, to $2.50 from $2.25. Each segment _ that
is, each flight you get on and off _ generates a tax. Offsetting
this, the domestic ticket tax, which was 10 percent before Oct. 1,
1997, dropped to 7.5 percent last Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Most airports levy a passenger-facility charge of $3, but no
passenger pays more than $12 a ticket, one way or round trip,
however many airports the trip involves.
</P>
<P>
   When there are not enough boxes on the ticket to list all the
taxes, some may be bundled under the code XT. &QL;

   Geometric Abstraction Adorns Paris Museum  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The zigzag of bright blue neon clinging to the facade of the
Musee Zadkine in Paris represents a tiny sliver of infinity for the
French artist Francois Morellet. By assigning geometrical degrees
to the open-ended procession of pi decimals, Morellet, born in
1926, fashions free-wheeling neon arcs that, theoretically, can
ramble forward to the end of time, thanks to the expansiveness of
pi and the indefatigability of modern computers.
</P>
<P>
   Pi, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter,
is approximately 3.14159265, but the sequence of numbers beyond the
decimal point is believed to be infinite.
</P>
<P>
   Through March 5, Morellet's prints and neon constructions,
including three small-scale allusions to his ``Geometree'' works
that incorporate branches and twigs into witty geometric forms,
mingle with the permanent collection of 20th century sculpture by
Ossip Zadkine (1890-1967) at the secluded garden museum, 100 bis
Rue d'Assas, which was established in the artist's former house and
studio in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   An emblematic figure of Geometric Abstraction, Morellet has
often used sequences of random numbers, notably from the telephone
book, to fuel his imagination. The off-kilter curves of the pi
series, which the artist compares to the pleats of a badly battered
accordion, took shape in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Fragments of the neon Rococo pi series illuminated the facades
of the train station in Tours and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in
Bourges in 1999. Morellet intends to pursue this ``infinite
progression'' to new sites in Germany and America. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Musee Zadkine houses a research library and displays over
100 works from Zadkine's primitive, cubist, classic and abstract
periods. Information: (33-1) 43.26.91.90. Open Tuesday to Sunday 10
a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Admission: $4.80 at 6.2 francs to the dollar.

   Guides That Help Trace Jewish Roots &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They're not what you'd tuck into your knapsack for picking out
the best restaurants in Warsaw or a place to lay your head in Kiev,
but Miriam Weiner's voluminous guides to archives in Eastern Europe
could be very helpful for anyone trying to trace Jewish family
roots to the vanished world of pre-Holocaust Poland, Ukraine and
Moldova (which incorporates the former Bessarabia).
</P>
<P>
   The encyclopedic volumes _ ``Jewish Roots in Ukraine and
Moldova,'' published last year, and ``Jewish Roots in Poland,''
which came out in 1998 _ offer town-by-town listings of archives,
from birth, death, marriage and divorce records to voter and tax
rolls, draft registrations and property listings, some going back
to the 1700s.
</P>
<P>
   The books, published by the Routes to Roots Foundation and the
Yivo Institute for Jewish Research, are lavishly illustrated with
maps, photos and period postcards, many eerily tranquil
(considering what was to come) and some just eerie. Whose idea was
it, for example, to print up postcards of actual pogrom scenes?
</P>
<P>
   While it is often assumed that records of Jewish life in Eastern
Europe were expunged by the Nazis, much information survives, says
Ms. Weiner, who has spent the better part of a decade in transit
unearthing and mapping the documents, with the help of archivists
and municipal officials in former Soviet republics and Poland.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the town of Priluki in the Chernigov district of
Ukraine, northeast of Kiev, where Ms. Weiner's forebears came from,
was found to be rich in police files, school records, occupation
lists and census forms dating back to 1788 in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   For those interested in taking their research to the next stage
_ a trip to the localities and their archives _ Ms. Weiner's travel
agency, Routes to Roots in Secaucus, N.J., sets up genealogical
tours for individuals and families. The books cost $50 (Poland) and
$60 (Ukraine and Moldova), plus $8 shipping and handling. To order,
call (800) 742-5403 or visit www.rtrfoundation.org. For more
information about the book: (201) 866-4075.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When shares of Cynet Inc. begin trading on the Nasdaq exchange
at noon Tuesday the first day of stock trading after Martin Luther
King Jr. Day, it is believed that the fax and Internet company will
become the first African-American-managed publicly traded company
in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very exciting time. We're entering the new
millennium energized and with great expectations,'' said Chairman
and Chief Executive Vincent W. Beale Sr., who owns 57 percent of
Cynet's stock. ``I would like to see Cynet as the leader in the
Internet messaging arena.''
</P>
<P>
   While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission does not track
racial data on publicly held companies, Houston Mayor Lee Brown's
office, the Houston Minority Business Council, state Sen. Rodney
Ellis, D-Houston, and others believe that Cynet is the first
African-American public company in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The company will trade under the symbols CYNE and CYNX. However,
Cynet's listing on the Nasdaq is not an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   It's a low-key trading debut that's the culmination of a rare
stock swap known as a recision offering. Vincent Beale and the rest
of his management team _ his brother Sam, a lawyer, and his brother
Bernard, a former investment banker who is chief operating officer
_ are relieved that they got Cynet to this day.
</P>
<P>
   When the Beale brothers took over the company in 1998 after
working there briefly as consultants, Cynet's finances were in
disarray.
</P>
<P>
   Its 1997 revenues were $4.96 million, but it had pretax net
losses of $7.76 million and cash-flow losses of $6.85 million,
according to its prospectus. Its fax transmission business was
losing its luster against the growth of the Internet, and making
matters worse, the company's founder, Ray C. Davis, had issued
approximately 26.8 million shares _ in violation of U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission procedures _ to a tangle of 855
shareholders in 39 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``We inherited them from the founder, who was a very good
promoter,'' Vincent Beale said.
</P>
<P>
   Without being in compliance with SEC regulations, the Beale
brothers couldn't take on institutional investors to raise the
money they needed to transform the business. They had no choice but
to make their shareholders legal through an obscure SEC stock
buyback procedure called a recision offering. Last fall, Cynet gave
the owners of $16.5 million worth of shares the option to cash out.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules of a recision offering, the Beale brothers
couldn't campaign to keep shareholders on board, so they held
shareholder information sessions around the country, including two
in Houston, to try to answer questions candidly and show that there
were three new trustworthy faces at the helm of the company.
</P>
<P>
   When the recision offering was completed Dec. 6, Cynet bought
back $5.5 million in shares and officially became a publicly held
company, Sam Beale said.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the year, the Beales knew that they would need money to
fund the recision offering, so they approached Enron Corp.'s
Houston Economic Opportunity Fund, which took a 6 percent ownership
stake in Cynet.
</P>
<P>
   Because no investment bank was interested in underwriting the
recision offering, Enron also became the underwriter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in the business of underwriting securities. Instead
of just selling us equity, the company needed us to act as
underwriters,'' said Mark Lay, director of the Enron fund.
``Because of Vincent's focus on getting that done, they were able
to mitigate a very large risk issue that was overhanging the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   After a breather over the holidays, Tuesday's trading represents
Cynet's official entry into the open marketplace, not a
fund-raising effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's stock that's already in the hands of shareholders. We
did not raise any new money in this offering. Our goal is to raise
that new money in a second offering in 2000,'' Sam Beale said.
</P>
<P>
   Until Cynet can make that second offering, it will continue to
be bound &UR;  &LR; by the strings of the recision offering.
</P>
<P>
   While other companies hire an investment company as a ``market
maker'' to promote the stock to other brokers when the company
enters the market, under the SEC rules, market maker Harris Webb &AMP;
Garrison can't make a pitch for Cynet.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   ``We are precluded from doing anything that is of a promotional
nature for this company. We are just a facilitator in this
instance,'' said compliance administrator Cary McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time Harris Webb &AMP; Garrison has been a silent
market maker, McDonald added.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when Internet companies make such a splash on their
first day of trading, entering the stock market without a
traditional underwriter and without a market maker could put Cynet
at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be extremely unusual. Often it's a sign of a very
small company or one with a checkered background,'' said Sanders,
Morris Mundy Chairman George Ball, who was asked to comment on what
this general set of circumstances might mean. ``Lacking a
third-party sponsor, however, is a definite detriment in the
money-raising process.''
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   However, the Beales, who came to Cynet as advisers and ended up
buying the company when founder Ray C. Davis got sick, are unfazed.
</P>
<P>
   They say they hope to raise as much as $150 million in a public
offering later this year to fund Cynet's transition from fax
messaging to business-to-business Internet services, wireless
technology and database services, and that Cynet will gobble up
other companies to muscle its way into the Internet applications
arena.
</P>
<P>
   Cynet's main business always has been faxing. Customers ranging
from mom-and-pop companies to Fortune 500 clients use Cynet's fax
broadcasting network to keep costs down. They also use a messaging
software at Cynet that enables them to type fax numbers, e-mail
addresses and Telex numbers in the same line of a message to reach
clients at different levels of technology.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Cynet has begun selling its line of wireless
modems, which will begin appearing in Round Rock, Texas-based Dell
Computer's small &UR; - &LR; business catalog in February. It also has
launched Cynet Interactive, a division that builds Web sites to
allow companies to run business-application software directly from
the Internet, Bernard Beale said.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the hands of the Beales, Cynet's finances appear to be
turning the corner. Revenues nearly doubled to $8.95 million in
1998, while its operating losses were nearly cut in half to $4.23
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to see Cynet as a hypergrowth company in a hypergrowth
time,'' Vincent Beale said.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a crash course in New York racial politics,
Hillary Rodham Clinton observed Martin Luther King's birthday in a
flurry of celebrations from Brooklyn to Harlem on Monday, tying
King's legacy to her own political ambitions while denouncing what
she and some ministers asserted was a racial divide marking Rudolph
Giuliani's years as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, the Republican mayor and Mrs. Clinton's probable
opponent in this year's race for U.S. Senate, kept a more limited
schedule, skipping annual celebrations that he had attended in the
past in favor of smaller events organized by black supporters.
Giuliani's aides said he declined invitations to the larger events
after learning that Mrs. Clinton would be there and concluding that
they would be politically charged.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton took advantage of Giuliani's absences, giving three
audiences a prepared speech in which she talked about hearing the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. speak when she was a child in a white,
middle-class suburb of Chicago and implicitly denounced Giuliani's
leadership style.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, speaking in soft and measured tones, said: ``If I
am given the privilege of representing the people of New York, I
would want to be defined as someone who unites, not divides. I want
to be defined by who I lift up, not by who I push down.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a hectic and tense day that often verged on chaos,
providing Mrs. Clinton with a vivid glance of what it is going to
be like for her to be a candidate for public office in New York. A
huge press entourage accompanied her, intent on observing the
spectacle of her first public appearance with the Rev. Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the celebration of King's birthday also served to
highlight the delicate situations facing Mrs. Clinton and Giuliani
in a prominent election. Giuliani's decision to avoid the kind of
appearances where he has been booed in the past reflects that his
standing among black voters is at a particularly low point, coming
after a succession of demonstrations organized by Sharpton that
protested police tactics.
</P>
<P>
   For Mrs. Clinton, visiting Sharpton carried definite political
risks, and had been resisted by some of her advisers. For all
Sharpton's influence among black voters _ as evidenced by the
procession of senior Democratic elected officials who stopped by to
pay tribute to him Monday _ he remains a highly unpopular figure
among many white voters, and is frequently a target of Giuliani's
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said through aides that he had chosen to miss the two
other events Mrs. Clinton attended _ at the Convent Avenue Baptist
Church in Harlem and the Brooklyn Academy of Music _ because the
organizers had also invited Mrs. Clinton. In the past, Giuliani has
been booed at those events, including when he was running for
re-election against Ruth W. Messinger in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani attended a dinner organized by the Congress of Racial
Equality Monday night, and he presided over a muted prayer
breakfast at Gracie Mansion with black clerics, black Republican
leadeadministration officials, where he spoke briefly, and
reverentially, about King.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the two best ways to reflect him, so we don't begin to
interpret him in a way in which he really didn't intend,'' Giuliani
said, ``is to, No. 1, to read what he said rather than what other
people have to say about it, and No. 2, to pray, because I think
that's the thing that he would tell us to do. He would tell us to
pray, in order to get guidance.''

LIFE IS EASIER IN BRAZIL AS FAMILY SIZE SHRINKS 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JENALIA MORENO 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Even by Brazilian standards, Musa
Cipriano comes from a big family.
</P>
<P>
   In her home state of Minas Gerais, her farmer father and mother,
a part-time cook, struggled to support Cipriano and her 10 brothers
and sisters. Cipriano's grandmother bore even more children _ 19.
</P>
<P>
   Cipriano moved to Rio de Janeiro seeking a better life. She did
two things to ensure she reached that goal: She found a job as a
hotel cook, and she made sure she had only one child.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at age 45, she says her life is 10 times better than that
of her parents. Cipriano made that optimistic pronouncement as she
watched her 11-year-old daughter, Ana Musa, graduate from the
fourth grade, the highest grade Cipriano reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in Rio, everyone understands that if you have more kids,
then it's more difficult,'' said Cipriano, who earns the equivalent
of $330 a month. ``If you have more than one or two kids, then
they're going to be hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   That realization by millions of Brazilian matriarchs translated
into a decline of more than 50 percent in the nation's fertility
rate over the last three decades. A similar trend took more than a
century in developed countries, such as the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1970s, Brazilian women gave birth to an average of six
children. This year, demographers predict that Brazilian women will
bear an average of 2.2 children, nearly balancing the country's
birth and death rate.
</P>
<P>
   That sudden drop concerns Brazilian demographers, who fear that
Brazil's aging population will not be able to support the nation's
costly social security system.
</P>
<P>
   But, overall, a declining birth rate is good news for this Third
World nation seeking First World status.
</P>
<P>
   For Cipriano, a small family meant she could save money for Ana
Musa's college education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm living and saving so she can keep being educated,''
Cipriano said, beaming proudly. ``That's my function.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ability to save money and own a few of life's
luxuries, such as a television and kitchen appliances, Cipriano can
only afford a home in the CantaGalo favela, one of more than 500
slums. She and her daughter live in one of the shacks that are
stacked like various sizes of shoe boxes, awkwardly perched on the
sides of mountains in Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   As in many favelas, in CantaGalo, streams of sewage drip down
the streets. Few homes have electricity. Brazil's once-exploding
population meant that the government could not keep up with
infrastructure demands. Today, 32 percent of homes do not have
telephone lines, and 21 percent do not have sewage service.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller families mean that the Brazilian government can invest
more in such basics as sewers and utilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you continue to have six children, you can't develop in
the face of that,'' said Carl Haub, a demographer for the
Population Reference Bureau in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller families also means a lower unemployment rate, now at
7.3 percent, and more government funds for health care and
education.
</P>
<P>
   For U.S. manufacturers, a lower fertility rate means that
Brazil's 164 million residents can afford to buy more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil is emerging as the most important market in Latin
America, even more so than Mexico,'' said Haub of the nonprofit
think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's birth rate began to decline in the 1970s as birth
control became more widespread, women began to enter the work force
with a fury, and more residents moved to the cities. Urban living
meant that families did not need as many children to help on farms.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, the decline in fertility occurred with no
encouragement from the government. This is different from Mexico,
where a barrage of public service announcements urged couples to
take control of their own economic situation by having fewer
children. There, the fertility rate dropped from seven children per
woman in 1965 to an average of 2.4 this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fertility declined without any kind of public policy on family
planning,'' said Esther Hamburger, a Sao Paulo anthropologist.
``There was not an organized effort; that's why it was a
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Government may have stayed out of Brazilian bedrooms, but
television did not.
</P>
<P>
   Every weeknight, most of this nation is glued to its TV sets,
watching the latest one-hour telenovela, a soap opera that's often
far more glamorous than any ``Dallas'' episode. If there's no
important soccer match on, most bars and restaurants set their
dials to the latest telenovela.
</P>
<P>
   In telenovelas, most young couples have no children. Older
couples have no more than three children, and often they live in
luxurious homes or ranches.
</P>
<P>
   Many Brazilians want to emulate the lifestyle they see in these
dramas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role that television plays in the Brazilian economy is
higher than the role that it plays in other countries,'' said
Hamburger, who studied the effects of telenovelas on family size.
``Television was very important in the development of the consumer
market.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend was encouraged during the 1970s, when retailers began
advertising payment plans for everything from TV sets to clothing.
That gave the poor the opportunity to become consumers. Desperate
to appear connected to current events and a part of a society, they
sacrificed other household goods to buy televisions and radios.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reflects the desire to be tuned,'' Hamburger said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 87 percent of households have a TV set while 32 percent
have a washing machine and 82 percent of homes have a refrigerator.
</P>

   Single mother Deborah dos Santos lives in a rundown mansion,
abandoned when the poor took over this neighborhood to create
CantaGalo. Her home, a room she shares with nearly a dozen family
members, is simply decorated and has a tiny stove and two single
beds. In the corner is an older TV set, carefully protected by a
dust cover.
</P>
<P>
   She has an 8-month-old son, Jefferson, whose father is a street
kid with no job and no home. She once lived with her boyfriend on
the streets, but since Jefferson was born, she's moved home with
her mother and found a job in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Dos Santos, who earns the equivalent of $50 a month as a
computer teacher, said more children means a tougher life.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life isn't that great right now,'' said dos Santos, 16.

OPEN HOUSE FOR NEW ZEALAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ Russell Coutts and his crew were
invincible in the last America's Cup in 1995, and now they will
soon get the pleasure of defending the cup on home water. But they
can be beaten.
</P>
<P>
   It happened here on the Hauraki Gulf on Monday afternoon. With
Coutts at the helm and the gray-haired tactician Brad Butterworth
scheming by his side, the crew on NZL-57 was beaten convincingly to
the first mark and then outsailed in the light winds for the rest
of the race, trailing by nearly two minutes at the second windward
mark.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday's result won't be all that encouraging to the two
remaining challengers, America One and Prada, whose speedy spy
boats observed it all from the 200-meter legal distance. It won't
be encouraging because the boat that routed NZL-57 was NZL-60, the
newest of the two black yachts that Team New Zealand has built for
this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was only a practice day, like the day before it and so
many days, perhaps too many, before that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit frustrating actually,'' said Grant Loretz, a crew
member. ``We're itching to get out there and have a go, but our
turn is obviously going to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Sport has no shortage of long waits: four years between
Olympics, four years between soccer World Cups. But it has been
nearly five years since the last America's Cup, and while the
challengers for sport's oldest major trophy have been dueling under
genuine pressure for genuine points since October, Team New Zealand
has been conducting dress rehearsals and attempting to avoid the
pitfall of learning its lines so well that it no longer takes much
pleasure in saying them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this phase is the hardest thing I've had to do,'' said
Butterworth, a 40-year-old Aucklander, who was also the tactician
for Black Magic in 1995. ``We understood two years ago that we were
going to have to be a lot better than last time if we wanted to
defend, and so we've tuned up, and we've been working our skills
for a long time now.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday was also a day for working on communication skills, which
explains why Butterworth made his comments while NZL-57 was still
under sail and still on the gulf. For the first time since the
challenger series began, a small group of foreign journalists had
been invited on board one of New Zealand's new yachts, and as
trimmers yanked at their sheets and Coutts leaned and occasionally
yawned on his helm, reporters from France, Japan, China, Australia
and the United States attempted to interject without interfering as
the boat headed back to the harbor after the one-sided ersatz race.
</P>
<P>
   It did not have to be this way, of course. There could have been
defender trials, just as there have been for every cup in recent
history. But the syndicate head, Peter Blake, and his advisers
decided that New Zealand, with its 3.5 million people, was too
small to support rival syndicates and that splitting up the limited
sponsorship dollars and limited know-how would only weaken the
cause. The price to pay for solid financing, however, is the wait,
made all the longer by the challengers' decision not to practice
with them. (The only exception was Nippon Challenge, which did so
once in December.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always going to be difficult being the single defender,
but we've known that since the beginning, so I can't say it's a
surprise,'' said Coutts, the skipper and former Olympic gold
medalist. ``We've had some great races out here among our two
boats. We had one last week with four lead changes.''
</P>
<P>
   This had been billed as a day on the water with Team New
Zealand, but in truth, it was more a day on the water. Journalists
were allowed on board as the boats were towed from the Viaduct
Basin to the racecourse in the late morning and then again after
the race had been decided. In between, they followed the progress
of NZL-57 and NZL-60 from a chase boat, although _ this being the
America's Cup _ not all of their progress was visible. Shortly
before the races began, Coutts, concerned about security leaks,
asked for the chase boat and its occupants to leave the area for
about an hour. The visitors/inquisitors were not invited back until
after the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some general things we wanted to do that we'd
rather keep to ourselves,'' Butterworth said. ``Putting them on the
front page would not help our cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the surveillance tools at their would-be rivals'
disposal, despite the close quarters along syndicate row in the
Viaduct Basin, there are still secrets to be kept and technological
edges to be maintained. In 1995, when New Zealand swept Dennis
Conner and his American crew to win the cup by 5-0, its boat was
undeniably superior, partly because of an innovative rig.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand has continued innovating in that area: the mast used
on NZL-57 Monday has holes built into it that allow some of the
diagonal supporting cables to pass through it. It allows the Kiwis
to use three spreaders instead of four, presumably reducing wind
drag and pressure on the mast. But that is no longer a secret. Nor
is the fact that both new boats are significantly faster than their
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be lucky to win a race in the old boat against these,''
Coutts said. ``Very lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Coutts and Blake maintain that they have yet to decide which
yacht will be used in the cup match. They will declare both on
Thursday, the same day America One and Prada must declare which
boats they will use in the challenger finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually haven't decided on all the bits,'' Butterworth
said. ``This boat has a few bits that are pretty nice. So does the
other one. We'll have to swap them around, and get all the good
bits on one boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Coutts said the final decision won't be made until early
February. The cup is scheduled to begin Feb. 19. That is a
Saturday, and the spectator fleet is expected to number about
4,000, which should make for a much livelier scene than Monday's,
as only a handful of motorboats were in the immediate vicinity.
</P>
<P>
   The sailors, most of whom have known each other since they were
teen-agers, have been waiting for months. Their public has, too,
and the summer days when a black boat is guaranteed of victory on
the gulf are definitely, thankfully numbered.

MAMA CHOLA A ROLE MODEL FOR HERMOSILLO KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - Mama Chola watches proudly as a barrio teenager pounds
away at a punching bag.
</P>
<P>
   She teaches kids, the poorest of the poor, to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Against drugs.
</P>
<P>
   For themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Her real name is Francisca Gonzalez Gil, but everyone knows the
middle-age interloper by her gang nickname.
</P>
<P>
   She runs a school and boxing club for tough kids in Hermosillo,
Sonora's capital. And she fights for them, railing at a government
and culture that she believes have abandoned youth.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez Gil started this crusade six years ago, when her own
son slipped into gangs and narcotics. He is now studying to be a
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Her school is an abandoned mess next to a corner market.
Volunteers teach boxing to the young boys and stage occasional
tournaments on a rickety, wooden ring. Mama Chola teaches art in an
adjoining room - joyful, flowery pictures made from molded tin and
paint.
</P>
<P>
   There is another room, austere and small, for academic lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez Gil claimed this corner of Hermosillo without right or
invitation; she just moved in and set up shop. She says neighbors
didn't welcome her or trust her. The local pushers spread rumors to
turn people against her. But, slowly, kids came around, and help
followed.
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo's back streets offer few alternatives to vapors or
methamphetamine, which costs less than a meal.
</P>
<P>
   For Hermosillo's poor, the little cholos, as Gonzalez Gil calls
them, there are few resources, little help.
</P>
<P>
   The government? Gonzalez Gill shudders and quotes long-ago
Mexican President Benito Juarez: ``The law is for your enemies.''
It is an expression that both justifies and explains corruption.
</P>
<P>
   So she fights a lonely war, preaching against drugs that poison
people with greed, the drugs that spawn violence, destroy families
and breed crime. &QL;

GENE HARRIS, 66, JAZZ PIANIST WHO PLAYED BEBOP AND SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Idaho, Mich.)   (bl)  
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gene Harris, a jazz pianist who plied a polished, mainstream and
agreeably bright brand of blues, soul and bebop, died Jan. 16 at
his home in Boise, Idaho. He was 66.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from kidney failure a month before
he was expecting a kidney transplant from one of his daughters,
said The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Benton Harbor, Mich., Harris taught himself piano at age
9. His primary influences were boogie-woogie players like Albert
Ammons and Pete Johnson. Later, when his playing became more
mature, he absorbed the refined style of Oscar Peterson. After
joining the Army in 1951 he played in the 82nd Airborne Division
band, and after his discharge in 1954 he toured the country with
various band leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956 Harris formed his first band, the Four Sounds, which
lost a member within a year and became known as the Three Sounds.
The band, featuring Harris, the bassist Andy Simpkins and the
drummer Bill Dowdy, soon gained a following as it began playing
clubs around the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   The Three Sounds made several recordings through the 1960s and
'70s on the Blue Note label. Harris also played on other records
with groups led by Stanley Turrentine, James Clay, Milt Jackson,
Benny Carter and others.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977 Harris announced his semiretirement and moved to Boise.
But his career took on new life when he signed with Concord Records
in the mid-'80s. No fewer than 22 albums followed, the most recent
being ``Alley Cats,'' a live recording from last year. They ranged
from solo performances to sessions with groups like the Ray Brown
Trio to big-band dates.
</P>
<P>
   His earlier recordings include ``Anita O'Day and the Three
Sounds'' (Verve), ``The Three Sounds'' (Blue Note) and ``Astral
Signal'' (Blue Note). His album ``Tribute to Count Basie''
(Concord), featuring the Gene Harris All-Star Big Band, earned him
a nomination for a Grammy Award in 1988 in the category of Best Big
Band Jazz Instrumental.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Janie; two daughters, Beth and Niki,
and a son, Gene Harris Jr.

SMUGGLERS OFTEN BETRAY THEMSELVES

   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - Patting down a driver at the Nogales port of entry,
this is what Inspector Paul Bland noticed most: The guy's heart was
pounding out of his chest, and he was sweating like crazy.
</P>
<P>
   There were other signs as well.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Tellez, another U.S. Customs inspector, had noticed the
driver's nervous tics when he pulled his maroon Volkswagen Golf
into her lane at the port of entry. Her computer told her it wasn't
his car. Then a drug dog caught a scent.
</P>
<P>
   Bland yanked up the back seat. Instead of a foam cushion, there
were bricks of pot. Compartments under the carpet and in back of
the seat held more stashes.
</P>
<P>
   Flipping out a pocketknife, Bland dug into an oil-coated brick
and ran the blade slowly under his nose. ``Positive!'' he said,
grinning.
</P>
<P>
   Border warriors treat drug catches like game fish. Bland's,
snagged one morning last spring, weighed in at 67 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Often, it's the instincts of people such as Tellez and Bland,
plus basic, good detective work, that deliver the best payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   These days, it takes technology as well.
</P>
<P>
   The swarms of agents deployed along the border are equipped with
enough gizmos to embarrass the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   They roam southern Arizona wearing a new generation of
night-vision gear that turns night into day. Ground sensors and
live, low-light cameras planted along the border tell them when and
where people are moving.
</P>
<P>
   Infrared night scopes are posted on hills, letting agents spy on
several square miles of desert in the dead of night while staring
at consoles in their truck cabs.
</P>
<P>
   A remote-controlled drone with a videocamera patrols
southeastern Arizona and western New Mexico from the sky, hunting
for traffickers while an operator in a trailer miles away watches
the images on a screen.
</P>
<P>
   Sophisticated new radio equipment allows the many federal, state
and local law enforcement agencies chasing drugs to speak to each
other on a common frequency. Encryption gear keeps traffickers from
intercepting radio chatter.
</P>
<P>
   Vapor-tracing machines detect the presence of minute particles
of drugs or explosives at ports of entry.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Customs Service spent $130 million for new
dope-finding gear. A fair share of it is going into Arizona's busy
ports.
</P>
<P>
   Two things explain the evolution. The North American Free Trade
Agreement boosted traffic at major ports along the Southwestern
border. At the same time, the buildup of Border Patrol agents
between ports made smuggling through the ports themselves more
attractive. &QL; 
NEW ENFORCEMENT TOOLS
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Customs Service responded with Operation Hardline,
putting new tactics and gadgets into use at border ports. The idea
was to improve inspections and make them faster at a time when tons
of narcotics were moving through America's ports because smuggling
seams elsewhere were being zipped up.
</P>
<P>
   In Nogales, semi rigs line up two-by-two, deep into Mexico,
running a gantlet of inspection points. Inspectors swipe hand-held
density readers along trailers, looking for drug hollows as the
rigs roll by.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks pass through a drug screening building under a catwalk
that provides a bird's-eye view. Eventually, undercarriage cameras
will film the chassis. New databases track every vehicle's crossing
history, ownership and cargo manifest.
</P>
<P>
   If inspectors see something awry or get a hunch, trucks are
unloaded, drilled, tapped and X-rayed. Up to 80 a day get pulled
through a long metal shed that looks like a carwash. Inside, a $3
million scanner sends X-ray images to four video screens.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a $1 million mobile gamma ray scanner also was
installed to pass over 150 to 200 trucks daily as they roll into
Arizona. Another is planned over railroad tracks crossing the
border into downtown Nogales.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lovejoy, Customs' anti-smuggling director, says the
``non-intrusive'' inspection technology means that vehicles aren't
being ripped apart by inspectors as often and that traffic lines
are speeding up.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana and cocaine seizures are also on the rise. In 1995,
there were 54 seizures using imaging equipment. In 1998, there were
nearly five times that many.
</P>
<P>
   It's still a drop in the bucket. At most, only two in five rigs
rolling through Nogales are fully scanned for drugs, even with the
new gear in place. Many inspectors say that high-tech gear is nice
but that human eyes and instinct still make the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of your good inspectors out on the line, they live for
that seizure,'' said Jimmy Tong Jr., Douglas' port director. ``The
big payoff is just sheer experience and determination.'' &QL; 
DETAILS MAKE THE DIFFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the job is monotonous. Eight hours on your
feet. Freezing nights in January. Murderous afternoons in August.
Perpetual auto exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors watch drivers' nervous twitches or odd looks. Using
mirrors, mallets and electronic scopes, they poke and prod cars to
check for fresh paint, suspicious bulges, new welds, missing
screws.
</P>
<P>
   They scour immigrant documents, scan computerized crossing
histories and study regular crossers for unusual patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The watchers rotate every hour or so, moving from primary
inspection booths to secondary stations to the pedestrian lines.
Some teams are made up entirely of rovers. They stay on the move
throughout the port, so smugglers never know how to avoid them or
which lanes are safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nobody who knows where we're going to be or when,''
says Rick Gill, head of the Mobile Port Enforcement Team in
Nogales.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, a blitz is called, and every lane in the port is
stopped cold. Nobody is waved on. Drug-sniffing dogs dash in and
out of the traffic jam, noses alert for drugs on the move.
</P>
<P>
   In southbound lanes, teams of inspectors eyeball pedestrians and
traffic for contraband _ mostly stolen cars, drug money and guns _
heading to Mexico. Portable X-ray machines scan suspicious luggage.
The inspectors once found $102,000 inside a brand new stereo that a
man was taking into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   During a four-month period last winter, the Nogales southbound
team nabbed more than $500,000 heading into Mexico. &QL; 
NO SUCH THING AS AVERAGE
</P>
<P>
   The inspector's job demands vigilance. It's impossible to
anticipate the next load. It's just as impossible to categorize the
average smuggler.
</P>
<P>
   Few would have suspected the old Datsun carrying a Mexican man
and his two daughters through the Nogales port one evening last
spring. With a doll in a pink dress perched in its back window, the
car looked every bit like it was taking an average family to visit
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Inspector John Landers had a hunch. The driver's hands shook
slightly, and the 12-year-old girl was sprawled across the back
seat, taking up as much space as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Landers leaned inside to feel the seat. He got a whiff of
sweet-scented soap. The seat was rock-hard. Underneath were 24
packages of pot wrapped crudely in cellophane, mustard and soap
shavings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question we get is, `Do I look like a coker?' '' Douglas
Inspector Nicholas Castillo said. ``We don't answer that. Cokers
look young, old, female, male, Hispanic, Anglo.''
</P>
<P>
   They look like everyone. &QL;

AGILE SUSPECT CAUGHT AT CUSTOMS CHECKPOINT

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A fugitive who is believed to have eluded the police
in midtown Manhattan last Tuesday by leaping from a 19th-story
window to the ledge of an adjacent building was returned to New
York City on Monday after being stopped on a bus crossing into
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said that the suspect, Jaquan
Muhammad, was carrying a hand-written journal and three weapons
that linked him to a string of knifepoint robberies in Manhattan
and also indicated that he might have been involved in the stabbing
death of a Hunter College custodian in Brooklyn last month.
</P>
<P>
   The journal ``was very descriptive,'' said Dennis Murphy, a
spokesman for the U.S. Customs Service.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said Muhammad, 21, of Brooklyn, was detained at 6:15 a.m.
Sunday at a border checkpoint on the Peace Bridge, which spans the
Niagara River from Buffalo to Ontario. Muhammad arrived there on a
Greyhound bus, Murphy said, but was refused entry into Canada after
he was asked for identification during a routine immigration check.
He showed a passport in the name of Naftali Triplett, who is wanted
for an assault unrelated to the other crimes. Canadian border
agents who searched his luggage then found a sword and two knives,
Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad, whose sprint through the streets and his leap from an
East 53rd Street office tower led some newspapers to refer to him
as Spider-Man, is suspected in 13 knifepoint robberies of Manhattan
pedestrians, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Customs Service officials said Muhammad continued his efforts to
dodge the authorities even after he was detained Sunday. After
being briefly left alone by the border agents who were questioning
him in Buffalo, the officials said, Muhammad shinnied into the
crawl space of the ceiling in a Customs holding room. He was
recaptured after officers poked the ceiling panels with a
broomstick, causing him to fall to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Muhammad has been secured in leg irons and officers
were ``watching him like a hawk,'' a law enforcement official said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was not immediately charged with any crimes,
Muhammad arrived on a flight to New York on Monday under police
guard. ``He will remain in police custody as the investigation
continues, and will participate in police line-ups in front of the
victims,'' said Sgt. Andrew McInnis, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they expected to confer with prosecutors through the
night to determine charges.
</P>
<P>
   New York police detectives had been sent to Buffalo to bring
Muhammad back after the Customs agents examined the diary found in
his luggage, Murphy said. Based on a comparison of the diary notes
with unsolved crimes, Muhammad was said by police to be the prime
suspect in the murder of Paul Farrell, 47, a Hunter College
custodian and father of three who was stabbed and slashed to death
in Lincoln Terrace Park in Brooklyn the day after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials said the sword Muhammad was trying to spirit
into Canada appeared to be the weapon used to kill Farrell, and
that it and the two knives had been turned over to the New York
police.
</P>
<P>
   Police also confiscated notes and reading material that included
threats against Israel and the United States. But they said
Muhammad was not believed to be a terrorist and that his notes were
``just rantings,'' in the words of a Customs official.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials said they believed the name Naftali Triplett
was an alias, along with another name, Umar Ahmed, which appears on
a Pennsylvania driver's license Muhammad was also carrying.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Kelly, commissioner of the Customs Service, said the
border agents' searches led to a solid case against Muhammad. ``The
thoroughness of the Customs inspectors in going through the
suspect's materials was critical to his apprehension,'' he said in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after the robber made his leap from the building,
Police Commissioner Howard Safir was asked about the investigation
after a breakfast sponsored by the Citizens Crime Commission. The
early details were dramatic: the robber had landed on the 18th
floor air-conditioning unit of an adjacent building, climbed
through a window into a law office and sprinted for an elevator.

   During the car ride down, he robbed a sandwich deliveryman of an
apron, shirt and cap, and, so dressed, slipped into the crowd when
the elevator reached the ground floor.
</P>
<P>
   Safir cautioned reporters not to glamorize such an escape,
saying the robber was merely someone who jumped from a window when
cornered. The so-called Spider-Man, he said, is ``a common criminal
who happened to do something pretty stupid.''

ON PRO FOOTBALL: A STRANGE BUT EXCITING WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Subs 10th graf, And by the way ..., to CORRECT, Wilkins' punt
return was not a touchdown.) 
(bl)  
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There were many exhilarating and bizarre moments from the
National Football League division playoff weekend, and one happened
somewhere past midfield at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis, when
running back Eddie George was breaking his breathtaking 68-yard
touchdown run and, in turn, breaking the spirit of the Indianapolis
Colts.
</P>
<P>
   As George rumbled toward the end zone, he glanced up at the
giant replay screen to watch himself. A tiny smile broke across his
face, as in, ``Wow, I look pretty good.'' And he did, outrunning
three defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the TV cameras caught me checking out the replay
screen to see if anyone was catching up to me from behind,'' a
modest George said. ``I know I shouldn't have done that. I tried to
focus on just pumping my legs and not letting the turf monster trip
me up.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the more fascinating sights of the playoffs: a
broad-shouldered, 6-foot-3-inch, 240-pound runner, built like a
superhero but fast enough to set off a radar gun, outrunning
supposedly speedier Colts defensive backs, en route to one of the
biggest touchdowns in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie was worried someone was going to catch him, because if
he was caught, he would have never heard the end of it from us,''
said Tennessee receiver Yancey Thigpen. ``People don't realize it,
but once he gets going, he gets on a roll. When you see those
defensive backs chasing him for 60 yards and he outruns them that
says it all.''
</P>
<P>
   What a run. What a weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, a coach quits. In New York, a coach just says no. In
St. Louis, there was a track meet, while in Tampa Bay, it was a
game from the 1950s. Peyton Manning struggled, Steve McNair
excelled, Kurt Warner tossed five touchdowns and somebody named
Shaun King became the first rookie quarterback in 23 years to win a
playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   The weird, the spectacular, the ugly. It was all there.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans, the current incarnation of the old Houston Oilers,
won the franchise's first division playoff game since 1979. That's
good. Television cameras caught Minnesota wide receiver Randy Moss
squirting liquid from a container at an official who had made a
call Moss did not like. That's bad. Look for the star player to
receive a hefty fine from the league, and maybe an endorsement from
a bottled water company.
</P>
<P>
   And by the way, instant replay worked. Beautifully. It correctly
caught the Colts' Terrence Wilkins clearly stepping out of bounds
on an 87-yard punt return, bringing the ball back to the Colts'
33-yard line, instead of the Titans' 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very, very strange weekend,'' Thigpen said. ``You
watch some of the games and just sit back in disbelief.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Williams, the defensive coordinator for the Titans, said:
``I saw great plays. I saw wild games. I saw it all.''
</P>
<P>
   The strangeness led to two intriguing conference championship
games for Sunday. Tampa Bay may be the only team that can slow the
offensive juggernaut of the Rams. The Buccaneers have the speed and
depth on defense, especially when St. Louis goes to three and four
wide receivers. And defensive lineman Warren Sapp will surely be in
the face of Warner all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people may think that St. Louis will beat them
handily,'' said Tennessee coach Jeff Fisher. ``But with Tampa Bay's
defense, don't count on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville has lost only twice this season, both times to the
Titans. Perhaps the Jaguars see the Tennessee players in their
nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   It was Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson who endured a living
nightmare against the Jaguars on Saturday. Johnson was leaning
toward retiring from professional football anyway, but the
humiliating 62-7 loss to Jacksonville was a not-so-gentle shove. In
the end, Johnson's four-year tenure can only be viewed as
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   As a television analyst, it was Johnson who criticized Don
Shula, the former Dolphins coach, saying that Shula was failing to
take advantage of a Super Bowl-caliber team and organization.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson and Shula's records were almost identical. In
Shula's last four seasons, from 1992 to 1995, he was 39-25 with a
2-3 playoff record. Johnson, from 1996 to 1999, was 36-28, and also
had a 2-3 record in postseason play. But Shula never had an
embarrassing playoff loss like Johnson did Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances of Johnson's departure provide a stark
contrast to the status of St. Louis coach Dick Vermeil. While
Johnson leaves the game in embarrassing fashion, Vermeil, who last
season was on the verge of being fired, is so confident that he
says his team has no weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the RCA Dome. In one corner Colts running back Edgerrin
James, with a long face, tried to explain how he was held to only
2.8 yards a carry.
</P>
<P>
   A short walk down the hall, George was all smiles. He began to
daydream about the old days four years ago, when the Titans were
the Houston Oilers, and his rookie year, after the team returned
from a road game, there were two measly fans in the airport singing
the fight song.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `We have a long way to go,''' George said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Titans arrived at Nashville International Airport late
Saturday night, there were 8,000 fans cheering George and his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference. What a weekend.

BORDER ISSUES IMPEDE MIDEAST PEACE EFFORTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Israeli and Syrian leaders on Monday indefinitely
postponed their next round of talks, marking a setback to President
Clinton's efforts to broker a peace deal between the Middle Eastern
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Barak announced the delay in Jerusalem, two days before he was
planning to meet Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa for a
second set of negotiations in Shepherdstown, W.Va., this month.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came amid renewed terrorism in Israel and
opposition to ceding any of the Golan Heights, the strategic
plateau that Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it isn't comfortable for the Syrians to come now, and they
need some time, they should take the time,'' Barak said. ``We will
come when there are discussions, and the delay, if in fact it is
agreed on, does not bother us.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats reportedly telephoned Barak and al-Sharaa in an
effort to persuade them to keep the talks on track. The Israeli and
the Syrian agreed to send subordinates to Washington to discuss
relatively minor issues.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, before the postponement was announced,
Clinton expressed cautious optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is, I'm convinced they both still want to do
it,'' Clinton said of Barak and al-Sharaa. ``And they're not as far
apart as they might be, not as far apart as they have been. So
that's the good news.''
</P>
<P>
   Their major sticking point seemed to be the disposition of the
Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Israeli press published a U.S.-prepared ``working
document'' expressing Israel's and Syria's negotiating positions.
It states that Israel wants security guarantees from Syria before
beginning any discussion of a withdrawal from the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, the document says, wants Israel to agree to return the
land all the way to the Sea of Galilee, a source of water for
Israel, before the talks progress to other issues.
</P>
<P>
   The document also reportedly includes Syrian concessions to
discuss security and political ties, but it does not include an
Israeli commitment to discuss Syria's border demands, causing the
Syrian negotiators considerable embarrassment at home.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts in Israel said they suspect that the Syrians have been
fuming since the document's publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Syrians are saying, `We gave in during the previous round
of negotiations. Now we want to get back to the issue of borders,'
'' said Reuven Hazan, a political analyst at Jerusalem's Hebrew
University.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls in Israel suggest that a majority believe that
peace with Syria will mean giving up the Golan Heights. Barak,
however, has refused to say whether, or how much, of the territory
he is willing to relinquish.
</P>
<P>
   The ``working document'' included demands by the Israeli side
that the Golan settlers remain there after a peace deal is reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak won't give it to them, and it actually looks good for
him,'' said Hazan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nobody on the left-wing saying, `Oh just give the
Syrians what they want,' '' he said. ``Because Barak is acting
powerfully, those on the right aren't able to criticize him.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's chief rabbis indirectly challenged Barak on Monday when
they proclaimed that the Golan Heights is part of the biblical land
of Israel. The influential Chief Rabbinical Council, however, did
not say that Jewish law prohibits Israel from returning the land
for peace.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling could make it more difficult for Barak to sell any
peace agreement with Syria that includes giving up the Golan
Heights. The rabbis' position could convince many of the country's
politically powerful, conservative Orthodox Jews, who make up 25
percent the population, to oppose any surrender of the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
   In the Israeli coastal town of Hadera, a small bomb hidden in a
garbage can exploded, injuring 21 people. Israeli police said they
suspected Islamic extremists carried out the attack to derail the
peace process. But Hamas, a Palestinian organization responsible
for past bombings, denied involvement in the blast. Instead, a
small group in Lebanon called Omar Mukhtar claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said that Israel was ``determined to act with all its
might to crush terrorism,'' but he did not threaten to halt the
peace talks with the Syrians or the separate track with the
Palestinians. A similar bombing occurred in the nearby town of
Netanya in November, wounding 33 people.

EDITORIAL: GIFT GAMES IN ALBANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Jan. 18:
</P>
<P>
   Curiously missing from Gov. George Pataki's recent State of the
State Message were any proposals to elevate New York's dismal
standards of government ethics. The governor may be under the
impression that he fulfilled his duty on ethics when he consummated
a deal with the state Legislature late last month to renew the
state's expiring lobbying law.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that deal, concocted behind closed doors as New Yorkers were
distracted by the holidays, was an act of bipartisan cynicism. Its
purpose was to leave undisturbed the discredited system of
legalized bribery that permits lawmakers to accept fancy meals,
choice sports tickets and other personal financial favors from
lobbyists seeking to gain influence over public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki is not alone to blame for this travesty. The Assembly
speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, has also been unmoved and
unchastened by the current lobbying scandal involving widespread
legislative gift-giving by Philip Morris, the tobacco giant. Over
the objection of a small group of reformers led by Assemblyman
Alexander Grannis of Manhattan, Silver refused to go along with a
gift ban after the Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, a
Republican, had boldly persuaded his chamber to pass a bill that
included several useful restrictions on gifts. Silver wanted to
keep the Knicks and Rangers tickets flowing, so Pataki dropped his
support for gift reform in exchange for Silver's agreement to drop
another reform that Pataki did not like. The net result was a
halfhearted ethics overhaul that strengthened and expanded the
reach of the state's disclosure rules but did not fundamentally
threaten Albany's pervasive culture of influence-peddling.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's recent decision to decline most gifts from
lobbyists voluntarily is praiseworthy, but no substitute for
mandatory curbs. Meanwhile, Silver has sought to divert attention
from his role in this mess by reviving some old if worthy proposals
for campaign finance reform. It will not work. Gift-giving in the
Legislature is a festering scandal that Silver, the governor and
members of the Legislature must promptly address.  &QL;

<P>
   In March, when six Libyan officials were tried in Paris for
ordering the bombing of a French plane a decade earlier, the
evidence against them included a Samsonite suitcase armed with
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, a deposition sworn in Mexico described a scene
in which cocaine traffickers transported $60 million in bribe money
in Samsonite luggage.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few months ago, Samsonite _ the favorite suitcase for
much of the world _ was more likely to be named in court documents
about international miscreants than in the pages of international
fashion magazines.
</P>
<P>
   But the arrival of the British designer Neil Barrett, 34, at the
company about a year ago has done much to refurbish Samsonite's
image as something other than a maker of drab luggage for
Floridians over 63, along with the occasional felon.
</P>
<P>
   The suitcase purveyor has gained such cachet that last week
Francois Pinault, the French financier bent on assembling a
luxury-goods empire, became Samsonite's largest shareholder,
acquiring 30 percent through a holding company.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett introduced his first travel wear for the company early
last year. It has brought Samsonite $10 million in sales, said
Beppi Fremder, president of Samsonite in Italy, the division of the
company responsible for fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The clothes _ for men, women and children _ are meant to perform
sleight of hand. One jacket adjusts to the wearer's body
temperature, so that the wearer would theoretically be as
comfortable in it in Cleveland as in Phoenix. Other jackets have
travel pillows or reading lamps that pop out of the collars.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, a hiking coat comes with a walking stick
incongruously attached (in case the hiker falls down and is
injured), along with a flask inside a pocket (in case he wants to
numb the pain with some Maker's Mark). Some pants have zip-off legs
to turn them into shorts.
</P>
<P>
   The clothes perform almost every subsidiary function short of
turning into cappuccino makers, and the style seems to be
influencing others. When Naoki Takizawa showed his Issey Miyake
menswear collection in Milan this month, he showed sweaters that
had hoods and capes stealthily tucked into them, and jackets with
all sorts of gadget holders.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett's first collection, for fall 1999, was picked up by
Louis Boston, Saks Fifth Avenue and Jeffrey in New York. Jeffrey
Kalinsky, owner of Jeffrey, said that Samsonite clothes have sold
better than anything else in his store. ``We didn't have a piece to
mark down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers like Fred Segal in Los Angeles, Neiman Marcus and
Bergdorf Goodman are carrying the line for spring. ``It's kind of
gimmicky,'' James Aguiar, Bergdorf's fashion director,
acknowledged. ``But it's gimmicky without being stupid.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Barrett's pedigree as a designer is akin to that of a banker who
has hurdled Harvard, Stanford Business School and Goldman, Sachs.
He studied at Central St. Martin's College of Art and Design in
London and then earned a master's degree at the Royal College of
Art before landing jobs at Gucci and Prada.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s he wrote Prada's chief executive, Patrizio
Bertelli, suggesting the company start a menswear division and
offering his services. Months went by, but Barrett was eventually
granted a brief meeting with Bertelli (``he flips through your work
so quickly,'' Barrett said) and was unexpectedly offered the job of
overseeing menswear design, which he held until 1998.
</P>
<P>
   His training at Gucci and Prada gave him, he said, ``a vision of
reality.'' He designs his Samsonite line aboard planes and trains
between London, Milan and Florence. The idea for his jacket cum
reading lamp was born when he was in the passenger seat of a car,
trying to do some work. The interior light didn't switch on. ``In
the car is when you want to make your phone calls,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Samsonite line, Barrett is making a name for
himself with his own menswear, also functional. He started, he
said, because ``I particularly dislike feminine clothes for men,''
a style that has dominated on the runways.
</P>
<P>
   When he offered his first collection last year, 100 stores
worldwide chose to carry it. Last week in Florence, Italy, he
showed his first signature line on a runway, with unfussy looks for
women, too, including conservative leather skirts and jackets.
</P>
<P>
   There were 1,000 people in the audience. After a few days of
watching men parade down some Milan runways in skirts, they no
doubt were relieved to be there.

 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
This past weekend, the NFC's No. 1 defense shut down the NFL's
second-best offense. Now, that defense will be facing the very
best.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay Buccaneers, whose defense was ranked third in the
league in 1999, edged Washington 14-13 on Saturday. The victory
earned them an NFC Championship Game trip to St. Louis, where
they'll take on the explosive Rams, who waxed Minnesota on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tampa Bay has a great defense, so I don't think it will be a
circus act like it was today,'' Vikings linebacker Dwayne Rudd said
after his team's 49-37 loss. ``St. Louis may have a hard time with
(Tampa's) front four. But the thing about St. Louis is they score
points. I don't know if Tampa Bay will be able to score with St.
Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers probably aren't going to score 37 points like the
Vikings did. More important, they're not going to score 50, which
is what it would have taken Sunday to beat St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not,'' Bucs coach Tony Dungy said, ``win an 80-point
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs, who have held eight opponents to 10 or fewer points,
figure the only way to contain St. Louis will be to force mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to create turnovers, get sacks and stop the running
game,'' Bucs defensive end Steve White said. ``That's the nature of
our team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams did not play mistake-free football Sunday; they simply
overcame their miscues. Quarterback Kurt Warner threw an
interception and lost a fumble in the first half, with the Vikings
eventually scoring off both gifts. Not that it mattered.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams scored in a variety of ways Sunday. There was a 77-yard
scoring strike from Warner to Isaac Bruce on St. Louis' first play.
There was a screen to Marshall Faulk, who cut inside and covered 41
yards to the goal line. There was a 95-yard kickoff return by Tony
Horne to open the second half, followed by four more touchdown
drives, three that ended with catches by different players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done that all year long, trying to make them (opponents)
cover everybody,'' Warner said. ``You can't do it all game.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams in the NFC title game will be led by first-year
starting quarterbacks. Warner proved he deserved his Most Valuable
Player trophy with his five-touchdown performance against
Minnesota. But Bucs rookie quarterback Shaun King, who took over in
the 11th week of the season, has been another good story.
</P>
<P>
   King led his team to a 5-1 mark down the stretch, engineering
four second-half comebacks en route to the playoffs. He did it
again Saturday after the Bucs found themselves trailing 13-0 in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw an NFL quarterback,'' Redskins cornerback Darrell Green
said after the game. ``I didn't see a rookie.''
</P>
<P>
   Though some of these players were mere infants at the time, the
city of Tampa would like to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the
last Bucs-Rams NFC Championship Game by reversing the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Rams won that game, stealing it from the Bucs
9-0 in Tampa. Until now, neither team had made it this far since.
</P>
<P>
   ``People really tend to believe in the NFC that you've got to
score a lot of points to win,'' White said. ``We think if you've
got a great defense, a good running attack and make plays in the
passing game when you can, you'll win the majority of your games.
So far, we have. And we're going to keep the same game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   But the high-powered Rams, who averaged 400.8 yards per game in
the regular season, will certainly be the toughest test thus far
for the Bucs, who gave up an average of 267.5 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring on the best to play the best,'' Tampa Bay defensive
tackle Warren Sapp said. ``If you want to go to the Super Bowl _
the greatest show on earth _ then you've got to figure on going
through the biggest challenge. Washington was the second-best
offense, and the only touchdown they scored was on a kickoff
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that St. Louis' offense has been the big story all
year. Maybe it figures our defense meets them at center stage.''
</P>
<P>
   The big question now is whether that defense will remain
standing for an encore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Warner said. ``I haven't seen a defense
that has done it yet. People are going to have to prove it to me
for me to believe it.''

   PARIS _ It is not by chance that high fashion causes mere
mortals to grin with fright. Here is John Galliano, the chief
designer of Dior, in his studio explaining how his spring haute
couture collection was inspired by the tramp balls that aristocrats
used to throw for themselves in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Galliano has on a drab knit cap, and he is pointing to some old
photographs of French tramps, saying how the swells of Paris were
so taken with this naive style that they'd even go to their
hairdressers to get those elaborate bum hairdos.
</P>
<P>
   All very true. Yet go into one of the English bookstores here
and try to find a reference to the subject, even from a writer as
well known as Janet Flanner, and the young saleswoman will give you
a fey-bored look and say, ``Is that with one `n' or two?''
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't have a clue about the practice of socialites'
wrapping themselves up like mackerels in newspaper and running
around in the din of Paris, and what is more, she doesn't care. For
high fashion to have meaning, it must have roots, yet they can't be
so twisted or obscure as to have absolutely no connection to the
present.
</P>
<P>
   That's been the trouble with the spring 2000 couture shows, now
in their third day. Designers have been too besotted with the past,
and worse still with their own past, as Valentino was on Sunday
when he trawled back over 40 years of jet-set glamour, right down
to the blue eye shadow and petrified-looking hairdos that recalled
Baby Jane Holzer, circa 1963.
</P>
<P>
   So there have been too many spooks and not enough ghost busters.
The one brilliant exception was Jean Paul Gaultier. His collection
on Sunday, in the grand house in the Passy section that once
belonged to Marie-Laure de Noailles, who knew Cocteau, Dali,
Picasso _ well, practically everyone who mattered in Paris before
and after World War II _ combined Parisian elegance with Indian
beauty.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting that he chose a house with so many associations
to the life of Paris in the 20th century. Yet he laid down an
Indian orange carpet scattered with flowers, and he covered the
chandeliers with gauze because, as he said, ``It's important to
remember that while I love the past, I am not from that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaultier did some ingenious things, like mixing old fabrics with
current materials like python and choosing pale shades of lavender
and green that looked as if they had been faded in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   The show opened with his saucy version of the trench-coat dress,
now opened in the back, followed by sharply cut navy or
cream-colored jackets over soft skirts or pants. A cream
double-breasted jacket, its sleeves pushed up to reveal a smoky
brown chiffon blouse, closed tightly over a pleated green polka-dot
skirt, with sheer yellow leggings underneath.
</P>
<P>
   There were crisp white shirts with slim, nude skirts embroidered
in orange and gold, and a vest made of mother-of-pearl paillettes,
and worn with a long slinky gray skirt and a pale lilac chiffon
blouse.
</P>
<P>
   The models wore simple turbans, usually in bright colors, and
there was no music, only a female voice calling out the number and
name of each style: ``Baroda,'' ``Tea Time,'' ``Indian Gypsy.''
</P>
<P>
   The clothes were light and free of gimmicks, and here and there
were touches of Gaultier's familiar wit: a parade float of a ball
gown made from densely packed tulle in a jungle camouflage pattern
and a pair of jeans embroidered from the pockets down in clear
crystals to look destroyed. Every bit of fraying was encrusted with
beads, taking the idea of couture jeans _ indeed, couture itself _
to a different level.
</P>
<P>
   This was Gaultier's strongest collection since he took on haute
couture a couple of years ago, and it's no wonder he is attracting
the interest of more established couture clients like Mouna Ayoub
and Deeda Blair. ``For me, the only reason to do couture is to
dress women, not to make something abstract,'' he said. His
business has grown from six clients to more than 35, and he now
employs 40 people in his atelier.
</P>
<P>
   As for Galliano's down-and-out collection of oversize tramp
pants and urchin skirts artfully printed with the fashion pages of
The International Herald Tribune _ which made the newspaper's
fashion editor, Suzy Menkes, beam in the front row _ the English
designer continued with the deconstructed theme of his last couture
and ready-to-wear shows.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, the ideas came together more convincingly.
Or maybe Galliano's impudence is growing on his audience.
</P>
<P>
   With Madonna's new version of ``American Pie'' in the
background, he sent out frayed beauties with Charlie Chaplin eyes
and hobo trinkets (including airline-size bottles of Scotch)
dangling from their waists.
</P>
<P>
   The clothes _ those impeccably tailored Dior jackets in light
gray, those signature underpinnings _ were twisted back to front
and inside out, so the labels and linings were all exposed. It was
much as if some poor Doolittle of the streets had nosed through the
duke of Windsor's waste bin and decked himself out like a gent.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's hard to imagine a couture client shelling out
$25,000 for a dress just so she can look like a bum. But as
Galliano admitted in his studio a few days before the show, ``I'm
not all that interested in the old Dior clients.'' What Galliano is
really attempting to do by showing clothes in such a seemingly
deranged manner is to deconstruct the myth of Dior. The question is
whether his approach has enough followers.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Donatella Versace sent out a simple but solid
collection of ultra-sexy evening looks in those vibrant hues of
pink and turquoise that little girls seem to love the moment they
first set eyes on Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   It was a skin-on-skin collection, with snake and suede worked
close to the body. Organdy was pieced together in swirls of black
and pale green, while a black snake town coat looked demure enough
from the front, but in the back was cut out in flower petals on
tulle.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Ungaro's inspiration was Rimbaud, and while that
immediately suggests something tortured, the clothes were light and
beautiful _ loose-fitting jackets embroidered with discreet (for
Ungaro) touches of stones, and intensely colored skirts of chiffon
graduating toward the hem in smokier hues.
</P>
<P>
   Valentino's retrospective collection, as someone said, left
nothing but an old impression _ which was uncharacteristic of him,
given that his last two couture collections were right on the
money.
</P>
<P>
   In a season elevated by Gaultier's light hand and the
consideration he so obviously gives to making an old tradition say
something new, Alexander McQueen's collection for Givenchy seemed
like heavy weather.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there were great moments, like a glacier-white coat plucked
with tiny feathers and a precisely cut gray coat over a silvery
dress with a gently draped neckline. But many of the hard-edged
shapes looked too familiar, advancing little, and McQueen's thick
coating of white feathers on an otherwise simple suit looked
morbid, as if a vulture had taken roost.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of spooks, McQueen opened his show with a model
wearing only a pair of men's underpants _ presumably meant to have
belonged to her departed mate _ and being slowly dressed from a
steamer trunk by an elderly valet in tails who bore an uncanny
resemblance to Hubert de Givenchy.

A HOMAGE THAT COMES WITH PERILS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For many weeks, two New York men with devoted
followings warned Hillary Rodham Clinton that unless she came to
them and made obeisance, her chances of going to the U.S. Senate
were about as good as John Rocker's becoming the next commissioner
of immigration. Now, in the span of six days, Mrs. Clinton has
dutifully paid homage to both.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, David Letterman and the Rev. Al Sharpton
would seem to have little in common, other than that both possess
quick minds and keen senses of humor. As of Monday, both could also
boast that they had exacted a command performance from the first
lady.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is obvious. Did she do herself any good with
the New Yorkers who really count? We're talking, of course, about
the voters.
</P>
<P>
   To dispense with the easy one first, Mrs. Clinton's chirpy
appearance on the Letterman show last week seems to have been a
plus for her, except possibly among people not thrilled to have our
political discourse shaped by stand-up comics, or maybe among women
unhappy that she would respond to the finger snaps of a couple of
influential men.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's pilgrimage Monday to Sharpton's Harlem
headquarters is, to put it mildly, a bit more problematic.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Mrs. Clinton went to the National Action Network to
deliver a tribute to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on the
holiday bearing his name. In that spirit, she spoke vigorously,
even passionately, about the need for racial reconciliation and how
``Dr. King's unfinished business is our unfinished business.''
</P>
<P>
   You may assume it was a gloved jab at her probable opponent for
senator, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, when she remarked that ``if I am
given the privilege of representing the people of New York, I want
to be defined as someone who unites, not divides.'' Or when she
said that homeless families need to ``get help, not scapegoating.''
She never mentioned the mayor by name. But then, she didn't have
to.
</P>
<P>
   The important thing was not what she said but that she was there
at all, standing next to the man who remains as radioactive for
many New Yorkers as he was the day he burst into their
consciousness helping Tawana Brawley spread her tall tales. ``Mrs.
Clinton will be attacked for coming,'' Sharpton acknowledged,
although, as City Councilman Bill Perkins of Harlem said later, the
heaviest attacks will probably come from those who were not going
to vote for her anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The sense was that Monday was not really about Mrs. Clinton, or
even about King. It was about Al Sharpton and the degree to which
he has rehabilitated himself among mainstream Democrats. There was
no shortage of them trooping across his stage, including two former
mayors, a U.S. senator, two congressmen, the city's public advocate
and a chorus of state senators and Assembly members.
</P>
<P>
   As he often does, Sharpton cast himself as a latter-day
incarnation of King. Some civil rights figures in the city dismiss
this as a laughable claim from a racial arsonist. Yet it is
impossible to ignore how far Sharpton has come in reinventing
himself. One or two speakers Monday even referred to him as the
Rev. Doctor Sharpton. Get it?
</P>
<P>
   There was a good deal of hypothesizing, from Sharpton and
others, about what King would have done were he alive today.
</P>
<P>
   It is indeed easy to imagine him leading Sharpton-style protests
against police tactics or Giuliani's homeless policies. Other parts
of Sharpton's past were not mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   But it is tough to discern King's guiding spirit in the Brawley
affair, or when Sharpton referred to businessmen on 125th Street as
``white interlopers,'' or when he shared a stage with serial
purveyors of anti-Semitic rants like Louis Farrakhan and Khallid
Abdul Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
   Those who continue to harbor doubts were not likely to have been
reassured Monday by the odd way in which the Rev. Charles Norris, a
Queens minister, introduced Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   Norris told a story about how he himself had once been fired by
two men named Miller. They were Jews, Norris felt obliged to point
out. ``We knew that!'' a woman called out from the audience. Norris
added that he was ``employed by another Jew, by the name of
Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was not yet in the auditorium, and she said later
that she had not heard the discordant reference to Jews, which she
denounced.
</P>
<P>
   Call it a minor episode. But it was a reminder of the political
perils when you make a pilgrimage to someone who has a way to go
before reaching full rehabilitation.

BRADLEY AND GORE ENGAGE IN A SHARP EXCHANGE ON RACIAL PROFILING
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: INSERTS new 9th graf, Gore did not respond ..., to add

<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Hoping to stir doubts about the
administration's commitment to minorities, former Sen. Bill Bradley
on Monday night challenged Vice President Al Gore to press
President Clinton to issue an executive order banning racial
profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Gore fired back with a forceful defense of the president in a
brief but sharp confrontation between the two Democratic
presidential candidates as they appeared in their sixth _ and final
_ debate before the first votes are cast in the Iowa caucuses next
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley seized the offensive at a debate at a high school here
sponsored by the Iowa Brown-Black Presidential Forum, a group that
promotes black and Latino issues, after Gore pledged to sign an
executive order banning profiling, the practice of singling out
blacks for police questioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, Al, I know that you would issue an order to end
racial profiling if you were president of the United States,''
Bradley said. ``But we have a president now. You serve with him. I
want you to walk down that hallway, walk into his office, and say,
`Sign this executive order today.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gore jumped to the president's defense, asserting, ``I don't
think President Bill Clinton needs a lecture from Bill Bradley
about how to stand up and fight for African-Americans and Latinos
in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice rising, Gore went on, ``It's one thing to talk the
talk. It's another thing to walk the walk, whether it's down the
hallway.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's comments elicited boos and jeers from the
audience of several hundred, which was stocked with supporters of
Bradley, who is lagging far behind Gore in the polls in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange over racial profiling made for the most tense
moments of the 60-minute televised forum. Most of the time, Bradley
and Gore put forth virtually identical positions. In fact, even
though minorities make up a tiny portion of the Iowa electorate,
they devoted themselves to trying to top one another in responding
to questions about who they would put on the Supreme Court, their
outrage at the Confederate flag that flies over the capitol of
South Carolina and their efforts to reach out to the Rev. Al
Sharpton, the New York civil rights leader.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not respond directly to a question about whether he
would agree to Sharpton's request that they meet publicly, saying
he had already met with him in a larger group. Bradley said he had
visited Sharpton's church in Harlem and added, ``I don't agree with
Al Sharpton on everything, but I think that he's got to be given
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, Gore reminded the audience that Monday was the
holiday honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. And invoking
King's memory, he pointed out that he had spoken Monday at the
Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta at the invitation of King's
widow, Coretta Scott King.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley sought to strike a chord with minorities by recalling
something he rarely discusses in public: his self-described role as
a conciliator between white and black players when he was a forward
for the New York Knicks. The subject came up when he was asked
about John Rocker, a pitcher for the Atlanta Braves who had made
disparaging remarks about blacks, immigrants and gays.
</P>
<P>
   He put it this way: ``When I was on the Knicks, one of my jobs
was when there was a white player that came on the team, who didn't
quite understand, used the wrong words, I took him over to the side
and said, `Look, that doesn't work on this team. If you want to be
on this team, you respect everybody.' If that had happened on the
Atlanta Braves, you wouldn't have had John Rocker.''
</P>
<P>
   In appealing to minorities, Bradley sought to close a gap in
what appears to be Gore's overwhelming edge in support from black
voters. Clinton is enormously popular with black voters, many of
whom are loyal to Gore because of his service in the Clinton White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Given the president's popularity among blacks, Bradley's
scolding of Clinton on Monday night was something of a risk. It was
also curious given that at forum honoring King at Drake University
here on Monday morning, Bradley praised the president's racial
policies in response to an audience question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're different people,'' he said of Clinton, ``but we have a
common commitment on race.''
</P>
<P>
   But among the broader electorate, Clinton is not as popular. By
invoking the Clinton-Gore connection, Bradley reminded voters of
what they may not like about the administration _ and implicitly
presented himself as a fresh face.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals Monday night were probably aimed as much at liberal
voters as at minorities. That is certainly the case here in Iowa,
which is 96.7 percent white and has among the lowest percentages of
minorities of any state. Blacks account for roughly 1.7 percent of
the population; Latinos make up 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley also reached out to minorities in response to a
question about the high percentage of blacks in prison. Both
candidates said they would consider reviewing the prohibition that
bars felons from voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the definition of what kind of crimes
automatically fall in the category that triggers that exclusion
from the franchise could well benefit from a fresh review,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley put it this way: ``If someone is on a nonviolent offense
and comes out and is able to go straight for two years, I think
that that person ought to be able to wipe his record clean and
start the day anew.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Republican candidates who were reluctant to
attack South Carolina residents for hoisting a Confederate flag,
Gore and Bradley said it was a hurtful symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only the Republican candidates for president who are so
scared of the extreme right that they will be tolerant of
intolerance lest they offend the offensive,'' Gore declared. ``It
ought to come down.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said: ``I don't want this to be a symbol of America in
any way whatsoever. That's why it ought to come down.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even after the debate, the one-upmanship continued as both
contenders trotted out some of their best-known black and Hispanic
supporters to stand before reporters and tout their candidates'
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Gore brought along three minority cabinet members: Alexis
Herman, the labor secretary, and Rodney Slater, the transportation
secretary, who are both black, and Bill Richardson, the energy
secretary, who is Hispanic. During the debate, Gore also mentioned
two politicians from Bradley's home state of New Jersey who have
criticized of Bradley: Mayor Sharpe James of Newark, who is black,
and Rep. Robert Menendez of Union City, who is of Cuban descent.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, in turn, brought along Rep. Luis Guttierrez of Chicago
and state Rep. Maria Escutia from Los Angeles, both Hispanic. And
after the debate, Bradley also made an unannounced foray into the
press room with Bill Russell, the former Boston Celtic star, and
Cornell West, the Harvard professor who is his constant companion
at debates.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although the event Monday night marked the last time Gore and
Bradley will share a stage before the Iowa caucuses, both
contenders _ and their loyalists _ will be engaged in a frenzy of
stumping over the next six days. But it will be complicated by the
fact that the two are also spending time in New Hampshire, where
they are locked in a tighter race. The primary there is Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   With Gore well ahead in every poll of expected caucuses-goers,
the question among politicians in this state is not whether he will
win but by what margin. Polls show he is pulling more than 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the vice president still maintains his lead, Bill Bradley's
going to have a hard time breaking the 35 percent barrier,'' Rob
Tully, the chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party, said in an
interview. ``What the Bradley campaign has done over the last week
is to lower the expectations.''

IT'S CALLED SMUGGLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY PAT FLANNERY AND DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - Smugglers will do anything, use anyone, to get drugs
into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   They stitch cash into a cadaver and drive across the border.
</P>
<P>
   They hide a load of marijuana under the seat of a car and place
a sick old man on top, his intravenous drip by his side.
</P>
<P>
   They hide drugs on their own kids, or hire poor children off the
streets. Kids, they rationalize, won't be punished much if they're
caught. &QL; 
THE TACTICS
</P>
<P>
   They buy hair spray, empty the cans and stuff drugs inside, or
they cut open boxes of Tide, empty most of the detergent and
replace it with drug cash to send south.
</P>
<P>
   They hollow out car doors, the backs of seats and the insides of
cushions. They hide pot in removable dashboards, in false pickup
truck beds and fake fenders, in tires, around motors and over
transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   They buy a new Nissan Sentra and weld vacuum-sealed metal
containers, each containing 14 pounds of cocaine, to wheel rims.
They buy a used Ford Explorer, weld a small fuel container inside
the gas tank, then jam the rest of the tank with 50 pounds of
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   They build false ceilings into tractor-trailers, false walls
into railroad cars and false floors into airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   They fly bales of marijuana over the desert and kick them out to
allies waiting below.
</P>
<P>
   They tunnel under the border and into U.S. homes, hoisting
bundles of cocaine to allies waiting above.
</P>
<P>
   Even their own bodies are not sacred.
</P>
<P>
   Hikers strap 30- to 50-pound bales to their backs and navigate
perilous desert and mountain trails into Arizona. They conceal
their tracks every way possible, crossing dirt border roads on
planks _ even pole vaulting across.
</P>
<P>
   They hide everything from heroin to anabolic steroids in the
hollowed heels of running shoes. They stuff balloons of cocaine
into every human orifice _ or swallow them, and hope they pass
through their bodies before the balloons burst.
</P>
<P>
   They tape cash to their torsos and cocaine to their crotches.
</P>
<P>
   One man rolled an old tire across the Naco border road and let
it flop to the ground in a dusty American trailer court. A Border
Patrol agent checking it out could hardly lift the tire. It was
stuffed with drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the tire roller, most smugglers are using
increasingly sophisticated ways to send hot cargoes over the line,
said Jesus Cruz, chief Customs inspector at Nogales' commercial
port.
</P>
<P>
   And with the increase in border traffic spurred by the North
American Free Trade Agreement, ``they're even using (legitimate)
cargo to hide drugs,'' Cruz said. &QL; 
THE HIDING SPOT
</P>
<P>
   Last year, inspectors were suspicious of two tractor diesel
engines headed to Michigan for refurbishing. Disassembling the
motors, they found the pistons and oil pans missing. Packed tight
in their place: a load of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of creativity is no longer unusual. Inspectors found
electrical transformers headed to Fargo, N.D., gutted and refilled
with cocaine. On one memorable occasion, Nogales inspectors drilled
into a northbound lumber load and found the timber had been
hollowed and stuffed with more than 1,000 pounds of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Customs Inspector Peter Bachelier, an expert on rail smuggling,
said traffickers have been known to bury narcotics in the bottoms
of U.S.-bound hopper cars loaded with commodities. They've hidden
loads in or on brand new Ford Escorts being delivered by rail from
Hermosillo to Arizona. Now, every train and its cargo are searched
at the border.
</P>
<P>
   Yuma police Lt. Doug Lee said it's impossible to profile
smugglers because their tactics are so varied.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, they use old junkers and sometimes brand new cars to
drive drugs across the border. The drivers usually know very little
about who the drugs came from or where they're going. The system
keeps Mexican sources and U.S. warehouses from being discovered if
the drugs are busted en route, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Often, a small load is sent across the border near a big load,
with smugglers using it to distract inspectors. &QL; 
THE DECOY
</P>
<P>
   On a cool evening last February, Douglas Customs Inspector Jim
Power had his dog named Once sniffing for dope haulers.
</P>
<P>
   Cars in seven lanes were backed up into Agua Prieta, spewing
fumes. It was quiet until a young Hispanic suddenly leaped from a
beat-up Mazda near the inspection booth and took off running south.
</P>
<P>
   Uniformed men and women swarmed the car, tapping it with density
meters, looking underneath with mirrors, reaching behinds seats.
</P>
<P>
   They rolled the Mazda aside for a more thorough check as Once
moved in, tail wagging. The dog went nuts around the left front
bumper, scratching and whining.
</P>
<P>
   The hood popped open and a single brick of marijuana rested in
plain view behind the headlight. Instead of celebrating, one of the
inspectors shouted, ``It's a decoy. Stop the lines! Close it
down!''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, scores of cars were backed up and dogs were
running up and down the lines.

IT'S CALLED SMUGGLING 
</HEADLINE>

   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - Smugglers will do anything, use anyone, to get drugs
into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   They stitch cash into a cadaver and drive across the border.
</P>
<P>
   They hide a load of marijuana under the seat of a car and place
a sick old man on top, his intravenous drip by his side.
</P>
<P>
   They hide drugs on their own kids, or hire poor children off the
streets. Kids, they rationalize, won't be punished much if they're
caught. &QL; 
THE TACTICS
</P>
<P>
   They buy hair spray, empty the cans and stuff drugs inside, or
they cut open boxes of Tide, empty most of the detergent and
replace it with drug cash to send south.
</P>
<P>
   They hollow out car doors, the backs of seats and the insides of
cushions. They hide pot in removable dashboards, in false pickup
truck beds and fake fenders, in tires, around motors and over
transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   They buy a new Nissan Sentra and weld vacuum-sealed metal
containers, each containing 14 pounds of cocaine, to wheel rims.
They buy a used Ford Explorer, weld a small fuel container inside
the gas tank, then jam the rest of the tank with 50 pounds of
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   They build false ceilings into tractor-trailers, false walls
into railroad cars and false floors into airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   They fly bales of marijuana over the desert and kick them out to
allies waiting below.
</P>
<P>
   They tunnel under the border and into U.S. homes, hoisting
bundles of cocaine to allies waiting above.
</P>
<P>
   Even their own bodies are not sacred.
</P>
<P>
   Hikers strap 30- to 50-pound bales to their backs and navigate
perilous desert and mountain trails into Arizona. They conceal
their tracks every way possible, crossing dirt border roads on
planks _ even pole vaulting across.
</P>
<P>
   They hide everything from heroin to anabolic steroids in the
hollowed heels of running shoes. They stuff balloons of cocaine
into every human orifice _ or swallow them, and hope they pass
through their bodies before the balloons burst.
</P>
<P>
   They tape cash to their torsos and cocaine to their crotches.
</P>
<P>
   One man rolled an old tire across the Naco border road and let
it flop to the ground in a dusty American trailer court. A Border
Patrol agent checking it out could hardly lift the tire. It was
stuffed with drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the tire roller, most smugglers are using
increasingly sophisticated ways to send hot cargoes over the line,
said Jesus Cruz, chief Customs inspector at Nogales' commercial
port.
</P>
<P>
   And with the increase in border traffic spurred by the North
American Free Trade Agreement, ``they're even using (legitimate)
cargo to hide drugs,'' Cruz said. &QL; 
THE HIDING SPOT
</P>
<P>
   Last year, inspectors were suspicious of two tractor diesel
engines headed to Michigan for refurbishing. Disassembling the
motors, they found the pistons and oil pans missing. Packed tight
in their place: a load of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of creativity is no longer unusual. Inspectors found
electrical transformers headed to Fargo, N.D., gutted and refilled
with cocaine. On one memorable occasion, Nogales inspectors drilled
into a northbound lumber load and found the timber had been
hollowed and stuffed with more than 1,000 pounds of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Customs Inspector Peter Bachelier, an expert on rail smuggling,
said traffickers have been known to bury narcotics in the bottoms
of U.S.-bound hopper cars loaded with commodities. They've hidden
loads in or on brand new Ford Escorts being delivered by rail from
Hermosillo to Arizona. Now, every train and its cargo are searched
at the border.
</P>
<P>
   Yuma police Lt. Doug Lee said it's impossible to profile
smugglers because their tactics are so varied.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, they use old junkers and sometimes brand new cars to
drive drugs across the border. The drivers usually know very little
about who the drugs came from or where they're going. The system
keeps Mexican sources and U.S. warehouses from being discovered if
the drugs are busted en route, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Often, a small load is sent across the border near a big load,
with smugglers using it to distract inspectors. &QL; 
THE DECOY
</P>
<P>
   On a cool evening last February, Douglas Customs Inspector Jim
Power had his dog named Once sniffing for dope haulers.
</P>
<P>
   Cars in seven lanes were backed up into Agua Prieta, spewing
fumes. It was quiet until a young Hispanic suddenly leaped from a
beat-up Mazda near the inspection booth and took off running south.
</P>
<P>
   Uniformed men and women swarmed the car, tapping it with density
meters, looking underneath with mirrors, reaching behinds seats.
</P>
<P>
   They rolled the Mazda aside for a more thorough check as Once
moved in, tail wagging. The dog went nuts around the left front
bumper, scratching and whining.
</P>
<P>
   The hood popped open and a single brick of marijuana rested in
plain view behind the headlight. Instead of celebrating, one of the
inspectors shouted, ``It's a decoy. Stop the lines! Close it
down!''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, scores of cars were backed up and dogs were
running up and down the lines.
</P>
<P>
   Inspector Clarissa Velasco used a fiber-optic medical scope to
peer inside the Mazda's gas tank. Others combed the sedan's
interior, finding only a beer can and a key, still in the ignition.
That was another tip-off: Most people have a bunch of keys on their
chain.
</P>
<P>
   A second brick of pot was in the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a throwaway,'' Velasco said. ``I'll betcha a big load
of coke went in right ahead of this, and we lost it.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone nodded. The Mazda and cannabis were sacrificed by
smugglers, written off as a cost of doing business.

EXCERPTS FROM THE BRADLEY-GORE DEBATE IN IOWA 
</HEADLINE>
  (With IOWA-DEBATE) 
(lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the Democratic presidential debate
Monday night in Des Moines, Iowa, involving Vice President Al Gore
and former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, as recorded by The New
York Times:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some 46,000 people, twice the number predicted, showed up
today for a King Day rally in Columbia, S.C. They were, of course,
protesting the flying of the Confederate battle flag atop the state
Capitol. ... Do you support and do you intend to abide by the
NAACP's boycott of the state of South Carolina until that flag is
removed?
</P>
<P>
   GORE I ask for your support to help bring our country together.
And one of the ways we can bring our country together is to
recognize that the Confederate battle flag divides America. It
stands as a hurtful symbol to millions, not only African-Americans,
because it recalls the pain of slavery. It should be removed from
the State Capitol building in South Carolina and from any
government institution so as to make them welcoming to all of our
citizens. I do not think a president of the United States should
ever boycott an individual state because a president needs to bring
our people together. ...
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY I'd pull it down today. I think it should be withdrawn
absolutely. I think it's an offense to our common humanity and it
is not the future of this country. ... If we're going to move
forward in this country we have to tell the truth. And somebody
once said, many people want to change the world, but few people
want to change themselves. If we're going to make progress on race
in America, we have to do both those. We have to change the
conditions of discrimination and poverty and we have to change our
hearts so that we can bring everybody along as our brother or
sister.
</P>
<P>
   GORE I agree with those comments. ... I think that it's
perfectly true that there are some people who see the Confederate
flag in a different way. And I think that we have to try to bring
them into a shared understanding of why as a symbol it is so
hurtful to the majority. And remember this, 60 percent of the
people of South Carolina want it to come down. It's only the
Republican candidates for president who are so scared of the
extreme right wing that they will be tolerant of intolerance less
they offend the offensive. It ought to come down. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. You know the story very well in upstate New York, Oneonta,
N.Y. Where this elderly white woman was attacked. ... She only saw
one of his hands. And from the color of his skin she knew that he
was an African-American. She filed a police report, and the police
in Oneonta, N.Y., this small college town, arrested, went and
questioned rather, every single African-American man in town. ...
Would you agree with the decision of the 2nd Circuit Court that
said that those cops in that city acted properly?
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY Racial profiling is particularly pernicious because
we're talking about people who pay their taxes, work hard, abide by
the rules and they are plucked out because of our inability to see
beneath skin color or eye shape or ethnicity in this country and
stopped on a regular basis. If I were president of the United
States, I would put an executive order in immediately that would
end racial profiling in the federal government. I would work to get
local police departments to keep data to be able to demonstrate
that there was racial profiling. And then I'd sic the Justice
Department after them to make sure they were going to abide by the
law in which no racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   GORE I said at the beginning of my campaign for president that
on the first day of a Gore presidency, I would issue an executive
order to ban racial profiling. And the first civil rights bill
introduced from the White House of the year 2001 would be a bill
outlawing racial profiling. There's a lot of pain out there in this
country on the part of Latin Americans and Latinos and
Asian-Americans who feel as if they have been singled out unfairly
and sometimes in a very harsh way because of the way they look.
That is unacceptable. ...
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY Al, I know that you would issue an order to end racial
profiling if you were president of the United States. But we have a
president now. You serve with him. I want you to walk down that
hallway, walk into his office and say, ``Sign this executive order
today.''
</P>
<P>
   GORE I don't think President Bill Clinton needs a lecture from
Bill Bradley about how to stand up and fight for African-Americans
and Latinos in this country.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to talk the talk. It's another thing to walk the
walk. whether it's down the hallway _ the mayor of the largest city
in New Jersey, an African-American, Sharpe James, asked for help on
the policy of racial profiling when you were in the Senate. He's
here today and he's supporting me because President Clinton and I
have helped him with racial profiling.

VISITOR FROM THE COLONIES IS LONDON'S BRAVE `MUM OF 3'
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Saturday afternoon, while vacationing in London, the Webster
family of 10 Downing Place in Livingston, N.J., posed by the prime
minister's residence for a snapshot: a memento of their visit to 10
Downing Street.
</P>
<P>
   But the afternoon turned out to be more memorable than they
could have imagined: London newspapers and television have been
calling Ursula Webster a ``Heroine Mum-of-Three'' after she pushed
one of her sons out of the way of a speeding car, which hit her and
severely fractured one of her legs.
</P>
<P>
   The family flew back to New Jersey on Sunday, but not before
Prime Minister Tony Blair invited them to drop by for tea the next
time they are in town.
</P>
<P>
   But first Mrs. Webster, 39, must recuperate from the injuries
that put her on Britain's front pages.
</P>
<P>
   After a bobby took their picture at 10 Downing, the Websters
were on their way through the high iron gate, when an
out-of-control car barreled straight at them and plowed into the
gate. Mrs. Webster shoved Andrew, 8, out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her main concern was the boys,'' said her husband, David, at
the St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, where Mrs. Webster
was having surgery Monday on her broken femur and tibia.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was lying on the ground, in excruciating pain, and she
wanted to know where the kids were,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew was bruised a bit, Webster said, and so was his brother,
Alex, 6, when a side mirror struck his head. Webster and the
youngest son, Peter, 3, were not hurt.
</P>
<P>
   An ambulance took Mrs. Webster to a London hospital, where
doctors treated her. The rest of the family followed in a van.
</P>
<P>
   For her operation, Mrs. Webster chose to return to New Jersey,
where she could receive follow-up treatment, her husband said.
</P>
<P>
   The London police arrested the driver of the car, Stephen
Bonnett, 26, an engineer from Chelmsford, east of London, who was
charged with causing grievous bodily harm and dangerous driving,
the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous articles in London newspapers praised the
``mother-of-three who braved death to push her children to
safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The boys were ``pretty brave, and also in shock,'' their father
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty scary, to realize you could lose your wife and
children in an instant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Had the iron gate been shut, Mrs. Webster and Andrew would
almost certainly have been unable to get out of the car's path, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Webster, a banker, said the family had visited London several
times.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Webster has recovered, he said, they might well accept
Blair's invitation to tour 10 Downing Street from the inside, out
of the range of runaway cars, not to mention news photographers.

CIVIL RIGHTS IS PRIME TOPIC AS DEMOCRATS SQUARE OFF AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ Put to the toughest test yet of their commitments
to civil rights, Vice President Al Gore and former senator Bill
Bradley tried to outdo each other Monday night in vowing to work to
erase the nation's lingering vestiges of racial discord and
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the sharpest exchanges of the last Democratic debate
before Monday's Iowa caucuses, Bradley suggested Gore has failed to
strive hard enough to end racial profiling. Police have used the
practice to stop motorists and to develop suspects based on their
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you would issue an order to end racial profiling if you
were president,'' Bradley told Gore in the Brown &AMP; Black Forum on
minority issues at North High School. ``We have a president now. I
want you to walk down that hallway and walk into his office and
say, `Sign this exective order today.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gore shot back: ``I don't think President Clinton needs a
lecture from Bill Bradley on how to fight for African-Americans and
Latinos.''
</P>
<P>
   But rather than defend the administration's decision not to
order an end to racial profiling, Gore accused Bradley of failing
to heed requests from Newark Mayor Sharpe James to confront the
issue when Bradley was a senator from New Jersey. ``It's one thing
to talk the talk,'' Gore said. ``It's another thing to walk the
walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a word about the most important issue facing Iowa _ farming
_ was spoken in the hour-long debate. In a quirk of the campaign
season, the Brown &AMP; Black Forum is held every four years in the
predominantly white state of Iowa, where the state-wide black
population was just 48,000 in 1990 _ about one third the black
population of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The minority focus could have benefited Bradley by allowing him
to avoid agriculture issues, which have hurt him because of his
generally spotty record on farming. Or it could have hurt Bradley
by preventing him from discussing issues other than race that might
have helped him cut into Gore's wide lead in the Iowa polls.
</P>
<P>
   While both candidates expressed unity in their opposition to
discrimination, they jousted over specifics, from the best way to
combat bias against homosexuals to the potential impact on
minorities of their competing plans for health care and education.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gore appeared taken aback by Bradley's challenge on the
racial profiling issue, he quickly turned to James for support.
James said after the debate that he had approached his ``good
friend'' Bradley many times in the past decade about helping blacks
who were victims of racial profiling. But Bradley insisted it was a
local issue, and that he could not, as a US senator, help, James
said. ``We were a bit disillusioned,'' James said. Bradley's debate
comments were ``nice talk from a nice individual,'' but not enough,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bradley and Gore tip-toed around the question of whether
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, the Cuban boy who survived a perilous
journey from Cuba to the Florida shore, should be returned to his
father. Juan Gonzalez has been pleading for Elian's return since
the boy was rescued clinging to an inner tube Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley each said the best solution was to have Elian's
father come to the US so he can state his wishes unencumbered by
the communist regime of Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The question was awkward for Gore, since failing to back the INS
decision meant repudiating his own administration. But if Gore
stood by the INS ruling to send back Elian, he would have enraged
the Cuban-American community, a small group that is politically
powerful in the key campaign state of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates deftly navigated a couple of politically thorny
questions. Asked whether they would boycott South Carolina because
the Confederate flag flies at its State House, both denounced the
flag. But Gore said he could not, as president, boycott any state,
and Bradley failed to answer the question directly, focusing
instead on the larger issue of racial injustice.
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing fight over health care resurfaced in a racial
context when Bradley was asked if Gore's criticism of his health
care plan ``borders on race-baiting.'' Gore has said Bradley's plan
to eliminate Medicaid and repace it with variable health care
vouchers would hurt lower-income black and Latino citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they border on race baiting,'' Bradley said of
Gore's criticisms. ``I think they do tend to divide people.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates denounced the racially explosive comments made
recently by Atlanta Braves pitcher John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know John Rocker and I don't want to know him,''
Bradley said, adding ``I wouldn't be disappointed if they fired
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley recalled that in his years in he often took it on
himself to police racial sensitivities on the New York Knicks. He
said he would sometimes pull a white teammate aside if he heard him
use ``the wrong words.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' Bradley remembered saying, ``that doesn't work on this
team. If you want to be on this team, you respect everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also deplored Rocker's remarks, but, invoking the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr., he said he hopes that Rocker will
ultimately find forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some, racism may be a form of mental illness. For others,
it is simply a manifestation of evil that they have the ability to
transcend and overcome with love, forgiveness, and redemption,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has received considerable public attention during the
campaign for his commitment to improving race relations, with his
biggest boost coming in December when he was showered with
testimonials from Hall of Fame basketball stars and Hollywood
celebrities at a fund-raiser in Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore has easily outdistanced Bradley in solidifying the
support of black political leaders nationwide. In addition to
focusing for much of the last seven years on wooing black support,
Gore has exploited Clinton's high standing in the minority
community to build a broad organization, particularly in the key
primary states in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has reaped endorsements from 29 members of the 38-member
Congressional Black Caucus to Bradley's none. The only minority
member of Congress to endorse Bradley is Representative Luis V.
Gutierrez of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   As a prelude to the debate, Gore made a highly symbolic visit to
the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta for the annual memorial
service to honor King at the church where he preached and is
buried. In addressing the congregation and placing a wreath at
King's tomb, Gore effectively positioned himself at the center of
black America.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bradley began the day by appearing at a King Day
event in Des Moines with Bill Russell, the former Celtic great who
has made a rare foray into the political arena to support the
former Knick and fellow Hall of Famer. Russell, who first met
Bradley when Bradley was a Rhodes Scholar in the 1960s, said in an
interview that the candidate has since proven to him that he is
imbued with ``total integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell has long borne a reputation as being sensitive to what
he perceives as social pretensions, particularly on matters of
race. For that reason, he suggested, his endorsement of Bradley
carries special weight. He sat in the front row for the debate
Monday night, and he said he will campaign for Bradley later this
week in Boston and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Boston know I'm very picky about my friends,''
Russell said at the Iowa Historical Building. ``But this guy's a
friend of mine, and I'd like to think that him being in that select
group says good things about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Senator John F. Kerry waited to address the group as a
stand-in for Gore. It was Kerry's second King Day appearance of the
morning on Gore's behalf. He had spent the night before organizing
caucus groups for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   On race relations, Kerry said neither Gore nor Bradley stood out
as a leader on civil rights during their years in the Senate. One
of the few memorable moments, Kerry said, was Bradley's speech
condemning the beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles police.
Bradley stunned onlookers by banging the podium 56 times in 81
seconds to signify the number of blows King had suffered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were both very supportive of most of the critical
issues'' on civil rights, Kerry said. But Bradley and Gore were not
members of the key committees that handled civil rights issues,
Kerry said, and were not major participants as a result.

<P>
   DES MOINES _ Put to the toughest test yet of their commitments
to civil rights, Vice President Al Gore and former senator Bill
Bradley tried to outdo each other Monday night in vowing to work to
erase the nation's lingering vestiges of racial discord and
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the sharpest exchanges of the last Democratic debate
before Monday's Iowa caucuses, Bradley suggested Gore has failed to
strive hard enough to end racial profiling. Police have used the
practice to stop motorists and to develop suspects based on their
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you would issue an order to end racial profiling if you
were president,'' Bradley told Gore in the Brown &AMP; Black Forum on
minority issues at North High School. ``We have a president now. I
want you to walk down that hallway and walk into his office and
say, `Sign this exective order today.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gore shot back: ``I don't think President Clinton needs a
lecture from Bill Bradley on how to fight for African-Americans and
Latinos.''
</P>
<P>
   But rather than defend the administration's decision not to
order an end to racial profiling, Gore accused Bradley of failing
to heed requests from Newark Mayor Sharpe James to confront the
issue when Bradley was a senator from New Jersey. ``It's one thing
to talk the talk,'' Gore said. ``It's another thing to walk the
walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a word about the most important issue facing Iowa _ farming
_ was spoken in the hour-long debate. In a quirk of the campaign
season, the Brown &AMP; Black Forum is held every four years in the
predominantly white state of Iowa, where the state-wide black
population was just 48,000 in 1990 _ about one third the black
population of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The minority focus could have benefited Bradley by allowing him
to avoid agriculture issues, which have hurt him because of his
generally spotty record on farming. Or it could have hurt Bradley
by preventing him from discussing issues other than race that might
have helped him cut into Gore's wide lead in the Iowa polls.
</P>
<P>
   While both candidates expressed unity in their opposition to
discrimination, they jousted over specifics, from the best way to
combat bias against homosexuals to the potential impact on
minorities of their competing plans for health care and education.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gore appeared taken aback by Bradley's challenge on the
racial profiling issue, he quickly turned to James for support.
James said after the debate that he had approached his ``good
friend'' Bradley many times in the past decade about helping blacks
who were victims of racial profiling. But Bradley insisted it was a
local issue, and that he could not, as a US senator, help, James
said. ``We were a bit disillusioned,'' James said. Bradley's debate
comments were ``nice talk from a nice individual,'' but not enough,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bradley and Gore tip-toed around the question of whether
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, the Cuban boy who survived a perilous
journey from Cuba to the Florida shore, should be returned to his
father. Juan Gonzalez has been pleading for Elian's return since
the boy was rescued clinging to an inner tube Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley each said the best solution was to have Elian's
father come to the US so he can state his wishes unencumbered by
the communist regime of Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The question was awkward for Gore, since failing to back the INS
decision meant repudiating his own administration. But if Gore
stood by the INS ruling to send back Elian, he would have enraged
the Cuban-American community, a small group that is politically
powerful in the key campaign state of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates deftly navigated a couple of politically thorny
questions. Asked whether they would boycott South Carolina because
the Confederate flag flies at its State House, both denounced the
flag. But Gore said he could not, as president, boycott any state,
and Bradley failed to answer the question directly, focusing
instead on the larger issue of racial injustice.
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing fight over health care resurfaced in a racial
context when Bradley was asked if Gore's criticism of his health
care plan ``borders on race-baiting.'' Gore has said Bradley's plan
to eliminate Medicaid and repace it with variable health care
vouchers would hurt lower-income black and Latino citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they border on race baiting,'' Bradley said of
Gore's criticisms. ``I think they do tend to divide people.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates denounced the racially explosive comments made
recently by Atlanta Braves pitcher John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know John Rocker and I don't want to know him,''
Bradley said, adding ``I wouldn't be disappointed if they fired
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley recalled that in his years in he often took it on
himself to police racial sensitivities on the New York Knicks. He
said he would sometimes pull a white teammate aside if he heard him
use ``the wrong words.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' Bradley remembered saying, ``that doesn't work on this
team. If you want to be on this team, you respect everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also deplored Rocker's remarks, but, invoking the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr., he said he hopes that Rocker will
ultimately find forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some, racism may be a form of mental illness. For others,
it is simply a manifestation of evil that they have the ability to
transcend and overcome with love, forgiveness, and redemption,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has received considerable public attention during the
campaign for his commitment to improving race relations, with his
biggest boost coming in December when he was showered with
testimonials from Hall of Fame basketball stars and Hollywood
celebrities at a fund-raiser in Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore has easily outdistanced Bradley in solidifying the
support of black political leaders nationwide. In addition to
focusing for much of the last seven years on wooing black support,
Gore has exploited Clinton's high standing in the minority
community to build a broad organization, particularly in the key
primary states in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has reaped endorsements from 29 members of the 38-member
Congressional Black Caucus to Bradley's none. The only minority
member of Congress to endorse Bradley is Representative Luis V.
Gutierrez of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   As a prelude to the debate, Gore made a highly symbolic visit to
the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta for the annual memorial
service to honor King at the church where he preached and is
buried. In addressing the congregation and placing a wreath at
King's tomb, Gore effectively positioned himself at the center of
black America.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bradley began the day by appearing at a King Day
event in Des Moines with Bill Russell, the former Celtic great who
has made a rare foray into the political arena to support the
former Knick and fellow Hall of Famer. Russell, who first met
Bradley when Bradley was a Rhodes Scholar in the 1960s, said in an
interview that the candidate has since proven to him that he is
imbued with ``total integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell has long borne a reputation as being sensitive to what
he perceives as social pretensions, particularly on matters of
race. For that reason, he suggested, his endorsement of Bradley
carries special weight. He sat in the front row for the debate
Monday night, and he said he will campaign for Bradley later this
week in Boston and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Boston know I'm very picky about my friends,''
Russell said at the Iowa Historical Building. ``But this guy's a
friend of mine, and I'd like to think that him being in that select
group says good things about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Senator John F. Kerry waited to address the group as a
stand-in for Gore. It was Kerry's second King Day appearance of the
morning on Gore's behalf. He had spent the night before organizing
caucus groups for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   On race relations, Kerry said neither Gore nor Bradley stood out
as a leader on civil rights during their years in the Senate. One
of the few memorable moments, Kerry said, was Bradley's speech
condemning the beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles police.
Bradley stunned onlookers by banging the podium 56 times in 81
seconds to signify the number of blows King had suffered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were both very supportive of most of the critical
issues'' on civil rights, Kerry said. But Bradley and Gore were not
members of the key committees that handled civil rights issues,
Kerry said, and were not major participants as a result.

H-E-R-E'-S JOHNNY: MCCAIN LEAVES 'EM LAUGHING ON THE CAMPAIGN
TRAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: CORRECTS dateline to Hopkinton, sted Hamilton.)

 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOPKINTON, N.H. _ Heard the one about the trees chasing the
dogs? If you were at Sen. John McCain's recent town hall meeting in
Merrimack, you would have. Twice.
</P>
<P>
   It's a little weather joke McCain likes to tell. So little water
in Arizona, the trees chase the dogs. Ba-dum-bum.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty amusing the first time, and it typically gets a chuckle
when the Republican presidential candidate uses it in his opening
remarks on the campaign trail. But even his staff was silent when
McCain recently offered the line a second time to the same
audience. Oops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed that as soon as I said it,'' a sheepish McCain said
later. ``They didn't laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Most candidates have a stump speech. McCain, who favors endless
question-and-answer sessions with the public and the press, has
more of a stand-up routine. His mix of dry sarcasm, terrific timing
and a sweet rasp of a voice is reminiscent of Johnny Carson (they
also have similar hair). He can be funny off the cuff, but the
cuffs are a little worn during long days riding around New
Hampshire in a campaign bus. So he relies on some old standbys:
</P>
<P>
   On who will play him in the movie version of his book, ``Faith
of My Fathers,'' a memoir of three generations of McCain military
men: ``I want Tom Cruise; my kids want Danny DeVito.''
</P>
<P>
   On the book, which many voters bring for him to autograph: ``I'm
not here to hype my book. I would never do that. $24.95, Random
House. It's been four months on the best-seller list, available on
Amazon.com. But I wouldn't hype it.''
</P>
<P>
   On campaign-finance abuses in the 1996 campaign: ``They were
renting out the Lincoln bedroom as though it were a Motel 6. Bill
Clinton was the bellhop.''
</P>
<P>
   On politicians taking credit for things they did not do: ``The
vice president invented the Internet. I invented television.''
</P>
<P>
   On young voters' cynicism about government: ``There's a study
out that says more young people believe Elvis is alive than believe
they'll ever get a Social Security check.''
</P>
<P>
   On early polls in New Hampshire: ``We were at 3 percent. The
margin of error was 5 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the story of 101-year-old Neil Tillotson of
Dixville Notch, who came up with the idea of having his northern
hamlet be the first to count its ballots in this ``first in the
nation'' primary, making the burg a must-stop on every presidential
candidate's tour.
</P>
<P>
   Seems McCain, in his self-described desperation for votes _
including all 29 in Dixville Notch _ has visited with Tillotson not
once but twice this campaign season. Asked who his favorite
Republican was, out of all the candidates he had met, the old man
replied, ``Theodore Roosevelt.'' Ba-dum-bum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think humor is really important,'' McCain said. ``I've
thought it was important all my life. I think it's important in
these kind of, what sometimes get to be high-pressure situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Like when he was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam, tapping out
jokes about Hanoi Hannah, a piece of radio propaganda, in code
through the cell walls. And now in the heat of the presidential
race, where he tells audiences _ over and over and over again _
that his only problem with a television advertisement that shows
Bill Clinton's face morphing into his own is ``that it's the
ugliest picture of me I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   There are self-deprecating lines about how, with white hair at
63, people think he is his school-age children's grandfather. He
makes jabs at the press (``they go from liberal to communist'') and
his staff (``most of them are on work-release programs''), and he
offers a riff on Harry Truman's quest for a one-armed economist
``because economists always say, `On the one hand, on the other
hand.'''
</P>
<P>
   His audience eats it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them just talk serious and serious, but he's with the
people,'' said Caroline Jowders, 78, who has heard the senator's
routine at four campaign events since summer. ``He always has a
sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   In Keene the other night, the crowd was cracking up as if it
were a comedy club.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very entertaining,'' Barbara Hecker said afterward.
``There aren't too many politicians that I think are funny.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also does a mean Bob Dole impression (though he refused
to offer a rendition of the Viagra commercial), and freely admits
that most of his humor is borrowed. (``The trees chase the dogs''
is a Barry Goldwater original, and many others are borrowed from
Morris K. Udall, the late Democratic congressman from Arizona.)
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to one of the candidate's favorite closing
lines. Something about how Goldwater, Udall, and Bruce Babbitt, all
Arizonans, all trod this path before him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona may be the only state where mothers don't tell their
children they can grow up to be president,'' McCain cracks. ``I
want to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ba-dum-bum.
</P>

SOMEBODY TELL LAKERS TO KEEP RICE AROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
The Lakers were hugging the road like a souped-up sports car. They
were accelerating out of hairpin curves and picking up such speed
and momentum, every other Pacific Division team save Portland
appeared to be standing still.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Then came this long weekend. It was a drawn-out, trance-inducing
three days for the Lakers, who hit a couple of bumps in the road
and swerved slightly off course. They lost at Indiana on Friday and
came up short against Seattle 82-81 on Monday at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden that 16-game winning streak looks like a dot in
their rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Two losses in three games is the nearest thing the Lakers have
had all season to a losing skid. To those predisposed to kick Glen
Rice when the Lakers are down _ and you know who you are, Dr. Jerry
Buss _ we have but one thing to say: Where was your mind during the
moment of silence that preceded Monday's game?
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers and SuperSonics bowed their heads for a few seconds
to remember Bobby Phills, the Charlotte swingman who was killed
last week when he lost control of his speeding Porsche and crashed.
Phills' death was a grim reminder of how flimsy the blueprints
built on tomorrows are.
</P>
<P>
   Even plans spared by tragedy are tenuous.
</P>
<P>
   Winning teams come with piddling warranties, as the Lakers
discovered last year when they fired coach Del Harris and traded
Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell and plunged a season of ample
promise into a tailspin from which it never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom does much good come from tinkering with something that
isn't broken. With nothing to show for all their fiddling last
year, the Lakers, one would think, would have moved quickly the
past few weeks to quell the persistent rumors that Rice is on the
trading block.
</P>
<P>
   He may not be the double-digit scorer off the bench or the bona
fide power forward the Lakers are missing or the backup center they
sure wish they had to spell Shaquille O'Neal so he doesn't have to
play 47 minutes, as he did Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But to focus on what the Lakers don't have is to overlook what
they have in Rice: A terrific scoring option down the stretch (just
ask the SuperSonics, whom he torched in the fourth quarter earlier
this month at Seattle).
</P>
<P>
   And for a pure shooter he is a diligent passer. He demonstrated
as much in the first quarter Monday. Rice took three shots and made
eight passes. He fed O'Neal for three of his five baskets and
Bryant for another. How he wound up with just one assist in that
span is as much a mystery as the whereabouts of the Mars Lander.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Rice passing the ball is akin to Luc Robitaille
passing the puck or asking Celine Dion to sing backup. ``I'm just
running the offense,'' he said without resignation or rancor.
</P>
<P>
   He's doing more than that, said Bryant: ``He's giving up part of
himself to be part of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   In a departure from Rice's salad days in Miami and Charlotte,
the screens aren't always set for him. He is finding ways to get
open just the same. Sometimes when that happens, he even gets the
ball. That this doesn't happen often enough is something we learned
from Bryant. Rice is wise enough not to touch the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for us to get Glen in the flow of the game,''
Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   Rice didn't get sucked into the current until the fourth
quarter. He took five shots in that time and made two. If either of
his last two attempts had fallen _ a hook shot to extend the
Lakers' lead to three and a 3-pointer on the next possession to
break a 79-79 deadlock _ his defensive lapses (and those of his
teammates) would have been quietly forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   The truth? Defending the Gary Paytons of the NBA is hard enough
without having to expend a lot of energy defending oneself. For the
record, Rice said, he wants to stay in L.A. for the rest of this
season and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely do,'' said Rice, an impending free agent, ``and
that's one of the things that's really pretty much gotten me
(ticked) off. No one (in the Lakers front office) has ever come and
asked me, `Do you want to be in L.A.?' I would have told them,
`Yes, I want to be here.' It doesn't get any better than this. It's
a joy to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   So assure him of at least a few more months of bliss, already.
</P>
<P>
   The best move Buss or Jerry West could make before the Feb. 24
trading deadline? That would be pulling Rice aside and telling him
he isn't going anywhere for the rest of this season and meaning it.
</P>
<P>
   Anything short of that and the front office is not merely
feeding the rumors, it's feeding the anxiety of a player who
already is experiencing discomfort trying to fit his square peg of
a game into the triangle offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at peace regardless of all the talk I hear that the Lakers
have to get rid of Glen Rice,'' Rice said. ``I don't allow myself
to be affected by it.''
</P>
<P>
   His tired tone made us wonder if it was us Rice was trying to
convince or himself. &QL;

`THE MARY KAY LETOURNEAU STORY': A TEACHER STRAYS FAR FROM THE
LESSON PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Pditors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mary Kay Letourneau's childhood explains a lot.
</P>
<P>
   You remember Ms. Letourneau; she was the 35-year-old Washington
state schoolteacher who had an affair with a 13-year-old student,
gave birth to his child, went to prison and had another baby by
him.
</P>
<P>
   What you probably don't know about is her family background, and
that's what ``The Mary Kay Letourneau Story: All-American Girl,''
Tuesday night's film on USA, has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Ms. Letourneau (Penelope Ann Miller, giving an
intelligent, beautifully controlled performance) fascinating is her
seemingly sincere conviction that she did nothing wrong in
conducting a sexual relationship with a child. Even Humbert
Humbert, not your paragon of emotional responsibility, admitted to
himself that he shouldn't have been fooling around with Lolita. So
what kind of woman could see the world this way? What kind of
childhood and moral education would such a person have had?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Letourneau's father was John Schmitz, the former congressman
who ran for president in 1972 under the banner of the American
Independent Party. Schmitz (Chris Bondy), an ultra-conservative
California Republican who was accustomed to protesters outside his
home, was little Mary Kay's hero. And at one point there was a
minor scandal about his having slept with students of his own
(albeit college students). He is, however, so opposed to sex
education that he transfers Mary Kay to a new school so she won't
be exposed to it.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Mary Kay's father is the only one who isn't
appalled by her adult behavior (except Mary Kay's court-appointed
psychiatrist, played by Mercedes Ruehl, who believes her problem is
bipolar depression).
</P>
<P>
   The story begins in 1995, when Mary Kay, a wife and mother so
happy that she sings while making breakfast, gets a telephone call
and learns that her father has prostate cancer. She's horribly
upset, and she gets no emotional support; when she tells her
husband the news, he doesn't even bother to turn off the electric
shaver while she talks. Later, as she's taking a misbehaving
student to the school office, she begins to cry in the hallway and
tells the student about her father. Yes, that student is Vili
Fualaau (Omar Anguiano), the future father of her children.
</P>
<P>
   Anguiano does a fine job of conveying youthful knowingness, but
he does not for a second look 13 years old. This was always the
problem with putting ``Lolita'' on the screen, too: how to convey
the innocence and inexperience of childhood when no one would stand
for casting an actor or actress the actual age of the character.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately ``The Mary Kay Letourneau Story'' doesn't have much
to say. Laying out the details of the case, it doesn't find a way
to explore the moral issues fully. Vili bets his friends $20 he can
seduce the teacher. Clearly he was a willing sex partner, but he
was still a child, with only 13 years of experience in the world to
guide his actions. One of the responsibilities of adulthood is
remembering not to treat children as if they were equals in
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   The film's accomplishment is making Ms. Letourneau's actions
believable. As the months pass, Mary Kay and Vili have occasion to
talk privately, once sitting by the campfire on a school field
trip. Julie Heberts' restrained script reminds us how common
student-teacher crushes are by having one of Mary Kay's fellow
teachers tease her, saying with a smile, ``That boy is so in love
with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Kay answers, ``Don't be silly.'' But by spring 1996 she is
taking late-night telephone calls from Vili during which he
serenades her by guitar. One summer night, after Mary Kay and her
husband have fought, she and Vili have sex for the first time. She
is arrested early in 1997 after a relative of her husband's reports
the affair to the school.
</P>
<P>
   With impeccable timing, Mary Kay gives birth to her and Vili's
daughter in August 1997, six days after she has pleaded guilty to
rape. She is found guilty, but the judge goes easy on her, at
first. Today Ms. Letourneau is serving seven and a half years in
prison, where she gave birth to her second daughter with Vili in
1998. She expects to be released in 2005, when her young lover will
be 22.

   The British collector Charles Saatchi, whose ``Sensation''
exhibition has just closed at the Brooklyn Museum of Art in New
York, had a run-in with Peter Norton over a work that is part of
Norton's current donation to 29 museums.
</P>
<P>
   Norton is giving to the Tate Gallery in London ``The Wizard'' by
John Currin, a young American painter who often paints parodies of
pornography featuring buxom women. ``The Wizard'' shows a woman
wearing black gloves fondling another woman's breasts.
</P>
<P>
   Some time ago Saatchi said that he had completed a deal to buy
``The Wizard'' from Clyde Beswick, a California businessman and
collector. Meanwhile Beswick was convicted of embezzling money from
Brody Smythe Direct, a Pasadena-based mail-order company that he
founded.
</P>
<P>
   He served 11 months in prison and was sued for divorce by his
wife, Karen. His art collection was seized by the courts, which
ordered that it be sold, with the money to go toward legal fees and
the divorce settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 the courts approved Norton's acquisition of the entire
Beswick collection for $1.5 million. This included ``The Wizard.''
Saatchi then sued for the work. He lost. Now Norton has donated the
picture to the Tate, meaning that it will be in the major museum of
modern art in Saatchi's home city.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my point of view it was just two gentlemen disagreeing,''
Norton said. ``Both of us thought it was rightfully his. It
appeared that Saatchi took the situation more seriously, but maybe
that was just his lawyers. Irrespective of his manner of handling
it, he was quite reasonable to believe it might be his. It's just
one of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Norton still seems to be enjoying the twist of circumstances
that permits him to be a benefactor on Saatchi's turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sent it to the Tate cognizant of Saatchi,'' he said. ``The
Tate was very interested, and Saatchi had wanted it in Britain, as
his property. So we at least fulfilled part of his desire by
sending it there.''

PROSECUTORS PRESS WIFE TO TESTIFY IN FRAUD CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Invoking the legal principle of spousal privilege,
the wife of a Syracuse, N.Y., businessman who was convicted of
creating one of the largest financial frauds in American history is
refusing to answer questions under oath concerning conversations
she had with him about his assets.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen K. Bennett, whose husband, Patrick R. Bennett, is scheduled
to be sentenced next week in U.S. District Court in Manhattan,
refused in a Jan. 7 deposition in Syracuse to respond to questions
regarding her conversations with Bennett about certain assets that
are in her name or in trusts for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett was convicted over the course of two jury trials last
year on charges of bank fraud, money laundering, securities fraud
involving promissory notes and perjury. All those charges arose out
of a scheme that defrauded more than 10,000 investors, many of them
elderly, of more than $600 million, the prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of the office of Mary Jo White, U.S. attorney for
the Southern District of New York, which had taken the deposition,
Judge John S. Martin Jr. of U.S. District Court has ordered Mrs.
Bennett to appear before him on Thursday to explain her refusal to
answer the questions about the assets, which include the family's
home and a 100-acre horse farm in Oneida, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   When Bennett was convicted, he was ordered to forfeit $109
million to the government. But last fall, the government said that
Bennett was ``hiding assets'' behind ``fraudulent transfers to his
wife.'' In a hearing last month, Martin, questioning whether Mrs.
Bennett was living ``in luxury'' on victims' money, asked for
further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that every dollar of money he and his family
had taken from the investors in this case be repaid,'' Martin said
Dec. 3, suggesting that prosecutors question Mrs. Bennett under
oath. The government then took the deposition on Jan. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, 47, faces a sentence of roughly 15 to 20 years under
federal guidelines, but Martin said the potential sentence ``is
almost without limit if I am persuaded that Bennett and his family
continued to maintain funds that rightfully belonged to people whom
they defrauded.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the lawyer-client privilege, the privilege over private
communications between husband and wife is almost absolute, legal
experts say, even when one spouse confesses a crime to another. But
the privilege ends if one spouse joins in the illegal activities of
the other, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for each of the Bennetts, who have been married about 11
years, said prosecutors were improperly trying to force Mrs.
Bennett to break confidences protected by the spousal privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``The privilege is absolute unless it's shown to be in
furtherance of a fraud,'' said Bennett's lawyer, Michael D.
Pinnisi. ``No one has shown that Mrs. Bennett participated in any
fraudulent conduct whatsoever. The government didn't allege it in
the indictment. There was no proof at trial. She has never been
indicted.''
</P>
<P>
   In the trials, prosecutors said that Bennett had used his
family's company, Bennett Funding Group of Syracuse, which claimed
to finance office-equipment leases, to carry out the fraud from
1990 to 1996. Prosecutors said Bennett had spent millions of
dollars he took from his company to buy a local horse racing track,
hotels and gambling enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett's lawyers said he was merely an inept businessman who
had been overwhelmed by his fast-growing company, and had never
intended to commit any crimes.

SEATTLE, PAYTON BEAT LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
Exposed as mortals, or at least a bad warmup act, the Lakers fell
to basketball Earth on Monday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another day, another streak snapped, this their 14-game home
winning streak after the Seattle SuperSonics played them tight in
the fourth quarter and then won it 82-81 when Gary Payton capped an
outstanding game by drilling an open 3-pointer with 15.9 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after the Pacers snapped the Lakers' 16-game winning
streak in Indiana, the Lakers stumbled at home for the first time
since the Grizzlies surprised them here back on Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's shaky effort was in an afternoon game and preceded the
later Clippers affair against the Spurs, the first Staples Center
basketball doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Lakers couldn't get into opening for the Clippers, but
that stifling defense and precision offense that had marked their
impressive run mostly took the day off.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers complained of fatigue _ what with their playing a
Monday afternoon game following a Saturday night game in Minnesota
_ but this one had the looks of a game the Lakers just sort of
expected to pull out when the time came.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were going to get 'em,'' said Lakers guard Kobe
Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no getting to the blazing Payton, who finished
with 36 points _ two off his career-high _ and added seven assists
and six rebounds. Payton was a whirlwind operating at a different
level from everyone else, or at least one determined to exorcise
any demons from the 19-point lead the Sonics blew to the Lakers at
home nine days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Another strong overall game from Shaquille O'Neal _ 30 points,
10 rebounds, six assists, four blocks _ was about all the Lakers
could answer with.
</P>
<P>
   But after O'Neal made one of two free throws with 30.2 seconds
remaining to give the Lakers an 81-79 lead, every single silent
soul in the sellout crowd of 18,997 knew Payton would try to hit a
3-pointer. Then he make it look easy.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Laker and would-be Kobe stopper Ruben Patterson set a routine
screen on Ron Harper near the 3-point line above the key. When
Harper tried to work under the screen, Payton simply popped back
out and confidently swished a 27-footer.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Harper, unhappy with the Lakers' overall defensive
effort, was quick to take responsibility for the lapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my fault,'' Harper said. ``I ran under the screen. Hey,
I'll take the blame. I don't have a problem with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers still had a last chance to win the game, but Bryant
missed an open jumper from the baseline. Robert Horry missed the
follow shot and the rebound went back to Bryant, who penetrated
toward the basket but went out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to draw a foul,'' Bryant said. ``I didn't draw it very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics inbounded the ball with 1.8 seconds left, and
amazingly the ball suddenly popped out to Rice three feet from the
basket. But Rice couldn't get a shot off in time, which fittingly,
on a night the Lakers shot 40 percent from the field, missed
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   This was a game that could easily have been lacking suspense by
the fourth quarter. The Lakers had somewhat methodically pulled
away from Seattle to start the second half, building a nine-point
lead with five minutes to play in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But with Payton and ex-Clipper Brent Barry (17 points) leading
the way, the Sonics charged back with a 15-2 run to close the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the kind of games if you've been watching them long
enough, you know someone is going to get hurt at the end,'' Lakers
coach Phil Jackson said. ``We just missed too many opportunities
and played so poorly from mid-third quarter on, that it was due to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though there could be finger-pointing anywhere along the
line, a lot of the finger-pointing is back at yourself in this one.
Everyone had a piece of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are still a league-best 32-7, but feeling slightly
less bullet-proof after losing two of their past three.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to win as many as possible at home,'' O'Neal said.
``You can't let one slip away. We have to get back on track, and we
will.'' &QL;

HARPER RAISES DEFENSIVE QUESTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
It's hard to be too critical and lash out when your team is riding
a 16-game winning streak, but after the Lakers unexpectedly lost
for the second time in three games Monday, guard Ron Harper acted
like a man who had been waiting to vent.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harper took responsibility for letting Seattle's Gary Payton pop
free for his game-winning 3-pointer, but let it be known the Lakers
acted like a team that had forgotten it had ridden an impressive
defense to its winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to be a team, then everyone has to lay it on
the line,'' Harper said. ``It's easy to go down there and shoot the
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to learn how to defend, stop folks, or at least act
like you're trying. You have to help somebody out, don't you think?
It isn't that hard a game. It's simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton was running amok all afternoon in the Sonics' 82-81
victory, scoring 36 points. When he'd break free of Harper, often
on a screen, he would too often find himself open for a medium
jumper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary Payton had a great game,'' Harper said. ``He's a great
ballplayer who comes out and goes hard every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a great defensive game by our team. We had some guys
play good, but as a whole we didn't have a good defensive game.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, Kobe Bryant was 1 of 8 from the field. After
three quarters, Glen Rice was 2 for 8. Bryant ended up 6 for 18,
and 0 for 5 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   THEY'RE SO TIRED: Lakers coach Phil Jackson said after playing
Saturday night in Minnesota and then Monday afternoon at the
Staples Center, fatigue appeared a factor in the Lakers'
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you can't shoot the ball any better than that (40
percent), those are either leg fatigue or terrific defense,''
Jackson said. ``And I didn't think they closed out shots. A lot of
guys had open shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said it's not unusual to see teams struggle in a Monday
afternoon game on Martin Luther King Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of these Martin Luther King _ I don't even
want his name associated with the game _ but these morning games
are like this,'' he said. ``They're all pretty pathetic games and
this certainly followed up on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Bryant: ``It was like practice. We had a bunch of old
bones. It took everybody awhile to warm up.''
</P>
<P>
   TIDBITS: Jackson wasn't thrilled the officiating, either,
claiming Bryant was fouled on his final drive: ``They did as
pathetic a job refereeing as we did playing it.''... The Lakers
were 3 of 21 from the 3-point line.... The Lakers held a moment of
silence before the game for Hornets guard Bobby Phills. &QL;

<P>
   DETROIT _ In the first acknowledgment by the world's largest
corporation that it cannot go it alone, the chairman of General
Motors Corp. said Monday night that the company would rely more on
partnerships and would better be described as ``the General Motors
group.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our approach is to develop long-term relationships with other
companies that offer a unique advantage to the General Motors group
of brands and businesses,'' said John F. Smith Jr., chairman and
chief executive of GM, who was speaking at the Automotive News
World Congress here. ``This alliance strategy is our major thrust,
and it is clearly a different approach to growth than most people
have associated with General Motors _ or with the rest of the
industry, for that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The change in philosophy is remarkable for a company so large
that its spending seems to dwarf Third World economies, one so big
that a factory closing can attract more attention than the closing
of a U.S. military base, and one that can be as difficult to turn
as a battleship.
</P>
<P>
   ``No automaker today has the resources to achieve leadership in
all regions and all product segments on its own,'' Smith said, not
even GM, with its global presence and scores of household names _
from the Chevrolet Camaro to the Cadillac DeVille.
</P>
<P>
   GM has longstanding alliances with Isuzu Motors, Suzuki Motor
and Toyota Motor. But it has recently expanded some partnerships,
forged new ones and even formed three-way alliances. It is also
employing the alliance strategy with gusto when it comes to
Internet business initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, GM and Toyota formed a manufacturing partnership to
include research and development on fuel-cell and gas-electric
hybrid vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   About a month ago it formed an alliance with Fuji Heavy
Industries and its Subaru brand. GM benefits from Fuji's strength
in small sport utility vehicles, continuously variable
transmissions and all-wheel-drive systems, while Fuji can look
forward to sharing GM's vehicle platforms and other technologies.
</P>
<P>
   GM has also cut a deal with Honda Motor Co. in which Honda will
contribute six-cylinder engines and transmissions for a future
vehicle, and GM's previous partner, Isuzu, will send Honda diesel
engines for European sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are also discussing collaboration with Honda on other
technology and other business opportunities,'' Smith said. ``We
expect the value of the experience of working together, getting to
know each other at the individual level as well as companies, to
far outweigh the limited scope of this initial agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last week GM said it would buy the half of Saab Automobile
of Sweden that it did not already own. And it is now in talks to
buy some assets of Daewoo Motor of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not rule out acquisitions and mergers as opportunities
arise,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of alliances will play an important role in GM's
Internet strategies, Smith said. Last week alone, GM said it would
enter marketing partnerships with Sony, America Online and NetZero.
On Monday night Smith said GM was working on another alliance that
would give customers using GM's Onstar communications program a
single bill for that service and for wireless phone service _ most
likely a deal with a large telecommunications provider. That deal
could comes within days, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While GM has already predicted that its Onstar service would
have a million customers by the end of this year, Smith also said
Monday night that Onstar would have 4 million customers by 2003.
Onstar customers can now call operators, who are able to call tow
trucks when needed or even make restaurant reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Before the end of the year, GM expects 400,000 Onstar customers
to have the capability to use voice-recognition systems and
cellular phone connections to talk to their cars, and to reach the
Internet.

KINGS ON THE RIGHT TRACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
The Stanley Cup was not built in a day. And five losing weeks are
not going to undo the Kings' dream of having one someday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   If anything, the Kings' 2-10-1 record the past 13 games
illustrates just how many elements go into winning hockey's biggest
prize.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are moving in the right direction even if they keep
dropping in the standings. They are learning lessons from losing
that will help them for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one goal this season when the Kings moved into
Staples Center. Make the playoffs. There needed to be tangible
proof that this building was not just a cash cow for the owners and
a playpen for the city's corporate elite.
</P>
<P>
   The team needed to create an excitement that extended far beyond
the brass and marble. Despite all that has happened with injuries
to most of the two front lines and both goaltenders, the Kings are
well within that goal.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to win the Pacific Division, but that isn't
going to happen even without all the injuries. The Kings brought a
lot of emotional baggage over from the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The best sign that they have left some behind is the attitude
the club has kept in the face of defeat. The games are not always
well-played, but the effort is there and the crowds are responding.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, morale was the Kings' biggest problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where we would have been then if this happened to
us,'' goaltender Jamie Storr said. ``The whole thing can be very
fragile, but there is real confidence in the dressing room that
this will get turned around.''
</P>
<P>
   New coach Andy Murray said early this season that there is a
reason his players have so little Stanley Cup experience. They have
to learn how to win.
</P>
<P>
   It is no different than what Bill Parcells did with the New York
Jets or even Phil Jackson is doing with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Murray is quick to point out that the Lakers were one of the
league's better teams even before Jackson arrived. He must not have
watched the NBA playoffs the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, whose team has made the playoffs just once in the past
six seasons, is building from the bottom. But even the best have
learned from mistakes. The Dallas Stars and Detroit Red Wings, who
combined to win the past three Stanley Cups, each suffered on their
way to the top. Both had seasons in which they had the league's
best record only to lose early in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But if you look at the Kings players, their careers have little
postseason experience.
</P>
<P>
   Look at Ziggy Palffy and Bryan Smolinski, who came over last
summer from the New York Islanders. Palffy has never been in
playoff game. Smolinski hasn't in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Smolinski even went to Murray in training camp to say he wanted
to be worked extra hard because he feared he had forgotten how to
win.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy was the team's leading scorer until he was hit with back
spasms six weeks ago. It is not a coincidence that the team's slide
began around the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Smolinski is now the team's leading scorer with 38 points, but
he is still in the learning process. There are some nights when he
is brilliant, others when he disappears. Smolinski made tactical
mistakes Saturday night on both goals by San Jose's Owen Nolan.
That put the Kings down 2-0 in a game they tied, then lost, in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   With the success of the Smolinski/Palffy deal, it would see that
trades might be the way to go to build the team for the next level.
</P>
<P>
   They certainly need to improve their first line and evaluate the
future of Jozef Stumpel as the center on the top unit. He looked
like a steal from Boston two years ago when he had 58 assists and
79 points. But since then he has missed so much time to injuries,
linemates have generated little offense.
</P>
<P>
   The team looked at Carolina's holdout Keith Primeau earlier this
year. They'll look again next summer.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with trades is the Kings do not have much to deal.
Rob Blake is untouchable, the captain and the backbone of the team.
After injuries last season, he has regained his spot among the
league's top one or two defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   Luc Robitaille still has the scoring touch, but at 34 he's in
the last year of his contract. He has far more value as the Kings'
most popular player than anywhere else. Expect him to get dropped,
however, to the second unit as the team takes some of their luxury
box money to find an elite player for the first line.
</P>
<P>
   Goaltender Stephane Fiset has struggled since his return from a
hand injury. He also will be entering the first season of a
three-year contract extension. If he isn't taken in next summer's
expansion draft, Fiset probably could not bring more than a draft
choice in trade.
</P>
<P>
   The most marketable King is defenseman Aki Berg, even though he
has spent the past two games on the bench because of poor play.
Berg, 23, has enormous skill, but also has struggled coming back
after sitting out a year in Finland in a contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have been bitten by trading defensemen before. In
1992-93, the year they went to the Stanley Cup Finals, the Kings
had three young defensemen:
</P>
<P>
   Blake, Alexei Zhitnik and Darryl Sydor.
</P>
<P>
   All three have become All-Stars, but only Blake is a King.
Zhitnik was sent to Buffalo in a deal that included aging
goaltender Grant Fuhr. Sydor was traded to Dallas in Feb. 1996 for
Shane Churla and Doug Smolek. Neither are still with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all they are still moving forward. Not too fast, but
moving. Right now, you shouldn't ask for more. &QL;

   UNITED NATIONS _ Rolf Ekeus, the Swedish arms control expert who
found and destroyed large quantities of Iraqi weapons after the war
in 1991 in the Persian Gulf, was called back on Monday by
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to lead a new commission created to
finish the job more than a year after monitoring broke down.
</P>
<P>
   Annan made the appointment after a deadline on Sunday came and
went for the Security Council to come up with its own nomination.
But in naming Ekeus without achieving consensus in the council, the
secretary-general was in effect daring Iraq's supporters on the
council, particularly Russia and China, to veto his choice.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has long criticized Ekeus, who headed the U.N.
arms-inspection team from 1991 to 1997, and ridiculed his selection
as ``old wine in a new bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday evening, Russia formally registered its objections,
throwing the nomination of Ekeus, now Sweden's ambassador to the
United States, into doubt and setting up a confrontation between
Washington and Moscow. China, increasingly ready to take a cue from
the Russians, may also weigh in against the appointment. The French
could then break ranks with Britain and other European countries
that support the American position.
</P>
<P>
   A new showdown over Iraq is something that the Clinton
administration has, by most accounts, sought desperately to avoid
in an election year. American diplomats had seemed hopeful earlier
Monday that there would be no serious challenges to Annan's choice.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council is to take up the issue at 3 p.m. on
Tuesday, diplomats said. There are concerns among council
delegations that friends of Iraq, led by Russia, intend to make
this discussion into what American politicians would recognize as a
filibuster. By stalling action on a new inspection system, they
could indefinitely postpone any resolution of the Iraq crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, support for economic sanctions is steadily eroding,
most of all in Russia and France, where business interests are
paramount.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since the invasion of Kuwait
in August 1990. To have them lifted, it has to meet disarmament
requirements in biological, chemical, nuclear and missile systems.
But officials here predict that additional nations may be tempted
to expand commercial interests in Iraq, which is selling oil at
record prices under a more generous program intended to provide
civilians with needed goods. Iraq's recent history would indicate
that it will try to use the cover of civilian imports to acquire
material for weapons.
</P>
<P>
   A Security Council resolution on Dec. 17 to revise U.N. policy
toward Iraq and send arms inspectors back to the country stipulated
that a new chief arms inspector be named in 30 days. Annan had
spent several weeks steering through multiple objections to a long
list of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over 30 days, he raised something like 25 names and could not
find one on which all could agree,'' Annan's spokesman, Fred
Eckhard, said. ``So he put forward the name of the person he
thought best for the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Ekeus was chosen with at least the tacit approval, if not on the
urging of the Clinton administration, some U.N. officials and
diplomats say. His appointment was quickly applauded by the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thank the secretary-general for his exhaustive efforts to
find a candidate who meets the rigorous criteria necessary to carry
out this important disarmament mission,'' a statement by a
spokesman for the State Department, James P. Foley, said. Some
diplomats and officials, who have watched the administration
steadily withdraw from involvement on the Iraqi issue here, said
with Ekeus in place administration officials could assure critics
that a credible chief inspector was back on the job, even if
sanctions were ultimately lifted in the process.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both Congress and the administration have had disagreements with
Annan in the past over his handling of Iraq, in particular his trip
to Baghdad in February 1998. That was even though the agreement
that he signed there ended a stalemate over inspections, sparing
the United States from having to take military action then.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Washington also objected to two of Annan's appointees in
Iraq, saying they were too sympathetic to the government.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, diplomats and arms-control experts have said
that Annan could not afford to be seen as giving in to Iraq on a
new inspector.
</P>
<P>
   Managing the issue now lies with the president of the Security
Council this month, Richard C. Holbrooke. On Monday, Holbrooke, who
has largely stayed clear of Iraq since his arrival in August as the
American representative, gave council members 24 hours to study
Annan's nomination of Ekeus and decide whether they would challenge
it. Russia was the first to raise an objection.
</P>
<P>
   Had there been no objections, Ekeus would have automatically
become executive chairman of the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, too, immediately attacked the nomination. Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz, who is visiting Spain, called the move
dishonest. For several weeks the Iraqis, apparently expecting a
more conciliatory gesture from the secretary-general, have been
harshly critical of Annan in the controlled Iraqi press. While
serving as chief inspector in Iraq from 1991 to 1997, Ekeus was
routinely vilified by the Iraqis, who called him ``the damned
Ekeus'' and accused him of, among other things, causing the
starvation of Iraqi children and being an Israeli spy.
</P>
<P>
   In his low-keyed, methodic way, Ekeus kept up the pressure on
Iraq in a protracted game of cat and mouse. He sent divers to the
depths of a canal to find illegally imported missile parts that the
Iraqis had hurriedly jettisoned. He documented a nuclear program
larger than atomic weapons experts had imagined existed. He
badgered Iraq on its unacceptable accounting for biological warfare
materials until literally cartons of damning information were
suddenly ``found'' on a chicken farm _ and still he wasn't
satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at the end of his tenure in June 1997, Ekeus
said that Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, never gave up plans to
build biological and chemical weapons, and that the Iraqis were
prepared to lie at every step of the inspection process to conceal
and salvage their illicit programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell the most incredible stories,'' Ekeus said. ``It's
like the `Thousand and One Nights,' where every night they tell a
different story to save themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Ekeus was criticized, however, for agreeing in 1996 to Iraqi
demands for restrictions on inspections at some sites close to the
Iraqi leadership. Some arms control experts say that, from that
moment on, Iraq steadily widened the wedge of ``unacceptable''
searches and ``off limits'' sites, barring inspectors from
presidential palaces and ministerial offices where they suspected
documents and equipment might have been hidden.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Butler, the Australian arms control expert who followed
Ekeus as chairman of the first disarmament commission, known as
UNSCOM, inherited a fast-unraveling inspection system and
ultimately lost the support of the Clinton administration in
efforts to stand up to the Iraqis.

KINGS WORRIED ABOUT PALFFY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
LOS ANGELES _ The Kings have been meeting with their medical staff
to determine to what extent Ziggy Palffy's lower-back strain has
hurt his effectiveness.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Palffy was the club's leading scorer when he developed back
spasms in early December. He has one goal since and missed several
practices, raising questions about his conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy's injury has frustrated coach Andy Murray, who often
doesn't know if his top winger can play until after pregame
warmups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear Ziggy and his girlfriend are going back to Slovakia
this summer to open a health club,'' Murray said. ``I hope he buys
a membership.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings trainer Pete Demers says Palffy's conditioning is fine,
but the overall strength of his torso area needs improving.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have put him on a trunk stabilization program,'' Demers
said. ``He's getting stronger, but it is difficult when you have to
do it during an NHL season. This is not the off-season where you
can go all out. I don't want to wear him out in the weight room
before a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Demers said there are several areas that can help relieve stress
on Palffy's back. The first is improving his abdominal strength.
The Kings staff also is working on increasing flexibility in
Palffy's hamstrings and building strength in his glutes (backside).
</P>
<P>
   Palffy missed just three games during his first four seasons
with the New York Islanders. He already has missed four because of
back problems and often has had trouble playing during the Kings'
2-10-1 slide the past five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he got here, Ziggy had tremendous jump in his game,''
Murray said. ``That is what he's missing now. We know this is
something that will be around all year, but we desperately need him
back to where he was.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT ABOUT FISET: With the return of Jamie Storr, who will start
tonight against Buffalo, Stephane Fiset has moved to a backup role.
Fiset struggled after coming back too quickly from a bruised right
hand and goaltender consultant Don Edwards said the slower pace
will help Fiset regain his timing and confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took over for Jamie before he was ready and he developed
some bad habits,'' Edwards said. ``Now you have a chance to tinker
with a few things without having to take them into a game. A couple
practices and he should be ready again.''
</P>
<P>
   ON THE MEND: Jozef Stumpel, sidelined the past two weeks with a
knee injury, will attempt to skate today for the first time, but
still is probably two weeks away. Donald Audette, sidelined the
past two weeks with a sprained ankle, won't begin skating until the
end of the week. Glen Murray, who went on injured reserve Friday
with a deep chest bruise, is expected to miss two to three weeks. &QL;
