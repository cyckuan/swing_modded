<HEADLINE> France "Very Worried" About New Israeli Blockade of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- France said today that it is "very
worried" about the effects of the new blockade by Israel of the
Palestinian territory of West Bank, saying that this measure would
make it impossible for Palestinians to go to holy places in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"This situation, which is not new, is particularly badly
experienced in this period of the festival of Aid al-Adha
(festival of sacrifice of Muslims). This is why France hopes that
the Palestinians, whatever their religious belief, could have free
access to the holy places, " said French Foreign Ministry
spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
Citing risks of terrorist attacks, Israel imposed a new
blockade upon the West Bank Tuesday evening one day after it
lifted it.
</P>
<P>
On the Euro-Mediterranean conference held this week in Veletta,
Malta, the spokesman said that although this conference failed to
solve any problem, it "began to create the conditions more
favorable to the de-blockade of the peace process."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Slips as Exports Reach Record Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit dropped
slightly to 11.6 billion U.S. dollars in February as increased
demand for civilian aircraft and chemicals helped stimulate U.S.
exports to a record high, the Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The February trade imbalance was 8.5 percent lower than
January's deficit of 12.7 billion dollars, which is the highest
figure on record since the government adopted a new system of
tracking the monthly flows of both goods and services.
</P>
<P>
U.S. exports of goods and services in the month were up 4
percent to an all-time high of 73.5 billion dollars. Imports also
set a record high, climbing 2.1 percent to 85.1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the export side, sales of American civilian aircraft rose by
625 million dollars to a total of 1.7 billion dollars. Other
sizable gains were recorded in sales of telecommunications
equipment, chemicals, machinery and computer chips.
</P>
<P>
On the import side, demand for foreign cars and parts was up
2.4 percent to 12.3 billion dollars which double the total of U.S.
automotive exports.
</P>
<P>
America's foreign oil imports were up 14 percent in February to
5.7 billion dollars on a seasonally adjusted basis. The volume of
crude oil imports shot up by 12.4 percent although the price fell
by 8.1 percent from an average of 21.99 dollars per barrel in
January.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade deficit with Japan narrowed by 0.9 percent to
4.3 billion dollars, but for the first two months of the year the
deficit is running 11 percent higher over the same period a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with Canada dropped by 12.8 percent to 1.48 billion
dollars as U.S. exports to Canada rose sharply to 12.1 billion
dollars, the highest total in history for any single country. The
deficit with Mexico was down 1.1 percent to 1.27 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Even with the small improvement, the U.S. trade deficit for the
year was running at an annual rate of 145.6 billion dollars, a
sharp increase from an imbalance of 114.3 billion dollars for
1996, which was the worst in eight years.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin, Kohl Begin Talks on NATO, War Trophies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today
began a one-day meeting with visiting Russian President Boris
Yeltsin in the spa town of Baden-Baden in Germany's Black Forest.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are expected to discuss NATO's eastward
expansion and the fate of War World II trophy art -- some one
million German art treasures, two million rare books and ancient
archives -- seized by then Soviet Union in 1945 from defeated
Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin supports the return of the art treasures to Germany,
but the Russian parliament has passed a law declaring the works
the property of the Russian state.
</P>
<P>
The trophies, reportedly worth 65 billion US dollars, include
paintings by Monet, Degas, Renoire, El Greco, Goya, Rembrandt and
Rubens and a legendary golden treasure unearthed by German
archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann in Troy.
</P>
<P>
Russian sources said Yeltsin will return a few art objects to
Kohl during his two-day stay in Baden-Baden as a sign of good
will.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was initially scheduled as a ceremony for Yeltsin
to receive a "Man of the Year" award by a German media group, but
was upgraded to summit-level talks, partly given the pressing
issue of NATO's eastward expansion which Russia opposes.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between Moscow and NATO on a new security
partnership charter due to be signed in Paris on May 27 have
stalled.
</P>
<P>
Russia is demanding a binding charter that NATO will not deploy
troops or nuclear weapons on the territories of its would-be
member states -- former members of Warsaw Pact.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, accompanied by his wife and daughter, arrived in
Germany Wednesday afternoon and will go home tomorrow. This is his
second foreign trip since his heart operation last November.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government has paid
tributes to former Israeli president Chaim Herzog, who died at the
age of 78 early today, saying he was "a distinguished Irishman."
</P>
<P>
Alan Shatter, chairman of Ireland's joint foreign affairs
committee, was quoted by reports from Dublin as saying today that
Herzog, who was born in 1918 in Belfast, was a "man of great
intellect and dynamism."
</P>
<P>
"He was sincerely committed to peace and reconciliation between
Israel, neighboring Arab states and Palestinians. His passing will
be deeply mourned by all those who had the privilege of knowing
him," Shatter said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government is reported as preparing for a state
funeral for Herzog, who was Israel's president for a decade until

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Tobacco Prices Expected to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 17 (Xinhua) -- All is set for the commencement of
Zimbabwe's tobacco marketing season with over 214,000 tonnes of a
much improved tobacco crop expected to go under the hammer at an
average price higher than last year's.
</P>
<P>
The volume of the crop to go through the sales, which open on
April 22 and 28 in Harare and Mutare of east Zimbabwe
respectively, will, however, be lower than that of the previous
year because of incessant rains which caused water logging,
Tobacco Marketing Board Chairman Njodzi Machirori said here
today.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''the indications are that the demand is going to exceed
supply this year given the situation in Europe among the cigarette
manufacturers.''
</P>
<P>
He added there were chances the highest ever price of 1991 of 305
US cents per kilogram would be realised this year.
</P>
<P>
Last year's crop fetched an average 294 US cents per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is a major producer of tobacco in the world. enditem

<HEADLINE> Cameroun: Economic Operators Educated on Fiscal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The administration of North West
Province of Cameroun has warned that ignorance of fiscal obligations
would no longer be tolerated as an excuse for not paying taxes
regularly, the local paper "Cameroun Tribune" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The warning was made by Mbamba Firam, the Economic Adviser to
North West governor, during a meeting held in the provincial
capital Bamenda recently, aimed at educating and sensitizing
economic operators in Bamenda on their rights and obligations in the
payment of taxes.
</P>
<P>
Organised by the Provincial Center for Taxation in Bamenda, the
meeting also acquainted the economic operators with recent changes
in assessment systems.
</P>
<P>
The economic adviser decried the poor tax returns in the
province, saying they do not reflect the potentials of the
province. Mbamba Firam upheld that the empty treasuries are an
indication that people are not couscious of their fiscal
obligations.
</P>
<P>
He said according to available statistics, regular tax payers
in the province represent about 60 percent while the irregular
ones represent 40 percent. Among the irregular ones, some make
insufficient declarations and some make no declarations at all.
</P>
<P>
The administrator pointed out that if economic operators become
conscious of their obligations and declare their taxes regularly,
the quota of tax contribution by the population to the budget would
be attained and even doubled. enditem

<P>
YAOUNDE, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The people in Bamenda, the
capital of North West Province of Cameroun, have been warned
against the use of fake and expired goods.
</P>
<P>
In a press release received in Yaounde today, Ndifor Akaagho,
the provincial delegate of industrial and commercial development,
stressed that the liberalisation of the nation's economy does not
mean that "sub-standard and poisonous goods" should be sold in
public.
</P>
<P>
Some unscrupulous business men and women have taken upon
themselves to sell expired goods including drugs in the markets.
The selling and buying of fake and expired items in Bamenda
markets is jeopardising commercial activities.
</P>
<P>
Such acts, the release states, are "criminal and must be
checked".
</P>
<P>
Against this background, a team will soon be on the field to
track down those involved in the business of selling fake and
expired goods.
</P>
<P>
A list of goods that are not expected in Bamenda markets was made
known to the public. Such goods will be confiscated and destroyed.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) said here today that
the international community should preserve and improve the
environment for developing countries to participate in the world
economic and social globalization and regionalization process
effectively.
</P>
<P>
In a report entitled "the Economic and Social Survey of Asia
and the Pacific 1997," ESCAP noted that the majority of the least
developed countries and the economies in transition in the region
have not yet been able to participate meaningfully in the process
due to lack of the minimum development requirement.
</P>
<P>
The present conditions in these countries, characterized by low
per capital income, domestic savings and investment, make it
unlikely for them to meet the requirement on their own or to avail
themselves of the benefits of globalization and regionalization,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
They will continue to need strong support in terms of official
development assistance for the foreseeable future, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
"A major way in which the international community can assist
developing countries' integration into the global economy is to
ensure full implementation of the Uruguay Round in respect of
market access for developing countries' export products," it said.
</P>
<P>
"In this context, particular mention should be made of textiles
and clothing,' the report stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian and Pacific region accounts for more than 40 percent
of world exports of clothing, and for many individual countries in
the region, textiles and clothing represent as much as a quarter
of manufactured exports," it added.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia,
South Korea and Thailand have been targeted for anti-dumping
actions by developed countries at one time or the other.
</P>
<P>
The use of anti-dumping measures as a protective device should
be strongly discouraged, particularly because many developing
countries may find it difficult to seek relief through costly
dispute settlement procedures, it said.
</P>
<P>
Some developed countries use their national laws to practise,
in effect, managed trade in order to secure a bilateral trade
balance, and such practices should be avoided, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Business Costs in Britain Fall in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The cost of doing business in
Britain fell steadily last year after sharp increases in 1994 and
1995 and is set to remain under tighter control, according to a
study published today.
</P>
<P>
The study by the Henley Center, an economic forecasting group,
said business costs, which include insurance, wages, property, raw
material, fuel, and banking and other charges, dropped by 1.2
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that lower raw material prices, falling bank
charges coupled with declining telecommunications costs largely
contributed to the fall.
</P>
<P>
But in the previous two years, business costs rose by about
five percent a year, well in excess of retail price inflation,
mainly due to higher raw material and fuel charges, which have
since been reversed by the strength of the pound.
</P>
<P>
The study forecast that technology, work patterns and
favorable trends in fuel, raw materials, banking and property
will keep the brake on costs for the rest of the decade.
</P>
<P>
It believed that the heat has gone out of the pay issue and
that a lower inflation rate will also have a powerful influence in
keeping business costs under control.

face-to-face talks, if they begin, will have to be a diplomat of
international standing, the spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
"These meetings will take place day in, day out and the
Secretary-General is expected to preside over them for a certain
period, but due to his other commitments he cannot be
continuously present," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman welcomed the ongoing preparatory efforts, which
will lead to face-to-face negotiations between Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, and
praised the U.N. for making coordinating efforts.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored proximity talks between the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot sides have entered the sixth week, during which
U.N. Resident Representative Gustave Feissel had bi-weekly
separate meeting with Clerides and Denktash in a bid to prepare
the ground for face-to-face negotiations, and to get the two
sides to adopt good-will gestures.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said today that no common ground had been found so
far on substantive issues like security, territorial adjustments
and displaced persons, adding that "all these matters are still
pending."
</P>
<P>
As regards the proximity talks, Clerides said "it is too
early to say at this stage whether we are now closer to direct
negotiations. I do not think we can say that for at least another
two to three weeks."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated that the National Council, the
President's top advisory body on the handling of the Cyprus
issue, which was made up of parliamentary party leaders, will
assess the situation and give the green light for the Greek
Cypriot side's participation in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a Greek
Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Jobless Figure Creates Doubts over Its Validity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The number of Britain's
unemployment continued to decline last month at 6.1 percent of the
workforce, but the official figure has aroused doubts over its
validity.
</P>
<P>
The headline unemployment level in March fell by 41,000 to 1.7
million, after adjusting for seasonal effects, its lowest level
for six and a half years, according to the Office for National
Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said the figure, which
measures only those unemployed who also claim benefit, masked a
significantly higher real jobless rate.
</P>
<P>
Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary challenged Brown to
say if a Labor government would change the basis of calculating
labor market statistics.
</P>
<P>
Professor Adrian Smith, president of the Royal Statistical
Society, said, no single figure of unemployment can "do justice to
the complexity of the labor market".
</P>
<P>
"Public concern over the validity of unemployment statistics
will not go away until the next government takes steps to improve
their basis," the professor added.
</P>
<P>
The Government figures are based on the record of those who
claim benefits for being out of work from Employment Service
Offices.
</P>
<P>
Since May 1979 these statistics have been altered as many as 32
times, most recently in October as a result of the replacement of
unemployment benefit by the more rigorously enforced job-seekers'
Allowance.
</P>
<P>
Even the Office for National Statistics acknowledged that the
headline rate continued to be distorted by last year's
introduction of the scheme.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the office said it was impossible to calculate
an underlying employment trend, although the fall in jobless over
the last six months clearly exceeded the 15,000-20,000 a month
recorded in mid-1996.
</P>
<P>
However, some of the economic observers here argued that the
figures issued by the Office for National Statistics are "too good
to be true".
</P>
<P>
Anne Green at the Institute for Employment Research at Warwick
University said: "The UK unemployment rate provides only a partial
picture of the extent of joblessness in the labor market."
</P>
<P>
The quarterly Labor Force Survey, which uses the International
Labor Organisation's definition of unemployment, estimates there
are an additional 2.549 million people in Britain who are not in
work.
</P>
<P>
Anne Green said "We need a much broader view than that provided
by the conventional definition of unemployment."
</P>
<P>
Employment researchers here suggest that Britain should have a
range of narrower and broader measures of unemployment and
underemployment as in the US where seven different categories are
used.

<HEADLINE> UK Pubic Borrowing Falls to 22.8 bn Pounds in 1996-97 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain's public finances improved
over the past financial year as the government borrowed 3.6
billion pounds (5.8 billion US dollars) less than the Treasury had
forecast, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
</P>
<P>
ONS figures showed that the gap between government spending and
receipts was 8.8 billion pounds (14.3 billion US dollars) in
March, against economists' expectation of a nine billion pounds
(14.6 billion US dollars) shortfall and a 9.5 billion pounds (15.4
billion US dollars) figure for the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
This took total government borrowing in the 1996-97 financial
year which ended last month to 22.8 billion pounds (36.9 billion
US dollars), below the Treasury's forecast of 26.4 billion pounds
(42.8 billion US dollars) and the 31.7 billion pounds (51.4
billion US dollars) deficit recorded the previous financial year.
</P>
<P>
The better than expected figures reflected a surge in
corporation tax and other revenues and tight control of spending
by government departments, the ONS said.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke seized on the
figures to claim that the Conservatives would balance the budget
by the end of the decade if re-elected.
</P>
<P>
"Today's excellent figures are further evidence of he healthy
state of Britain's public finances. We have the winning formula,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
However, economists said that the extra revenue was the result
of over-cautious or erroneous forecasts in the government's
estimates, not stronger economic growth, and the deficit was still
too high for this stage of the economic cycle.

BONN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and

defining a new security partnership between NATO and Russia would
be signed next month.
</P>
<P>
"On May 27 the treaty will be signed in Paris -- this means we

</P>
<P>
The charter aims to mollify Moscow over the eastwards expansion

of the charter is completed," Kohl said, adding that he was
"confident" that the charter could be completed by the May 27
deadline.

The remaining 10 percent comprised the most difficult aspect of

<HEADLINE> Ireland Aims to Clear Language Barrier in Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government is planning
to take concrete measures to change Ireland's status as the least
linguistic state within the European Union (EU) amid fears that
international companies needing of multi-lingual staff may decide
to locate elsewhere in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Ireland, whose economy is booming over the past few years, is
facing fierce competition for the first time from multilingual
Europeans arriving in their hundreds to work for the growing
number of multinational customer service setting up in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Launching a government initiative to increase the number of
Irish computer and language graduates, Irish Enterprise and
Employment Minister Richard Bruton was reported as saying
Wednesday: "We could be the victim of our own success in
attracting large numbers of blue-chip multinationals to Ireland."
</P>
<P>
Under the government plan, 1,000 language students will be
placed abroad for up to six months to improve their language skills
while an extra 1,000 language places will be created in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Around 3,300 people in Ireland are employed in the customer
service sector, which is dominated by multinational computer and
software manufacturers such as Gateway 2000, Microsoft and IBM,
and the number is expected to rise to 5,000 by 1999.
</P>
<P>
Industrial analysts said that unless Ireland can increase the
number of language graduates, new jobs will be snapped up by
foreign nationals who already represent an estimated 33 percent of
the multinational customer service workforce in the country.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Watch Closely Israel's Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat has been monitoring closely the
developments of the current political crisis in Israel, which
might change the course of peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat today received a half-hour update of the latest
developments in the so-called "Bar-On for Hebron" scandal, which
deeply implicated Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu who is
 facing police charges for fraud and breach of trust.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in Israel's history that a prime
minister has ever been charged by the police, and the
opposition is intensifying its campaign to bring down the
hardline Netanyahu government.
</P>
<P>
If the government steps down under the political pressure,
this would have tremendous implications on the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process, which has been deadlocked because of Israel's
hardline policies.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that if new elections are held in
Israel, the dovish Labor party would likely regain its power, and
bring the peace process back on track and proceed with it more
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
But Palestinian officials remained diplomatic and tight-lipped
about the scandal and its possible implications on the peace
process, terming it as "entirely Israel's internal matter."
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath told reporters that
he was uncertain about the possible impact of the Bar-On
affair over the peace process, but he admited that the PNA
was following the situation closely.
</P>
<P>
"It is a matter of entierly internal matter for the
Israelis. We do not see it fit for us to discuss it. But
I'm sure that it is a factor ... that must be seriously
considered in the coming few days," he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Ross Makes No Progress in Resuming Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East coordinator
Dennis Ross made no progress in resuming peace talks between the
Israelis and Palestinians after his meeting this afternoon with
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Ross met Netanyahu and briefed him on his meeting with
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat
Wednesday, but no progress has been reported, the report said,
adding that Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ross should return to Washington as there is no chance that
the peace talks with the Palestinians can resume at this time
because of the current political situation in Israel, the radio
quoted a government official as saying.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Israel Television reported that the police team
investigating the Bar-On Affair has recommended that Netanyahu
be indicted, charging him with fraud and breach of trust.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in the history of the Jewish state that
the police have recommended the indictment of a prime minister.
However, Netanyahu said that he has no intention of resigning.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who arrived here Wednesday in an effort to restart peace
negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians, met Netanyahu
Wednesday before traveling to Gaza for talks with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Ross is reportedly trying to hammer out a formula which will
get the two sides back to the negotiating table and end the
crisis which erupted with Israel's decision to start
construction of Jewish settlement on Har Homa in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
After a half-hour meeting with Netanyahu Wednesday, Ross said
that a way has to be found to put the peace process back on track
and to ensure that violence is not going to be part of it.
</P>
<P>
"We also have to find a way to move the process forward in a
way which ensures that the hopes of each side can be realized and
that we have a credible negotiating process," said Ross.
</P>
<P>
Ross and Netanyahu did not discuss the proposal to advance the
final status talks between the Israelis and Palestinians, or the
second pullback of the Israeli army in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made it clear to Ross at their Wednesday meeting
that only the cessation of terrorism would lead to the
resumption of the negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Stresses Importance of Peacekeeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
today underscored the importance of peacekeeping operations in
troubled parts of the world, saying the realisation of peace was
essential for governments to effectively deal with social problems
facing the people.
</P>
<P>
Officiating at the end of a three-week southern African regional
peacekeeping demonstration exercise, code-named exercise blue hungwe,
in Nyanga of east Zimbabwe, Mugabe said the role played by military
forces in conflict resolution was necessary for the attainment of
peace.
</P>
<P>
With the attainment of peace, he said, governments of the world
would be able to divert their resources from conflict resolution to
the provision of basic necessities of humanity such as health,
housing, food and education.
</P>
<P>
He spoke in support of the concept of joint military training
exercises for defence forces of southern African countries, saying
this was one way peace could be promoted and preserved in the region.
</P>
<P>
''Demonstration such as blue hungwe removes suspicion and
increases transparency. It builds confidence, mutual trust and
understanding among participating defence forces at both political
and professional levels,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said cooperation and co-existence among the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) nations had become extremely important
because the problems being faced had become so transnational that no
one nation could claim to have the ability and resources to deal with
them in isolation.
</P>
<P>
He suggested joint training operations for peacekeeping purposes
should be an annual event hosted on a rotational basis among southern
African countries in order to enhance the cooperation among the
defence forces of the region.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, the first large-scale multinational peacekeeping
operation in Africa, brought together 1,100 military personnel
from Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa,
Swaziland, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Vows to Remain in Power Despite Scandal (by Zhi Linfei) (I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu today vowed to remain in power despite his
alleged involvement in a political scandal and the opposition's
call for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a party rally at the Likud headquarters in Tel
Aviv, Netanyahu said he loved a good fight and was confident
that he would continue leading the country till the year 2000
and even beyond.
</P>
<P>
He told the gathering that he had received hundreds of calls
from his supporters to encourage him to go on leading the country
despite the political storm over his alleged role in a political
corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the state television Channel I revealed that
police investigators probing the so-called "Bar-On for Hebron"
scandal had recommended the state prosecution to charge
Netanyahu with breach of trust and fraud in appointing former
Jerusalem attorney Roni Bar-On as the attorney-general in
January.
</P>
<P>
Police investigators reportedly also recommended indicting
Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi, Prime Minister's Office
Director-General Avigdor Liberman and Shas party leader Aryeh
Deri, who allegedly pushed for the appointment of Bar-On in
order to gain from a plea bargain deal in his future bribery
trial.
</P>
<P>
Deri was said to have conditioned Shas support of the Hebron
agreement on Bar-On's appointment.
</P>
<P>
After three-month investigations, the police presented Tuesday
a 995-page report and recommendations to State Attorney Edada
Arbel and current Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein, who will
decide within the next few days whether to endorse the
recommendations or not.
</P>
<P>
The revelation about police indictment against Netanyahu has
caused a ripple throughout the political establishment and
shocked the public, because this is the first time in Israel's
history that a prime minister has ever been charged by the
police for corruption.

<P>
Netanyahu has been defending himself as innocent and blasting
the police recommendations against him for being
politically-motivated and intended to bring down his elected
government.
</P>
<P>
However, leading opposition parties Labor and Meretz
immediately demanded Netanyahu and his cabinet resign in order
to pave the way for new elections. Today, the Labor leadership
convened an urgent meeting in Tel Aviv to review the current
political crisis and the possibility of new elections.
</P>
<P>
Labor Party leader Shimon Peres said he believed the current
crisis would surely lead to new elections for there was no other
way out.
</P>
<P>
Leading contender for Labor leadership Ehud Barak called on
all citizens, lawmakers and media leaders to work to overcome
the "tough moment" facing the nation by toppling the Likud
government.
</P>
<P>
In signs indicating the deep trouble that Netanyahu was
in, one of his major ruling partner the Third Way party convened
an urgent meeting today to discuss the implications of the
police investigation.
</P>
<P>
Party leader and Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani
has declared earlier that he would leave the coalition if any
minister was connected to the Bar-On scandal.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, another major ruling partner Israel Ba'aliya party
will also hold a meeting on the current situation. Party leader
and Trade and Industry Minister Natan Sharansky has also said
his party would withdraw support to the current government if
anyone within it was indicted.
</P>
<P>
Likud officials did not conceal their fears about the two
partners' rebel against the Likud-led coalition to bring it
down.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said that even if the state prosecution
decided against indicting Netanyahu, serious damage has already
been inflicted on the current government and it is certain that
it can no longer function as usual.

WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The White House said on
Thursday that the United States would remain committed to Middle
East peace efforts despite an Israeli corruption scandal involving
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police on Wednesday recommended that Netanyahu be tried
for fraud and breach of trust. Netanyahu, facing indictment,
refused to resign as the prime minister, but he may be forced to

White House spokesman Mike McCurry, in answering a question

<P>
He said the emerging scandal is a "domestic legal matter that

<HEADLINE> UK's Major Allows MPs to Vote Freely on Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister John Major today
announced that he would allow members of parliament a "free vote"
on whether to join a European single currency in a bid to end
quarrels in his Conservative Party two weeks before the May 1
election.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in north-west England, Major said the free
vote was "almost certainly the right way to handle it."
</P>
<P>
His decision on the single currency issue, which has dogged his
efforts to unite his party for the past few years, was welcomed by
those Conservative MPs who are opposed to European integration.
</P>
<P>
Major admitted that he had little choice but to accept a free
vote as it would be hard to force MPs to vote for a single
currency if they opposed the project.
</P>
<P>
The shift over Europe came as Major fought to heal festering
divisions in his ruling party over Europe: the same issue that led
to his predecessor Margaret Thatcher being ousted as party leader
and prime minister seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
Major said it was "frustrating" that some members of his party
were "unwisely" stepping out of line, referring that two junior
ministers and some other candidates decided to campaign against a
single currency in defiance of government policy, which is to wait
and see if it is in Britain's interest to join.
</P>
<P>
But Major's move was criticized by the opposition Labor Party.
Labor's economics spokesman Gordon Brown said: "We now have a
leader who has lost control of his party."
</P>
<P>
"It is an astonishing admission by the Chancellor that on a
vital economic decision he was not even consulted," he added.

<HEADLINE> S. African Suggested to Fluoridate Drinking Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The South African Health
Department has recommended to start immediately to fluoridate all
South Africans' drinking water.
</P>
<P>
This program should begin in the major metropolitan areas, the
department said in its white paper on transformation of health
system released today.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, alternative methods of fluoridation
such as fluoride toothpaste and mouth rinses should be introduced
in schools.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Assures Signing of NATO Charter in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 17 (xinhua) -- Russian president Boris Yeltsin
assured the signing of NATO-Russia charter as expected in May
after talks with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today in the Black
Forest spa town of Baden-Baden.
</P>
<P>
"On May 27 the treaty will be signed in Paris -- this means we
must hurry," Yeltsin told a news conference after the one-day
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Kohl said he was "confident" that the charter would be
completed by the May 27 deadline. "Some 90 percent of the charter
is completed," he added, and the remaining part comprised the most
difficult aspect of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The charter, defining a new security partnership between NATO
and Russia, aims to clear the way for eastwards expansion of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Negotiations on the
charter stalled earlier due to serious differences.
</P>
<P>
However, the differences remains after the one-day meeting
between Yeltsin and Kohl. Yeltsin repeated Moscow's demand for a
binding pledge that NATO would not deploy troops or nuclear
weapons on the territory of new member states -- expected to
include the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland.
</P>
<P>
NATO has made clear that it is not willing to give eternal
guarantees regarding conventional forces, though it sees no need
to station nuclear weapons any closer to Russia.
</P>
<P>
According to it, concession on the issue would result in a
military alliance with two classes of members. NATO was built from
the very beginning on the doctrine that an attack on any one of its
16 members would be considered an attack on all.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the NATO issue, Yeltsin and Kohl also discussed the
German demand for return of art and cultural treasures seized by
former Soviet Union in 1945 in the defeated Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told reporters he had returned to Kohl 11 packages of
documents and letters from Walther Rathenau, who was assassinated
in June 1922 four months after becoming the foreign minister of
the Weimar Republic.
</P>
<P>
"One must take the first step to untie this knot and I have now
done this," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has showed his support for Germany's demand, but was
blocked by the Russian parliament which has repeatedly passed laws
that would declare the cultural treasures Russia's state property.
</P>
<P>
The about one million works of art, two million books and
ancient archives now are in the hands of Moscow, are reportedly
worth 65 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Among the objects are paintings by Monet, Degas, Renoire, El
Greco, Goya, Rembrandt and Rubens, as well as the legendary golden
treasure from Troy, unearthed by German archeologist Heinrich
Schliemann.
</P>
<P>
Russian culture minister Michail Schwydkoj earlier proposed
negotiations on the issue and said that it was a possible solution
to make the cultural treasures international.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also gave Kohl today a microfilm of the complete
documents from the former East German Communist Party's central
committee, as well as a list of things Moscow wanted back from
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said German President Roman Herzog would return to
Russia the first objects during his scheduled visit to Moscow in
September, but did not release further details of the list.
</P>
<P>
In the company of his wife Naina and daughter-adviser Tatjana,
Yeltsin arrived in Germany on Wednesday afternoon and will leave
Baden-Baden early Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president would also receive a "Man of the Year"
award from a German media group later today.

ATHENS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Greece and Estonia today signed
two agreements regarding reciprocal investments and marine
transport during the talks between visiting Estonian Foreign
Minister Toomas Ilves and his Greek counterpart Theodoros
Pangalosn.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the talks, Ilves, currently on an
official visit to Greece, described his talks here as
"particularly important," saying that the two countries shared the
"very close" views on the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Ilves, the first Estonian foreign minister to visit Greece,
stressed that his country's foreign policy centered efforts on
accession to the EU.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pangalos said that the Estonia satisfied all the
prerequisites for the EU membership.
</P>
<P>
The Greek minister also repeated Athens' position that all
Council of Europe member-states should be able to apply for
accession and with respect to those for which the European
Commission's opinion was positive, accession negotiations should
begin at the same time.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Special Envoy to Zaire
and the Great Lakes region Mahomed Sahnoun said today that South
Africa, especially President Nelson Mandela, has made an
important contribution in the Zairean peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
Sahnoun made the remarks at a joint press conference in Cape
Town with Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Aziz Pahad, while
announcing that Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel
leader Laurent Kabila may soon hold direct talks in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Following his talks with Kabila on Wednesday night and with
Mobutu's envoy Honore Ngbanda this week, Mandela earlier today
extended a formal invitation to Mobutu to meet Kabila in South
Africa "as soon as possible".
</P>
<P>
Sahnoun said the Zairean conflict with all its complexities
needed wide leadership in peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the Zairean warring parties had agreed to
negotiate after initially refusing to talk to each other "was
very much due to an efficient South African diplomacy and the
wisdom of President Nelson Mandela", added Sahnoun.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich to Pay Penalty with Loan from Dole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House Speaker Newt
Gingrich announced Thursday he would pay a 300,000-dollar penalty
with money lent him by retired Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich told the House he had a "moral obligation" to pay out
of personal funds and "therefore I have arranged to borrow the
money and to pay it back."
</P>
<P>
Gingrich admitted violating House rules last winter, said that
any other means of payment, such as soliciting donations from
supporters, "would simply be seen as one more politician shirking
his duty and one more example of failing to do the right thing."
</P>
<P>
Documents released by the speaker's office said Dole had agreed
to lend Gingrich the full 300,000 dollars -- to be repaid with 10
percent annual interest over eight years. No payments are required
until 2005.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich's office released a letter from leaders of the ethics
committee saying a personal loan was a "permissible option" for
making payment, and the specifics of the Dole loan "are currently
under review."
</P>
<P>
Democrats immediately raised questions about the loan, noting
that Dole, while not a lobbyist, recently joined a law firm that
engages in lobbying.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich met privately with the Republican rank and file to
inform them of his decision before heading to the House floor --
where he was reprimanded for violating House rules in a historic
vote in January.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Gingrich said the crux of the case against him
involved letters drafted by his lawyers that contained erroneous
information. Even so, he said, "I bear full responsibility for
them and I accept that responsibility."
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said it would have been legal to pay the sanction out
of campaign funds or by soliciting donations from political
supporters. He said he may yet file a lawsuit against lawyers who
prepared two documents that were crucial to his ethics case.
</P>
<P>
But he said he and his wife decided "whatever the consequences,
we had to do what was best, what was right, morally and
spiritually."
</P>
<P>
Gingrich has been plagued by ethics charges filed by Democrats
since he assumed the speakership in 1995. He admitted in December
1996 to violating House rules.
</P>
<P>
He said he had failed to seek proper legal advice on using
tax-exempt projects to advance his political goals and that
inaccurate statements "in my name and over my signature" had been
submitted to the ethics committee.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Over 500 Tanzanians have
received training under the Overseas Development Assistance (ODA)
of Britain since it started in 1994, acting British High
Commissioner Alan Jones said here today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a ceremony at the Technical College to
mark the end of the Scientific, Instrumentation Repair and
Maintenance Course.
</P>
<P>
The course was particularly beneficial for a wide range of
Tanzania's institutions and bodies which had their representation
at the course, said Jones.
</P>
<P>
"This particular course is one of the 21 funded by ODA in
Tanzania training program since 1994, In 1996/97, the program
received over 570,000 of funding with the British Council being
deeply involved in the organization of the training," he said.
</P>
<P>
He handed at the ceremony over the equipment used in the
course to the Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Science,
Technology and Higher Education Abdallah Nogroro.
</P>
<P>
He said that the equipment will help the college in running
its practical programs effectively and in mounting short courses
for industry, both of which would have been impossible without
the equipment.
</P>
<P>
"Technical institutions strive for promotion of knowledge and
skills, especially the practical applications of scientific and
technical knowledge and skills at work places," he said
</P>
<P>
"As a result of rapid changes in the field of science and
technology, continuous interaction between technical institutions
and industry is very essential," he said.

NAIROBI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government today told
West embassies to Kenya to respect diplomatic protocol and raise
their concerns with the government instead of going public with
them.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here today, Kenyan Foreign Minister
Kalonzo Musyoka said that his government was gravely concerned
West embassies were returning to the confrontational style of
former U.S. Ambassador Smith Hempstone before Kenya's first

A joint statement signed on Wednesday by 14 West embassies
deplored recent actions by Kenyan police and called for free

The statement issued by the U.S. Embassy to Kenya said that
political leaders and candidates of all parties "must be accorded

The Kenyan minister said that it was normal practice for
foreign embassies to raise their concerns with the government.

WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Three former U.S. defense
secretaries today issued a joint statement, urging the Senate to
ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
</P>
<P>
Former defense secretaries William Perry, Harold Brown and
Eliott Richardson joined the current defense secretary, William
Cohen, in backing the treaty, which bans the development,
production, stockpiling, transfer and use of chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John
Shalikashvili reiterated his appeal to the Senate for ratifying
the convention.
</P>
<P>
"We firmly believe that U.S. ratification of the CWC will
contribute significantly to the security interests of the United
States and safety of our armed forces," said the three former
defense secretaries in the brief statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement released by the Pentagon said, "In light of the
decision under President Reagan to get rid of the vast majority of
U.S. chemical weapons stockpiles, it is in our interests to
require other nations to do the same."
</P>
<P>
The treaty, signed by 161 countries and ratified by 70 up to
now, will go into effect as of April 29 with or without the U.S.
ratification.
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the treaty led by Chairman Jesse Helms of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee insisted that the treaty needs
to be amended before ratification.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, four other former defense secretaries, --
Dick Cheney, Caspar Weinberger, Donald Rumsfeld and James
Schlesinger -- urged the Senate not to ratify the treaty, arguing
that the treaty is not in the interests of the U.S.

NEW YORK, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Compaq Computer Corporation,
the world's largest personal computer manufacturer, reported
Wednesday earnings of 387 million U.S. dollars in the first
quarter of this year, up 65 percent from 234 million dollars in
the comparable period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Apple Computer Inc.. reported a big loss. For its
most recent quarter, which ended on March 28, Apple reported a net
loss of 708 million dollars, compared with a deficit of 740
million dollars, according to a report of the New York Times
today.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, sales of Compaq rose 14
percent to 4.81 billion dollars from 4.21 billion dollars in the
first quarter of 1996, and for the second quarter, Apple's sales
fell 27 percent to 1.60 billion dollars in the same quarter of
last year, which was historically Apple's weakest.
</P>
<P>
With a growth rate nearly twice that of the personal computer
industry as a whole, the newspaper noted, Compaq is taking market
share from weaker competitors. The personal computer giant is also
reaping the rewards of its move to become a computer systems
producer, like L.B.M. or Hewlett-Packard, supplying severs and
networking technology in addition to personal computer.
</P>
<P>
And Apple is seeking a friendly buyer. Oracle Corporation is
considering a bid of more than 1 billion dollars to acquire
Apple. Now Apple has introduced new Power Mac models which is
considered a bright prospect for the company. The new model is
equipped with processor speeds up to 300 megahertz and new
Powerbook portables with chips as fast as 240 megahertz, faster
than anything offered by companies using the Intel Corporation's
microprocessors.

<HEADLINE> US Ex-Im Bank Pushes Commercial Aircraft Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Export-Import Bank
authorized 1.65 billion U.S. dollars in asset-based financing for
10 separate leases or sales of commercial aircraft in the first
half of fiscal year 1997, the bank announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The commercial airplanes were leased and sold by Boeing and
McDonnell Douglas to the emerging markets of the Czech Republic,
Egypt, India, Kenya, South Korea, Morocco, Turkey and Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
The bank also authorized a 105 million dollar long-term
guarantee for McDonnell Douglas MD-90 aircraft leases to China.
</P>
<P>
For the entire fiscal year 1996, the Ex-Im Bank's total
aircraft financing was some 1.25 billion dollars, and about 395
million dollars of this support was asset-based financing.
</P>
<P>
Asset-based financing, in which the aircraft serves as
collateral usually for a full-payout finance lease, is becoming
the most prevalent way of aircraft financing provided by the Ex-Im
Bank and other export credit agencies. Until the 1990s, most of
the bank's aircraft financing was in the form of a guarantee
backed by a sovereign guarantee from the buyer's government.
</P>
<P>
The bank is a government agency which finances and enhances the
exports of U.S. goods and services abroad.

West embassies to Kenya to respect diplomatic protocol and raise
their concerns with the government instead of going public with
them.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here today, Kenyan Foreign Minister
Kalonzo Musyoka said that his government was gravely concerned
West embassies were returning to the confrontational style of
former U.S. Ambassador Smith Hempstone before Kenya's first
multi-party elections in 1992.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement signed on Wednesday by 14 West embassies
deplored recent actions by Kenyan police and called for free
speech and assembly in the election year.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the U.S. Embassy to Kenya said that
political leaders and candidates of all parties "must be accorded
the opportunity to give the necessary information to their
electorate to enable them make choices when they exercise their
rights to vote."
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan minister said that it was normal practice for
foreign embassies to raise their concerns with the government.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that going public with the concerns amounted to a
challenge to Kenya's sovereignty, adding that "we cannot be seen
to compromise on national sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that his government did not intend
to suppress the opposition parties but the police force would
enforce the law.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Meets Egyptian Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) Li Ruihuan told Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
Ahmed El-Ganzouri here today that his visit to China will
vigorously push ahead the development of friendly cooperative
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the two countries have always enjoyed a good
relationship. Both China and Egypt are developing countries with a
long history of civilization. Both are faced with the challenges
of economic development and improvement of people's living
standards, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries hold identical or similar views
on many international issues. He expressed gratitude to
El-Ganzouri for Egypt's support to China on a number of crucial
issues, especially at the last session of the Human Rights
Commission of the United Nation that was held in Geneva this week.
</P>
<P>
El-Ganzouri said that the two countries have had similar
experiences in the past and maintained close relations through all
times. He said that the Egyptian people deeply feel that the
Chinese people are their sincere friend. Egypt will never forget
that China supported and helped it during hard times, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Sino-Egyptian relationship is an excellent
example of bilateral relations in the world.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the development of a long-term, steady and
friendly relationship of cooperation between the two countries is
not only in the interests of the two peoples, but also conducive
to the peace and stability of their own regions and the world as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
He said that contacts between the CPPCC and the Advisory
Council of Egypt have grown in the past few years. The enhancement
of exchanges between them will benefit the development of
bilateral relations and the improvement of the understanding
between the two peoples. Li said he hoped that the two sides will
continue their exchanges and cooperations at all levels and
further advance the existing friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
On the human rights issue, Li said that China respects the
norms of human rights acknowledged by the international community
and actively participates in human rights activities in the
international arena.
</P>
<P>
However, it believes that some specific human rights norms
should conform to the specific conditions in different countries,
otherwise these norms will become empty talks, he said.
</P>
<P>
China also holds that human rights find expression in the
course of history, which all countries are in, he said. Since the
conditions of different countries vary from one another, it is
natural that they have differences on the human rights
issue. China is firmly opposed to the practice of interfering in
other countries' internal affairs under the pretext of human
rights.
</P>
<P>
El-Ganzouri said that Egypt has made remarkable achievements in
its economic development, though it still has room to
improve. Egypt wishes to conduct fruitful cooperation with China,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China is delighted to see the improvement of
people's living standards in Egypt under the leadership of
President Muhammed Hosni Mubarak. He wished Egypt greater success
in its development. The two countries should learn from each other
in their economic development, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- An ink and brush painting by late
Pan Tianshou, a renowned contemporary traditional Chinese painter,
sold for 6.6 million yuan (800,000 US dollars), the highest price
at today's China Guardian '97 Spring Auction.
</P>
<P>
The painting, titled "Warm Water in Spring Pond" and featuring
an ox, rocks, streams, and wild flowers, is regarded as one of
Pan's best artworks.
</P>
<P>
At the bottom price of 2.6 million yuan and after over 30
rounds of competition, the painting was eventually bought at 6.6
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The China Guardian Auction Co., Ltd, put 282 modern Chinese
paintings and calligraphy on the auction block, selling 232 for
19.25 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
"Today's buyers of artworks have indicated that they are
increasingly eyeing modern paintings, even while some have cast
their eyes on the ancient paintings." said Gan Xueping, vice
president of The China Guardian Auction Co., Ltd.
</P>
<P>
But a picture of well-known contemporary painter Zhang Daqian,
which had been predicted to be well sold before the auction, was
not sold.
</P>
<P>
Hu Yanyan, who is in charge of the Chinese paintings and
calligraphy category from Guardian, explained that it was due to
domestic collectors' inadequate understanding of Zhang's artworks
in his late years, and that it was not appropriate to auction such
paintings now.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese president and Egyptian
prime minister agreed that China and Egypt are all-weather friends
during their talks held here today.
</P>
<P>
There are no conflicts in interest between China and Egypt,
only friendship and common wishes to strengthen bilateral
cooperation, said Chinese President Jiang Zemin when meeting with
visiting Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal Ahmed El-Ganzouri.
</P>
<P>
China is satisfied with the sustained, steady development of
Sino-Egyptian friendly cooperative ties which started some 40
years ago, said Jiang, calling the two countries "all-weather"
friends as their relations have stood the test of sweeping changes
in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
He said that as birthplaces of world civilization, both
China and Egypt have made significant contributions to the human
civilization and progress. The friendship between the two peoples
has experienced a long history.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the current international situation is still
facing complicated and profound changes, he said, the tendency
toward multi-polarity grows rapidly as does the quest for peace,
stability, and development.
</P>
<P>
The economic factor is playing an increasing role in
international relations. The world is expected to face a new era
of development.
</P>
<P>
However, the unjust and irrational international political and
economic order has not been changed fundamentally. The gap between
rich nations and poor nations continues to widen. Developing
countries are confronted with challenges as well as
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, developing countries should be more
unified and make concerted efforts to establish a more just and
rational international political and economic order, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President expressed China's willingness to
strengthen coordination and close cooperation with Egypt. China
wishes to make joint efforts with Egypt to establish long-term
friendly cooperative relations for the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian FM to Visit Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas will go to Oman and Kuwait next week on a tour of "oil
diplomacy", a Foreign Ministry official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "oil diplomacy" is based on the prediction that
oil resources in Indonesia would dry up within 10 to 20 years,
Ibrahim Yusuf, director of the African and Middle East Affairs
Department of the Foreign Ministry, said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia could not maintain its annual economic growth of
around 8 percent without adequate oil resources, said Yusuf, who
will accompany the foreign minister on his Middle East tour.
</P>
<P>
He said the Persia Gulf is still the biggest source of oil and
gas in the world. The eight Gulf countries including Oman and
Kuwait produce 18.56 million barrel of oil per day or 25 percent
of the world's total oil production.
</P>
<P>
During his visit in Oman and Kuwait from April 21 to 25, Alatas
is expected to have talks with government officials of the two
countries on matters of mutual concern, especially bilateral
relations, Yusuf said.
</P>
<P>
Alatas will also sign several agreements on energy cooperation
and other matters with the two countries, said Yusuf.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in March this year, Alatas visited Qatar and the
United Arab Emirates for strengthening bilateral ties and trade,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Tung on Proposed Amendments to Two Ordinances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Tung Chee Hwa today
made clear his major considerations concerning the proposed
amendments to the Societies Ordinance and the Public Order
Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Tung's office published the Civil Liberties and
Social Order Consultation Document, to solicit public opinions
over the proposed amendments to the two ordinances.
</P>
<P>
The first consideration is that the amendments will be in
compliance with the Basic Law and the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), he told a press conference
held at his office.
</P>
<P>
Another consideration is that the many freedoms existing in the
territory will be maintained after the handover, including
freedoms of procession, assembly and speech, as these are part of
Hong Kong's culture and are among the few factors contributing to
Hong Kong's success.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he expected the local community to reach
consensus that Hong Kong's political organizations and directions
should be clear of foreign influences as this is critical to the
territory's stability.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's interference in local political development is also
prohibited, he emphasized, although he expected to see enhanced
links in the economic, cultural and personnel exchanges between
the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan after July 1.
</P>
<P>
"Many countries in the world are very sensitive about foreign
political influences affecting their political thinking, and if
you look very carefully at the law of the United States on this
sort of matters, you will find the law there is much more
restrictive than what we are proposing here today," Tung
explained.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the Public Order Ordinance, he expected a balance to
be struck between the rights of the individual and social order.
</P>
<P>
He noted that many famous cities in North America and Asia
would not give up control over public order, and they have
stricter provisions in their laws than those being proposed to the
Public Order Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
Tung reassured that the amendments to the two ordinances are
"not directed against any particular persons or organizations."
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that the consultation process, scheduled to
last three weeks till April 30, is a genuine one.
</P>
<P>
Since the release of the document, he has met people from many
organizations and groups of the territory to listen to their
opinions about the proposed amendments, Tung said, while appealing
to the general public for their views.

<HEADLINE> Ashrawi: Settlement A Bomb Shell Against Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Hanan Ashrawi, Minister of Higher
Education in the Palestinian National Authority, has warned that
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem is a bomb shell against the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
In an interview printed in today's Bahraini newspaper "Akhbar
Al Khaleej", Ashrawi accused Israel of non-commitment to the
principles of the peace process and imposing a fait accompli on
the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
She asserted that violence was not coming from nowhere, and the
Palestinian side had warned the U.S. Administration against a new
wave of violence as a consequence of Israel's hardline policies.
</P>
<P>
She underscored that the U.S. use of veto power in the
U.N. Security Council meant that the Palestinians could not resort
to any thing other than violence.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi noted that there have been encouraging signs in the
Arab world ever since the convocation of the recent Arab foreign
ministers meeting in Cairo, but there ought to be a united Arab
strategy and strong political support for the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem was not a mere Palestinian issue, but an
Arab-Islamic-Christian one, she stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Minister appealed to the Arabs to use their
potential force, pointing out that "the present stage was the most
difficult one we and the Arab nation are experiencing."

<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The China Securities Regulatory

memorandum of understanding on securities regulation and
cooperation with its Malaysian counterpart.
</P>
<P>
"The signing of the memorandum paved the way for closer

regulators," said Zhou Daojiong, chairman of the CSRC.
</P>
<P>
Under the memorandum, the two sides will join hands in fields
such as regulatory information exchanges and personnel training.
</P>
<P>
Zhou also mentioned that the CSRC is looking forward to closer
cooperation with the international securities regulators, so as to
draw their advanced experience in the area and enhance its own
regulation of securities market.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the Securities Commission of Malaysia,
M. M. Abdul Majid, hailed the signing of the memorandum as "a
recognition of the need for the two regulatory organizations in
the development and regulation of our capital markets."
</P>
<P>
He also noted that a closer cooperation between the two sides
is "in anticipation of the needs of the securities investors in
China and Malaysia, and will safeguard mutual investment in the

<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of China's
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, met here this
afternoon with visiting Juan Adolfo Singer, president of the Latin
American Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders expressed the hope for continuous growth of
friendly ties between the NPC and the Latin American Parliament by
concerted efforts.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi said China's NPC has maintained close contacts and
good cooperation relations with most member states of the Latin
American Parliament. Such relationships have been enhanced over
the past few years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said: "I have visited Argentina, Brazil, and Cuba. When
the 96th Inter-parliamentary Conference was held in Beijing last
September, I had the opportunity to exchange views with leading
members of delegations from the parliaments of the Latin American
countries."
</P>
<P>
Qiao said the contact between the NPC and parliaments of the
Latin American countries and the Latin American Parliament has
increased their mutual understanding, trust, and friendship and
promoted their mutually beneficial cooperation in every field.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that with concerted efforts, such
exchanges and cooperation will be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that China is now concentrating on its modernization
drive so as to eliminate its backwardness.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, to thoroughly change backwardness requires
efforts by several generations.
</P>
<P>
Singer said China constitutes an important factor for
safeguarding stability in the world and its status in the
world today has been becoming increasingly important.
</P>
<P>
"It is our priority objective to develop our ties with
China. We are willing to establish a long-term and friendly
cooperative mechanism with China's NPC," he said.
</P>
<P>
Singer noted China's great progress and its efforts to
eliminate poverty. Latin America is also confronted with issues
similar to China.
</P>
<P>
The Latin American countries are far from China, but their
cooperation has been becoming increasingly closer. Their relations
should be developed further in the political, economic, and
cultural aspects, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi's wife Yu Wen attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Singer and his party arrived here on April 16 at the invitation

<P>
HARARE, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A three-week southern African
regional peacekeeping demonstration exercise, which ended on
Thursday in Zimbabwe, was described as a new move for promoting
and preserving peace in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, code-named Blue Hungwe, the first joint
peacekeeping training exercise in Africa, was designed to equip
the forces from the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
with UN peacekeeping doctrines, command procedures and
strategies.
</P>
<P>
The operation came against the background of the need for an
African peacekeeping force following the hurdled mission in
Somalia which saw multi-national forces withdrawing from the Horn
of Africa country without fulfilling the UN mandate.
</P>
<P>
The exercise brought together about 1,700 troops, military
observers and civilian police from eight SADC countries and a
number of international non-governmental organizations, the
International Committee of the Red Cross and other humanitarian
agencies.
</P>
<P>
Jointly sponsored by the Zimbabwe national army (ZNA) and the
British government at a cost of over 900,000 US Dollars, the
exercise was in three phases coded Blue Jesa, Tsuro and Ijuba.
</P>
<P>
Briefing journalists at a border camp in Nyanga, Zimbabwe,
Director of the exercise ZNA Major-General Mike Nyambuya, who
served as UN deputy forces commander during the Somalia mission,
said that "the fact that we have been able to come together and
train as a region is a major achievement on its own. We have
created and enhanced the inter-operability of forces from SADC."
</P>
<P>
The SADC forces had during the exercise, said Nyambuya,
managed to establish a peacekeeping modus operating among
themselves and the UN relief agencies on the basis of "solid
working relations" which could be used in the future.
</P>
<P>
British military advisory training team commander, Brigadier
Adrian Naughten, also said the joint military training and
peacekeeping exercise had proved that the region's forces could
work and live together without problems, adding that "we were
simulating real war situation as much as possible, but within the
bounds of safety. There were no casualties or injuries."
</P>
<P>
Although there were no plans yet to establish a permanent
peacekeeping force in the region, the exercise would make it much
easier for the mobilization of regional forces in the event that
their services were needed.
</P>
<P>
The exercise has also helped in standardizing operation
procedures of forces in the region. It also helped bring
stability in the region through interaction of forces from
different countries.
</P>
<P>
The operation was expected to enhance African peacekeeping
capability, sub-regional cooperation and military skills by way
of a multi-national joint field training exercise in the tactics
and techniques of peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
Local observers held, by the time the series of exercises are
over, there should be a solid cadre of officers and men from most
of the SADC armies able to work together and trained to cope with
peacekeeping duties.
</P>
<P>
But the matter should not stop at a series of exercises, said
the observers, adding that the SADC military leadership should be
tasked by their civilian leaderships to work out plans to have
units assigned in permanent near readiness for deployment
anywhere in the region.
</P>
<P>
Such a force does not need to be kept assembled in one
place. That would be an unnecessary expense. But each country
could be invited to have the required types of unit available for
deployment on a few days notice and a small permanent military
co-ordination committee could keep in regular contact and have
prepared the necessary contingency plans.
</P>
<P>
The same philosophy applied to the military sector would cost
little but ensure the region could cope with emergencies, they
said.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that one major problem that most countries of
southern Africa could face if a regional peacekeeping force was
deployed would be the logistics.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that the exercise should be the start of a new
role for SADC members, and the military and political leadership
should build on the successes of the exercise and ensure that if
ever the worse came to the worst, southern Africa would be ready
to cope.

<HEADLINE> Poll Makes Final at World Short-Course Swimming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GOTHENBURG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Olympic Champion Claudia Poll
of Costa Rica took off with a flying start at the World
Short-course Swimming Championships here as she won the 200 meters
freestyle heat on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 1.91-meter freestyler from the tiny South American nation,
double gold medallist at the 1995 World Short-course Championships
in Rio de Janeiro, led the way throughout and touched the pad with
a winning time of one minute 57.90 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Poll, who claimed the first Olympic gold for her country in the
200m freestyle at the Centennial Olympic Games in Atlanta last
summer, showed the absolute advantage in her speciality, beating
her closest opponent Martina Moravcova of Slovakia, 1995 bronze
medalist, by nearly half a second.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cuba's Rodolfo Falcon failed to enter the final in
his defense of the men's 200 meters backstroke title, managing
only the 19th-fastest overall time of 2:00.46.
</P>
<P>
China's Wang Wei clocked fastest time of 1:55.13 to become the
event's top qualifier.
</P>
<P>
Another Chinese swimmer Lu Donghua led the way in 59.94,
winning the women's 100m back heat, ahead of Germany's Olympic
silver medalist Sandra Voelker and American defending champion
Misty Hyman.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Voelker lowered her own European 50 meters freestyle
short-course record with 24.62, becoming the top finisher in the
qualifying session.
</P>
<P>
World record-holder of the event Le Jingyi of China,
third-finisher in Thursday's 100m freestyle, was third in the heat
overall, behind Jenny Thompson of the United States.

<HEADLINE> China's National Economy Grows steadily (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China's national economy reported
a smooth growth in the first quarter this year, showing a sound
development trend following its "soft landing" 1996, a senior
official with the State Statistical Bureau (SSB) said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here, Ye Zhen, spokesman for SSB,
said that the bureau's preliminary estimates show that China's GDP
reached 1,468.6 billion yuan, representing a year-on-year increase
of 9.4 percent in real terms.
</P>
<P>
Such an increase margin is 0.8 percentage points lower than in
the same period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the figures of the corresponding period of 1996,
the increases of the country's primary, secondary, and tertiary
industries were five percent, 10.6 percent and 8.3 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Ye said that the agricultural sector was off to a good start in
the first quarter, as the SSB survey on the planting intentions of
40,000 farmer families showed that the crop planting acreage will
reach 153 million ha this year, up 10.5 percent over the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
The acreage planted with cereal crops will be 400,000 ha more
than that of last year, hitting 110 million ha in total.
</P>
<P>
He said that a good harvest of summer grain crops is expected,
as long as no severe natural disaster occurs in the country.
</P>
<P>
In the January-March period, the industrial sector reported a
steady growth, with all the enterprises above county level
generating an added value of 452.5 billion yuan, a year-on-year
growth of 11 percent. This increased margin is 2.6 percentage
points down from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The sale-to-production ratio edged up, registering an average
of 93.96 percent in the country during the first quarter.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Alerts Army to Conspiracies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani today called on the armed forces to be on alert
against "international conspiracies."
</P>
<P>
Marking the Army day here, he said that the military should
maintain their combat readiness in light of "many conspiracies
by the international camp of unbelievers against the country."
</P>
<P>
He cited the Berlin court ruling that the Iranian leadership
was behind the 1992 killings of Kurdish dissidents as a joint
conspiracy by the United States, Israel and the German judiciary
against the Islamic republic.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not pointed his finger directly at the German
government today in his statement.
</P>
<P>
He said the foreign enemies of Iran had considered at least
three devices for crippling the Islamic republic shortly after
the triumph of the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
One device, he said, was to replace former officials with
their own elements here in which they failed. The second one was
a military coup which was discovered and aborted, and the third
one was the imposition of a war on Iran with the involvement of
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Tehran believed that the U.S. is now spearheading a worldwide
effort to further isolate the Islamic republic and to serve the
purpose military means may also be possibly explored.
</P>
<P>
Be prepared for possible warfare, the Iranian authorities have
raised the country's military budget about 40 percent in the new
fiscal year starting from March 21 over that of last year.
</P>
<P>
Some 25 billion rials (8.3 million U.S. dollars) have been
earmarked for upgrading the country's defense capacity, according
to local press reports.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Clubs To Compete in European Champions' League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Two Turkish clubs will be eligible
to compete in the expanded European Champions' League next season,
UEFA announced here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The decision means that Greece will have only one team in the
competition.
</P>
<P>
According to the UEFA regulations, the top eight countries in
rankings in Europe can each field two teams in the competitons,
one seeded and one entering the qualifying rounds.
</P>
<P>
Countries ranked ninth to 16th can field one team in the
Champions' League.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece were level in eighth place on the rankings,
which is based on points gained in European club competitions over
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
UEFA used a tie-break method of taking this season's
co-efficient points into consideration and on that basis Turkey
had 7.75 points and Greece 3.75.
</P>
<P>
The competition is used as a qualifying tournament for the UEFA
Cup.

<HEADLINE> China's National Economy Grows Steadily (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to Ye, investment in fixed assets stood at 147.8
billion yuan, up 13.9 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Consumer goods maintained a balance between supply and
demand. Retail sales of consumer goods shot up 15.5 percent over
1996, at 663.3 billion yuan. When adjusted for inflation rate, the
real increase is 12.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that, in contrast to slack foreign trade of
the January-March period of 1996, exports scored rapid growth in
the first quarter, thanks to the brisk international market.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, in the first quarter, imports and
exports totaled 64.3 billion US dollars, up 11.6 percent over the
same period of last year. Exports amounted to 33.5 billion
dollars, up 25.7 percent, but imports inched down 1.8 percent to
28.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Retail prices inched up 2.6 percent, comparing with the same
period of last year; and consumer prices went up by 5.2 percent on
average in the first quarter. The inflation rate showed a monthly
decline, and reached the lowest point in March, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
Per capita income of urban residents was 1,446 yuan,
representing a real increase of only 1.2 percent over the same
period of last year. Farmers' income was 564 yuan per person, an
increase of 1.5 percent in real terms.
</P>
<P>
Ye said that, although the national economy maintained its
healthy growth, bottlenecks like the irrational industrial
structure and increasing losses of the state-owned sector were
far from solved.
</P>
<P>
The government should improve its regulation of the economy and
its role in "fine tuning" the economy to continue the healthy
economic development marked by high growth and low inflation, he
said.

<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
met here today with a delegation from the Foreign Affairs and
Human Rights Committee of the Nepalese parliament, led by the
Committee Chairman Jaya Prakash Prasad Anand.
</P>
<P>
Describing China and Nepal as good neighbors, Li said that
friendly exchanges between the people of the two countries date
back to ancient times.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the leaders of the two countries have had
frequent exchanges of visits in recent years, which has promoted
friendship between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Nepalese friendship has stood the test of time, he said,
setting a fine example for friendly co-existence between countries
with different social systems.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to develop its cooperative relations with
Nepal on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence.
</P>
<P>
Li also highly appreciated the "one China" stance observed by
all the previous Nepalese governments, and expressed thanks to
Nepal for its support to China on the issues of Tibet, Taiwan, and
human rights.
</P>
<P>
"We agree to engage in friendly dialogues on an equal footing
in human rights issue, but never agree that human rights issue can
be used to interfere in other countries' internal affairs," he
noted, "For developing nations, top priority should be given to
the rights of survival and development."
</P>
<P>
Li also briefed the Nepalese visitors on China's achievements
since it began its reform and opening-up policy in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Anand said that bilateral relations have always grown smoothly,
and cooperation between the two countries in various areas has
progressed.
</P>
<P>
Anand reiterated that the Nepalese government never allows
anyone to participate in activities aimed at splitting China in
Nepalese territories, and will continue to follow its "one China"
policy.
</P>
<P>
Nepal is ready to cooperate with China in the human rights
area, Anand said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Tung Chee Hwa today
urged the Hong Kong government to cooperate with his team in
laying out the post-handover law on the right of abode issue.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference at his office, Tung confessed that
drafting the bill, which is among those things his office must do
before July 1, is not an easy job.
</P>
<P>
So he hoped that the Hong Kong government, which has
"repeatedly pledged support and cooperation after he was elected
Chief Executive," would lend a hand in this respect in the
interests of the 6 million Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
With the Hong Kong government's help, his office could do
better and more smoothly and avoid possible mistakes in drafting
the law.
</P>
<P>
However, the chief executive pointed out, if the Hong Kong
government refuses to change its mind, his team will work on their
own and try their best to draft the legislation.
</P>
<P>
The draft bill will be then submitted to the Provisional
Legislative Council (PLC), the legislative arm of the HKSAR, for
passage before July 1.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference which lasted some forty minutes, Tung
also answered questions on the consultation document his office
released last week on the amendments to the Societies Ordinance
and the Public Order Ordinance.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister on China-ASEAN Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The third political consultation
between senior officials from China and the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) concluded here today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan Thursday told
reporters that the two sides discussed specific proposals for the
development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Tang described the consultations as friendly and harmonious,
adding that common understanding and cooperation were the focus of
the consultations.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN is pleased with China's economic achievements, and
hopes that the China will continue to play an important role in
ensuring regional stability and development, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
China supports the ASEAN's efforts to raise regional
cooperation, and is ready to enhance coordination with the ASEAN,
Tang continued.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that China's counterparts were briefed on China's
principled stance on the country's peaceful reunification, its
opposition to Taiwan's independence, and the Hong Kong issue, and
expressed thanks to the ASEAN countries for their understanding
and support to China in the human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN reaffirmed that it will adhere to the "one China"
policy, Tang said, regarding China's resumption of its exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1 as an end to its colonial
history and demonstrating Asian revitalization.
</P>
<P>
Tang noted that the ASEAN countries extended congratulations to
China for its foiling for the seventh time an anti-China draft
resolution on the human rights issue proposed by some Western
countries.
</P>
<P>
On existing differences concerning borders and territories
between China and some ASEAN nations, Tang said that the Chinese
side reiterated its position, and that the two sides expressed the
will to maintain regional peace and stability, and that it is
imperative to handle differences through negotiations in order to
seek a proper settlement, not allow the differences to interfere
in the normal development of relations between countries.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also exchanged views on international and regional
situations, as well as upcoming dialogues between Chinese and
ASEAN foreign ministers in July.
</P>
<P>
The consultations proceeded smoothly in a wide range of areas,
Tang noted, providing easy access for the two sides in promoting
ties.
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances of a global multipolar trend, he said,
the two sides have achieved a remarkable progress in their
relationship in recent years, and bilateral ties have entered a
new era marked by a long-standing stability and more maturity, on
the basis of their common understanding that as developing
countries, China and the ASEAN nations face the same task of
advancing their respective economies, and show their strong
willingness to safeguard peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
As the ASEAN countries are China's neighbors, he noted, China
places importance on its friendly cooperation with the
association, and cites it as an important part of the country's
good-neighbor foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides hold that they should promote bilateral cooperation
in all fields, to establish a neighborly partnership toward the
21st century based on equality, mutual benefit, and trust, beyond
their specific and temporary differences," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Tang also said that China attaches importance to the role
played by the ASEAN in regional affairs, and that in the post-Cold
War, the ASEAN has become an active, influential organization in
the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
"We speak highly of the achievements made by the organization,
and support the ASEAN's development," he said, "This not only
conforms to a global multipolar trend, but benefits long-term
peace and development in the Asia-Pacific region."

<P>
MOGADISHU, April 18 (Xinhua)-- About 100 farms in the Lower
Shabelle Region of southern Somalia were destroyed yesterday by
floods from the Shabelle River.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the region said the floods crushed the flowering
farms of maize, sorghum and sesames at Bulo Marer and Jerow
villages 120 km south of here. The floods also destroyed a large
grazing land for animals.
</P>
<P>
The reports said people in Bulo Marer today began to push the
water aside with sand carried in buckets and wheelbarrows.
</P>
<P>
According to the elders of the Bulo Marer Village, they
tried to contact the relief agencies in the region but did not
get any answer.
</P>
<P>
The elders said they are appealing to the international aid
agencies elsewhere in the country to help them stop the water.
</P>
<P>
Similar floods hit some farming areas in the Middle Shabelle
Region last November when the Shabelle River crushed its
banks. enditem

<HEADLINE> Chemical Warfare Victims Urged to End Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian authorities today called
on the chemical warfare victims to end their on-going strike and
leave the case with the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Rowhani, Vice-Speaker of the Parliament and secretary of
the Supreme National Security Council, assured the war veterans
disabled by chemical poisons that the Parliament would deal with
their grievance.
</P>
<P>
The vice-speaker said that the legislature would adopt
necessary measures against the 24 German companies which supplied
chemical weapons to Iraq during the eight-year war with Iran in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 chemical warfare victims and their families
have staged a sit-in in front of the German Embassy since
Wednesday and they vowed to continue the protest until
their demands for actions against the German officials and firms
were met.
</P>
<P>
They condemned the ruling of the Berlin court that the Iranian
leadership was behind the 1992 killings of four Kurdish
dissidents, and demanded an official German apology to the Iranian
nation.
</P>
<P>
Iran claimed that a total of 118 war veterans wounded in Iraqi
chemical attacks have died since 1991 and thousands of war
victims are suffering from severe injuries sustained from the
Iraqi chemical warfare during 1980-1988.
</P>
<P>
Hamid Sohrab-Pur, head of the Center for Victims of Chemical
Warfare, said that his center has so far obtained medical records
of 60,000 out of an estimated 100,000 chemically wounded.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, 1,500 of such people living in various
parts of the country need constant medication.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that those behind such crimes have been
identified and that the center holds a list of German companies
responsible for the chemical warfare.
</P>
<P>
He said that his center has already cooperated with German
medical centers for treatment to the disabled Iranians.
</P>
<P>
The German physicians treating the victims are expected to shed
light on the realities, but none of them was available for comment
so far.
</P>
<P>
By persuading the disabled to end their protest, Iran seemed to
intend to show its willingness to come down from a political
crisis with Germany, its largest European trade partner, after
several days of anti-German demonstrations throughout the country
this week.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that Tehran would not like to go too far in
relations with Germany in particular and the European Union as a
whole after ambassadors were recalled from each other's capitals.
</P>
<P>
As the U.S.is still striving to isolate Iran, the Islamic republic
would play into the hands of Washington if it goes to sever ties
with the European countries. Berlin, while defending the court
verdict from Tehran accusations, has also tried to distance
itself from the U.S. drive.

<HEADLINE> Warm Weather Prompts Early Appearance of UK's Butterflies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The warm weather has speeded up
the development of butterflies to such an extent that many species
are on the wing more than a month earlier, a report by the British
Butterfly Conservation said here today.
</P>
<P>
Nigel Bourn, an authority, said, "It's incredibly early for
butterflies. They are cold-blooded and are dependent on
temperatures to develop."
</P>
<P>
When it is this warm and this early they will develop very
quickly. It's always difficult to be absolutely sure if it's a
record but they are on the wing earlier than at any time in living
memory, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ecologists and regional recorders from the charity have noted
that it is not only one individual butterfly being sighted. They
are being reported in considerable numbers.
</P>
<P>
Dr Warren said butterflies were good indicators of global
climate changes. A recent northward spread of species, such as the
gatekeeper and speckled wood and the current early appearances,
was a good witness, he added.

<HEADLINE> Mobutu-Kabila Peace Talks Likely in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The long-awaited peace
talks between Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader
Laurent Kabila is likely to take place in South Africa early next
week.
</P>
<P>
At a media briefing in Cape Town, presidential spokesman Parks
Mankahlana made it clear that Mobutu had received an invitation
from South African President Nelson Mandela, a major mediator of
the Zairean civil war, through his special envoy Honore Nganda.
</P>
<P>
Following his talks with Kabila Wednesday night and
discussions with Ngbanda later on, Mandela on Thursday extended a
formal invitation to Mobutu to meet Kabila in South Africa "as
soon as possible".
</P>
<P>
Ngbanda left Cape Town for Kinshasa, capital of Zaire, on
Thursday to deliver Mandela's invitation to Mobutu, and a
response was expected later today, said a South African
government source.
</P>
<P>
Although it has not yet been decided where the proposed talks
will take place, Cape Town is a likely venue.
</P>
<P>
In Zairean capital of Kinshasa, President Mobutu's son and
spokesman, Nzanga Mobutu, confirmed on Thursday that his
66-year-old father now was willing to meet the rebel leader,
but adding that the president refused to step down.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, United Nations special envoy on the Zairean crisis,
Mohammed Sahnoun, said on Thursday that the ultimate goal of a
direct meeting between Mobutu and Kabila would be to organize the
terms for elections.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Cape Town, where Mandela's meeting with Kabila
took place, Sahnoun said both sides had agreed to meet with no
preconditions.
</P>
<P>
The rebel forces led by Kabila, have now controlled over a
half of Zaire's territory, and are still pushing forward with
capital Kinshasa as their final target.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Riot Breaks Out in Nigeria's Oil City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Fresh riot broke out in southern
Nigeria's oil city Warri on Thursday, with youths from two ethnic
groups exchanging gun fire on the street.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said today that one of the combatants were
confirmed killed in the shootout, while a major market and a
police station were torched in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Women market peddlers were caught between the warring youths
and the policemen who came to arrest the situation.
</P>
<P>
Tear gases were fired by the police, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts in Warri started about a months ago, following
the relocation of the South-West local government headquarters
from the Ijaw community to the Itsekiri community.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts between the Ijaw and the Itsekiri people have
led to the death of at least 44 people so far and caused a huge
loss to the oil companies operating in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Delta State Government had called in the federal navy
force and imposed a curfew to restore peace in the city, but had
failed to solve the disputes between the tribes.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's trouble started when the Itsekiris found on the
roadside of the body of an Itsekiri chief's son. They then
stormed the Dawudu Police Station, saying that the police had
failed to protect them during earlier Ijaw attacks.

<HEADLINE> Constraints Should Be Eased to Sustain Growth: ESCAP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The fast-growing economies in the
Asian and Pacific region should overcome those constraints
emerging over the past years to sustain growth in the long run, a
survey said.
</P>
<P>
Some difficulties, like shortages of skills and expertise,
rising labor costs, structural and infrastructural bottlenecks,
are surfacing in these economies which displayed considerable
dynamism in the past years, according to the Economic and Social
Survey for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) 1997.
</P>
<P>
These problems are attributing to their economic slowdown
recently and affecting their export competitiveness in the world,
said the survey released by the ESCAP on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The problems also caused speculation on whether the slowdown is
a temporary downturn or a permanent structural feature in these
economies, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
To overcome these difficulties, the economies in the region are
introducing programs to enhance education for people, step up
research and development to upgrade technology, and improve
essential infrastructures, such as power, transport and
communication, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The private sectors in the region also are stepping up their
efforts to train their workforce, upgrade technology, raise
productivity and reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
A gradual shift to more skill and technology intensive growth
has emerged as a core development strategy in the region with the
basic aim to maintain or enhance international competitiveness and
sustain the fast-growing status, it said.
</P>
<P>
With these measures being made or introduced, the ESCAP
projected that economies such as Thailand could grow at rates
ranging between 7 and 10 percent until 2000.
</P>
<P>
The rates are high enough to enable Thailand to double its
gross domestic product within 7 to 10 years, it added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Academic Accuses U.S. Authors of Fabricating Quotes  (Part One) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese academic has
accused two U.S. authors of fabricating quotes in their recently
published book on Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Mi Zhenyu's article, entitled "Foolish Lies -- A Comment on
'The Coming Conflict With China,'" was published by the Chinese
press today. The full text of the article reads as follows:
</P>
<P>
I have recently read the book "The Coming Conflict With
China" written by Richard Bernstein and Ross H. Munro, former
Beijing-based foreign correspondents for Time magazine and the
Toronto Globe and Mail respectively.
</P>
<P>
What shocked me is that the authors' headline quotation in the
book's introduction quoted remarks attributed to me that I have
never made. The quote said, "(As for the United States) for a
relatively long time it will be absolutely necessary that we
quietly nurse our sense of vengeance... We must conceal our
abilities and bide our time." (The ellipsis existed in the
original quote.) The authors of the book did not provide the
exact source of their quote but just said "in a widely published
1996 collection of essays by several Chinese officials." Among
the books published in China in 1996, only one book, "Megatrends
China," published by Hua Ling Publishing House, carried one of my
articles called "China's Strategic Policy on Positive Defense."
</P>
<P>
In my article, I elaborated the theory that China's military
strategic policy can only be one of "active defense," determined
by the nature of the country, its social system, basic domestic
and foreign policies, and the tasks of its armed forces, as
stipulated in the Chinese Constitution.
</P>
<P>
China's military strategy is subordinate to and serves the
basic policy of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the
constitution, which defines that the nature of the nation's
military strategic policy is one of self-defense and defense.
</P>
<P>
I also pointed out in the article that China advocates avoiding
and stopping war, and settling international disputes and issues
left over from history by peaceful means instead of resorting to
war, and that preventing war constitutes an important part of the
strategic policy of active defense in the new era.
</P>
<P>
I didn't mention the United States anywhere in the article, nor
did I say anything similar to that quoted in the U.S. book.
</P>
<P>
If the two authors of the book think I said what they quoted on
some other occasions or in some other articles, then they should
show me the evidence. If not, the quote they attributed to me is
nothing but sheer fabrication.
</P>
<P>
It is hard to understand why the two authors turned a deaf ear
to the principles of "increasing mutual trust, reducing trouble,
developing cooperation and avoiding confrontation," which
President Jiang Zemin has stated repeatedly to guide Sino-U.S.
relations.
</P>
<P>
They are obsessed with using other people's names to invent
lies and to escalate the hostile atmosphere between China and the
United States, so as to deceive and mislead the world opinion.
</P>
<P>
To support the "China Threat" theory, the two authors turned
right and wrong upside down, confused black with white and made up
facts to support their views to vilify and demonize China's
politics, economy, diplomacy and human rights conditions. China's
defense and military policy was especially a primary target for
their vicious attack.

<HEADLINE> Qatari Emir Travels Abroad on Special Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU Dhabi, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad
bin Khalifa al Thani today left the Qatari capital Doha to
travel abroad on a "special" mission, the Qatari news Agency
said.
</P>
<P>
There was no word on the destination of the trip neither
were reasons given for his visit, but there was speculation in
Qatar that he is most likely to travel to Europe, where his old
father Khalifa bin Hamad al Thani, Qatar's former emir, is living
in exile.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad seized power in the tiny Gulf country in June
1995, when his father was vacationing in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The 47-year-old emir flew to Paris and Rome last December
after a three-day summit of Gulf Arab Countries to visit his
father to improve relations with him.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari government announced last year that the former emir
was welcome to return home, but only as the "father" of all
Qataris.
</P>
<P>
The visit coincided with Id al-Adha, a traditional muslim feast
which usually lasts three to four days. Before his departure, the
emir issued a decree to appoint Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al Thani
Crown Prince of Qatar Vice Emir of the island Islamic country.

<P>
As is well known, China's per capita defense spending is among
the lowest in the world. In 1996, it was seven dollars, while
that of the United States was 996 dollars and Japan 360 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Defense spending per serviceman in the United States in 1996
was 178,300 dollars and in Japan 188,000 dollars, while it was
less than 3,000 dollars in China, 1.7 percent of the U.S. level
and 1.6 percent of Japan's.
</P>
<P>
The absolute level of China's defense spending was lower than
that of South Korea and China's Taiwan province, not to mention
the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan and other
western countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the United States spent 263.9 billion dollars on
defense, Britain 32.5 billion, France 38.3 billion, Germany 31.9
billion, Japan 45.1 billion, South Korea 15.6 billion and China's
Taiwan province 13.6 billion, while China spent only 71.5 billion
RMB yuan, about 8.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's total revenue in 1996 was 736.6
billion yuan (88.7 billion dollars) and total expenditure was
791.4 billion yuan (95.3 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
If China spent 87 billion dollars on defense, as the authors
claimed in their book, it would mean that 90 percent of China's
fiscal expenditure in one year went to national defense.
</P>
<P>
I would like to ask the authors that if this was true, where
had China got the money to invest in infrastructure construction,
the development of education, science, health care, cultural
service and to improve the people's living standards? And how
could China have achieved the rapid economic growth?
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that the authors' views are too ridiculous to be
taken seriously. No wonder some American scholars have strongly
criticized the authors since the book was published, saying that
the view of "China Threat" they alluded to was "an exaggerated
view just to scare people." Furthermore, they have accused the
two authors of analyzing issues on China with improper reference
materials and being "too perfunctory" in making judgements on
China's international policies.
</P>
<P>
I would like to point out that there have always been a handful
of people in the United States who are unwilling to see China
becoming a unified and powerful country as well as Sino-U.S. ties
being improved.
</P>
<P>
Whenever China scores points in developing its economy or
whenever Sino-U.S. relations are improved, those people feel
uneasy, and act to fabricate the theory of "China Threat," racking
their brains to play up a media campaign to reduce confidence,
make more troubles, obstruct cooperation and trumpet confrontation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
China's late leader Deng Xiaoping pointed out that China and
the United States should be able to turn their relations for the
better eventually.
</P>
<P>
I would like to advise those people like Bernstein and Munro
not to lift a rock which will only drop on their own feet.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Blasts at UK Rail Station, Highways Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A small bomb exploded at a railway
station in Leeds in northern England this morning, Britain's
railroad and police said.
</P>
<P>
The blast took place at 8:17 local time in a car park adjacent
to the railway station, forcing police to close off areas of Leeds
city center, but there were no injuries, local television reported.
</P>
<P>
Police also carried out a controlled explosion at Stoke railway
station in northwest England, and were still busy searching for
more possible explosive devices in the warned areas, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The explosion followed telephoned bomb warnings at 7:10 this
morning which said bombs had been planted at key railway stations
and on the M6 motorway, bringing traffic chaos to northwest
England.
</P>
<P>
A total of four railway stations, including Doncaster, Crewe
and Stoke-on-Trent, and two motorway junctions were sealed off and
evacuated.
</P>
<P>
This cut off the main north/south rail lines on both the east
and west sides of Britain as well as one of the two main highways
linking the north and south of the country.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major accused the IRA of the
incidents at his daily press conference. He said, "This looks very
much at the moment as though this is the work of the IRA showing
their usual contempt for people's lives and for property."

<P>
The Financial Times:
</P>

<HEADLINE> CCB to Attract More Funds from Major Economic Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The China Construction Bank (CCB)
will focus on large and medium-sized cities to attract more
deposits this year, the bank's president Wang Qishan said today.
</P>
<P>
"The large and medium-sized cities are a major source of cash
flow to commercial banks, and that is why the CCB will give
priority to the expansion of businesses in these cities," Wang
said in his speech to the bank's conference on attracting deposits.
</P>
<P>
The bank's total deposits reached 1.1018 trillion yuan last
year, up about 40 percent from 1995, which ranked CCB the second
among the five major Chinese commercial banks in terms of total
deposits and newly-added deposits.
</P>
<P>
Financial experts say that the competition among commercial
banks is becoming tough, with more Chinese turning their attention
from banks to stocks, bonds, insurance and other investment means
to save their money.
</P>
<P>
CCB will speed up the savings and withdrawal process at all of
its branch offices in each city, and will connect the large cities
with a computer network.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank has taken measures against the increasing
financial risks, by reforming its accounting and auditing system,
and regulating the power limits of its branch presidents.

large amount and bilateral cooperation has expanded. He noted that
there are broad prospects for expanded bilateral economic and
trade cooperation.

<P>
With the development of the two economies, the two governments

efforts by Arabs and Israel, with the support of the international
community.
</P>
<P>
In reiterating the "land for peace" principle as a means of
resolving the Mideast question, Li said that China hopes that the

<HEADLINE> East Chinese Province Smoothing Graves into Farmland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, April 18 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province has
leveled 1.6 million graves into more than 3,300 ha of farmland
during the ongoing spring sowing season.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers have razed or relocated the graves of their
deceased, in response to the provincial government's call to make
more room for farming. Shandong is under pressure from the
decreasing area of farmland and the increasing population.
</P>
<P>
Taking the lead in the campaign, the Party secretary and the
head of Chengyang Township in Qingdao city smoothed graves, and
the work for the whole township was completed within three days.
</P>
<P>
Officials working in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places went
back to their hometowns in the province on hearing the
announcement, and leveled graves there.
</P>
<P>
Different measures have been taken to properly dispose of the
ashes taken from the graves. Qingdao held ceremonies on March 27
and 28 for casting ashes into the sea. Some ashes were buried and
trees were planted on the sites to honor the dead. Other ashes
were placed either in memorial halls or in public cemeteries.

<HEADLINE> Finland Not to Join NATO, Finnish PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Finland will maintain its
"nonalignment" security policy without seeking to join an enlarged
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Kyodo News Service
quoted Finnish Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lipponen, now on a four-day visit to Japan, told Kyodo Thursday
that Finland could best serve its interests and stability in the
region by remaining nonaligned.
</P>
<P>
"We want to maintain independent and credible defense," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to NATO's eastward expansion, Lipponen said, "What is
our concern is NATO enlargement should not result in a new
division" in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the European single currency, Lipponen reiterated
Finland's policy of seeking to participate in the first wave of
European Monetary Union scheduled for January 1999.
</P>

<HEADLINE> EDS-more details added Chinese, Egyptian Leaders Hold Talks in Beijing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng and visiting
Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal Ahmed El-Ganzouri, in a meeting this
morning at the Great Hall of the People, spoke about developing
the stable friendship and cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Egypt was the first African Arab state to
establish diplomatic relations with China, and that the efforts of
the older generation of leaders of the two countries provided a
firm foundation for a sustained development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Over the past nearly 50 years, China and Egypt have forged a
sincere friendship and cooperation based on mutual respect and
understanding, in spite of turbulent changes in the world, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the 90's, Sino-Egyptian ties entered a new era
of development and that the two countries have had exchanges and
cooperation in politics, agriculture, science and technology, and
culture.
</P>
<P>
Li noted out that China and Egypt have similar views on many
major international issues and have cooperated in human rights,
arms control, and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian government has supported China's reunification
cause, Li said, praising its principled stand on the "one China"
policy and pledging not to have official exchanges with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
El-Ganzouri said that China is a great country and that the two
countries have a long-term friendship, and that Egypt admires
China for its reforms and opening up policy and its achievements.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that Egypt is glad to see the return of Hong
Kong under the principle of "one country, two
systems". Reaffirming Egypt's "one China" position, El-Ganzouri
said that his country supports the entry of China into the World
Trade Organization and opposes interference in other countries'
internal affairs, using human rights as an excuse.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China and Egypt have similar conditions and that
both face the task of developing the economy, and that China has
always viewed Egypt as its important partner among Arab states. He
said that the two have no conflict of interest and that it is
China's principle to strengthen friendship and cooperation with
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
China views Sino-Egyptian ties from a strategic viewpoint, Li
said, and is willing to forge long-term and stable friendship and
cooperation with Egypt under the principle of mutual respect,
equality, and reciprocity for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
China is also willing to use this relationship as an example of
cooperation among developing countries, he noted.

<HEADLINE> China To Keep Tighter Rein on Green Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China's stock market is in
another bullish run, but frequent warnings of stock investment
risks from government officials and stock analysts have sounded an
alarm for investors eager to take advantage of the opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"Hammering an awareness of investment risks into the investors'
mind is the top priority at present, and we have to set up a
complete risk-control and management system and fight vigorously
against market irregularities of all kinds," warned Zhou
Zhengqing, chairman of the Securities Committee of the State
Council.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the ongoing International Organization of
Securities Committee (IOSCO) Asia-Pacific Regional Committee
Conference and Enforcement Meeting, Zhou pointed out that
regulation and standardization of the market will remain a
long-term guiding policy of the government, in view of the fact
that the Chinese securities market is still immature.
</P>
<P>
After runaway price hikes which started last October and a
quick recovery from the sharp plunge last December, the stock
market in China rode on another strong yet steadier upward trend
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Composite Stock Index climbed to a record 1,338
points last Wednesday, with the Shenzhen Composite Stock Index
hovering well above 4,700 points.
</P>
<P>
A stock-buying craze has swept throughout China, with investors
lured by the attraction of a big but seemingly too-easy
fortune. There are now over 24 million stock trading accounts
registered in China and the figure is still rising.
</P>
<P>
Stock analysts from the China Securities Co. Ltd. said stock
prices are already too high to be safe in the eyes of the
government.
</P>
<P>
"Strengthened supervision" and "risk prevention" have become
the guidewords of officials and analysts. And the industry
watchdog, China Securities Regulatory Commission, has shown great
enthusiasm for learning from international experience so as to
practice more effective regulation and standardization of the
securities market.
</P>
<P>
The commission has signed an agreement with six overseas
regulatory bodies and plans to sign a seventh on Friday with the
Securities Commission of Malaysia, to get a firmer grip on
supervising and regulating the securities market.
</P>
<P>
A standardized market calls for a perfected regulatory
framework. The government has issued a series of provisional
regulations in recent years, and the draft Securities Law is being
examined by the nation's legislative body.
</P>
<P>
Severe penalties face market violators, including those
securities outlets which provide overdrafts for institutional
investors and who trade stocks on margin.
</P>
<P>
To ease the strained market, the government also announced a
quota of four billion yuan in convertible bonds and planned to
select a group of state enterprises in backbone industries to
issue such bonds.
</P>
<P>
"This act is aimed at increasing market supply and financial
investment instruments to lessen the pressure on the stock market,
and it indicates the government is turning to market-based
leverages in market regulation rather than the past administrative
means," said an analyst with the China Securities Co. Ltd.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Power and Energy Ministry of
Sri Lanka is panning to give electricity to at least 20 villages
by the end of 1998 as the major fraction of the non-electrified
houses are in rural areas, according to electrical department
sources today.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that more than 15,000 villages out of a total
of 25,000 in the country remain without electricity.
</P>
<P>
In view of the innumerable direct and indirect benefits
received by the rural population through electrification, it is
essential to increase the level of electrification faster in order
to assist the economic and social development of the country, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
About 45 percent of the households in Sri Lanka have been
electrified up to now.

<HEADLINE> Yinchuan Implements "Adequate Housing" Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Since 1995, about 2,000
low-income families in Yinchuan, capital of northwest China's
Ningxia Hui Autonomous region, have fulfilled their dream of
owning their own home.
</P>
<P>
An official with the municipal government said that the
"Adequate Housing" program in effect since the end of 1994 has
led to the completion of 102,000 square meters of housing in
Yinchuan.
</P>
<P>
Over the next six years, the city plans to invest 468 million
yuan (about 55.7 million US dollars) in constructing 600,000
square meters of houses.
</P>
<P>
The housing plan is based on the buying capacity of ordinary
citizens, the official said. Among the 59 cities participating in
the program, Yinchuan reports the lowest housing cost -- about
700-750 yuan per square meter.
</P>
<P>
Yinchuan government has established a quality-control system to
supervise construction, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (29-30) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (29-30)
in a question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: Are Hong Kong residents who hold British Dependent
Territories Citizens (BDTC) passports Chinese Citizens?
</P>
<P>
Answer: According to Article 33 of the Chinese Constitution,
all people with the nationality of the People's Republic of China
are Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
Article 2 of the Nationality Law of the People's Republic of
China says that the People's Republic of China is a unified,
multi-ethnic state and people of all ethnicities are all of
Chinese nationality.
</P>
<P>
Article 3 of the Nationality Law says that China does not
recognize double nationality of a Chinese citizen.
</P>
<P>
In its memorandum to the British government in 1984, the
Chinese government clearly states, "All Hong Kong Chinese
compatriots, whether or not they hold the 'British Dependent
Territories Citizens' Passports, are Chinese citizens."
</P>
<P>
This is a proper solution of the nationality issue for Hong
Kong residents in the light of realities in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Question: After 1997, what differences will there be in the
political rights of Chinese nationals and non-Chinese nationals
among Hong Kong residents?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Among the Basic Law's provisions on the rights and
duties of Hong Kong residents, an important issue concerns
nationality. There are indeed differences between Chinese
nationals and non-Chinese nationals among Hong Kong residents with
regard to political rights.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the Constitution and the Nationality Law, the
Basic Law sets great store by the principles of national unity and
sovereignty, stipulating that, in the Hong Kong SAR, the Chief
Executive, principal officials, members of the executive council,
president of the Legislative Council and chief judges of the Court
of Final Appeal and the High Court must be Chinese citizens among
permanent residents of Hong Kong who have no right of abode in
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Also according to the Basic Law, the region's Legislative
Council are to be composed mainly of Chinese citizens who are
permanent residents of the region with no right of abode in any
foreign country; and permanent residents of the region who are not
of Chinese nationality or who have the right of abode in foreign
countries may be elected members of the Legislative Council of the
region, but the proportion of such members may not exceed 20
percent of the total membership of the Council.
</P>
<P>
To sum up, only Chinese citizens among permanent Hong Kong
residents who have no right of abode in foreign countries are
eligible for election to the above-mentioned posts and 80 percent
of the seats of the Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
Article 21 of the Basic Law stipulates, "Chinese citizens who
are residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall
be entitled to participate in the management of state affairs
according to law. In accordance with the assigned number of seats
and the selection method specified by the National People's
congress, Chinese citizens among residents of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region shall locally elect deputies of the
Region to the National People's Congress to participate in the
work of the highest organ of state power."
</P>
<P>
It is evident that only Hong Kong residents of Chinese
nationality have the political right to elect, or stand for
election as, deputies to the National People's Congress and
participate in the administration of state affairs.

BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Hohhot, capital of north China's

<HEADLINE> East China Province Sees Flourishing Bamboo Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
has made significant profits in the bamboo processing industry and
its bamboo-made products sell widely in the world market.
</P>
<P>
"Our products have exported to more than ten countries and
regions, such as the United States, Japan, and some European
countries," said Zhang Ronggen, a 40-year-old farmer.
</P>
<P>
He opened a bamboo processing factory in 1992. Last year, a
Taiwan businessman invested 200,000 US dollars helping Zhang with
the renewal of equipment.
</P>
<P>
The province now has nearly 630,000 hectares of bamboo forest,
which ranks fourth in the country. More than 2,000 factories have
been set up to process bamboo products, such as carvings,
decorations, and furniture.
</P>
<P>
The output value of the bamboo processing industry in Zhejiang
reached nearly 422 million US dollars last year, which included 80
million US dollars for exported products, according to a
provincial official.
</P>
<P>
The Anji County, known as the "sea of bamboo" in northern
Zhejiang, developed a bamboo-made floor last year, which was
hailed by consumers for its high quality and low price.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Muslim Leader to Give State of Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The guerrilla-turned governor of
the Philippine Muslim autonomous region, Nur Misuari, will give
his first State of Region Address on April 28 since taking office
last October.
</P>
<P>
This was announced today by Kabelan Sema, speaker of the
Regional Legislative Assembly of the Autonomous Region of Muslim
Mindanao (ARMM), according to the Philippine News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Sema said Misuari will deliver the State of Region Address at
the opening ceremony of the next session of the Regional
Legislative Assembly (RLA).
</P>
<P>
Expected to be reported by Misuari is his performance for the
past seven months of being the region's chief executive, he said.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the RLA's meeting will be Philippine Senate
President Ernesto Maceda, Speaker of the House of Representatives
Jose de Venecia, and several diplomatic corps from member
countries of the Organization of Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
Sema praised Misuari for his efforts in bringing economic
development and political stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said many foreign investors, mostly Malaysians and
Indonesians, have committed to pour investments into the
poverty-stricken region.
</P>
<P>
But Misuari's critics have slammed him for failing to crack
down on criminals, particularly kidnap-for-ransom groups, who were
doing their business in almost all ARMM provinces.
</P>
<P>
Last November, a surge of kidnappings had prompted local
business groups, mostly of Filipino-Chinese descent, to launch the
first-ever anti-crime protest action in Catabato city in central
Mindanao, where Misuari's governor office is based.
</P>
<P>
Misuari, chairman of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF),
was elected as governor of the ARMM last October during a direct
election held in all ARMM provinces.
</P>
<P>
Misuari signed a peace deal with the government last September,
ending nearly three decades of conflicts between the MNLF and the
government troops in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Misuari also chairs the Southern Philippines Council for Peace
and Development, which was created under the peace accord.

<HEADLINE> South China City to Attract Investment From Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The city of Wuzhou in south
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has paved the way for
attracting investment from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Wuzhou, located 436 km from Hong Kong, has nearly 50,000
natives who have settled in Hong Kong and are expected to help
promote economic contacts between the two places.
</P>
<P>
Wuzhou has so far received 120 million US dollars of investment
from Hong Kong and set up over 400 enterprises, accounting for
more than 80 percent of the number of local overseas-funded
companies.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the exports in Wuzhou, or over one billion yuan,
is brought in by the local Hong Kong-funded enterprises, which
conduct business in the fields of industry, agriculture,
processing, real estate, transportation, and services.
</P>
<P>
The city has drawn up a series of flexible policies covering
transfer and use of land, fee charges, rent of factory buildings
and foreign trade, in a bid to encourage Hong Kong business people
to invest locally.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Wuzhou has injected nearly 300 million yuan to
improve the local investment environment. As a result, the city
has built an airport and two container harbors with handling
capacity reaching 300,000 tons and 500,000 tons, respectively,
added 53,000 lines of program-controlled telephones, extended a
highway linking with Shenzhen, and set up bonded warehouses for
the processing trade.

<HEADLINE> Rong Yiren Meets Latin American Parliament President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Rong Yiren
today expressed the hope that the National People's Congress (NPC)
will become an observer of the Latin American Parliament in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with Juan Adolfo Singer, president of the Latin
American Parliament, at the Great Hall of the People here this
morning, Rong said China and Latin American countries are
developing countries and they share many common viewpoints on
major international issues.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Latin American Parliament is an important and
influential international organization, he said the NPC attaches
great importance to furthering the relationship between the two.
</P>
<P>
Last year, he said, the NPC formally applied to become an
observer of the parliament. Rong thanked the parliamentary members
of some Latin American countries for their positive efforts to
this end.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the NPC will become an observer of the Latin
American Parliament at an early date," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rong noted that the Taiwan authorities have been working
worldwide in an attempt to trick their way into the Latin American
Parliament and sabotage the friendly ties and cooperation between
the NPC and the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Their political intention is to create "two Chinas" or "one
China, one Taiwan," which absolutely cannot be accepted by the
Chinese People, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Rong extended his warm welcome to Singer
and his party and expressed the belief that their visit will help
deepen mutual understanding and cooperation between the NPC and
the Latin American Parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said that the NPC has maintained close contact and good
cooperation with most of the member states of the Latin American
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Rong said he hopes that their exchanges will develop so as to
promote mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Latin
American Countries in the fields of politics, economy, trade,
culture, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Singer said the Latin American countries' cooperation with
China will be beneficial to the entire world.
</P>
<P>
The Latin American countries place great importance on
developing their ties with China. Therefore, the Latin American
Parliament will establish a long and friendly relationship with
China's NPC, he said.
</P>
<P>
Singer said the issue of China's application to be an observer
of the Latin American Parliament will be settled successfully, and
the parliament will not discuss the issue concerning the
development of its relationship with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Rong also briefed the visitors on China's economic growth.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 18 (Xinhua) -- India's Congress Party today
formally extended its support to the 13-party United Front (UF) in
forming a government under a new leader by writing a letter to the
president in this regard, Press Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
The Congress Party, which pulled down the UF government led by
Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda by withdrawing support at the end
of last month, renewed its support to the Front in a resolution
adopted on April 15 but did not submit a letter to President
Shankar Dayal Sharma to establish the support.
</P>
<P>
A copy of the letter written by the Congress Party's President
Sitaram Kesri was also delivered to the UF leaders who met here
this morning to discuss the crucial leadership issue.
</P>
<P>
The Congress Party has set a change of leadership in UF as a
precondition to extend support to the Front in forming an
alternate government.
</P>
<P>
UF spokesman Jaipal Reddy welcomed the Congress Party's move,
saying that the Front is reviewing the content of the letter.
</P>
<P>
The letter submitted by the Congress Party to the president is
expected to speed up the process for the UF to elect a new leader
in place of outgoing Prime Minister Deve Gowda.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Invests Heavily in Water Conservation Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province has invested a record of more than four billion yuan in
water conservation facilities by mid-March this year, accounting
for over one tenth of the national total in the same period.
</P>
<P>
The province was hit by a huge flood in 1994, causing great
damage and casualties.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Guangdong has stepped up efforts to turn around the
traditional concept of water conservation merely for agriculture,
and to establish a new idea that water conservation is a basic
industry in national economic development and people's life.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong put more than 17 billion yuan in water conservation
construction during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995),
and will invest another 50 billion yuan by 2005 to change the
situation in which flood prevention capacity lags behind economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing Feilaixia Water Control Project and other dykes and
dams projects will form an anti-flood shelter in the Pearl River
Delta area to fight the most serious flood possible in 300
years. Cities with population above 500,000 are required to build
water control facilities that can fight the serious flood possible
in 100 years.

the largest of its kind on the Yellow River, to make sure it will
be dammed as scheduled on October 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
More than 11 million cubic meters of earth and stone have been
poured into the river from both sides to form a 200-meter-high dam

</P>
<P>
Work on the intake tower, the most difficult part of the
project, has been completed. The three tunnel intakes, each with a
length of 1,100 meters and a diameter of 14.5 meters have been
constructed. Workers are building an inner lining with bricks.
</P>
<P>
Work on a pool to reduce the impulsive force of flood at the
outlet of the three tunnel intakes has been half completed. Over
85 percent of the earthwork for the power house has been done.
</P>
<P>
More than 7,000 households with a population of 20,000 living
in the dam area have moved to new villages.

SEOUL, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean Red Cross
committee today expressed the hope to contact with its counterpart
in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to discuss the
provision of food aid and relief goods to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was raised by South Korean Red Cross President
Kang Young-hoon to his DPRK counterpart Li Songho in a direct
telephone message this morning.
</P>
<P>
Kang Young-hoon suggested that both committees send a
three-member delegation headed by each other's secretary-general
to the truce village of Panmunjom to discuss the delivery of the
aid from South Korea to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
In his message, Kang expressed his concern about the "difficult
food situation in the North (DPRK)".
</P>
<P>
So far, the assistance to the DPRK provided by South Korea was
mainly transferred by the International Red Cross League and other
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government decided on March 31 to allow
non-governmental organizations to provide food assistance to the
DPRK. But the aid must be delivered exclusively through the
channel of Red Cross.

<HEADLINE> Indian President in Bid to End Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Indian President Shanker Dayal
Sharma has begun a serious exercise to seek an early end to the
current political crisis by talking to top political leaders in
the country, the Hindustan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The president on Thursday held separate meetings with Congress
party President Sitaram Kesri, general secretary of the Communist
Party of Indian (Marxist) H. S. Surjeet and Bharatiya Janata Party
leader Atal Behari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
Caretaker Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda also had a meeting
with the president on Wednesday night to discuss the political
situation.
</P>
<P>
Sharma's discussions with the political leaders were seen as
"anxiety" on his part to resolve the deadlock and intended to get
first-hand knowledge of the efforts undertaken by them in the last
few days for forming the next government to avoid premature
dissolution of the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament),
officials close to the president said.
</P>
<P>
The United Front government led by Prime Minister Deve Gowda
lost a vote of confidence on April 11 following the withdrawal of
support by the Congress party.
</P>
<P>
However, the efforts made by the Congress party and the United
Front to form an alternate government to avoid a snap poll have
been stalled over a procedural issue.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted on April 15, the Congress party said
that it will extend support to the United Front to form a new
government after the front chooses a new leader in place of Deve
Gowda.
</P>
<P>
However, the United Front, especially the left parties in it,
insisted that the Congress party first withdraw a claim it staked
on April 1 to form a government before the front changes its
leadership.
</P>
<P>
Though the Congress party makes it clear that it will recall
the claim from the president after a change of leadership in the
front, the latter refuses to buy the idea saying there is a "game
plan" behind.

<HEADLINE> Italy Backs Romania's Bid for EU, NATO Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Italy fully supports Romania's bid
for membership of the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO), Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
said today.
</P>
<P>
Romania's integration into NATO among the first wave of new
members "is what we propose and what we want," Dini said, after
meeting his Romanian counterpart, Adrian Severin, here.
</P>
<P>
In supporting Romania's bid, Italy expects to help the EU and
NATO to "keep getting stronger," he said.
</P>
<P>
A NATO summit scheduled for July is expected to announce the
first group of nations to be admitted to NATO.
</P>
<P>
Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland are widely expected to
be the first countries invited to join, followed by Romania.
</P>
<P>
Dini said that during his meeting with Severin, he thanked
Romania for its participation in the Italian led multinational
force to safeguard humanitarian aid to Albania. Romania will send
400 soldiers to take part in the United Nations approved
6,000-strong mission.
</P>
<P>
Romania's participation was important as the operation was "a
European NATO exercise", Dini added.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi also met Severin today to
discuss bilateral ties and Romania's early admission to the EU and
NATO.
</P>
<P>
The planned NATO expansion was strongly opposed by Russia,
which believes the military alliance's eastward enlargement would
threaten its national security.

<HEADLINE> Small Parties in Nepal Demand Right to Choose Symbols </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Small political parties in
Nepal have called on the government to ensure their right to
choose symbols for the local elections next month.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of 17 parties Thursday handed over memorandums to
Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand and the Election Commission
in protest against the Commission's earlier decision to distribute
election symbols to the small parties arbitrarily.
</P>
<P>
The small parties are those who won less than 3 percent votes
in last elections.
</P>
<P>
The parties, led by the Nepal Workers and Peasants' Party
(NWPP) which has three MPs in the 205-seat lower house, said that
the commission's decision, which ruled out the use of their own
symbols, was a conspiracy by big parties to curb the growth of
smaller ones.
</P>
<P>
According to officials of the Election Commission, the decision
on small parties' symbols was made in accordance with the
country's law concerning local elections.
</P>
<P>
However, Prime Minister Chand reportedly has pledged to try to
sort out the problem by holding necessary discussions with the
Chief Election Commissioner.
</P>
<P>
Nepal is to hold the elections for chief officers and
representatives of over 4,000 local administration bodies across
the country from May 17.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Academic Accuses U.S. Authors of Fabricating Quotes  (Part One) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese academic has
accused two U.S. authors of fabricating quotes in their recently
publised book on Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Mi Zhenyu's article, entitled "Foolish Lies -- A Comment on
'The Coming Conflict With China,'" was published by the Chinese
press today. The full text of the article reads as follows:
</P>
<P>
I have recently read the book "The Coming Conflict With
America" written by Richard Bernstein and Ross H. Munro, former
Beijing-based foreign correspondents for Time magazine and the
Toronto Globe and Mail respectively.
</P>
<P>
What shocked me is that the authors' headline quotation in the
book's introduction quoted remarks attributed to me that I have
never made. The quote said, "(As for the United States) for a
relatively long time it will be absolutely necessary that we
quietly nurse our sense of vengeance... We must conceal our
abilities and bide our time." (The ellipsis existed in the
original quote.) The authors of the book did not provide the
exact source of their quote but just said "in a widely published
1996 collection of essays by several Chinese officials." Among
the books published in China in 1996, only one book, "Megatrends
China," published by Hua Ling Publishing House, carried one of my
articles called "China's Strategic Policy on Positive Defense."
</P>
<P>
In my article, I elaborated the theory that China's military
strategic policy can only be one of "active defense," determined
by the nature of the country, its social system, basic domestic
and foreign policies, and the tasks of its armed forces, as
stipulated in the Chinese Constitution.
</P>
<P>
China's military strategy is subordinate to and serves the
basic policy of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the
constitution, which defines that the nature of the nation's
military strategic policy is one of self-defense and defense.
</P>
<P>
I also pointed out in the article that China advocates avoiding
and stopping war, and settling international disputes and issues
left over from history by peaceful means instead of resorting to
war, and that preventing war constitutes an important part of the
strategic policy of active defense in the new era.
</P>
<P>
I didn't mention the United States anywhere in the article, nor
did I say anything similar to that quoted in the U.S. book.
</P>
<P>
If the two authors of the book think I said what they quoted on
some other occasions or in some other articles, then they should
show me the evidence. If not, the quote they attributed to me is
nothing but sheer fabrication.
</P>
<P>
It is hard to understand why the two authors turned a deaf ear
to the principles of "increasing mutual trust, reducing trouble,
developing cooperation and avoiding confrontation," which
President Jiang Zemin has stated repeatedly to guide Sino-U.S.
relations.
</P>
<P>
They are obsessed with using other people's names to invent
lies and to escalate the hostile atmosphere between China and the
United States, so as to deceive and mislead the world opinion.
</P>
<P>
To support the "China Threat" theory, the two authors turned
right and wrong upside down, confused black with white and made up
facts to support their views to vilify and demonize China's
politics, economy, diplomacy and human rights conditions. China's
defense and military policy was especially a primary target for
their vicious attack.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Academic Accuses U.S. Authors of Fabricating Quotes  (Part Two) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The authors made a big issue of China's defense spending,
saying China's "actual" annual defense budget should be 10 times
the amount of what was announced and therefore has reached a level
of "87 billion U.S. dollars."
</P>
<P>
As is well known, China's per capita defense spending is among
the lowest in the world. In 1996, it was seven dollars, while
that of the United States was 996 dollars and Japan 360 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Defense spending per serviceman in the United States in 1996
was 178,300 dollars and in Japan 188,000 dollars, while it was
less than 3,000 dollars in China, 1.7 percent of the U.S. level
and 1.6 percent of Japan's.
</P>
<P>
The absolute level of China's defense spending was lower than
that of South Korea and China's Taiwan province, not to mention
the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan and other
western countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the United States spent 263.9 billion dollars on
defense, Britain 32.5 billion, France 38.3 billion, Germany 31.9
billion, Japan 45.1 billion, South Korea 15.6 billion and China's
Taiwan province 13.6 billion, while China spent only 71.5 billion
RMB yuan, about 8.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's total revenue in 1996 was 736.6
billion yuan (88.7 billion dollars) and total expenditure was
791.4 billion yuan (95.3 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
If China spent 87 billion dollars on defense, as the authors
claimed in their book, it would mean that 90 percent of China's
fiscal expenditure in one year went to national defense.
</P>
<P>
I would like to ask the authors that if this was true, where
had China got the money to invest in infrastructure construction,
the development of education, science, healthcare, cultural
service and to improve the people's living standards? And how
could China have achieved the rapid economic growth?
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that the authors' views are too ridiculous to be
taken seriously. No wonder some American scholars have strongly
criticized the authors since the book was published, saying that
the view of "China Threat" they alluded to was "an exaggerated
view just to scare people." Furthermore, they have accused the
two authors of analyzing issues on China with improper reference
materials and being "too perfunctory" in making judgements on
China's international policies.
</P>
<P>
I would like to point out that there have always been a handful
of people in the United States who are unwilling to see China
becoming a unified and powerful country as well as Sino-U.S. ties
being improved.
</P>
<P>
Whenever China scores points in developing its economy or
whenever Sino-U.S. relations are improved, those people feel
uneasy, and act to fabricate the theory of "China Threat," racking
their brains to play up a media campaign to reduce confidence,
make more troubles, obstruct cooperation and trumpet confrontation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
China's late leader Deng Xiaoping pointed out that China and
the United States should be able to turn their relations for the
better eventually.
</P>
<P>
I would like to advise those people like Bernstein and Munro
not to lift a rock which will only drop on their own feet.

<HEADLINE> Italian Troops to Enter Albanian Port Vlore Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The first contingent of Italian
troops is expected to enter Albania's southern port of Vlore no
later than early next week, Italian Defense Chief of Staff Admiral
Guido Venturoni said here today.
</P>
<P>
Venturoni said the Italian force will move once the
multinational protection force is fully established in the capital
city Tirana.
</P>
<P>
Following the Albania's largest port of Durres in the west and
Tirana airport, Vlore is the third key port of entry into Albania
that the 6,000-strong force from eight countries wants to secure.
</P>
<P>
The port is a hotbed for insurgence after anger over failed
investment schemes, in which many Albanians lost their life
savings, turned violent in January.
</P>
<P>
The relative delay in establishing a bridgehead in Vlore,
compared to those in Durres and Tirana, was due to technical not
political considerations, he added.
</P>
<P>
So far, Venturoni said, about 1,800 men have been deployed in
various parts of Albania as part of the so-called Operation
Alba. They are 717 Italians, 450 French, 359 Spanish, 125 Greeks
and 169 Turkish.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the first four Italian coast guards units, assigned
to patrol the Albanian coastline and ports under the agreement
between Rome and Tirana, left Italian southern port of Brindisi
this morning.
</P>
<P>
Before taking up service, the ships will first take on Albanian
liaison officers.
</P>
<P>
Ferry transport between Italy and Durres, interrupted on March
13, will also resume Friday. First passengers will be Operation
Alba men, while civilian service is expected to resume on April
28.

<P>
SOFIA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria is ready to send troops to
join the Italian-led multinational force which has started "Alba"
operations in Albania, the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by a Bulgarian official committee which
is responsible for promoting Bulgarian membership of NATO. It was
conveyed by the first vice foreign minister of Bulgaria, Valentin
Dobrev, to the Italian ambassador in Sofia.
</P>
<P>
The committee urged the general headquarters of the Bulgarian
army to send a unit of limited numbers to participate in the Alba
operations in Albania.
</P>
<P>
However, the exact number of Bulgarian soldiers joining the
multinational force was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The committee also decided to make financial preparations for
Bulgaria's joining NATO.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution on
March 25 authorizing the dispatch of a 6,000-member, Italian-led
multinational force for three months to protect relief operations
in chaos-torn Albania.
</P>
<P>
Besides Italy, France, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Austria, Denmark
and Romania have sent soldiers to Albania.

<HEADLINE> Chubais Urges to Review 1997 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 17 (Xinhua) -- First Russian Vice Premier Anatoly
Chubais today called for a review of the 1997 federal budget
because its targets cannot be met in the current crisis, Itar-Tass
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Federation Council (upper house), Chubais, who
is also the finance minister, noted that Russia is living through
"an outrageous budget crisis," -- but not through a disastrous
slump.
</P>
<P>
He said the budget exceeded the ability of the state to pay by
100,000 billion roubles (about 17.4 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Chubais said revenue targets in the first quarter were met by
only 56.6 percent and expenditure by 62.8 percent, while the tax
collection was only met by 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that a review of the budget was "absolutely
necessary," adding that proposals would be submitted to the
Russian parliament for approval.
</P>
<P>
Chubais stressed that the main task was to adopt a program for
emergency revenues, totaling 30,000 billion roubles.
</P>
<P>
Referring to 1998 budget, Chubais said the Russian
Administration would call the first meeting on it in May.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about payment of wages and pension arrears, Chubais
confirmed that pension arrears would be paid by July 1, 1997, and
transfer debts to regions would be fully paid by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that the government intended to connect the
amount of benefit payments to the level of wellbeing in families.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Offers Promising Opportunities to Developed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- With an average economic growth
rate of 6-7 percent a year, ASEAN countries, particularly
Indonesia, offer promising business opportunities to developed
countries, an Indonesian businessman said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a businessmen's dialogue held in Yogyakarta,
Central Java, Thursday, executive chairman of the First ASEAN
Business Summit 1997 (FABS '97) Suryo B. Sulisto said the ASEAN
countries' success in attaining high economic growth had been
widely recognized by developed countries, reports reaching here
today said.
</P>
<P>
To maintain growth at the same pace, the ASEAN countries needed
to ensure the continuity of conducive social, political and
security conditions, he noted.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), which comprises
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand
and Vietnam, was now also the fourth biggest entity in world trade
after the United States, Japan and Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
The value of trade transactions between ASEAN and non-ASEAN
countries had reached around 700 billion US dollars, while
intra-ASEAN trade was recorded at only 100 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to spur investments should continuously be encouraged
particularly in Indonesia, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the FABS '97 held on March 9-10 in Jakarta, many investment
opportunities with bright prospects had been identified, which
included infrastructure covering the construction and installation
of telephone, electricity, ports, toll roads and irrigation
networks.

<HEADLINE> Probe on Nepali Former Government's Fall Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A panel of Nepal's opposition
has concluded that no party leader should bear the responsibility
for the fall of the former government last month, sources here
said today.
</P>
<P>
The three-member investigation committee of the Nepali Congress
(NC) party, formed earlier to probe the cause behind the defeat of
a confidence vote for the NC-led coalition government in early
March, Thursday completed its report, ruling out any conspiracy
within the party.
</P>
<P>
The report will be made public after it is further evaluated
and approved by the NC party's Central Working Committee, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The former coalition government of Sher Bahadur Deuba, a young
generation NC leader, collapsed after losing the confidence vote
directly due to two NC MPs' deliberate absence from the voting
session in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Lokendra Bahadur Chand, a leader of NC's former ruling partner
the National Democratic Party (RPP), formed the present government
last month under an alliance with the Communist Party of Nepal
(United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML), the largest party in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers earlier reported that Chand had managed to
lure away the two NC lawmakers from the parliamentary voting in
order to bring down the NC-led coalition government.

<HEADLINE> Good Prospects for Maldivian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Maldivian economy was poised
to improve with the two main industries, tourism and fisheries,
providing a strong base for growth, according to a report reaching
here from Male today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the outlook for the Maldives remains positive
with GDP growth expected to average 6 percent a year in 1997 and
1998.
</P>
<P>
A continuing tight monetary policy plus an increase in the
number of tourists and a higher fish catch led to a marked
economic improvement in 1996, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Real gross domestic product growth in 1996 was estimated at 6.5
percent while inflation was at 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Reduced public spending and a tight monetary policy are
expected to keep inflation subdued at about 3 percent in 1997 and
1998.
</P>
<P>
The exceptionally high rates of economic growth reached in
1985-90, more than 10 percent per year, could not be repeated in
the near future due to capacity constraints in both tourism and
fisheries, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Ecuadoran Authorities Seek Termination to Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Ecuadoran authorities proposed
today to the leaders of a health workers strike to search for a
solution considering the difficulties the country is going
through.
</P>
<P>
Up to 28,000 doctors and 14,000 other medical workers have been
on strike for three days in demand of a budget increase, from 2.8
to 12 percent, for the public health sector.
</P>
<P>
Health assistance centers remain closed and medical care is
given only to the extremely urgent cases.
</P>
<P>
"The country is going through difficult circumstances, and
hence solutions must be found jointly by various sectors and the
national government," said acting President Fabian Alarcon.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador saw a political crisis since the Congress impeached
President Abdala Bucaram Ortiz and forced him to step on February 6.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever might be the case, the government wants to give all
the priority and agility to the solution of this problem," Alarcon
said.
</P>
<P>
Taking the stoppage as one of the points he concerns most,
Alarcon is planning to intervene in the conversations and to
establish a plan of action and a calendar of work.
</P>
<P>
But Health Minister Guillermo Wagner said it is impossible to
meet the demand of 12 billion sucres (approximately 3.1 million
U.S. dollars) for bonuses, although other solutions are being
explored.

<HEADLINE> German Party Leader Describes China Impressions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China attaches importance to
learning from the capitalist world whatever can accelerate its
scientific progress, says Honorary Chairman of the Democratic
Socialist Party Hans Modrow.
</P>
<P>
Modrow was talking to a German newspaper about his impressions
of China during his visit between April 5 and 13.
</P>
<P>
China implements a policy of reform and opening up and builds
socialism with Chinese characteristics, he told the Nenes
Dentschland newspaper on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said China has come to know the problems emerging during the
process of reform and opening up, such as those existing in
state-owned enterprises, and the problems of social welfare.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leaders were determined to carry out the behests of
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, whose death did not mean an
interruption in the implementation of the policy he inaugurated,
said Modrow, who visited China in 1959 and again in 1992.
</P>
<P>
On the human rights issue, Modrow said: "I think that so long
as people have food, housing and work in a country with a
1.2-billion population, the basic human rights there are
guaranteed."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese leaders are willing to conduct dialogue on the
human rights issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "No problem can be solved by means of sheer
confrontation."

<P>
YANGON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Minister for Agriculture

Year, Myint Aung disclosed that Myanmar's agricultural production
in the 1996-97 fiscal year ended March 31 has increased by 3.7 per
cent.
</P>
<P>
To enhance agricultural production, he said, the government is
providing assistance to peasants in boosting per-hectare yield and
multiple cropping and extending cultivated area.
</P>
<P>
In order to make more water available, he added, altogether 76
dams have been built since 1988, irrigating 486,000 hectares of
farmland.

TIANJIN, April 18 (Xinhua) -- North China's port city of
Tianjin is increasing its efforts to control pollution from
vehicle exhaust fumes.
</P>
<P>
With the number of the city's vehicles exceeding 600,000,
pollutant discharge has also been increasing. Statistics from the

<P>
The city has set up a task force to control the vehicle
pollution in order to protect people's health.
</P>
<P>
The task force requires the automobile and motor-makers meet
the government standards in production, and strictly controls the
sale of vehicles that fail to meet the discharge standards.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin's mobile monitoring groups have been making regular
checks of the vehicles on the road. Those exceeding the discharge
standards will be forced to improve before they can run on the
road again.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Academic Accuses U.S. Authors of Fabricating Quotes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese academic has
accused two U.S. authors of fabricating quotes in their recently
publised book on Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Mi Zhenyu's article, entitled "Foolish Lies -- A Comment on
'The Coming Conflict With China,'" was published by the Chinese
press today. The full text of the article reads as follows:
</P>
<P>
I have recently read the book "The Coming Conflict With
America" written by Richard Bernstein and Ross H. Munro, former
Beijing-based foreign correspondents for Time magazine and the
Toronto Globe and Mail respectively.
</P>
<P>
What shocked me is that the authors' headline quotation in the
book's introduction quoted remarks attributed to me that I have
never made. The quote said, "(As for the United States) for a
relatively long time it will be absolutely necessary that we
quietly nurse our sense of vengeance... We must conceal our
abilities and bide our time." (The ellipsis existed in the
original quote.) The authors of the book did not provide the
exact source of their quote but just said "in a widely published
1996 collection of essays by several Chinese officials." Among
the books published in China in 1996, only one book, "Megatrends
China," published by Hua Ling Publishing House, carried one of my
articles called "China's Strategic Policy on Positive Defense."
</P>
<P>
In my article, I elaborated the theory that China's military
strategic policy can only be one of "active defense," determined
by the nature of the country, its social system, basic domestic
and foreign policies, and the tasks of its armed forces, as
stipulated in the Chinese Constitution.
</P>
<P>
China's military strategy is subordinate to and serves the
basic policy of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the
constitution, which defines that the nature of the nation's
military strategic policy is one of self-defense and defense.
</P>
<P>
I also pointed out in the article that China advocates avoiding
and stopping war, and settling international disputes and issues
left over from history by peaceful means instead of resorting to
war, and that preventing war constitutes an important part of the
strategic policy of active defense in the new era.
</P>
<P>
I didn't mention the United States anywhere in the article, nor
did I say anything similar to that quoted in the U.S. book.
</P>
<P>
If the two authors of the book think I said what they quoted on
some other occasions or in some other articles, then they should
show me the evidence. If not, the quote they attributed to me is
nothing but sheer fabrication.
</P>
<P>
It is hard to understand why the two authors turned a deaf ear
to the principles of "increasing mutual trust, reducing trouble,
developing cooperation and avoiding confrontation," which
President Jiang Zemin has stated repeatedly to guide Sino-U.S.
relations.
</P>
<P>
They are obsessed with using other people's names to invent
lies and to escalate the hostile atmosphere between China and the
United States, so as to deceive and mislead the world opinion.
</P>
<P>
To support the "China Threat" theory, the two authors turned
right and wrong upside down, confused black with white and made up
facts to support their views to vilify and demonize China's
politics, economy, diplomacy and human rights conditions. China's
defense and military policy was especially a primary target for
their vicious attack.
</P>
<P>
The authors made a big issue of China's defense spending,
saying China's "actual" annual defense budget should be 10 times
the amount of what was announced and therefore has reached a level
of "87 billion U.S. dollars."
</P>
<P>
As is well known, China's per capita defense spending is among
the lowest in the world. In 1996, it was seven dollars, while
that of the United States was 996 dollars and Japan 360 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Defense spending per serviceman in the United States in 1996
was 178,300 dollars and in Japan 188,000 dollars, while it was
less than 3,000 dollars in China, 1.7 percent of the U.S. level
and 1.6 percent of Japan's.
</P>
<P>
The absolute level of China's defense spending was lower than
that of South Korea and China's Taiwan province, not to mention
the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan and other
western countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the United States spent 263.9 billion dollars on
defense, Britain 32.5 billion, France 38.3 billion, Germany 31.9
billion, Japan 45.1 billion, South Korea 15.6 billion and China's
Taiwan province 13.6 billion, while China spent only 71.5 billion
RMB yuan, about 8.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's total revenue in 1996 was 736.6
billion yuan (88.7 billion dollars) and total expenditure was
791.4 billion yuan (95.3 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
If China spent 87 billion dollars on defense, as the authors
claimed in their book, it would mean that 90 percent of China's
fiscal expenditure in one year went to national defense.
</P>
<P>
I would like to ask the authors that if this was true, where
had China got the money to invest in infrastructure construction,
the development of education, science, healthcare, cultural
service and to improve the people's living standards? And how
could China have achieved the rapid economic growth?
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that the authors' views are too ridiculous to be
taken seriously. No wonder some American scholars have strongly
criticized the authors since the book was published, saying that
the view of "China Threat" they alluded to was "an exaggerated
view just to scare people." Furthermore, they have accused the
two authors of analyzing issues on China with improper reference
materials and being "too perfunctory" in making judgements on
China's international policies.
</P>
<P>
I would like to point out that there have always been a handful
of people in the United States who are unwilling to see China
becoming a unified and powerful country as well as Sino-U.S. ties
being improved.
</P>
<P>
Whenever China scores points in developing its economy or
whenever Sino-U.S. relations are improved, those people feel
uneasy, and act to fabricate the theory of "China Threat," racking
their brains to play up a media campaign to reduce confidence,
make more troubles, obstruct cooperation and trumpet confrontation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
China's late leader Deng Xiaoping pointed out that China and
the United States should be able to turn their relations for the
better eventually.
</P>
<P>
I would like to advise those people like Bernstein and Munro
not to lift a rock which will only drop on their own feet.

<HEADLINE> Six Sri Lankan Soldiers Killed in Mine Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Six Sri Lankan soldiers including
an officer were killed in a mine blast at Nagarkovil in the Jaffna
peninsula Thursday, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether the mine had been laid by Tamil rebels
sometime earlier or it had been set up specially to blow up the
vehicle in which the government soldiers were traveling, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The reports added that the attack had come when troops had
observed major movements of rebel cadres northwards from the east.
</P>
<P>
However, there had not been any mine blast in the Jaffna
peninsula during the past few weeks although yesterday's blast was
the most serious this year.
</P>
<P>
The Jaffna peninsula was once the stronghold of the Tamil
rebels, who have been waging a 14-year war for a separate state
in the north and east of the country.
</P>
<P>
Having lost their heartland the Jaffna peninsula since last
May, they have been pushed into jungle hideouts from where they
have been launching sporadic attacks on army camps and mobile
patrols.

BUCKAREST, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A sudden cold spell in Romania
has brought on snow and strong winds in many ports of Romania
recently, with some farm land and electricity services out of
action.

<P>
A lot of farm land was flooded in the southern part of the
country, where there was heavy rain for more than 10 consecutive
days.
</P>
<P>
The cold current which came in from the north brought snow
which fell 30 to 40 centimeters thick in central and eastern
Romania.
</P>
<P>
Strong winds snapped electric wires in more than 100 townships
in the south, though there was little snow there.
</P>
<P>
Experts predicted that the weather could not improve until the

<HEADLINE> China to Launch New Prices Checks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China will launch a series of
large scale prices checks in key sectors such as railway transport
and agricultural products this year, according to a Beijing-based
newspaper recently.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of this year, China's price checking and
administrative departments will check the fees charged by the
departments in charge of construction, land-use, social security,
and labor forces, Monday's Township Enterprises Daily said.
</P>
<P>
The illegal fee charging actions, such as raising charging
standards and extending the charging range in these sectors will
be stopped and punished, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The overcharging on housing projects will be paid special
attention.
</P>
<P>
Overcharging on services in the railway transport sector has
been a big problem for several years in the country, the price
administrative departments noted, saying they will redouble their
efforts to check the transport fee and major service fee charged
on trains.
</P>
<P>
Through checks, prices of agricultural means of production,
such as chemical fertilizers and pesticides, will be kept
reasonably low for farmers to protect their initiative for
agricultural production, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The high prices for medicines and commission for medical
personnel will also be curbed during two large-scale checks this
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Uzbek Prime Minister Utkur Sultanov
today began his two-day official visit to Ukraine in order to
strengthen economic ties between the two former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian Prime Minister Pavel Lazarenko discussed with
Sultanov the possibilities for Uzbekistan exporting cotton and its
rich reserves in natural gas.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Uzbekistan would provide Ukraine with 1

</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers also expected to set up an aviation
joint venture using Uzbekistan's An-12 passenger planes and
Ukraine's An-70 transport aircraft. The wide-body An-70 is similar
to the American C-130.
</P>
<P>
"Our economic cooperation will surely be deepened because we
have been taking concrete measures," said Ukrainian President
Leonid Kuchma during his meeting with Sultanov today.
</P>
<P>
The two nations are planning to broaden cooperation on foreign
trade, military technology, transport and in other areas. Details
will be discussed by the Ukrainian-Uzbek Joint Committee, which
began its first session today.

<HEADLINE> Former Rebels to Integrate With Philippine Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Final integration of the 1,500
Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) members into the Armed
Forces was scheduled for September this year after they finish six
months of training, local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
These MNLF members, who gained qualifications to join the
Philippine military earlier this year, has started training
courses this month, Victor Garcia, armed forces chief for
civil-military affairs, was quoted as telling a press briefing
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said training centers for the successful applicants are
located all over Mindanao island, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF, formerly the largest Muslim rebel group in the
southern Philippines, concluded a peace deal last September with
the government, ending nearly three decades of war in the south
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace deal, the military should integrate 5,500 MNLF
members into their ranks while another 2,000 members are to be
absorbed by the Philippine National Police.
</P>
<P>
Garcia also denied earlier reports that some 5,000 MNLF members
have defected to the breakaway Moro Islamic Liberation Front
because of dissatisfaction over the "slow-paced" integration of
the MNLF into the military.
</P>
<P>
He said the report was another "propaganda ploy" of the MILF in
view of the success of the integration program of the military.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, currently the largest anti-government force in the
country, refused to accept the MNLF-government peace deal and
sought its own peace talks with the government.

<HEADLINE> China's Small Firms Compete Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China strives to help its small
and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to enter the world market,
"China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Chen Qingtai, vice-minister of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, made the pledge Thursday at the end of a two-day work
conference.
</P>
<P>
As China has become a member of Apec and its entry into the WTO
is on the agenda, China's SMEs will be exposed to fierce
international competition both at home and abroad, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The government has offered to support the SMEs, as they are not
capable on their own of coping with the complexities of the world
market, he added.
</P>
<P>
China will set up a service system, which will assist SMEs in
the fields of financing, market access, information, technology
and human resources, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The practice is in line with the requirements of Apec's
Platform for SMEs and aims to transform China's SMEs into
creative, market-oriented, competitive entities.
</P>
<P>
Non-governmental organizations will also play a vital role in
establishing the system, as they have more advantages in promoting
service-system related information exchanges and attracting
investments from other Apec member countries.
</P>
<P>
Other measures to be made by the government include the
completion of an information consulting center and a personnel
training center in the next two to three years.
</P>
<P>
Trade with Apec member countries is also an important part of
the SMEs' aim of breaking in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Sino-German bilateral co-operation on SMEs is developing
rapidly, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China will help its SMEs to extend co-operation
with partners in Japan, Korea, Italy and Israel.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Deplores U.S. Trade Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Argentina deeply deplored
U.S. withdrawal of preferences to Argentine products because it
alleged that the Argentine laws refused to protect U.S. trademarks
and patents from local manufacturers of pharmaceutical products.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.S. Commerce Representative Marlene Barchevsky
published here today, Argentine Foreign Minister Guido di Tella
said that the U.S. move did not "agree with the excellent
relations of our countries."
</P>
<P>
Barchevsky announced the withdrawal of U.S. Generalized System
of Preferences to Argentine products on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Argentina would suffer a loss of 8-12 million U.S. dollars for
higher tariffs because of the U.S. move. Last year, Argentina
earned 118 million dollars from its pharmaceutical products on the
U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
However, it is believed that the move has a bigger political
clout than economic one, because the U.S. places Argentina among
those countries which do not respect intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
"Argentina is convinced that its legislation on patents of
pharmaceutical products and industrial secret fulfillment, and in
some aspects, goes beyond" what is established by the World Trade
Organization (WTO), Di Tella said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. pharmaceutical trans-national companies, whose
pressures resulted in the sanctions, said they suffer losses of up
to 500 million dollars a year because of the "piracy" of Argentine
pharmaceutical companies which dominate the market here.
</P>
<P>
The White House objects to the Argentine laws that give local
companies the deadline of the year 2000 to comply with the
obligation of paying royalties on the use of foreign patents.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Envoy: Election Crucial to Albania Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The international mediator Franz
Vranitzky said here today that a free and fair election "is of
great significance to the stability in Albania."
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky, an envoy of the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), hoped that different political
forces in the country could cooperate to create a sound condition
for the parliamentary elections due by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
He said the OSCE and European Commission fully supported the
election and would send experts and observers there.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky, who is on a two-day visit to Albania, said after his
talks with Albanian President Sali Berisha that the political
parties had agreed to hold the election by the end of June, but
still differed on election procedure, and issues concerning the
media during the vote.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky unexpectedly cancelled a trip to the rebel-held
southern town of Vlore Thursday after talks with Berisha.
</P>
<P>
His spokeswoman, Melissa Fleming, said: "He wants to focus on
the situation here and on preparing for elections."
</P>
<P>
This is Vranitzky's third visit to Albania as an international
mediator.
</P>
<P>
Albania has been swept by two months of chaos after an
insurrection sparked by the collapse of get-rich-quick pyramid
"investment" schemes. Nearly 300 people have died.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky expressed the OSCE's support for the election
Wednesday, one day after the Italian-led multinational force
started its operations in Albania.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution on
March 25 authorizing the dispatch of a 6,000-member, Italian-led
multinational force for three months to protect relief operations
in Albania.
</P>
<P>
About 1,200 Italian, French and Spanish soldiers landed in
Albania Tuesday and began to take control of harbors, airports and
other main communication facilities.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- More and more community centers
are popping up in Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong
Province, providing local residents with at least 60 inexpensive
services ranging from babysitting and medical treatment to
electrical appliance repair and cleaning clogged drainpipes.
</P>
<P>
The city is encouraging people to spend their spare time
helping neighbors who don't have the time or the skills to take
care of household and family-related chores. One community center
reported that more than 1,000 people have been involved in
assisting nearly 40,000 residents in the area.
</P>
<P>
Community helpers include teachers, workers, doctors and
self-employed people, who fill out applications detailing what
types of services they can provide.
</P>
<P>
"If people in trouble call us, we will arrange for our staff to
help them," said Hu Xiaoling, head of a service center, adding
that the charge is quite small.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the city bureau of civil affairs show that 87
percent of neighborhood committees have set up centers to lend a
hand to the disabled and the elderly, and more than 60,000 young
people have participated.
</P>
<P>
After six months' training guided by volunteer physicians,
Huang Xiaoli, a 27-year-old woman whose right leg is deformed, was
able to ride a bike. She gained fresh confidence and got a job in
a dressmaking factory.
</P>
<P>
The city government recently decided to allocate 500,000 yuan
per year to boost community services, and a local welfare fund
contributed one million yuan to aid construction of
facilities. Enitem

<HEADLINE> Experts Warn of Surplus Motorcycle Production Capacity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Latest statistics show that
China's motorcycle production capacity reached 14.89 million by
1995, 50 percent higher than the planned capacity for the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
The statistics from the State Statistics Bureau (SSB) said that
there are still 22 motorcycle projects under construction at
present, with expected production capacity of 3.83 million
motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
Experts thus warned firms to keep sober minded and stop
investing in motorcycle production.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, a lot of local governments set the
sector as the backbone and new driving force for their economic
development, expecting bumper profits.
</P>
<P>
Their overinput brought the number of motorcycle factories to
139 in 1996 from about 20.
</P>
<P>
In the January-August period in 1996, the business volume in
this sector decreased by 31.6 percent over the same period the
previous year, while their taxes and profits dropped by 87.3
percent. Illegal competition also occured on the market.
</P>
<P>
The SSB said that most of the current motorcycle projects under
construction are small-scale ones whose annual production capacity
would be lower than 200,000 motorcycles. The low level techniques
will also impact the market prospects for these firms.
</P>
<P>
Another survey by the SSB show that in 1996, every 100 urban
households have six motorcycles. In 1993, the figure was 3.5.

<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese inspection officials are
urging nationwide efforts to halt the entry of a bee-like insect
called the Mediterranean Fruit Fly into the country, as it may
cause mammoth economic losses for fruit growers, "China Daily"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Inspection officials of the Tianjin Branch of the China
Administration of Animal and Plant Quarantine (CAAPQ) confiscated
five oranges carried in by a Belarusan passenger from Minsk at
Tianjin's international airport last month.
</P>
<P>
Five Medflies were found inside the oranges, the official said.
</P>
<P>
China previously found Medflies at least six times at its
customs locations in southern areas over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
CAAPQ is making efforts to strengthen its inspections across
the country with relevant official departments and expects much
co-operation from traders and passengers who declare their
agricultural products for quarantine inspection.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the Medfly has already spread to more than 80
countries and regions in the world, although it is relatively new
to China.
</P>
<P>
The Medfly eats more than 250 kinds of fruits and vegetables. A
pair of male and female Medflies can reproduce 200 million eggs
within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
The world's scientists have not yet found an effective way to
kill the Medfly.

<P>
LONDON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Beijing-born Jing Jun-hong led
Singapore to its first Commonwealth title after beating England
4-2 in Glascow on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Jing overcame England's top player Lisa Lomas in the second
encounter of the evening and later sealed her adopted country's
triumph by beating the English national champion Nicola Deaton.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the Singaporeans had been given a good start by Tan
Paey Fern, who halted a great recovery by the former English
national champion Andrea Holt.
</P>
<P>
Although the 21-year-old Deaton pulled off a surprise win over
Li Ping Koh to reduce the deficit to 2-1, Jing and Tan proved to
canny for Lomas and Holt in the doubles, setting up the chance for
Jing to apply the coup de grace.
</P>
<P>
England earlier won back the men's title they captured in
Hyderabad, India three years ago after by beating India 4-1.

<HEADLINE> Scholar Calls for Translation of More Foreign Literature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A noted Chinese scholar says that
the country should continue to introduce foreign literature into
China.
</P>
<P>
"The work will help Chinese readers enjoy and study foreign
culture, and help Chinese writers learn some modern ideas about
literary creation," said Shen Huihui, deputy-editor-in-chief of
the magazine "World Literature."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, she said that literary works from
some 120 countries have been translated into Chinese over the past
20 years, but that's still not enough.
</P>
<P>
"World Literature," the country's leading publication for
foreign literature, was founded by Lu Xun, China's literary
pioneer, in 1934. It was banned during the Cultural Revolution
(1966-76) when foreign literature was regarded as having a
corruptive influence on Chinese readers.
</P>
<P>
But the magazine resumed publication in the late 1970s when
China opened to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the magazine has introduced thousands of writers
throughout the world into China, said Shen, a Harvard University
graduate who now works at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences
(CASS).
</P>
<P>
Readers in developing countries have attached great importance
on Modernism, Post-modernism and folk literature, she noted.
</P>
<P>
For example, "Ulysess" by James Joyce has been translated by
one of Shen's colleagues.
</P>
<P>
And the recent focal point is the "literary explosion" in Latin
America, which Shen believed can inspire Chinese writers'
imagination and aspiration.
</P>
<P>
But she said that the work is hindered because the commercial
sector is more interested in popular works by writers like US
author Michael Crichton, who penned the thriller "Jurassic Park."
</P>
<P>
And like many of the Chinese magazines engaged in foreign
literature, a shortage of funding is the chief obstacle preventing
them from buying copyrights from foreign authors.
</P>
<P>
Chinese publishing houses print more than 1,000 titles of
translated books every year. The country publishes some 100,000
new books annually.
</P>
<P>
China bans the translation of books deemed to have violent or
pornographic content.

<HEADLINE> China Vigilant Against Medfly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese inspection officials are
urging nationwide efforts to halt the entry of a bee-like insect
called the Mediterranean Fruit Fly (Medfly) into the country.
</P>
<P>
They said that the insect may cause mammoth economic losses for
fruit growers, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The Administration of Animal and Plant Quarantine of China
(CAAPQ) has repeatedly confiscated Medfly-infested fruit carried
into China in passenger luggage through the country's ports in
recent years, an official at the administration noted.
</P>
<P>
Yang Weichang, director-general of CAAPQ's Tianjin branch said
that his inspection team found live Medflies inside five oranges
carried in by a Belarussian passenger from Minsk at Tianjin's
international airport.
</P>
<P>
China previously found Medflies at least six times at its
customs locations in southern areas over the past few years, while
the insect was seldom seen in the north until recently.
</P>
<P>
The Medfly eats more than 250 kinds of fruits and vegetables
and reproduces quickly. The world's scientists have not yet found
an effective way to kill the Medfly, which has already spread to
more than 80 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
"Once this kind of insect comes into China, it will not only
cause damage to the country's fruit production but will also
affect China's foreign trade," said Zhao San, an expert with
CAAPQ's Tianjin branch.

TOKYO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Tokyo police today arrested 21
people who shouted protests from the House of Councillors gallery
during Diet (parliament) deliberation on a bill to allow the
continued compulsory leasing of land in Okinawa for use by the
United States military.
</P>
<P>
The group ignored orders from House of Councillors President
Juro Saito to keep quiet. The protesters kept shouting for about
13 minutes and forced the upper house to interrupt deliberation
for five minutes, police said.
</P>
<P>
The protesters were taken into custody by parliamentary guards
later and delivered to police, who arrested them on the charge of
obstruction of business.
</P>
<P>
Diet business resumed following the melee, and the government
proposed bill became law after the upper house passed it.
</P>
<P>
The enacted revision of the 1952 law ensures that the
U.S. forces can continue to use lands owned by 3,000 people
scattered among 12 U.S. military facilities on Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
Okinawans were disappointed in the passage of the bill.
Demonstrations by lawyers and local residents were held in Tokyo
and Okinawa after the bill was enacted.

and candy manufacturing factory, a Cuban-French joint enterprise.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban president stressed that this is a direct result of
French investment in Cuba, and warned Francuba executives that
they must maintain their standards of quality to face any
competition.
</P>
<P>
Francuba vice-president Michel Villand, and the firm lawyer,
Stepahn Boujnah, praised the investors for their courage to face
the pressures exerted by the United States through the
Helms-Burton law. The law discourages investments and trade with
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The factory is designed to produce 2.5 tons of French-type
bread every day. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Women's Tennis Association
(WTA) said on Thursday that it was disappointed at the Wimbledon
committee's decision not to allocate equal prize money to men and
women at this year's championships.
</P>
<P>
The men's singles champion will win 415,000 pounds (673,000
U.S. dollars), while the women's top prize is 373,500 pounds
(606,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The WTA Tour's argument is that equal prize money should be
paid from the quarter-finals onwards.
</P>
<P>
"It's still the public's view that they prefer the men's
matches to the women's," Wimbledon chairman John Curry said,
hinting it was impossible to close the gap.
</P>
<P>
Total prize money has risen by 6.5 percent to 6.88 million
pounds (11.2 million U.S. dollars) and for the first time
incorporates "per diem" payments to players in the qualifying
tournament.

<HEADLINE> Information, Imaging Technology Takes Big Strides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The information and imaging
technology has made great strides over the past few years with the
joint efforts of computer companies and imaging equipment makers.
</P>
<P>
The annual exhibition of the Association for Information and
Image Management International, which closed here at the Center of
New York today, further broadened people's view scope of how
modern technology is changing the way of information flow and
management.
</P>
<P>
Marry Lurie, one of the organizing officials of the show, said
that the changing nature of the use and value of information makes
its timely delivery and analysis a business imperative.
</P>
<P>
More than 340 companies seem to have brought such a message to
the show that turning tons of static sheets of paper or microfilms
into images which can be edited and sent about through computer
systems is no longer a tough issue.
</P>
<P>
The New Jersey-based Panasonic U.S. Company displayed its
latest high-speed color scanner, which can scan 40 pages a minute
and has a one million page duty cycle. Its resolution ranges
between 150 and 300 dots per inch, with a 256-level grayscale.
</P>
<P>
Microfilm scanning and printing system has become even more
compact in size and powerful in function. The MS-500 produced by
Canon U.S.A. Inc. can easily read and transfer microfilm images
into personal computers. It can be connected directly to a laseer
printer to print out images the user has selected. With the help
of OCR software, images can even be edited and transferred to
other computers.
</P>
<P>
Another dramatic characteristic is the rapid progress in the
data storage on compact discs (CD) with more efficient CD
recording machines being produced.
</P>
<P>
Higher resolution digital cameras coupled with color printers
or copy machines have turned mass production of high quality
digital images an easy job.
</P>
<P>
Software companies are turning out power weapons for document
capture, storage, retrieval, display, workflow and management, all
of which are highly automated.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said at least 35,000 visitors had appeared at the
show.

</P>
<P>
To further develop the healthy economic and trade relations
between China and the U.S. is not only in the basic interests of
the people of the two countries, but also to contribute to the
political stability and economic prosperity of Asia and the world,
the head of the Chinese delegation said.
</P>
<P>
Sun also stressed at a luncheon speech that the Chinese and the
U.S. economics are highly complementary and the U.S. is able to
play extensive roles in the process of China's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The topics discussed at the seminar included seeking of
information on the Chinese market and distribution stategies,
invitation of foreign business to the Chinese market and efforts
to find trade and joint venture chances.
</P>
<P>
Li Decheng, executive vice mayor of Shenzhen, which has a
sister city relations with Houston, introduced the economic
situation in the city and invited Houston trade groups to increase
their investment and trade in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> US Says NATO-Russia Deal Not Completed, Date for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States said today
that the date for signing a document between the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) and Russia has yet to be fixed since
the negotiations have not been finalized.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Russian President Boris Yeltsin said after
meeting German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the German city of
Baden-Baden that an agreement governing relations between Russia
and the alliance will be signed in May.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Michael McCurry told reporters that "we
are, obviously, continuing to work very hard with other members of
the alliance to finalize a charter document" with Russia.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that such an agreement would be "truly historic."
"There will need to be an appropriate occasion to finalize that
charter," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The venue has not been determined, nor the date, because among
other things, the charter itself hasn't been finished," McCurry
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a separate regular news briefing, State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns said, "The negotiations have not been
completed, and so we can't cite a victory before we have it."
</P>
<P>
"We haven't decided quite where a conference would be between
Russia and NATO, but if we do work out an agreement, we'll
certainly schedule one and late May would be very good timing
indeed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that a NATO-Russia agreement could be signed on
May 27 in Paris. Kohl also indicated that 90 percent of the
document has been completed and a full agreement will be finalized
before May 27.

<HEADLINE> US Senate Agrees to Vote on Chemical Weapons Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate unanimously
agreed today to vote on the ratification of the Chemical Weapons
Convention (CWC) on April 24.
</P>
<P>
The convention, signed by 161 countries and ratified by 70,
will take effect with or without the United States on April 29. If
the Senate fails to approve it, the U.S. will fail to participate
the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has launched a campaign to persuade
senators to pass the treaty before it takes effect while opponents
led by Republican Senator Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, vowed to block it until last minute.
</P>
<P>
Three former U.S. defense secretaries today issued a joint
statement, urging the Senate to ratify the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Former defense secretaries William Perry, Harold Brown and
Eliott Richardson joined the current defense secretary, William
Cohen, in backing the treaty, which bans the development,
production, stockpiling, transfer and use of chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
"We firmly believe that U.S. ratification of the CWC will
contribute significantly to the security interests of the United
States and safety of our armed forces," the three former defense
secretaries in the brief statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement released by the Pentagon said, "In light of the
decision under President Reagan to get rid of the vast majority of
U.S. chemical weapons stockpiles, it is in our interests to
require other nations to do the same."
</P>
<P>
Also today, Chairman John Shalikashvili of the Pentagon Joint
Chiefs of Staff reiterated his appeal to the Senate for ratifying
the convention.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, four other former defense secretaries --
Dick Cheney, Caspar Weinberger, Donald Rumsfeld and James
Schlesinger -- urged the Senate not to ratify the treaty, arguing
that the treaty is not in the interests of the U.S.

<HEADLINE> US Says No More Food Aid for DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States will not
provide any more food aid to the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) in spite of its new demand for international
assistance to meet the severe food shortage, U.S. officials said
today.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters that
the United States had already provided 25 million dollars in rice
and grain for the DPRK's food shortage since February this year,
and would not consider to pledge more.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has done what it can in committing to 25
million dollars in food aid. I am not aware of any initiative with
the State Department or the U.S. government to try to see if we
would ratchet that up," he said at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
Burns again denied there were any links between the food aid
and a U.S.-South Korean proposal for four-party peace talks,
saying, "We don't believe it is wise to link questions of food
delivery with political questions."
</P>
<P>
DPRK officials held a meeting Wednesday in New York with U.S.
and South Korean officials over the U.S.-South Korean proposal.
Both sides agreed that the meeting would adjourn Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Charles
Kartman, the most senior American representative at the talks in
New York, the DPRK officials appeared ready to accept the
proposal, but they were also demanding more food aid.
</P>
<P>
"The North Koreans have raised over and over again that their
highest priority is food, and we have raised again and again our
desire that they participate in the peace talks," Kartman told
members of a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee.

other walls were blown out. One of the cars across the street was
flipped," one witness was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> White House Hosts Child Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Hillary Rodham Clinton today hosted an early child development
conference.
</P>
<P>
Child care soon emerged as a key issue at the White House
Conference on Early Childhood Development and Learning, which was
beamed to 92 locations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
T. Berry Brazelton, a pediatrician and author who charged the
president and lawmakers, "turned the wrong way" on welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
"We should have looked at what we were going to do with
children before we pushed women out into the workplace. It's so
obvious to anybody," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Harvard Medical School professor was one of several experts
criticizing government shortcomings that ranged from a lack of
universal health care for children, inadequate prenatal and
post-partus counseling for women to a general lack of support for
parents.
</P>
<P>
David Hamburg, president of the Carnegie Corp. of New York,
said, "The fact is our nation's infants and toddlers are in
trouble."
</P>
<P>
Clinton agreed a more "systematic" approach was needed to
ensure basic services and said federal research was needed to
determine such things as how much interactive time a parent should
spend with an infant.

<HEADLINE> US Says Date for Signing NATO-Russia Not Fixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States said today
that the date for signing a document between the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) and Russia has yet to be fixed since
the negotiations have not been finalized.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Russian President Boris Yeltsin said after
meeting German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the German city of
Baden-Baden that an agreement governing relations between Russia
and the alliance will be signed in May in Paris.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Michael McCurry told reporters that "we
are, obviously, continuing to work very hard with other members of
the alliance to finalize a charter document" with Russia.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that such an agreement would be "truly historic."
"There will need to be an appropriate occasion to finalize that
charter," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The venue has not been determined, nor the date, because among
other things, the charter itself hasn't been finished," McCurry
said.

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto to Visit Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto will make a working visit to Washington next
week, the White House announced today.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto was reported to bring "welcome news" to President
Bill Clinton: Japan has enacted a law giving the government
authority to force property owners to lease land for U.S. military
bases on Okinawa in accordance with a security treaty between the
United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The law was approved less than a month before thousands of
leases expire on Okinawa, which hosts two-thirds of 47,000 U.S.
troops stationed in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Residents on Okinawa are increasingly opposed to U.S. military
presence as it brings noise and crime. In 1995, three U.S.
soldiers raped a 12-year-old Okinawan girl, which touched off
nationwide protests against American savagery, and Okinawans
demanded that U.S. troops go home.
