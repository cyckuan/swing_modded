<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Launches Economic Policy Analysis Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia launched Sunday a
program to assess the country's macro economic policy.
</P>
<P>
The program, called In-Country Program of the Ethiopian Macro
Economic Policy Analysis Capacity Building Project, was officially
launched in Nazareth, 90 km southeast of Addis Ababa, capital of
the east African country.
</P>
<P>
Opening the program, Vice-Minister of Economic Development and
Cooperation Mekonnen Manyazewal said the task of putting Ethiopia
back on the right track to economic and social development is well
underway.
</P>
<P>
He said that significant measures have been taken in building
the policy and institutional framework that will establish the
optimal and clear division of role between the market and state,
the Ethiopian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The future civil service involved in economic management is
expected to have a clear vision coming up with high quality output
that can lead to or influence policy and strategic changes," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Jemal Mohammed, director of the project, said the project will
address critical problems such as lack of adequate number of
skilled professionals, absence of the necessary analytical tools,
and a relatively high staff turnover.
</P>
<P>
He said the short-term training program will focus on 12
carefully selected training areas, adding that the training in
those selected areas will be delivered between April 1999 and
December 2001.
</P>
<P>
Some 22 experts drawn from the Ministry of Economic Development
and Cooperation, the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank of
Ethiopia are attending the first three-week training program.
</P>
<P>
The project is financed by the African Capacity Building
Foundation and the United Nations Development Program.
</P>
<P>
The School of Oriental and African Studies of the University of
London will provide the training.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia Agrees to Host More British, German Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian has agreed to allow
NATO to station additional British and German troops on its
territory, alliance spokesman Jamie Shea said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Macedonia only yesterday gave its consent, its agreement to
stationing of additional British and German troops," Shea said at
a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Shea said the British and German troops were originally planned
to take part in a NATO peacekeeping operation in Kosovo in the
event of a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
A German Defense Ministry source said Germany now has 3,200
troops in Macedonia and there is authorization from the Bundestag
to increase that number to 5,500.
</P>
<P>
Shea also told reporters that Romania and Slovenia have granted
NATO the use of air space for alliance military operations against
Yugoslavia and Bulgaria is expected to vote soon to give similar
permission.
</P>
<P>
"Romania and Slovenia have granted us access to their air space
for operations and I anticipate a vote by Bulgaria tomorrow along
the same lines," he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Asked to Persuade Israel to Backtrack on Closing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) on Sunday
asked the European Union to persuade Israel to rescind its
decision to close Palestinian offices in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
AL Assistant Secretary General Sa'ed Kamal told reporters that
the request was included in two urgent messages that the league
chief, Esmat Abdel-Meguid, sent to British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook and French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
AL officials said Kamal delivered the messages in the day to
the British and French ambassadors in Cairo when he met with them
separately.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid will send another message to German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer, whose country is holding the rotating
presidency of the European Union (EU) for the first half this
year, Kamal said.
</P>
<P>
The messages are part of an Arab drive to denounce the Israeli
closure decision which violates the agreements signed between the
Palestinians and the Israelis, the AL official said.
</P>
<P>
Israel decided days ago to close down several Palestinian
offices in East Jerusalem, including the Orient House and the
Palestinian Prisoners Club, citing that they have been working for
the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied the traditionally Arab East Jerusalem in the
1967 Mideast war and proclaimed in 1980 the whole city as its
"undivided and eternal capital."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of their
future independent state.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Ask EU for Economic Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Greece's Economy and Finance
Minister Yiannos Papantoniou said here Sunday that Athens would
ask the European Union (EU) to compensate for the country's
economic losses stemming from the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Papantoniou said that the repercussions of the Kosovo crisis on
the country's real economy and tourism would exist, but it would
not derail Greece's attempt to become the 13th member the European
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), the semi-official Athens News
Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Greece would be ready to meet all EMU criteria by the end of
1999, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government said recently that the Kosovo crisis has
already cost the Greek economy at least 200 billion drachmas
(about 666 million U.S. dollars), and would reduce the growth of
the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) by 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Deeply concerned with the falling trend in the country's
financial markets caused by the protracted war in Yugoslavia,
Greek industrialists will urge the Greek government to seek
immediate EMU accession.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Greece is the only EU country which fails to meet
the EMU criteria, but the country has done its utmost to join the
EMU in 2001.

<HEADLINE> UAE Reiterates Sovereignty Over Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Sunday reiterated its sovereignty over three disputed Gulf islands.
</P>
<P>
"The people of the UAE will not forget that the three islands
of Abu Musa, Greater and Lesser Tunbs are part of their
territories," said Mohammed Khalifa Al Habtour, speaker of the
Federal National Council.
</P>
<P>
Both UAE and Iran claimed sovereignty over the three islands,
which Iran took over in 1974 from Britain after the end of its
protectorate.
</P>
<P>
Iran has so far agreed to start negotiations only over Abu
Musa, which is located near strategic shipping lanes in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The dispute is a major barrier to the normalization of
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Al Habtour made the remark in meeting with Iranian Ambassador
Hussein Sadegi, who delivered a letter from Speaker of Iranian
Parliament Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, inviting him to attend the
founding meeting of the Islamic Parliamentary Union (ISPU) to be
held in Tehran on June 15-17.
</P>
<P>
Al Habtour stressed that the UAE had always been keen on
maintaining good ties with Arab, Islamic and friendly nations.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that Iran would respond positively to the
calls of the UAE to resolve the islands issue by peaceful means,
either through direct negotiations or by referring it to the
International Court of Justice in the Hague.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Yeltsin Discuss Kosovo Conflict on Phone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Russian President Boris Yeltsin discussed the Kosovo issue on
phone for an hour Sunday, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin briefed Clinton on Russia's mediation effort last week
to bring an end to the Kosovo conflict, White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's special envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin visited Belgrade,
but Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic did not make a
concession to NATO's demands.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said that during the conversation, Clinton reiterated
NATO's conditions to end the conflict.
</P>
<P>
At the current summit in Washington, NATO reiterated its
five-point demands to end the war, including withdrawal of Serb
forces from Kosovo and stationing in Kosovo of an international
military presence.
</P>
<P>
Hoping Russia to continue its mediation effort and play a
constructive role, President Clinton told Yeltsin that it's
constructive that he is involved and that he would stay personally
engaged with him, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
They did not talk about NATO's oil embargo against Yugoslavia,
a suggestion strongly opposed by Russia.

<HEADLINE> U.S., British Warplanes Continue Attacks on Iraqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and British warplanes on
Sunday continued their attacks on Iraqi civilian facilities and
military sites, an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 14:10 (1010 GMT) 10 formations of
enemy warplanes coming from Turkish airspace violated northern
Iraqi airspace over Erbil, Dohuk and Mosul provinces.
</P>
<P>
The enemy planes bombed civilian facilities and military
sites, causing heavy damages on properties, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraqi air defenses fired back and forced
the enemy planes to flee to their base in Turkey at 17:10
(1310 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Fifteen formations of enemy warplanes coming from Saudi and
Kuwaiti bases also violated southern Iraqi airspace at 14:00
(1000 GMT) over Samawa, Nasiriya and Diwaniya provinces, said
the spokesman, adding that Iraqi air defenses repulsed these
enemy planes at 16:40 (1240 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-December U.S. and British air strikes against
Iraq, clashes between U.S. and British jets patrolling the
no-fly zones and the Iraqi air defenses have almost become
daily occurrence.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in
Iraq following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in
the south from "Baghdad's suppression."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has declared that it does not recognize these
restricted zones and vowed to continue confronting any allied
plane violating its airspace.

<HEADLINE> Israel Closes Palestinian Office in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel's police Sunday closed
a Palestinian office in the eastern Jerusalem, citing that
it has worked for the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
The order to shut down the Palestinian Prisoners Club, which
was representing the rights of Palestinian prisoners, was issued
by Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani.
</P>
<P>
Police locked the office door and posted the order prohibiting
any entry into the room.
</P>
<P>
This is the first Israeli action after the government decided
days ago to close down PNA offices in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The office is located near the Orient House which has also been
ordered to shut down on charges of serving as the Palestinian
headquarters in the eastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
At first, the Israeli government decided at the end of last
month to close three Palestinian offices in Jerusalem, which it
said were representing the PNA.
</P>
<P>
But the Israeli government later rescinded the closure order
against the Jerusalem branch of the Palestinian news agency WAFA
since the agency had been accredited by the Israeli Government
Press Office.
</P>
<P>
And about two weeks ago, the lawyers of the Palestinian
Prisoners Club and the Palestinian office dealing with Christian
affairs, which was also on the closure list, reached an agreement
with the Israeli Public Security Ministry. The lawyers declared
that the two offices were not working on behalf of the PNA and
will not do so in the future.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said on Sunday that the Palestinian Prisoners
Club was shut down since it has violated the agreement with the
government.
</P>
<P>
Israel has insisted that Jerusalem is its indivisible and
eternal capital, while the Palestinians want as their future
capital. According to the peace agreements signed by the two
sides, the issue of Jerusalem should be settled in the final
status talks.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has taken
tougher measures against the Palestinian activities in Jerusalem.
He also ordered the closure of the Orient House last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials dismissed the move as electioneering
ahead of the Israeli general elections on May 17. They also
reiterated that the Orient House and other Palestinian offices
in the eastern Jerusalem were not working for the PNA.

bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad Ibn Jassim Bin
Jabir Al-Thani extended the invitation on behalf of Emir Sheikh
Hamad Ibn Khalifa Al-Thani.

</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that Qatar's future take-over of the
rotating chairmanship of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC) from Iran would serve to bring the two countries
closer.
</P>
<P>
Qatar will ascend the OIC chairmanship next year according to
the decision of the OIC summit in Tehran in December 1997.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Warns of Peace Process Collapsing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- A Sinn Fein leader warned Sunday
the peace process in Northern Ireland was in a "very deep crisis"
and every day there was a failure to find agreement the crisis
deepened.
</P>
<P>
Mitchel McLaughlin, chairman of Sinn Fein, the political wing
of the IRA, said: "If you `park' the peace process there will be
no Good Friday Agreement to come back to. It will be gone. There
will be nothing to come back to."
</P>
<P>
He issued the warning after one option emerged that the peace
process was put on hold -- "parking" it -- until the tensions
created by the European elections and the summer marching season
are over.
</P>
<P>
"We know what the loyalists are going to do this marching
season, everybody knows. There could be members of this assembly
dead by the time this summer is over as a result of the activities
of those people," McLaughlin said.
</P>
<P>
"You can't afford even to consider for a moment parking the
peace process," he told BBC One's On the Record program.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's leading politicians will sit down again
Monday in an attempt to break the deadlock over the
decommissioning in the province.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart,
Bertie Ahern, are on standby to join the discussions later in the
week if there are signs of breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
The deadlock came about after Northern Ireland's First Minister
David Trimble refused to share power with Sinn Fein until the IRA
had begun decommissioning its weapons.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein insists it cannot deliver such a deal and does not
need to hand over arms under the Good Friday Agreement which was
reached one year ago.

<HEADLINE> hke042522 - Taliban, Pakistan to Hold Talks on Major Gas Pipeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Taliban senior official in
charge of mines and industries Maulvi Ahmed Jan Sunday arrived
here for talks with Pakistan on a proposed 2-billion-U.S.-dollar
gas pipeline project.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban official will open talks with Pakistani officials
on April 28 to discuss various options to step up work on the
project which will transport gas to Pakistan from Turkmenistan via
Afghanistan, Pakistani officials said.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides will chalk out strategy for the proposed meeting
of senior officials of Pakistan, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan
shortly," said the officials.
</P>
<P>
The planned 1,280-kilometer, 48-inch diameter gas pipeline will
connect Dauletabad gas field in Southeastern Turkmenistan with
Multan in eastern Pakistani province of Punjab.
</P>
<P>
Twenty billion cubic meters of gas will be transported from
Turkmenistan to Pakistan through the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Petroleum Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan and
Turkmen Foreign Minister Sheikh Boris Muradov in a meeting last
month had agreed to convene a meeting of officials from the three
countries to have further discussions on the project.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Turkmenistan signed a deal with an eight-member
international consortium led by American UNOCAL, which comprised
the Turkmen government, Delta of Saudi Arabia, Itochu of Japan,
Gazprom of Russia, INPEX of Japan, Hyundai of South Korea and
Crescent of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Later, the UNOCAL pulled out of the consortium because of
continuous hostilities in Afghanistan and pressure from the U.S.
government which was against Taliban's support to Osama bin Laden,
who was labeled by the U.S. as the most wanted terrorist.
</P>
<P>
After UNOCAL's withdrawal, the Taliban entered into
negotiations with Bridas company of Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The proposed pipeline, the first major economic investment in
Afghanistan since 1979, will run through the west and south of the
country, currently under the Taliban's control.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and Turkmenistan are very interested in the early
construction of the project, but instability in Afghanistan is the
main hurdle.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Reform Training Colleges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has reached
an advanced stage in its plan to reform the training colleges and
institutions in the country to make them more viable and
self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Science, Technology and Vocational Training,
Alfeyo Hambayi, said here Sunday that an independent body will be
set up to run the institutions and colleges.
</P>
<P>
Continued lack of funds to run the training institutions will
be addressed because each institution will have a management board
to carry out the daily operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said a law has been passed by the country's parliament and
the government is now putting up the board, which will be
operational in few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The government released money to his ministry three weeks ago
to avert premature closure of training colleges, according to the
minister.
</P>
<P>
"I'm grateful that three weeks ago the government released
enough money to enable colleges and training institutions end
their calender normally," said Hambayi.

<HEADLINE> Europe's Leftist Parties Urge NATO to End Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of 25 left-wing
political parties from 15 European countries Sunday called for an
end to the bombing raids by NATO against Yugoslavia and the
immediate start of talks for a political solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution passed here by the representatives attending a
peace conference on Kosovo, they also called for an end to all
hostilities, attacks and violations of human rights in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The representatives stressed that a political settlement of the
conflict should be found on the basis of a wide autonomy for
Kosovo and within the framework of the United Nations and the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which opened Friday, is being organized on the
initiative of Greece's Coalition of the Left. Among those
attending the conference were Armando Cossutta, leader of the
Party of Italian Communists, Lothar Biski, president of the German
Democratic Socialist Party, and Jovan Lazarev, secretary-general of
the Socialist Party of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of protesters Sunday formed a "human
shield" around a building used by the U.S. radio broadcaster Voice
of America in Greece's northwest town of Xanthi, in protest
against the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia which started on March 24.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Immigrant Bureau Chief Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Immigrant Liaison
Bureau chief Ya'acov Kedmi resigned again on Sunday over
differences with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the issue
of the Jews of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Kedmi, who accused Netanyahu of deserting the Jews of the
former Soviet Union and making a fool of himself in dealing with
the issue of Russian immigrants, made public his bitter battle
with Netanyahu on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The local television Channel One on Friday released portions of
a resignation letter that Kedmi sent to Netanyahu at the end of
November last year, in which he criticized Natanyahu's policy
toward Russian immigrants as "chaotic" and "irresponsible."
</P>
<P>
Kedmi complained that since being named the head of the bureau
(also called "Native" in Hebrew) a year and a half earlier, he had
not been invited even once for talks with the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"You have...neglected the duties of the State of Israel,"
wrote Kedmi.
</P>
<P>
He added that while former prime ministers had helped Nativ
successfully bring the Jews of the Soviet Union to Israel,
Netanyahu had actually stifled the process.
</P>
<P>
Leaking of the letter came on the day when visiting Russian
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov held meetings with Netanyahu in
Jerusalem about improving relations between Russian and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Natanyahu's office sharply criticized Kedmi for doing this.
In a statement issued on Saturday, it accused Kedmi of helping
Netanyhau's enemies.
</P>
<P>
The office also said that Kedmi "is trying to make prime
minister look bad in the eyes of the Russian community on
the eve of elections."
</P>
<P>
The Nativ acts as a liaison between Israel and Jews in
the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
In the Israeli general elections on May 17, 120 members of
the Knesset (parliament) and a new prime minister will be elected.
</P>
<P>
The bitter battle between Kedmi and Netanyahu would cause some
political damage to Netanyahu, who is trying his best to
to be elected into a next term of office.

<HEADLINE> Rockets Retain Title at Chinese Basketball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, Zhejiang Province, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Defending
champions Bayi Rockets swept Liaoning Hunters 3-0 after scoring a
110--96 victory in the third game of the best-of-five finals at
the 1998-99 season of the Chinese First Division Basketball League
here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth consecutive title for Bayi Rockets, who won
the previous two games by 108-104 and 116-103.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Hunters have been the runners-up to the Rockets in all
the first four seasons of the 12-team Chinese League which started
in the year of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Bayi kept a clean record at home in Ningbo this season after
Sunday's victory.
</P>
<P>
"Bayi are real heroes in Chinese Basketball," said Bayi head
coach Wang Fei. "Mentally, everybody in the championship team is
the MVP."
</P>
<P>
Bayi's 7-feet center Wang Zhizhi, who scored game-high 29
points and grabbed 13 boards, was another step towards his first
MVP award after lifting his team to this title.
</P>
<P>
"This is the best game we have played in the finals," said
Liaoning head coach Wu Qinglong. "I hope Liaoning could do much
better next year."
</P>
<P>
Without starting power forward Liu Yudong, who was banned for
the third game of the finals after pushing Hunters' guard Guo
Shiqiang on the neck in the second game, Bayi held off Liaoning's
big surge-up at the start of the second quarter to keep their lead
59-51 at the break.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhizhi dominated not only the inside game against Hunters
two American centers, but also sank three pointer to cap a 14-0
run for Bayi and made it eight points lead to head into the second
half.
</P>
<P>
Hunters moved as close as 83-80 at the beginning of the third
quarter, but Bayi pulled away on forward Zhang Jinsong's two three-
pointers, which sparkled a 8-0 run to seal the win.

<HEADLINE> NATO Promises Aid to Yugoslav Neighbors for Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- NATO leaders gathered with the
heads of seven countries neighboring Yugoslavia Sunday, the final
day of its 50th anniversary summit, to map a strategy for the
political and economic reconstruction of the Balkans after the
Kosovo war is over.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that Belgrade is on defense against the
present NATO bombing raids and its possible ground invasion, NATO
leaders are trying to convince Yugoslavia's neighbors that they
might be attacked and NATO will protect them.
</P>
<P>
"The nations of the region have risked and even faced armed
confrontation with Serbia by facilitating and supporting our
campaign to end the bloodshed in Kosovo," U.S. President Bill
Clinton said in opening remarks to the gathering.
</P>
<P>
"If Belgrade challenges its neighbors as a result of the
presence of NATO, we will respond," he said.
</P>
<P>
Attending the gathering were leaders of Albania, Bosnia,
Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Romania and Slovenia, and 19 NATO
leaders.
</P>
<P>
In order to retain support from these countries for its
long-drawn airstrikes and to ask them to help absorb potentially
destabilizing refugee flow, the alliance promised to provide
economic assistance to these neighbors of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said NATO allies were committed to working with them
and with multilateral financial institutions to ease their
emergency needs and help them in settlement of debts.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said no detailed plan for aid is likely to
emerge from the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Some NATO members have made clear they intended to undertake a
rebuilding program only for Kosovo. Macedonia and Albania would
also be likely beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
Germany has called for a project on the scale of the Marshall
plan that helped rebuild Europe after World War Two and suggested
European Union membership should eventually be offered to Balkan
countries.
</P>
<P>
The cost of rebuilding the region is certain to run into
billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia last week tallied the damage it had sustained at 100
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
NATO leaders will meet some 23 leaders of former Soviet bloc
countries and neutral European countries later Sunday under the
alliance's Partnership for Peace program.

<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Shenhua finally snapped
their winless record in the Worker Sports Stadium, the home pitch
of Beijing Guo'an, in the five-year-old Chinese soccer league on
Sunday.

<P>
Shenhua beat Guo'an 1-0 on striker Qi Hong's header with five
minutes left on the clock in the league derby.
</P>
<P>
This is the first league and cup victory for the visiting
Shenhua in the capital since China started its professional
football leagues in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Shenhua climbed to the third place in the league standings with
10 points, four points trailing the leaders Sichuan Quanxing, and
three less than Liaoning Fushun.
</P>
<P>
The top two teams also packed victories as Quanxing disposed
off the bottom Tianjin Taida 2-1, and Liaoning defeated Guangzhou
Songri 1-0, both on home fields.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao called on
localities to intensify their flood control efforts in order to
have a safe flood season this year.
</P>
<P>
Wen, also head of the State Flood Control and Drought Relief
Headquarters, spoke at the first plenary session of Headquarters
held recently.
</P>
<P>
The year 1999 will be a very important year in the Chinese
history, and therefore doing a good job in flood control and
drought relief this year is of special significance, he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting summarized experiences and lessons drawn in the
past in this aspect, studied this year's flood control and drought
relief situations as well as outstanding problems, and put forward
measures to cope with any possible flooding along major rivers
like the Yangtze and the Yellow.
</P>
<P>
China suffered heavy floods, which were rarely seen in the
Chinese history, along the Yangtze River in the south and along
the Songhua and Nenjiang Rivers in the north. Under the leadership
of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people worked with one
heart and one mind and achieved great successes in combating the
floods and reduced the losses, both in people's lives and public
and private properties, to a minimum.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Dependence on Agriculture, Mining Criticised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Director of Zimbabwe Investment
Center Nicholas Ncube Sunday attributed the lack of progress in
the economy to the national economic structure characterized by
heavy dependence on agriculture and mining for export earnings.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a business seminar in Bulawayo, the country's second
largest city, Ncube said the economy seemed to be deteriorating
further despite efforts to improve the business climate and the
welfare of the citizens through economic reforms, the Zimbabwe
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said this was evidenced by the continued increase in prices
of basic commodities and the devaluation of the country's
currency.
</P>
<P>
"Earnings from major commodities such as tobacco and gold have
not reached expected levels over the past few years on the
international market, " he said.
</P>
<P>
"This has deprived the country of much needed foreign currency
to sustain our balance of payments position. We should note that
we also have not carried the reform program to the full," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the delay by the International Monetary Fund in
injecting additional support had made the situation more critical
as it was causing other donors to hold back assistance to
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Ncube suggested that the country should shift its focus and
engage in activities that generated constant flow of foreign
currency.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the South
African Nobel Peace Prize laureate, was honored with a German
prize Sunday in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
The Dietrich-Bonhoeffer Prize, named after a German theologian
who opposed the Nazi regime and was hanged by the Nazis in 1945,
was awarded for Tutu's role as chairman of the South African Truth
and Reconciliation Commission (TRC).
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a church service at the French Cathedral in
Berlin, Tutu thanked German churches for their support to his work
during South Africa's apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
"Our victory is also your victory," Tutu said.
</P>
<P>
The prize belongs to all the South African people, he said,
adding, "My people are incredibly wonderful."
</P>
<P>
A statement of the Kaiser/Guetersloher publishing firm, which
funded the prize, said the TRC under Tutu's leading had enabled
the longed-for reconciliation in South Africa and initiated the
unity of a democratic country.
</P>
<P>
Tutu said the victims of apartheid have forgiven the apartheid
perpetrator, and "the world now finds out (in South Africa)
something else than revenge."
</P>
<P>
But South Africa probably needs generations of time to heal all
the wounds that apartheid policy has left for the country, Deputy
Chairman of the TRC Reverend Alex Borraine said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Denies Intention to Send Peace-keeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Sunday categorically denied
a foreign media report that it is one of some countries intending
to send its peace-keeping troops to the war-torn Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Acting Information Minister and chief government spokesman,
Bennie Mwiinga, dismissed the report as "false" and "incorrect".
</P>
<P>
Local Government and Housing Minister Mwiinga said his country
is concentrating on mediation efforts and trying to find a
peaceful solution to the nine-month conflict in DRC.
</P>
<P>
He said that President Frederick Chiluba, who has been mandated
by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to mediate a
peaceful solution, has continued and will continue to exert all
his energy to work with his colleagues in the region to find a
lasting and peaceful solution acceptable to all the parties in
DRC.
</P>
<P>
He said when a general need arises to send the peace-keeping
forces Zambian people will be informed accordingly.
</P>
<P>
One week ago DRC President Laurent Kabila and his Ugandan
counterpart Yoweri Museveni signed an agreement in Libya, which
provides for an immediate cessation of hostilities, deployment of
an all-African peace- keeping force among others.
</P>
<P>
Libya and Eritrea which also attended the Four-nation Summit
one week ago have already volunteered to be part of the proposed
peace-keeping forces.

is losing the war and NATO is winning it.
</P>
<P>
As soon as everything is ready, Apache helicopters, which are
known as tank killers in the West, will be put into action, Clark
said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the U.S. forces in Albania, Martin Downley,
declined to answer questions on the purpose of Clark's visit, the
second in less than 10 days.
</P>
<P>
During Sunday's visit, he did not meet with Albanian leaders
and defense officials.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian news agency ATA said that this visit by Clark came
at a time when NATO is reinforcing its troops in Albania and
Macedonia and has yet to decide to send ground forces into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Western military alliance, embarrassed with its failure to
make Milosevic bow after a month of massive air strikes, was
reportedly planning to launch a ground invasion into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of Apache helicopters was a step closer to a NATO
ground operation.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Kosovo Group Wants to Act as Guide for NATO Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The illegal Kosovo military group,
the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), proposed Sunday to act as the
guide for NATO troops when NATO launches a ground operation in
Kosovo, the southern Serbian republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman, who identified himself as Leopard Husi, made the
proposal at the group's first press conference in Kukes, a city in
northern Albania.
</P>
<P>
If the KLA, which is seen as a terrorist organization by
Yugoslavia, provides guide for NATO troops, casualties can be
reduced on the side of NATO, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He asked NATO to supply the KLA with modern weapons and arms.
</P>
<P>
With better weapons and NATO's Apache tank-killer helicopters
in action, he said, he believes the KLA will be able to offer
better assistance to NATO troops in ground offensives against the
Serb army.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the KLA is in action in a wide area in
Kosovo. But he refused to elaborate on how many fighters the KLA
has and which areas in Kosovo are under its control.
</P>
<P>
Another KLA spokesman, Gani Sylaj, said at the press conference
that the situation in Kosovo is extremely grave and the Kosovo
crisis can be solved only through close cooperation between NATO
and the KLA.
</P>
<P>
The KLA is short of modern weapons and logistical support, he
said.
</P>
<P>
NATO, embarrassed with its failure to make Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to bow after a month-long extensive bombing on
Yugoslavia, was reportedly planning to launch a ground invasion
into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
It was widely speculated that NATO, in a ground operation in
Kosovo, will use the KLA to fight a way into Kosovo with support
of NATO air power and NATO troops will move on the KLA's
footprints to avoid direct confrontation with Serb soldiers.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) Sunday pledged to provide security umbrella
for the countries neighboring Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
As NATO's summit is closing, leaders from the 19-member
alliance and Albania, Bulgaria, the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, Romania and Slovenia, Bosnia and Croatia met about two
hours Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting expressed support for the territorial integrity
and sovereignty of all states in the region," a press communique
said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
NATO leaders said that "the security of the neighboring states
was of direct and material concern" to the alliance members.
</P>
<P>
They promised that "NATO would respond to challenges by
Belgrade to the neighboring states resulting from the presence of
NATO forces and their activities on their territory during
crisis," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, U.S. President Bill Clinton said that
NATO wanted to strengthen its security bonds with the countries
and look forward to Croatia and Bosnia joining the Partnership for
Peace program.
</P>
<P>
NATO forces were using military facilities in the countries to
conduct the current air campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the U.S. and its allies have attempted to
break up Yugoslavia for the past decade to prevent the emerging of
a great Serbia which may say no to them. Strengthening relations
with Yugoslavia's neighboring countries is part of the alliance's
strategy.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Teens Wanted to Kill 500, Hijack Plane: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The two U.S. students who
killed 13 people at a high school wanted to kill at least 500
others, attack nearby homes and then hijack a plane and crash it
into New York City, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
Local county sheriff John Stone told reporters the goal of the
teenage killers, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, was to strike
during the busy lunch hour to go for "a big kill".
</P>
<P>
In an interview published Monday in The Denver Post, Stone said
the gunmen's diary indicates that if they survived, they wanted to
"hijack an airplane and crash it into a major city".
</P>
<P>
"When they burned the school down, then they were just going to
start ravaging the neighborhood, killing as many people as they
could," Stone told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The two gunmen took their own lives after they killed 12
students and one teacher.
</P>

On Sunday, Vice President Al Gore attended the memorial service
in Kolorado for those killed in Kolorado State, which brought as

<HEADLINE> Israel Issues Warning Orders on Office Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police Monday handed
over warning orders to Palestinian officials at the Orient House
in East Jerusalem, stating three offices inside the building will
be closed.
</P>
<P>
The Orient House lawyer Jawad Boulos said the office of Faisal
Husseini, Minister for Jerusalem Affairs, is on the blacklist.
</P>
<P>
Boulos said Israel's Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani
warned that he will close the three offices for their cooperation
with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and gave 48 hours
for the Palestinian side to appeal against the closure.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with his lawyers and other representatives on
Monday, Husseini warned that Israel's closure of the offices in
the Orient House will not only lead to unrest in Jerusalem, but
also in the whole region.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a
security cabinet meeting to discuss what measures it could take
against the Orient House, which Israel alleged has recently been
used by Palestinian officials for organizing political and
diplomatic activities.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the security cabinet decided to close down
offices run by Palestinians in the Orient House, which is actually
a representative office of the PNA in the East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The decision came a day after Husseini received low-level
diplomats in the building.
</P>
<P>
Israel closed two Palestinian offices in Jerusalem earlier this
month.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Local Newspapers Take Lead on China's Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey covering China's
60 major cities indicates that almost all the three most popular
newspapers for local readers are local papers.
</P>
<P>
That shows that local newspapers have already taken the leading
position on local markets, on the contrary, the influence of
national newspapers has weakened, analyzed experts with the
Central Viewer and Consulting Center, which conducted the survey.
</P>
<P>
For instance, most readers in Beijing prefer Beijing Evening
Post, Beijing Daily and Beijing Youth Daily, however, national
newspapers issued in this political and cultural center of China
are less popular for local residents.
</P>
<P>
The survey involved 89 national newspaers and 709 local ones,
with a total of 71,000 samples.
</P>
<P>
It also reveals that people in different cities are quite
different in reading newspapers. For example, residents in
Hangzhou are most favorite in reading, who read 2.33 newspapers
each on the average every day, however, people in Fuzhou only read
0.32 newspapers each.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The world athletics governing body
the International Athletics Federation (IAAF) has decided that
Mary Decker Slaney of the United States should be banned for two
years for positive doping test.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement from the IAAF on Monday, the IAAF
Arbitration Panel concluded Sunday that Slaney was guilty of a
doping offence on June 17, 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The USTAF's Doping Hearing Board decision of 16 September 1997
was erroneous. Accordingly the athlete became ineligible to
compete for a minimum of two years from 17 June 1996," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
As a result of this decision, all results and awards that Mary
Decker Slaney may have obtained in competiton during her period of
ineligibility from June 17, 1996 to June 16, 1998 are to be
considered null and void.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that the Arbitration Panel's decision is
final.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Lawyers Urged to Tackle Difficult Issues of Public Concern (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- State Councilor Luo Gan called on
Chinese lawyers today to assist the government through legal means
to resolve various conflicts and contradictions now emerging all
across the country, in order to maintain social stability.
</P>
<P>
"Lawyers should take the initiative in providing efficient
legal services for address difficult issues of public concern
relating to economic progress and social stability," said Luo at
the 4th National Lawyers' Congress (NLC) which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Luo is also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China Central Committee and secretary of the Central
Political Science and Law Committee.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers should help workers laid-off from state-owned
enterprises (SOE) to protect their rights and interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
They should also focus their attention on reform of SEOs,
another round of 30-year land contracts now being signed across
the country, illegal and exorbitant burdens on farmers, and
financial reforms, Luo said.
</P>
<P>
The three-day NLC will formulate a unified charter of the All-
China Lawyers Association (ACLA), and elect new leadership for the
next four years.
</P>
<P>
According to Ren Jisheng, president of the 3rd ACLA, the
meeting will also discuss two major issues that are threatening
the development of and tarnishing the image of the legal
profession: protecting their rights and regulating their conduct.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian Agriculture
Ministry said on Monday that some 29,000 hectares of farmland have
been inundated in the country by overflowing rivers in eight
counties.
</P>
<P>
About 15,875 hectares of cropland in Mures county are under
water. In Alba, Hunedoara, Aramures, Harghita and Olt counties,
floods have swept thousands of hectares under wheat, corn,
potatoes, sugar beet, barley, rape and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 24 hours, water levels in southwestern Romania
have risen, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The water level of the Danube river crossing Romania is
reportedly on the rise, reaching 9,300 cubic meters per second,
according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Rainy weather this year affected 3,500 hectares in February and
March.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 92,400 hectares of farmland was hit by floods.

The number of violations of lawyers' rights and interests are
on the rise, especially when they serve as defense lawyers in
criminal cases, Ren said in his work report to the congress.
</P>
<P>
In this case, he noted, a growing number of lawyers have been
wrongly charged with the crimes of covering up, obstruction of
justice, fraud for personal gain, and taking bribes.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the ACLA handled 97 cases of severe
violations of these kinds in the past four years, and only 27 have
been redressed.
</P>
<P>
"The professional and ethical quality of lawyers needs to be
enhanced," he stressed, noting that this is a by-product of the
rapid increase in the number of legal service professionals.
</P>
<P>
The ACLA is stepping up efforts to formulate new self-
regulatory rules for meting out penalties to lawyers for unethical
conduct, the congress was told.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer system was abolished during the Cultural Revolution
(1966-1976) in China, and was resumed 20 years ago. There are now
over 100,000 lawyers working in nearly 9,000 law firms across
China.
</P>
<P>
As the country is geared toward the market economy and the rule
of law, the legal profession has become very attractive to young
students.
</P>
<P>
Over 142,500 people took the national examination for a
lawyer's qualification certificate last year, and only about 13
percent qualified.

ISLAMABAD, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Shiite Muslims in a village
near Dera Ismail Khan in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province
(NWFP) Monday mourned the deaths of four community members who
were killed by unidentified gunmen Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Another person was seriously wounded in the attack by the
gunmen in the village of Fateh, 340 kilometers south of Peshawar,
capital of NWFP.

<P>
The mourners were angered by the killing and raised slogans
during the morning procession, but the situation was immediately
brought under control, Deputy Commissioner of the Dera Ismail Khan
district Tariq Jameel said.
</P>
<P>
Police and officials from the Dera Ismail Khan district
administration said the incident was sectarian-related.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred after midnight. "We have reports of four
dead and one seriously wounded," police officials told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The deceased had apparently returned after attending a Shiite
mourning ritual and were sleeping in an open courtyard when they
were fired at with automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
Two of them died on the spot, one succumbed to wounds on the
way to hospital while the fourth died later.
</P>
<P>
Jameel said police had recovered 38 empty cartridges of bullets
from the scene of the incident.
</P>

Police officials said six people have been picked up for
interrogation on suspicion. "The situation is now fully under
control," they said.

<P>
It is less than one year since Yunnan opened its infoport, or
the provincial public information network. But it is now capable
of receiving some 10,000 visits every day. In addition, people
have opened "Internet Bars" or "Computer Houses" to serve Internet
or computer fans in the provincial capital of Kunming.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Kunming announced the opening of two new
websites relating to the forthcoming Exposition. The first is for
local citizens to monitor the daily operation of a dozen city
government departments and the latter offers real-time information
about nearly 300 local hotels and guesthouses for tourists and
visitors to book for hotels during the six-month international
event.
</P>
<P>
Officials from telecom departments in Yunnan and Kunming have
expressed confidence that there will be no "traffic jam" on the
local information highway during the Exposition, which is expected
to attract some 10 million domestic and overseas tourists and
visitors.
</P>
<P>
"We have invested nearly 10 billion yuan (about 1.2 billion US
dollars) in telecom projects over the past three years, including
the laying of more than 20,000 kilometers of fiber optic cable,"
said an official.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, the telecom operators in Yunnan are
capable of providing services to more than three million
stationary phone users and some one million mobile phone users.
</P>
<P>
According to Guo, in the early days after website of the
Exposition opened, some Internet users complained about the low
speed in visiting sites and in downloading during peak hours.
However, he said, such complaints have disappeared since the new
fiber optic cable was laid and a high-performance server was
installed in late March.
</P>
<P>
"Now we are capable of receiving one million visits at a time,"
said Guo with a broad smile. "It's really kind of 'luxury' to us."

<P>
KUNMING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Faced with an influx of emails
and inquiries for more information, Guo Yongzhong, manager of a
special website for the upcoming '99 International Horticulture
Exposition, had a mixed feeling.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very glad to see our website so popular," said Guo. "But I
worry that we won't be able to cope with the bombardment of
letters and inquiries for acute shortage of competent personnel on
hand."
</P>
<P>
The '99 International Horticulture Exposition, the first of its
kind ever sponsored by China, is scheduled to open in Kunming,
capital of Southwest China's Yunnan Province, on May 1.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the exhibition opened a website on the Internet on
March 1 this year to supply background information about the
exposition and report on the preparation work. It is the first
time for China to turn to the Internet for publicizing a major
international event.
</P>
<P>
"We must follow the common international practice of spreading
information," said Guo, who is heading a 30-member team to operate
the website.
</P>
<P>
The website, www.expo99.net, received some 28,000 visits during
the 10-day trial operation. In the ensuing one month and more, the
website recorded another 45,000 visits worldwide and more than 1,
000 emails.
</P>
<P>
"The actual number of visits should have been much higher," Gu
said, "as we also allow people to visit the site directly through
our friendly links, such as the China Economic Infonet, Shanghai
Hotline and European Internet."
</P>
<P>
Located on a plateau in deepest China, Yunnan gives people the
impression that it is remote and secluded, with conservatism
prevailing. In recent years, however, especially since it was
chosen to be the host of the Exposition, the province has spared
no efforts to develop local telecommunications and information
industry, trying to remold its image as an open province.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Army, Police, Judiciary Urged To Transfer Enterprises to Localities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China, today urged the army,
the armed police, and the judiciary to thoroughly sever their
links with their enterprises as part of a national campaign
against corruption.
</P>
<P>
Hu, also a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee, said that smooth progress has been made by the army and
armed police divisions as well as judiciary departments in halting
their business activities and cutting off their ties with
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
However, there are concrete and complicated procedures that
must be followed through in order to completely transfer the
enterprises to the localities, he said, adding that in some
localities, this is very difficult to deal with.
</P>
<P>
He called on the army, the armed police and the judiciary
departments to pay special attention to possible incidents of
bribery, dereliction of duty, peculation of state assets, and
other offenses which may occur in the process of transferring the
enterprises to the localities.
</P>
<P>
He urged the army, the armed police and judiciary departments
to fully appreciate their cutting off links with their enterprises,
a move which has won strong support from the masses.
</P>
<P>
Hu spoke at a meeting attended by the leaders of the cities of
Beijing and Shanghai, and Hebei, Liaoning, Shanxi and five other
provinces, and leaders of the army, the armed police and judiciary
departments.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Israeli Entrepreneurs Ink 7 Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and Israeli entrepreneurs
inked seven trade and investment cooperation agreements involving
chemical industry, telecommunications, agriculture and medicine
here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agreements include several sales contracts that will enable
Israeli companies to sell telecommunications equipment to China.
Other agreements will lead to the establishment of joint ventures
with Israeli expertise and investments.
</P>
<P>
Scattering in Beijing, Shaanxi Province in northwest China,
Zhejiang Province in east China, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
in north China and Chongqing Municipality in southwest China,
those projects involve contract volumes ranging from millions of U.
S. dollars to tens of millions of U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman, who is now on a state visit to
China, witnessed the signing of the agreements. Chinese Minister
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) Shi Guangsheng
and President of the China Council for the Promotion of
International Trade (CCPIT) Yu Xiaosong were also present.
</P>
<P>
Since China established diplomatic relations with Israel in
1992, trade and investments between the two countries have seen
quite rapid progress. The two sides signed several official
agreements on trade, investment protection and taxes.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade volume hit 523 million U.S. dollars in 1998, up
46.9 percent from a year ago. Israeli exports to China reached 170
million U.S. dollars, up 71.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the visit of Israeli president to China will
further boost the confidence of entrepreneurs of the two countries,
and help promote the mutually-benefiting cooperation in technology
and investment," said Shi Guangsheng, the trade minister, in a
speech before the signing of the agreements.

<P>
SHANGHAI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE)
aims to create a highly transparent, open, secure, and efficient
exchange in the long run, and become one of the major stock
markets in the Asia-Pacific region in three to five years.
</P>
<P>
The SSE's general manager Tu Guangshao told the sixth member
congress, which opened here today, that the SSE will strive to
grow into an important component of the world securities markets
in five to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The SSE will encourage the listing of hi-tech enterprises and
newly emerging industries; it will also support and standardize
the asset reorganization of listed companies, develop a bond
market, and further promote and improve the B-share market, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission Fan
Fuchun attended the two-day meeting, and spoke highly of the SSE's
great achievements, and urged the exchange to contribute more to
the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The SSE, one of China's two stock exchanges, was founded in
1991. By last month, it had had 486 listed companies with total
shares valued at 1.14 trillion yuan, accounting for 14 percent of
the country's GDP.

<HEADLINE> APEC Membership Helps Recover Russian Economy: Official </HEADLINE>

MOSCOW, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Trade Minister
Georgy Gabunia said here Monday that the Asia-Pacific region has
great economic potential and Russia's entry into the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) is helping the country tide over its
current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade
Minister Don Mackinnon, Gabunia said the primary purpose for
Russia to join APEC is to attract more foreign investment in the
country to stimulate its economic growth, particularly in Siberia
and the Far East.
</P>
<P>
Gabunia said Russia will take part in the informal APEC summit
in September.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which became an APEC member in 1998, registered 20.4
billion U.S. dollars' trade with other APEC members that year, of
which Russia's exports stood at 12.1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Besides Russia, APEC also groups Australia, Brunei, Canada,
Chile, China, Chinese Hong Kong, Chinese Taipei, Indonesia, Japan,
Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the

<HEADLINE> Private Companies Taking off Red Hat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- More and more private enterprises
in China no long feel the need to be called "collective
enterprises" -- the so-called "red hat", and are trying to take
off the "red hat."
</P>
<P>
Davin Mackenzie, chief of the Resident Mission of International
Finance Corporation in China, told the on-going World Economic
Forum here today that private sector is to become the leading
component in China's economy.
</P>
<P>
Since Chinese government has fully recognized the important
role of private sector in developing economy, many private
entrepreneurs are no longer registering their businesses as
collective enterprises, a term to make vague the actual ownership
of the enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the State Economic and Trade
Commission (SETC), private enterprises now accounts for 19.1
percent of the country's total industrial output and 37 percent of
retail of consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
However, Mackenzie pointed out that the major restriction for
the development of private enterprises is lack of efficient
funding channels.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yonghao, vice chairman of Chinese Industry and Commerce
Federation, said that many private enterprises have difficulties
in getting start funds from banks.
</P>
<P>
Fang Haixing, general manager of Group Coordination Committee
of China Construction Bank, said that China's banking sector lacks
a tier of institutions offering loans for projects on which
commercial banks do not want to take the risk.
</P>
<P>
Mackenzie said that the Chinese government has yet to ease
control on the equity market. For example, he said that it should
eliminate non-tradeability of legal-person shares of listed
companies so as to widen sources of capital for private
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is more important that Chinese private
enterprises should live up to international norms of operation so
as to win funding from the financial sector. He noted that many
Chinese private enterprises have the problems of over-
diversification, lack of transparency and insufficient legal
compliance.
</P>
<P>
However, things are steadily improving. Liu Yonghao, president
of the country's largest feeds company -- Hope Group, said that
his company has learned lessons from failure of other private
enterprises and stuck to the core business of feeds production in
the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we had 400 million to 500 million yuan of profits
and equity market proceeds combined. We feel a great pressure on
how to spend the money," he said.
</P>
<P>
At last, the company's board vetoed a plan of building an grand
office tower and put the money on construction of new feeds
factories, including a 40-million-yuan factory in Viet Nam.
</P>
<P>
Patrick McGovern, chairman of International Data Group (IDG) of
the United States, said that the company has given venture loans
to some 50 projects in China in the past few years. IDG is
planning to channel one billion U.S. dollars to additional 450 to
500 venture projects in the country in the next seven years, he
said.

SHANGHAI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE)
has witnessed a rapid growth over the past three years, and has
raised a total of 100 billion yuan (about 12 billion U.S. dollars)
of funds for listed Chinese enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to Tu Guangshao, general manager of the SSE, the
number of listed enterprises in Shanghai reached 477 by the end of
1998, and the total value of the listed stocks increased by 3.21
fold to top 1.006 trillion yuan, accounting for 14 percent of

</P>
<P>
Tu told SSE members here today that the number of traders who
have opened accounts on the exchange is approaching 20 million,
and that the total turnover of securities and bonds being traded
in Shanghai has reached 9.18 trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The trading volume for bonds in Shanghai now accounts for more
than 95 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Tu said the SSE has also increased cooperation and exchanges
with international financial institutions over the past years.

<HEADLINE> Hamas to Attend PLO Central Council Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) will be represented at the meeting of
the Central Council of the Palestinian Liberation Organization to
discuss the statehood issue.
</P>
<P>
Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin Monday announced in
Gaza that he will head a Hamas delegation to the meeting and spell
out Hamas' position on the formation of an independent Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
The Central Council meeting will be held in Gaza on Tuesday to
decide whether Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat should announce an
independent Palestinian state on May 4, when the five-year
transitional period of the Oslo Accords expires.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be attended by 124 Council members.
</P>
<P>
In the past several months, Arafat visited many countries to
seek for their support and advice on the statehood issue.
</P>
<P>
He repeatedly claimed that he has the right to declare an
independent Palestinian state on May 4 under the 1993 Oslo Accords.
</P>
<P>
But Israel opposes the idea, threatening to annex parts of the
West Bank now under its control.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned again on
Monday that if Arafat decides to declare the Palestinian statehood
at the meeting, he will totally cancel implementation of the Oslo
Accords.

<HEADLINE> China to Pursue Strict Enforcement on Public Bidding (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature plans to
formulate its first public-bidding law to outlawing unfair trade
and corruption in this sector.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Peiyan, minister in charge of the State Development
Planning Commission, presented a report on the draft law this
morning to the Standing Committee of the Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
"It's desperately urgent that we formulate a law governing
public bidding in order to improve investment efficiency and
safeguard the quality of construction projects for the state,"
Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
Since early 1980s, China has carried out a public bidding
system in the use of foreign funds, the importing of large-scale
machinery equipment, the distributing of huge construction
projects, and the allocating of export quotas among domestic
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
However, the country has yet to adopted a law standardizing
practices in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"Our experience proves that the public bidding system can boost
the reform of investment and finance, create a fair market
environment, and improve the quality of construction projects,"
Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
The draft law stipulates that contractors must secure the right
to build infrastructure projects, public facilities, and projects
financed by international or foreign funds through public bidding.
</P>
<P>
Two of the methods chosen for future practice will be open
bidding and invitation bidding, both of which are accepted
worldwide.

<P>
Appraisal committees, which should be comprised of veteran
technological and economic experts, will make final decisions on
public bidding, according to the draft law stipulations.
</P>
<P>
To strictly safeguard project quality, the draft law prohibits
illegal sub-contractors.
</P>
<P>
Before the economic reforms of the late 1970s, government
bodies allocated construction projects and official purchases in
accordance with previous plans rather than market needs.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, only 4.8 percent of all construction projects in the
country were allocated on the basis of public bidding. But this
percentage has now risen to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Contracts for machinery-equipment trade arrived at through open
bidding were valued at more than one billion U.S. dollars this
year in China, and government bodies now also purchase office
articles, vehicles, and services through public bidding.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China is pouring more funds into
infrastructure to stimulate sustained economic development.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that illegal activities in public
bidding for construction projects now account for over 40 percent
of all economic criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
For example, this sort of activity is thought to be responsible
for recent bridge collapses and sinking roads in Chongqing
Municipality, and Yunnan and Liaoning provinces.
</P>
<P>
None of these poor-quality projects were subject to public
bidding or strict supervision.

<HEADLINE> BOC Launches New Consumer Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China (BOC) announced
today that it plans to launch consumer credit in a number of new
areas including housing and motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the BOC said that these new credit lines will

consumer credit agreements in four residential housing development
zones, and that by the end of the year the outstanding amount of
individual housing loans is expected to reach 340 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The BOC has completed procedures governing durable goods
consumer credit and educational fee credit, which will be
introduced in major cities soon.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the BOC will give full play to the
important role of banking cards in its consumer credit business,

<HEADLINE> NPC Examines Draft Law on Donation (part one) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature is
working on a draft law on public-welfare donations to further
promote the sound development of public welfare system in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The ninth session of the Standing Committee of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC) of China began here today to
examine the draft law, which has been in the making for the past
three years.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chunsheng, deputy director of the Legislative Affairs
Commission under the NPC Standing Committee, told the meeting that
poor management of donations has made it imperative to adopt a law
on the matter.
</P>
<P>
There exist many problems that need to be tackled in the area
of public-welfare donation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The managing and supervising systems do not work as well as
expected. Some individuals and organizations are found to divert
and embezzle donations, or engaged in profit-making activities on
the pretext of donation.
</P>
<P>
To better protect the interests of donors' and beneficiaries,
the draft law stipulates that those who receive donations give
donors legally effective receipts, establish sound accounting
systems and publish balance sheets periodically.
</P>
<P>
Every year, those institutions that receive donations should
report their revenues and expenditures to the government
departments, which have the right to audit their balance sheets if
necessary.

<HEADLINE> NPC Examines Draft Law on Donation (part two) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under the draft law, donors have the right to inquire about the
usage and management of their donations, and to make advices and
suggestions.
</P>
<P>
In addition, public-welfare social groups and non-profit
organizations should make public information on donations as well
as their usage and management, and accept public supervisions.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are various donation-recepients, including
government departments, social organizations, various funds,
schools and hospitals, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
To end the chaotic state, the draft law provides that in
principle, only the public-welfare social organizations and non-
profit institutions should have direct access to donations.
</P>
<P>
But donors could also choose to donate toward other
organizations or individuals if they wish to, he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhang revealed that in the process of drafting, there were
disagreements over whether government departments should receive
donations.
</P>
<P>
After repeated deliberations, the draft concludes that only
under special situations, government departments at county level
or higher could receive donations.
</P>
<P>
However, all donations thus received must be passed on to
public-welfare groups or non-profit institutions, or distribute
directly to those who most need them.
</P>
<P>
Government departments must never become the donation
beneficiaries, the draft law stipulates.

<HEADLINE> China to Increase Export Tax-Refund Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- China expects to raise its
overall tax refunding rate by 2.56 percent this year, a senior
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Lou Jiwei, vice minister of finance, told the China Business
Summit hosted by the World Economic Forum that the tax refunding
rates will be increased for 20 commodity categories including
machinery, electrical appliances, electronic products, and
textiles.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration
of Taxation raised the export-tax refund rates for coal, iron and
steel, cement, ships, and textile products and textile machinery.
They also simplified the application procedure for tax refunds for
exporters with satisfactory tax records.
</P>
<P>
"The new refund hike will strongly boost China's exports, and
check the slowing export increase," Lou said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the official, China will adjust its
policy on machinery import-taxes, a move meant to encourage
machinery imports to help upgrade China's products and technology.
</P>
<P>
Similar steps were taken in 1998 when the Chinese government
exempted tariffs and import value-added tax by either domestic or
overseas-funded projects.
</P>
<P>
China will also reduce the number of commodities under the
administration of the import and export license system, and
approve more businesses in their request to conduct foreign trade.

TOKYO -- Hundreds of Japanese people from civic groups and

to protest against legislation of a set of bills aimed at
implementing the updated Japan-U.S. defense cooperation guidelines.

Social Democratic Party (SDP) leader Takako Doi and Japanese
Communist Party (JCP) chief Tetsuzo Fuwa pledged at a rally to
appeal for the rejection of the bills, drawing applause from the
crowd, Kyoto News said.

In the afternoon, representatives of about 10 groups,
including the Federation of Japanese Women's Organizations, called
for discarding the bills in a joint statement issued at a press
conference, saying the bills would lead to the overseas dispatch
of the self-defense forces.

<HEADLINE> Top Legislature Reviews Macao Garrison Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- China's highest legislative body
today began reviewing the draft law on garrisoning troops in the
Macao Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the draft, Fu Quanyou, a member of the Central
Military Commission (CMC) and Chief of the General Staff of the
Chinese Liberation Army, said that concerned departments of the
Chinese military extensively discussed the formulation of the
draft law, in accordance with the Chinese Constitution, the Basic
Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region, and the actual
conditions in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The draft law stipulates that the CMC controls the troops
garrisoning in Macao and decides the number of troops, in line
with the needs of defense, in the projected special administrative
region, Fu said.
</P>
<P>
The central government of China will cover all troop expenses
in Macao, in which there will be a rotation of officers and
soldiers stationed there for defense.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft, the troops in Macao will assume
responsibility for meeting any invasion and will protect the
region, taking regular defense duties, administering military
facilities and carrying out exchanges with foreign militaries.
</P>
<P>
When the NPC Standing Committee declares war, or the regional
government in Macao declares a state of emergency, the troops will
take responsibility for safeguarding the region according to the
Basic Law, the draft says.
</P>
<P>
The draft also stipulates the rights and immunities of the
officers and soldiers stationed in Macao.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Fu said that after China takes over sovereignty in
Macao from Portugal on December 20, the administrative authorities
and the regional troops will no longer belong to each other, and
should not meddle in each other's affairs.
</P>
<P>
If needed, the regional government may require military support
from the troops for social stability or disaster relief, the draft
said.
</P>
<P>
Military judicial organs will deal with cases concerning law
offenders within the troops. Any infringements by troops who are
off duty on local residents' property will be submitted to the
regional judicial authorities, the draft said.
</P>
<P>
China's Supreme People's Court is authorized to deal with civil
infringement cases involving on-duty military personnel in the
special administrative region.

<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- China is satisfied with relations
between its armed forces and the Turkish army, a senior military
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Fu Quanyou, a member of China's Central Military Commission and
chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army, made
the remark here today when meeting with Necati Ozgen, president of
the Turkish Armed Forces Military Academy.
</P>
<P>
The continual exchange of visits in recent years between
military leaders of the two countries have strengthened mutual
understanding and friendship, Fu said.
</P>
<P>
He also said he believes that with effort on the part of the
two armies, friendship and cooperation will progress steadily and
comprehensively.
</P>
<P>
Fu also thanked the Turkish government for its constant stand
of adhering to "one China" and briefed the visitors on China's
economic construction and military building.
</P>
<P>
Ozgen said Turkey pays great attention to developing a
comprehensive friendship and cooperation with China, and hopes for
further cooperation between their armed forces.
</P>
<P>
"My goals here are to increase understanding of China and the
Chinese army, and establish strong relations between the Turkish
Armed Forces Military Academy and China's University of National
Defense," he added.

<HEADLINE> Train Attack Kills 25 in Angola: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- At least 25 people including 10
policemen were killed in an attack on a train in western Angola,
Portugal's Renascenca Radio reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a report from Angolan capital Luanda as saying that
the attack taking place Sunday near Canjala, some 80 kms from the
western port city of Benguela also wounded many more.
</P>
<P>
The troops of the National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) were possibly responsible for the attack.
</P>
<P>
The radio said in another report that 11 people had died when a
convoy of lorries was ambushed, also near Benguela.
</P>
<P>
It did not say when the attack occurred and possibly the two
reports were referring to the same incident.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities were searching the area for more bodies and
possible survivors of the attack on the train carrying food
supplies, the second in two weeks, said the radio.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, 15 people died in the same place when civilian
vehicles were ambushed, it added.
</P>
<P>
Road and rail ambushes have become frequent since fighting
resumed between forces loyal to the government of President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos and UNITA rebels just before Christmas, Reuters
said Monday.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Continue to Fall in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The value of total retail sales
in Hong Kong in February 1999 was estimated at 14.1 billion HK
dollars (1.8 billion U.S. dollars), a decline of 4 percent
compared with February 1998.
</P>
<P>
After discounting the effect of price changes over the period,
there was a marginal increase of 0.2 percent in total retail sales
volume in February 1999 compared with a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
These are the provisional figures on retail sales released
Monday by the Census and Statistics Department of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that, affected by the timing of the Chinese
Lunar New Year, retail sales tend to show much volatility in the
first two months of the year.
</P>
<P>
As the Lunar New Year fell in mid-February this year, but in
late January last year, the year-on-year rate of change in retail
sales in February this year was affected by the low base of
comparison in February last year. So it is therefore more
appropriate to examine the retail sales figures for January and
February taken together.
</P>
<P>
Taking the first two months of 1999 together, total retail
sales declined by 14 percent in value or 11 percent in volume when
compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
A government Secretariat spokesman said the decline in the
volume of retail sales continued to moderate in recent months.
</P>
<P>
"This was probably due in part to a pick-up in inbound tourism.
Also of help was the local consumer sentiment, which seemed to
have turned better lately," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The improvement was more visible in sales of clothing and
footwear and of commodities at department stores, which showed
considerably lesser declines. Sales of food and drinks showed a
further increase.
</P>
<P>
But in general, he said, consumers were still cautious in
spending on durable and more expensive items, with sales of motor
vehicles, jewelry and watches, and other consumer durables
remaining on a distinct downtrend.

<P>
"The law will be of great significance for the development of
the non-state economic sector as the newly amended Constitution
has confirmed legal status on the private sector which is mainly
solely-funded," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yao Zhenyan added that the new law, if adopted, will become an
important part of the legal system of the country's socialist
market economy, which has been composed of company law and laws
concerning joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
China had 442,000 solely funded firms and 31.2 million self-
employed people registered at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The proposed draft law stipulates protection for the rights and
interests of solely funded firms and their investors, and gives
these firms the same market status as other types of enterprises
have had. Investors in these enterprises would have to shoulder
unlimited liabilities, and the law will also regulate registration,
management and liquidation of the sector in a bid to ensure its
healthy development.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Mourns TV Station Victims of NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people in Belgrade
on Monday paid their last respects to six victims killed last
Friday in NATO's bombing on the Radio and Television of Serbia (
RTS) building.
</P>
<P>
Members of the bereft families, friends, colleagues and
survivors with bandaged heads and hands gathered before six
coffins in front of the chapel of the Clinical Center of Serbia in
Delgradska, central Belgrade, braving rain that has been falling
all morning.
</P>
<P>
RTS General Director Dragoljub Milanovic said this period was
perhaps the most difficult in the history of the Serb people and
their country, and most certainly the hardest day in the history
of RTS and the Yugoslav media.
</P>
<P>
"Such a tragedy and crime have not, as far as we know, happened
to any other media company in the world. This is why our pain is
even greater. The enemy targeted all the 7,000 RTS employees,"
Milanovic said.
</P>
<P>
He promised that RTS would do everything to ensure that the
criminals, who have already admitted the crime, are brought before
justice and tried, Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
Lying in state in a white coffin was 28-year-old make-up artist
Jelica Munitlak, the youngest of the victims.
</P>
<P>
For her parents, Jelica's passing meant the going of the
family's only surviving child. Jelica's sister died seven years
ago of kidney disease, said Mira, 39, a friend.
</P>
<P>
The other five victims, all male, were Milovan Jankovic, 59,
mechanic; Dragan Tasic, 31, technician; Dejan Markovic, 40,
security guard; Slobodan Jontic, 44, fitter; and Milan Joksimovic,
47, security guard.
</P>
<P>
Ten RTS employees remained missing and Yugoslav military and
Serbian police experts and civil defense teams are still clearing
the rubble, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 18 wounded RTS employees, four were still in hospital
but their condition was stable.
</P>
<P>
The killing of innocent civilians working with the RTS has
sparked worldwide condemnation.
</P>
<P>
At the Yugoslav Army Press Center, many foreign reporters put
their signatures on a letter of protest initiated by a veteran
Austrian correspondent.
</P>
<P>
"As a journalist, human being, foreigner in Yugoslavia and war
reporter for 15 years, I strongly protest against the unbelievable
step NATO took this (Friday) night by bombing the Radio and
Television of Serbia," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
"Coming from the so-called democratic West, I feel ashamed
about this cruel action standing for an attack against every
journalist in the world," it added.

<P>
MACAO, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Macao Posts and
Telecommunications Department (CTT) will issue a set of stamps on
April 28 which illustrates how the early Macao residents carried
water for daily use.
</P>
<P>
CTT Director Carlos Lopes told reporters at a press conference
Monday that the four stamps in the set have face values of 1
pataca, 1.5 patacas, 2 patacas and 2.5 patacas respectively. About
8 patacas equal one U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
For each stamp, 1.25 million pieces will be issued, the
director said, adding that the stamps will be the fifth set issued
by CTT this year.
</P>
<P>
Macao set up a running water supply system in the 1930s. Before
that, the major source of water for local residents came from
streams and wells. There were still more than 2,000 wells
scattering in Macao's residential areas some 40 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Makes Fresh Push in Y2K Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A high-level Singapore official
Monday urged organizations to explain clearly their contingency
plans and have a communication strategy for information
dissemination although public service systems will be Y2K ready in
two months.
</P>
<P>
David T. E. Lim, minister of state for defense and chairman of
the National Computer Board (NCB) told the Singapore National Y2k
Seminar held here Monday, "Although we are well prepared, and
confident that our systems will continue to work normally, it is
foolhardy to assume that nothing will go wrong."
</P>
<P>
Lim urged organizations to have good disclosure and
dissemination of information and explain clearly their contingency
plans to deal with any problems that may arise.
</P>
<P>
Lim said all key government systems and service providers will
be Y2K ready by June, adding that 90 percent of these systems have
already been converted and tested.
</P>
<P>
Citing a recent survey of 1,000 companies in the private
sector, Lim said 73 percent of small and medium enterprises (SMEs)
would be ready by the end of the year but 27 percent of SMEs have
no plans and three quarters of the non-prepared SMEs indicated
they would not be affected.
</P>
<P>
"For the small percentage that is still inadequately prepared,
may I take this opportunity to sound a final warning," he said,
adding, "Time is running out."
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that the NCB had taken steps to raise awareness and
 instill a sense of urgency by sending out direct mail to 100,000
Singapore companies last month as well as in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
Underlining that the Y2K problem is not a localized one and
many systems are connected to global networks, Lim said failures
elsewhere in the world, such as in their telecommunications
systems, seaports or airports can also affect Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the seminar, the Civil Aviation Authority of
Singapore (CAAS) said its systems are 90 percent ready and will
reach complete Y2K compliance by June.
</P>
<P>
Referring to measures contained in its contingency plan, CAAS
said it has backup plans to manually enter flight schedules, sort
baggage manually and use manual invoicing and payment.

BRUSSELS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Dutch riot police had fired and
injured 16 people and arrested some 80 soccer fans on Sunday in
central Rotterdam of the Netherlands, with one man in critical
condition, Dutch officials said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time Dutch police had fired live bullets at
soccer rioting fans, and police believed some rampaging hooligans
even fired back.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Feyenoord supporters dispersed from the
square in front of Rotterdam town hall to celebrate their team's
victory in the national league championship before some youths
began to throw stones and bottles.
</P>
<P>
Riot police fired warning shots into the air and then at the
crowd, injuring four people. Four police were also hurt, a
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's violence was a big hit to the country who will co-host
the 2000 European Championships with Belgium. Rotterdam is the

<HEADLINE> Iraq Needs Equipment to End Oil Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraq is in urgent need of
up-to-date equipment to tackle remains of oil industry and to put
an end to the environment pollution, an Iraqi oil official said
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency,
Director-General of Iraqi Northern Oil Refineries Company Ali
Hamid Mohammed held the U.N. Sanctions Committee responsible for
delaying the approval of contracts Iraq has signed with foreign
companies for a long time.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed said that his company signed contracts with foreign
companies under the fourth phase of the oil-for-food deal which
expired last November to buy equipment and materials used in
refining industrial water.
</P>
<P>
However, those equipment and materials have not reached Iraq
yet after the fifth phase of the program has been in force for
five months, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused U.S. and British representatives at the
Sanctions Committee of putting on hold contracts it concluded
with foreign companies under flimsy pretexts.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed said that because units of purifying industrial water
in his company were destroyed during the 1991 Gulf War, his
company is following different ways to get rid of remains of oil
industry even by digging canals toward nearby valleys.
</P>
<P>
He added that his company drops remains of more than 600 cubic
meters per hour without dealing with those remains and turning
them into oil products as the company did before the
U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq following its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Iraq needs 15 billion U.S. dollars to
restore its oil production to pre-sanctions level of 3.25 million
barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Iraq also plans to attract 15 billion dollars of investment to
develop new oil fields so that it can increase its oil production
to 6 million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
As part of the plan, Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rasheed
is visiting Moscow to discuss means of enhancing bilateral
cooperation in developing new oil fields in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Civic Groups Opposed to Defense Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Japanese people from
civic groups and labor unions gathered outside Japan's Diet (
parliament) on Monday to protest against legislation of a set of
bills aimed at implementing the updated Japan-U.S. defense
cooperation guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Social Democratic Party (SDP) leader Takako Doi and Japanese
Communist Party (JCP) chief Tetsuzo Fuwa pledged at a rally to
appeal for the rejection of the bills, drawing applause from the
crowd, Kyoto News said.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, representatives of about 10 groups, including
the Federation of Japanese Women's Organizations, called for
discarding the bills in a joint statement issued at a press
conference, saying the bills would lead to the overseas dispatch
of the self-defense forces.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), its
coalition partner Liberal Party (LP) and the opposition New
Komeito reached an agreement on amendments to the bills, ensuring
the passage of the bills through the House of Representatives, or
the lower house, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the new Japan-U.S. defense guidelines, updated in 1997,
Japan's self-defense forces will provide more logistic support to
U.S. forces in emergencies in unspecified "areas surrounding Japan.
"
</P>
<P>
People from Japan's various civic groups and labor unions have
expressed strong opposition to the guidelines on the ground that
they would draw Japan into war.

<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- China appreciates Israel's choice
of peaceful dialogue as a strategy for solving its disputes with
Arab nations, said Premier Zhu Rongji here today.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with Israeli President Ezer Weizman today, Zhu
urged an end to procrastinating over the disputes in the Middle
East as soon as possible, saying this is the hope of all peoples
in the region, and is in the long-term interests of all in the
Middle East, including Israel.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held this afternoon at the Diaoyutai State
Guest House. Zhu welcomed Weizman, who is visiting China for the
first time as president. He said close contact between leaders
will help deepen mutual understanding and friendship, and promote
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He praised Weizman for consistent efforts to develop relations
with China.
</P>
<P>
China and Israel both cherish long histories, and have enjoyed
successful cooperation in the fields of politics, economy, and
science and technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade has been developing fast in recent years, with
the trade volume in 1998 rising 46 percent over that of 1997, he
noted, adding that this shows strongly complementary economies and
extensive cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said he believed that with increased exchanges between the
two nations, Sino-Israeli friendship and cooperation will be more
fruitful in all areas.
</P>
<P>
China is ready to build and develop a long-term, stable
friendship, and cooperation for mutual benefit, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said Israel wants peace, though the road to peace will
not be smooth. He said peace will be eventually reached after many
difficulties are overcome.
</P>
<P>
Weizman arrived here Sunday afternoon for a seven-day state
visit to China at the invitation of Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, presidents of the two countries met to discuss
bilateral ties and other issues of common concern.
</P>

Weizman will also attend the opening ceremony of the '99 World
Horticulture Exposition in Kunming.

OTTAWA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy is off to Moscow and Macedonia this week to sound out
Russians on the developments in Yugoslavia, the Globe and Mail
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The minister's stop in Russia on Thursday will overlap with a
visit by United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan. The two are
expected to compare notes during a quick meeting in Moscow. Canada
holds a seat on the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Axworthy is to meet with Russian peace envoy Viktor
Chernomyrdin and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said Sunday that he was
unable to connect by phone with Chernomyrdin, as he said he would
last Friday, despite two days of trying. Chretien said he'll
probably reach the Russian envoy some time in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
But Canadian and NATO officials said earlier Canada does not
have a new peace plan or initiative it is taking to Russia on
behalf of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said Axworthy is one of many NATO
political leaders who will be in touch with the Russians in coming
days to encourage Moscow's efforts to persuade Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to accept NATO's terms.
</P>
<P>
After his Moscow stop, Axworthy will travel to Greece, a NATO
ally, and on to Macedonia on Saturday. He is expected to visit
refugee camps in the country and will wrap up his journey Sunday
by attending a land-mines conference in Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Legislative Council Discusses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Legislative Council
(PLC) has urged the Palestinian leadership to go forward to
establish an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its
capital.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by the PLC in a statement issued after its
meeting held in the West Bank city of Ramallah on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The PLC supports the establishment of an independent
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital and supports the
Palestinian leadership to begin with all the essential measures
and steps for that, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement called for putting an end to the five-year
interim period on May 4 this year according to signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
It also called for reinforcing Palestinian national unity
and the immediate start of a comprehensive national dialog
among all Palestinian political forces and factions to embody the
Palestinian state and to continue with confronting the Israeli
aggression against Palestinian land, human beings and rights.
</P>
<P>
It called on the Palestinian people to face Israel's
settlement activities, Israel's Judaization of Jerusalem and its
collective punishment against the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged the international community and
organizations to support the Palestinian people's right of
self-determination, to recognize the Palestinian state, to force
Israel to implement the signed agreements, to halt all of its
anti-peace activities and to release all Palestinian prisoners and
detainees from Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
During the Monday meeting, the PLC members expressed their
thanks to all the nations, particularly the Arab countries, which
have expressed their support for the Palestinian stand on
establishing an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
But the meeting expressed its regret to the U.S. position in
this regard, noting that the U.S. has neither practiced its active
role as a co-sponsor to the peace process, nor it banned Israel's
aggressive measures against the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is not in favor of establishing an independent
Palestinian state on May 4, urging Israels and Palestinians to
conclude their final-status talks within a year.
</P>
<P>
The Central Council of the Palestine Liberation Organization
is to start its meeting in Gaza on Tuesday to decide whether to
announce an independent Palestinian state on May 4.

<HEADLINE> Chronology of Recent Political Developments in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Indian caretaker cabinet Monday
decided to recommend to President Kocheril Raman Narayanan the
dissolution of the 12th Lok Sabha, the lower house of parliament,
in the wake of Congress' failure to form an alternative
government.
</P>
<P>
The current political crisis intensified on April 17 when the
government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost a
confidence vote in Lok Sabha after its main ally, All-India Anna
Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), withdrew support to it on
April 14.
</P>
<P>
The following are the recent political developments in India:
</P>
<P>
-- April 17: the BJP-led government resigned immediately after
losing the vote of confidence by 269 to 270 in Lok Sabha.
President Narayanan asked Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee to
continue as caretaker till alternative arrangements are made.
</P>
<P>
-- April 19: BJP told Narayanan to follow the same yardstick as
when Vajpayee was called to prove majority in Lok Sabha.
</P>
<P>
-- April 20: Congress President Sonia Gandhi began busy
consultations with leaders of the opposition camp on government
formation while Vajpayee hosted a dinner at which all BJP allies
reaffirmed support to his leadership.
</P>
<P>
-- April 21: Sonia Gandhi told the president that the Congress
will form a minority government with support of 272 MPs out of a
total of 543 and promised to produce letters of support within two
days. Home Affairs Minister of the BJP-led government submitted a
list of support of 270 MPs to the president.
</P>
<P>
-- April 22: Lok Sabha passed the general budget, the finance
bill for 1999-2000 and a railway budget. No visible results
emerged in the opposition camp concerning government formation.
</P>
<P>
-- April 23: Sonia Gandhi met the president again and claimed
the support of only 233 MPs but got more time to finish
consultations with "friendly parties."
</P>
<P>
-- April 24: AIADMK and Samajwadi (socialist) Party said a
"third front" government with Congress support from the outside
and with veteran Communist Jyoti Basu as prime minister would be
the only "viable option."
</P>
<P>
-- April 25: Sonia Gandhi told President Narayanan that she was
unable to form a government. At the same time, she ruled out
support for a "third front" government. Narayanan called in
Vajpayee for consultations immediately after meeting with Sonia
Gandhi.

<HEADLINE> Worst of Asian Economic Crisis Over: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Most senior executives of Asian
companies believe that the worst of the Asian economic crisis is
now over, showed a survey conducted by Dresdner RCM Global
Investors, the international asset management subsidiary of the
Dresdner Bank Group.
</P>
<P>
According to findings of the Asian Executives Survey published
here Monday, 60 percent of the respondents interviewed by Dresdner
RCM's Grassroots Research said the worst of the Asian crisis is
over for those companies that are willing to face change.
</P>
<P>
To determine the impact of the Asian economic crisis during the
past year, as well as the outlook for business growth, Grassroots
commissioned an interview with 58 executives in various industries
in South Korea, Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Japan, Singapore,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Some 46 percent of the executives interviewed said the recovery
is estimated to take place in at least one year and 17 percent of
them said the recovery will take place in six to 12 months while
19 percent predicted the economy to recover within 6 months.
</P>
<P>
South Korea and Thailand are expected to emerge first from the
crisis while Indonesia is most likely to be the last to recover
because the economic crisis there is coupled with a political
crisis.
</P>
<P>
As to which industries are most likely to emerge first from the
crisis, respondents cited technology, telecom, media and
communications. Heavy industry, finance and banking are likely to
emerge last.
</P>
<P>
Executives in Hong Kong said high technology is seen as an
economic savior by many Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Findings of the survey showed that most sources are more
optimistic about their business prospects than they were six-12
months ago.
</P>
<P>
Marc Friedman, director of Grassroots Research, said that last
April the corresponding Grassroots survey showed that companies in
the Asia-Pacific region were looking to consolidate their
operations, with most believing the worst of the crisis was yet to
come.
</P>
<P>
"Now we are seeing a much more positive outlook. Over 80
percent of respondents are more confident than they were six
months ago and businesses are increasingly looking to develop new
products and markets, restructure themselves and diversify to
improve their positions," said Friedman.

<HEADLINE> PNG Promises Swift Aid to Flood Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Papua New Guinean (PNG)
government promised Monday to move quickly to get food, water
tanks, medical supplies and tents for about 15,000 people facing
starvation after the worst floods in the country's Western
Province in 27 years.
</P>
<P>
Provincial Affairs Minister Dibara Yagabo and disaster
officials toured the inundated Lake Murray district between the
Fly and Strickland rivers Monday and met villagers whose homes and
food gardens have been destroyed by floods following months of
heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
Papua New Guinea's National Disaster and Emergency Services has
given the flood a rating of four on a scale of five, with four
indicating a critical shortage of food for people affected by the
disaster and five indicating no food.
</P>
<P>
"The immediate assistance they (the people) need now is to
resettle themselves to higher ground and then we can supply some
foodstuffs and rebuild the schools they have lost," Yagabo told
the Australian Associated Press Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The rivers won't go down the way the rain is falling... so
they might as well move out to higher ground."
</P>
<P>
The Fly and Strickland rivers, on the sides of Lake Murray,
broke their banks three weeks ago, flooding vast tracts of flat
grassland and jungle.
</P>
<P>
In many areas water is still rising and heavy rain continues to
fall.
</P>
<P>
Airfields, homes, schools and gardens with sago and banana
trees are all under up to four meters of water, according to
disaster officials.

<HEADLINE> China Values Ties with Sudan: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan said today that China values its friendship with Sudan,
and is willing to promote bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while holding talks this afternoon with
Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Ismail, who arrived here earlier
today.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two sides exchanged views on ways to
further Sino-Sudanese ties, and major international and regional
issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Tang noted the smooth development of bilateral ties since the
establishment of diplomatic relations four decades ago, and said
that this relationship has been promoted under the Five Principles
of Peaceful Co-existence.
</P>
<P>
There have been increased contacts between leaders of the two
countries and others at various levels, he said, adding that
mutually beneficial economic and trade cooperation has been
productive over the past years.
</P>
<P>
Tang also pointed to close bilateral coordination and sincere
cooperation in international affairs, and said the two countries
share wide-ranging consensus on many international issues.
</P>
<P>
Tang thanked the Sudanese government for its support of China's
peaceful reunification and China's opposition to interference in
its internal affairs under the pretext of human rights.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China is pleased to see the Sudanese
government's efforts toward realizing national reconciliation,
stabilizing the domestic situation, advancing the economy, and
improving relations with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
China supports Sudan's efforts to safeguard its sovereignty and
national economy, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Ismail thanked China for its invaluable assistance and support
for Sudan's independence, sovereignty, and economic growth. He
also spoke highly of China's independent foreign policy of peace
and its support for the just cause of the Arab and Palestinian
people as well as its contribution to peace, stability and
development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the international community, the Sudanese
government has made enormous efforts to realize national
reconciliation, develop its economy, and improve its environment,
the Sudanese foreign minister said, adding that Sudan will
continue its efforts in this regard.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> DPRK Condemns U.S. for Allowing Seoul to Test Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Monday condemned the United States for
allowing South Korea to test missiles with a range of less than
300 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
A DPRK foreign ministry spokesman also accused the U.S. of
applying double standard in dealing with the missile and nuclear
issues.
</P>
<P>
South Korea reportedly tested missiles with a range of under
300 kilometers on April 10.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that this is a gross violation of the "
memorandum of understanding on missiles" signed between the united
states and South Korea in 1979, which restricts the range of South
Korean-made missiles to 180 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the spokesman noted, the United States expressed
the stand that "research and development of missiles with a range
of less than 300 km could be allowed," after pretending to "
protest" it as a violation of the "memorandum."
</P>
<P>
This fact clearly shows that the U.S. is applying double
standard in handling the "missile issue" and the "nuclear issue,"
according to the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Membership Benefits Cambodia: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor
Nam Hong said here Monday that it will bring great benefits to
Cambodia to become a full member of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Hor Nam Hong told reporters after a National Assembly meeting
that it is Cambodia's long expectation to join the ASEAN regional
grouping.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure from a long-term point of view, joining the group
will bring political and economic benefits to Cambodia," he said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN has confirmed that a special ceremony to admit Cambodia
into the grouping will be held in Hanoi, Vietnam, on April 30. Hor
Nam Hong has been formally invited to attend the ceremony and will
leave here for Vietnam on April 29.
</P>
<P>
The date has been decided after consultation between Vietnam
and other ASEAN members. Vietnam will host the special admission
ceremony for Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cambodian opposition party leader Sam Rainsy said
Monday that he was against Cambodia joining ASEAN at this moment,
insisting that Cambodia has not yet met the conditions for entry
into the group.
</P>
<P>
He said joining ASEAN will hurt Cambodia's domestic market and
economy such as reducing the customs revenues and increasing the
burden on the limited national budget of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's entry into ASEAN will finally bring all 10 Southeast
Asian countries into the group. Its present members are Brunei,
Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Burma, the Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Wrap-Up: China-U.S. WTO Talks Conclude, China-EU Talks Begin (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and U.S. negotiators
concluded the latest round of talks on the remaining issues of
China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Monday
in a "useful" and "constructive" manner, while talks with the
European Union started on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Both China and the United States described the current round of
talks as "constructive" and "useful," according to Long Yongtu,
chief representative of negotiation of the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), although no concrete
progress was announced so far.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States conducted the current round of
talks last Thursday and Friday. Long and his U.S. counterpart
Robert Cassidy, who arrived here Wednesday evening just a few
hours after Premier Zhu Rongji's return from his two-week visit to
the United States and Canada, held a one-hour closed-door meeting
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides have discussed seriously the details of the
remaining issues of China's accession to the WTO, and have made
pragmatic and earnest efforts," Long told Xinhua following his
meeting with Cassidy.
</P>
<P>
Both sides said that the last-phase of a negotiation is often
most difficult, but they have "agreed to continue their efforts to
solve all the remaining issues so as to reach an agreement at an
earlier date," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The time for the next round of negotiations will be discussed
and announced by the two sides later, Long said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day technical talks to resolve the remaining issues
regarding China's entry into WTO ended without obvious results.
The talks were part of the efforts to carry out what Premier Zhu
Rongji and US President Bill Clinton had agreed on China's
accession into the WTO during Zhu's visit to the United States
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Topics for Sino-US negotiations covered the legal terms for
China's entry into WTO, tariffs on industrial goods and the
service sector, including finance, insurance and
telecommunications.

<P>
MACAO, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Macao Posts and
Telecommunications Department (CTT) will issue a set of stamps on
April 28 which illustrates how the early Macao residents carried
water for daily use.
</P>
<P>
CTT Director Carlos Lopes told reporters at a press conference
Monday that the four stamps in the set have face values of 1
pataca, 1.5 patacas, 2 patacas and 2.5 patacas respectively. About
8 patacas equal 1 U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
For each stamp, 1.25 million pieces will be issued, the
director said, adding that the stamps will be the fifth set issued
by CTT this year.
</P>
<P>
Macao set up a running water supply system in the 1930s. Before
that, the major source of water for local residents came from
streams and wells. There were still more than 2,000 wells
scattering in Macao's residential areas some 40 years ago.

<HEADLINE> China Reports Slow Spring Sowing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- China's spring sowing is now
going smoothly but slowly, said an official from the Ministry of
Agriculture today.
</P>
<P>
By April 15, the country had planted grain crops over 10.7
million hectares of land, accounting for 23 percent of the total
planned land for the entire spring sowing season. This figure is 2.
4 million hectares fewer than in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The official blamed drought and low temperatures for the slow
going.
</P>
<P>
Severe drought has affected several areas in northern China,
adversely impacting on more than five million hectares of farmland
mainly in the northwest, northern, and southwestern regions.
Shandong, Hebei, Gansu and Sichuan provinces have been the hardest
hit, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Though this has been the case, the official said that rain in
the past few days has eased the drought somewhat.
</P>
<P>
"Currently, what I'm worried about the most is the low
temperature, not the drought," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the chilly temperatures in the southern and
northeastern parts of the country at the end of March is harming
spring sowing at the time when seedlings needs warm days to grow
up.
</P>
<P>
In March, the average temperature in southern China during the
last ten days of the month was one or two degrees centigrade lower
than in the first twenty days. Early rice seedlings were rotting
in some parts of the region.
</P>
<P>
In the northeastern regions, where spring wheat is the major
crop, spring sowing was delayed by snow.
</P>
<P>
In Liaoning Province, for example, nearly 67,000 hectares of
spring wheat missed the best sowing period because of the weather.
</P>
<P>
The autumn grain output, which accounts for nearly 70 percent
of China's total for the entire year, comes mainly from the spring-
sown crops such as spring wheat, corn and soybean in the north,
and early rice in the south.

<HEADLINE> Scientists to Help Yunnan Find Gold Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at the Geology
Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences will help southwest
China's Yunnan Province complete a gold prospecting project by the
end of next year, which is expected to bring the province 30 to 50
tons of gold deposits.
</P>
<P>
"We will mainly focus on searching for new gold deposits in old
mines," said Cai Xinping, a researcher at the Geology Institute
who is responsible for the technical part of the project.
</P>
<P>
He said they will search deeper at the old mines, and will
employ new prospecting techniques which are totally different from
current methods.
</P>
<P>
In some foreign countries, the average gold-prospecting depth
reaches 1,000 meters, where large gold mines with deposits of more
than 30 tons each have been found, said Cai, adding that the
average gold prospecting depth in China is no more than 400 meters.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that more gold may be found deep under some large
and medium-size mines in Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
He said the scientists will use remote sensing and global
positioning systems for their prospecting, while also using some
geological and physical methods.
</P>
<P>
The project will provide the province with a data bank of the
distribution of local gold deposits as well as strategic plans for
the province's gold-mining program for a ten-year period.
</P>
<P>
The Geology Institute will also help choose some candidate
areas for prospecting in western and southeastern Yunnan.

despite picking up three red cards during the Gunners premiership
defense.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Seeks Closer Ties with Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 26 (Xinhua) -- South Korea hopes to reach
agreement with Russia on two major industrial cooperation projects
next month.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that we will be able to sign the agreements on the
construction of an industrial complex in Nahotka and natural gas
development in Irkutzk during my visit to Russia (next month),"
President Kim Dae-jung said when meeting with Russian State Duma
Chairman Gennady Seleznyov here Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Kim said the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) could participate in the gas development project and
other intercontinental cooperation programs if the situation on
the Korean Peninsula stabilizes.
</P>
<P>
The president suggested construction of a transcontinental
railroad network linking Europe and Asia and a gas pipeline
connecting South Korea and Russia, according to a presidential
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Kim expressed hopes that Russia will help Seoul reduce tension
on the Korean Peninsula through engagement with the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Describing Russia's role in establishing peace on the peninsula
as indispensable, Kim renewed his support for the proposed six-
nation talks on security on the Korean Peninsula, which would
involve South Korea, the DPRK, the United States, Russia, China
and Japan, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
In response, Seleznyov said Russia will be able to assist in
the unification of the two Koreas through the proposed six-party
talks and the most important thing in the unification process is
that unity should be achieved by peaceful means, not by war or
other conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov, who came here for a four-day visit Sunday, is the
first speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament to
visit Seoul since the two countries established diplomatic
relations.

<HEADLINE> India's Cabinet Recommends Dissolution of Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- India's caretaker cabinet
headed by Atal Behari Vajpayee Monday decided to recommend to
President K. R. Narayanan to dissolve the lower house of
parliament as no political party and its allies could be able to
provide a stable majority government.
</P>
<P>
"The cabinet decided to recommend to President K.R. Narayanan
that he may dissolve the 12th Lower House of Parliament so that a
fresh mandate is taken from the people as early as possible,"
caretaker Information and Broadcasting Minister Pramod Mahajan
said.
</P>
<P>
In deference to the president's assessment of the situation as
conveyed by him to the prime minister on Sunday, the cabinet
decided to recommend to him that he may dissolve the House,
Mahajan said, quoting a resolution from a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet had set no time-frame for fresh elections because
it was up to the Election Commission to conduct the polls,
Caretaker Commerce Minister Rama Krishna Hegde said.
</P>
<P>
However, under the Indian Constitution, there could not be a
gap of more than 180 days between two sittings of the House,
Mahajan said. The House last met on April 22 and the next lower
house of parliament must meet by October 21 at the latest.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission was left with the option of conducting
the polls in May-June or September-October, Mahajan said. But he
said it might be difficult to hold polls in September due to the
monsoon season and it was better to hold them in May-June.
</P>
<P>
The 13-month-old Vajpayee coalition government was voted out in
Parliament on April 17 by all opposition parties for its failure
to carry out correct policies.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Congress party, the biggest Opposition in
Parliament and the second biggest party in the country, has made
great efforts to muster enough support to form a minority
government with the support of all other opposition parties from
the outside as an alternative government.
</P>
<P>
But the Congress failed in its efforts, as some of the
opposition parties did not want to support a Congress-led
government. And President K. R. Narayanan was reported to have
turned down offers by both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP) to form a new government as none of them could muster
enough numbers of MPs for support.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with caretaker Prime Minister Vajpayee here
Sunday evening, Narayanan discussed the current political
situation with him and advised him to dissolve the parliament and
to have fresh elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mahajan said the Congress and Leftist parties had no
alternative but to dissolve the parliament for fresh elections.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister and Janata Dal leader H. D. Deve Gowda
said Monday that he welcomed the government's decision to
recommend dissolution of the parliament. "Now, the only thing is
to go before the people seeking their fresh mandate and there is
no other alternative," he said.
</P>
<P>
A full meeting of the Election Commission was held here Monday
to discuss its preparedness in conducting a mid-term poll in the
wake of the cabinet decision to recommend dissolution of the
parliament. M.S. Gill, the chief election commissioner who was on
a visit to the United States, cut short his overseas tour and
returned home.

transition program and liberal policies of the present military
government, the Post Express newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Barclays Bank, a British commercial bank, is the latest of
foreign banks to be setting up shops while the Stanbic Bank of
South Africa has already begun operation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, another British bank, the Standard Chartered
Bank, entered into the country's financial market.
</P>
<P>
Among the foreign banks showing interest in operating in the
most populous African country is the Mitsubishi Bank of Tokyo
which ranks as the second largest bank in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Barclays Bank and Standard Chartered Bank earlier had
businesses in Nigeria until they divested some two decades ago at
the heat of the indigenization program, giving way for what is
today known as Union Bank and First Bank respectively.
</P>
<P>
Banking sources attributed the renewed interest of foreign
banks to the successful transition program and the liberal
policies of the present military government in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The recent interest shown in Nigeria's financial market by
foreign banks is also attributed by industrial analysts to the
success story of Citibank of the United States which has been
operating in the west African country for barely two years but has
made tremendous progress.
</P>
<P>
Erastus Akingbola, Managing Director and Chief Executive
Officer of the Nigerian Intercontinental Merchant Bank, said that
the Nigerian financial market was large enough to accommodate many
more banks and any properly focused and efficiently run bank would
survive.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Thailand to Forge Closer Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Former Thai deputy prime
minister Amnuay Veerawan Monday suggested Malaysia and Thailand
focus cooperation efforts in the real sectors, especially
manufacturing, construction, energy, mining, trade and tourism.
</P>
<P>
And the two countries should also give incentives and financial
assistance to joint-venture efforts in these areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
He made the suggestion at the first MCOV Dialogue on Malaysia-
Thailand Business Partnership here.
</P>
<P>
"We should also consider pooling our resources strategically in
the area of our expertise to become stronger in the international
market, perhaps in food processing, consumer durables and
electronics," Amnuay said.
</P>
<P>
He said human resource development - education, training and
research - too played an important role, as only in this area can
"we overcome indifferences and really learn to appreciate each
other's culture, paving the way to genuine cooperation and
partnership."
</P>
<P>
He said the stronger ties between Malaysian and Thailand,
especially in trade, can help to strengthen the ASEAN-Free Trade
Area (AFTA) once it is implemented in 2003.
</P>
<P>
It is also important for both countries to draw on their
complementary and comparative advantages to enhance economic
growth and development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malaysian Industrial Development Authority (MIDA)
Chairman Zainal Abidin Sulong said there are many areas that both
countries can complement each others. Among them are the
automotive sector, food technology, processing of halal food,
support in gas as well as the development of Islamic banking.
</P>
<P>
"Once AFTA is being implemented, both countries must be in
place in terms of planning and strategies to take advantage of the
free trade. So, the urgency of such cooperation is more real than
what you may think," Zainal said, adding that it is crucial for
Thai and Malaysian companies to find a synergy to benefit from
each other's cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is Malaysia's second largest trading partner in ASEAN.
Total trade between the two countries grew to 17.897 billion
ringgit (4.709 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998 from 4.669 billion
ringgit (1.228 billion U.S. dollars) in 1990, according to
official figures.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Thailand's investment in Malaysia amounted to about
1.8774 billion ringgit (496.684 million U.S. dollars) while
Malaysia's investment in Thailand was 563.62 million ringgit
(148.321 million U.S. dollars).

</P>
<P>
There were 394 rises and 374 falls while 339 others remained
steady.
</P>
<P>
"Even though institutions might be at work and dealing, they
are not going to do a lot because the market is so thin today,"
Rob Black of Hartley Poynton said.
</P>
<P>
The All Industrials Index rose 9.2 points to 5,556.5.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Division of Provinces May Postpone Polls in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Officials of Indonesia's General
Election Commission (KPU) have said that the division of Maluku
and Irian Jaya into more provinces may postpone the general
election slated for June 7 this year.
</P>
<P>
It was decided Friday at a meeting of the Council for the
Promotion of Security and the Legal System that the division of
Maluku and Irian Jaya will be sanctioned before the election. The
meeting was presided by President B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent government decision, Irian Jaya will be
divided into the provinces of East, West and Central Irian Jaya,
while Maluku will be divided into North and South Maluku.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters here Monday, Bambang Sulistomo, KPU member
and chairman of the Indonesian Democratic Alliance Party (PADI),
said the sanctioning of the division before June 7 may result in
the postponement or cancellation of the general election.
</P>
<P>
"There are many agendas still facing the KPU in preparing for
the election. The addition of issues might thus foil the whole
work," said Sulistomo.
</P>
<P>
Syafruddinsyah Nasution of the Peace-Loving Party (PCD), also a
KPU member, said Monday the division of the two provinces before
the general election would oblige a revision of the commission's
agreement on the number of provincial representatives in the
People's Consultative Assembly, as well as the establishment of
provincial and district election organizing committees.
</P>
<P>
"The quite limited time available before the election makes it
impossible to carry out the division," he said.
</P>
<P>
KPU Chairman Rudini said on Saturday it was very likely that
the general election will be postponed.
</P>
<P>
He said it would be difficult to revise the legislative seat
allotment for Irian Jaya and Maluku, if taking into account the
government decision to split the two regions into more provinces.
</P>
<P>
The KPU had decided to allocate six seats for Maluku and 13
seats for Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
"Meeting the government's request would mean retracting the
decision the commission has already made on the allocation of
legislative seats for the two provinces and this will take time,"
Rudini said in Ujungpandang, capital of South Sulawesi province.
</P>
<P>
However, Ministry of Home Affairs Director General for Regional
Autonomy Ryaas Rasyid insisted that the KPU review its earlier
decision.
</P>
<P>
"KPU must discuss the new development in its plenary session,"
The Jakarta Post Monday quoted Ryaas as saying.

LONDON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary George
Robertson on Monday ruled out a "wholesale invasion" of Kosovo but
said NATO was re-examining how ground troops could be used once
the bombing of Yugoslavia ends.
</P>
<P>
"There is no intention to mount a wholesale, organized, opposed
invasion of Kosovo," Robertson was quoted as saying by a Reuters

ground deployment in the light of changing circumstances in the
region."
</P>
<P>
Robertson, who returned from a summit in Washington marking
NATO's 50th anniversary, said that the alliance's 19 members were
"speaking with one clear and united voice.
</P>
<P>
Giving the latest update on the 10,500 sorties NATO warplanes
have flown since March 24, he said, "(Yugoslav President Slobodan)
Milosevic's forces of oppression are being taken apart bit by bit,

HONG KONG, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang will visit Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland from
May 3 to 7, a government spokesman announced here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The visit, first of its kind by a senior Hong Kong government
official since Hong Kong's return to China on July 1, 1997, is
believed to aim to boost mutual understanding and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said these countries are important trading
partners of Hong Kong in Europe and they share many of Hong Kong's
views on international, financial, monetary and trade policies.
</P>
<P>
Noting a very strong information technology base that the
Scandinavian countries have developed over the years, the
spokesman said Stockholm and Helsinki, in particular, have
recently been classified among the top three information
technology cities in the world.
</P>
<P>
"It is important for Hong Kong to keep up with its profile in
the international scene and to explain to our trading partners how
we have successfully implemented the 'one country, two systems'
concept," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The financial Secretary will also be updating our partners on
the progress Hong Kong has made since the Asian financial crisis
and will explain the various reforms taking place to improve the
trading environment in the Hong Kong market," the spokesman added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The General Administration of the
Civil Aviation of China (CAAC) has completed preparations for the
safety inspection by the International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO) which is due in September this year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin made the disclosure this
afternoon at a meeting with Assad Kotaite, chairman of the ICAO
Council, at the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
As member of the ICAO council, China will cooperate actively
with the ICAO in its planning work of international air routes so
as to make greater contributions to international aviation, Jiang
promised.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed appreciation of the ICAO for its sustained
efforts in developing new aviation technology and enhancing
aviation safety to meet the requirements for air transportation in
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also extended warm welcome to Kotaite, who became ICAO
Chairman of Council in 1976, for his visit to China and praised
his contributions to the world's civil aviation sector ever since.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told Kotaite that China's civil aviation industry has
achieved remarkable progress since the country began reforms and
opening to the outside world 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Kotaite told Jiang that the ICAO and CAAC have enjoyed long-
term friendly cooperation, and expressed gratitude to the Chinese
government for its support to and help of the ICAO.
</P>
<P>
Kotaite said that as a founding member of the ICAO, China has
played an important role in ICAO development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's replying message to him on the ICAO is a "significant"
event in his half-century career in the civil aviation sector, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Kotaite arrived here over the weekend. This morning, he met
with CAAC Director Liu Jianfeng, and held working talks with CAAC
Deputy Director Shen Yuankang, respectively, to exchange views on
cooperation between the CAAC and ICAO.
</P>
<P>
The ICAO, founded in 1947, had 185 members by the end of 1997.
It is established with the aim of coordinating related economic
and legal affairs of various countries in the civil aviation
industry and establishing technical standards for international
civil aviation.

LAGOS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- American Olympician Mary Slaney was
found guilty of taking banned drugs before the 1996 Atlanta
Olympic Games, an IAAF official said on Monday in Monte Carlo,
Monaco.
</P>
<P>
Giorgio Reineri, spokesman for the International Amateur

clear evidence that an abnormal T-E test was attributable to
pathological or physiological conditions".

The IAAF gave Slaney a two-year ban, effective from June 17,
1996, the day after the test, Reineri said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Calls Economic Security Urgent Task </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 26 (Xinhua) -- As the trend of economic
globalization is accelerating, economic security has become an
urgent task for all countries in the world, particularly
developing countries, Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Wu Donghe
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the U.N. Economic and Social Commission
for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), Wu said economic globalization
has been gaining momentum rapidly, optimizing the allocation of
the factors of production throughout the world, promoting economic
exchanges and cooperation among nations and offering opportunities
and broad prospects for the economic development in all countries.
</P>
<P>
However, it also brings with it challenges and risks, which can
be seen from the financial crisis that broke out in Southeast Asia
in July 1997 and in other regions later, Wu told the 55th session
of the Ministerial Segment of the ESCAP, which opened here Monday.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that economic security constitutes the basis of the
prosperity and stability of nations and is an essential
prerequisite to world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
"Without economic security, it will be very hard to achieve
political stability and sustain culture and there will be no
guarantee for the overall security of a state," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official proposed to promote economic security by
strengthening cooperation in a mutually-complementary and
mutually-beneficial manner and by seeking common development.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that countries across the world respect
differences, treat each other as equals, coexist in peace and
harmony and establish a new international financial and economic
order through full consultations.
</P>
<P>
The 55th annual commission of the ESCAP was opened here last
Thursday with a Senior Officials' Meeting. The Ministerial Segment
is attended by more than 20 ministers from ESCAP members and will
end on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
They will focus their discussions on the theme of the ESCAP's
policy this year: "Asia and the Pacific Into the Twenty-First
Century: Information Technology, Globalization, Economic Security
and Development."

NEW DELHI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- India's caretaker Information
and Broadcasting Minister Pramod Mahajan said Monday that under
the constitution there could not be a gap of more than 180 days
between two sittings of the lower house of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The House last met on April 22 and the next lower house of
parliament must meet by October 21 this year at the latest.
</P>
<P>
It was not in the interest of the country for a caretaker
government to continue for six months and its term should be as
short as possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission is left with the option of conducting
the polls in May-June or September-October this year. But it might
be difficult to hold polls in September due to the monsoon and it
was better to hold them in May-June, he said.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Former Malaysian Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim Monday filed a notice of appeal
against his conviction and six years' jail sentence imposed by the
High Court here.
</P>
<P>
The notice was filed at the High Court Registrar's office by
one of his lawyers, S.N. Nair.
</P>
<P>
Nair told reporters that the defense would not file an appeal
for bail since it was too late.

<P>
He said that following the filing of the notice of appeal, the
court would provide the defense with the notes of evidence and the
defense would then have 10 days to file the petition of appeal.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was found guilty of four charges of corrupt practice with
interfering in police investigations into allegations of sexual
misconduct against him by the High Court, which sentenced him on
April 14 to six years' jail on each of the four charges and
ordered the sentence to run concurrently, commencing from that
day.
</P>
<P>
Nair confirmed that Anwar's five sodomy cases and one more
corruption case would be mentioned Tuesday at the High Court

WELLINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Minister of
Education Nick Smith Monday announced the Government's target of
having all schools on the Internet by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Every school pupil should have access to the information
superhighway," Smith said in a media release.
</P>
<P>
He said the power of the Internet grows by the day and
confidence in its use will be essential in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
"New Zealand's geographical isolation and large number of small
rural schools has previously been a barrier to accessing
information and knowledge. The Internet is an opportunity to
connect every school to the knowledge banks of the world," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very ambitious goal, but I believe it is
achievable," he added.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand has about 2,700 schools, of which 2,300 have
Internet access already.

<HEADLINE> Thai Deputy PM Urges Benefiting From Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister
Bhichai Rattakul Monday called on Asian and Pacific economies to
reap the benefits of globalization and liberalization.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary not only to minimize economic volatility and
to ensure a certain degree of economic security, but also to
enable us to reap the benefits of globalization and
liberalization," he told the opening of the Ministerial Segment of
the 55th Session of the United Nations Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).
</P>
<P>
In his message to the commission, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan highlighted the problem of globalization, saying "the
process of globalization and liberalization, while promoting
progress, has also served to accentuate differences within and
between countries."
</P>
<P>
According to Bhichai, the force of globalization has come to
dominate the closing years of this millennium.
</P>
<P>
"Few countries, if any, can isolate themselves from the effects
of world events and global trends, as witnessed by the current
financial crisis which has now spread to other regions of the
world," he said.
</P>
<P>
The application of information and communication technology
offers new opportunities to enhance the competitiveness and
effectiveness of various sectors of the economy, but it also means
some loss of national control over the economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must, therefore, adjust our policies and adapt ourselves to
the forceful process of globalization," the Thai deputy prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said that transparency, accountability, efficiency and
public participation -- the four major preconditions for good
governance -- have become the "watchwords" for political and
economic management of the next century.
</P>
<P>
Bhichai also said the lesson Thailand has learned from the
financial crisis will make the country stronger so it can move
towards sustained economic growth and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 47 members of ESCAP attended the Senior
Officials' Meeting of the 55th Commission, which opened last
Thursday. Over 20 ministers attended Monday's Ministerial Segment,
which will last until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will focus their discussions on the main theme
for this year's ESCAP policy: "Asia and the Pacific into the 21st
Century: Information, Globalization, Economic Security and
Development."

negotiation is often the most difficult period.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides agree they would continue their efforts to solve
all the remaining issues and reach an agreement at an earlier date,
" he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The time of the next round of negotiations will be discussed

</P>
<P>
The two-day technical talks between Chinese and U.S.
negotiators to resolve remaining issues regarding China's entry
into WTO ended without obvious results.
</P>
<P>
The talks were part of the efforts to carry out what Premier
Zhu Rongji and US President Bill Clinton had agreed on China's
accession into the WTO during Zhu's visit earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government voiced firm support for China's entry into
the WTO in 1999 during Zhu's visit to the United States earlier
this month, and great progress has been made for Sino-U.S.
negotiations on China's 13-year bid to join the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Topics for Sino-US negotiations covered the legal terms for
China's entry into WTO, tariffs on industrial goods and the
service sector, including finance, insurance and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, negotiations between China and the European Union
on China's entry into the WTO began Monday afternoon in two groups,
one on the tariffs on industrial and agricultural products and the
other on service trade. More than 10 people from EU participated
in the technical negotiations, which lasted two hours.

<HEADLINE> China to Speed Up Reform of State Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The key solution to China's
mounting unemployment pressure and sluggish domestic market lies
in accelerated reform of the state-owned sector, a leading Chinese
economist said here today.
</P>
<P>
Professor Wu Jinglian, a fellow researcher at the State Council
Development Research Center, made the remarks in a speech
delivered at the ongoing '99 China Business Summit.
</P>
<P>
According to him, efforts by the Chinese government to
encourage the development of medium-sized and small enterprises
since 1998 have provided a "safety valve" for the re-employment of
workers laid-off by large and medium-sized state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
While freeing medium-sized and small enterprises to the market
force, Wu said, the government is carrying out a strategic
adjustment to the state-owned sector so that large and medium-
sized state enterprises can withdraw from most of the competitive
industries and maintain their dominance in only a few sectors that
are essential to the national economy.
</P>
<P>
He held that state-owned enterprises should be restructured
into listed companies with diversified forms of ownership.
</P>
<P>
By this, Wu said, China would be able to see improved
performance of its state-owned sector and an initial success in
economic structure adjustment in three to five years.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking on the occasion, David Mackenzie, chief of China
resident mission of the World Bank's International Finance
Corporation, said it was a "wise" decision on the part of the
Chinese government to press ahead with the state-sector reform
while the economy is still on the fast track with inflation kept
at a low level.
</P>
<P>
He, however, pointed out that the difficulties of the state-
owned sector were often exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Chinese government should further relax
its control over the financial sector and allow commercial banks
to decide which enterprises should go bankrupt and the securities
market to decide which enterprises should be listed.
</P>
<P>
Laurence Brahm, managing director of the NAGA Group Limited,
China, has a good impression of the role of China's small and
medium-sized enterprises. Such enterprises, most of them in the
non-state sector, now account for nearly one quarter of the
country's gross domestic product and close to one third of the
retail sales.
</P>
<P>
Non-state businesses now play an important part in coping with
unemployment in China, he said, citing statistics that in 1998 the
non-state sector created 5.6 million jobs, while the state-owned
sector laid off 3.9 million workers.
</P>
<P>
As part of its ambitious plan to revitalize the state-owned
sector, the Chinese government is striving to turn one third of
the loss-making state enterprises into profit makers this year.
</P>
<P>
China's state-owned enterprises as a whole have began to
generate profit this year. Statistics show that in the first two
months, large state-owned enterprises registered a total net
profit of 1.26 billion yuan, the first time in three years.
</P>
<P>
They witnessed a net loss of 630 million yuan one year earlier.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Economic and Trade Commission, net
losses of medium-sized state-owned enterprises fell to 2.08
billion yuan from 2.99 billion yuan in the first two months this
year.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (53) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Following is Part 53 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Can the Macao Special Administrative Region participate in
diplomatic negotiations on matters related to Macao?
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic negotiations are a form of consultations between
sovereign states on matters concerning common interests or issues
of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Only independent sovereign states can participate in such
negotiations. The Macao Special Administrative Region, not being a
sovereign state, naturally can not conduct diplomatic negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Even if the interests of the Macao Special Administrative
Region are directly involved in the negotiations, only the Chinese
Government which has the sovereignty over it can negotiate with
the relevant foreign counterpart on its behalf.
</P>
<P>
However, the policy of "one country, two systems" will be
implemented in the Macao Special Administrative Region and the
Macao Special Administrative Region will enjoy a high degree of
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
In view of this, Article 135 of the Basic Law provides that
representatives of the Government of the Macao Special
Administrative Region may, as members of delegations of the
Government of the People's Republic of China, participate in
negotiations at the diplomatic level directly affecting the Region
conducted by the Central People's Government.

<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Following is Part 54 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Can the Macao Special Administrative Region sign agreements
with foreign countries on its own?
</P>
<P>
As far as state sovereignty is concerned, the Macao Special
Administrative Region, which is a local administrative region of
China, can not maintain and develop diplomatic relations with
foreign countries or regions independently, including relations in
the political, military and other fields.
</P>
<P>
But that does not mean that the Macao Special Administrative
Region can not have any relations or contacts with foreign
countries or regions.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Macao enjoys economic, cultural and other relations
and contacts with foreign countries or regions at present and
these relations have contributed significantly to the economic and
cultural development of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, to maintain the long-term stability and prosperity
of Macao, Article 136 of the Basic Law clearly stipulates that the
Macao Special Administrative Region may, on its own, using the
name "Macao, China", maintain and develop relations and conclude
and implement agreements with foreign states and regions and
relevant international organizations in the appropriate fields,
including economic, trade, financial and monetary, shipping,
communication, tourism, cultural, science and technology and
sports fields.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: History of International Exposition (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The '99 International
Horticulture Exposition will open in Kunming, capital of southwest
China's Yunnan Province, on May 1. Following is some background
information about the exposition:
</P>
<P>
International Exposition is an international event of
comparatively significant influence. It is usually hosted by the
sponsoring government and arranged by relative departments
designated by the sponsoring country. The Exposition aims to
promote global exchanges and development in such areas as economy,
culture, science and technology. It is also an opportunity for
participants to promote themselves and show their achievements. An
International Exposition is, therefore, reputed as "Olympic Games"
in such areas as economy, culture, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The Exposition has a long history. A primitive version was
originated in the Middle Ages in Europe as a form of a regular
commercial gathering or a fair.
</P>
<P>
The first International Exposition in its real sense was held
in London in 1851. Queen Victoria, through diplomatic avenues,
pioneered a new tradition of inviting other countries to
participate in the exhibition. Ten countries accepted the
invitation. They gathered and showed to the world more than 1400
items of precious artifacts and popular products.
</P>
<P>
In 1928, representatives from 35 countries met in Paris and
signed a pact on how to control the frequency and to safeguard the
standards of exposition. They made some regulations on the conduct
of international exhibitions, such as the requirement of a main
theme for each exposition, and also that the duration of an
exposition should not exceed 6 months.
</P>
<P>
In 1939, an international organization, known as International
Bureau of Exposition (BIE) was formally set up with its
headquarters in Paris, France. It was put in charge of liaison and
management of international exposition. In 1993, China officially
became a member of this organization, which now has a total of 47
member countries.

<P>
International exposition is classified into two categories:
comprehensive and specialized. The horticultural exposition is a
specialized one. More than 40 international expositions of various
kinds have been held across the world over the past 150 years.
Countries that have hosted such expositions include Britain, the
United States, France, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany,
Canada, Japan, Australia, Spain, Italy and the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Two years after the first London International Exposition,
another one was held in New York of the United States. Twenty-
three countries contributed to the exposition, making a major
break-through in contents. They added a new section on agriculture
to the exposition. Since then, countries hosting the international
exposition have all made contributions to enriching the contents
of the exposition.
</P>
<P>
In 1889, the French government hosted an international
exposition in Paris to mark the centenary anniversary of the
French Revolution. A magnificent steel tower -- La Tour Eiffel was
erected at the exposition venue, and it has since become the
symbol of France and Paris.
</P>
<P>
The first international exposition after World War II was held
in Brussels, Belgium, in 1958, with "science, civilization and
humanity" as its theme. The design of the exhibition hall was
modeled on the atomic structure, signifying that mankind had
entered a new era of science development.
</P>
<P>
Japan became the first Asian country to host such an exposition
in 1970. The Osaka International Exposition displayed to the world
the stunning speed of economic growth Japan had achieved over the
preceding decades.
</P>
<P>
Japan and Canada were bidding for the first International
Exposition in the 21st century in 2005. Japan finally won the bid
in the summer of 1997 when all members of the BIE voted in favor
of Japan.

<HEADLINE> Australia Withdraws Japan Tariff Complaint: Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Australia had averted a
potential trade war with Japan by withdrawing an official
complaint about rice tariffs, Australian Deputy Prime Minister Tim
Fischer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Australia had withdrawn its formal complaint launched in March
to the World Trade Organization (WTO) about the 390 percent tariff
the Japanese had imposed on rice sold above Australia's quota,
Fischer said on Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio.
</P>
<P>
Under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, Japan was forced to
open a small segment of its previously closed rice market and
Australia grabbed a 42 million U.S. dollar a year slice of the
lucrative trade.
</P>
<P>
But a tariff of almost 3 U.S. dollars a kilogram, or 390
percent, has now been imposed on the remaining 92 percent of the
rice market.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who is also trade minister, said he intended to
resolve the issue as trade minister in the next Millennium Round
of trade negotiations.
</P>

"All in all we have made a correct decision to move the agenda
forward rather than have a complete stalemate which, yes, could
have meant a loss of our wheat and rice and other sales to Japan,"
he said.

"It was that serious. We've been managing this issue day in and
day out and they are the purchasers of our products and it has to
be worked through very carefully."

"It still remained absolutely the correct decision to lodge the
formal objection and now effectively transfer that objection to
the next stage of agricultural trade negotiations," the deputy
prime minister said.

<HEADLINE> Future S. African Cabinet Not Finalized: Mbeki </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 26 (Xinhua) -- South African
president-in-waiting Thabo Mbeki has denied speculation that he
had a secret deal with Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu
Buthelezi on deputy presidency.
</P>
<P>
A decision on the future cabinet had not been finalized, and
the decision on the cabinet would only be made after the ruling
African National Congress (ANC) had finalized its candidate list,
the Sowetan daily Monday quoted Mbeki as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was speculated that the deal between Mbeki and Buthelezi
would result in the opposition leader becoming deputy state
president after June 2 election.
</P>
<P>
The ANC, the biggest political party in South Africa, will
definitely remain its rule of the country after the election, the
second since apartheid was abolished in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, elected as ANC chairman last year, will presumably
become top leader of the country after the election.
</P>
<P>
The IFP, based in KwaZulu Natal Province, is the biggest black
opposition party in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi has been minister of the Home Affairs Department
since the first all-race elections in 1994, though he is an
opposition party leader.
</P>
<P>
He has been assigned to be acting president of the country for
at least nine times while both President Nelson Mandela and Deputy
President Mbeki were abroad.

<HEADLINE> Senior HK Official to Visit 4 Scandinavian Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang will visit Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland from
May 3 to 7, a government spokesman announced here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The visit, the first of its kind by a senior Hong Kong
government official since Hong Kong's return to China on July 1,
1997, is believed to aim to boost mutual understanding and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said these countries are important trading
partners of Hong Kong in Europe and they share many of Hong Kong's
views on international, financial, monetary and trade policies.
</P>
<P>
Noting a very strong information technology base that the
Scandinavian countries have developed over the years, the
spokesman said Stockholm and Helsinki, in particular, have
recently been classified among the top three information
technology cities in the world.
</P>
<P>
"It is important for Hong Kong to keep up with its profile in
the international scene and to explain to our trading partners how
we have successfully implemented the 'one country, two systems'
concept," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The financial Secretary will also be updating our partners on
the progress Hong Kong has made since the Asian financial crisis
and will explain the various reforms taking place to improve the
trading environment in the Hong Kong market," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The visit will take Tsang to Oslo, Copenhagen, Stockholm and
Helsinki where he will exchange views with the respective
countries' ministers in charge of finance and economic matters and
bank governors as well.

<HEADLINE> Manila Eyes Entry of More Independent Oil Importers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
considering ways to bring in more independent players into the
country's oil industry to ease the pressure of higher oil prices,
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zamora suggested to the Congress that it rethink a four percent
tariff differential charged on purchases of independent oil
companies under the oil deregulation law.
</P>
<P>
"If Congress doesn't rethink this, we will always be at the
mercy of the big oil companies," Zamora said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
He said that while major oil companies have increased the
prices of their products, some independent oil importers have not
done so.
</P>
<P>
Caltex Philippines, Pilipinas Shell and Petron have increased
the prices of their petroleum products by an average of 50
centavos (1.25 U.S. cents) per liter.
</P>
<P>
These companies did this in response to the price rise of crude
oil in the world oil market where the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) has a large share.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the smaller oil firms, which have not hiked their
prices, may have gotten their oil supply from non-OPEC sources.
</P>
<P>
"So that's what we've been looking at, to see whether we can
encourage fuel companies to get from non-OPEC sources," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said one way to encourage independent oil firms is to remove
the tariff differential on the importation of refined petroleum
products to level the playing field.

<HEADLINE> China, U.S. Resume WTO Talks -1st Add </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and U.S. chief
negotiators met here Monday afternoon for more talks on the
remaining issues concerning China's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO), hours after China started talks on the same
issue with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Long Yongtu, chief representative of negotiation of the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), met
his American counterpart Robert Cassidy at 3:45 p.m. Monday inside
the MOFTEC building.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team is composed of four people.
</P>
<P>
China and European Commission (EC) started talks on China's
entry into the WTO Monday afternoon in two groups, one on the
tariffs on industrial and agricultural products and the other on
service trade.
</P>
<P>
More than 10 people from EC participated in the two-group
technical negotiations, which started at 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Late last week, Chinese and U.S. negotiators conducted two-day
technical talks to resolve remaining issues regarding China's
entry into WTO without obvious results. The talks were part of the
efforts to carry out what Premier Zhu Rongji and US President Bill
Clinton had agreed on China's accession into the WTO during Zhu's
visit earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Topics for Sino-US negotiations covered the legal terms for
China's entry into WTO, tariffs on industrial goods and the
service sector, including finance, insurance and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Long said earlier Monday after meeting with Gerard Depayre,
deputy director-general of Directorate General 1 of European
Commission, that China is prepared to make the greatest efforts to
push forward negotiations with the European Union and will strive
to achieve important progress as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He said China attaches great importance to its negotiations with
European Union (EU) and other members of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"As for China's entry into WTO, we will strictly abide by the
fundamental principles of the WTO, namely, the Most Favored Nation
Treatment," Long said.
</P>
<P>
The European side has expressed "firm support" for China's
entry into WTO within the year 1999, according to Long.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua has learned that Long and Depayre reached agreement on
the procedure and contents of this round of negotiations in the
morning discussion. Depayre came to Long's office in the company
of Ambassador Endymion Wilkinson, head of the Delegation of the
European Commission of EU to China.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations are likely to last for one week, and will
focus on service trade and commodities trade, Xinhua has learned.
</P>
<P>
Depayre arrived here Sunday morning. It is still not clear how
long he will stay here.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Set New Deadline for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will send a letter to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Monday,
expressing his support for extending "accelerated" final status
talks to reach a deal within a year, local daily Haaretz reported.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said that the letter is due to arrive before
the 124-member Central Council of the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) meeting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The letter is aimed at persuading the Palestinians to postpone
their unilateral declaration of statehood scheduled for May 4.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the letter would oppose any unilateral declaration
of Palestinian statehood. The United States opposes the French
position that the U.S. should automatically recognize a
Palestinian state if final status talks do not succeed within a
year.
</P>
<P>
The letter, the first expression of the U.S. support for an
"accelerated" year of talks on the final status of Palestinian
statehood, was the subject of negotiations between the Clinton
administration and Palestinian top negotiators Mahmoud Abbas and
Saeb Erekat in Washington last week.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Clinton would repeat in the letter a
formulation similar to what he said during a speech to the
members of the Palestinian National Council in Gaza last December.
</P>
<P>
At the time, Clinton said "Israel must recognize the right of
the Palestinians to live freely today, tomorrow, and forever."
</P>
<P>
Such a formulation is considered less forceful than an
unequivocal expression of the U.S. support for Palestinian
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
The letter also would express opposition to unilateral Israeli
actions such as building and expanding settlements in occupied
Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
The letter is expected to express support for basing the
"accelerated" final status talks on resolutions 242 and 338 of the
United Nations Security Council, which call for the Israeli
withdrawal from occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
The letter is also expected to include Washington's insistence
that previously-signed agreements, such as the Wye River
Memorandum signed last October, be implemented.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the letter would include an upgrading of the
bilateral relation between the U.S. and the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Under the 1993 Oslo accord, the final status negotiations
between Israel and the PNA should be finished on May 4 this
year. But the talks between two sides have been stalled for most
of the time since the right-wing Israeli Likud government came to
power in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians claimed that they have the right to declare
the independent state after the deadline of the final status talks
expires in May.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
threatened to "take severe measures," including annexing parts of
the West Bank, if the Palestinians unilaterally declare
statehood.

<P>
PARIS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- French President Jacques Chirac opposed the United States
vision of the new strategic concept of NATO at the Washington
summit of the alliance which ended on Sunday. France regarded the
United Nations Security Council as an incarnation of the state of
international law, while Washington wants NATO to have the right
to act by itself. Chirac said an abandoning of the UN would mean
the acceptance of the law of the strongest.
</P>
<P>
-- While some people in Europe regard the intervention of NATO
in Kosovo as a plot by the United States to dominate Europe, the
Washington summit of NATO showed that the relations between the
two sides of the Atlantic is complicated and in a full evolution.
France said the summit has seen a real compromise between Europe
and the United States on the new strategic concept of NATO, which
reaffirms the link between the United Nations and NATO.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO, which gave the face of unity during the Washington
summit, is now entangled in a difficult debate on how to share the
costs of the war against Yugoslavia. The price of the war was not
mentioned at the summit, but it will be on top of the debate at
the U.S. Congress this week, when the Capitol Hill examines a
demand by Pentagon to approve an extra five billion U.S. dollar
budget.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States, which is expected to pay 67 percent of
the costs of the war in the Balkans, is reportedly spending one
billion U.S. dollars each month in the war, while France, the
second contributor to the war, is expected to spend one billion
francs (170 million U.S. dollars) every three months.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Health Sector Deteriorates in 10 years: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's health sector is in its
worst shape in 10 years with the infant mortality rate rising from
61 per thousand to 74 per thousand, a senior government medical
official said.
</P>
<P>
Julius Meme, Director of Medical Services of the Health
MInistry, told a national conference that the health sector had
been deteriorating in the past 10 years due to poverty, the
malpractice of private clinics and the spread of malaria and
HIV/Aids.
</P>
<P>
Monday's Daily Nation newspaper quoted Meme as saying that the
Kenyan government had no funds to offer attractive pay to public
medical personnel or even maintain the health facilities.
</P>
<P>
Most medical equipment and drugs which were stolen from the
government health institutions ended up at "private clinics which
do not observe any form of ethics," Meme said.
</P>
<P>
"About 48 percent of the health care delivery was done by
private institutions," he added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that most private clinics in Kenya were run by
businessmen guided by the desire to make profits rather than
render service to patients.
</P>
<P>
Meme also attributed the child mortality increase to malaria
and HIV/ Aids.
</P>
<P>
The latest health survey results show that the gains which
kenya made in the past are being reversed. Meme said that the
health ministry is hoping to organize a meeting to discuss how to
change the trend.

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Cut Coal Production by 250 Million Tons This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to expand coal
export while cutting coal production by 250 million tons to 1.1
billion tons this year in a bid to reduce the huge stockpiles and
achieve balance between coal supply and demand, an official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Baoming, director of the country's State
Administration of Coal Industry, China will close down a big
number of small coal mines and cut the production of some others,
while having large coal mines reduce coal stockpiles and produce
less.
</P>
<P>
Large state-owned coal mines, the backbone of the coal industry,
will produce according to market demand, adjust their product mix
and lower production cost, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of March this year, China had
shut down a total of 15,000 small coal mines, and cut coal output
and stockpiles by around 80 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The official said that accelerating and expanding coal export
is of great significance for the sustainable development of the
country's coal industry, which can help reduce coal stockpile and
achieve balance between coal supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the expansion of coal export will help the country's
coal sector open wider to the rest of the world, and turn from
being extensive to intensive in terms of management and operation.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's largest coal producer, turning out one
third of the world's total coal output. However, the country
exported only 32 million tons of coal in 1998, accounting for
merely six percent of the world's total coal trade.
</P>
<P>
The official said that China plans to export 38 million tons of
coal this year.

<HEADLINE> Market Financing Can Help Urban Infrastructure Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- China should fully leverage its
capital market to finance urban infrastructure construction,
according to experts participating in an international forum on
urban infrastructure financing which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the seminar agreed that, in addition to
government budgetary input, financing through the capital market
is quite necessary for China to accelerate its urban
infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 Chinese and overseas experts and scholars
attended the two-day conference, which is jointly sponsored by
China's State Development Bank, New York Life and J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Director of the investment department under China's State
Development and Planning Commission Dai Gongxing said that over
the past 20 years China has made great progress in urban
infrastructure construction, providing a solid foundation for the
sustained, rapid and healthy development of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, with rapid economic growth and urbanization,
China's existing urban infrastructure is far from meeting the
demand for economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the coming years China will speed up the
construction of water supply, road, public communications,
environment protection and other urban infrastructure, and it's
hard for the government to be the sole investment source for all
urban infrastructure construction projects.
</P>
<P>
"Capital market financing is a significant way for meeting
investment demand in urban infrastructure construction," he added.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Research Institute of the People's Bank of
China Xie Ping said that international experiences indicate that
the capital market should be an important source for financing
infrastructure projects. In this respect, China has much to do to
develop its capital market.
</P>
<P>
According to Xie, during China's Ninth Five-Year Plan period (
1996-2000), approximately 570 billion yuan will be needed for
building urban communications and environment facilities, and even
more will be needed for telecommunications, gas facilities and
other urban infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
General Manager of J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. Asia Pacific Bart J.
Broadman suggested that the Chinese government pay more attention
to the importance of urban engineering bond financing market,
which not only can offer investment opportunities for overseas
investors, but also can avoid over dependence on bank financing.
</P>
<P>
According to sources, the participants will have in-depth
discussions on such topics as investment system reform,
infrastructure bond issuance, investment banking and other sectors
related to urban infrastructure financing.

KUNMING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The first thing to meet your eyes
when you come to Kunming City, the site of the '99 Kunming World
Horticulture Exposition, is the image of the Yunnan Golden Monkey,
the mascot for this world exposition.
</P>
<P>
Dressed in yellow T-shirt and blue jumpsuit, the red-lipped
mascot with a black triangular stuck-up nose can be seen
everywhere in this spring city as the opening of the exposition is
drawing near. It is spray-painted on a charter plane shuttling
between Kunming and other cities hauling visitors, on posters
strung along the streets, on the windows of the city's public
transit buses, on newspapers and magazines, on T-shirts and even
on drinking water cups.
</P>
<P>
"Welcome to Kunming", a two-meter-high eye-blinking mascot made
of fiber-reinforced glass at the main entrance to the exposition
utters in both Chinese and English while waving a bouquet of
flowers.
</P>
<P>
By the entrance to all the main exhibition halls and gardens
are 15 man-size mascot welcoming visitors with open arms.
</P>
<P>
Volunteers dressed like the mascot are weaving along the
streets and lanes in the residential areas in suburban Kunming to
hand out pamphlets and monkey-like toys to let every citizen in
the city to know about the exposition.
</P>
<P>
The "Yunnan Golden Monkey" is an endangered species in the
world. Native to Yunnan, it is under the special state-class
protection in China, just like the rare "Giant Panda". It was
estimated that there are less than 1,000 such monkeys living in
the wild in the province.
</P>
<P>
The mascot is named 'Ling Ling'. The name mascot suggests the
nimbleness, smartness, liveliness and loveliness, said Ms Tang
Huaiyu, who gave the mascot the name. It also has the meaning of
luck and success, signifying that the world horticulture
exposition will be a complete success.
</P>
<P>
The real baby animal was found injured in a forest on a
highland in northwestern Yunnan on the eve of the opening of the
horticultural exposition, it was immediately rushed to a hospital
of the local zoo. The doctors naturally call it "Ling Ling". The
little thing has put on weight by more than 300 grams since it was
taken into the hospital.

<P>
Hailed as the last of this century, the grand international
horticultural exposition is scheduled to open on May 1 and will

<HEADLINE> China, EC Start Group Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The discussion was conducted in two groups, one on the tariffs
of industrial and agricultural products and the other on service
trade.
</P>
<P>
More than 10 people from EC participated in the two-group
technical negotiations, which started at 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Long Yongtu, chief representative of negotiation of the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), and
Gerard Depayre, deputy director-general of Directorate General 1
of EC, conducted one-hour small group and closed door session at
Long's office inside the MOFTEC building this morning.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have discussed and reached agreement on the
procedure and contents of this round of negotiations, Xinhua has
learned from a reliable source with MOFTEC.
</P>
<P>
This round of negotiation is expected to last for one week,
Xinhua learned.

carry out what Premier Zhu Rongji and US President Bill Clinton
had agreed on China's accession into the WTO during Zhu's U.S.
visit earlier this month.

<HEADLINE> New Edition of Book on Kenyan President Off Press </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A new edition of a book that
chronicles the achievements of Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has been completed and is set to launch here later this week.
</P>
<P>
Wachenda Kilaka, the author of "Moi Profile", said that the
publication of the book had already received the president's
assent, the Kenya Times newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper did not mention on what occasion Kilaka made the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
According to the author, the first edition of the book was
published in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Kilaka said that the book results from a thorough academic
research and differs from Andrew Morton's biography of "The
President", "The Making of An African Statesman", because of its
intense academic approach.
</P>
<P>
Apart from recording the life of President Moi since he entered
public limelight in 1955, "Moi Profile" also records his most
memorable speeches and quotations.
</P>
<P>
Kilaka said the conclusion drawn by the book is that President
Moi has met 745 accepted societal needs out of the possible 960
recognized by the law of universal constancy, and therefore is
millennium legacy.

<HEADLINE> S. African Firms Dominate Zambian Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Over 80 percent of the company
mergers, buy- outs and acquisitions effected in Zambia so far
involve South African registered companies or transnational
corporations operating in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Executive Director of the Zambia Competition Commission, George
Lipimile said here Sunday that South African firms and
transnational corporations based in that country have so far
dominated in their involvement in a wide spectrum of activities in
manufacturing, dairy, agriculture and service sectors in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
"Even some of the giant transnationals whose head offices are
in Europe or North America have their regional head offices in
South Africa responsible for the African market," Times of Zambia
newspaper Monday quoted Lipimile as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some companies from east Africa have started coming into Zambia
market but their presence is still insignificant compared to the
South African involvement.
</P>
<P>
The executive director said that the Zambian market has proved
to be ideal for most South Africa-based companies because of its
proximity to South Africa and has proved easier in terms of access
to both merchandise and communication.
</P>
<P>
Zambia also boasts of a comparatively cheaper but highly
skilled manpower base and offers a number of investment incentives
to those with excess to foreign capital, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Lipimile noted that in a liberalized market like that
of Zambia, what matters is the ability to play in the market.

<HEADLINE> E. African economies to Perform Better in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The economies of Kenya, Tanzania
and Uganda will be among the fastest growing in the world this
year and the next, according to a forecast of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The IMF forecast says that output in each East African country
is predicted to expand at a higher rate than that for the global
economy and for the developing world, the East African newspapers
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Growth in Kenya is expected to be 3.5 percent in 1999 and six
percent in 2000, compared with the projected global figures of 2.3
percent this year and 3.4 percent next year, the forecast says.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth in Tanzania and Uganda is expected on a faster
pace, the forecast says, noting that 1999's anticipated increases
for Tanzania and Uganda are put at 5.2 percent and seven percent
respectively, to be followed in 2000 by 5.9 percent for Tanzania
and seven percent for Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The three East African countries are also believed likely to
outperform sub-Saharan African region which is likely to enjoy
this year's increase to be 2.9 percent and 5.2 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The IMF notes that while limited access to international
capital markets has deprived most sub-Saharan African countries of
many of the benefits of international financial integration. it
has also shielded them during periods of financial turbulence.
</P>
<P>
It adds that "The direct financial effects of the recent Asian
crisis on most countries of sub-Saharan Africa have therefore been
relatively small."
</P>
<P>
Reform implemented by many African governments during the past
decade further contributes to the region's favorable outlook, the
IMF forecast says.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Develop New High-tech Solution to Landmine Menace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Two vastly different
technologies, metal detection and ground penetrating radar, will
be combined in Australia's latest effort to help clear
war-affected countries of landmines, Australian Associated Press
(AAP) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Australia's Defense Science and Technology Organization (DSTO)
and Minelab Electronics, a company in the southern Australian
city of Adelaide, have signed a research agreement to develop a
new high-tech method of detecting plastic mines, AAP said.
</P>
<P>
The mines, which are made entirely of plastic except for the
metal firing pin and detonator cap, are virtually undetectable
with existing technology.
</P>
<P>
Minelab has adapted its gold detection technology to make metal
detection equipment so sensitive it can locate mines containing
tiny amounts of metal even in heavily mineralized soil.
</P>
<P>
But Minelab managing director Ron Wickett said the metal
detection technology currently used in countries such as Cambodia
picked up nearly 1,000 pieces of harmless shrapnel for every one
landmine detected.
</P>
<P>
With the new technique, the ground penetrating radar would be
used first to provide a "signature" of the ground in which
anomalies could be identified.
</P>
<P>
The metal detectors would then be used to assess any objects
which looked like they could be landmines, thereby eliminating the
need to dig up every piece of metal.
</P>
<P>
"Future technology is to use probably a minimum of two types of
technology. The whole objective here is to try to speed up the
process of detection."
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement between DSTO and Minelab, researchers from
the two groups will use defense testing grounds to perfect the
dual technology.
</P>
<P>
Wickett said it would take about three years before the new
technique could be ready to be used widely.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Movies Lack Good Screenplays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A big problem for Chinese movies
is the lack of good screenplays, director Zhang Yimou told a group
of movie fans recently in a seminar held in Shanghai, Wen Hui
Daily said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that the successful production of a movie in China
requires three conditions, namely, a moving story, sufficient
investment and permission to release. But a good story is the most
decisive factor, Zhang noted.
</P>
<P>
The criteria for a good story, Zhang indicated, lie in the fact
that it must touch the heartstrings of most viewers.
</P>
<P>
Although a subscriber to almost all the national literary
periodicals, Zhang is still waiting for really moving stories.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yimou's "Red Sorghum" won a Golden Bear at the Berlin
Film Festival in 1988, while "Ju Dou" and "Raise the Red Lantern"
were nominated for American Oscars in 1991 and 1992 respectively.
He also won awards in the movie festivals held in Venice, New York
and Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Zhang has just decided to withdraw his two movies from Cannes
Film Festival as a protest to the "political and cultural bias" of
the jury of the festival.

</P>
<P>
"Oman's 2020 Economic Vision set an annual growth rate of 5.6
percent for the fisheries sector so that it could contribute 2
percent to gross domestic product growth," Omani Minister of
National Economy Ahmed Abdul Nabi Macki was quoted by the
paper as saying.

"The government is working to complete the infrastructure for
the fisheries sector by setting up jetties and providing security
by guarding the coast against abuse," he said.

Recognizing the challenges posed by economic globalization, the
minister stressed the need to rearrange Oman's economy and
continue the process of diversification.
</P>
<P>

the government was working to efficiently utilize for economic
diversification.
</P>
<P>
With its strategic location and long coastline, Oman is
considered a gateway to the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
"Work is underway to develop Salalah container terminal and a
free trade zone, the Sohar port and other ports leading to the
Red Sea, the Indian Ocean and East Africa," Macki said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Parents in Shaanxi Fined for Creating Dropouts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Nine farmers in Huangniupu Town of
northwest China's Shaanxi Province were sentenced to a fine of 50
yuan each for preventing their children from school at a court
hearing held here recently.
</P>
<P>
According to court decision, the nine defendants failed to
perform their legal obligations of guardians and accomplished the
fact of dropouts, thus violating the country's education law.
</P>
<P>
It was a shock to the nine accused and 500 people attending the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
"I never expected that I would be brought to court for stopping
my son going to school," said defendant Chen Weibing, a 47-year-
old farmer.
</P>
<P>
He pleaded guilty and sent his son back to school on the same
day the court judgment was announced. Eight other defendants
followed suit.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey on compulsory education found 29 dropouts at
junior middle schools in Huangniupu Town. Government and school
officials of the town urged parents of these dropouts to let their
children go back to school immediately.
</P>
<P>
Some received the government' advice. But Chen and eight other
parents refused to do so on an excuse of lacking laborer and being
unable to afford school expenses. Under such consequence, the
government of Huangniupu Town filed charges in court.

Weizman said that the two countries have conducted fruitful
cooperation in many fields, and he expressed the belief that
cooperation has great potential and will expand to more sectors.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his appreciation for Israeli government's
adherence to the one China policy, and for refusing to have any
official contacts with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Israeli side to stand on guard against the Dalai
Lama's act to split China.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said that he will continue his efforts to urge the
Israeli government to stick to the One China policy, and to
respect China's stance on the Tibet issue.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed President Jiang on the history and the latest
development of the Middle-East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China pays great attention to the Middle-East
peace process and the situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
The deadlock of the peace process has benefited neither the
Arabic side nor Israel, and it has adversely affected peace and
development in the world, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that historical experience has demonstrated that peace
talks rather than military confrontation is the only correct way
to solve problems.
</P>
<P>
China holds that the relevant UN resolutions and the principle
of "land for peace" serve as the basis for the Middle-East peace
talks, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the key to the breaking of the current deadlock
lies in the fact that all parties concerned should earnestly
implement the resolutions and understandings which have been
reached.
</P>
<P>
China will continue its efforts to push forward the Middle-East
peace process, he added.

<HEADLINE> Positive Manner in E. Timor Talks Essential: Australian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard Monday said Australia had to engage the Indonesian
government in a positive manner if progress was to be made in
securing peace in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the comments just before he was due to
fly from Australian air force base Richmond for a meeting in Bali
Tuesday with Indonesian President B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
Australia requested the meeting last week in response to
escalating violence in the troubled province.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to understand what Australia can achieve, also
to understand that East Timor is a part of Indonesia and it is
absolutely essential if progress is to be made that we engage the
Indonesian government in a very positive and constructive way,"
Howard said.
</P>
<P>
Howard said it was important that Australia did not start
setting conditions, the Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
"It is also important that we have a realistic sense of what
Australia can achieve. There are too many people to talk rather
carelessly about what Australia might do, not withstanding that in
international affairs, it's influence in the end that counts," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Howard said the government was seeking an orderly and peaceful
resolution of the differences in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"I hope to have the opportunity of talking about the commitment
we have to an orderly and peaceful resolution of the differences
in East Timor," the prime minister noted.
</P>
<P>
The Australian federal government has offered to provide
considerable logistical aid for a UN-sponsored ballot scheduled
for July on East Timorese autonomy, but is looking for firmer
details on how that ballot would be conducted.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday in Sydney, more than 2,000 people turned out at
the Remember East Timor peace rally, where rally organizer Phil
Glendenning said the participants wanted to remember the people of
East Timor and to send a message to the Australian government that
"it is not enough to go over (to Bali)".

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Snap Polls on Cards in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Snap polls are on the cards in
India as the Congress Party, the biggest opposition in Parliament,
has given up its efforts to form an alternative government after
failing to gain enough support from various opposition parties
which voted out the Vajpayee government on April 17.
</P>
<P>
The poll is expected to take place at the end of May or
September this year. President K. R. Narayanan was reported to
have advised care taker Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee to
send a cabinet recommendation for dissolution of the current 12th
Lower House of Parliament, followed by mid-term elections, when
he met him here Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
The Congress Party President Sonia Gandhi had met the president
earlier in the same evening with the message that her party did
not have the number of MPs to form the government and that her
party did not support any third or fourth front to form any
government. At the same time, Secretary General of the Communist
Party of India (Marxists) Harkishan Singh Surjeet had also told
the president that his party would not lead an alternative
government.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee was reportedly to have accepted the suggestion of the
president to dissolve the Parliament and he told the president
that his government would like early elections.
</P>
<P>
The former ruling coalition government was keen on holding
early elections since it would likely to cash in on the "sympathy"
for the premature demise of the 13-month-old Vajpayee government
and the disarray in the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Holding polls before the first week of June might become
necessary for the climatic factor. The Monsoon season sets in
around the first week of June and lasts till October this year,
rendering large parts of the country inaccessible. Given the
constitutional requirement that the next Lower House of Parliament
session must be held before October 22, holding of polls before
the beginning of the rainy season may become imperative. If the
Election Commission expresses its inability at such a short time,
the likelihood of elections in September cannot be ruled out,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
After her meeting with the president here Sunday evening, Sonia
Gandhi told newsmen, " I tried my best to convince each and every
party that voted against the BJP-led government to support us to
form a government. Unfortunately, i could not convince them."
According to highly placed sources here, the president refused to
accept a suggestion by Congress leaders that Sonia Gandhi be
invited to head a new government first, and then asked to prove
majority. Senior legal and constitutional experts are believed to
have advised him against inviting any formation that didn't have
the support of 272 members of MPs, a simple majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the president was reportedly against giving
Vajpayee a second chance. He was learnt to have told Vajpayee that
he was not convinced by the argument that a defeated government
should be invited again without adding sufficient numbers of MPs
to ensure stability. A wafer-thin majority was no guarantee that
the government would last.

KUALA LUMPUR, April 26 (Xinhua) -- For the first time in 12
months, Malaysia's manufacturing production index showed a
positive growth of 2.6 percent in February this year compared with
the same month in 1998, the National Economic Action Council (NEAC
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary figures released by the Economic Planning Unit in
the Prime Minister's Department also showed that the index rose by
9.6 percent when compared with the index in January 1999, the NEAC
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The increase reflects the growing confidence among
manufacturers in response to the improved demand, from both local
and foreign markets," it said.
</P>
<P>
The highest increase was recorded in the plastics sector which
saw a 92.8 percent growth, followed by wearing apparels which
rose by 25.9 percent while the footwear, crude oil refining,
rubber production, chemicals, drinks and timber products sectors
also saw major increases, the NEAC said.

MOSCOW, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov reiterated on Sunday that he will not run for the
presidency in 2000.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Moscow Sixth Television Station, he
expressed dissatisfaction at the remarks made recently by some
senior officials of the Presidential Administration that "Primakov
is not an ally of the Kremlin".
</P>
<P>
Now what Russia needs to do is to make every effort to hold the
society together and the above-mentioned remarks were aimed at
driving a wedge between the president and the government, noted
Primakov, who described such attempts as harmful and futile.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister also reaffirmed his opposition to the
impeachment against President Boris Yeltsin, noting that the
president should continue to fulfill his mandate until the end of
the legal term. Launching an impeachment process against the head
of state will be good for nothing but disrupting the social unity,
he said.

He pointed out that under the current situation, it is
impossible for Yuri Skuratov to go on serving as the federation's

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Urges EC to Extend GSP Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Federation of Bangladesh
Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FBCCI) has urged the European
Commission (EC) to extend the existing Generalized System of
Preference (GSP) facilities for some more years beyond 2005 to
help Bangladesh attain competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
FBCCI President Adbul Awal Mintoo made the call at a meeting
with EC officials in Brussels on Friday, saying that Bangladesh
needed this additional time to help raise its competitive skills
and reach the same level with its big competitors, The Daily Star
Business reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is due to lose the facility for its largest foreign
exchange-earner sector, the ready-made garment industry, in 2005
along with other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Mintoo, leading a 27-member FBCCI business delegation to the EC
headquarters, also sought the commission's technical assistance
for Bangladesh's capacity building to implement the World Trade
Organization agreement on intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
Emilliano Fossati, the commission's director, said Bangladesh
should avail of the facilities under GSP, the European Community
Investment Partner Program, and Asia Invest for its overall
development with a private sector-led open economy and good
governance.
</P>
<P>
The European market consumes nearly 50 percent of the country's
total exports of about 5 billion U.S. dollars a year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Neighboring Countries Suffer Economic Losses from NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, April 25 (Xinhua) -- NATO's month-long bombing of
Yugoslavia not only brought sufferings to the nation but also
caused heavy economic losses to the neighboring countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
According to the official statistics, the bombing has so far
cost Romania and Hungary a loss of 730 million and 100 million U.S.
dollars respectively. Meanwhile the flooding in of refugees has
also increased economic burdens to Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of traffic on the Danube River due to the air
raids has held up hundreds of cargo ships, creating heavy economic
losses to the countries along the river, such as Hungary, Romania
and Slovenia. In addition, the transportation pressure on railways
and roads has risen because of the river shipment suspension.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bombing has also forced many air companies to
cancel or detour their flights, which directly increased the cost.
</P>
<P>
Hungary's air services to southern Europe, the Middle East and
northern Africa have to be changed. The daily fee for the changed
flights has to rise by 30-40 percent. Bulgaria's air
transportation sector suffered a loss of 40,000 Germany marks (
about 22,400 U.S. dollars) in the first three days of airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
In foreign trade, the cooperation between Yugoslavia and
neighboring countries such as Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria, which
was resumed following an end of the sanctions against Yugoslavia
not long ago, almost totally stopped.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian economic experts said that on the basis of 1500-
million-dollar trade volume between Hungary and Yugoslavia last
year, the loss from the month-long stagnation of the bilateral
border trade would be 12 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The long-term impact is even worse. International investors
will lose their confidence and sense of security in the central
and eastern European region, which therefore may harm the efforts
of the countries in the region to reinvigorate their economies.

<HEADLINE> China to have Higher Demand for Automobiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- China's total demand for
automobiles in 1999 is projected at 1.7 million units, an annual
growth rate of 6.25 percent, according to the State Development
Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
A recent market forecast released by the commission indicates
the estimated number includes new demand for 1.35 million units
and 350,000 replacements for obsolete vehicles.
</P>
<P>
An analysis of statistics for the 1990s reveals every one
percent GDP growth increased the demand for automobiles by 1.15
percent. The new demand for 1.35 million units is based on
projected annual GDP growth of seven percent for this year.
</P>
<P>
The automobile growth rate this year is approaching the 1997
level following a sluggish growth in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The market forecast also notes the trends of the auto market,
including the increasing influence of individual purchases on the
overall market.
</P>
<P>
Individual consumers are expected to purchase 922,000
automobiles during 1999, up five percent on 1997. The former
figure accounts for 55.6 percent of total purchases.
</P>
<P>
Cars and compact vehicles with engines smaller than 1.0 liter
will be a major aspect in the growth momentum.
</P>
<P>
Price cuts are anticipated for various types of vehicle.
Lightweight vehicles will most likely witness the largest price
drops, with cars and compact vehicles ranking second.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that price cuts are unavoidable due to prominent
oversupply on the auto market.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Nepal Communist Leader Man Mohan Adhikari </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The death of Man Mohan Adhikari
is considered here a loss not only to his Communist Party of Nepal
(Unified Marxist-Leninist, CPN-UML) but to the country as well.
</P>
<P>
The 79-year-old leader was jailed many times for his activities
for democracy. He was a founder-member of the Communist Party of
Nepal founded in April 1949 and was elected general secretary in
January 1954 at the party's first national congress.
</P>
<P>
He was one of the chief founder leaders of the United Left
Front (ULF) comprising different communist parties and groups.
With the Nepali Congress, the ULF launched a people's movement in
the spring of 1990 which resulted in the abolition of the ban on
political parties and the restoration of multi-party parliamentary
system in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of the CPN-UML in January 1991 as a
result of the merger of the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist) and
the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist), Adhikari had been
its chairman.
</P>
<P>
He was appointed Nepal's first communist prime minister on
November 29, 1994, after his party became the single largest party
in the mid-term polls.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here described moderate Adhikari as a big asset to his
party. They said that as a respected figure in Nepal, the late
leader had a mass appeal. He was acceptable to all factions as
well as the Western countries.
</P>
<P>
As the CPN-UML is still reeling from the split in March 1998,
Adhikari's death is considered irrecoverable because he was the
party's prime ministerial candidate for the parliamentary election
on May 3 and May 17 and its biggest vote catcher.
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, it could lead to serious demoralization with
the CPN-UML," senior freelance journalist M.R. Josse said.
</P>
<P>
But on the other hand, he said, it could galvanize the party to
high-level performance and perhaps even help it win back a sizable
chunk of supporters from the Communist Party of Nepal
(Marxist-Leninist, CPN-ML) which broke away from the CPN-UML in
March 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Adhikari's absence will also be felt for long in the national
politics," the latest Spotlight magazine wrote. "Known for his
commitment toward people and democratic ideals, Adhikari had the
capacity to directly appeal to the people whatever the situation."

<HEADLINE> Asians May Have Originated in Africa: Chinese Scientists (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists recently
released a research finding indicating that modern Asians may have
originated in Africa based on the fact that no continuous evidence
indicates that modern man in Asia evolved from upright-walking
human beings (homoerectus).
</P>
<P>
The finding, based on research of genetics, indicates the
present-day Asian gene pool mainly comes from modern man with
African origins. The conclusion accords with the unitary African
origin theory that all genetic trees of different groups in the
world and modern man have originated in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The study was the first in the world to use genetics to prove
the link between Asians and Africans.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an exclusive Monday interview with Xinhua, Jiayou
Chu, director of the Institute of Medicine and Biology under the
Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (IMBCAMS), said that no
evidence was found to support the independent origin of Asian Man.
</P>
<P>
"Modern African Man might have entered the Asian Continent from
the south and thereafter spread to northern areas," according to
Chu, who also headed the research team.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists discovered that primitive elements of DNA
found in modern Asians are identical with elements found in
Africans. The team used micro satellite probes to study 28 groups
throughout China and genetic links for different national groups
on five continents.
</P>
<P>
"We ruled out that a mutation occurred in the process of the
independent evolution of Asians," according to one scientist.
</P>
<P>
The research findings also proves that a small number of
Africans arriving on the Chinese mainland moved to northern areas
because of the hurdle of the mighty Yangtze River. Therefore,
variations amongst northerners are much smaller than those amongst
southerners.

here Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Long Yongtu, Chinese chief negotiator of the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), and G. Depayre,
deputy director-general of Directorate General 1 of EC, started
negotiation at 10 a.m. at Long's office inside the MOFTEC building.
</P>
<P>
Contents of the talks are still not clear.

Late last week, Chinese and U.S. negotiators conducted two-day
technical talks to resolve remaining issues on China's entry into

<P>
There is a disconnection or "faultage" in fossils of
palaeanthropic Asian man who lived some 100,000 years ago. It is
highly possible that African Man entered Asia 100,000 years ago
and evolved into modern man, said the scientists, adding that they
need to find more evidence to prove whether or not human beings in
Asia of older ages also came from Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The study represents a major scientific achievement and an
important step toward deciphering the secret of the origin of
mankind," said Wang Qinnan, a research fellow with the Life
Science Department under the State Natural Sciences Fund Committee
of China.
</P>
<P>
Foreign scholars issued a report in 1987 advancing a theory
that all human beings originated in Africa and later migrated to
other corners of the globe.
</P>
<P>
The research finding of Chinese scientists was carried in the
Proceedings National Academy Science U.S.A. and was praised in the
British magazine "Nature" shortly after its release. The
international academic community believes that the achievement of
Chinese scientists have provided ample basis for the theory that
mankind originated in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The gene structure research of the Chinese national gene groups
conducted over the past five years has been part of a scientific
and technological research program receiving key support from the
Chinese Government. Fourteen authoritative geneticists from cities
throughout China, including Beijing, Shanghai and Kunming, have
participated in the research.
</P>
<P>
IMBCAMS Director Jiayou Chu said his team has initiated second-
phase research on the subject.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Carries Out Iodine Deficiency Control Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is carrying out iodine
deficiency control project (IDCP) as a crucial one in order to
nurture healthy citizens of high intellectual standard, giving
priority to quality control of iodized salt.
</P>
<P>
The quality control in factories is being conducted by the
state-run Myanmar Salt and Marine Chemical Enterprise, while that
in household, wholesale and retail distribution level undertaken
by the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony here Sunday marking Myanmar's National Iodization
Day, Minister of Health Major-General Ket Sein quoted state leader
Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt as stressing the need to educate the
country's people on the iodine deficiency disease and benefits of
consumption of iodized salt as well as adequate supply of the salt
on the market.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that U.N. agencies provided technology and
financial assistance to the country's IDCP, adding that the
project has made considerable progress.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that Myanmar will continue to participate in any
project of humanitarian interest of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Iodine deficiency case was first found before 1900 not only in
the country's northern hilly region but also in plain region such
as Ayeyawaddy River delta and coastal regions.
</P>
<P>
Although control plan of iodine deficiency was carried out in
some areas then, the effectiveness did not last long.
</P>
<P>
Later the country formed the Iodine Deficiency Disease Control
Central Committee with the minister of health as its chairman in
1994, laying down the strategy of universal salt iodization which
is cost- effective and useful for a long term.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar attended the International Nutrition Conference in
1992, pledging to eliminate iodine deficiency that mostly affects
the children's brain growth and intellectual development.

<HEADLINE> China Witnesses Falling First Quarter Pork Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Pork prices continued to drop in
the first quarter of the year due to oversupply on the domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
Purchasing prices for pigs dropped 30 percent to 5.22 yuan per
kilogram in 11 major pig-raising provinces, while average pork
prices plunged by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
As a result, meat producers, pig breeders and fodder suppliers
suffered considerable losses.
</P>
<P>
"Farmers will quit raising pigs if meat prices continue to drop,
and their withdrawal from the industry may trigger insufficient
meat supplies and unreasonable prices for food products,"
according to an official with the State Internal Trade
Administration (SITA).
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute falling prices to improvements in the daily
diet of urban and rural consumers and the resulting shift from
pork to eggs and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
As part of an effort to curb falling prices, SITA recently
announced it will tighten market controls on meat supply and
quality supervision in order to revitalize the initiative of
farmers to raise pigs.
</P>
<P>
Meat prices are expected to gradually climb in the second half
of April.

WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China took a sweet revenge to
beat the U.S. national women's soccer team 2-1 in a friendly game
warming up for this summer's World Cup Sunday in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Ouying blasted in a low shot in the third minute of
overtime to sail the winning.
</P>
<P>
The victory snapped a 50-game home winning streak kept by the U.
S.team and gave the U.S. a 1-2 record in one month against China.
The U.S. is now 8-3-1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The winner came on a counter attack when midfielder Bai Jie
played a long ball to Zhang, who had come on as a substitute in
the 82nd minute. Zhang wasted no time to unleash a low shot past U.
S. goalkeeper Briana Scurry.
</P>
<P>
China opened the scoring in the 14th minute when U.S. defender
Carla Overbeck made a mistake which brought the ball to Sun Wen on
the left flank.
</P>
<P>
Sun carried the ball into the box and hit a left-footed chip
over Scurry just under the bar.
</P>
<P>
Julie Foudy tied the mark when she got a pass from Cindy Parlow
and chipped a short shot over the head of Chinese goalie Gao Hong.

<HEADLINE> East China Creating Financial Security Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- All banks in east China are to
experiment with a financial security system during the second half
of this year.
</P>
<P>
It is a major move by the newly established Shanghai Branch of
the People's Bank of China, the nation's central bank, to turn the
area under its jurisdiction into a financially safe region within
three to five years.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the central government implemented a decision to
replace the 31 provincial bank branches under the central bank
with nine regional branches in order to tighten control over
finances.
</P>
<P>
The new Shanghai Branch administers financial affairs in
Shanghai, the country's largest industrial and commercial city,
and the provinces of Zhejiang and Fujian, two major economic
powerhouses.
</P>
<P>
Under the new security system, all financial institutions in
the area will not provide services to any business or individual
who have no credit, nor will they establish business ties with any
illegal financial organization.
</P>
<P>
Financial institutions in the region will list those
enterprises and individuals who do not honor their agreements, and
will coordinate in refusing services to them.
</P>
<P>
The finance sector will further improve internal management by
singling out those employees who repeatedly break trade
regulations and cause losses, and banning them from working in the
sector.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Communist Party Leader Passes Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Veteran communist leader of
Nepal and former prime minister Man Mohan Adhikari died here early
Monday morning after being in a state of coma for seven days. He
was 79.
</P>
<P>
He was survived by his wife, son and daughter.
</P>
<P>
Prakash Adhikari, son of the late chairman of the Communist
Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist, CPN-UML), told Xinhua
that conditions of his father including blood pressure and
temperature had been "absolutely normal" until one o'clock in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
But since then his conditions began to worsen very slowly, and
at 02:32 his cardiogram stopped, Prakash said.
</P>
<P>
Adhikari had been supported by the artificial respiration
system since last Monday when he fell ill all of a sudden. His son
said that when his father was sent to the hospital, he had no
pulse and no heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
But within one minute, his heart restarted with the help of
machine and he was sent to the intense care unit of the hospital,
the son said.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said that since last Thursday, there had been no
activity in Adhikari's brain and conditions of his kidneys were
deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
"Kidney was not the problem, the only problem was chest, his
lungs. Family doctor said his heart was good," Prakash said.
</P>
<P>
He said part of his father's lungs was filled with water, "a
disease from childhood" and "a problem for his whole life," which
made it difficult for him to breathe.
</P>
<P>
Adhikari was hospitalized in January this year due to an attack
of asthma.
</P>
<P>
Prakash, a professor of geology, said that his father's kidneys
deteriorated due to the use of medicine which is good for heart.
</P>
<P>
He said all his father's brain was not damaged because his
finger and toe moved and his moustache grew.
</P>
<P>
All the past seven days doctors had been trying to put oxygen
into his brain but failed, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Adhikari became Nepal's first communist prime minister after
his party emerged the single largest party in the mid-term polls
in November 1994.
</P>
<P>
He was his party's prime ministerial candidate for the
parliamentary election on May 3 and May 17.
</P>
<P>
He is the second candidate to die before the election. Nepali
Congress candidate Tanka Nath Kafle died of a heart attack on
April 8.

<HEADLINE> Italy Marks Liberation Day Under Shadow of Kosovo War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Italians celebrated the 54th
anniversary of the country's Liberation Day of the Second World
War on Sunday, as President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro called for an
early end to the "worrying war" in Kosovo amid massive
demonstrations staged in some big cities.
</P>
<P>
In his message marking the L Day of April 25, when 54 years ago
over 150 Italian northern cities were liberated from the German
domination, Scalfaro noted that the anniversary "finds Italy
committed with NATO member countries to a worrying war."
</P>
<P>
He said that "in the name of freedom, we repeat 'no' to
violence, intolerance and ethnic extermination, the most brutal
acts the world can know."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Italy's north city of Milan, an estimated 50,000
people marched and gathered in the central square of the city for
a rally sponsored by the regional association of the Second World
War partisans and the big three trade union confederations.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the day, demonstrators clashed with a cordon of
police deployed to cut off access to the U.S. consulate.
</P>
<P>
When the marchers arrived, those in the front ranks ran into
tear gas and began hurling bottles containing red paint which
shattered on the windows and facade of the building housing the U.
S. diplomatic representation.
</P>
<P>
As policemen in anti-riot gear advanced, the protesters stopped
throwing bottles, but a group of demonstrators set fire to an
American flag.
</P>
<P>
In Rome, thousands of people staged demonstration against
NATO's attack on Kosovo Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Cavaliers Knight out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Cleveland Cavaliers, in a
desperate fight for the final playoff spot in the Eastern
Conference, today lost their starting point guard Brevin Knight
for the remainder of the season with a broken left hand.
</P>
<P>
Knight suffered the injury in the third quarter of Friday's 79-
75 loss at Milwaukee. He underwent surgery today to repair a
fracture of the fourth metacarpal in his left hand at the
Cleveland Clinic.
</P>
<P>
The second-year pro from Stanford started all but one of the
39 games he appeared this season, averaging 9.6 points and a team-
high 7.7 assists. He is seventh in the league in assists and 18th
in steals at 1.79 per game.
</P>
<P>
Friday's loss dropped the Cavaliers into 11th place in the
Eastern Conference, but they only are one game behind the Toronto
Raptors and New York Knicks, who are tied for eighth.
</P>
<P>
Starting forward Shawn Kemp is still receiving I.V.
antibiotics to treat an inflamed bursa in his right elbow. His
sprain of the left midfoot slightly improved and he no longer
needs the use of a walking boot. Friday's loss was the first game
Kemp missed and he will not practice Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kemp, who averages team highs of 20.5 points and 9.2 rebounds,
suffered the injury Wednesday against Miami and is still doubtful
for Monday's game against the Heat.
</P>
<P>
Also for the injury-plagued Cavalier, the bruised right knee
of guard Derek Anderson and the left knee tendinitis of forward
Corie Blount are alleviating.
</P>
<P>
Both are increasing their rehabilitation daily. Anderson is on
the injured list, while Blout could return after Monday.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A rural woman in Chengde, in
north China's Hebei Province, has looked after a wild white swan
for nearly 17 years.
</P>
<P>
Yang Xiuhua, who lives at Dayuxiang Village of Longtoushan
Township, Weichang County, happened to find that "something like a
small plane" flew two circles in the air, diving to stand at her
yard, one day in October 1982.
</P>
<P>
She built a special shelter for the swan and often fed it with
corn and vegetables. The swan was also shown how to eat grass on a
hill and catch fish in a river.
</P>
<P>
Yang and her husband, Lin Shuchun, raised geese to accompany
the swan.
</P>
<P>
Like Yang's baby, the white swan is familiar with her voice and
will come back home if Yang called her.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that her family will continue to raise the swan only
if "the little child" does not fly away.
</P>
<P>
A white swan can live as long as 30 years, experts note.

<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- China is building a 2,200-km
railway along its eastern coastline at a cost of approximately 30
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The railway will cross the six provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin,
Liaoning, Shandong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang, linking three major
economic regions: the northeast, the Bohai Rim and the Yangtze
River Delta.
</P>
<P>
The project, scheduled for completion around the year 2000,
will shorten the transport distance between northeast and east
China by 400 km to 1,400 km.
</P>
<P>
Part of the railway will be based on a number of existing lines,
including the Harbin-Dalian Railway.
</P>
<P>
Experts admit, though that it will be difficult to construct
the 89-sea mile ferry connection between the ports of Dalian in
Liaoning and Yantai in Shandong, the link once built will cut the
original transport distance by 10 times and become the longest
train ferry in the country.
</P>
<P>
The six provinces, whose combined area accounts for 12 percent
of the country's total, are considered economic powerhouses. Some
six million tons of cargo from these provinces each year have
presently to be transported in a roundabout way.

<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Italian farm machinery
manufacturers are trying to take a greater share of the lucrative
Chinese market, according to an official from Italian Institute
for Foreign Trade.
</P>
<P>
"We will expand the range of promotional activities in China,
The training of Chinese technicians on specific Italian machines
will be specially emphasized," the official was quoted by today's
China daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official led a group of more than 20 Italian farm machinery
manufacturing companies to the Agro-Foodtech China'99, a four-day
international exhibition on agriculture, animal husbandry and food
processing technology that closed on April 23 in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Longyue, deputy director of the International Cooperation
Department of the Ministry of Agriculture, said that there is
great potential for cooperation between Chinese and Italian
businesses in the field of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"Italian farm machinery manufacturers, which are advanced in
technology and offer a wide variety of products, can meet the
demands of the Chinese market," Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
But mainly because of geographical distance between China and
Italy, the export volume of Italian farm machinery products to
China has stood at a low level, he noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Today's Shanghai Securities News
reported that stocks for five money-losing companies will be
subject to special treatment beginning on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The five listed companies, including China Textile Machinery,

, have either reported red ink figures for two consecutive years
or have per share net asset values below the face value of the
stock.
</P>
<P>
Per shares prices of the five companies will be allowed to rise
and fall within a range of five percent.
</P>
<P>
Baiyunshan's annual report was released on April 24 and showed
losses of 818 million yuan, the highest level for any listed
company. The company reported a per share loss of 2.19 yuan, with
total debt exceeding assets.
</P>
<P>
Zhengzhou Baiwen recorded 1998 losses of 502 million yuan, with

The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), the watchdog
for the nation's securities industry, initiated special treatment
last year in a bid to protect the interests of shareholders.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Air Conditioner Compressor Plant Opens in Xi'an </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A new air conditioner production
plant with an annual capacity of 150,000 eddy compressors recently
passed a national technological assessment and entered operations
in the Xi'an High and New Technology Development Zone.
</P>
<P>
The new facility was constructed by the Qing'an Group, a key
enterprises under the China National Aviation Industry Corporation.
</P>
<P>
"The plant was constructed and entered trial operations in only
15 months," according to one Qing'an official. He added the
plant's compressors will replace imported units.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese expert said noted that third generation eddy
compressors have been widely used in developing countries since
the 1980s. However, the new type product is still on a small scale
due to the sophisticated technology required to produce key parts.

<HEADLINE> More Austrians Join in Anti-NATO Rank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The number of Austrians against
Vienna's entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has
risen markedly since the US-led NATO launched air campaign against
Yugoslavia, showed the latest public opinion poll released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by the Ifat Public Opinion Institute upon
the request of Vienna Daily, revealed that more than two thirds of
Austrians opposed the country's entry into NATO. Of them, 45.7
percent called on Austria to stay out of the military alliance
permanently.
</P>
<P>
Last year, however, those who were strongly against Austria's
accession to NATO accounted for only 31.3 percent of the country's
population.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted last June also showed 17 percent of
Austrians favored the country's entry into NATO while the figure
slumped to 7.2 percent now.
</P>
<P>
The recent survey showed that the majority of Austrians voiced
opposition to the accession issue because they feared that once
joining NATO, Austrian youngsters would be forced to participate
in NATO military operations.

<HEADLINE> Silk Garment Manufacturers Turn to Domestic Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of China's
silk garment manufacturers are turning to the domestic market for
business opportunities and take advantage of the strong demand for
silk clothing.
</P>
<P>
Silk garment manufacture's attending the recent '99 Spring
Commodities Trade Fair in Tianjin, a major port city in north
China, achieved an unexpectedly high trade volume with numerous
orders placed by domestic buyers.
</P>
<P>
The daily retail value for silk garments was estimated at above
100,000 yuan. Some 30,000 people attended the fair on a daily
basis.
</P>
<P>
"The craze for silk garments is turning into real purchasing
power, and has created a vast potential market for silk clothing
enterprises," said Xu Ce, assistant marketing manager for the
Xidebao Group, one of the 10 largest Chinese silk garment
producers.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the company previously exported most of its
products, but added that the domestic market accounted for close
to 66 percent of total sales. Xidebao plans to open 100 wholesale
centers nationwide by the year of 2003, each with an annual sales
of hit one million yuan, according to Xu.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that China's output for crude silk
accounts for some 80 percent of the worldwide total. In addition,
China accounts for some 50 percent of the world's silk garment
production.
</P>
<P>
Lu Cansong, general manager of the China Silk City Exhibition
Center, said China hopes to become the world's largest consumer
for silk products. He added that the industry continues to
introduce new manufacturing technology.

<HEADLINE> Keegan Hit by England Sick-notes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- England manager Kevin Keegan faces
a selection crisis ahead of England's friendly with Hungary on
Wednesday, after suffering a rash of withdrawals from his already
depleted squad.
</P>
<P>
Tottenham captain Sol Campbell was the first to pull out on
Sunday - but he was soon joined on the non-appearance list by five
others, leaving Keegan with just 16 fit players.
</P>
<P>
Leeds' young center back Jonathan Woodgate was injured in the 1-
1 draw with Manchester United, whose strikers Andy Cole and Paul
Scholes were then also withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
And the defensive resources were stretched to the limit when it
was announced that Aston Villa captain Gareth Southgate and
Chelsea full-back Graeme Le Saux were also injured.
</P>
<P>
The Football Association had been criticized by a number of
leading Premiership managers for staging the match at a crucial
time in the season.
</P>
<P>
When Keegan selected his squad last week he came to a deal with
both Arsenal and Manchester United over which of their players he
called up.
</P>
<P>
But despite his forward-thinking, Keegan has still been
deprived of the players he needs to make the match a meaningful
exercise ahead of the crucial Euro 2000 qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
The absence of so many big players increases the chances of
uncapped hopefuls, like Sunderland's Kevin Philipps and Michael
Gray and Leicester's Emile Heskey, starting against Hungary.
</P>
<P>
Tottenham central defender Campbell had admitted he was not
comfortable at the prospect of making the trip to Budapest which
is 160 miles from the Serbian war-zone border.
</P>
<P>
The official reason behind Campbell's withdrawal is a hamstring
injury picked up in Saturday's 2-1 home defeat by West Ham.
</P>
<P>
But his manager George Graham has made it clear that he does
not agree with Keegan's decision only to give consideration to
Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
"I can see why the top clubs in the Premier League didn't want
their players picked for the Hungary game but they shouldn't be
the only clubs to be considered," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I want my players as fresh as possible for our last few games
of the season. We are facing all the top three teams as well as
Liverpool in the next few weeks and I want to complete a good
season by finishing as high as we can.
</P>
<P>
"But playing an unnecessary England friendly at this stage,
especially if there is any possible danger, doesn't help anybody,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Newcastle Set to Swoop for Dani </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League football
club Newcastle United manager Ruud Gullit has launched a 10
million pound bid for Real Mallorca striker Dani, who is also a
target for reigning Premiership champions Arsenal and Sheffield
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dani, who starred in Mallorca's Cup Winners Cup semi-final win
over Chelsea last Thursday, recently turned down a six million
move to Wednesday even though Mallorca had accepted the bid for
the former Real Madrid striker.
</P>
<P>
Real Mallorca president Guillermo Corbella told the News of the
World: "I received a fax from Newcastle two days ago outlining a
deal.
</P>
<P>
"It is worth 10m and that's a lot of money, especially for a
club like this."
</P>
<P>
Corbella added: "Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday also inquired
but the Newcastle contract is much more than they have offered."
</P>
<P>
Newcastle have had problems in attack this year, with injuries
to their skipper Alan Shearer so the acquisition of Dani would
certainly bolster their squad.

<HEADLINE> Former IOC President Killanin Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Former president of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) Lord Killanin died on Sunday
at the age of 84.
</P>
<P>
Local reports, quoting members of his family, said that
Killanin had died at his home in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Killanin, a former war correspondent and film producer, held
the position of IOC president from 1972 to 1980. He was elected
IOC president just days before the 1972 Munich Games were
shattered by an attack by Palestinian guerrillas which killed 11
Israeli competitors and officials.
</P>
<P>
He did not take up office until after the Games but was
involved in dealing with the tragedy as first vice-president.
</P>
<P>
Killanin was born in London on July 30, 1914, but represented
Ireland as a sporting official.
</P>
<P>
He was elected president of the Olympic Council of Ireland in
1950 and become a member of the IOC in 1952. He became a vice-
president in 1968 before taking on the top job four years later.
</P>
<P>
In 1976 African nations walked out of the Montreal Games in
protest against a New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa in
the same year.
</P>
<P>
Four years later then-U.S. President Jimmy Carter led a western
boycott of the Moscow Games in protest against the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In the two months before the Moscow Games Killanin visited both
President Leonid Brezhnev in Moscow and Carter in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Even before the boycotts of 1976 and 1980 Killanin was well
aware of the influence politics could have on the Games.
</P>
<P>
In January 1975 he wrote in a book on the Olympics: "The Games
have also attracted more and more political attention.
</P>
<P>
"The arenas and the village have become a platform for
expressions of those seeking new freedoms and self-determination
within our society.
</P>
<P>
"Coming from a country, part of which separated from the United
Kingdom in my own lifetime, this is something of which I have been
fully aware. Yet in spite of political differences, sport
frequently overrides political divides."
</P>
<P>
Just before the Moscow Games, the present IOC chief Juan
Antonio Samaranch was elected as president and Killanin was named
an honorary life president.
</P>
<P>
Before he went into sports politics Killanin worked as a
journalist for Britain's Daily Express and Daily Mail. He was a
war correspondent before serving in the British Army during World
War Two.
</P>
<P>
In 1952 he was associated with director John Ford, making "The
Quiet Man", and later produced a number of other films including "
The Playboy of the Western World" and "Gideon's Day".

<HEADLINE> Safe Sex Learning Enhanced Among Chinese Youth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Peer education of young people
about safer sex and measures to avoid sexually transmitted
diseases (STDs) and HIV/AIDS was proposed by medical scientists
attending a two-day symposium in Beijing, according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Symposium, on family planning and sex education, which
began last Friday in Beijing, attracted participants from the
Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, the Netherlands and Australia.
</P>
<P>
"Peer education proves to be an effective way of spreading
reproductive health information among young people," Lu Zizhi, a
professor from the Beijing University of Medical Sciences, was
quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Peer education programs were piloted last year at universities
in Beijing and Shanghai, covering more than 800 university
students, Lu added.
</P>
<P>
Twenty senior medical students are selected to receive training.
The students then gave lessens to freshmen and organized workshops
on how to use condoms and oral contraceptives to avoid unexpected
pregnancy, STDs and HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Surveys indicated people with proper sex education tend to
postpone their first sexual experience to a later age than others,
an Australian medical official said at the symposium.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was jointly organized by the Science Research
Institute under the State Family Planning Commission and the
Organon Company.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves New Program to Prevent Global Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) Sunday approved a new program to prevent future global
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and Italian Finance
Minister Carlo Ciampi announced at a press conference that the
agency's executive board had given final approval to creation of
new "contingent credit lines" to make available billions of
dollars of IMF loans to countries before a crisis strikes.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident this will be an important contribution for the
world to be better prepared for future crisis," Camdessus said.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said the Mexico peso crisis in 1994 and the Asian
financial crisis made the IMF search for ways to lessen the
disastrous impact of a sudden loss when financial crisis occurs.
</P>
<P>
The IMF hopes that by announcing the pre-approved credit, it
will boost the investors' confidence that a particular nation is
pursuing sound policies and has the foreign reserve resources to
support its currency against speculative attacks.
</P>
<P>
Ciampi, chairman of the IMF's policy-setting interim committee,
described the approval of the program as "a good start for the
spring meetings" of the 182-nation lending institution.
</P>
<P>
The spring meetings of the IMF and the World Bank are being
held in Washington when the global economic climate looks brighter
than before.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said Sunday that the 20-month global currency crisis
"seems to be" over by now.

<HEADLINE> NATO Warns Caucasian Nations to Avoid Kosovo-Like </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- NATO foreign ministers Sunday
warned three Caucasian nations not to let their political
conflicts deteriorate into Kosovo-like violence, which might incur
intervention from outside as in the case of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright hosted the meeting
for the presidents of the three Caucasian nations -- Eduard
Shevardnadze of Georgia, Robert Kocharyan of Armenia and Heydar
Aliyev of Azerbaijan -- to stress the need for intensified efforts
at regional integration and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from France, Britain, Germany, Turkey and
Norway were also present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the three presidents had met together on
the occasion of NATO's 50th anniversary summit. But they expressed
interest in holding another session at some later date.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze offered to host the groups in Tbilisi but no
formal decision was taken, according to U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
Georgia has been grappling with separatists in the Abkhazia
section of the country, while Armenia and Azerbaijan have been at
odds over the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, a region of
Azerbaijan populated mainly by Armenians.
</P>
<P>
Albright stressed that there can be no real stability and
economic progress when a nation suffers from violent conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The NATO foreign ministers thus set certain principles, which
they said the three Caucasian nations must accept. These
principles include respect for the territorial integrity of all
the nations in the region, a willingness to grant peoples' demands
for maximum autonomy, international security guarantees and the
right of displaced people to return to their homes.

<HEADLINE> NATO Summit Ends Amid Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from the 19-member
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Sunday concluded a three
day summit after discussions about Kosovo and the alliance's
strategy in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which opened in the Ronald Reagon International
Trade Center amid protests near the venue, ended after separate
NATO meetings with Yugoslavia neighboring states and with
partnership countries.
</P>
<P>
By mid-afternoon, the streets around the Reagon Center were
still blocked by the police and Washington was still like a "ghost
town" as there were few automobile vehicles or pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
Chanting anti-NATO slogans, dozens of protesters marched
through 15th Street, which is close to the summit venue, towards
the Lafayate Park behind the White House.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, more than 10,000 demonstrators protested against
NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia in the park. They demanded that NATO
start a peace negotiation process.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators held signs like "NATO = North Atlantic Terrorist
Organization," "NATO = North American Terrorist Organization" and
"NATO = Nazi America Terrorist Organization."
</P>
<P>
Several people held a coffin with signs reading: "NATO VAMPIRE,
1949-1999," and marched around the park.
</P>
<P>
After a special meeting on Kosovo before they began to
celebrate NATO's 50th anniversary Friday, NATO leaders vowed to
continue its military strikes in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The leaders Saturday approved a new strategic concept that
finally breaks the original "collective defense" doctrine and
assumes broader functions to take actions outside alliance
territory.
</P>
<P>
However, there were differences on the interpretation of the
new strategic concept.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac hailed it as a triumph for
France and said it meant "NATO cannot and will not be able to act
without the authorization of this international recognization,"
referring to the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
To allow NATO exceptions from U.N. jurisdiction would set a
dangerous precedent for states or organizations and could
ultimately lead to "the law of the strongest," he said.
</P>
<P>
But NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, asked whether the
alliance would need a Security Council resolution each time it
intervened outside its territory, said bluntly: "No."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said he was pleased the new
strategic concept endorsed specifically the NATO military campaign
against Yugoslavia over the Kosovo crisis, which did not have an
explicit U.N. mandate.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that NATO's new strategic concept will
endanger the United Nations Charter and other international laws.
