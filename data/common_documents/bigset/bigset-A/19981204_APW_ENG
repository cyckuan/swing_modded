Japan may inform death row inmates about time of execution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's justice minister said Friday he is
considering the possibility of notifying death row inmates of their
execution in advance and allowing them to say farewell to their
families.
	   In a sign of adding limited flexibility to the nation's
secretive criminal justice system, a Justice Ministry spokesman
quoted Shozaburo Nakamura, the minister, as saying it is necessary
to review various practices involving capital punishment.
	   Nakamura, however, said no immediate changes are planned, said
the spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity. Nakamura made
the remarks at a news conference, the spokesman said.
	   In November, the government made its first direct announcement
of the hanging of three inmates, a month after Nakamura ordered a
review of Japan's long-standing policy of withholding information
about capital punishment.
	   In the last 10 years, those on death have spent an average of
eight years and 11 months in prison before being hanged, the
ministry said.
	   It said the inmates are notified of the execution only hours in
advance, and are not allowed to contact their families, who learn
about it days later.
	   Last month, the U.N. Human Rights Committee urged Japan to cut
back on crimes punishable by the death penalty and improve
conditions for prisoners on death row.
	   The Japanese government defends the use of the death penalty on
grounds that public opinion supports it.
	   Most recently, three people were hanged last month while another
three were executed in June. In 1997, four people were put to
death, the Justice Ministry said.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The man police believe terrorized
Australia with a letter-bombing campaign against tax collectors and
human rights officials was detained Friday in a hospital in
Canberra.
	   Australian Federal Police launched a nationwide manhunt
Wednesday for 43-year-old Colin George Dunstan, a former Australian
Tax Office employee, after 22 parcel bombs were discovered at the
Canberra mail center, addressed mainly to tax office staff.
	   Five more potentially lethal bombs have been found in Sydney,
Melbourne and the Gold Coast.
	   Australian Broadcasting Corp. said Dunstan had apparently been
hiding out at a motel near Canberra, and came to the hospital on
his own, before police arrived there.
	   The hospital would only say Dunstan was in ``stable'' condition,
but would not comment further on whether he had any injuries or
illness.
	   Police spokesman Daryl Webb said police would soon be
interrogating Dunstan.
	   It is not yet clear how Dunstan came to be in the hospital or
how police learned of his whereabouts.
	   On Friday police found a 27th letter bomb in a Sydney post
office and a train was halted and evacuated for a search.
	   The bomb at the Darlinghurst post office in Sydney was detonated
safely by police shortly after it was discovered at 8:15 a.m. The
train, also in Sydney, continued its journey when no suspicious
package was found aboard.
	   Police, ambulance and fire crews were also called to the Penrith
branch of the Australian Taxation Office in western Sydney after
the discovery of another suspicious package that turned out to be
harmless.
	   Government and business offices as far apart as Melbourne, on
Australia's southeast coast and its northernmost capital of Darwin,
as well as the Centrepoint Tower shopping center and office tower
in Sydney were evacuated Thursday in a series of false alarms.
	   ``It's a reminder that that kind of urban terrorism, I suppose,
is a modern day reality in every society,'' Prime Minister John
Howard said Friday on radio.
	   ``We've been refreshingly freer of it than most other societies
and I hope that continues to be the case.
	   ``But unhinged human nature can become a very lethal weapon if
it's triggered off by particular events,'' he said.
	   Twenty-seven potentially lethal parcel bombs have been found at
addresses in Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne and the Gold Coast over
the past 48 hours.
	   Most of the potentially deadly parcels had been addressed to
former or current Australian Taxation Office staff, but some
members of the Human Rights Commission also were targeted.
	   Police have named Dunstan, a suspended tax officer who got
embroiled in an affair with a woman at his office, as the sole
suspect in the case.
	   Dunstan has been involved in a sexual harassment case at the tax
office in Canberra involving the woman he had the relationship
with, and was appealing his dismissal to the Federal Court.
	   Only the first of the letter bombs caused any injury.
	   Two postal workers, at the Canberra mail sorting center were
slightly injured, after one of them threw one of the letter bombs
into a mail bag early Wednesday morning.
	   Police say they cannot be sure there are no more letter bombs in
Australia's mail system, which is presently overflowing with
Christmas parcels.
	   They have urged people throughout Australia to be cautious if
they see suspicious parcels in their mail.

Jordan rejoins labor talks with season in jeopardy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with talks ending after 10 1/2 hours &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ After 10 1/2 hours of labor talks Thursday
night, this was the result of the longest negotiating session of
the five-month NBA lockout: a standoff.
	   ``It may sound difficult to believe, but we met for 10 or more
hours and made little or no progress,'' commissioner David Stern
said.
	   Michael Jordan was back at the bargaining table when talks
resumed, yet his magic touch did little to get the sides closer
together.
	   ``His understanding was that a new proposal was going to be
made'' by the owners, agent David Falk said, ``and he wanted to be
there to listen to it. You can read into it that he's continuing to
be involved and supportive of the union leadership.''
	   During the first few hours of one of the session, Stern made
another plea to save the season.
	   Also, according to a player who was in the meeting, Madison
Square Garden president David Checketts sparred with union lawyers,
and Jordan did not get as involved as he did when he attended Oct.
28.
	   No new formal proposals were put forward as the sides mostly
covered old ground. The talks ended shortly before midnight EST.
	   Jordan left early in the evening, and returned about three hours
later to the glee of a small crowd gathered outside a hotel across
from NBA headquarters.
	   Just a few hours earlier, strangely enough, hardly noticed when
one of the greatest peacemakers in American history _ former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger _ walked across the very same
stretch of sidewalk.
	   Trying to end the dispute that threatens to wipe out the entire
season, the sides spent the first two hours merely ``feeling each
other out,'' Stern said, then went back to work after a lunch
break. The bargaining session was the first in 13 days with both
full negotiating committees in attendance.
	   If the owners and players can't come up with a solution in the
next few weeks, the entire 1998-99 season likely will be canceled.
	   Jordan's arrival marked the first time he had joined the talks
since Oct. 28, when he spent about 8 1/2 hours at the bargaining
table and tried to help broker a deal.
	   The sides met one other time since then, on Nov. 20, and called
it their most productive session to date. But things quickly
unraveled.
	   Pressure for a settlement and panic over the fate of the season
increased in recent days, with former union president Isiah Thomas
suggesting that Billy Hunter and Patrick Ewing be replaced as the
union's lead negotiators.
	   ``The one message I know he (Jordan) is delivering emphatically
is that people like Isiah can sit on the sidelines and criticize,
but when you are in the game it's harder,'' Falk said.
	   The first order of major business was to decide whether to
continue negotiating under the framework that the sides had
discussed in two previous sessions _ a six- or seven-year agreement
with a complicated ``escrow tax'' system in the final three or four
years.
	   The proposals put on the table Nov. 20 would include players
having 10 or 15 percent of their paychecks withheld if spending on
overall player salaries exceeded a targeted percentage of revenues.
	   The owners have asked for a 50-50 split, while the players have
tied many of their concessions to receiving 60 percent.
	   The owners moved to 53 percent on Nov. 20 and the players
dropped to 57 percent, but those concessions became void under the
ground rules that have been set for the new talks. That is,
everything discussed at the Nov. 20 meeting is disregarded.
	   ``This lockout won't end until the owners get as much as they
can out of the players,'' Alonzo Mourning of the Miami Heat said as
he arrived for the renewed talks. ``It comes down to greed on their
part.''

Anwar trial marked by frayed tempers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prosecution and defense attorneys
clashed again Friday in the corruption and sexual misconduct trial
of jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim.
	   When Azizan Abu Bakar, a former driver of Anwar's wife who
testified Anwar repeatedly sodomized him, wavered during
cross-examination, prosecution lawyers leapt to help him.
	   That prompted angry remarks from Christopher Fernando, one of
the nine lawyers defending the sacked deputy prime minister and
finance minister.
	   ``The answer is being given to the witness,'' Fernando told the
trial judge, Augustine Paul.
	   Peeved at being interrupted, Prosecutor Abdul Gani Patail
shouted back: ``Let me finish.''
	   Tempers rose when Fernando repeatedly asked Azizan why he was
giving contradictory answers about waiting for five years to make
public the accusations that Anwar repeatedly sodomized him in 1992.
	   Prosecutors are trying to prove Anwar abused his powers by
forcing police to obtain retractions from Azizan and Ummi Hafilda
Ali, the sister of his former secretary, to cover up his sexual
trysts.
	   Ummi Hafilda, whom Azizan says convinced him to make the
allegations public in 1997, has separately accused Anwar of having
sex with her brother's wife.
	   The accusations of the two people form the backbone of the
prosecution case and the 10 charges of corruption and illegal sex
against Anwar, 51, who denies them.
	   On Thursday, Azizan testified that he had never considered
disclosing the alleged sex with Anwar until he met Ummi. But during
questioning on Friday he said he had intended to tell some people
earlier.
	   ``I had intended to tell certain parties before, but I was
confident that no one would believe that Anwar sodomized me,'' he
said.
	   Fernando: ``You are lying brazenly to the court. You are not
able to explain this contradiction despite having been given the
opportunity.''
	   Azizan insisted he was not lying. ``As a Muslim it would be
apostasy for me to fictionalize my account and permit a leader who
is a sodomizer to become a prime minister.''
	   Azizan first made the allegations in a statement in 1997. On
Thursday, he startled the court by saying he met Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad 10 days before the Malaysian leader sacked his
deputy.
	   Anwar was arrested on Sept. 20. The first trial involves four
counts of corruption. He will be tried later for one more
corruption charge and five charges of illegal sex.

Antiaircraft missile accidentally fired, at least three injured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ At least three people were injured
when an antiaircraft missile was accidentally fired into the sky
over the western city of Inchon on Friday, the Defense Ministry and
police said.
	   Those injured suffered minor cuts on their heads and hands by
tiny metal fragments from the missile that exploded in the air,
police said.
	   About 20 cars were also damaged with their windshields and other
parts hit by the fragments, police said.
	   The explosion started brush fires in nearby hills but they were
put out by 10 fire trucks, they said.
	   Ministry officials said a South Korean army soldier accidentally
fired the Nike-Hercules missile during a routine check of its
launcher shortly before noon.
	   The missile exploded about 200 kilometers (131 miles) above the
city, sending a shower of hundreds of metal fragments over a nearby
residential area, it said.
	   Inchon is about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the heavily
guarded border with communist North Korea.

Faldo takes pointers from The Von, and turns his game around
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Most champion golfers would resent
casual observations from the sidelines, especially after a
particularly frustrating round. But the right words from the right
spectator helped turn Nick Faldo's game around Friday.
	   ``The Von gave me a lesson yesterday,'' the Englishman said
after improving his first-round 5-over par 77 at the Australian
Open by eight strokes in the second.
	   He credits a quick chat with international legend Norman Von
Nida after Thursday's first round, which included five bogeys on
the difficult Royal Adelaide course, for the improvement.
	   ``He came up and found me after 18,'' Faldo said of the
84-year-old Von Nida, who won the Australian Open in 1950, 1952 and
1953.
	   ``He was very complimentary of my game (but) he said there was
just one thing _ he said my grip pressure in my left hand was too
tight and that was what was causing all the trouble.''
	   Faldo took the advice, loosening the left hand. He also took The
Von's advice on putting, strengthening his right hand, which
repositioned his right elbow and shoulder.
	   During practice shots overnight at the range, it fell into
place.
	   ``It all made sense,'' Faldo said. ``I thought, it takes that
sort of guy to spot it . . . the older generation, they've seen it
all. They really know all the little bits that really work.''
	   Von Nida was humble about his assistance.
	   ``I think Nick Faldo is one of the best ball strokers in the
world, and one of golf's great players,'' Von Nida said.
	   ``I don't really think he needs any help, but if he gives me
credit for helping his game, then that's my privilege.''
	   From a position where he was in danger of missing the halfway
cut, Faldo goes safely into the third round after shooting a
3-under-par 69 Friday, including a run of consecutive birdies on
the sixth, seventh and eight holes.
	   ``That was a big improvement,'' Faldo said.
	   ``I hit balls last night at the range, trying to hit them with
the least amount of pressure in my left hand. It gets the club
freer going back,'' he said.
	   ``It was a new day again today.''

Report: Indonesian government seeks big tax payment for car project
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian government is demanding
the payment of 3.39 trillion rupiah (dlrs 440 million) in import
duty and luxury tax exemptions from car maker PT Timor Putra
Nasional, a company run by former President Suharto's youngest son
Hutomo Mandala ``Tommy'' Putra, a report said Friday.
	   Quoting the director general of excise and customs Martiono
Hadianto, the newspaper Bisnis Indonesia reported that the
government has sent a letter to the company for the immediate
payment of the funds.
	   ``This is the final calculation, and there will be no more
bargaining because everything is included and we sent the bill to
Timor,'' Martiono said, according to the report.
	   Kia Motors Corp. the South Korean maker of the cars, was to buy
auto parts from Indonesia worth 25 percent of the value of the
assembled cars to be exported to Indonesia.
	   Timor is obliged to have a certain percentage of local content
in the car. The cars were supposed to have 20 percent local
components by the end of first year, 40 percent by the end of the
second and 60 percent by the end of the third year.
	   But Trade and Industry Minister Rahardi Ramelan has said that
none of the requirements were ever met by Timor, and the company
should be penalized.
	   Timor was the sole recipient of import duty and luxury tax
exemptions as part of the national car program.
	   The national car program, initiated in 1995, was terminated last
year as one of the conditions for receiving funds from the
International Monetary Fund.
	   Demands for back taxes grew after Suharto quit the presidency
last May after a wave of protests and riots.
	   Since that time there have been growing calls for Suharto and
his family to be prosecuted for corruption.
	   Critics allege the Suharto clan built huge business empires
through the abuse of presidential power and graft.
	   Suharto has denied any wrongdoing.

Report: 1,021 killed in province during military campaign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A decade-long military campaign
against separatist guerrillas in a northern Indonesian province
left 1,021 people dead, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   The death toll reported by the governor of Aceh province is
higher than the figure cited by the Indonesian military, which said
760 people died in the campaign that ended this year.
	   Aceh, about 1,750 kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of Jakarta,
is a staunchly Muslim province where rebels have been fighting for
an Islamic state for decades.
	   Accused of widespread atrocities in Aceh, the military
apologized and withdrew some troops in a conciliatory gesture after
the resignation in May of former President Suharto.
	   Gov. Sjamsuddin Mahmud said most of the victims were civilians,
the Kompas newspaper reported. He said 862 people were missing,
4,521 children had been orphaned and 681 houses were burned.
	   The National Commission on Human Rights, a government panel,
said 781 people were killed.
	   The military has also been accused of abuses while trying to
quell armed separatist movements in remote Irian Jaya province as
well as the former Portuguese colony of East Timor.

Ramos Horta: Downer ``gutless'' over 1975 East Timor killings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ East Timorese activist Jose Ramos
Horta on Friday labeled Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
``gutless'' for his soft stance over the 1975 killing of five
newsmen in East Timor.
	   He said he was astounded by Downer's reaction to news last week
that Indonesia would refuse former National Crime Authority
chairman Tom Sherman access to the country to investigate claims
the five were executed by Indonesian troops.
	   Downer said he never expected Indonesia to allow Sherman access,
but said ``We certainly thought it was worth a try.''
	   ``Is that the response from a foreign minister of a proud
country like Australia which gives billions of dollars in aid to
Indonesia?'' Ramos Horta said.
	   ``It escapes my limited intelligence to understand this kind of
behavior.''
	   The Nobel Peace laureate said Australia should follow the
example of Spain, which is attempting to extradite former Chilean
dictator Augusto Pinochet from Britain to face genocide charges.
	   ``If Australia had any guts, any sense of national honor and
dignity they would do like the Spaniards have done with Pinochet,''
Ramos Horta said.
	   ``Pinochet murdered Spanish citizens, about 80 of them. It took
time but they slowly tracked him down.''
	   Sherman's original 1996 report found the five newsmen, who were
killed at Balibo during Indonesia's invasion of the former
Portuguese colony, probably died during a battle between
Indonesian-led troops and Timorese resistance fighters.
	   However, people claiming to be eyewitnesses have now come
forward alleging they were murdered by troops led by Yunus Yosfiah
_ now Indonesia's Information Minister.
	   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie last week rejected a request
by Defense Minister John Moore for Sherman to be allowed to visit
Timor to investigate the new claims.
	   Ramos Horta said he was angry with the way Downer brushed aside
criticism of Indonesia's refusal.
	   ``It is gutless when Australia does not even bother about its
citizens,'' he said.
	   ``The question that arises is then: how can we East Timorese
have illusions that they will bother about East Timor when they
don't care, they don't have the guts to protect their own
citizens?''

Report: Few political parties eligible to contest ballot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Only about eight out of more than 100
new political parties will probably be eligible to contest
parliamentary elections in Indonesia next June, a news report said
Friday.
	   Dozens of parties have mushroomed following last May's
resignation of authoritarian President Suharto, who previously
controlled political activity in the world's fourth most populous
nation.
	   On Thursday, the government announced that elections would be
held June 7.
	   Under Suharto, only three parties could contest elections and
their policies and candidates were strictly vetted.
	   Suharto's successor and former protege, President B.J. Habibie,
has promised to open up the political process to greater democracy.
	   However, he has maintained that new parties must adhere to basic
principles.
	   The proposed electoral law says membership of parties must be
open to all ethnic and religious groups.
	   They also need to operate branches in at least half of
Indonesia's 27 provinces or be able to collect 1 million signatures
of support.
	   The Indonesian Observer newspaper quoted a government official
as saying only a handful of parties currently meet these and other
requirements that are contained in a proposed electoral law now
before the Parliament.
	   Home Affairs Ministry official Ryaas Rasyid, who helped draft
the proposed law, said only eight parties conformed to the bill's
requirements. These included the three parties that had operated
during the Suharto era.
	   Following the June election, Indonesia's highest legislative
grouping, the People's Consultative Assembly, will convene on Aug.
29 to select a new head of state.
	   Habibie and several others have indicated they will stand for
the presidency.
	   Despite his promises of democratic reform, Habibie is the target
of a rising tide of protests by students who say his timetable for
change is too slow and does not go far enough.
	   The students, who helped force Suharto to quit after a wave of
protests and riots in May, also want the former leader tried for
corruption and human rights abuses during his 32-year rule.
	   There is also widespread discontent with Habibie's management of
Indonesia's economy, which is enduring its worst crisis in decades.

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ In a show of determination to extend its
crackdown on dissent to cyberspace, China is putting a computer
entrepreneur on trial Friday for giving e-mail addresses to an
Internet pro-democracy magazine.
	   Lin Hai, 30, was to be tried in a closed courtroom on charges of
subversion for giving addresses of 30,000 Chinese computer users to
``VIP Reference,'' a journal published by Chinese dissidents
abroad.
	   Two defense lawyers are allowed in with Lin, but his wife and
other spectators are barred. Most trials in Shanghai are open, but
that policy makes an exception for privacy cases and government
secrets.
	   Lin, who owns a Shanghai software company, was arrested in March
and charged the next month with ``inciting the overthrow of state
power.''
	   The case marks a turning point in the Communist Party's attempt
to harness the Internet for economic development while stamping out
attempts to use it to spread dissent.
	   China keeps close watch on the Internet. Special task forces
have been set up to monitor the system. Service providers are
required to register all users with the government and
technological barriers have been installed to try to block sites
deemed subversive or pornographic.
	   The group Human Rights in China on Friday demanded Lin's release
and called the decision to put him on trial a ``blatant violation
of the right to freedom of expression.''
	   The group, based in New York, called his detention arbitrary and
noted the recent arrests of political activists who have tried to
set up an opposition party.
	   ``These are a clear illustration that Beijing is taking no step
whatsoever in respecting fundamental human rights,'' the group's
executive director, Xiao Qiang, said in a statement.
	   He called China's recent signing of the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights an ``empty gesture.''
	   Lin's wife, Xu Hong, says she has written to President Jiang
Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji asking for their help but has received
no reply.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Commissioner David Stern said it was ``more
likely we won't have a season than we will have a season'' after
nearly a full day of talks Thursday did little to end the
five-month-old NBA lockout.
	   ``It may sound difficult to believe, but we met for 10 or more
hours and made little or no progress,'' he said.
	   Union leader Billy Hunter was equally pessimistic.
	   ``They are being oppressive, overreacting and we are not
inclined to give in,'' he said. ``We're not turning back.''
	   For a third time, the union asked that the stalemate be resolved
by a mediator. Once again, the league declined.
	   The sides plan to talk on the phone in the next few days before
setting up any more bargaining sessions.
	   Michael Jordan was back at the bargaining table when talks
resumed, yet his presence did little to get the sides closer
together during their longest negotiating session yet.
	   ``His understanding was that a new proposal was going to be
made'' by the owners, agent David Falk said, ``and he wanted to be
there to listen to it. You can read into it that he's continuing to
be involved and supportive of the union leadership.''
	   After the talks ended, Stern and Hunter suggested there was
still room for a settlement.
	   ``We don't say this is our last, final, no-holds barred offer,''
Stern said.
	   But he also said: ``As I stand here today, it's more likely we
won't have a season than we will have a season.''
	   According to a player who was in the meeting, Madison Square
Garden president David Checketts sparred with union lawyers, and
Jordan did not get as involved as he did when he attended Oct. 28.
	   No new formal proposals were put forward as the sides mostly
covered old ground and moved back to positions similar to where
they stood after an 8{-hour session Nov. 20. The talks ended
shortly before midnight EST.
	   Jordan left early in the evening, and returned about three hours
later to the glee of a small crowd gathered outside a hotel across
from NBA headquarters.
	   Trying to end the dispute that threatens to wipe out the entire
season, the sides spent the first two hours merely ``feeling each
other out,'' Stern said. The bargaining session was the first in 13
days with both full negotiating committees in attendance.
	   Jordan's arrival marked the first time he had joined the talks
since Oct. 28, when he spent about 8 1/2 hours at the bargaining
table and tried to help broker a deal.
	   The sides met one other time since then, on Nov. 20, and called
it their most productive session to date. But things quickly
unraveled.
	   Pressure for a settlement and panic over the fate of the season
increased in recent days, with former union president Isiah Thomas
suggesting that Hunter and Patrick Ewing be replaced as the union's
lead negotiators.
	   ``The one message I know he (Jordan) is delivering emphatically
is that people like Isiah can sit on the sidelines and criticize,
but when you are in the game it's harder,'' Falk said.
	   The first order of major business was to decide whether to
continue negotiating under the framework that the sides had
discussed in two previous sessions _ a six- or seven-year agreement
with a complicated ``escrow tax'' system in the final three or four
years.
	   By the end of the night, it was clear they were continuing to
discuss the same framework. Stern even appeared at a late press
conference with a multi-colored chart that illustrated how the
owners' proposal would effect salaries.
	   The proposals put on the table Nov. 20 would include players
having 10 or 15 percent of their paychecks withheld if spending on
overall player salaries exceeded a targeted percentage of revenues.
	   The owners have asked 53 percent and the players want 57 percent
_ positions the sides returned to Thursday night after backing off
those numbers for almost two weeks..
	   ``This lockout won't end until the owners get as much as they
can out of the players,'' Alonzo Mourning of the Miami Heat said as
he arrived for the renewed talks. ``It comes down to greed on their
part.''

Power blackout has Hong Kong traders dealing in the dark
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A brief power failure hit Hong Kong's business
district early Friday, but traders kept buying and selling in their
darkened dealing rooms.
	   ``Our trading floor lost lights and air conditioning, but
trading was uninterrupted,'' said Randy Gilmore, chief executive of
the Hong Kong Futures Exchange.
	   The Hong Kong Stock Exchange stayed on-line, a spokeswoman said,
though investment banks Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers were
temporarily affected.
	   Power went down for two to three minutes in parts of the
business district, known as ``Central,'' which houses most major
banks, brokerages and the two exchanges, according to Hong Kong
Electric Holdings Ltd.
	   A business tower that houses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,
the territory's de facto central bank, had its power interrupted
for about 50 minutes, the spokesman said.
	   The monetary authority's computers and lighting systems were all
operating, though the elevators stopped, a spokeswoman said.
	   When power was restored to most of the central business
district, a resulting surge cut power for a few seconds to other
customers. Lights switched off and on and computers went down and
then re-booted.

Taiwan sees drop in vote buying as tough measures take hold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ One traditional way to get votes in Taiwan
has been to buy them, but reports of such troubles dropped
dramatically ahead of Saturday's elections, the justice minister
said Friday.
	   Cheng Chung-mo credited tougher enforcement, including cash
rewards for citizens who turn in people who buy votes.
	   ``All those sellers and buyers of votes, candidates and ordinary
citizens, can feel the severity of the judicial bodies. They aren't
so hot about going up against justice,'' Cheng told a news
conference.
	   The Justice Ministry had received 734 reports of vote buying as
of Friday morning compared to 1,278 such reports at the same point
in similar campaigns three years ago, Cheng said.
	   Rewards of up to 10 million Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 300,000)
for information leading to vote buying convictions have aided the
crackdown, he said. The government paid out over 102 million Taiwan
dollars (U.S. dlrs 3 million) in rewards in 1995, Cheng said.
	   Of the reports of vote buying received this year, 607 were
related to the campaign for the 225-seat national Legislature,
where competition is intense.
	   Elections are also being held for the mayors of Taipei and
Kaohsiung, where 29 cases were under investigation, Cheng said.
	   Another 98 cases related to the races for the municipal councils
of those cities are also being investigated, Cheng said.
	   The opposition routinely accuses the ruling Nationalist Party of
buying votes to retain their grasp on power, but Cheng wouldn't
comment on the party affiliations of candidates whose supporters
were under investigation.
	   Some voters might also have been discouraged to see the price
for their support going down.
	   Newspapers have reported up to 1,000 Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs
31) is being offered for votes in these elections, significantly
less than in past polls.

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ In a show of determination to extend its
crackdown on dissent to cyberspace, China is putting a computer
entrepreneur on trial Friday for giving e-mail addresses to an
Internet pro-democracy magazine.
	   Lin Hai, 30, was to be tried in a closed courtroom on charges of
subversion for giving addresses of 30,000 Chinese computer users to
``VIP Reference,'' a journal published by Chinese dissidents
abroad.
	   Two defense lawyers are allowed in with Lin, but his wife and
other spectators are barred.
	   A man's voice shouted ``Hang up! Hang up!'' when Lin's wife, Xu
Hong, was reached on her mobile telephone, and the line went dead
and afterward was switched off. Ms. Xu had planned to provide
comments and any available updates by phone, and the broken
connection suggested police may have detained her.
	   Outside the court, about half a dozen uniformed police and other
plainclothes officers watched foreign reporters, and one person
videotaped them. Reporters were not allowed inside the court gate.
	   Lin, who owns a Shanghai software company, was arrested in March
and charged the next month with ``inciting the overthrow of state
power.''
	   The case marks a turning point in the Communist Party's attempt
to harness the Internet for economic development while stamping out
attempts to use it to spread dissent.
	   China keeps close watch on the Internet. Special task forces
have been set up to monitor the system. Service providers are
required to register all users with the government and
technological barriers have been installed to try to block sites
deemed subversive or pornographic.
	   The group Human Rights in China on Friday demanded Lin's release
and called the decision to put him on trial a ``blatant violation
of the right to freedom of expression.''
	   The group, based in New York, called his detention arbitrary and
noted the recent arrests of political activists who have tried to
set up an opposition party.
	   ``These are a clear illustration that Beijing is taking no step
	   whatsoever in respecting fundamental human rights,'' the group's
executive director, Xiao Qiang, said in a statement.
	   He called China's recent signing of the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights an ``empty gesture.''
	   Lin's wife, Xu Hong, says she has written to President Jiang
Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji asking for their help but has received
no reply.

Sales of imported vehicles in Japan down 17.1 percent in November
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hit by a prolonged economic slump, sales of
imported cars, trucks and buses in Japan tumbled 17.1 percent last
month compared to a year ago to 22,250 vehicles, a Japanese
industry association said Friday.
	   November marked the 20th month of year-on-year declines in sales
of imported vehicles, the Japan Automobile Importers Association
said.
	   Sales of foreign-made passenger cars fell 15.4 percent last
month to 21,672 units, while sales of imported trucks plunged 54.5
percent to 565 units.
	   A total of 13 imported buses were sold in November, compared
with none a year ago.
	   A spokesman for the auto importers' association blamed the poor
sales on skittish consumers who are reluctant to spend amid Japan's
worst recession since World War II.
	   According to recent data by a Japanese automakers' association,
sales of domestic vehicles in November fell 15.9 percent, also
dropping for a 20th straight month.
	   Overall sales of imported vehicles slid party due to a sharp
fall in so-called reverse imports of cars made in Japanese-owned
plants overseas. Reverse import sales in November totaled 3,023,
down 34.1 percent.
	   By country, sales of passenger car imports from the United
States fell 24.7 percent to 5,474. General Motors Corp.'s sales
dropped 25.6 percent to 1,315, Ford Motor Co.'s sales fell 30.9
percent to 333, and sales of cars made by Chrysler Corp., now
DaimlerChrysler AG, tumbled 60.1 percent to 477.
	   British-made car sales plunged 50.5 percent to 1,301, as sales
of the Rover sank 53.7 percent to 1,098.
	   Passenger car imports from Germany totaled 11,848 in November,
unchanged from a year ago. Volkswagen and Audi sales together
totaled 4,005, up 3.6 percent from a year ago. BMW sales rose 10.5
percent to 2,576 and Mercedes sales grew 11.9 percent to 3,252.
	   Among other major imports, sales of imported cars from Sweden
fell 28.7 percent to 1,025, sales from France dropped 13 percent to
575 and sales from Spain declined 28.5 percent to 338.
	   Sales from Italy rose 36 percent to 574, helped by a 40.8
percent rise in Fiat sales to 566, the association said.

Sihanouk lobbies for Cambodia's admission into ASEAN at summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk has urged the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations to accept Cambodia as a full
member at its Dec. 15-16 summit in Hanoi, saying all conditions
have been met.
	   Following the formation of a new coalition government headed by
Prime Minister Hun Sen, ``Cambodia now deserves its place in ASEAN,
the sooner the better,'' King Sihanouk said in letters to ASEAN
government leaders.
	   Sihanouk wrote Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai, the host
of the summit, seeking ``favorable consideration.''
	   Several members of the nine-nation regional grouping have
expressed hesitation toward allowing Cambodia quick entry, saying
time needs to be given to Hun Sen's government to pass preparatory
laws and demonstrate its stability.
	   Cambodia was on the verge of joining ASEAN last year when Hun
Sen toppled his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a
violent coup.
	   Membership was put on hold pending painstaking diplomacy that
led to Ranariddh's return, parliamentary elections in July and,
after much wrangling, a coalition deal last month.
	   Hun Sen is making entry into ASEAN and filling Cambodia's vacant
seat at the United Nations _ key to establishing international
legitimacy to regain lost foreign aid _ his top priorities.
	   ASEAN presently groups Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia,
Brunei, the Philippines, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam.
	   Foreign Minister Hor Nam Hong is due to travel Friday to present
credentials to reclaim the U.N. seat.

Newspaper: Indonesian illegal miners go on rampage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of illegal gold miners burned
several offices and eleven vehicles belonging to the state mining
company near Jakarta, a news report said Friday.
	   The rampage on Thursday began after police tried to disperse a
group of villagers who were mining at the government-owned Pongkor
mine near Bogor, 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of Jakarta.
	   Police fired warning shots and one ricocheting bullet grazed the
ear of a miner, triggering the riot by angry crowds, the Kompas
newspaper reported.
	   The violence broke out as security officials continued to search
for the bodies of victims of a landslide last week that killed up
to 16 illegal miners.
	   In July, another landslide at the mine also killed 16 people.
	   Authorities complain of a rise in illegal mining by people
willing to risk their lives to beat the effects of Indonesia's
worst economic crisis in 30 years.

Two more lawmakers from Myanmar's main opposition party resign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Two more elected representatives from
Myanmar's main opposition party have resigned because of ill
health, state-run newspapers reported on Friday.
	   The Southeast Asian country's military government has detained
nearly 900 members of the opposition National League for Democracy
after the party's leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu
Kyi, tried unsuccessfully to convene a session of Parliament in
September.
	   Since then, seven opposition lawmakers have resigned from the
party, citing ill health, and 384 others has been released from
detention after promising the military they would no longer
participate in NLD activities.
	   Those who have vowed not to resign their membership in the
opposition party are still being detained.
	   Government-run newspapers in Myanmar, also known as Burma, have
called the resignations voluntary.
	   But Suu Kyi told reporters last month that the military has
coerced NLD members into quitting, and that her party's leadership
will not recognize the resignations.
	   Saw Shwe from Mandalay and Ye Myint from Irrawaddy Division were
the latest legislators to resign ostensibly because of ill health,
according to The New Light of Myanmar newspaper.
	   Both won their Parliamentary seats in a 1990 election _ the
results of which the military refused to honor after the NLD won
392 of the legislature's 485 seats.
	   Suu Kyi was under six years of house arrest at the time for her
political activities and so did not run in the election.
	   The military government has never allowed the freely elected
Parliament to meet, and Suu Kyi's attempt to convene the body
triggered the mass arrests in September.

Antiaircraft missile accidentally fired
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATEs with missile automatically destroyed; CORRECTs height
at which missile exploded &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ At least three people were injured
Friday when an anti-aircraft missile was accidentally fired over
the western city of Inchon, officials said.
	   Those injured suffered minor cuts on their heads and hands by
tiny metal fragments from the missile that exploded in the air,
police said.
	   About 20 cars were also damaged by the fragments, police said.
The explosion started brush fires in nearby hills but they were
quickly put out.
	   Defense Ministry officials said a South Korean soldier
accidentally fired the Nike-Hercules missile during a routine check
of its launcher shortly before noon.
	   The missile was automatically destroyed by a built-in safety
device seconds after it left the launcher, sending a shower of
hundreds of metal fragments over a nearby residential area, they
said.
	   One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
missile was believed to have been destroyed before it reached a
height of 500 meters (yards).
	   Inchon is about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the heavily
guarded border with communist North Korea.
	   The two Koreas are technically at war, with no peace treaty
signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.

Philippine stocks end higher on last-minute bargain hunting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ After three days of losses,
Philippine stocks capped a volatile session Friday with modest
gains from last-minute bargain hunting.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index ended 15.61 points,
or 0.9 percent, higher at 1,822.64, recovering from a nearly
50-point dip in early trading following the release of
disappointing November inflation data.
	   On Thursday, the index plunged 78.97 points, or 4.2 percent,
bringing its total loss since Tuesday to 168.33 points, or 8.5
percent.
	   Gainers exceeded decliners Friday 54 to 43, while 31 issues
closed unchanged.
	   Jose Ricardo Garcia, vice president for Diversified Securities
Inc., said the worse-than-expected November inflation data
triggered a knee-jerk reaction among investors, who went on a
selling spree soon after trading started.
	   Before the market opened, the government reported that inflation
in November was 11.2 percent on an annual basis, up from 10.2
percent the previous month and the highest level since January
1996.
	   The government blamed sharp increases in food prices for the
higher inflation rate.
	   Garcia said the 184.86-point, or 2.04 percent, loss suffered
overnight by the Dow Jones Industrial Average further encouraged
selling.
	   The market's early weakness, however, soon gave way to bargain
hunting, attesting to the market's resilience, Garcia said.
	   He said the rise in last month's consumer price index shouldn't
be cause for concern since the average inflation rate from January
to November remains in the single-digits at 9.7 percent.
	   ``Inflation has been kept in check despite the economic
slowdown,'' he said.
	   In currency trading, the peso weakened against the U.S. dollar
in early trading, weighed down by concern about the inflation
figures, traders said.
	   But by midafternoon, the dollar averaged 38.810 pesos, up from
Thursday's average of 38.759 pesos.
	   The peso's early loss was offset by continuing dollar inflows,
chiefly from overseas Filipino workers, traders said.
	   An estimated 4.5 million Filipinos work abroad, sending home at
least dlrs 6 billion last year. Their foreign-exchange remittances
provide an important contribution to the Philippine economy, and
are expected to help support the peso over the rest of the year.

Dollar slides against yen, Japanese stocks finish lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and bond

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar slid against the yen Friday amid
deepening worries about Brazil's economy and the outlook for U.S.
stock prices. Tokyo stock prices finished lower.
	   The dollar bought 118.16 yen in mid-afternoon, down 1.07 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level
of 118.60 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 57.11 points,
or 0.39 percent, closing the week at 14,639.97 points. On Thursday,
the index had shed 289.54 points, or 1.93 percent.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar continued to weaken as
investors were discouraged by the continuing decline in U.S. stocks
and Wednesday's defeat in the Brazilian Congress of an important
government austerity measure.
	   Kazuo Takayama, chief foreign exchange manager at Midland Bank
in Tokyo, said the market is becoming ``very nervous about the
American economy, and the Dow is falling.''
	   In New York Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
184.86 points to 8,879.68, largely affected by the Brazilian stock
market's plunge following the move by Congress.
	   Also weighing on the dollar was speculation that the Federal
Reserve may respond to a move by 11 European nations, which jointly
lowered interest rates on Thursday, traders said.
	   The rate-cutting moves by the 11 countries joining in the common
currency were designed to combat a recent bout of economic weakness
in Europe while easing concerns in financial market.
	   On the Tokyo stock market, share prices fell in thin trading on
selling of international blue chip shares in line with an overnight
fall on Wall Street.
	   Investors retreated to the sidelines to watch what impact a
coordinated rate cut by major European central banks Thursday will
have on the global economy.
	   ``Trade is thin because there are many factors in Japan and
overseas working to keep investors out of the market,'' said
Masatoshi Sato, manager of the investor information group at
Kankaku Securities.
	   On Thursday, the Economic Planning Agency said Japan's gross
domestic product contracted 0.7 percent in the July-September
quarter from the previous quarter for an annualized drop of 2.6
percent.
	   The latest GDP, which measures all goods and services produced
in a given period, showed Japan remains mired in its worst
recession since World War II.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 8.17 points, or 0.72 percent, to 1,120.72. The
TOPIX fell 18.26 points, or 1.59 percent, the previous day.
	   The benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government bond fell to
1.075 percent from Thursday's close of 1.090 percent, driving its
price up to 106.26 yen from the previous day's finish of 106.13
yen.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Dozens of lawyers in black robes
marched to a courthouse Friday in solidarity for an attorney who
faces three months imprisonment for contempt of court in the trial
of politician Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Several dozen pro-Anwar activists joined the lawyers as they
shouted, ``We want justice,'' in front of the federal courthouse.
	   Inside, Zainur Zakaria was before a three-judge bench hearing
his request to hold off on the imprisonment until his appeal was
heard.
	   If Zainur is jailed, it would be the first time in Malaysia that
a lawyer is imprisoned for such a long period for contempt while
defending a client. Previous such sentences have been a day or two
in jail.
	   Zainur was sentenced Monday after he refused to apologize for
accusing two prosecutors in Anwar's trial of trying to get a
potential witness to lie.
	   Anwar, who denies wrongdoing, is being tried on charges of four
counts of abuse of power. He will be tried later on another charge
of corruption and five charges of committing illegal sex acts.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar as deputy prime
minister on Sept. 2, saying he had determined his former protege as
too immoral to rule.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, prompting protests, both at home
and abroad.
	   The judge in Anwar's trial has said the allegations Zainur filed
in an affidavit were insulting to the prosecutors.
	   In the affidavit, two prosecutors were accused of trying to
cajole a potential witness into fabricating evidence of sex crimes
allegedly by Anwar.
	   It demanded the court remove senior government prosecutors Abdul
Gani Patail and Azahar Mohamed.

Newspaper: Indonesian illegal miners go on rampage

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of gold miners burned several
offices and 11 vehicles belonging to the state mining company near
Jakarta, a news report said Friday.
	   The rampage on Thursday began after police tried to disperse a
group of villagers who were mining at the government-owned Pongkor
mine near Bogor, 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of Jakarta.
	   Police fired warning shots and one ricocheting bullet grazed the
ear of a miner, setting off the riot by angry crowds, the Kompas
newspaper reported.
	   The violence broke out as security officials continued to search
for the bodies of victims of a landslide last week that killed up
to 16 illegal miners.
	   In July, another landslide at the mine also killed 16 people.
	   Authorities complain of a rise in illegal mining by people
willing to risk their lives to beat the effects of Indonesia's
worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   In a statement the mine's state-owned operator PT Aneka Tambang
accused some rioters of arson.
	   The company said no fatalities were reported, but rumors of a
death during the melee ``were sufficient to instigate villagers to
set fire to the company's property.
	   ``The extent of the damage or the potential impact on operations
as a result of this incident haven't yet been determined,'' it
said.

	   DARTFORD, England (AP) _ Police have detained 103 Romanians in
what they contend may be the largest single roundup of suspected
illegal immigrants in Britain.
	   The Romanians were arrested Thursday at Dartford International
Ferry Terminal, east of London, where they arrived after traveling
by ferry from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge, police said.
	   Inspector Dave Berry said officers spent more than two hours
locating the people and transporting them to four police stations.
Those detained include children, police said.
	   ``This is certainly the largest number that I've heard of,''
Berry said. ''We sometimes see about 15 at a time, I've never seen
this number before.''
	   Immigration officials planned to interview the Romanians on
Friday.

Government: Middle-aged Japanese concerned about the future
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's economic crisis and its rapidly aging
society have necessitated urgent reforms of wage, pension and
nursing systems to ensure the welfare of older citizens, the
government said Friday.
	   People in their 40s and 50s are increasingly frightened of
losing their jobs and of not receiving care when they join the
ballooning ranks of the elderly, the Economic Planning Agency said
in its white paper released Friday.
	   ``Concerns about the health of parents and children, coupled
with the current economic crisis and job uncertainty have led to
deep anxiety among middle-aged people,'' said the report called
``The Fears and Hopes of the Middle-Aged.''
	   The agency estimates the population of people over 65 will reach
31.88 million by 2015, or 25.2 percent of the overall population.
	   Japan's plummeting birthrate has prompted fears that there will
soon be a lack of young workers to support Japan's senior citizens.
	   The report recommended that corporate Japan dismantle its
seniority-based wage system to encourage middle-aged workers to
acquire specific skills that will enable them to find work, if they
are laid off.
	   Twice as many workers in their 40s and 50s were fired between
1994 and 1996 as those in their 20s and 30s, the report said. But
Japan's tradition of lifetime employment has blunted the motivation
for many workers to acquire professional skills.
	   Japan is suffering its worst recession since World War II, and
unemployment is at an all-time high as companies restructure.
	   In order to ensure the welfare of people in their 40s and 50s,
younger generations must also contribute more to shore up the
government pension system, imperiled by the falling birthrate.
	   New opportunities must also be created for seniors to become
less reliant on pensions by finding work after the mandatory
retirement age of 60.
	   ``We must create a society that's active for a whole lifetime,''
the agency said.
	   The agency also recommended the creation of a public nursing
insurance program that will enable families with elderly people to
hire home care.
	   That will liberate much of the work force tied up in caring for
elderly relatives, and could also encourage families to squirrel
away less money in savings, the report said.
	   ``There is a great fear that with the rising number of elderly
Japan won't be able to maintain its competitiveness and the health
of its finances,'' said Economic Planning Agency director Taichi
Sakaiya told reporters.

Thousands rally against attacks on Christians

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Christians closed their schools and took
off from their jobs Friday to denounce the rape of nuns, burning of
Bibles and other attacks that religious leaders say reflects
increasing intolerance under India's Hindu nationalist-led
government.
	   Roman Catholic Archbishop of Delhi Alan de Lastic, who addressed
some 5,000 people at a rally in central New Delhi, said government
pledges he has received to investigate the violence and punish
attackers were not enough.
	   ``We are demanding that the government do its duty,'' de Lastic
told reporters before driving from the rally to nearby Parliament.
There he handed over a memorandum asking the government to ensure
the safety of Christians, who make up about 2 percent of India's
nearly 1 billion people.
	   De Lastic's memorandum also called on the government to
``denounce all attempts to foist on the country a philosophy of one
nation, one people, one culture,'' _ a direct reference to the
slogans of the Bharatiya Janata Party.
	   Since the Hindu nationalist BJP took power as head of a 19-party
governing coalition earlier this year, it has been accused of
fanning religious tension.
	   The United Christian Forum for Human Rights, a group of lay
Christians who helped organize Friday's rally, said it had compiled
a list of almost 90 incidents of violence against Christians since
January. It said the figure was more than the total for the first
50 years of Indian independence in 1947.
	   Among the most serious of the attacks was the Sept. 24 rape of
four nuns by armed men in a village convent in central India.
	   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has asked the federal police
ministry to investigate all such incidents. B.P.Singh, the top
police ministry official, told reporters last month that many of
the incidents were purely criminal and had nothing to do with
religion.
	   Forum leader John Dayal accused the government of trying to play
down the problem. He called a Nov. 19 statement from India's
embassy in Washington, issued in response to U.S. media reports
about attacks on Indian Christians, ``a bloody lie.''
	   The statement accused reporters of wrongly attributing religious
motives to a few criminal incidents.
	   Christian schools and colleges across the country _ many among
India's elite institutions _ closed Friday in a protest strike
coinciding with the New Delhi rally. Francis Fernandes, who took
the day off from his job with the government-owned airline and
brought his wife and two children to the rally, said it was
important to speak out.
	   ``We must take part in this,'' added Fernandes's 13-year-old son
Nestor.
	   Hindus and Muslims also joined the rally. Shamsul Islam, member
of an interdenominational street theater group, came in a brightly
painted mask with pointed ears and a sign identifying him as the
demon of religious intolerance. He wandered among the other
protesters arm-in-arm with a fellow actor in the Nehru-style cap
Indian politicians often wear.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ All 18 crew members of a Russian fishing vessel
were rescued Friday after their boat sank in freezing waters off
the eastern island of Sakhalin, a news report said.
	   The Sputnik fishing boat was covered with a thick layer of ice,
and that apparently contributed to its sinking, said Konstantin
Sviridov, the duty captain at the Vladivostok maritime rescue
center.
	   The crew members were picked up by other Russian boats fishing
in the area and taken Sakhalin's southwest port of Nevelsk, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Look out, Kermit. Miss Piggy has launched
her own fragrance line, saying it has ``a certain je ne sais moi''
that makes her irresistible to the singing frog.
	   Her limited edition perfume, ``Moi,'' may be just a dab on the
wrist of the dlrs 6 billion U.S. fragrance industry. But for the
famed star of The Muppet Show, it's serious business _ and not
strictly for material reasons.
	   ``When I'm wearing 'Moi,' Kermit finds me more attractive, more
alluring than ever,'' Miss Piggy said Thursday. ``He just can't
keep his little flippers off me.''
	   Perfumers behind ``Moi,'' which hit shelves at Bloomingdale's
department stores last month for the holiday season, say it smells
like ``a bouquet of seductive flowers warmed with 'come-hither'
notes of warm blonde woods.''
	   But won't women be turned off by a perfume associated with a
pig?
	   ``One might think that, but I think that Miss Piggy herself is
so lovable that she brings with it not the normal feeling about pig
scents,'' said Nancy Lueck, a Bloomingdale's spokeswoman.
	   Topper Schroeder, who as president of Gendarme Fragrances of
West Hollywood helped the Muppet develop her scent, agreed.
	   ``Miss Piggy is the Elizabeth Taylor of that world,'' he said.
``This is not your ordinary pig. It had to be elegant, better than
anything else I can find on the market.''
	   Bloomingdale's would not release sales figures for ``Moi,'' but
Lueck claimed that even at dlrs 24 a bottle, it is proving to be a
hot item at the company's 23 stores around the country.
	   Some analysts were skeptical.
	   ``What do you think of when you think of Miss Piggy smell? It's
not good,'' said Laura Ries, president of Ries and Ries, a
marketing strategy group in Atlanta. ``She's a Muppet. Who wants to
smell like a Muppet?''
	   Miss Piggy begs to differ.
	   ``Moi am a pig _ but, moi am MORE than a pig,'' she said while
on location for her next film, ``Muppets From Space.''
	   ``Moi have written best-selling books. Moi have appeared in hit
motion pictures and television shows. Moi have appeared on the
cover of People, Life and TV Guide (magazines). So, don't look down
on me, buster _ look UP to me And if you're not careful, look OUT
for me!''

Movie stars protest U.S. attempt to open Korea's film market

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Carrying a mock coffin filled with
rolls of film, some 500 stars, directors and supporters marched in
Seoul Friday to protest U.S. demands to open South Korea's movie
market to more imports.
	   For years, South Korea has guarded its domestic movie industry
with a quota system, under which all local cinemas must screen
domestically produced films for at least 146 days a year.
	   The United States says the system constitutes an unfair trade
practice that discriminates against Hollywood. It has demanded
South Korea abolish or phase out the quota quickly.
	   ``America stop plotting to kill South Korean movies! We will
defend the screen quota to the death!'' the protesters chanted,
pumping their clenched fists into the freezing winter air.
	   Hundreds of police stood guard but did not intervene.
	   Some protesters were dressed in black and held up portraits of
movie stars to symbolize the death of the domestic movie industry.
	   Thousands of pedestrians stopped to watch the celebrities march
along the busy Myongdong commercial district in central Seoul,
carrying pickets and banners criticizing the U.S. and South Korean
governments.
	   They denounced the Seoul government as taking too weak a stand
against the United States.
	   ``This is not a matter of trade but a matter of defending our
culture against the onslaught of Hollywood commercialism,'' said
actor Moon Sung-kun, spokesman of the Emergency Committee to
Protect the Screen Quota System.
	   The committee delivered a protest letter to the U.S. Embassy.
	   Washington has turned up pressure on South Korea about the film
quota during recent talks for a free investment agreement.
	   Seoul considers such an accord with Washington vital to
attracting badly needed foreign investors to its battered economy.
	   During the latest round of talks in Washington in November,
South Korea proposed to cut the quota to 92 days a year, but the
United States rejected it, said officials at the Foreign and Trade
Ministry.
	   The United States reportedly is demanding that Seoul quicken the
phase-out. A fourth round of talks has been set for mid-December in
Seoul.
	   South Korea's past authoritarian governments had allowed only a
handful of foreign films to be screened here annually until the
country succumbed to U.S. pressure in 1986 and permitted foreign
film-makers to directly market their products here.
	   The country further opened its market in 1993 when it lifted its
control on the number of theaters where an imported film could be
shown at the same time.
	   The quota system has helped domestic movies, which accounted for
25 percent of the country's dlrs 231 million movie market last
year.
	   Owners of the country's 300 movie theaters privately say they
dislike the quota because Hollywood movies attract more crowds and
promise bigger revenues.

	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ In a show of determination to extend its
crackdown on dissent to cyberspace, China put a computer
entrepreneur on trial Friday on charges of giving e-mail addresses
to an Internet pro-democracy magazine.
	   Shanghai's No. 1 Intermediate People's Court held a closed-door
trial for Lin Hai on charges of subversion for giving addresses of
30,000 Chinese computer users to ``VIP Reference,'' a journal
published by Chinese dissidents in the United States.
	   Although Lin's lawyers were allowed inside the courtroom, even
his wife was barred from going inside. She may have been detained
by police.
	   A man's voice shouted ``Hang up! Hang up!'' when Xu Hong was
reached on her mobile telephone, and the line went dead and
afterward was switched off. Ms. Xu had planned to provide foreign
reporters with comments and pass on details from Lin's lawyers.
	   Outside the court, about half a dozen uniformed police and other
plainclothes officers watched foreign reporters, and one person
videotaped them. Reporters were not allowed inside the court gate.
	   The court did not plan to announce the verdict publicly, said
court administrator Ni Jinlong.
	   Lin, the 30-year-old owner of a Shanghai software company, was
arrested in March and charged the next month with ``inciting the
overthrow of state power.''
	   The case marks a turning point in the Communist Party's attempt
to harness the Internet for economic development while stamping out
attempts to use it to spread dissent.
	   His trial also comes amid an intensifying campaign against
dissidents trying to set up an opposition political party. Chinese
authorities have arrested two prominent democracy campaigners this
week and accused them and a third dissident of endangering state
security.
	   China keeps close watch on the Internet. Special task forces
have been set up to monitor the system. Service providers are
required to register all users with the government and
technological barriers have been installed to try to block sites
deemed subversive or pornographic.
	   The group Human Rights in China on Friday demanded Lin's release
and called the decision to put him on trial a ``blatant violation
of the right to freedom of expression.''
	   The group, based in New York, called his detention arbitrary and
noted the recent arrests of political activists who have tried to
set up an opposition party.
	   ``These are a clear illustration that Beijing is taking no step
whatsoever in respecting fundamental human rights,'' the group's
executive director, Xiao Qiang, said in a statement.
	   He called China's recent signing of the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights an ``empty gesture.''
	   Lin's wife, Xu Hong, says she has written to President Jiang
Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji asking for their help but has received
no reply.

Finance chief casts doubt on Japan achieving economic target
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Miyazawa urging Parliament to quickly approve
economic stimulus bills

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Amid more gloomy news on the economy, Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa expressed doubt Friday that Japan will
achieve its economic target for this fiscal year.
	   The comments came a day after the government announced the
Japanese economy had shrunk at an annualized rate of 2.6 percent in
the July-September quarter.
	   Miyazawa told reporters ``it will be a bit difficult'' to
achieve the government's target for a contraction of 1.8 percent
for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1999.
	   In order to achieve that target, Japan's real gross domestic
product would have to expand by 0.7 percent in both the
October-December and January-March quarters, Miyazawa said.
	   Thursday's announcement marked the first time the economy has
contracted for four consecutive quarters since the government
started compiling such statistics in 1955.
	   Miyazawa later told Parliament after the submission of an extra
budget to boost the economy, that Japan's economic situation
remains severe and urged legislators to swiftly approve the
stimulus measures.
	   Last month, Japan's government proposed a record 24 trillion yen
(dlrs 201 billion) stimulus package in an attempt to lift the
country out of its worst recession since World War II.
	   Miyazawa also ruled out more steps to boost Japan's economy in
response to the decision Thursday by European Union governments to
slash interest rates.
	   All countries adopting a single European currency next year cut
their key official interest rates to 3.0 percent, except for Italy,
whose discount rate remained at 3.50 percent.
	   The troubles afflicting the world's second-largest economy have
stifled domestic demand, and many business are being starved for
cash as debt-ridden banks scale back on lending.

Chinese gymnast pulls out of Asian Games with injury
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK (AP) _ China's gymnastics team suffered a blow Friday
when team member Lu Yufu pulled out of the Asian Games after
injuring his knee in practice, a team member said.
	   Lu, 20, tore a knee ligament in practice Thursday. Lu, a member
of China's 1997 world champion team, will be replaced by Zhao
Sheng, said his teammate, Wang Tongji.
	   In international competition, Lu won three gold medals in team,
floor exercise and pommel horse at the East Asian Games last year.

 &UR; Norman, Couples sneak into third round &QL; 
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES throughout with end of play Friday &QL; 
 &UR; By DENNIS PASSA
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Australian Paul Gow shot a
2-under-par 70 Friday to take a one-shot lead into the third round
of the Australian Open golf tournament as big-name players scraped
into weekend play.
	   Presidents Cup competitors Greg Norman and Fred Couples were
nearly spectators for the final two rounds after blustery
conditions at Royal Adelaide sent scores soaring.
	   Norman, playing his first 72-hole tournament since coming back
from shoulder surgery, shot a 10-over-par 82 Friday while Couples,
who clinched the trophy for the United States in a win over Vijay
Singh in the last Presidents Cup two years ago, shot a second
consecutive 76.
	   ``It's tough out there,'' Gow said. ``You've just got to be
patient and try to keep those doubles and triples (bogeys) off the
card.''
	   Rodney Pampling of Australia was a shot back of Gow after a 71
Friday, while countryman Peter Senior shot a 73 to be on 143, two
shots back.
	   Gow, Pampling and Senior are the only players in the original
126-man field who are under par. Australian Greg Chalmers is all
alone in fourth after a 73 for a two-round total of even-par 144.
	   First-round leader Stuart Appleby of Australia also fell victim
to the course, shooting a 76 Friday to be on 1-over par with five
other golfers, four back of the lead.
	   Norman and Couples, who will both play at Royal Melbourne in the
Presidents Cup beginning next week, finished with two-round totals
of 152 _ right on the 8-over cut.
	   ``I didn't have control of the elements today,'' Norman said.
``I lost it and didn't get it back.''
	   Norman joked that he might be ``benched'' by Presidents Cup
International team captain Peter Thomson, who was also responsible
for redesigning Royal Adelaide with extra bunkers, longer tees,
tighter fairways and thicker rough.
	   ``Perhaps Thomson will look at my 82 and put me out to
pasture,'' said Norman, who said his shoulder is not bothering him.
	   Couples double-bogeyed the 14th and 15th holes on Friday and
never looked in touch. His Presidents Cup teammate John Huston also
snuck in to weekend play, scoring 151 after two rounds, including a
76 Friday.
	   England's Justin Rose, bidding to make his first cut in his
ninth attempt at a professional tournament, shot an 81 _ including
a double-bogey 6 on the 18th, to finish at 153, one away from
qualifying.
	   As an amateur, Rose finished tied for fourth in this year's
British Open.
	   Countryman Nick Faldo, taking advice from Australian golf legend
Norman Von Nida, overcame his first-round troubles to shoot a
3-under-par 69, the best of the day. Faldo had an early start and
finished his round before the wind picked up.
	   Faldo, following up a disappointing 77 on Thursday, was 2-under
after the front nine that included a run of consecutive birdies on
the sixth, seventh and eighth holes.
	   After his Thursday round, Faldo said he was given some advice by
Von Nida, who won the Australian Open in 1950, 1952 and 1953,
	   ``I practiced last night and it was like a new day today,''
Faldo said.
	   Faldo bogeyed the toughest hole at Royal Adelaide _ the par-4
15th _ for his only blemish on the back nine, then finished with
birdies on 17 and 18.

Thais clear U.S. man, Pakistanis of terrorist allegations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Police in the northern Thai city of
Chiang Mai on Friday denied media reports that an arrested American
was suspected of plotting to bomb the U.S. Embassy.
	   Thai police are on high alert for the two-week Asian Games that
open Sunday.
	   They have also tightened security around the U.S. Embassy, which
closed for a day last month in connection with a general warning to
U.S. diplomatic postings to be on alert for terror attacks.
	   Two days ago, Thai police had to retract terrorism allegations
against four Pakistani men when material seized at their rented
house on suspicion they were trying to make bombs turned out to be
old junk.
	   The Thai television network ITV reported Friday that Ted Butler
Alsud, 47, a writer from Mississippi, was arrested Thursday on
suspicion of plotting to bomb the U.S. Embassy.
	   The arrest came after his landlord complained he was behaving
bizarrely and brandishing a sword.
	   Lt. Jonjul Laithaisong of the Chiang Mai police said the reports
were misleading. Alsud had neither bomb materials nor arms, only
the shells, some of which were duds.
	   Alsud claimed he was keeping them as souvenirs. He remained in
custody and could face a fine for illegally possessing them.
	   Meanwhile, Pakistani Ambassador Sher Afghan Khan eased up his
previously scathing criticism of the Thai police for the mistaken
arrest of the four Pakistanis.
	   The four remained in custody Friday, three days after they were
arrested by Immigration Police in Bangkok and charged with
possessing bomb-making materials.
	   One of the men was beaten and the Pakistani Embassy accused
police Thursday of trying to coerce confessions.
	   The embassy accused the police if targeting Pakistanis whenever
there is a terrorist scare.
	   The four are still in jail and were cited by The Nation
newspaper Friday as saying they wanted to sue the police.
	   Police said that since charges have been filed, the men must go
through due judicial process before being freed.
	   Ambassador Sher Afghan Khan told The Associated Press that he
was satisfied with the way police were handling the case and that
relations between the two countries were not strained.
	   ``My understanding is that one of the Pakistanis has been beaten
up, but the attacker has not been identified,'' Sher Afghan Khan
said. ``I'm sure the Thai police will take the appropriate
action.''

Israeli warplanes raid guerrilla bases in South Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes bombed suspected
guerrilla bases in South Lebanon Friday for the second day,
Lebanese security officials said.
	   They said the jets fired at least two air-to-surface missiles in
two sorties on a valley between the villages of Habboush and Arab
Salim, five kilometers (three miles) north of this southern market
town.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the morning
attack.
	   The targeted area is believed to be used by Hezbollah guerrillas
to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their allied Lebanese
militiamen in an Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon.
	   Israeli warplanes on Thursday also attacked suspected guerrilla
bases after mortar and rocket attacks on Israeli outposts in the
occupied enclave. There were no casualties from the Hezbollah
attack or the Israeli raid.
	   Israeli warplanes have attacked suspected Hezbollah bases in the
south almost daily since Nov. 8.
	   Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas have been waging a guerrilla
war to oust an estimated 1,500 Israeli soldiers and their 2,500
allied militiamen from the zone that Israel set up in 1985 to
protect its northern territory from guerrilla attacks.
	   Seven Israeli soldiers were killed in bomb attacks by Hezbollah
guerrillas last month, sparking an intense rethinking in the
Israeli government about its Lebanon policy

Ice hockey player Silver died of heart attack, autopsy says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Canadian-Swiss ice hockey player Chad
Silver, who was found dead in his bed, died of a heart attack,
according to autopsy results released Friday.
	   Christina Achour, spokeswoman for Zurich police, said the
autopsy ruled out a connection between Silver's death and any
injury suffered Tuesday in his last game for the Zurich-based ZSC
lions.
	   He played to the end of the game against Davos although Swiss
television has replayed footage showing his head hitting the ice
hard after a collision.
	   Beat Villiger, Davos team physician, told the Zurich station
Radio Z on Friday that the pathologist had looked for a blood clot
in the brain, but found nothing.
	   The body of Silver, 29, was found in his Zurich apartment
Thursday after he failed to report for practice.
	   Investigating Judge Daniel Regenmass said there was no
indication of violence. Simon Schenk, club sports director, said
Silver took no drugs and a recent doping test on the player was
negative.
	   Villiger said tests are being conducted on blood and tissue
samples to determine whether doping or drugs were involved, but
that it would take about 10 days to know the results.
	   Investigators, however, found nothing in Silver's flat that
would indicate he had been using any prohibited substances, he
added.
	   Villiger said a recent increase in deaths of hockey players
could be attributed more to congenital and acquired heart problems
than to the sport.
	   But he said that because of the trend, the Swiss Association of
Sports Physicians had developed an examination program. Silver
underwent the checkup two weeks ago, but nothing unusual was
detected, he added.

Israeli warplanes raid guerrilla bases in South Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes bombed suspected
guerrilla bases in South Lebanon Friday for the second day,
Lebanese security officials said.
	   They said the jets fired at least two air-to-surface missiles in
two sorties on a valley between the villages of Habboush and Arab
Salim, five kilometers (three miles) north of this southern market
town.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the morning
attack.
	   The targeted area is believed to be used by Hezbollah guerrillas
to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their allied Lebanese
militiamen in an Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon.
	   Israeli warplanes on Thursday also attacked suspected guerrilla
bases after mortar and rocket attacks on Israeli outposts in the
occupied enclave. There were no casualties from the Hezbollah
attack or the Israeli raid.
	   Israeli warplanes have attacked suspected Hezbollah bases in the
south almost daily since Nov. 8.
	   Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas have been waging a guerrilla
war to oust an estimated 1,500 Israeli soldiers and their 2,500
allied militiamen from the zone that Israel set up in 1985 to
protect its northern territory from guerrilla attacks.
	   Seven Israeli soldiers were killed in bomb attacks by Hezbollah
guerrillas last month, sparking an intense rethinking in the
Israeli government about its Lebanon policy.

Internal measures needed to halt Indonesia's economic crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED until 1300 GMT Friday, time set by source &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Indonesia will have to be more even-handed about
handing out subsidies if it is to come out of the worst recession
for 25 years, the World Trade Organization said Friday.
	   But it warned that even then the economic recovery will take
time and living standards for Indonesians will not return to their
pre-crisis levels before the early years of the next century.
	   ``Before the crisis is over, a substantial proportion of
Indonesia's population will have slipped back below the poverty
line,'' the organization's trade policy review adds.
	   The report documents the massive turnaround in fortunes which
Indonesia has undergone in the past two years.
	   Until 1996 the country's economy had been growing steadily, with
gross domestic product rising on average by 8 percent each year.
But in the first half of 1998 GDP fell by 12 percent.
	   Inflation has risen from an average of 10 percent in the years
of high growth to an expected rate of 80-100 percent by the end of
1998, and the country is in the worst recession since 1963,
according to the WTO.
	   The report accepts that large subsidies are still necessary to
stabilize prices of essential foodstuffs, but believes that changes
can be made.
	   ``The restoration of confidence in the Indonesian economy will
entail the establishment of more rules-based, competition-oriented
internal policies,'' the report says, while noting that Indonesia
has already made progress in deregulating internal trade and
removing trade barriers.
	   It suggests that the government could strengthen the competition
framework, introduce greater transparency on government loans and
subsidies and enforce laws and regulations in the area of
government procurement.
	   ``The success of these reforms in fostering Indonesia's eventual
economic recovery depends crucially on a pick-up in exports, which
itself relies heavily on the maintenance of a stable, predictable
and open international trading system,'' the report adds.
	   The causes of the financial and currency turmoil are ``multiple
and complex,'' according to the 146-page report.
	   ``External factors, such as the withdrawal of international
investors from Asia ... were compounded by internal developments,
particularly growing uncertainty about economic, social and
political stability in Indonesia,'' it said.

Investigators still unsure how fatal fire started

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Investigators said Friday they have
yet to find what caused the fire that razed an aging orphanage,
killing at least 25 children and five adults.
	   Several infants were among those killed in the pre-dawn fire
Thursday at the Settlement House built 85 years ago and run by a
women's organization in Manila's Paco district.
	   ``We are still checking the cause of the fire, but we have
already identified where the fire started,'' said Pablito Cordeta,
operations chief of the Manila fire department.
	   Cordeta said the fire originated from the library on the second
floor of the front wing of the mostly wooden building.
	   Investigators Thursday said faulty electrical wiring may have
set off the fire.
	   ``We have stopped looking for casualties. I believe we have
already gone through what was left of the orphanage several times
and we have not found any more human remains,'' Cordeta said.
	   The orphanage also took care of children of unwed mothers and
children of working parents in the slum neighborhood.
	   Evelyn Lontok, a social work specialist with the Department of
Social Welfare and Development, said staffers who survived told
authorities there were 49 children and 19 adults inside the
orphanage at the time of the blaze.
	   There were initial reports that five children were missing, but
they were were later found reunited with relatives, she said.
	   Children, including toddlers, shouted for help from the
second-floor windows, which were covered with metal grills to
protect against intruders, but neighbors were unable to open the
padlocked main gate to get to them.
	   The children had been looking forward to a Christmas party
Friday.
	   Relatives of those who died said Friday they were considering a
mass burial for those who have not been identified because they
were severely burned.
	   Juan Agravante who had slept overnight at the orphanage while
visiting his wife, Maria Theresa, a baby sitter at the orphanage,
was also killed in the fire.
	   Their bodies were found in each other's arms, hugging their two
sons, John Andrian, 8, and Jomari, 2.
	   Ederlina Mobreros, who works as a maid in northern Baguio City,
and mother of 5-year-old Maybeline who died in the fire, was
bitter.
	   She said she was told that her daughter had been abandoned along
with two other children who could not be roused from their sleep by
one of the staff who saved nine others.
	   ``Why was my daughter abandoned. They could have tossed her out
through the fire exit. She could have been hurt but she would still
be alive,'' she said, tears welling in her bloodshot eyes.
	   Fire officials said they received a call about the blaze around
2 a.m., more than an hour after witnesses saw the first signs of
the blaze.
	   They said about 70 percent of the orphanage was already burning
when they arrived a few minutes after the call.
	   There were no telephones in the immediate vicinity and orphanage
staffers said the room where the telephone was located had been
engulfed in flames.
	   President Joseph Estrada visited the gutted buildings Thursday
afternoon and pledged to help the orphanage recover.
	   ``I will raise funds personally. I will do everything I can to
rebuild this place,'' he said.
	   Ms. Lontok of the social welfare department said the surviving
children aged 1-1/2 years to 13 years will undergo therapy.
	   ``That experience is really traumatic and they will always
remember if not recall the horrible experience,'' she said.
	   Faulty equipment or lax enforcement of fire regulations are
responsible for many deadly fires in the Philippines.
	   In May 1998, a fire at the Lung Center of the Philippines in
suburban Quezon City killed 25 people and devastated the
government-run hospital. Two years earlier, a fire at the Ozone
Disco in the same suburb killed 162 people.

Russian inflation to top 70 percent this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Inflation has gone up more than 65 percent so far
this year and is expected to top 70 percent by the end of the year,
the government said Friday.
	   Russian inflation had been coming down after years of soaring
prices and was expected to be in single digits this year until the
country's economic crisis hit in August.
	   Prices skyrocketed in August and September, but have begun to
level off in recent months.
	   Inflation was up 65.3 percent for the first 11 months of this
year, the State Statistics Committee said Friday, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   Inflation has been running at about 5 percent a month for the
past two months, and the final figure for the year is expected to
be a bit over 70 percent.
	   The government is urgently seeking foreign assistance to help
ease its cash shortage. But no assistance is likely in the near
future, and the government has warned that it may have to begin
printing money, which could lead to a new round of uncontrolled
inflation.
	   Russia suffered from hyperinflation in the early 1990s, but the
rate was down to 11 percent last year.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Hundreds of lawyers, many in black
robes, marched to a courthouse Friday in solidarity for an attorney
who faces three months imprisonment for contempt of court in the
trial of politician Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Several dozen pro-Anwar activists joined the lawyers as they
shouted, ``We want justice,'' in front of the federal courthouse.
	   At the courthouse, Zainur Zakaria won a temporary reprieve when
a three-judge bench held off on his imprisonment until his appeal
could be heard. No date was set for the appeal.
	   When Zainur emerged from the courtroom, the lawyers clapped and
cheered.
	   Had Zainur been sent to jail, it would be the first time in
Malaysia that a lawyer was imprisoned for such a long period for
contempt while defending a client. Previous such sentences have
been a day or two in jail.
	   Zainur was sentenced Monday after he refused to apologize for
accusing two prosecutors in Anwar's trial of trying to get a
potential witness to lie.
	   Zainur's attorney, Raja Aziz Addruse, criticized the sentencing
by Judge Augustine Paul as too harsh, calling it ``irregular.''
	   Anwar, who denies wrongdoing, is being tried on four counts of
abuse of power. He will be tried later on another charge of
corruption and five charges of committing illegal sex acts.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar as deputy prime
minister on Sept. 2, saying he had determined his former protege
was too immoral to rule.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, prompting protests, both at home
and abroad.
	   The judge in Anwar's trial has said the allegations Zainur filed
in an affidavit were insulting to the prosecutors.
	   In the affidavit, two prosecutors were accused of trying to
cajole a potential witness into fabricating evidence of sex crimes
allegedly by Anwar.
	   It demanded the court remove senior government prosecutors Abdul
Gani Patail and Azahar Mohamed.

Troops block students near Indonesia's presidential palace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 300 student protesters defied
warnings from the military and staged a noisy street rally near
Indonesia's presidential palace Friday.
	   Squads of troops and armored personnel carriers blocked the
students, many wearing brightly colored jackets, when they marched
to a busy intersection only a few hundred meters (yards) from the
palace complex near Jakarta's Chinatown.
	   They chanted anti-government slogans and called on the
government to accelerate and extend a push for greater democracy.
Some handed flowers to soldiers.
	   The students also demanded that former authoritarian President
Suharto be put on trial on corruption charges.
	   Friday's demonstration is the latest in a series of almost daily
protests against President B.J. Habibie who announced Thursday that
parliamentary elections will be held on June 7.
	   Indonesia's highest legislative body, the People's Consultative
Assembly, is to convene in August to select a new head of state.
	   Habibie has also promised to step up an ongoing investigation
into Suharto's wealth after abandoning a plan to set up a
commission of inquiry into the old leader's affairs.
	   On Wednesday, more than 1,500 students broke through what should
have been a tight security cordon and got to within a few meters
(yards) of the ornate white-columned palace.
	   The military has warned students not to attempt more protests
near the Dutch-built colonial mansion.
	   ``Demonstrations around the palace are illegal,'' said Maj. Gen.
Suwandi, who is in charge of palace security.
	   On Nov. 13, soldiers shot nine students dead when they tried to
march on Parliament.

Antiaircraft missile accidentally fired

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ An antiaircraft missile was
accidentally fired into busy commercial airspace over the western
city of Inchon on Friday, injuring three people, officials said.
	   Those injured suffered minor cuts on their heads and hands by
tiny metal fragments from the missile that exploded in the air,
police said.
	   About 20 cars were also damaged by the fragments, police said.
The explosion started brush fires in nearby hills but they were
quickly put out.
	   Defense Ministry officials said they were unsure whether the
Nike-Hercules missile was accidentally fired by a soldier or
whether the 33-year-old system had malfunctioned.
	   The missile was automatically destroyed by a built-in safety
device seconds after it left the launcher, sending a shower of
hundreds of metal fragments over a nearby residential area, they
said.
	   One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
missile was believed to have been destroyed before it reached a
height of 500 meters (1,650 feet).
	   Virtually all of the some 250 passenger and cargo planes that
use Seoul's Kimpo International Airport daily pass through the
airspace over Inchon, according to aviation authorities.
	   ``When the planes fly over Inchon, they are at least 4,000 feet
above ground and at least five to 10 miles apart. I would not
speculate what could have happened if the missile had not been
destroyed so quickly,'' said Kim Dong-jin, an official at the Seoul
District Air Traffic Control Center.
	   Kim said his office could not say how many commercial airplanes
were flying over Inchon at the time of the missile launch and were
in possible danger until it received more data from the military.
	   But the national Yonhap news agency reported that at least four
commercial planes, including a Singapore Air passenger jet, were
over Inchon around the time the missile was fired.
	   Inchon is about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the heavily
guarded border with communist North Korea.
	   The two Koreas are technically at war, with no peace treaty
signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's economic crisis and its rapidly aging
society have necessitated urgent reforms of wage, pension and
nursing systems to ensure the welfare of older citizens, the
government said Friday.
	   People in their 40s and 50s are increasingly frightened of
losing their jobs and of not receiving care when they join the
ballooning ranks of the elderly, the Economic Planning Agency said
in its white paper released Friday.
	   ``Concerns about the health of parents and children, coupled
with the current economic crisis and job uncertainty have led to
deep anxiety among middle-aged people,'' said the report called
``The Fears and Hopes of the Middle-Aged.''
	   The agency estimates the population of people over 65 will reach
31.88 million by 2015, or 25.2 percent of the overall population.
	   Japan's plummeting birthrate has prompted fears that there will
soon be a lack of young workers to support Japan's senior citizens.
	   The report recommended that corporate Japan dismantle its
seniority-based wage system to encourage middle-aged workers to
acquire specific skills that will enable them to find work, if they
are laid off.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hit by a prolonged economic slump, sales of
imported cars, trucks and buses in Japan tumbled 17.1 percent last
month compared to a year ago to 22,250 vehicles, a Japanese
industry association said Friday.
	   November marked the 20th month of year-on-year declines in sales
of imported vehicles, the Japan Automobile Importers Association
said.
	   Sales of foreign-made passenger cars fell 15.4 percent last
month to 21,672 units, while sales of imported trucks plunged 54.5
percent to 565 units.
	   A total of 13 imported buses were sold in November, compared
with none a year ago.
	   A spokesman for the auto importers' association blamed the poor
sales on skittish consumers who are reluctant to spend amid Japan's
worst recession since World War II.
	   According to recent data by a Japanese automakers' association,
sales of domestic vehicles in November fell 15.9 percent, also
dropping for a 20th straight month.
	   Overall sales of imported vehicles slid party due to a sharp
fall in so-called reverse imports of cars made in Japanese-owned
plants overseas. Reverse import sales in November totaled 3,023,
down 34.1 percent.
	   Sales of passenger car imports from the United States fell 24.7
percent to 5,474. General Motors Corp.'s sales dropped 25.6 percent
to 1,315, Ford Motor Co.'s sales fell 30.9 percent to 333, and
sales of cars made by Chrysler Corp., now DaimlerChrysler AG,
tumbled 60.1 percent to 477.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Inflation in the Philippines jumped
to 11.2 percent in November on a year-on-year basis, the highest
level in nearly three years, the government said Thursday.
	   The steep rise from 10.2 percent in October was attributed
largely to a sharp increase in food prices, which have a hefty
weighting in the consumer price index. Crop damage caused by
several strong typhoons helped push food prices up 12.3 percent in
November from a year earlier, compared to a 9.9 percent increase in
October.
	   The November data brought the average inflation rate for the
first 11 months of the year to 9.7 percent, still below the
government's target of 10 percent.
	   Most economists had predicted consumer prices would rise just
10.1 percent in November. The 11.2 percent inflation rate was the
highest since January 1996, when consumer prices also rose 11.2
percent on the year.
	   Inflation was 7.6 percent in November 1997.
	   The surge in inflation stoked worries of a reversal of a recent
declining trend in interest rates.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A brief power failure hit Hong Kong's business
district early Friday, but traders kept buying and selling in their
darkened dealing rooms.
	   ``Our trading floor lost lights and air conditioning, but
trading was uninterrupted,'' said Randy Gilmore, chief executive of
the Hong Kong Futures Exchange.
	   The Hong Kong Stock Exchange stayed on-line, a spokeswoman said,
though investment banks Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers were
temporarily affected.
	   Power went down for two to three minutes in parts of the
business district, known as ``Central,'' which houses most major
banks, brokerages and the two exchanges, according to Hong Kong
Electric Holdings Ltd.
	   A business tower that houses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,
the territory's de facto central bank, had its power interrupted
for about 50 minutes, the spokesman said.
	   The monetary authority's computers and lighting systems were all
operating, though the elevators stopped, a spokeswoman said.
	   When power was restored to most of the central business
district, a resulting surge cut power for a few seconds to other
customers. Lights switched off and on and computers went down and
then re-booted.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Carrying a mock coffin filled with
rolls of film, some 500 stars, directors and supporters marched in
Seoul Friday to protest U.S. demands to open South Korea's movie
market to more imports.
	   For years, South Korea has guarded its domestic movie industry
with a quota system, under which all local cinemas must screen
domestically produced films for at least 146 days a year.
	   The United States says the system constitutes an unfair trade
practice that discriminates against Hollywood. It has demanded
South Korea abolish or phase out the quota quickly.
	   ``America stop plotting to kill South Korean movies! We will
defend the screen quota to the death!'' the protesters chanted,
pumping their clenched fists into the freezing winter air.
	   Hundreds of police stood guard but did not intervene.
	   Some protesters were dressed in black and held up portraits of
movie stars to symbolize the death of the domestic movie industry.
	   Thousands of pedestrians stopped to watch the celebrities march
along the busy Myongdong commercial district in central Seoul,
carrying pickets and banners criticizing the U.S. and South Korean
governments.
	   They denounced the Seoul government as taking too weak a stand
against the United States.
	   During the latest round of trade talks in Washington in
November, South Korea proposed to cut the quota to 92 days a year,
but the United States rejected it, said officials at the Foreign
and Trade Ministry.
	   The United States reportedly is demanding that Seoul quicken the
phase-out. A fourth round of talks has been set for mid-December in
Seoul.

President vetoes law allowing partial release of secret files
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDRZEJ STYLINSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ President Aleksander Kwasniewski on Friday
vetoed a law passed by parliament that would allow victims of
communist-era repression to see their secret police files.
	   Under the law, an Institute of National Remembrance would be set
up to collect communist files from 1944-89, as well as documents of
Stalinist and Nazi crimes. The institute would make the files
available to victims of the totalitarian regimes and reveal who
informed on them.
	   Kwasniewski, a former communist, argued that a court, not the
commission, should decide who was a victim. He also wanted all
citizens to have access to the files, not just victims, according
to presidential lawyer Ryszard Kalisz.
	   The bill now goes back to parliament, where the powerful Sejm
chamber can override Kwasniewski's veto if it approves the measure
by more than a 60 percent majority.
	   Nine years after toppling communist rule, Poland still grapples
with the question of dealing with the oppressive regime that kept
secret police files on many people, especially those suspected of
anti-government activity.
	   Another bill that requires government officials, judges and
others to declare if they ever worked for or collaborated with the
former security service took effect last week. Anyone making a
false declaration can lose their job.
	   The issue of disclosing the past is divided along political
lines, with former communists now at the vanguard of the leftist
political parties saying dredging up such information will cause
problems while rightists from the anti-communist opposition push to
reveal all.
	   In particular, the rightists such as leaders of the Solidarity
movement that heads the governing alliance warn former government
agents could be controlled or blackmailed by criminal gangs or
foreign intelligence.
	   But leftists have their own warning: the files are incomplete,
with many of them destroyed, and any information in them might be
inaccurate due to the uncontrolled work of the Security Service,
which was disbanded in 1990.
	   That could cause chaos, they say, such as the ouster of the
government of Prime Minister Jan Olszewski in 1992 after a list it
compiled of alleged communist collaborators was leaked.
	   ``I have a feeling ... that there will be a lot of harm,'' said
Jozef Oleksy, an ex-communist who was forced to resign as prime
minister in 1996 under allegations put forward by the secret
service that he was a KGB informer.
	   After several months, a military prosecutor cleared Oleksy of
any wrongdoing.
	   ``The accusation is printed in big letters on front pages while
... the apology either never gets printed or it is published in a
very narrow circulation,'' he said.
	   But Solidarity founder Lech Walesa, the first post-communist
president, said the present generation must pay the price for
Poland's tragic past.
	   ``There will be victims, but you cannot settle this problem
without victims,'' he said. Enduring the controversy now would end
all speculation and ``mud slinging,'' he argued.

Tokyo market's key index falls for two straight day, dollar lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Wraps up with late dollar, closing bond, other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo share prices fell Friday for the second
straight day on worries about Wall Street and other foreign
markets. The U.S. dollar slid against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 57.11 points,
or 0.39 percent, closing the week at 14,639.97 points. On Thursday,
the index had shed 289.54 points, or 1.93 percent.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 118.32 yen, down 0.91 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level
of 118.60 yen overnight.
	   The dollar remained under selling pressure as investors were
discouraged by the continuing decline in U.S. stocks and
Wednesday's defeat in the Brazilian Congress of an important
government austerity measure.
	   The market is becoming ``very nervous about the American
economy,'' said Kazuo Takayama, chief foreign exchange manager at
Midland Bank in Tokyo.
	   In New York Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
184.86 points to 8,879.68.
	   Japanese stock prices continued to fall in thin trading on
selling of international blue chip shares.
	   Honda closed down 110 yen (93 cents) at 4,280 yen (dlrs 36.3),
while Sony dipped 110 yen (93 cents) to 8,890 yen (dlrs 75.3).
	   Many investors sat on the sidelines to wait on unsettling
developments in Brazil, and what impact a coordinated rate cut by
major European central banks Thursday will have on the global
economy.
	   Trading was moderate, with about 344 million shares changing
hands on the exchange's first section, up slightly from Thursday's
323 million shares. Declining shares outnumbered advances 803 to
355, with 142 issues unchanged.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 8.17 points, or 0.72 percent, to 1,120.72. The
TOPIX fell 18.26 points, or 1.59 percent, the previous day.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar was also weighted on by
speculation that the Federal Reserve may respond to a move by 11
European nations, which jointly lowered interest rates on Thursday,
traders said.
	   The rate-cutting was designed to combat a recent bout of
economic weakness in Europe while easing concerns in the financial
market.
	   The benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government bond fell to
1.045 percent from Thursday's close of 1.090 percent, driving its
price up to 106.54 yen from the previous day's finish of 106.13
yen.

Netanyahu defends position in talks with Albright
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu-Albright phone call; CHANGES byline &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Facing U.S. criticism, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu told U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that he
has made no new demands of the Palestinians while suspending a West
Bank pullback, his senior adviser said Friday.
	   An adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, meanwhile,
charged that Netanyahu created the latest crisis in order to
appease hard-liners and strengthen his shaky coalition.
	   Netanyahu suspended implementation of the land-for-security
agreement with the Palestinians earlier this week after complaining
that Arafat systematically violated the accord.
	   The Israeli leader said he would only be satisfied by a public
declaration by Arafat that the Palestinians are dropping plans to
declare statehood in May and that they accept Israel's criteria for
the release of Palestinian prisoners.
	   Albright spoke to Netanyahu by phone on Thursday to discuss the
latest crisis which came just little more than a week before the
arrival of U.S. President Bill Clinton in the region. Clinton is to
oversee the start of the second phase of the peace accord.
	   David Bar Illan, Netanyahu's policy adviser, said the Israeli
leader told Albright that Israel's conditions for renewing the
handover of West Bank territory to the Palestinians are not new.
	   Israel's security Cabinet had voted Wednesday to suspend
withdrawal in response to an incident near the the West Bank city
of Ramallah, where rioting Palestinians surrounded an Israeli car,
pelted it with rocks, beat the civilian driver and his soldier
passenger and burned the car after the two Israelis escaped.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin critcized the
Israeli suspension and called for implementation of the Wye River
accord as signed.
	   Bar-Illan said Rubin spoke before Netanyahu talked to Albright.
	   ``I think the main misunderstanding was that the Cabinet
decision was interpreted as new conditions,'' said Bar Illan. ``The
prime minister explained that (he was insisting) on compliance with
commitments made as long as five years ago.''
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon was to leave this weekend
for meetings with Albright and senior Clinton administration
officials. The first item on the agenda will be the latest crisis
with the Palestinians, said Sharon spokesman Raanan Gissin.
	   Sharon will also raise his ideas for a permanent peace agreement
with the Palestinians. Such an accord would have to set final
borders and determine the status of Jerusalem.
	   Sharon reportedly hopes to postpone the May 1999 deadline for
reaching agreement, and compensate the Palestinians by granting
them near-independence in the areas they already control.
	   Final status negotiations were formally launched last month, but
the real work has not yet begun.
	   Clinton will discuss final status proposals separately with
Netanyahu and Arafat when he arrives in the region Dec. 12 in what
would be the first serious deliberations on the subject, the
Haaretz daily said.
	   Netanyahu charged that since the Wye River agreement was signed
at the White house Oct. 23, ``we have seen a constant attempt by
the Palestinians to erode the agreement, to ignore the agreement,
or to violate it flagrantly.''
	   Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi, however, said Netanyahu triggered the
crisis to keep his shaky ruling coalition together. After the
Cabinet suspended implementation of the Wye River accord, the
hard-line National Religious Party announced it would withdraw its
support for a bill to dissolve the parliament and call elections.
	   ``The future of the peace process is very much in danger and we
are anticipating that the American administration will intervene
actively,'' Tibi said.

Hymn orders cancelled
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Officials have rescinded controversial
orders that students at state-run schools in northern India start
the day with a Hindu hymn and a salute to the motherland, a local
news agency reported Friday.
	   Press Trust of India said the Uttar Pradesh education ministry
issued a statement Friday saying the orders by Primary Education
Minister Ravindra Kumar Shukla in October were canceled because
they were improperly issued. The statement did not elaborate.
	   Muslim leaders had advised parents to withdraw their children
from state schools rather than let them be forced to sing a hymn to
Saraswati, the Hindu goddess of learning. They also objected that
singing Vande Mataram _ ``Hail to the Motherland'' _ a traditional
song popularized during India's independence movement _ amounted to
worshipping India, when Muslims worshipped only Allah.
	   Shukla said Muslim students had the option to remain silent
during the singing, but that did not quell protests.
	   Shukla's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, in power in
Uttar Pradesh as well as at the federal level, has been accused of
fanning religious tension in India. The country is 80 percent Hindu
and 12 percent Muslim.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Investigators said Friday they have
yet to find what caused the fire that razed an aging orphanage,
killing at least 25 children and five adults.
	   Several infants were among those killed in the pre-dawn fire
Thursday at the Settlement House built 85 years ago and run by a
women's organization in Manila's Paco district.
	   ``We are still checking the cause of the fire, but we have
already identified where the fire started,'' said Pablito Cordeta,
operations chief of the Manila fire department.
	   Cordeta said the fire originated from the library on the second
floor of the front wing of the mostly wooden building.
	   Investigators Thursday said faulty electrical wiring may have
set off the fire.
	   ``We have stopped looking for casualties. I believe we have
already gone through what was left of the orphanage several times
and we have not found any more human remains,'' Cordeta said.
	   The orphanage also took care of children of unwed mothers and
children of working parents in the slum neighborhood.
	   Evelyn Lontok, a social work specialist with the Department of
Social Welfare and Development, said staffers who survived told
authorities there were 49 children and 19 adults inside the
orphanage at the time of the blaze.
	   There were initial reports that five children were missing, but
they were were later found reunited with relatives, she said.
	   Children, including toddlers, shouted for help from the
second-floor windows, which were covered with metal grills to
protect against intruders, but neighbors were unable to open the
padlocked main gate to get to them.
	   The children had been looking forward to a Christmas party
Friday.
	   Pope John Paul II said he was deeply saddened and promised to
pray for the victims and the survivors, according to Cardinal
Angelo Sodano, the Vatican secretary of state.
	   Jaime Cardinal Sin, the Archbishop of Manila, called for
prayers.
	   ``It is indeed difficult to comprehend with our limited minds
the meaning of such tragedy,'' Sin said in a statement.
	   Relatives of those who died said Friday they were considering a
mass burial for those who have not been identified because they
were severely burned.
	   Juan Agravante, a real estate salesman, was also killed in the
fire. He had been visiting his wife, Maria Theresa, a baby-sitter
at the orphanage.
	   Their bodies were found in each other's arms, hugging their two
sons, John Andrian, 8, and Jomari, 2.
	   Ederlina Mobreros, who works as a maid in northern Baguio City,
and mother of 5-year-old Maybeline who died in the fire, was
bitter.
	   She said she was told that her daughter had been abandoned along
with two other children who could not be roused from their sleep by
one of the staff who saved nine others.
	   ``Why was my daughter abandoned. They could have tossed her out
through the fire exit. She could have been hurt but she would still
be alive,'' she said, tears welling in her bloodshot eyes.
	   Fire officials said they received a call about the blaze around
2 a.m., more than an hour after witnesses saw the first signs of
the blaze.
	   They said about 70 percent of the orphanage was already burning
when they arrived a few minutes after the call.
	   There were no telephones in the immediate vicinity and orphanage
staffers said the room where the telephone was located had been
engulfed in flames.
	   President Joseph Estrada visited the gutted buildings Thursday
afternoon and pledged to help the orphanage recover.
	   ``I will raise funds personally. I will do everything I can to
rebuild this place,'' he said.
	   Ms. Lontok of the social welfare department said the surviving
children aged 1-1/2 years to 13 years will undergo therapy.
	   ``That experience is really traumatic and they will always
remember if not recall the horrible experience,'' she said.
	   Faulty equipment or lax enforcement of fire regulations are
responsible for many deadly fires in the Philippines.
	   In May 1998, a fire at the Lung Center of the Philippines in
suburban Quezon City killed 25 people and devastated the
government-run hospital. Two years earlier, a fire at the Ozone
Disco in the same suburb killed 162 people.

Report: Indonesia's attorney general to question Suharto next week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Government investigators plan to
question former President Suharto next week over corruption
allegations, the official Antara news agency reported Friday.
	   ``We will question the former president at the Attorney
General's Office,'' Antara quoted Attorney General Andi Mohamad
Ghalib as saying.
	   Antara said Ghalib did not specify the date of the questioning
but stressed the investigation into Suharto's wealth would be based
on a presumption of innocence.
	   On Thursday, President B.J. Habibie ordered Ghalib to question
his predecessor, Suharto, immediately over claims that the old
leader abused his power and acted corruptly to amass a fortune for
himself, his family and a clique of cronies during his 32 years in
power.
	   Suharto, who quit after riots and protests in May, has denied
any wrongdoing.
	   Ghalib has questioned Suharto before but an earlier
investigation failed to find any evidence against the former
president.
	   Critics have accused Ghalib, a serving army general, of going
soft on Suharto, and had criticized the investigation as a
whitewash.
	   Forbes magazine this year estimated Suharto's wealth at dlrs 4
billion. Others say the figure is higher.
	   Student protesters have taken to the streets almost daily
demanding that Suharto be tried.
	   Habibie, meanwhile, abandoned plans for an independent
corruption inquiry of Suharto.
	   The government had trouble finding public figures who were
willing to join the panel, which was viewed as only a cosmetic
gesture to appease student activists.

Sri Lanka wants umpire Hair punished even after stepping aside
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY NIRESH ELIATAMBY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka is urging cricket's
governing body to discipline Australian umpire Darrel Hair for
remarks against Sri Lankan players, despite Hair's withdrawal from
officiating next month's tour Down Under.
	   ``We don't want to comment on his decision to stand down from
the upcoming series since it is a matter for the Australian board.
But our protest over his conduct stands,'' said Dammika Ranatunge,
Chief Executive of the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka.
	   Sri Lanka complained to the International Cricket Committee last
month that Hair breached the code of conduct which bars players,
team officials and umpires from making comments detrimental to the
game, or a tour they are involved in.
	   Hair, Australia's leading umpire, on Thursday withdrew from the
Sri Lankan games during a limited-overs tournament in Australia
starting in January, which also features England, ``in the
interests of harmony.''
	   But he was unrepentant about remarks against Sri Lankan bowling
ace Muttiah Muralitharan he made in his recently published
autobiography.
	   Hair no-balled off-spinner Muralitharan seven times for throwing
in a Test at Melbourne in 1995. But the ICC later accepted medical
and video evidence from the Sri Lankan board which proved
Muralitharan has a birth defect preventing him from straightening
his arm, as Hair said he did.
	   Muralitharan returned the fifth best bowling figures in Test
cricket, taking 16 wickets in a Test against England at the London
Oval in August.
	   Muralitharan, 26, is the leading bowler in international cricket
this year with 68 wickets. He has played 42 tests and is the first
Sri Lankan and 24th in the world to claim 200 Test wickets.
	   Hair rekindled the Muralitharan controversy in his book,
Decision Maker, writing that he ``could have called him 27 times or
even more.''
	   Australian Cricket Board Chairman Denis Rogers said Thursday
that Hair's comments about contemporary players who will be touring
Australia soon were not conducive to harmonious relations as he is
a serving umpire.

Netanyahu defends position in talks with Albright
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu-Albright phone call; CHANGES byline. No
pick up &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Facing U.S. criticism, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu told U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that he
has made no new demands of the Palestinians while suspending a West
Bank pullback, his senior adviser said Friday.
	   An adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, meanwhile,
charged that Netanyahu created the latest crisis in order to
appease hard-liners and strengthen his shaky coalition.
	   Netanyahu suspended implementation of the land-for-security
agreement with the Palestinians earlier this week after complaining
that Arafat systematically violated the accord.
	   The Israeli leader said he would only be satisfied by a public
declaration by Arafat that the Palestinians are dropping plans to
declare statehood in May and that they accept Israel's criteria for
the release of Palestinian prisoners.
	   Albright spoke to Netanyahu by phone on Thursday to discuss the
latest crisis which came just little more than a week before the
arrival of U.S. President Bill Clinton to the region. Clinton is to
oversee the start of the second phase of the peace accord.
	   David Bar Illan, Netanyahu's policy adviser, said the Israeli
leader told Albright that Israel's conditions for renewing the
handover of West Bank territory to the Palestinians are not new.
	   Israel's security Cabinet had voted Wednesday to suspend
withdrawal in response to an incident near the West Bank city of
Ramallah, where rioting Palestinians surrounded an Israeli car,
pelted it with rocks, beat the civilian driver and his soldier
passenger and burned the car after the two Israelis escaped.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin criticized the
Israeli suspension and called for implementation of the Wye River
accord as signed.
	   Bar-Illan said Rubin spoke before Netanyahu talked to Albright.
	   ``I think the main misunderstanding was that the Cabinet
decision was interpreted as new conditions,'' said Bar Illan. ``The
prime minister explained that (he was insisting) on compliance with
commitments made as long as five years ago.''
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon was to leave this weekend
for meetings with Albright and senior Clinton administration
officials. The first item on the agenda will be the latest crisis
with the Palestinians, said Sharon spokesman Raanan Gissin.
	   Sharon will also raise his ideas for a permanent peace agreement
with the Palestinians. Such an accord would have to set final
borders and determine the status of Jerusalem.
	   Sharon reportedly hopes to postpone the May 1999 deadline for
reaching agreement, and compensate the Palestinians by granting
them near-independence in the areas they already control.
	   Final status negotiations were formally launched last month, but
the real work has not yet begun.
	   Clinton will discuss final status proposals separately with
Netanyahu and Arafat when he arrives in the region Dec. 12 in what
would be the first serious deliberations on the subject, the
Haaretz daily said.
	   Netanyahu charged that since the Wye River agreement was signed
at the White house Oct. 23, ``we have seen a constant attempt by
the Palestinians to erode the agreement, to ignore the agreement,
or to violate it flagrantly.''
	   Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi, however, said Netanyahu triggered the
crisis to keep his shaky ruling coalition together. After the
Cabinet suspended implementation of the Wye River accord, the
hard-line National Religious Party announced it would withdraw its
support for a bill to dissolve the parliament and call elections.
	   ``The future of the peace process is very much in danger and we
are anticipating that the American administration will intervene
actively,'' Tibi said.

Tiny mementos lost forever in storm's devastation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEN GUGGENHEIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras (AP) _ When the photograph was taken,
Otilia Campos was already dying of tuberculosis. But to her
daughter, she still looked young, and the beauty of her dark eyes
hadn't faded.
	   Josefina Campos treasured that picture of her mother. She kept
it in her bedroom, on top of a metal box used to store clothing
until Hurricane Mitch washed away her home and everything she
owned.
	   Of all the possessions taken away from her, there's nothing that
pains her more than losing that photo, the last taken of her mother
before she died 12 years ago at age 52.
	   ``It was the best keepsake I had of my mother,'' Campos said.
	   Hurricane Mitch killed thousands and left more than 1 million
people homeless when it hit at the end of October. Talk to
survivors and almost without exception they'll stress that material
items don't mean much; the most important thing is that their
families are safe. They worry more about rebuilding their lives
than about any single item.
	   Yet for some, weeks after the storm, the pain is deepened by the
loss of that one special item that meant so much to them.
	   It could be a photograph of a mother, a gift from a dear friend,
or a child's favorite toy. Or for the many poor people, it's that
one item for which they had worked so hard for so long to buy _ and
which they doubt they'll ever be able to replace.
	   For Enrique Avila Garcia, it was a clock.
	   Two years ago, a young American woman named Sonya came to his
town near the northern city of San Pedro Sula and trained him and
34 other people in basic health care.
	   He became friends with her and before she left, she gave him a
wall clock from the United States. He proudly displayed it in his
living room along with a framed photograph of the class of
trainees.
	   ``More than anything, it was with affection and appreciation
that she gave it to me, as a memento,'' he said.
	   He said he has lost contact with Sonya and there's no way to
tell her that he, his wife and nine children lost just about
everything they owned.
	   Adan Buezo Duarte, who was sharing a giant tent with Avila's
family at a shelter, talked about a cassette-radio lost when his
apartment was destroyed.
	   Buezo's best friend gave to it to him as a surprise present on
his 39th birthday.
	   He used it to listen to evangelical music, but now has no hope
of replacing it.
	   ``I can't earn enough money to buy another tape recorder,'' he
said.
	   For children, the flood often carried away their favorite toys.
Seven-year-old Carlitos Iscano lost his little yellow truck.
Nine-year-old Vanessa Rosano lost the pink bicycle her father
bought her last year that she rode to school and her grandmother's
house.
	   For some adults, the most important things they lost are items
that could be replaced if they had the money _ but they don't.
	   Jose Armando Molina lost his livelihood: the horse wagon he used
for things like selling vegetables. He said it would cost him dlrs
300 to buy another one.
	   Maritza Reyes, a single mother with three children, wonders how
she'll replace her stove and kitchenware. She has no money and no
job.
	   Eustagio Torres doesn't know if he'll ever be able to replace
the two brand-new full-size beds he bought recently. The beds cost
him dlrs 185 _ the equivalent of what he makes in two months
selling auto parts on the street.
	   Three of his children slept in one bed; his wife, his youngest
child and he in the other. A fifth child slept in a hammock.
	   He remembered how happy they were when he bought them.
	   ``After sleeping in small beds, to have a good bed _ that's
something special for you,'' he said.

Zimbabwe's Congo campaign spawns anger, donor concern
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANGUS SHAW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ For Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
deploying troops to the rain forests of Congo promised to boost his
standing at home and abroad, but the decision has brought little
more than criticism and suspicion.
	   More than 8,000 Zimbabwean troops are supporting embattled
Congolese President Laurent Kabila in his war against a rebel
movement backed by Rwanda and Uganda. The troops have been joined
by smaller forces from Angola, Namibia and Sudan since the
insurrection began Aug. 2.
	   But while Kabila is thankful for the help from Mugabe, his
closest ally, Zimbabweans have been less than pleased with their
president's foreign adventure.
	   Labor groups, church leaders and human rights organizations have
demanded Mugabe pull out of Congo and accuse him of trying to shore
up his flagging popularity by becoming a regional power broker.
	   But the move has done little to reverse his standing following
civil unrest earlier this year. Food riots in January forced Mugabe
to deploy troops in Zimbabwean cities for the first time since he
became the nation's first black ruler in 1980.
	   The government's continual reluctance to release information
about the situation in Congo also has raised concern at the
International Monetary Fund, which was expected to deliver dlrs 55
million in aid this month.
	   The IMF wants a breakdown of military spending before the money
is released and independent economist John Robertson fears it will
be withheld, worsening the nation's already dramatic economic
problems. The Zimbabwean dollar has plunged 80 percent in value
against the U.S. dollar in 1998 alone.
	   ``We could then expect serious social consequences,'' Robertson
said.
	   But while the nation's economic woes may be worsening, reports
indicate that some of Mugabe's political allies may be profiting
from the intervention.
	   Since the troops were deployed, Zimbabwean politicians, military
officers, business leaders and one of Mugabe's relatives have
reportedly taken large stakes in key Congolese industries,
including the mineral company Gecamines. The mining company has the
potential to be Africa's most lucrative enterprise, dealing in
diamonds, copper and cobalt.
	   But there appears to be little support for the intervention
among average Zimbabweans. Newspaper reports and rumors from some
of the soldier's family members have filled the information void
left by the government.
	   Rumor has it that more than 60 soldiers have died either in
battle or from malaria, sleeping sickness and other diseases.
Soldiers' toes are reportedly rotting in boots that never dry.
Newspapers also claimed that many disenchanted troops were on the
verge of revolt.
	   Col. Chancellor Diye, head of the Zimbabwe army information
directorate, insists Zimbabwe has lost only seven soldiers in
combat, two more to ``natural causes'' and 16 have been captured.
	   ``It is the rainy season up there, but we are not bogged down.
Our soldiers are well protected from disease,'' said Diye. ``It's
all lies. We have no problems at all. Morale is high.''
	   Few Zimbabweans believe him. The first report of casualties came
inadvertently from a cleaner at the air force hospital at Harare's
Manyame air base and was only later confirmed by the government.
	   ``We have never had a culture of openness here and people have
every right to be skeptical,'' said Harare defense analyst Michael
Quintana.

Report: Singapore will try to expand trade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ In another attempt to ride out the regional
economic crisis, Singapore will send more trade missions to the
Middle East and Africa to boost exports, the Trade Development
Board said Friday.
	   Singapore's exports to the United States, European Union,
Australia, China and India have continued to grow this year, the
board said in a statement.
	   The city-state's exports to the Middle East, Africa and Central
and Eastern Europe have also grown, mostly due to the fall of Asian
currencies.
	   Exports to the Southeast Asian markets of Malaysia, Philippines,
Thailand and Brunei have declined in the first 10 months of the
year.
	   But regional exports will continue to be a major focus in
Singapore's trade strategy, the statement said.
	   Singapore ``is still optimistic about the region's potential,''
it said.

	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 83.01 points, or 0.8 percent,
to 9,963.14. On Thursday, the index had slipped 9.63 points.
	   Turnover amounted to 4.51 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
578 million), down from Thursday's 5.61 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 719 million).
	   Brokers said share prices fell in reaction to an overnight slump
on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average dropped
184.86 points, or 2 percent, to 8,879.68.
	   Investors shrugged off expectations of cuts in local interest
rates, they said.
	   After the market closed, Hong Kong leading banks announced they
were cutting their prime lending rate, reserved for the most
creditworthy customers, to 9.25 percent from 9.50 percent.
	   Among properties, Cheung Kong fell 1.00 Hong Kong dollar to
53.25, and Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 75 cents to 55.75.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings fell 1.00 dollar to 185.50,
and Hang Seng Bank also fell 1.00 dollar to 65.25.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa fell 1.50 dollars to 51.50, and
Swire Pacific ``A'' was unchanged to 35.30.

Yeltsin plans to meet officials in hospital, no word on release
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin planned to meet government
officials Friday in the hospital where he's been treated for
pneumonia for nearly two weeks, his spokesman said.
	   Spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin wouldn't say when Yeltsin would be
discharged from the government hospital where he was admitted on
Nov. 22. Other aides said this week that the president may return
to work at the Kremlin on Monday, but there was no sign that the
president was about to be released.
	   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, one of Russia's most prominent
politicians and a likely presidential candidate, said the
president's frequent ailments have weakened the government.
	   ``The president is ill indeed and he can work effectively only
for a small part of his working time,'' Luzhkov said in an
interview with Germany's ARD television on Thursday night. ``All of
us feel the absence of the president.''
	   However, ``even the fact that the president is in place is a
certain stabilizing factor for the society,'' Luzhkov said in
remarks that were also carried by the Interfax news agency. ``There
is no reason to see the president's health problem as equal to the
danger of the country's collapse.''
	   Yeltsin's bout of pneumonia is his second in as many years and
the latest in a string of illnesses that have eroded his authority
and raised doubts about his ability to serve out a term that ends
in 2000.
	   Ruslan Orekhov, head of the presidential legal department,
dismissed speculation that Yeltsin's was growing weaker and that
the president employs a machine, rather than his own hand, to sign
official documents.
	   ``The facsimile (machine) is never used on presidential
orders,'' Orekhov told the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda, adding that
it's only used on occasion to sign routine documents.
	   Orekhov also denied allegations that documents presented to
Yeltsin are typed in extra large letters to make them easier to
read.
	   At several public ceremonies, Yeltsin has signed documents in an
extremely slow and laborious manner, but Orekhov said this was
merely a personal habit, not a sign of his weakness.

Parliament to pass first steps of Schroeder's agenda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Parliament was voting Friday on the first
steps in Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's center-left agenda, a tax
cut and higher government payments to families with children.
	   Six weeks after taking power, the government alliance of Social
Democrats and Greens was expected to make good on two campaign
pledges and pass the measures easily in the lower chamber, where it
holds a 21-seat majority.
	   At the session's start, the opposition failed with a motion to
delay the debate because Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine was on a
trip to Washington.
	   Hans-Peter Repnik of the Christian Democrats accused the
government of ``chaos'' in its rush to fulfill promises for voters.
	   The measures are part of a larger reform including 15 billion
marks (dlrs 9 billion) in income tax relief, but also an increase
in energy taxes and fewer writeoffs for business. Parliament is
expected to take up the rest of the package early next year.
	   On Friday's agenda was a cut in the lowest individual income tax
bracket to 23.9 percent from 25.9 percent on Jan. 1, which the
government says will shave 1,700 marks (dlrs 1,020) off the average
wage earner's tax bill next year.
	   A modest cut in the top tax rate is planned later.
	   Also, government aid to families is to rise by 30 marks (dlrs
18) to 250 marks (dlrs 150) per child on Jan. 1.
	   Mocking the government's haste, opposition politicians have
called the increase a ``Christmas present'' to voters.
	   ``We've kept our word,'' said Social Democratic lawmaker Joachim
Poss. ``This proves how determined and decisive the new government
coalition is.''

Dutch govt. to farmers: Don't have a cow, man
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Holy cow! Too many bovines are
crowding the Dutch countryside, the government has warned.
	   Europe's most densely populated nation turns out to have more
than its share of cows, too, the Central Bureau for Statistics
reported Thursday. One in four Dutch farms maintains more cows than
the land can support, the agency said.
	   The Agriculture Ministry has set a maximum of 2.5 cows per
hectare, but farms nationwide exceed that limit by 0.7 cows. Of the
Netherlands' 33,000 dairy farms, 8,825 have too many cows, the
report said.
	   All those grazing cows may make for pretty scenery, but they
raise the risk that drinking water can become polluted from manure
that easily seeps through the sandy Dutch soil and into
groundwater.
	   The most cow-crowded provinces are North Brabant, Gelderland and
Overijssel, the Dutch ``milk belt'' where most dairies are located.

Miyamoto widens lead on second day of play
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INAGI, Japan (AP) _ Katsumasa Miyamoto of Japan widened his lead
to five strokes on Friday, the second day of the 100 million yen
(dlrs 833,000) Golf Nippon Series JT Cup tournament for the year's
top golfers in Japan.
	   The 26-year-old Miyamoto, seeking his second career victory,
sank five birdies and bogeyed twice to finish the day with a
three-under 67. That gives him a nine-under-par 131 so far in the
four-day tournament.
	   Nobuhito Sato, also from Japan, stayed in second place with a 68
and a four-under 136.
	   Brian Watts of the United States and four Japanese players were
a stroke behind in third place with a three-under 137 after the
second round on the 6,960-yard, par-70 Tokyo Yomiuri Country Club
course on the outskirts of Tokyo.
	   Teeing off in the cold cloudy weather were 26 of the best
golfers on the Japanese professional circuit, made up of this
year's tournament winners, the defending champion and the top 20 on
the Japan PGA money earning list.
	   The winner takes home 30 million yen (dlrs 250,000).
	   Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki, who leads the Japan PGA money ranking
list with 166.63 million yen (dlrs 1.4 million) in winnings this
season, dropped from second to fourth after a shooting a
less-than-stellar par 70. He has a two-under 138 for the tournament
so far.
	   American Todd Hamilton, who finished the previous day with a
disappointing four-over 74, battled his way back into fifth place
with the best score for the day, a five-under 65. That gives him a
one-under 139.
	   Another American, Brandt Jobe, second only to Ozaki on the Japan
circuit with 95.17 million yen (dlrs 793,000) in prize money this
year, was stuck in last place with a seven-over-par 147.
	   Frankie Minoza of the Philippines shot a 71 and tied for sixth
place with Hidemichi Tanaka of Japan.
	   Defending champion Shigeki Maruyama shot a 68 but remains in
eighth place at 142.
	   While the temperature warmed up slightly from Thursday, it was
still a chilly 7 degrees Celsius (45 F). Some areas of Tokyo
recorded their first snowfall overnight.

Quake causes panic in southern Turkey; no damage reported
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CEYHAN, Turkey (AP) _ An earthquake on Friday caused panic but
no damage or injuries in this southern Turkish town, the scene of a
deadly temblor a few months ago.
	   Hundreds of people fled their homes in fear when the quake,
which had a preliminary magnitude of 4.2 according to Istanbul's
Kandilli observatory, struck in the morning.
	   In June, a 6.3 quake leveled Ceyhan, some 500 kilometers (312
miles) south of the capital Ankara, and its surrounding area,
killing 144 people.
	   Turkey's Aegean and Mediterranean coastal areas and the entire
eastern region sit atop the Anatolian fault.

Seventy percent of budget goes to army
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Parliament passed next year's
federal budget, which allots 70 percent of expenditures to the
Yugoslav army, the daily Danas reported Friday.
	   The budget of 15,8 billion dinars (dlrs 1,58 billion), adopted
Thursday, is 63.5 percent higher than the 1998 budget. After years
of international sanctions and military campaigns against
non-Serbs, the Yugoslav economy is in ruins.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has used the army to back
Serbs against other ethnic groups in the region several times over
the past decade, most recently against militant ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo.
	   His government has allotted around 60 to 70 percent of the
federal budget to the military in recent years, apparently in an
attempt to ensure loyalty and lessen complaints of underfunding
from ranking officers.
	   Milosevic is particularly interested in keeping generals happy
in the wake of a recent purge of officials critical of his
policies, including Gen. Momcilo Perisic, the army chief of staff.
	   The parliament session was boycotted by pro-reformist
legislators from Montenegro, which makes up Yugoslavia along with
larger Serbia. The legislators oppose Milosevic's appointment of
Momir Bulatovic as Yugoslav premier after Bulatovic was ousted as
Montenegro's president in elections last year.

Iran launches five-day military maneuvers in the Gulf
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's naval forces and its elite
Revolutionary Guards launched exercises in the Gulf Friday, Tehran
radio reported.
	   The five-day exercises began with defensive amphibious
operations and the shelling of targets by warships and air force
fighter-bombers, the radio said.
	   The 50,000 forces taking part also will practice mine-laying,
mine-sweeping, chemical attack scenarios, and air defense tactics
later in the week, the radio said.
	   The maneuvers, code-named Unity 77, would extend from the
central Gulf to the Strait of Hormuz and into the Gulf of Oman, the
radio said.
	   Earlier this week, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
said that the maneuvers would assess the country's defense against
chemical, biological and nuclear attacks.
	   ``The other objectives of this great exercise are to boost our
ability to plan for combined operations,'' Isa Galverdi, a
commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, told the
radio.
	   He said war veterans would transfer knowledge gained from the
1980-88 war with Iraq to new recruits and younger officers.
	   The maneuvers would ``raise the combat capability of the forces,
improve the battle-readiness and accuracy of weapons, practice
combat skills above and under the water and evaluate our ability to
defend the country's strategic shore lines,'' the radio quoted
Galverdi as saying.
	   He told IRNA earlier this week that 160 naval vessels and 120
aircraft will take part in the war games, which would involve
missile-launching units of the Revolutionary Guards.
	   An Iranian military official told The Associated Press that an
electronic warfare system capable of jamming enemy radar would also
be put to the test.
	   He said that until now, the Iranian navy only had the capability
to defend against electronic warfare. But new systems developed
internally will give Iranian warships the capability of jamming
enemy electronics, the official said. He spoke on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The exercises kicked off with a six-gun salute ``as a sign of
respect, peace and friendship'' between Iran and the six Gulf Arab
countries, the radio said.
	   Iran's navy chief, Rear Adm. Ali Akbar Ahmadian, said Monday
that military officials from Oman would take part as observers in
the maneuvers.
	   Iran has tried for a decade to conduct joint military exercises
with Gulf states which are allies of the United States. But so far,
no Gulf country has agreed because of Tehran's insistence that U.S.
warships leave the region.

French, British defense ministers sign military agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By THIBAULT LEROUX &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-MALO, France (AP) _ France and Britain agreed to intensify
their defense cooperation Friday in order to react more quickly to
international crises such as Kosovo.
	   Defense Ministers Alain Richard of France and George Robertson
of Britain signed an agreement Friday that would allow for greater
cooperation in crisis management and military operations.
	   French President Jacques Chirac and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair were also expected to sign an agreement on European defense
before Friday's closing of a two-day summit in the Brittany port
town of St. Malo.
	   Though differences on defense policy remain between the Paris
and London, Chirac Spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said late Thursday
the two leaders were likely to sign an accord on European defense
that would provide for closer Franco-British cooperation.
	   The EU is sensitive to criticism that it reacts too slowly and
in disjointed fashion to crises such as Kosovo, forcing the United
States to take the lead in resolving continental conflicts.
	   France has been pushing for an independent European defense,
starting with a European pillar within NATO. But Britain has said
NATO must remain the cornerstone of defense and security.
	   Blair, Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin attended the
summit, which began Thursday evening and was to last until noon on
Friday, in the Brittany port town of Saint Malo.
	   Topics on the agenda included EU tax levels, small business, and
cooperation in Africa, where both countries have former colonies.
	   But defense and security were seen dominating the meeting.
	   Blair is accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott,
Chancellor Gordon Brown, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and Defense
Secretary George Robertson.
	   France is also represented by Defense Minister Alain Richard and
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine.
	   Officials met in Paris on Wednesday for three hours to discuss
defense.
	   Britain and France, both nuclear powers and U.N. Security
Council members, traditionally have been at odds over the role of
the European Union.
	   But both now recognize the need for Europe to cope militarily
when the United States does not get involved in crises.
	   Paris and London have stressed there are no plans yet to abolish
the Western European Union, the EU's fledgling defense arm, or to
merge it into the European Union.
	   The summit comes on the heels of a Franco-German summit earlier
this week in Potsdam.
	   French officials say the summit, unprecedented in terms of the
number of officials attending, is the result of a change in British
policy toward the EU since Blair's Labor Party took over from the
Conservative Party in May 1997.

Villagers attack Chinese police in demolition clash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Villagers took up shovels to fight with police
as authorities began demolishing homes that had been illegally
built in southern China, Hong Kong newspapers reported Friday.
	   The battle raged for two hours, with both sides sustaining
injuries before numerous villagers were arrested Thursday outside
the city of Shenzhen, according to Hong Kong newspapers that cited
information from Chinese television.
	   Demolition crews moved in with bulldozers and protection from
100 police officers, the reports said. The defiant villagers
initially stood their ground, blocking the road and throwing
stones.
	   Police eventually won the fight, and four buildings were torn
down, the reports said.
	   The Chinese-language newspaper Apple Daily, based in Hong Kong,
printed Chinese television footage of villagers wielding shovels
against police.
	   The news accounts had few details, and a spokesman for the
foreign affairs office of the Shenzhen municipal government
declined comment.
	   Officials had wanted to tear down the buildings for several
years, because they had been built without proper access to the
land, but a dispute over compensation had stalled the demolition,
the South China Morning Post said.
	   Land disputes have become common in recent years as Chinese
residents oppose government redevelopment plans that offer minimal
compensation for people who are moved.

Seventy percent of budget goes to army
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Parliament passed next year's
federal budget, which allots 70 percent of expenditures to the
Yugoslav army, the daily Danas reported Friday.
	   The budget of 15,8 billion dinars (dlrs 1,58 billion), adopted
Thursday, is 63.5 percent higher than the 1998 budget. After years
of international sanctions and military campaigns against
non-Serbs, the Yugoslav economy is in ruins.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has used the army to back
Serbs against other ethnic groups in the region several times over
the past decade, most recently against militant ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo.
	   His government has allotted around 60 to 70 percent of the
federal budget to the military in recent years, apparently in an
attempt to ensure loyalty and lessen complaints of underfunding
from ranking officers.
	   Milosevic is particularly interested in keeping generals happy
in the wake of a recent purge of officials critical of his
policies, including Gen. Momcilo Perisic, the army chief of staff.
	   The parliament session was boycotted by pro-reformist
legislators from Montenegro, which makes up Yugoslavia along with
larger Serbia. The legislators oppose Milosevic's appointment of
Momir Bulatovic as Yugoslav premier after Bulatovic was ousted as
Montenegro's president in elections last year.

ASEAN must rethink non-interference policy, says U.S. admiral
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Southeast Asian nations battling a protracted
financial crisis will have to reassess their commitment of
non-interference in each other's affairs, the commander of U.S.
forces in the Pacific said Friday.
	   Adm. Joseph Prueher, commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific
command, said that ``if nations are participating in the global
economy, it automatically means you interfere with another nation's
affairs.''
	   ``If you look at how political, economic and military issues are
irrevocably overlapped and tied together, you'd want to get into
another nation's affairs,'' Prueher said in an address to the Asia
Society.
	   The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a regional group,
will meet in Hanoi, Vietnam on Dec. 15-16 to tackle political and
economic issues as member nations remain mired in recession.
	   ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand, Laos, Burma and Vietnam.
	   Many member nations are seeking to stave off any discussion on
possible compromises over the ASEAN's founding principle of
non-interference in members' internal affairs.
	   Such proposals have come from the Philippines and Thailand after
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim was fired and jailed
on abuse of power and sex charges.
	   Prueher said that the United States would remain ``heavily
engaged'' in the region in the event that the Asian economic crisis
spins off into a security crisis _ as the overlapping claims over
the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea have threatened to
become.
	   The Spratlys are believed to be rich in oil, gas and minerals.
China, Vietnam and Taiwan claim all of the Spratlys, while the
Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei claim parts of the chain.
	   Prueher said Washington was committed to seeing ``sovereignty
issues being solved peacefully,'' saying it ``would be involved
only if freedom of navigation becomes an issue.''
	   Prueher said that U.S. military relations with China were good
and improving at a steady pace.
	   He noted it was important for China ``to recognize the U.S. will
honor its commitment to peaceful resolution of Taiwan issues.''
	   China views Taiwan as a renegade province after Chiang
Kai-shek's defeated Nationalists fled to the island in 1949.
	   When China test-fired missiles off the Taiwan Straits in
1995-96, the United States sent in military reinforcements _
prompting sharp criticism from Beijing.
	   Despite ``residual animosities'' between Japan and China,
Prueher noted a possible ``strategic constructive partnership''
between Japan and China.
	   He called the recent visit of Chinese President Jiang Zemin to
Japan ``a very good start, but not the success people hoped for.''

Muslim mobs burn Christian church in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Cheering Muslim mobs on Friday burned
a Roman Catholic church in a provincial capital in the latest
outburst of religious violence in Indonesia.
	   At first, thousands of rioters blocked fire trucks from reaching
the church in Ujungpandang, the capital of South Sulawesi province,
840 miles (1,350 kilometers) east of Jakarta.
	   The trucks eventually made it through but the church and two
houses were gutted, said Muhamad Adam, a fire brigade official.
	   Police and soldiers patrolled the area after the mobs dispersed.
	   Last week, Christian rioters in the city of Kupang, southeast of
Jakarta, burned and ransacked 15 mosques in retaliation for the
Nov. 22 burning of churches in Jakarta.
	   The violence has raised fears that revenge attacks on places of
worship could escalate in the world's most populous Muslim nation.
	   Ninety percent of Indonesia's 200 million people are Muslim,
with the rest belonging to Christian, Buddhist and other faiths.
	   Religious diversity based on a belief in God is enshrined in the
national philosophy, known as Pancasila, adopted when Indonesia
declared independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945.
	   But social tensions, fueled by widespread unemployment, have
intensified in Indonesia amid the worst economic crisis in decades.

Vienna ex-mayor to visit Havel, discuss allegations of spying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The ex mayor of Vienna is expected
to meet next week with President Vaclav Havel to discuss
allegations of the Austrian's collaboration with the police under
the past communist regime, the daily Pravo reported Friday.
	   According to Havel's spokesman Ladislav Spacek, Havel issued the
invitation to former Mayor Helmut Zilk Thursday, but no specific
date was announced.
	   Zilk was rejected for a Czech Republic medal of honor just three
days before the official ceremony on Oct 28, because of sudden
allegations that he was an informant for police in communist
Czechoslovakia.
	   Havel's office then cited newspaper reports and other
unspecified information supposedly confirming the allegations. By
law, Havel has no official access to the communist police files.
	   Zilk, 71, denied the allegations as ``absolute nonsense''.
	   According to Spacek, Havel was briefed Thursday on the contents
of Zilk's file by Interior minister Vaclav Grulich and archive
manager Jan Frolik.

Report: Indonesian earthquake toll jumps to 50
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The death toll from an earthquake that
hit several remote islands in eastern Indonesia has jumped to 50, a
newspaper reported Friday.
	   The 6.5-magnitude quake rocked Mangole and adjacent islands in
the Maluku Sea on Sunday night, flattening buildings and setting
off landslides.
	   Six people were initially reported killed, but the toll rose as
reports came in from remote villages.
	   The daily Suara Pembaruan quoted Social Affairs Minister Justika
Baharsyah as saying that a lack of transport had hampered efforts
to deliver assistance for the victims.
	   ``We keep monitoring the number of the victims, and now, the
number of dead victims has reach 50,'' Justika said without
elaborating.
	   Early reports said 27 people were killed and seven were missing.
Local officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   Meanwhile, a total 543 people had been evacuated from Sonit
Island, west of Mangole, Antara said.
	   Most of houses on the island were ruined, said the report from
Palu, the capital of Central Sulawesi. No casualties were reported.
	   Earlier, local government officials said more than 150 people
were injured and more than 858 homes and buildings damaged on
Mangole and neighboring Taliabu island.
	   Mangole and Taliabu are in the Maluku archipelago, known as the
Spice Islands in colonial times, while Sonit is part of Central
Sulawesi.
	   Indonesia, which is part of the so-called ``Pacific Ring of
Fire,'' is prone to earthquakes.

Turkish court acquits Ciller's husband in retrial of fraud case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The husband of formfer Prime Minister
Tansu Ciller was acquitted Friday in a retrial on charges which
stemmed from a parliamentary probe of the family wealth.
	   Earlier this year, Ozer Ciller had been found guilty of misuse
of power for altering official papers, which documented the wealth
and were submitted to a parliamentary commission, and sentenced to
a symbolic fine of dlrs 8.
	   In Friday's ruling, Judge Mustafa Batu said the allegations
could not be proven.
	   Mrs. Ciller, premier from 1993-1996, and her husband have been
dogged by corruption allegations since she came to power. She
survived several parliamentary probes mostly with the help of her
coalition allies of the time.
	   The Cillers have always denied any wrongdoing and accuse rivals
of plotting to ruin Mrs. Ciller's political career.
	   The family reportedly own several million dollars' worth of
assets both in Turkey and the United States, including a hotel, a
shopping mall and a house.
	   Two weeks ago, Mrs. Ciller again was cleared in a corruption
probe, this time with the help of a rival center-right party, in a
gesture toward a possible coalition alliance.
	   Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit is trying to put together a
government that would include Mrs. Ciller's True Path party.
	   The retrial was ordered by an appeals court which had doubts
that a crime had been committed.

Middle East talks held in Stockholm for four years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Talks on the Middle East peace process
have been held in the Swedish capital since 1994, trying to build
on the agreements worked out in the secret ''Oslo Channel'' talks,
officials said Friday.
	   Shlomo Morgan, a spokesman for the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm,
said the talks had included Yossi Beilin, a leader of the Labour
Party that is now in the opposition in Israel, and Ahmed Qureia who
is speaker of the Palestinian legislative assembly.
	   At the time the Stockholm talks began, Beilin's party was in
government, and they continued after Likud's Benjamin Netanyahu
became prime minister, which brought a long stall in the peace
process.
	   ''Talks have taken place with a certain regularity,'' Swedish
Foreign Minister Anna Lindh told the news agency TT. ''They hang
together _ the Oslo process and these talks.''
	   The Oslo talks led to the historic Israel-PLO peace accord.
	   ''Nevertheless, I can't point to any specific results'' from the
Stockholm talks, Lindh was quoted as saying.
	   Morgan told The Associated Press that one of the results was a
non-binding proposal, which had been published in the Israeli
press, for a Palestinian capital to be established in a village
near Jerusalem rather than in the city itself.
	   Confirmation of the Stockholm talks came a day before
Palestinian Yasser Arafat was scheduled to visit. The trip
officially is to attend a meeting marking the 10th anniversary of
Arafat's statement in Stockholm recognizing Israel's right to
exist.
	   However, expectations are high that Arafat may use the occasion
to make a major policy speech outlining his vision for a permanent
Middle East peace.

Russian ruble tumbles, inflation to top 70 percent this year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ruble lower, industrial production down 5 percent
this year, ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian ruble tumbled again Friday, trading at
about 20 to the U.S. dollar and threatening to hit its lowest point
since the country's economic crisis struck in August.
	   The ruble's latest slide is an ominous sign for the government,
which desperately wants to stabilize the economy as Russia heads
into the difficult winter months.
	   With President Boris Yeltsin hospitalized, and Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov still struggling to implement a recovery plan, the
economy continues to founder and remains vulnerable to additional
shocks.
	   The government is urgently seeking foreign help, but
International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus came and left
this week without giving any signal that a frozen loan package will
be released soon.
	   With the country's financial markets essentially wiped out by
the economic crisis, the value of the ruble is one of the leading
indicators of economic confidence, and it is again on the decline.
	   After stabilizing temporarily at about 16 to the dollar, it has
been falling in recent days. The rate set by the Moscow Interbank
Currency Exchange was 19.6 on Friday, and in street trading it took
more than 20 rubles to purchase one U.S. dollar.
	   The ruble dipped below 20 to the dollar shortly after the
country's economic crisis hit in August, then made a modest
comeback. The ruble was at about 6 to the dollar before the crisis.
	   Meanwhile, the government announced that inflation has gone up
more than 65 percent so far this year and is expected to top 70
percent by year's end.
	   Russian inflation had been coming down after years of soaring
prices and was expected to be in single digits this year until the
country's economic crisis hit.
	   If the government does not receive foreign assistance soon, it
is expected to start printing more rubles to pay off millions of
workers and pensioners who haven't received their money for months.
	   But the additional money is almost certain to push inflation
higher and would risk bringing back the hyperinflation that Russia
suffered during the early 1990s.
	   Russia's problems could get worse next year when its dlrs 17.5
billion dollar foreign debt falls due. Several officials have
already said the country won't be able to meet these payments and
have called for creditors to set new terms for payment.

Philippine stocks end higher on last-minute bargain hunting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with peso closing lower

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ After three days of losses,
Philippine stocks capped a volatile session Friday with modest
gains from last-minute bargain hunting.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index ended 15.61 points,
or 0.9 percent, higher at 1,822.64 after losing nearly 50 points
early in the session following the release of the inflation data.
	   On Thursday the index plunged 78.97 points, or 4.2 percent,
bringing its total loss since Tuesday to 168.33 points, or 8.5
percent.
	   Gainers outpaced decliners Friday 54 to 43, while 31 issues were
unchanged.
	   Jose Ricardo Garcia, vice president for Diversified Securities
Inc., said the worse-than-expected November inflation data
triggered a knee-jerk reaction among investors, who went on a
selling spree soon after trading started.
	   Before the market opened, the government reported that inflation
in November was 11.2 percent on an annual basis, up from 10.2
percent the previous month and the highest level since January
1996.
	   The government blamed sharp increases in food prices for the
higher inflation rate.
	   Garcia said the 184.86-point, or 2 percent, loss suffered
overnight by the Dow Jones Industrial Average further encouraged
selling.
	   The market's early weakness, however, soon gave way to
bargain-hunting, attesting to the market's resilience, Garcia said.
	   He said the rise in last month's consumer price index shouldn't
be cause for concern since the average inflation rate from January
to November remains at a single-digit level at 9.7 percent.
	   ``Inflation has been kept in check despite the economic
slowdown,'' he said.
	   In currency trading, the peso weakened against the dollar,
breaching the key 39 peso level as demand for the U.S. currency
picked up after the release of the inflation data, dealers said.
	   The dollar averaged 38.880 pesos for the day, up from Thursday's
38.795 pesos. It traded in a thin range of 38.720 pesos to 39.100
pesos and last changed hands at 39.010 pesos.
	   ``Some corporations have started to buy dollars. Add that to
banks squaring their positions, you'll have a weaker peso,'' said a
trader for a foreign bank.
	   November's inflation data struck a negative chord, traders said,
pressuring the peso despite steady dollar inflows from Filipinos
working overseas.
	   About 4.5 million Filipinos work abroad, sending home at least
dlrs 6 billion last year. Their foreign-exchange remittances
provide an important contribution to the Philippine economy, and
are expected to help support the peso over the rest of the year.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Riot police scuffled with about 100
protesters Friday as they marched toward Indonesia's National
Monument Friday to press demands for greater democracy.
	   No one was injured and no arrests were reported.
	   Another 300 student protesters defied warnings from the military
and staged a noisy but peaceful street rally not far from the
nearby presidential palace.
	   Squads of troops and armored personnel carriers blocked the
students, many wearing brightly colored jackets, when they marched
to a busy intersection only a few hundred meters (yards) from the
palace complex near Jakarta's Chinatown.
	   They chanted anti-government slogans and called on the
government to accelerate and extend a push for greater democracy.
Some handed flowers to soldiers.
	   The students also demanded that former authoritarian President
Suharto be put on trial.
	   Friday's demonstrations are the latest in a series of almost
daily protests against President B.J. Habibie who announced
Thursday parliamentary elections were set for June 7.
	   Indonesia's highest legislative body, the People's Consultative
Assembly, is to convene in August to select a new head of state.
	   Habibie has also promised to step up an ongoing investigation
into Suharto's wealth after abandoning a plan to set up a
commission of inquiry into the old leader's affairs.
	   On Wednesday more than 1,500 students broke through what should
have been a tight security cordon and got to within a few meters
(yards) the ornate white-columned palace.
	   The military has warned students not to attempt more protests
near the Dutch-built colonial mansion.
	   ``Demonstrations around the palace are illegal,'' said Maj. Gen.
Suwandi, who is in charge of palace security.
	   On Nov. 13 soldiers shot dead nine students when they tried to
march on Parliament.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Once at the top of world field hockey,
India would like to have a hockey god to help regain that glory.
	   ``Things are changing in Bangkok, and we are feeling much
better,'' Rajinder Singh, manager of the Indian hockey squad, said
Friday, a day after the Indians defeated Japan 3-2 in a warmup
match for the Asian Games.
	   The Indians, who number 980 million, have an amazing quality of
discovering gods who number in hundreds of thousands. There is even
a goddess for small pox and Indians still pray to her to keep that
disease, almost eradicated, away.
	   ``We believe in divine blessings and we hope it pours on us,''
said Singh.
	   There are so many ifs for the Indians on the way to a gold medal
in the 12-nation tournament that it may well be luck besides skill
and endurance needed to reach the top.
	   In its glory days, skill helped India win a total of eight
Olympic gold medals, the most recently in 1980. But the Indians
have won an Asian Games gold medal only once, silver eight times
and bronze once.
	   The South Koreans, who have remained a force in field hockey
since winning the gold in the 1986 Asian Games at home, are clearly
the favorite.
	   Between winning the last Asian Games gold in Hiroshima in 1994,
the Koreans have figured in two World Cups, two Champions Trophy
events and the Atlanta Olympics.
	   The Indians were silver medalists at Hiroshima, but since then
have suffered a downward swing. They placed eighth at the 1996
Olympics and one step lower in the Utrecht World Cup. At this
year's Commonwealth Games, India was out of the medals.
	   In Bangkok, however, there are some silver linings.
	   Skipper Dhanraj Pillay is a passionate player and no defense is
safe against him if he gets the ball properly. Baljit Singh
Dhillon, a specialist in flick-drives in goal-winning penalty
corners, has shaped up well.
	   Pakistan, India's traditional rival in the subcontinent on many
issues besides sports, can also dampen the Indian hope for a
comeback. Pakistan has won the Asian Games gold medal seven times,
silver twice and bronze once.
	   The other medalists at the Asians Games have been Malaysia with
five bronzes and Japan with two.

Report: Indonesia's attorney general to question Suharto next week
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS house arrest possible. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Government investigators plan to
question former President Suharto next week over corruption
allegations and could place him under house arrest, officials said
Friday.
	   ``We will question the former president at the Attorney
General's Office,'' the official Antara news agency quoted Attorney
General Andi Mohamad Ghalib as saying.
	   Antara said Ghalib did not specify the date of the questioning
but stressed the investigation into Suharto's wealth would be based
on a presumption of innocence.
	   Meanwhile, State Secretary Akbar Tanjung repeated an earlier
warning that officials might place Suharto under house arrest if he
does not cooperate with the investigation.
	   On Thursday, President B.J. Habibie ordered Ghalib to question
his predecessor, Suharto, immediately over claims that the old
leader abused his power and acted corruptly to amass a fortune for
himself, his family and a clique of cronies during his 32 years in
power.
	   Suharto, who quit after riots and protests in May, has denied
any wrongdoing. He has stated that he will cooperate with any
inquiry.
	   However, Akbar said the attorney general has the authority to
place Suharto under house arrest.
	   Ghalib has questioned Suharto before. But an earlier
investigation failed to find any evidence.
	   Critics have accused Ghalib, a serving army general, of going
soft on Suharto, and had criticized the investigation as a
whitewash.
	   Forbes magazine this year estimated Suharto's wealth at dlrs 4
billion. Others say the figure is higher.
	   Student protesters have taken to the streets almost daily
demanding that Suharto be tried.
	   Habibie, meanwhile, abandoned plans for an independent
corruption inquiry of Suharto.
	   The government had trouble finding public figures who were
willing to join the panel, which was viewed as only a cosmetic
gesture to appease student activists.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ A Palestinian university student who
participated in an attack on an Israeli soldier and seized his M-16
assault rifle has been arrested, a senior Palestinian official said
Friday.
	   The rifle was handed over to the governor of the West Bank town
of Ramallah, Mustafa Issa, on Wednesday night, several hours after
about a dozen Palestinians pelted an Israeli car with stones,
pulled the soldier out of the vehicle and struck him repeatedly in
the head with rocks.
	   The soldier escaped with head injuries. The incident, captured
by TV cameras, triggered an outrage in Israel and led to Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to suspend the upcoming West
Bank troop withdrawal.
	   The Palestinian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the M-16 was handed over by Palestinian university students
not involved in the attack on the soldier.
	   One of the students was held for questioning, however, and later
the student who had seized the M-16 was arrested.
	   Israel and the Palestinians have blamed each other for the
violence, which came days before U.S. President Bill Clinton was to
arrive in the region to usher in the second stage of the Wye River
land-for-security agreement.

Iran launches five-day military maneuvers in the Gulf
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's naval forces and its elite
Revolutionary Guards launched exercises in the Gulf Friday, Tehran
radio reported.
	   The five-day exercises began with defensive amphibious
operations and the shelling of targets by warships and air force
fighter-bombers, the radio said.
	   The 50,000 forces taking part also will practice mine-laying,
mine-sweeping, chemical attack scenarios, and air defense tactics
later in the week, the radio said.
	   The maneuvers, code-named Unity 77, would extend from the
central Gulf to the Strait of Hormuz and into the Gulf of Oman, the
radio said.
	   Earlier this week, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
said that the maneuvers would assess the country's defense against
chemical, biological and nuclear attacks.
	   ``The other objectives of this great exercise are to boost our
ability to plan for combined operations,'' Isa Galverdi, a
commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, told the
radio.
	   An Iranian military official told The Associated Press that an
electronic warfare system capable of jamming enemy radar would also
be put to the test.
	   He said that until now, the Iranian navy only had the capability
to defend against electronic warfare. But new systems developed
internally will give Iranian warships the capability of jamming
enemy electronics, the official said. He spoke on customary
condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-MALO, France (AP) _ France and Britain on Friday agreed to
intensify their defense cooperation in order to react more quickly
to international crises such as Kosovo.
	   Defense Ministers Alain Richard of France and George Robertson
of Britain, who met onboard two frigates, signed an agreement that
would allow for greater cooperation in crisis management and
military operations.
	   French President Jacques Chirac, French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin and British Prime Minister Tony Blair were also expected to
sign an agreement on European defense before Friday's closing of a
two-day summit in the Brittany port town of St. Malo.
	   ``The text has already been worked out,'' Marc El Nouchi, an aid
to Jospin, said Friday morning.
	   Though differences on defense policy remain between the Paris
and London, Chirac Spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said late Thursday
the leaders were likely to sign an accord on European defense that
would provide for closer Franco-British cooperation.
	   The EU is sensitive to criticism that it reacts too slowly and
in disjointed fashion to crises such as Kosovo, forcing the United
States to take the lead in resolving continental conflicts.
	   France has been pushing for an independent European defense,
starting with a European pillar within NATO. But Britain has said
NATO must remain the cornerstone of defense and security.
	   Blair, Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin attended the
summit, which began Thursday evening and was to last until noon on
Friday.
	   Topics on the agenda included EU tax levels, small business, and
cooperation in Africa, where both countries have former colonies. A
possible merger between British Aerospace PLC and Germany's Daimler
Benz Aerospace is also expected to be discussed.
	   But defense and security were seen dominating the meeting.
	   Blair is accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott,
Chancellor Gordon Brown, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and Defense
Secretary Robertson.
	   France is also represented by Defense Minister Richard and
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine.
	   Officials met in Paris on Wednesday for three hours to discuss
defense.
	   Britain and France, both nuclear powers and U.N. Security
Council members, traditionally have been at odds over the role of
the European Union.
	   But both now recognize the need for Europe to cope militarily
when the United States does not get involved in crises.
	   Paris and London have stressed there are no plans yet to abolish
the Western European Union, the EU's fledgling defense arm, or to
merge it into the European Union.
	   The summit comes follows a Franco-German summit earlier this
week in Potsdam.
	   French officials say the summit, unprecedented in terms of the
number of officials attending, is the result of a change in British
policy toward the EU since Blair's Labor Party took over from the
Conservative Party in May 1997.

20th Century Fox cleared to film on Thai island
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand agreed on Friday to allow the
U.S. movie studio 20th Century Fox to continue its landscaping for
a movie to be shot on a southern vacation island.
	   A little more than two weeks ago, the forestry department
ordered a temporary halt to pre-production on the film ``The
Beach,'' starring Leonardo DiCaprio, to allow environmental
complaints to be examined.
	   Plans to film Alex Garland's best-selling novel on Phi Phi
Island have fallen afoul of environmentalists, who say that laws
protecting the national park there are being violated.
	   After two weeks of investigations including field trips, a
special study group appointed by the forestry department concluded
that preparing and shooting the movie would affect the environment,
but the damage would be small enough so that it can be undone.
	   The group suggested several measures to protect the environment.
	   Santa Pestanij, the Thai coordinator for the movie, said he was
partly relieved by the go-ahead, but still worried about an ongoing
protest by environmentalists and local residents, who are camping
out on the shooting site.
	   He said he is certain that 20th Century Fox will respond
positively to the study group's suggestions.
	   Santa said the protesters insisted that they will oppose the
film's shooting no matter what the study group said. To avoid
confronting the protesters, Santa said he would contact the
provincial authorities to deal with them.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Cheering Muslim mobs on Friday burned
a Roman Catholic church in a provincial capital in the latest
outburst of religious violence in Indonesia.
	   At first, thousands of rioters blocked fire trucks from reaching
the church in Ujungpandang, the capital of South Sulawesi province,
840 miles (1,350 kilometers) east of Jakarta.
	   The trucks eventually made it through but the church and two
houses were gutted, said Muhamad Adam, a fire brigade official.
	   Police and soldiers patrolled the area after the mobs dispersed.
There were no reports of injuries or arrests.
	   Police said that as night fell security personnel were guarding
other churches in the predominately Muslim city of 750,000.
	   Witnesses said mobs left neighboring mosques after Friday
Islamic prayers and set fire to the suburban Kare Catholic Church.
	   Last week, Christian rioters in the city of Kupang, southeast of
Jakarta, burned and ransacked 15 mosques in retaliation for the
Nov. 22 burning of churches in Jakarta.
	   On Thursday, a man reported to be mentally ill set three mosque
afire in Ngabang, on Borneo island, 810 kilometers (500 miles)
north of Jakarta.
	   The violence has raised fears that revenge attacks on places of
worship could escalate in the world's most populous Muslim nation.
	   Ninety percent of Indonesia's 200 million people are Muslim,
with the rest belonging to Christian, Buddhist and other faiths.
	   Religious diversity based on a belief in God is enshrined in the
national philosophy, known as Pancasila, adopted when Indonesia
declared independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945.
	   But social tensions, fueled by widespread unemployment, have
intensified in Indonesia amid the worst economic crisis in decades.
	   The attacks come despite repeated calls for calm by Indonesian
President B.J. Habibie as well as Muslim and Christian religious
leaders.

World Court won't wade into Spain-Canada fishing dispute

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The World Court said Friday it
won't wade into a fisheries dispute between Canada and Spain
sparked by the Canadians' dramatic high-seas seizure of a Spanish
trawler in 1995.
	   By a vote of 12 to 5, the United Nations' highest judicial body
said it lacks the authority to get involved in the case, which
Spain brought against Canada, because the two countries disagree on
the basis for their dispute.
	   ``The court consequently has no jurisdiction to deal with the
merits of the case,'' the judges said. There was no immediate
reaction.
	   The tussle was triggered by the highly publicized seizure of the
Spanish trawler Estai in international waters by Canadian officials
in March 1995. The Canadians had fired warning shots and arrested
the Estai's captain.
	   Spain claims the incident, which occurred in the Grand Banks off
Newfoundland, violated international laws which protect freedom of
navigation and freedom of fishing on the high seas. It has accused
Canada of ``armed coercion.''
	   The Estai was also flying the Spanish flag, which meant it was
under Spanish and not Canadian jurisdiction, Madrid contends. It
has demanded unspecified compensation.
	   Canada contends the boat was fishing for endangered turbot, was
using small-mesh gear and was underreporting its catch.
	   Canadian authorities made the arrest based on the Canadian
Coastal Fisheries Protection Act of 1994, which gives officials the
power to manage fish stocks in areas that straddle international
boundaries.
	   Friday's ruling was sure to please Canada, which argued in
initial public hearings in June that the U.N. court lacked the
authority to get involved.
	   The World Court, officially known as the International Court of
Justice, has no enforcement powers and relies on states to comply
voluntarily with its rulings.

Ukraine's president proposes floating rate for national currency
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma has ordered the
government to study the possibility of allowing the national
currency to float freely as of next year, a news report said
Friday.
	   In another development, the country's inflation was 3 percent in
October, down from 6.2 in October, officials said.
	   Overall inflation so far in 1998 has amounted to 16.2 percent,
but 13 percent of that increase has come in the past three months,
the State Statistics Committee said.
	   In a special resolution, Kuchma told the Cabinet and the
National Bank to consider abandoning the present trading band for
the currency, the hryvna, and replace it with a floating rate as of
Jan. 1, the independent Ukrainian News agency said.
	   The order came two weeks after Kuchma began speaking in favor of
softer monetary policies _ including lifting currency controls and
printing more money _ to allow the government to ease its mounting
debt burden.
	   The National Bank has worked to keep the hryvna stable since
November at 3.4 to the U.S. dollar, within a government-set trading
band of 2.5 to 3.5 to the dollar.
	   The stabilization followed two months of financial turmoil,
caused in part by the economic crisis in neighboring Russia. The
hryvna fell sharply, forcing the government to widen the old
trading band of 1.8 to 2.25 to the dollar.
	   The National Bank managed to temporarily stabilize the markets
in the past two months with the imposition of various currency
controls. But the bank has warned repeatedly that the stability was
too fragile to permit looser monetary policies in the near future.
	   National Bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko said recently that the
financial situation in Russia, Belarus and Moldova _ Ukraine's
major trade partners _ continued to worsen.
	   However, Ukraine urgently needs to raise several hundred million
dollars to keep the 1998 budget deficit at 2.5 percent of gross
domestic product. That's one of the main requirements set by the
International Monetary Fund for the disbursement of a recently
approved dlrs 2.2 billion loan.
	   The Cabinet's chronically lax tax collection and failure to
implement reforms needed to boost economic activity have led
government leaders to suggest printing money and devaluing the
hryvna to avoid a deeper crisis.
	   The government so far has made ends meet by not paying wages,
pensions and social spending debts, which Kuchma said currently
total 8.5 billion hryvna (dlrs 2.5 billion), or 40 percent of next
year's projected budget revenues.

Asian stock markets close generally higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets ended the week generally
higher Friday, but the key indexes fell both in Tokyo and Hong Kong
on the back of a sharp decline overnight on Wall Street.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 57.11
points, or 0.39 percent, closing the week at 14,639.97 points. On
Thursday, the index had shed 289.54 points, or 1.93 percent.
	   Japanese stock prices fell in thin trading on selling of
international blue chip shares.
	   The market is becoming ``very nervous about the American
economy,'' said Kazuo Takayama, chief foreign exchange manager at
Midland Bank in Tokyo.
	   In New York Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
184.86 points to 8,879.68.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 118.32 yen, down 0.91
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York
level of 118.60 yen overnight.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 83.01 points,
or 0.8 percent, to 9,963.14. On Thursday, the index had slipped
9.63 points.
	   Investors shrugged off expectations of cuts in Hong Kong
interest rates, brokers said.
	   After the market closed, Hong Kong leading banks announced they
were cutting their prime lending rate, reserved for the most
creditworthy customers, to 9.25 percent from 9.50 percent.
	   Share prices surged on the Seoul Stock Exchange, with the key
index surging 4.1 percent on hopes that the restructuring of South
Korea's five largest conglomerates will speed up.
	   A South Korean government official said on Thursday that the
Samsung Group is in talks with rival conglomerates.
	   The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 18.23 points to
466.34.
	   Share prices in Taiwan also closed higher as local institutional
investors bought stocks ahead of Saturday's legislative elections
in the country.

Philippine inflation jumps to 11.2 percent in November
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with analysts comments, stock index rising at end of
trading

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Inflation in the Philippines jumped
to 11.2 percent in November on a year-to-year basis, the highest
level in nearly three years, the government said Thursday.
	   The steep rise from 10.2 percent in October was attributed
largely to a sharp increase in food prices, which have a hefty
weighting in the consumer price index.
	   Crop damage caused by several strong typhoons pushed food prices
up 12.3 percent in November from a year earlier, compared to a 9.9
percent increase in October.
	   The November data brought the average inflation rate for the
first 11 months of the year to 9.7 percent, still below the
government's target of 10 percent.
	   Most economists had predicted consumer prices would rise just
10.1 percent in November year-on-year.
	   The 11.2 percent inflation was the highest since January 1996,
when consumer prices also rose 11.2 percent on the year.
	   Inflation was 7.6 percent in November 1997.
	   But economists predicted consumer prices should fall in
subsequent months as supplies of rice, fruits and vegetables
stabilize.
	   ``The effect of the weather disturbances is temporary, and the
underlying trend of inflation remains downward,'' said Central Bank
Managing Director Amando Tetangco.
	   After an early plunge, the stock market welcomed those views.
After three days of losses, which saw the market's main index drop
168.33 points, or 8.5 percent, on rumors that inflation would hit
11 percent, stocks rebounded moderately at the end of trading.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index closed 15.61
points, or 0.9 percent, higher at 1,822.64 after sinking nearly 50
points earlier in the day.

Customs workers threatened as fuel crunch deepens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Customs workers came under intense
pressure Friday to end a strike that has dried up fuel supplies,
crippled transport and left many Greeks without heating oil as a
cold wave hit.
	   The walkout, which began Monday, was declared illegal by a court
Friday _ the second such ruling this week. Meanwhile, a public
prosecutor ordered the arrest of strikers preventing the transport
of fuel already processed by customs.
	   The main customs workers' union, striking against government
social insurance fund reforms, was due to meet later Friday to
consider calling off the protest following the court decision.
	   The government has warned it could declare a national emergency
and demand the workers return to their posts or face arrest.
	   Most of Greece's gasoline and heating oil arrives in Greece via
non-European Union nations. Goods shipped from EU partners are not
affected by the strike.
	   The customs protest added to the misery caused by a broad array
of strikes against government belt-tightening measures designed to
earn Greece a spot in the European Union's single currency group by
2001.
	   The customs walkout has left cars without fuel, trucks stranded
at the border and even forced the closure Friday of the main
landfill serving greater Athens. Temperatures have fallen to near
freezing in some mountainous parts of northern Greece.
	   In Athens, the fuel crunch had one positive result: easing the
city's chronic traffic jams.

Muslim mobs burn Christian church in Indonesia

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Cheering Muslim mobs on Friday burned
a Roman Catholic church in a provincial capital in the latest
outburst of religious violence in Indonesia.
	   At first, thousands of rioters blocked fire trucks from reaching
the church in the capital of South Sulawesi province, 840 miles
(1,350 kilometers) east of Jakarta.
	   The trucks eventually made it through but the church and two
houses were gutted, said Muhamad Adam, a fire brigade official.
	   Police and soldiers patrolled the area after the mobs dispersed.
There were no reports of injuries or arrests.
	   Police said that as night fell security personnel were guarding
other churches in the predominately Muslim city of 750,000.
	   Witnesses said mobs left neighboring mosques after Friday
Islamic prayers and set fire to the suburban Kare Catholic Church.
	   Many of the city's Christians are ethnic Chinese, who are often
targeted when social unrest flares because of their relative
wealth. Residents said most Chinese shops in the city were shut
Friday.
	   Last week, Christian rioters in the city of Kupang, southeast of
Jakarta, burned and ransacked 15 mosques in retaliation for the
Nov. 22 burning of churches in Jakarta.
	   Police said 22 churches had been attacked in the capital,
including four that were burned.
	   Witnesses in Ujungpandang said about 400 Muslims, who arrived
from Kupang after the mosque burnings there, marched through its
streets calling for more churches to be destroyed.
	   ``We really don't know what will happen in the next few days,''
said one resident who identified himself by the single name of
Chairul.
	   On Thursday, a man reported to be mentally ill set three mosques
afire in Ngabang, on Borneo island, 810 kilometers (500 miles)
north of Jakarta.
	   The violence has raised fears that revenge attacks on places of
worship could escalate in the world's most populous Muslim nation.
	   Ninety percent of Indonesia's 200 million people are Muslim,
with the rest belonging to Christian, Buddhist and other faiths.
	   Religious diversity based on a belief in God is enshrined in the
national philosophy, known as Pancasila, adopted when Indonesia
declared independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945.
	   But social tensions, fueled by widespread unemployment, have
intensified in Indonesia amid the worst economic crisis in decades.
	   The attacks come despite repeated calls for calm by Indonesian
President B.J. Habibie as well as Muslim and Christian religious
leaders.

World Court won't wade into Spain-Canada fishing dispute

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The World Court said Friday it
won't wade into a fisheries dispute between Canada and Spain
sparked by the Canadians' dramatic high-seas seizure of a Spanish
trawler in 1995.
	   By a vote of 12 to 5, the United Nations' highest judicial body
said it lacks the authority to get involved in the case, which
Spain brought against Canada, because the two countries disagree on
the basis for their dispute.
	   ``The court consequently has no jurisdiction to deal with the
merits of the case,'' the judges said. There was no immediate
reaction.
	   The tussle was triggered by the highly publicized seizure of the
Spanish trawler Estai in international waters by Canadian officials
in March 1995. The Canadians had fired warning shots and arrested
the Estai's captain.
	   Spain claims the incident, which occurred in the Grand Banks off
Newfoundland, violated international laws which protect freedom of
navigation and freedom of fishing on the high seas. It has accused
Canada of ``armed coercion.''
	   The Estai was also flying the Spanish flag, which meant it was
under Spanish and not Canadian jurisdiction, Madrid contends. It
has demanded unspecified compensation.
	   Canada contends the boat was fishing for endangered turbot, was
using small-mesh gear and was underreporting its catch.
	   Canadian authorities made the arrest based on the Canadian
Coastal Fisheries Protection Act of 1994, which gives officials the
power to manage fish stocks in areas that straddle international
boundaries.
	   Friday's ruling was sure to please Canada, which argued in
initial public hearings in June that the U.N. court lacked the
authority to get involved.
	   The World Court, officially known as the International Court of
Justice, has no enforcement powers and relies on states to comply
voluntarily with its rulings.

Palestinian police arrest student who took soldier's weapon

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ A Palestinian university student who
participated in an attack on an Israeli soldier and seized his M-16
assault rifle has been arrested, a senior Palestinian official said
Friday.
	   The rifle was handed over to the governor of the West Bank town
of Ramallah, Mustafa Issa, on Wednesday night, several hours after
about a dozen Palestinians pelted an Israeli car with stones,
pulled the soldier out of the vehicle and struck him repeatedly in
the head with rocks.
	   The soldier escaped with head injuries. The incident, captured
by TV cameras, triggered an outrage in Israel and led to Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to suspend the upcoming West
Bank troop withdrawal.
	   The Palestinian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the M-16 was handed over by Palestinian university students
not involved in the attack on the soldier.
	   One of the students was held for questioning, however, and later
the student who had seized the M-16 was arrested.
	   Israel and the Palestinians have blamed each other for the
violence, which came days before U.S. President Bill Clinton was to
arrive in the region to usher in the second stage of the Wye River
land-for-security agreement.

Israeli spokesman saying that to his knowledge talks are not

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Unofficial talks on the Middle East
peace process were held in the Swedish capital beginning in 1994 in
hopes of building on the agreements worked out in the secret ``Oslo
Channel'' talks, officials said Friday.
	   Shlomo Morgan, a spokesman for the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm,
said the talks had included mostly academics, and were supported by
Yossi Beilin, a leader of the Labour Party, which was in government
when the talks begam but is now in opposition.
	   Morgan said that, to his knowledge, no talks had taken place
recently. Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh was quoted by the
Swedish news agency TT as saying that ''talks have taken place with
a certain regularity.''
	   ''They hang together _ the Oslo process and these talks,'' she
said, referring to the secret negotiations in the Norwegian capital
that resulted in the historic Israel-PLO peace agreement.
	   ``Nevertheless, I can't point to any specific results'' from the
Stockholm talks, Lindh was quoted as saying.
	   Morgan, the Israeli spokesman, said one of the results was a
non-binding proposal, which had been published in the Israeli
press, for a Palestinian capital to be established in a village
near Jerusalem rather than in the city itself.
	   The speaker of the Palestinian legislative assembly, Ahmed
Qureia, contributed to that proposal, Morgan said.
	   Confirmation of the Stockholm talks came a day before
Palestinian Yasser Arafat was scheduled to visit. The trip
officially is to attend a meeting marking the 10th anniversary of
Arafat's statement in Stockholm recognizing Israel's right to
exist.
	   However, expectations are high that Arafat may use the occasion
to make a major policy speech outlining his vision for a permanent
Middle East peace.

Asian mayors discuss how to cope with urban growth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CEBU CITY, Philippines (AP) _ Mayors from 10 Asian cities,
gathered in the Philippines to exchange ideas on urban problems,
have decided that money isn't always the solution.
	   At the two-week workshop ending Friday, Naved Hamid, a senior
strategy and policy officer of the Asian Development Bank, said the
solution to better city administration often is not financial.
	   ``It could be a minor change in public organization and
cooperation,'' he said.
	   Mayors heard how Calcutta disposes of 60 percent of its solid
waste by turning it into organic fertilizer through composts.
	   The Shanghai government, on the other hand, invested billions of
dollars in an incinerator, but some environmentalists criticize the
method.
	   Hamid said the garbage problem can sometimes be solved simply by
enforcing anti-littering laws.
	   The city of Perth, Australia, was able to halve its garbage
through better education, he said.
	   The workshop, organized by the Asian Development Bank, also
covered public grievance resolution, property taxes, parking
regulations, policies on street vendors and traffic management.
	   The workshop participants included the mayors of Cebu; Shanghai,
China; Bangalore, India; Bandung, Semarang and Surabaya in
Indonesia; Kuantan, Malaysia; Lahore and Peshawar in Pakistan and
Colombo, Sri Lanka.
	   Asad Ali Shah, the ADB's manager for water supply, urban
development and housing, said these cities' combined population is
expected to nearly double from the present 1.5 billion to 2.6
billion by 2020.
	   ``This is a challenge to government officials,'' Shah said.

Ex-Tamil guerrilla guns down seven family members
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Police and soldiers are searching the
jungles for a former Tamil guerrilla who gunned down seven members
of his family during an argument in eastern Sri Lanka, a newspaper
reported Friday.
	   Somalingam Balasubramaniam, 28, grabbed an assault rifle and
killed his in-laws, two uncles, two aunts and a 10-year-old nephew
on Thursday in Eravur, the Observer newspaper reported.
	   He then fled with his wife and six-year-old son, taking the
rifle with him, the newspaper said.
	   Neighbors heard Balasubramanian arguing with his family, but did
not know what it was about, the paper said.
	   The area is 210 kilometers (130 miles) east of the capital,
Colombo.
	   Balasubramaniam is a member of the People's Liberation
Organization of Tamil Eelam. The group was among the many guerrilla
groups that fought for a homeland for the country's Tamil
minorities. In 1987, it accepted a compromise and joined the
political mainstream, along with five other groups.
	   One other group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, is still
battling government troops.
	   Former militants, such as Balasubramaniam, who are living in the
war zone are allowed to keep their weapons for self defense, since
they also help the military.
	   More than 56,000 people have been killed in the 16-year-old war.

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ In a show of determination to extend its
crackdown on dissent to cyberspace, China put a computer
entrepreneur on trial Friday on charges of giving e-mail addresses
to an Internet pro-democracy magazine.
	   Lin Hai went on trial in a closed courtroom on charges of
subversion for giving addresses of 30,000 Chinese computer users to
``VIP Reference,'' a journal published by Chinese dissidents in the
United States.
	   A defense lawyer said late Friday the trial had ended after
about four hours, and Lin was awaiting a verdict. He said it
probably would take the court a week to rule.
	   ``I'm afraid it doesn't look good for Lin Hai. I think he's
going to be found guilty,'' said lawyer Wang Wenjiang in a
telephone interview. He said he couldn't say what the sentence
might be.
	   The case marks a turning point in the Communist Party's attempt
to harness the Internet for economic development while stamping out
attempts to use it to spread dissent.
	   The trial also comes amid an intensifying campaign against
attempts to set up an opposition political party. Two prominent
democracy campaigners were arrested this week and accused with a
third dissident of endangering state security.
	   Lin's lawyers were allowed in court with him, but others
including his wife were barred. Xu Hong had said she planned to
wait outside the courthouse, but didn't arrive. She may have been
detained by police.
	   A man's voice shouted ``Hang up! Hang up!'' when Xu was reached
on her mobile telephone Friday, and the line went dead and
afterward was switched off. Ms. Xu had planned to provide foreign
reporters with details from Lin's lawyers.
	   Outside the court, about half a dozen uniformed police and other
plainclothes officers watched foreign reporters, and one person
videotaped them. Reporters were not allowed inside the court gate.
	   The court did not plan to announce the verdict publicly, said
court administrator Ni Jinlong.
	   Lin, the 30-year-old owner of a Shanghai software company, was
arrested in March and charged the next month with ``inciting the
overthrow of state power.''
	   China keeps close watch on the Internet. Special task forces
have been set up to monitor the system. Service providers are
required to register all users with the government and
technological barriers have been installed to try to block sites
deemed subversive or pornographic.
	   Reporters went to a neighborhood where Ms. Xu had been staying
in a semi-rural area on the outskirts of Shanghai, but neighbors
refused to show the way to her home. They would not say where Ms.
Xu was, or whether she had been detained.
	   Residents, including a man who identified himself as head of the
local security committee told the reporters to leave. A woman who
neighbors said was Lin's mother became angry when a photographer
took a picture of the lane and tried to wrestle away his camera.
	   When one man was asked whether police had warned residents not
to talk to reporters, he nodded his head yes.
	   Wang, the defense lawyer, said he would be trying Friday evening
to find out where Ms. Xu was.
	   The group Human Rights in China on Friday demanded Lin's release
and called the decision to put him on trial a ``blatant violation
of the right to freedom of expression.''
	   The group, based in New York, called his detention arbitrary and
noted the recent arrests of political activists.
	   ``These are a clear illustration that Beijing is taking no step
whatsoever in respecting fundamental human rights,'' the group's
executive director, Xiao Qiang, said in a statement.
	   He called China's recent signing of the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights an ``empty gesture.''
	   Xu, Lin's wife, says she has written to President Jiang Zemin
and Premier Zhu Rongji asking for their help but has received no
reply.

Yeltsin meets prime minister in hospital, no word on release

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yeltsin meeting Primakov in hospital. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin, who remains hospitalized
with pneumonia, met Friday with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
the Kremlin said.
	   No details of their meeting were immediately released, and
presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin wouldn't say when Yeltsin
will be discharged from the government hospital where he was
admitted on Nov. 22.
	   Other aides said this week that the president may return to work
at the Kremlin on Monday, but there was no sign that the president
was about to be released.
	   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, one of Russia's most prominent
politicians and a likely presidential candidate, said the
president's frequent ailments have weakened the government.
	   ``The president is ill indeed and he can work effectively only
for a small part of his working time,'' Luzhkov said in an
interview with Germany's ARD television on Thursday night. ``All of
us feel the absence of the president.''
	   However, ``even the fact that the president is in place is a
certain stabilizing factor for the society,'' Luzhkov said in
remarks that were also carried by the Interfax news agency. ``There
is no reason to see the president's health problem as equal to the
danger of the country's collapse.''
	   Yeltsin's bout of pneumonia is his second in as many years and
the latest in a string of illnesses that have eroded his authority
and raised doubts about his ability to serve out a term that ends
in 2000.
	   Ruslan Orekhov, head of the presidential legal department,
dismissed speculation that Yeltsin's was growing weaker and that
the president employs a machine, rather than his own hand, to sign
official documents.
	   ``The facsimile (machine) is never used on presidential
orders,'' Orekhov told the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda, adding that
it's only used on occasion to sign routine documents.
	   Orekhov also denied allegations that documents presented to
Yeltsin are typed in extra large letters to make them easier to
read.
	   At several public ceremonies, Yeltsin has signed documents in an
extremely slow and laborious manner, but Orekhov said this was
merely a personal habit, not a sign of his weakness.

Responding to crisis, Russia delivers food, fuel to needy areas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia launched operations Friday to bring food
and fuel to needy outposts in the far northeast, where the
country's economic crisis has made a hard life even harder for many
people.
	   More than 30 tons of food were delivered to three places in the
Chukotka Peninsula, including Wrangel Island, where three
filmmakers were airlifted to safety earlier in the week after they
ran out of food.
	   Villagers on the island have also been running low on supplies,
and a helicopter brought one ton of vegetables to the village of
Ushakovsky as part of a larger arctic airlift, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   A fuel tanker left the southeastern port of Nakhodka with more
than 15,000 tons of fuel that it was taking to two ports on the
Chukotka Peninsula, one of many places in the northeast where fuel
supplies have become critically low as a result of the economic
crisis.
	   ITAR-Tass said the tanker Samotlor is expected to reach the
ports of Egvenkinot and Providence in a week, but will have to wait
for an icebreaker to lead it into port.
	   In the southeastern territory of Primorsky, officials announced
a program to stockpile food reserves to protect people from the
effects of potentially steep price increases. Inflation is expected
to be over 70 percent this year.
	   In other signs of tough economic times:
	   _ Several hundred teachers in northern city of Arkhangelsk, who
have been on strike since Nov. 12, picketed the mayor's office and
city administration, demanding wages that haven't been paid for up
to five months, ITAR-Tass said.
	   _ Ambulance crews in the Ural Mountains city of Nizhny Tagil
held a two-hour warning strike during which they responded only to
extreme emergencies. They are demanding wages that haven't been
paid for four months.

South Korea, Thailand win, head their groups in Asian soccer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Choi Yung-soo scored twice Friday to
power South Korea into the second round with a 4-0 rout of Vietnam
in Asian Games soccer.
	   South Korea rebounded from a surprise 3-2 loss in the opening
game, in which it wasted a 2-0 lead against Turkmenistan.
	   South Korea, one of the favorites of the games soccer
tournament, ended with a 1-1 record in Group A behind Turkmenistan
in the 23-nation preliminary round.
	   It still qualified for the next round against the Group C
winner, Japan, in a battle Monday between future co-hosts of the
2002 World Cup.
	   Choi upped his goal count to four in two games with two more
goals after Kim Eun-jung started the scoring from the top of the
penalty area in the 30th minute.
	   Choi scored in the 42nd minute, making the score 2-0 at
halftime. After Yoon Jong-hwan scored in the 66th minute, Choi made
it 4-0 five minutes before the final whistle.
	   Japan had already clinched a second-round spot with two
victories in its matches against Nepal and India.
	   In another Friday game, host Thailand defeated Oman 2-0,
improving its mark to 2-0 in Group F. Both teams had already beaten
hapless Hong Kong and were certain to advance. The match decided
first and second place.
	   Worawoot Simaka put the Thais ahead in the 8th minute and
Tawatchai Damrong-Ongtrakul added an insurance goal in the 38th
minute.
	   The lead of Group F puts Thailand up against the Group H
runner-up, which is still to be decided in Saturday's game between
Iran and Laos.
	   In Group B, Jamal Taha scored twice as Lebanon beat Cambodia
5-1, taking second place behind China, which had beaten them both
in the opening matches.

Needles found in bread at supermarket
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Extortion is suspected in sewing needles found in
bread at a Japanese supermarket, police said Friday. No one was
injured by the 3.5-centimeter (1.4-inch) needles.
	   A 29-year old man found the needle Thursday inside bread bought
the previous day at the store, near the central Japanese city of
Nagoya, police said.
	   The supermarket had received a note earlier Thursday warning of
the tampering and demanding 5 million yen (dlrs 42,258), they said.
	   Authorities searched the store after business hours on Thursday
and found another needle in a stack of jeans on display.
	   A third needle turned up Friday in a slice of bread bought
Wednesday at the same store by a 54-year old woman.
	   Police have begun an investigation but no arrests have been
made.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's naval forces and its elite
Revolutionary Guards launched exercises in the Gulf Friday, Tehran
radio reported.
	   The five-day exercises began with defensive amphibious
operations and the shelling of targets by warships and air force
fighter-bombers, the radio said.
	   The 50,000 forces taking part also will practice mine-laying,
mine-sweeping, chemical attack scenarios, and air defense tactics
later in the week, the radio said.
	   The routine exercises are part of the dozens of drills carried
out through the year, and are not seen as a response to the recent
tensions in the region over Iraq's dispute with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   Iran's Gulf neighbors have grown accustomed to these exercises,
and officials statements before the latest maneuvers emphasized
their peaceful intentions.

Pirate CD merchants find safe haven at Greek university
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIMITRA KEHAGIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ Record stores awaiting the latest
release from popular Greek singer Giannis Parios watched in
frustration when it turned up first as a pirated compact disc at
Greece's largest university.
	   Sales of the bootleg CD were illegal _ but well-protected.
	   Rogue merchants are taking advantage of pro-democracy laws that
essentially bar police from Greek college campuses to offer pirated
music CDs, software and CD-ROMs with near impunity.
	   The crates and tables at the flea market-style bazaar at
Aristoleion University represent a small but highly visible part of
a booming trade in illegal CDs that has frustrated regulators and
music industry executives from the United States and European
Union.
	   The hub of the contraband production in Europe is formerly
communist Bulgaria, less than 50 miles from the port of Salonica.
The city has become an important EU foothold for the traffickers.
	   The unauthorized CDs are cheap and well-made, and they cost EU
music companies at least dlrs 200 million a year in lost sales,
according to the International Federation of the Phonographic
Industry, a trade group based in Brussels, Belgium.
	   U.S. officials have complained about copyright infractions and
have urged Greece to crack down on the traffickers, and customs
officers routinely seize pirated CDs.
	   Bulgarian authorities faced possible trade sanctions before they
took steps to squeeze the organized crime rings involved in the CD
piracy. In October, the interior ministry spokesman, Chavdar
Krumov, promised ``non-stop'' pressure on CD pirates.
	   But the merchants at Aristoleion feel little heat from police,
who can come no closer than the university's metal fence just
meters (yards) away from the open-air market.
	   ``Students do not really care whether something is legal or
not,'' said Giorgos Karanasios, a representative of one of the
student unions. ``If they can buy it cheaper, then it's worth it.''
	   The prices for the pirated CDs range from dlrs 7.15 to dlrs
10.70, compared to prices of up to dlrs 36 in stores. Shoppers
spend more than dlrs 3,570 on CDs and CD-ROMs each day at the
university, according to estimates.
	   ``The unlawfulness of this business is taken for granted,''
Karanasios said. ``But it is not up to us to stop it.''
	   Some trade groups have complained to prosecutors, but police
investigators may not enter the campus without permission from the
faculty council. Faculty are sensitive to the wishes of students
and rarely grant such clearance.
	   The police are hampered by a law enacted in response to a bloody
crackdown on student demonstrators in 1973 by the military regime
then in power. After democracy was restored in 1974, the new
government made university campuses off-limits to police.
	   The Union of Record Store Owners of Northern Greece and some
media reports claim that gangs with apparent links to Bulgarian CD
pirates oversee the Salonica market and pay students dlrs 36 a day
to peddle the recordings.
	   ``Without doubt ... those who control this business are not
students,'' said Irini Tsiliri, head of the Greek office of the
International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.
	   So far, there has been just one serious attempt to end the CD
sales at the university. Early this year, police received rare
permission to enter the campus. They confiscated more than 15,000
music CDs and CD-ROMs.
	   ``The retailers, however, soon came back,'' said Michalis
Papadopoulos, the university's dean.
	   Papadopoulos said he ``intends to take any further legal action
required to wipe out the black market that slanders the biggest
university in Greece.''

Top conservative quits leadership of Chirac's Gaullist party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A leading conservative politician said Friday he
will quit his leadership position in President Jacques Chirac's
party over a disagreement on European integration.
	   Former Interior Minister Charles Pasqua will leave the
leadership of the Rally for the Republic party because he disagrees
with the Amsterdam Treaty, one of the charters that governs
European integration, the Rally for the Republic (RPR) said.
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin signed the Amsterdam Treaty last
year. The National Assembly earlier this week approved a change to
France's constitution necessary for the treaty's implementation.
	   ``I cannot remain an advisor to the RPR while I disapprove of
the party's choices in such an important area,'' Pasqua said in an
interview published Friday in the daily Le Monde. He added that he
will not quit the party altogether.
	   Pasqua has long been skeptical about plans for European Union,
saying national sovereignty should not be compromised. He has also
urged fellow lawmakers to opposed the new euro single currency.

65-year-old Thai expects billiards gold at Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Besides being the oldest competitor in
the Asian Games, 65-year-old Mongol Kanfahklang figures he has a
good chance of becoming the oldest gold medalist as well.
	   His sport is billiards, never before included in the Asian
Games, and he is playing at home in Thailand.
	   The five-time Thai national champion is ranked second behind
India's Gif Sethi, whom he expects to meet in the gold medal match.
His chances also are considered good in the doubles event.
	   Mongol started playing billiards at age 9, but ``in my prime
years, I was afraid to travel abroad for competition because I had
a fear of heights and a fear of flying,'' he said. ``The symptoms
were only cured when I became older.''
	   He became a national team player in 1989, competing in the
Southeast Asian Games in the Philipines.
	   ``A gold at the Asian Games is my ultimate goal,'' he said.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Two public buses and a car crashed in
central Greece on Friday, and initial police reports said two
passengers were killed and 15 others were injured.
	   According to the reports, the crash occurred in heavy rain on a
mountain highway outside the port city of Itea, near the ancient
town of Delphi. Both buses were on provincial routes between some
of central Greece's smaller towns and villages.
	   Police said a car apparently crashed into one of the buses,
which was then rear-ended by the other.

Parliament passes first steps in Schroeder's agenda
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with vote, more quotes, date of upper house vote. &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Parliament's lower house Friday passed the
first steps in Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's center-left agenda, a
tax cut for low earners and more government money for families with
children.
	   Six weeks after taking power, the government alliance of Social
Democrats and Greens made good on two campaign pledges and passed
the measures against the votes of the conservative opposition,
328-220. Fifteen lawmakers abstained.
	   The measures are the first step in the the government's plans to
cut Germany's high tax burden on businesses and individuals by 15
billion marks (dlrs 9 billion). The reform is billed as one of
Schroeder's weapons against the No. 1 national problem:
unemployment.
	   Hannelore Roensch, from the opposition Christian Democrats,
called the new measures ``dishonest'' because they were sure to
lead to new tax increases in other areas to meet the government's
ultimate goal of controlling spending.
	   The two measures will cost the government 7.8 billion marks
(dlrs 4.67 billion.)
	   Earlier, the opposition failed with a motion to delay the debate
because Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine was on a trip to
Washington.
	   After weeks of wrangling over tax policy within the ruling
coalition, the center-right Christian Democrats accused the
government of ``chaos'' in its rush to fulfill promises for voters.
	   Parliament's upper house votes on the measures Dec. 18.
	   The law passed in the lower house Friday cuts the lowest
individual income tax bracket to 23.9 percent from 25.9 percent on
Jan. 1, which the government says will shave 1,700 marks (dlrs
1,020) off the average wage earner's tax bill next year. A cut in
the top tax rate is planned later.
	   The new government says it is reversing years of rising tax
burdens on low and medium earners under conservative former
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   ``Nurses, skilled manual laborers, industrial workers and
engineers cannot continue to be the pack mules of the nation,''
Social Democratic lawmaker Joachim Poss said.
	   Also under the new law, government aid to families is to rise by
30 marks (dlrs 18) to 250 marks (dlrs 150) per child on Jan. 1.
	   Mocking the government's haste, the opposition has called the
increase a ``Christmas present'' to voters.
	   ``We've kept our word,'' Poss countered. ``This proves how
determined and decisive the new government coalition is.''
	   Tax cuts were blocked under Kohl's government because the Social
Democrats, then in the opposition, held them up in the upper house
of parliament.

Congolese war increases demand for Rwandan, Ugandan beer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Thirsty soldiers fighting in Congo have
increased demand for Rwandan and Ugandan beer, helping the Rwandan
beer industry with the first export order since a 1994 genocide.
	   Celestin Mbahizimana, the sales manager in Bralirwa, the Rwandan
Breweries Ltd., said on Friday his company in December will export
4.2 million bottles of locally brewed Primus totaling 1 billion
Rwandan francs, or dlrs 3.3 million.
	   ``This is our first serious export since 1994,'' he said. ``But
Congo is a delicate market. We don't know what's going to happen
there tomorrow, so we're taking a step at a time.''
	   Rwandan economy was devastated by the 1994 Hutu
government-sponsored slaughter of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis
and politically moderate Hutus. The killing ended in July 1994 when
Tutsi-led rebels won power.
	   Rwanda and Uganda are both arming and fighting with Congolese
rebels who launched their revolt Aug. 2 against President Laurent
Kabila. The conflict in Africa's third largest nation has also
drawn in Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad fighting in support of
the government.
	   Uganda Breweries Ltd. said it had sold 10 million bottles in
November alone, much of which was taken to eastern Congo under
rebel control.
	   Bralirwa is 75 percent owned by Rwandan Standard Beer, 23
percent by Dutch Heineken and 2 percent by British Guiness. It
produces 600,000 hectoliters (gallons 15.6 million) of beer a year,
which is only half the capacity of the country's only brewery in
northwestern Gisenyi on the border with Congo.
	   Mbahizimana said the Congo export order, through five private
Rwandan companies, will bring the government desperately needed
revenues. Export tax on beer is 60 percent of the 2,900 Rwandan
francs (dlrs 9) per case of beer.
	   Under contract, Guiness cannot be exported outside Rwanda, and
orders for Heineken's Mutzig had been insufficient, Mbahizimana
said.
	   In remote southern Congo, a bottle of Primus last week sold for
an equivalent of dlrs 6.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian riot police clashed with
about 100 student protesters Friday, blocking them from marching on
the presidential palace to press for greater democracy.
	   Police used shields and batons to stop the advance of the
protesters, who fought back with punches and kicks.
	   The students pushed their way through one line of security
personnel, but were stopped by another about one kilometer (one
half mile) from the palace in central Jakarta.
	   No one was injured and no arrests were reported.
	   Another 300 student protesters also defied warnings from the
Southeast Asian nation's powerful military and staged a noisy but
peaceful street rally not far from the presidential palace.
	   Squads of troops and armored personnel carriers blocked the
students, many of whom were wearing brightly colored campus
jackets, as they marched to a busy intersection only a few hundred
meters (yards) from the palace complex near Jakarta's Chinatown.
	   They chanted anti-government slogans and called on the
government to accelerate and extend promised democratic reforms.
The students also demanded that former authoritarian President
Suharto face trial for alleged corruption.
	   Some handed flowers to the soldiers.
	   Friday's demonstrations were the latest in a series of almost
daily protests against Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie,
who announced Thursday that Parliamentary elections will be held on
June 7.
	   After the elections, Indonesia's highest legislative body, the
People's Consultative Assembly, was scheduled to convene next
August to select a new head of state.
	   Habibie has also promised to step up an ongoing investigation
into Suharto's wealth after abandoning a plan to set up a
commission of inquiry into the former leader's affairs.
	   On Wednesday, more than 1,500 students broke through what should
have been a tight security cordon and got to within a few meters
(yards) the ornate white-columned palace.
	   The military has warned students not to attempt to stage any
more demonstrations near the Dutch-built colonial mansion, but that
has failed to curtail the spread of protests in the capital.
	   ``Demonstrations around the palace are illegal,'' said Maj. Gen.
Suwandi, who is in charge of palace security.
	   On Nov. 13 soldiers shot nine students to death and injured
dozens more when protesters tried to march on Parliament.

	   Mbahizimana said the Congo export order, through five private
Rwandan companies, will bring the government desperately needed
revenues. Export tax on beer is 60 percent of the 2,900 Rwandan
francs (dlrs 9) per case of beer.
	   Under contract, Guiness cannot be exported outside Rwanda, and
orders for Heineken's Mutzig had been insufficient, Mbahizimana
said.

an equivalent of dlrs 6.

	   Here is a summary of news from The Associated Press. Stories
carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items below have
moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP) _ Space shuttle Endeavour and its
crew of six blazed a brilliant trail into orbit Friday, taking off
on the first construction flight of the international space
station. The entire sky flashed when Endeavour's boosters ignited
at 3:35 a.m. The shuttle shone like a bright star and was visible
for more than seven minutes as it sped out over the Atlantic and up
the East Coast. About one minute later, Endeavour was cruising in
orbit, bound for a Sunday rendezvous with the first space station
component launched by the Russians. The component had just passed
over Cape Canaveral when the shuttle blasted off. The full moon
gleamed as the chase began. Endeavour is carrying Part 2, an
American-built connecting passageway that the astronauts will
attach to the piece that preceded them into orbit by two weeks.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Facing U.S. criticism, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu told U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that he
has made no new demands of the Palestinians while suspending a West
Bank pullback, his senior adviser said Friday. An adviser to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, meanwhile, charged that Netanyahu
created the latest crisis in order to appease hard-liners and
strengthen his shaky coalition. Netanyahu suspended implementation
of the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians earlier
this week after complaining that Arafat systematically violated the
accord. The Israeli leader said he would only be satisfied by a
public declaration by Arafat that the Palestinians are dropping
plans to declare statehood in May and that they accept Israel's
criteria for the release of Palestinian prisoners. Albright spoke
to Netanyahu by phone on Thursday to discuss the latest crisis
which came just little more than a week before the arrival of U.S.
President Bill Clinton to the region. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Government investigators plan to
question former President Suharto next week over corruption
allegations and could place him under house arrest, officials said
Friday. ``We will question the former president at the Attorney
General's Office,'' the official Antara news agency quoted Attorney
General Andi Mohamad Ghalib as saying. Antara said Ghalib did not
specify the date of the questioning but stressed the investigation
into Suharto's wealth would be based on a presumption of innocence.
Meanwhile, State Secretary Akbar Tanjung repeated an earlier
warning that officials might place Suharto under house arrest if he
does not cooperate with the investigation. Suharto, who quit after
riots and protests in May, has denied any wrongdoing. He has stated
that he will cooperate with any inquiry. (INDONESIA-CORRUPTION)
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ In a show of determination to extend its
crackdown on dissent to cyberspace, China put a computer
entrepreneur on trial Friday on charges of giving e-mail addresses
to an Internet pro-democracy magazine. Lin Hai went on trial in a
closed courtroom on charges of subversion for giving addresses of
30,000 Chinese computer users to ``VIP Reference,'' a journal
published by Chinese dissidents in the United States. A defense
lawyer said late Friday the trial had ended after about four hours,
and Lin was awaiting a verdict. He said it probably would take the
court a week to rule. ``I'm afraid it doesn't look good for Lin
Hai. I think he's going to be found guilty,'' said lawyer Wang
Wenjiang in a telephone interview. He said he couldn't say what the
sentence might be. The case marks a turning point in the Communist
Party's attempt to harness the Internet for economic development
while stamping out attempts to use it to spread dissent.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ House Republicans are narrowing the focus of
their impeachment inquiry back to the Monica Lewinsky matter while
pressing the White House to name the witnesses who will defend
President Bill Clinton next week. Judiciary Committee Republicans
on Thursday granted the White House's request to review evidence of
possibly impeachable offenses. ``I hope this latest request by the
White House is not intended to delay the committee's proceedings,''
Chairman Henry Hyde, said in a statement. There was no letup in the
partisan squabbling that intensified this week when committee
Republicans first expanded their inquiry to include Clinton's
campaign finances. The Republicans reversed that move Thursday
after determining that secret Justice Department memos contained no
evidence of impeachable offenses. (US-CLINTON IMPEACHMENT)
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The man police believe terrorized
Australia with a letter-bombing campaign against tax collectors and
human rights officials was detained Friday in a hospital in
Canberra. Australian Federal Police launched a nationwide manhunt
Wednesday for 43-year-old Colin George Dunstan, a former Australian
Tax Office employee, after 22 parcel bombs were discovered at the
Canberra mail center, addressed mainly to tax office staff. Five
more potentially lethal bombs have been found in Sydney, Melbourne
and the Gold Coast. Australian Broadcasting Corp. said Dunstan had
apparently been hiding out at a motel near Canberra, and came to
the hospital on his own, before police arrived there.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1200 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets ended the week generally
higher Friday, but the key indexes fell both in Tokyo and Hong Kong
on the back of a sharp decline overnight on Wall Street. Tokyo's
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 57.11 points, or 0.39
percent, closing the week at 14,639.97 points. On Thursday, the
index had shed 289.54 points, or 1.93 percent. Japanese stock
prices fell in thin trading on selling of international blue chip
shares. The market is becoming ``very nervous about the American
economy,'' said Kazuo Takayama, chief foreign exchange manager at
Midland Bank in Tokyo. In New York Thursday, the Dow Jones
industrial average fell 184.86 points to 8,879.68. Meanwhile, the
U.S. dollar was quoted at 118.32 yen, down 0.91 yen from late
Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 118.60
yen overnight. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian ruble tumbled again Friday, trading at
about 20 to the U.S. dollar and threatening to hit its lowest point
since the country's economic crisis struck in August. The ruble's
latest slide is an ominous sign for the government, which
desperately wants to stabilize the economy as Russia heads into the
difficult winter months. With President Boris Yeltsin hospitalized,
and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov still struggling to implement a
recovery plan, the economy continues to founder and remains
vulnerable to additional shocks. The government is urgently seeking
foreign help, but International Monetary Fund chief Michel
Camdessus came and left this week without giving any signal that a
frozen loan package will be released soon. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Citibank transferred as much as dlrs 100
million in alleged drug money for the brother of a former Mexican
president without checking the source of the funds, a report for
Congress finds. The report by the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, criticized the nation's
second-largest bank for failing to follow its own procedures
against money laundering by not looking into the financial
background and source of the funds. Citibank ``facilitated a
money-managing system that disguised the origin, destination, and
beneficial owner of the funds,'' according to the report, set for
release Friday and cited in published accounts by The Washington
Post, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.
(US-CITIBANK-MONEY LAUNDERING)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Amid more gloomy news on the economy, Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa expressed doubt Friday that Japan will
achieve its economic target for this fiscal year. The comments came
a day after the government announced the Japanese economy had
shrunk at an annualized rate of 2.6 percent in the July-September
quarter. Miyazawa told reporters ``it will be a bit difficult'' to
achieve the government's target for a contraction of 1.8 percent
for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1999. In order to achieve that
target, Japan's real gross domestic product would have to expand by
0.7 percent in both the October-December and January-March
quarters, Miyazawa said. (JAPAN-ECONOMY)
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The World Court said Friday it
won't wade into a fisheries dispute between Canada and Spain
sparked by the Canadians' dramatic high-seas seizure of a Spanish
trawler in 1995. By a vote of 12 to 5, the United Nations' highest
judicial body said it lacks the authority to get involved in the
case, which Spain brought against Canada, because the two countries
disagree on the basis for their dispute. ``The court consequently
has no jurisdiction to deal with the merits of the case,'' the
judges said. The tussle was triggered by the highly publicized
seizure of the Spanish trawler Estai in international waters by
Canadian officials in March 1995. Spain claims the incident, which
occurred in the Grand Banks off Newfoundland, violated
international laws which protect freedom of navigation and freedom
of fishing on the high seas. It has demanded unspecified
compensation. (WORLD COURT-FISHERIES DISPUTE)

Russian ruble tumbles, inflation to top 70 percent this year

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian ruble tumbled again Friday, trading at
about 20 to the U.S. dollar and threatening to hit its lowest point
since the country's economic crisis struck in August.
	   The ruble's latest slide is an ominous sign for the government,
which desperately wants to stabilize the economy as Russia heads
into the difficult winter months.
	   With President Boris Yeltsin hospitalized, and Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov still struggling to implement a recovery plan, the
economy continues to founder and remains vulnerable to additional
shocks.
	   Primakov said the government would not attempt to fix the ruble
rate, and would continue to let dollars circulate freely in Russia.
He acknowledged that the crisis had left the government with few
good options.
	   ``The government has found it has less room to maneuver in these
conditions than it had a year or two ago,'' Primakov told a session
of the World Economic Forum in Moscow.
	   He blamed previous governments for the country's economic
turmoil and said a lack of stability, as well as the loss of
confidence in the country's future had jeopardized economic reform
efforts.
	   Primakov's government is urgently seeking foreign help, but
International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus came and left
this week without giving any signal that a frozen loan package will
be released soon.
	   With the country's financial markets essentially wiped out by
the economic crisis, the value of the ruble is one of the leading
indicators of economic confidence, and it is again on the decline.
	   After stabilizing temporarily at about 16 to the dollar, it has
been falling in recent days. The official rate was down from 18.8
on Thursday to 19.6 on Friday, and in street trading it took more
than 20 rubles to purchase one U.S. dollar.
	   The ruble dipped below 20 to the dollar shortly after the
country's economic crisis hit in August before making a modest
comeback. The ruble was at about 6 to the dollar before the crisis.
	   Meanwhile, the government announced that inflation has gone up
more than 65 percent so far this year and is expected to top 70
percent by year's end.
	   Russian inflation had been coming down after years of soaring
prices and was expected to be in single digits this year until the
country's economic crisis hit.
	   If the government does not receive foreign assistance soon, it
is expected to start printing more rubles to pay off millions of
workers and pensioners who haven't received their money for months.
	   But the additional money is almost certain to push inflation
higher and would risk bringing back the hyperinflation that Russia
suffered during the early 1990s.
	   Russia's problems could get worse next year when its dlrs 17.5
billion dollar foreign debt falls due. Several officials have
already said the country won't be able to meet these payments and
have called for creditors to set new terms for payment.

Police mull curbs on beer sales at Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Police on Friday mulled curbing beer
sales at venues for the Asian Games following the arrest of half a
dozen fans who threw bottles on to the soccer pitch during a match
between home side Thailand and Hong Kong.
	   But police spokesman Maj. Gen. Chatchawan Suksomjit said it was
unlikely a formal ban would be issued to the Bangkok Asian Games
Organizing Committee or to brewer Carlsberg, which is paying dlrs
10 million to sponsor the financially troubled regional
Olympic-style event.
	   ``Drinking liquor is not against the law in Thailand, not until
they create problems,'' Chatchawan said. ``So we cannot ban it, but
we will ask for cooperation from liquor companies and retailers not
to offer it in or near the venues.''
	   The newspaper Bangkok Post cited a spokesman for the brewer,
Thanit Thammasakhati, as saying beer sales were normal at sports
venues worldwide and suggesting a rival could have caused
Wednesday's disturbances to discredit Carlsberg.

Bad blood rising over Northern Ireland's troubled agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, both angry after Protestant
politicians retreated from an apparent deal, on Friday discussed
the mounting sense of crisis besetting Northern Ireland's peace
agreement.
	   David Trimble, meanwhile, jetted off to Washington the day after
his Ulster Unionist Party, main representative of the north's
British Protestant majority, said its divided members might take
weeks to support the next steps forward in making April's accord a
reality.
	   In dispute is the number of departments to be created in
Northern Ireland's new multi-party administration, and what kind of
joint policy-making committees that new government should form with
Ahern's government in the Irish Republic.
	   The British and Irish governments had expected both planks of
the accord to have been formed by October. And the north's Catholic
politicians thought they had reached agreement with the Ulster
Unionists on both points early Thursday _ to create 10
administration posts and seven cross-border committees _ when
British Prime Minister Tony Blair made a special trip to Belfast.
	   Instead, the Ulster Unionists announced no final deal had been
reached, and probably wouldn't be until after Trimble returns from
Oslo, Norway, where on Tuesday he and Catholic politician John Hume
will share this year's Nobel Peace Prize.
	   Ahern admitted he now feared neither plank would be agreed until
January at least. ``Something clearly went wrong _ precisely what I
cannot be sure of,'' he said ahead of his meeting with Adams, whose
Irish Republican Army-allied party expects two posts in the new
administration. Trimble says Sinn Fein won't be eligible unless the
IRA starts disarming.
	   Continued stalemate into January would increase the risk of
missing yet another target in the accord: the British government's
intention to hand over some powers to the new Northern Ireland
government in February.
	   Compounding this political tension, Protestant hard-liners in
bitterly divided Portadown vowed Friday to march through the town's
hostile Catholic area by Christmas.
	   Protestants have mounted sporadic protests on the periphery of
Portadown's Catholic enclave since July, when British authorities
blocked an annual Orange Order march that normally goes past
Catholic homes beside the town's Garvaghy Road.
	   Yearly confrontations over which side's rights should prevail in
Portadown has triggered widespread rioting for the past three
Julys. This year it climaxed with a firebomb attack on a home that
killed three Catholic boys. But smaller confrontations between
Protestants and police have continued.
	   Overnight, a 1,000-strong crowd skirmished with police in the
pastures where the July march was blocked. Ten officers suffered
minor wounds from thrown bottles, rocks, bricks and firecrackers,
while four Protestants were treated in the local hospital.
	   Portadown members of the Orange Order, Northern Ireland's
once-dominant Protestant fraternal group, blamed police for the
violence.
	   ``We want to get down the road in 1998 and we are determined,''
said David Jones, the Portadown spokesman for the Orange Order.
``Unless we are allowed to parade, we will be there Christmas Eve
and Christmas Day and New Year's Eve and New Year's Day.
	   ``If we don't walk it before Christmas,'' Jones said, ``then we
will walk it twice next year.''

65-year-old Thai expects billiards gold at Asian Games

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Besides being the oldest competitor in
the Asian Games, 65-year-old Mongol Kanfahklang figures he has a
good chance of becoming the oldest gold medalist as well.
	   His sport is billiards, never before included in the Asian
Games, and he is playing at home in Thailand.
	   The five-time Thai national champion is ranked second behind
India's Gett Sethi, whom he expects to meet in the gold medal
match. His chances also are considered good in the doubles event.
	   Mongol started playing billiards at age 9, but ``in my prime
years, I was afraid to travel abroad for competition because I had
a fear of heights and a fear of flying,'' he said. ``The symptoms
were only cured when I became older.''
	   He became a national team player in 1989, competing in the
Southeast Asian Games in the Philipines.
	   ``A gold at the Asian Games is my ultimate goal,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A lawyer for Malaysia's sacked
deputy prime minister accused prosecutors Friday of instructing a
key witness what to say in his client's corruption and sexual
misconduct trial.
	   Azizan Abu Bakar, who testified that Anwar Ibrahim had
repeatedly sodomized him, faltered during cross-examination,
prompting prosecution lawyers to rush to his aid.
	   Christopher Fernando, one of Anwar's nine lawyers, responded
with anger.
	   ``The answer is being given to the witness,'' he complained
angrily to the trial judge, Augustine Paul.
	   Prosecutor Abdul Gani Patail, peeved at being interrupted,
shouted back: ``Let me finish.''
	   Tempers flared when Fernando repeatedly asked Azizan, a former
chauffeur for Anwar's family, why he was giving contradictory
answers about waiting five years to make his accusations against
Anwar public.
	   Anwar, 51, has said he is innocent of all charges.
	   Prosecutors are trying to prove Anwar abused his powers by
forcing police to obtain retractions from Azizan and Ummi Hafilda
Ali, the sister of his former secretary, allegedly to cover up his
sexual trysts.
	   Ummi Hafilda, whom Azizan says convinced him to make the
allegations public in 1997, has accused Anwar of having sex with
her brother's wife.
	   The two people's accusations form the backbone of the
prosecution case and the 10 charges of corruption and illegal sex
against Anwar.
	   ``I had intended to tell certain parties before, but I was
confident that no one would believe that Anwar sodomized me,''
Azizan said.
	   Fernando accused him of ``lying brazenly'' to the court. ``You
are not able to explain this contradiction despite having been
given the opportunity,'' Fernando said.
	   Azizan insisted he was not lying. ``As a Muslim it would be
apostasy for me to fictionalize my account and permit a leader who
is a sodomizer to become a prime minister.''
	   Anwar was arrested on Sept. 20. The first trial involves four
counts of corruption. He will be tried later on one more corruption
charge and five charges of illegal sex.
	   Since Azizan took the stand two days ago, he has insisted he was
sodomized by Anwar. However, he also told the court that he went to
Anwar's house in August 1997 to seek his apology just weeks after
accusing him.
	   ``When Anwar scolded me, I asked him to forgive me,'' Azizan
testified. ``I said to Anwar, please forgive me because I was
involved in such activity.''
	   Azizan also reiterated that he wasn't promised a plum job and
directorships in companies in exchange for accusing his former
boss.
	   After the hearing ended, Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, carried a
cake with candles into the courtroom so Anwar could celebrate the
birthday of their daughter, Nurul Iman.
	   The icing on the cake said: ``Reformasi Girl, 11.''
``Reformasi'' means ``reform.''
	   Later in the afternoon, hundreds of lawyers in black robes
marched to a courthouse in solidarity for one of Anwar's lawyers,
who faces three months imprisonment for contempt of court in the
trial.
	   Several dozen pro-Anwar activists joined the lawyers as they
shouted, ``We want justice,'' in front of the federal courthouse.
	   Zainur Zakaria won a temporary reprieve when a three-judge bench
stayed his imprisonment until his appeal was heard. No date was
fixed for the appeal.

Hard-liner: All Americans traveling to Iran are suspicious
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A senior hard-line cleric on Friday said all
American who come to Iran should be viewed with suspicion, and
demanded explanation from officials who allowed a recent visit by
13 Americans who were attacked by radical youths.
	   Addressing worshipers at Friday prayers in Tehran, Ayatollah
Ahmad Jannati disputed a government statement that the Americans
were businessmen looking for investment opportunities. He said they
were not even tourists
	   ``They held a series of meetings that made no sense for tourists
or businessmen,'' Jannati said. ``When suspicious individuals come
into the country, this opens the way for spies.''
	   The Americans, while traveling in a bus in Tehran Nov. 21, were
attacked by stone-throwing, stick-wielding radicals after hard-line
newspapers claimed the visitors were spies. The Americans left Iran
after the attack.
	   ``Any Americans who come to Iran should be viewed with
suspicion,'' said Jannati.
	   ``We must be very cautious about allowing even Americans who
come as tourists to Iran,'' said Jannati, the secretary of the
Guardian Council, a powerful body that watches over Parliament.
	   U.S. officials have denied that the Americans were government
officials or had links to the Central Intelligence Agency.
	   Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, who leads the moderate
faction in the ruling clergy, condemned the attack, saying the
Americans had valid visas and were entitled to Iranian hospitality
and protection.
	   The events reflect the fierce opposition Khatami faces from
conservative clerics as he tries to open the country to the outside
world and loosen the social and political restrictions imposed by
the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
	   The United States severed ties with Iran after Muslim militants
seized the U.S. Embassy in Iran during the revolution.
	   Even though hard-liners look at the United States with deep
suspicion, the number of American visitors to Iran has grown
rapidly after Khatami called for cultural exchanges between the two
countries earlier this year.
	   Last week, the Foreign Ministry said the visit by the 13
Americans was encouraged to increase pressure against U.S.
sanctions that ban American companies from investing in Iran.
	   Jannati said that officials who had allowed the Americans should
come forward.
	   ``The people want answers. They want to know what kind of visa
was issued to the Americans ... what kinds of meeting they held and
the purpose of the meetings. They want to know who hosted the
visit,'' Jannati said.
	   ``We will always remain pessimistic toward the United States.
That cannot change,'' he said.

France, Britain agree that Europe needs independent defense
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from joint statement at end of summit,

conference. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-MALO, France (AP) _ France and Britain on Friday agreed
the European Union needs a stronger, more independent defense
policy to help it react more effectively to international crises
and counterbalance U.S. power.
	   ``The European Union should have the ability to act
independently, with credible military forces, and with the means to
use them to respond to international crises,'' British and French
leaders said in a joint statement.
	   Earlier Friday, Defense Ministers Alain Richard of France and
George Robertson of Britain, meeting aboard two frigates, signed an
agreement that would allow for greater cooperation in crisis
management and military operations.
	   French President Jacques Chirac, French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin and British Prime Minister Tony Blair concluded their
agreement on European defense at the end of a two-day summit in the
Brittany port town of Saint-Malo.
	   Europe must ``make itself heard in world affairs, while at the
same time respecting obligations within NATO,'' the joint statement
said.
	   The EU is sensitive to criticism that it reacts too slowly and
in disjointed fashion to crises such as Kosovo, forcing the United
States to take the lead in resolving continental conflicts.
	   France has been pushing for an independent European defense,
starting with a European pillar within NATO. But Britain has said
NATO must remain the cornerstone of defense and security.
	   Topics on the agenda also included EU tax levels, small
business, and cooperation in Africa, where both countries have
former colonies.
	   But defense and security dominated the meeting.
	   Blair was accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott,
Chancellor Gordon Brown, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and Defense
Secretary Robertson.
	   France was also represented by Defense Minister Richard and
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine.
	   Britain and France, both nuclear powers and U.N. Security
Council members, traditionally have been at odds over the role of
the European Union.
	   But both now recognize the need for Europe to cope militarily
when the United States does not get involved in crises.
	   Paris and London have stressed there are no plans yet to abolish
the Western European Union, the EU's fledgling defense arm, or to
merge it into the European Union.
	   The summit comes follows a Franco-German summit earlier this
week in Potsdam.
	   French officials say the summit, unprecedented in terms of the
number of officials attending, is the result of a change in British
policy toward the EU since Blair's Labor Party took over from the
Conservative Party in May 1997.

World Court won't hear Spain-Canada fishing dispute

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The World Court said Friday it
won't wade into a fisheries dispute between Canada and Spain
sparked by the Canadians' dramatic high-seas seizure of a Spanish
trawler in 1995.
	   By a vote of 12 to 5, the United Nations' highest judicial body
said it lacks the jurisdiction to get involved in the case, which
Spain brought against Canada. Its ruling effectively ends the case.
	   In its judgment, the court noted that both sides didn't even
agree on the subject of their dispute.
	   Spain contends it boiled down to issues of sovereignty on the
high seas. For Canada, the row had more to do with the adoption of
drastic measures to protect depleted fish stocks.
	   Canada had argued from the beginning that the court lacked the
authority to get involved. Its agent, Philippe Kirsch, described
Friday's ruling as ``a vindication.''
	   ``We believe that such disputes lend themselves better to
negotiation than litigation,'' he said.
	   Kirsch said the dispute was already settled to a large extent in
1995 between Canada and the European Union, which includes Spain.
	   Spain's agent, Aurelio Perez Giralda, was clearly disappointed.
	   ``This hasn't solved the merits of the case,'' he said. ``They
ruled only on jurisdiction. It was a very technical decision based
on some words.''
	   The tussle was triggered by the highly publicized seizure of the
Spanish trawler Estai in international waters by Canadian officials
in March 1995. The Canadians had fired warning shots and arrested
the Estai's captain. Part of the ship's catch was also confiscated.
	   Spain claims the incident, which occurred in the Grand Banks off
Newfoundland, violated international laws which protect freedom of
navigation and freedom of fishing on the high seas. It accused
Canada of ``armed coercion.''
	   The Estai was also flying the Spanish flag, which meant it was
under Spanish and not Canadian jurisdiction, Madrid contended. It
demanded unspecified compensation.
	   Canada contends the boat was fishing for endangered turbot, was
using small-mesh gear and was underreporting its catch.
	   Canadian authorities made the arrest based on the Canadian
Coastal Fisheries Protection Act of 1994, which gives officials the
power to manage fish stocks in areas that straddle international
boundaries.
	   Canada said the court lacked jurisdiction in arguments arising
from fishing in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization's
regulatory area.
	   The World Court, officially known as the International Court of
Justice, has no enforcement powers and relies on states to comply
voluntarily with its rulings.

Eight Muslims charged with attacking Croats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Eight Muslims have been
charged with attacks on Croats and their property in the central
town of Bugojno, the daily Dnevni Avaz reported Friday.
	   The report did not specify a trial date for the eight.
Muslim-dominated Bugojno, some 80 kilometers (50 miles) west of
Sarajevo remains tense four years after the end of Muslim-Croat
hostilities in 1994.
	   The eight are accused of blowing up Bosnian Croat houses and
attacking local Croats. All are in custody.

Parliament urges Moscow city to restore statue of dreaded police
</HEADLINE>
chief &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Parliament's lower house on Wednesday gave final
approval to a resolution calling on the Moscow city government to
resurrect a statue of the infamous Soviet secret police chief Felix
Dzerzhinsky.
	   The Communist-dominated State Duma voted 255-102 to urge the
city officials to return the statue of Dzerzhinsky to the spot it
occupied for decades on the Lubyanka Square in front of the old KGB
headquarters. They said it would be a ``symbol of the fight against
crime in Russia.''
	   But Grigory Yavlinsky, head of the liberal Yabloko faction, said
Dzerzhinsky symbolized ruthless political repression, and the
resolution showed that today's Communists had not changed their
attitudes from the Soviet era.
	   ``It's now clear that all Communist talk about being a new,
reformed party is a cynical lie,'' Yavlinsky said on Echo Moscow
radio.
	   ``If they come to power in Russia, they would use the same
methods this man (Dzerzhinsky) used _ physical extermination of
their opponents. Their ideal of justice is summary executions in
the basements.''
	   The Duma's resolution is non-binding, and the city legislative
must approve all decisions on monuments.
	   The Communists are the leading faction in parliament, but are
much less influential in the Moscow city parliament, which may
block the move to restore the statue.
	   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov hasn't yet commented on the Duma's
move. Luzhkov, a leading presidential hopeful, has often criticized
the Communists.
	   The towering bronze statue of ``Iron Felix,'' head of the first
secret police organization in the Soviet era, was a major Moscow
landmark during Soviet times.
	   It was toppled by pro-democracy protesters in 1991 and has since
languished with other Soviet-era statues in a city park.
	   The statue stood on Lubyanka Square, and human rights groups
have used the spot in recent years to hold vigils to honor the
millions of victims of Soviet repressions.
	   Yabloko suggested on Friday that a monument to victims be put on
Lubyanka instead of Dzerzhinsky's statue, but the proposal failed
to pass.
	   Yabloko members also proposed an end to the state financing of
Vladimir Lenin's embalmed body and his mausoleum on Red Square. But
the motion was overwhelmingly defeated.
	   Yuri Nikiforenko, a Communist lawmaker, assailed Yabloko for
trying to block a ``scientific experiment to preserve Lenin's
body.''
	   Oleg Morozov, the leader of a moderate Russia's Regions faction,
urged his colleagues to stop ``trying to rewrite history.''
	   ``This political necrophilia isn't improving the image of our
parliament,'' he said.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The main labor federation began legal
action against a ban on national strikes imposed by President
Robert Mugabe, the labor group said.
	   The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, organizers of national
strikes that shut down the economy for two days in November, said
it filed affidavits Thursday seeking the ban be declared
unconstitutional by the nation's highest court.
	   ``The president exceeded his powers,'' said Morgan Tsvangirai,
the federation's secretary-general.
	   The documents argue Mugabe breached conditions in the
constitution, including those on free speech and freedom of
movement.
	   The Supreme Court goes into Christmas recess next week, but
lawyers for the federation said it was demanding a special hearing
allowed under the law to consider urgent constitutional issues.
	   --
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ A Lebanese businessman and two
treasury officials have been convicted of stealing dlrs 1.7 million
from Ivorian state coffers and sentenced to 20 years behind bars.
	   Judge Attoube Koko on Thursday found the businessman, Richard
Nasra, guilty of fraud and embezzlement and ruled he would not be
eligible for parole. Nasra will also be required to pay back the
stolen money to the state.
	   Koko also handed down 20 year jail terms to treasury officials
Youma Toure and Silvere Kacou.
	   Treasury department chief Julien Bouadu, who has been jailed
since July in connection with the case, was released for lack of
evidence.
	   One of Nasra's lawyers, Bokola Alain complained the ruling was
unfair and said an appeal would be launched to the country's High
Court.
	   Nasra escaped custody in the Ivory Coast two years ago and fled
to France. He was extradited in May to a maximum security prison in
Abidjan.
	   --
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ The number of people with
physical handicaps as a result of Congo's 1997 civil war has
doubled to 500,000, mainly because of accidental explosions and
landmines, a government minister said.
	   Youth and Sports Minister Ernest Ndala said the number of people
with disabilities had risen from 250,000 since the war ended in
November 1997.
	   Many of these were amputees, having lost limbs in accidental
landmine, artillery shell and other explosions, Ndala said.
	   Calling on ``men of good will'' to assist in supporting
handicapped people, Ndala said the nation's centers for supplying
artificial limbs were desperately in need of funds.
	   --
	   DAR-ES-SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ More than 30 armed Congolese
government soldiers have crossed into western Tanzania since the
start of the rebellion in Congo on Aug. 2, a radio report said.
	   The soldiers entered into the Rukwa region of southwestern
Tanzania with 18 rifles, 1,858 rounds of ammunition and some
grenades, Radio Tanzania reported late Thursday.
	   The report, citing Rukwa Regional Administrative Secretary Haji
Kachechela, said the soldiers had fled the southeastern Congolese
towns of Moba and Kalemie, where they had been cut off from their
comrades during fighting with Congolese rebels.
	   Rwanda and Uganda have been backing the rebels, a coalition of
disaffected Congolese soldiers and politicians, who have been
fighting to topple Congolese President Laurent Kabila. Zimbabwe,
Angola, Namibia and Chad have sent troops and weapons to beef up
Kabila's forces.
	   Kachechela said that the soldiers who fled to Tanzania claim to
have been Congolese refugees recruited from refugee camps in
Western Tanzani to fight alongside forces loyal to President
Laurent Kabila.
	   Officials said between 120 and 170 civilian refugees from Congo
also cross into the Rukwa region daily.

Philippine Pacquiao snatches WBC flyweight crown from Chatchai
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao knocked
out Chatchai Sasakul in the eighth round Friday to snatch the World
Boxing Council flyweight crown.
	   Fifth-ranked challenger Pacquiao chased the Thai world champion
into the ropes and faked him out with a right jab. With about 20
second left in the round, he delivered a powerful left hook
directly to his opponent's jaw.
	   Chatchai crumpled to the canvas, then lifted himself on to all
fours, but fell flat again.
	   Pacquiao, 22, now has 24 wins, 15 by knockout, and one loss.
	   Chatchai, 28, who had not fought since defending his title
against South Korea's Young Soon-chang in May, fell to 33 wins,
including 22 knockouts, and two losses.
	   Chatchai reportedly was due for a mandatory bout against a
top-ranked contender. But his manager negotiated with the WBC for
the fight against Pacquiao instead.
	   Chatchai looked confident stepping into the ring, but Pacquiao
got aggressive in the third round.
	   By the seventh, he clearly had Chatchai on the run.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Police and soldiers are searching the
jungles for a former Tamil guerrilla who gunned down seven members
of his family during an argument in eastern Sri Lanka, a newspaper
reported Friday.
	   Somalingam Balasubramaniam, 28, grabbed an assault rifle and
killed his in-laws, two uncles, two aunts and a 10-year-old nephew
on Thursday in Eravur, the Observer newspaper reported.
	   He then fled with his wife and six-year-old son, taking the
rifle with him, the newspaper said.
	   Neighbors heard Balasubramaniam arguing with his family, but did
not know what it was about, the paper said.

McEnroe: players should give 10 percent of prize money to charity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ John McEnroe says money is ruining men's tennis,
turning players into greedy, multi-millionaires who give nothing
back to the game.
	   The former three-time Wimbledon champion says prize money should
be slashed _ with 10 percent donated to children's charities _ and
the number of tournaments reduced.
	   ``The main tour needs completely revamping,'' McEnroe said in
London, where he is playing in a seniors tournament. ``There is too
much money in the game, and the effort level among the players is
not high enough. They don't dig enough because they have too much
money.
	   ``I say we should take 10 percent of all prize money, both main
tour and seniors, and give it to charity _ and let some of those
multi-millionaire tennis players step up to the plate and do the
same. Do something good for the game for a change instead of for
themselves.''
	   McEnroe also criticized the crowded tennis calendar.
	   ``By the end of the year the players are all tired and
injured,'' he said. ``I know that if I was an alternate for the ATP
Tour Finals I would always show up because someone is bound to drop
out through injury. Look at (Marcelo) Rios and Andre (Agassi) last
week in Hanover. They pulled out, and (Greg) Rusedski got his
chance.''
	   McEnroe beat Guillermo Vilas 6-1, 6-4 on Thursday night in his
opening match of the ATP Seniors Tour event.

Liashenko, Plyushchenko lead after short programs

	   SAPPORO, Japan (AP) _ Elena Liashenko of Ukraine and ice dancers
Marina Anissina and Gwendal Feizerat of France were among the
leaders Friday in the NHK Trophy tournament.
	   A Russian winning streak still can't be counted out after the
day's three short programs and original dancing at the sixth and
final of the figure skating Champions Series.
	   Evgeny Plyushchenko took the lead in the men's singles. In the
pairs event Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze were also in
the lead ahead of American sister and brother, Dannielle Hartsell
and Steve Hartsell.
	   The 22-year-old Liashenko, winner of Skate Canada women's
singles in July, edged Russian Irina Slutskaya with a flawless
performance of jumps, spins, steps and spirals to receive scores
ranging from 5.4 to 5.6. Slutskaya got 4.9 to 5.4.
	   Uzbekistan's Tatyana Malinina was third, followed by Vanessa
Gusmeroli of France and Japan's Fumie Suguru.
	   With only Elena Sokolova and her Russian compatriot Maria
Butyrskaya definitely qualifying for the Champions Series final in
March, Liashenko is a top contender with 12 points from her victory
in Canada.
	   Suguri, on nine points from her second place in Canada, can also
qualify along with three skaters with seven points _ American
Angela Nikodinov, world silver medalist Slutskaya and 1997 world
bronze medalist Vanessa Gusmeroli of France.
	   On the Champions Series circuit, inaugurated three years ago,
skaters are allowed to compete in only three of the six events in a
season, taking two events to tally the points in order to be able
to compete in the series final.
	   For the final, the top six scorers in the men's and women's
singles, pairs and ice dancing events qualify.
	   So far this season, the Russians have won 14 of 20 titles even
without their Olympic champions, Ilia Kulik and Tora Lipinski,
competing.
	   In Skate America and Skate Canada, the Russians won four of the
eight events. They swept the titles in Nations Cup in Germany and
added two more at the Lalique Trophy competition in France. Like in
Germany, they swept all four in the Cup of Russia.
	   Kulik and some other big-name skaters have bypassed the
Champions Series this year, preferring to enter pro-ams and do the
show circuit while staying eligible for future Olympic competition.
	   ``Every now and then, one country could be doing better than
another. I don't think the Russian winning streak so far this year
is the beginning of any kind of dynasty,'' says Peter Oppegard, of
Los Angeles, California, who coaches Nikodinov.
	   In the men's singles, Li Chengjiang was second, followed by
Japan's Takeshi Honda and Ukraine's Evgeny Pliuta.
	   ``It was a performance of 70 percent,'' said Honda, who was
hospitalized for two nights because of a flu several days ago.
``But I'll jump a quadruple on Sunday.''
	   Honda, a 17-year-old high school student, is the only Japanese
who has attempted the jump in competition. Only three-time world
champion Elvis Stojko of Canada and a few other men have succeeded.

South Korean Kang Wook-soon leads after second round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ South Korean Kang Wook-soon fired a 5-under-par
65 Friday to take a three-stroke lead after the second round of the
U.S. dlrs 500,000 Omega PGA Championship.
	   Kang, who won the Hong Kong Golf Open last Sunday, shot six
birdies over the 6,096-yard Clear Bay Golf and Country Club for a
two-day total of 9-under-par 131.
	   Three strokes behind were Taiwan's Hsieh Chin-sheng, China's
Zhang Lianwei and Carlos Espinosa of Mexico. Hsieh carded a 64 on
Friday, while Zhang and Espinosa both had a 66.
	   Kang, who is favorite to win this year's Omega Order of Merit,
said he has fully recovered from the back injury he suffered at the
end of 1996.
	   ``I can't feel my injury at all now, and I am playing like I did
in 1996,'' he said.
	   Australian Paul Foley broke the course record after firing an
8-under-par 62 to finish in joint 5th place at 135 with three other
players, including compatriots Australians Adrian Percey and Brad
Andrews.
	   Percey shot a 65 on Friday and Andrews had a 66. Also on 135 was
South Korean Park No-seok, who carded a 66 on Friday.

Kosovo Albanians appeal for more help amid escalating violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Kosovo Albanians' political
leader pleaded anew for international military intervention Friday
after the worst breach of an informal cease-fire in the troubled
province.
	   Ibrahim Rugova's appeal came with Kosovo's de-facto truce under
dangerous new strain following the killings of 12 ethnic Albanians
in the previous two days, including eight shot by Yugoslav border
guards.
	   The escalating violence lends added urgency to American-led
diplomatic efforts to reach a political settlement on Kosovo's
status. A day after U.S. envoy Christopher Hill appealed to Serb
officials to accept a revised peace plan, U.S. State Department
officials presented the changes to ethnic Albanian officials Friday
in Kosovo's capital, Pristina.
	   Rugova had no immediate reaction to the revised plan, the
specifics of which were not released. But the Albanian leader
renewed his call for more international assistance in ending
hostilities in Kosovo, where dozens have died in sporadic clashes
since an Oct. 12 U.S.-brokered peace agreement.
	   ``NATO ground troop deployment would provide a greater sense of
security,'' he said at a news conference.
	   The 12 shooting deaths of ethnic Albanians since Wednesday is
``a sign that we need a special security force which will protect
citizens and stop violence in Kosovo,'' Rugova said.
	   A commander of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, meanwhile,
disputed the Yugoslav army's report that eight ethnic Albanians
shot dead Thursday near the Albanian border were guerrillas.
	   The commander, who gave his name as Sylemetaj, said in Velika
Krusa that the victims were refugees returning to that village in
southwestern Kosovo. Six were students and most were from a single
family clan, the Hotis, he said.
	   Western officials who visited the shooting site said it appeared
the Albanians had stumbled on the army unexpectedly, raising
questions about the army account that the victims were armed rebels
who had fired on them first.
	   The border shootings took place one day after three ethnic
Albanians were gunned down in their car in Pristina, killings the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army blamed on Serbia's secret police.
Another ethnic Albanian was shot dead Wednesday while traveling on
a main Kosovo road.
	   Retaliation by the KLA to those shootings would represent a
grave threat to the already-fragile de-facto truce.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is assembling a force of 2,000 unarmed international verifiers in
Kosovo, said the shooting incidents appeared unrelated and were
unlikely to ``represent a dramatic change in the security situation
in the short term.''
	   Hill is spearheading international efforts to get the Serbs and
Albanians to reach agreement on Kosovo's future status before the
tense Serbian province explodes in new fighting.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and up to 300,000 were left
homeless after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a
crackdown last February against rebels who demand independence for
Kosovo, which is populated overwhelmingly by ethnic Albanians.
	   Bloodshed abated _ but did not end _ after Milosevic agreed on a
cease-fire and promised U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke Oct. 12 to end
the Kosovo campaign and begin political negotiations.
	   Ethnic Albanians still insist on independence for Kosovo, while
Serbs reject any plan that would not keep it within Kosovo.
	   A proposal to give Kosovo some form of self-rule for an interim
period until a permanent solution can be found has gained backing
among both Rugova's moderate political bloc and the KLA in recent
days.
	   Rugova hailed the rebels' compromise.
	   ``If they agree to an interim stage, it will be a good thing,''
he told The Associated Press on Friday.
	   He said the ethnic Albanians' unified support for an interim
settlement represents a key concession in the interest of Kosovo's
future.
	   ``It's a sign we are ready to compromise to stop the violence
and make peace in Kosovo,'' Rugova said.

Ahead of Clinton visit, stepped up campaign to free prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Ahead of U.S. President Bill
Clinton's Mideast trip, some 2,500 Palestinian prisoners held by
Israel for anti-Israeli activities are launching an open-ended
hunger strike to press for their release, organizers said Friday.
	   The hunger strike, to begin Saturday, will be accompanied by
protest marches and commercial strikes, all aimed at sending a
message to Clinton that the Wye River peace agreement cannot
proceed until the dispute over the prisoners has been settled, said
Issa Karakeh, head of the Palestinian Prisoners' Association.
	   ``We want to show him (Clinton) that the prisoner issue is an
important one for the Palestinian people,'' Karakeh said.
	   Most Palestinian families have had a brother or father arrested
at one time during 30 years of Israeli occupation.
	   The criteria for prisoner releases have become a major point of
contention between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
	   The dispute has contributed to the latest crisis which
culminated in Israel's announcement this week that it would suspend
the next West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Palestinian negotiators have said that Clinton has promised
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in a meeting earlier this week
that he would do his utmost to resolve the issue.
	   Under the Wye River peace agreement, Israel agreed to free 750
Palestinian prisoners by the end of January and in a first stage
last month freed 250, most of them common criminals.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that most of the
so-called security prisoners did not fit his criteria for release.
	   Netanyahu has said he would not free those involved in attacks
that led to death or injury, or members of the Islamic militant
group Hamas.
	   Palestinian officials have said the pool of those eligible for
release, even under Netanyahu's rules, was much larger. They said
only 300 of the 2,500 were convicted of killing Israelis, and that
only about 1,250 were members of Islamic militant groups.
	   Two weeks ago, three Palestinian prisoners at Israel's Megiddo
began a hunger strike and were joined a week later by 125 inmates
at another facility.
	   On Saturday, all 2,500 prisoners will join in, Karakeh said. At
the same time, relatives of the prisoners will stage sit-ins in
tents to be set up in various West Bank towns and other groups will
stage protest marches. Commercial strikes are scheduled for
Wednesday and Monday, Dec. 14, the day Clinton visits Gaza.
	   The children of Palestinian prisoners will stage a candle light
vigil at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem on Dec. 15, the
day Clinton is expected to visit Jesus's traditional birthplace.

Demonstrators press ahead with protests in Ukrainian port city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEVASTOPOL, Ukraine (AP) _ Dozens of medical workers
demonstrated Friday for back wages at the main government building
in this port city, the latest in a series of almost daily protests
over the past two months.
	   The doctors, along with teachers and pensioners, are demanding
overdue money that has been delayed for more than a year in some
cases.
	   Demonstrators are also angry with energy problems that have left
residents without electricity and heat supplies for several hours
every day.
	   ``How are we supposed to live and work? What do the authorities
think they are doing?'' said Olena Shevelo, director of a
Sevastopol hospital.
	   ``Can you imagine the stress a doctor is subjected to when he
cannot even afford to pay transpiration fees to get to work?'' she
said.
	   During the Soviet era, Sevastopol enjoyed preferential status as
the home port for the former Soviet Black Sea Fleet, which is now
divided between Ukraine and Russia.
	   The continuing economic decline in both countries has left their
governments unable to finance many social needs, and support has
been cut sharply for Sevastopol and its naval bases.
	   Many of the 400,000 people in the city worked at enterprises
linked to the fleet.
	   ``The city today is in an extremely terrible state, and the
situation is such that it could even lead to spontaneous riots,''
said Sevastopol Mayor Vasyl Parkhomenko.
	   He said city authorities had warned the national government in
Kiev about the tense situation in Sevastopol, to little effect. The
city has received only 15 percent of the money it needs to cover
its energy bills and pay salaries, Parkhomenko said.

Turkish labor and trade groups back an Ecevit-led government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUZAN FRASER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's five largest labor and trade
confederations on Friday pressed political leaders to back
premier-designate Bulent Ecevit's efforts to form a new pro-secular
government.
	   ``The country needs political and economic stability today more
than ever,'' said a confederation leader Dervis Gunday.
	   The confederations last year brought out their rank-and-file in
mass demonstrations against an Islamic-led government which was
eventually forced to resign because of military pressure.
	   Veteran leftist politician Ecevit was asked to form a new
government Wednesday after the center-right secular coalition of
Mesut Yilmaz lost a no-confidence vote over a mafia scandal.
	   With not enough votes on his own, Ecevit needs to form an
alliance with two center-rights parties if he wants to exclude
Turkey's largest party, which is pro-Islamic.
	   On Friday, Yilmaz - who remains prime minister until the new
government is formed - met with the army top brass in a high
military council meeting that was expected to discuss the cases of
some 50 officers suspected of ties to radical Islam.
	   The military, which has asserted itself as the guarantor of
Turkey's secular traditions, has sacked hundreds of officers in the
last two years in a bid to rid the army ranks of alleged militant
Islamic tendencies.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Investigators said Friday they have
yet to find what caused a fire that destroyed an aging orphanage in
a Manila slum area, killing 25 children and five adults.
	   Several babies were among those who died in the pre-dawn fire
Thursday at the orphanage, built 85 years ago and run by a women's
organization in Manila's Paco district.
	   Pablito Cordeta, operations chief of the Manila Fire Department,
said the fire originated in the library on the second floor of the
mostly wooden building.
	   Investigators Thursday said faulty electrical wiring may have
set off the blaze.
	   ``We have stopped looking for casualties. I believe we have
already gone through what was left of the orphanage several times
and we have not found any more human remains,'' Cordeta said.
	   The orphanage also took care of children of unwed mothers and
children of working parents.
	   Evelyn Lontok, a social worker with the Department of Social
Welfare and Development, said staffers told authorities there were
49 children and 19 adults inside the orphanage at the time of the
blaze.
	   Some of the children shouted for help from the second-floor
windows, which were covered with metal grills to protect against
intruders, but neighbors were unable to open the padlocked main
gate to get to them.
	   The children had been looking forward to a Christmas party
Friday.
	   Pope John Paul II said he was deeply saddened and promised to
pray for the victims, according to Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the
Vatican secretary of state.
	   Jaime Cardinal Sin, the archbishop of Manila, called for
prayers.
	   Relatives of those who died said Friday they are considering a
mass burial for those who have not been identified because of
severe burns.
	   Juan Agravante, a real estate salesman, was also killed in the
fire. He had been visiting his wife, Maria Theresa, a baby-sitter
at the orphanage.
	   Their bodies were found in each other's arms, hugging their two
sons, John Andrian, 8, and Jomari, 2.
	   Ederlina Mobreros, whose 5-year-old daughter Maybeline died in
the fire, was bitter.
	   She said she was told her daughter had been abandoned along with
two other children who could not be roused from their sleep by one
of the staff who saved nine others.
	   ``Why was my daughter abandoned? They could have tossed her out
through the fire exit. She could have been hurt but she would still
be alive,'' she said, tears welling in her eyes.
	   Paco fire chief Romeo Almero was dismissed Friday by acting
Manila fire chief Roel Chua. No reason was given, but Philippine
news reports said firemen had arrived late at the scene.
	   Fire officials earlier said they received the first call about
the blaze at around 2 a.m., more than an hour after witnesses saw
the first signs of fire.
	   They said about 70 percent of the orphanage was already burning
when they arrived a few minutes later.
	   There were no telephones in the immediate vicinity and orphanage
staffers said the room where its telephone was located had been
engulfed in flames.
	   Faulty equipment or lax enforcement of fire regulations are
responsible for many deadly fires in the Philippines.
	   In May 1998, a fire at the Lung Center of the Philippines in
suburban Quezon City killed 25 people and devastated the
government-run hospital. Two years earlier, a fire at the Ozone
Disco in the same suburb killed 162 people.

Czech Activists protest pig farm on former Roma concentration camp
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ More than 100 prominent activists
are pressuring the government to demolish a pig farm that stands on
the site of a World War II concentration camp for Gypsies, the
Lidovne Noviny newspaper reported Friday.
	   ``We regard the ... pig farm at the site as a desecration of a
monument to the victims as well as an insult to humanity,''
protester Pavel Theiner told the CTK news agency.
	   Prague Rabbi Karold Sidon, renowned Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal
and more than 100 others sent a letter last week to the government
to demand removal of the pig farm built by the former communist
regime and privatized in 1994.
	   ``The government has 30 days,'' said Cenek Ruzicka, a descendant
of one of the victims of the concentration camp which held solely
Gypsies, or Roma, in the southern Czech Republic. ``If they do
nothing we will put strong pressure on them.'' He did not
elaborate.
	   More than 300 Roma died in 1942 and 1943 in the camp near the
town of Pisek, 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of Prague. Other
Roma were sent to Auschwitz. Overall, hundreds of thousands died in
the Holocaust.
	   Government spokesman Libor Roucek said the Cabinet was aware of
the activists' concerns and will examine the issue.
	   ``The government realizes how sensitive the issue is but we have
	   to consider the (pig farm) owners' rights as well,'' Roucek
said, ``eventually some sort of removal will probably take place.''
	   A caretaker administration that governed the country for six
months before 1998 elections decided to remove the farm, but had no
time to enact the promise.

German foreign minister meets Chinese dissident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's foreign minister has met a
prominent Chinese democracy campaigner to discuss human rights in
China, officials said Friday.
	   Wei Jingsheng's talk with Joschka Fischer in Bonn on Thursday
reflected what the 6-week-old center-left government says is a new
emphasis on human rights in German foreign policy.
	   ``Of course we see the topic's sensitivity, but there can be no
ban on talks,'' government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said.
	   Chinese-German ties have been strained by last month's expulsion
of a German magazine reporter from China for allegedly stealing
state secrets.
	   The reporter, Juergen Kremb, speculated that Chinese officials
wanted to punish him for occasionally critical reporting and for
contacts with dissidents, including Wei, about whom Kremb published
a book last year.
	   China gave Wei medical parole from jail last year. He went into
exile in the United States.
	   ``Fischer was interested in Wei's view and asked him for his
assessment of the current situation in China,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Martin Erdmann said. He refused to give details of the
talks.
	   Wei was in Germany to attend a ceremony marking the 50th
anniversary of the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

China carries out dope-test blitz ahead of Asian Games

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Eager to avoid any doping scandals,
China carried out more than 500 drug tests in the month before the
Asian Games, and at least one came up positive, Chinese officials
said Friday.
	   Wu Shouzhang, China's assistant head of mission, refused to give
any details about the athlete who tested positive in a check last
month. He said a second test had to be conducted first. If
confirmed, the athlete would be the ninth China has caught for
doping this year, Wu said.
	   China has stepped up efforts to avoid a repeat of the doping
scandals that dogged its team at the last Asian Games in Hiroshima,
Japan, in 1994, when 11 athletes, including seven swimmers, failed
drug tests. China was the runaway champion of the games, bagging
137 _ or 41 percent _ of the 337 gold medals.
	   The more than 500 tests conducted in the month before these
games in Bangkok, Thailand, took China's total close to 3,000 for
the year and covered around 20 events, said Shi Kangcheng, deputy
secretary of China's more than 800-member delegation to the games.
	   ``The tests touched on the majority of events at the Asian
Games,'' he said. China is competing in all but four of the 36
events.
	   China's drug problems at Hiroshima and at this year's swimming
world championships at Perth, Australia, where four swimmers failed
drugs tests, fueled suspicions that China's sporting successes have
been due to widespread drug use. In 1997, 24 Chinese athletes were
caught for doping offenses.
	   China denies running a systematic doping program and says it has
strengthened efforts to weed out and punish drug cheats. Chinese
officials also regularly point out that other countries, including
the United States, have had drug problems too.
	   ``Because of what happened at Hiroshima, we really have taken
added measures,'' said Li Furong, deputy head of the Chinese
delegation. ``There is pressure. Of course we hope to have a clean
games.''
	   In the six months before the games, Chinese athletes and coaches
were given repeated lectures warning against use of drugs, he said.
But he also said no country could give a 100 percent guarantee that
none of its athletes would test positive.
	   ``If there is a doping incident and they haven't taken our
lessons to heart, then we won't be forgiving. We'll punish them
severely,'' he said.

Arafat expected to make strong policy statement in Stockholm

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is
expected to present a major policy statement on working out a final
peace agreement with Israel during a visit to the Swedish capital
on Saturday, the visit's arranger said.
	   The official reason for Arafat's trip is to attend a meeting
commemorating the 10th anniversary of Arafat's statement in
Stockholm recognizing Israel's right to exist.
	   But officials said Friday that unofficial talks between Israeli
and Palestinian representatives have been taking place in Stockholm
since 1994 and Arafat's speech is expected to build on those talks.
	   ''Arafat will, in his talk ... put forward principles for final
negotiations and they can be expected to get wide support,'' Sten
Andersson, chairman of the Olof Palme Center that arranged the
meeting, was quoted as saying by the Swedish news agency TT.
	   Israel will be represented at the meeting by Meir Sheetrit,
group leader for the governing parties in the Israeli parliament,
the Knesset, and Yossi Beilin, a top member of the main opposition
Labor Party.
	   Although that representation is not on Arafat's level in terms
of protocol, Beilin is an influential figure as one of the
architects of the Oslo Accord treaty between Israel and the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
	   Beilin had been involved in the Stockholm unofficial talks,
Israeli Embassy spokesman Shlomo Morgan said. The talks reportedly
also included influential Palestinian academics.
	   ''The talks have taken place with a certain regularity,''
Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh said Friday ``They hang
together _ the Oslo process and these talks,''
	   Andersson, who was foreign minister during Arafat's visit in
1988, declined to give details of what the Palestinian leader might
say, saying ''This is Arafat's matter.''
	   Among the most critical issues in the collapsing peace process
is whether Arafat will declare a separate Palestinian state. He
claims the Oslo Accord allows him to do so as of early May 1999,
but the document's wording on the matter is vague.
	   Israel this week suspended its troop withdrawals from the West
Bank until the Palestinians meet a series of demands including
publicly abandoning intentions to declare a state in May.
	   The suspension came after the beating of an Israeli soldier by a
Palestinian mob. Israel contends the attack was the result of
incitement by the Palestinian Authority.
	   The process also is stalled over a disagreement about the
release by Israel of Palestinian prisoners.
	   In the Wye agreement signed in October, Israel promised to
withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank and release
750 Palestinian prisoners by January. In a first stage last month,
it withdrew from 2 percent of the area and set free 250 prisoners,
but most were criminals, not security prisoners, as the Palestinian
Authority had expected.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin, who remains hospitalized with
pneumonia, met Friday with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who
advised the president to make a full recovery before returning to
the Kremlin.
	   Primakov told the president, who is known to be a restless
patient, not to rush his return to work, said presidential
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin.
	   Yeltsin was admitted to the hospital on Nov. 22 _ almost two
weeks ago _ and Yakushkin declined to say when he might be
released.
	   Other aides said this week that the president may return to work
at the Kremlin on Monday, but Yakushkin refused to confirm that.
	   ``The president is eager to come back to work at the Kremlin as
early as tomorrow, but doctors don't recommend that,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin has been handling paper work and talking to officials
this week. ``Boris Nikolayevich is in a very energetic mood,''
Yakushkin said.
	   Meanwhile, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, one of Russia's most
prominent politicians and a likely presidential candidate, said the
president's frequent ailments have weakened the government.
	   ``The president is ill indeed and he can work effectively only
for a small part of his working time,'' Luzhkov said in an
interview with Germany's ARD television on Thursday night. ``All of
us feel the absence of the president.''
	   However, ``even the fact that the president is in place is a
certain stabilizing factor for the society,'' Luzhkov said in
remarks that were also carried by the Interfax news agency. ``There
is no reason to see the president's health problem as equal to the
danger of the country's collapse.''
	   Yeltsin's bout of pneumonia is his second in as many years and
the latest in a string of illnesses that have eroded his authority
and raised doubts about his ability to serve out a term that ends
in 2000.
	   Ruslan Orekhov, head of the presidential legal department,
dismissed speculation that Yeltsin's was growing weaker and that
the president employs a machine, rather than his own hand, to sign
official documents.
	   ``The facsimile (machine) is never used on presidential
orders,'' Orekhov told the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda, adding that
it's only used on occasion to sign routine documents.
	   Orekhov also denied allegations that documents presented to
Yeltsin are typed in extra large letters to make them easier to
read.
	   At several public ceremonies, Yeltsin has signed documents in an
extremely slow and laborious manner, but Orekhov said this was
merely a personal habit, not a sign of his weakness.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A ruling party chief has given a legislator
charged with fraud a leave of absence from Parliament, Singapore TV
reported Friday.
	   Choo Wei Khiang, 44, a People's Action Party legislator since
1988, was charged this week with cheating by issuing false invoices
to swindle a finance company out of 1.83 million Singapore dollars
(dlrs 1.11 million).
	   The ruling party's chief, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, granted
Choo a leave of absence from party and constituency duties, upon
his request, the report said.
	   The last time a ruling party legislator faced criminal charges
is thought to have been in the 1970s, according to local
historians.
	   Choo's behavior since becoming a legislator has attracted
unwanted attention on previous occasions.
	   In 1992, he was forced to apologize for a racial slur against
Indians in Singapore and was temporarily suspended from his
prestigious country club for dangerous golf play.

Germany expects new funds for Holocaust victims by mid-month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's government
expects to work out details by mid-December for industry-wide
restitution funds for former Nazi slave laborers and other
uncompensated Holocaust victims, a spokesman said Friday.
	   Reversing long-standing German policy, Schroeder pledged to
establish joint government-industry funds in October.
	   Government officials and industry leaders have been meeting
regularly to work out details of how much will be paid, how
compensation will be distributed and whether the government will
contribute money.
	   Under pressure from lawsuits seeking compensation for Holocaust
survivors, top German industrial firms, banks and insurance
companies appealed to the new-center left government to establish
funds to help them deal with claims.
	   Among those participating in the group are the bosses of Allianz
insurance company, Dresdner and Deutsche banks, Volkswagen, BMW,
Siemens, Krupp, Degussa and BASF.
	   The German government has paid billions in compensation to
Holocaust victims for health damage and imprisonment. But it had
rejected claims for back wages from slave laborers, saying the
companies involved were responsible.
	   Most German firms, though, argued the workers were forced on
them by the Nazis and so the current government, as legal successor
to the Nazi regime, should be responsible.

Why don't the stars come out for Davis Cup?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Anders Jarryd says he can't understand why
some top players refuse to play in the Davis Cup.
	   ``You want to grab as many titles as you can because you never
know what's going to happen, when there will be another chance,''
said the retired doubles specialist, an assistant coach for
Sweden's Davis Cup team at this weekend's final.
	   ``It's sad the U.S. team doesn't have its best players all the
time. It's a shame,'' Jarryd said.
	   Fielding a second-string squad, the United States lost to Italy,
Sweden's Davis Cup final opponent, in September's semifinals.
	   No. 1 Pete Sampras led the United States to the 1995 title with
a memorable performance against Russia in the final, but skipped
the team event in 1996 and 1998.
	   Andre Agassi, sixth in the ATP rankings, didn't show for the
semifinal against Italy citing a prior commitment _ and then
blasted the head of the U.S. Tennis Association.
	   Jarryd does see something positive in the lack of stars _
there's no one in the top 30 _ at the final.
	   ``It means in a way that tennis is a global sport. Individual
rankings don't mean as much when it's a team sport, so that's
good,'' he said.
	   ``Of course, in another way, when you don't have the top
players,'' he added, ``it's difficult for the general public to
understand why.''
	   Jarryd, ninth on the all-time ATP list with 58 career doubles
titles, said the lack of marquee names doesn't cheapen the
year-long competition.
	   ``I think if you look at the long run, it doesn't mean
anything,'' he said. ``The Davis Cup is much bigger than one or two
players.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MILAN ON MAP: &LR;  It's been nearly three years since serious tennis
graced Italy's financial capital.
	   The Assago Forum, on the outskirts of Milan, used to host the
ATP's Italian Indoors, but that event was dropped from the schedule
because of poor attendance.
	   At the last edition in early 1996, big-serving Croatian Goran
Ivanisevic swept both the singles and doubles titles.
	   His doubles partner? Andrea Gaudenzi, Italy's leading Davis Cup
player.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARTING SHOTS: &LR;  Italy and Sweden have met 18 times in the Davis
Cup, with the Italians holding an 11-7 edge, including 7-2 at home.
This is the countries' first meeting in a final. ... Since the
World Group format was established in 1981, only three countries
have stayed in the top flight the entire time. Italy and Sweden are
two, Czech Republic is the other. ... The United States has
captured the most Davis Cup titles with 31, the last in 1995.
Australia is next with 26. Sweden ranks fifth all-time with its six
titles, Italy has one.

Ho Chi Minh City authorities to put tighter control on Internet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A special committee will be set up in Ho
Chi Minh City to inspect the use of Internet services and possibly
place restrictions on them, the Liberated Saigon newspaper reported
Friday.
	   The committee will direct the use of Internet services in line
with the government's guidelines, the paper said.
	   The city Communist Party organization and the municipal People's
Committee decided at a recent meeting to revamp the use of Internet
services, including ``correcting mistakes and bias,'' the paper
said without elaborating.
	   They also assigned the police and the Culture Department to
outline plans to stop `` negative'' information on the Internet,
the paper said.
	   A year ago, the central government decided to allow the use of
Internet services after thorough consideration that negative
information could flow into the country.
	   Some 15,000 people are using the Internet in Ho Chi Minh City
from the five service providers in the city.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ A Palestinian university student who
participated in an attack on an Israeli soldier and seized his M-16
assault rifle has been arrested, a senior Palestinian official said
Friday.
	   The rifle was handed over to the governor of the West Bank town
of Ramallah, Mustafa Issa, on Wednesday night, several hours after
about a dozen Palestinians pelted an Israeli car with stones,
pulled the soldier out of the vehicle and struck him repeatedly in
the head with rocks.
	   The soldier escaped with head injuries. The incident, captured
by TV cameras, triggered an outrage in Israel and led to Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to suspend the upcoming West
Bank troop withdrawal.
	   The Palestinian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the M-16 was handed over by Palestinian university students
not involved in the attack on the soldier.
	   One of the students was held for questioning, however, and later
the student who had seized the M-16 was arrested.
	   A preliminary Israeli army investigation into the incident has
found that the soldier under attack, Cpl. Assaf Meyara, 19, should
have fired on his assailants, the Yediot Ahronot daily said.
	   Meyara will likely be charged in military court with violating
army procedures, the newspaper said.
	   The army spokesman's office had no immediate comment.
	   Israel and the Palestinians have blamed each other for the
violence, which came days before U.S. President Bill Clinton was to
arrive in the region to usher in the second stage of the Wye River
land-for-security agreement.

Naples puts up one-way signs for pedestrians in Christmas season
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAPLES, Italy (AP) _ Naples' narrow alleyways have gotten so
crowded with tourists and shoppers at Christmas that the city has
decided to post one-way signs for pedestrians.
	   ``The streets are filled with small shops, stands and creches,''
Marco Bologna, chief spokesman for the city, said Friday.
	   The one-way signs will be put up Dec. 13 and stay there until
Jan. 6, the Italian feast of Epiphany, which marks the end of the
holiday season.
	   The famed Via San Gregorio Armeno, which is lined with nativity
scenes and attracts tourists from worldwide, is among the roughly
one dozen streets that will be posted.
	   ``We're obviously not giving people fines if they don't follow
the directions,'' Bologna said. ``We just want to suggest a route
to make it easier for people to get around.''
	   The historic alleys, which are already closed to traffic, are no
wider than five meters (yards. Tens of thousands of people stroll
the streets during the Christmas season.

Government uses emergency decree to end customs strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with premier signing mobilization
order, details. No pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Premier Costas Simitis resorted to a rare
civic emergency decree Friday to force customs workers to end a
strike that has dried up fuel supplies and left many Greeks without
heating oil.
	   Simitis signed an order for a ``civil mobilization,'' which
allows the government to draft Greeks into service during times of
national crisis. Such orders are usually issued in times of war.
	   The decree shows the determination of Simitis' government not to
give in to labor protests against belt-tightening measures designed
to earn Greece a spot in the European Union's single currency group
by 2001.
	   Strikers ignoring the order face immediate arrest. There was no
immediate response from union leaders, who have already ignored two
court decisions declaring the strike illegal.
	   The walkout, which began Monday, has left more than 2 million
vehicles without fuel and hundreds of trucks stranded at the
border. It even forced the closure Friday of the main landfill
serving greater Athens. Temperatures have fallen to near freezing
in some mountainous parts of northern Greece.
	   The customs workers called the strike to oppose plans to unify
Greece's nearly 200 state pension funds.
	   Even if customs officers return to work Friday, it will take at
least two days to fully replenish the market. The government
estimated the strike cost Greece 8 billion drachmas (dlrs 28.3
million) a day.
	   Most of Greece's gasoline and heating oil arrives in Greece via
non-EU nations. Goods shipped from EU partners are not affected by
the strike.
	   The customs protest added to the misery caused by a broad array
of strikes against government austerity plans.
	   In Athens, the fuel crunch had one positive result: easing the
city's chronic traffic jams.

France, Britain agree that Europe needs independent defense
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Blair, Chirac quotes from news
conference; trims, ADDS details. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By THIBAULT LEROUX &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-MALO, France (AP) _ France and Britain on Friday agreed
that Europe needs a stronger, more independent defense policy to
help it react more effectively to international crises.
	   In a joint statement, French and British leaders said the
European Union should have the ability to act independently, using
``credible military'' forces.
	   But they added that European military forces would act in
conformity with existing alliances, in particular with NATO.
	   ``It is vital for Europe to have a stronger and more coherent
force and voice in international affairs,'' British Prime Minister
Tony Blair told a news conference after meeting with President
Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin in this Brittany
port town.
	   Chirac called the joint declaration ``an affirmation of the
European Union on the international scene.''
	   ``We wanted to take a major step forward,'' Chirac said,
emphasizing that Europeans want to put in place ``a real foreign
defense policy.''
	   Earlier Friday, Defense Ministers Alain Richard of France and
George Robertson of Britain, meeting aboard two frigates, signed an
agreement that would allow for greater cooperation in crisis
management and military operations.
	   Britain and France, both nuclear powers and U.N. Security
Council members, traditionally have been at odds over the role of
the European Union.
	   But both now recognize the need for Europe to cope militarily
when the United States does not get involved in crises.
	   The EU is sensitive to criticism that it reacts too slowly and
in disjointed fashion to crises such as Kosovo, forcing the United
States to take the lead.
	   France has been pushing for an independent European defense,
starting with a European pillar within NATO. But Britain has said
NATO must remain the cornerstone of defense and security.
	   Paris and London have stressed there are no plans yet to abolish
the Western European Union, the EU's fledgling defense arm, or to
merge it into the European Union.
	   French officials say the summit, unprecedented in terms of the
number of officials attending, was the result of a change in
British policy toward the EU since Blair's Labor Party took over
from the Conservative Party in May 1997.
	   Topics on the agenda also included EU tax levels, small
business, and cooperation in Africa, where both countries have
former colonies.
	   The two countries also agreed to propose to fellow EU leaders a
reprieve for duty-free shopping within the European Union, which is
due to be abolished next year.

Kosovo Albanians appeal for more help amid escalating violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Kosovo Albanians' political
leader pleaded anew for international military intervention Friday
after the worst breach of an informal cease-fire in the troubled
province.
	   Ibrahim Rugova's appeal came with Kosovo's de-facto truce under
dangerous new strain following the killings of 12 ethnic Albanians
in the previous two days, including eight shot by Yugoslav border
guards.
	   The escalating violence lends added urgency to American-led
diplomatic efforts to reach a political settlement on Kosovo's
status. A day after U.S. envoy Christopher Hill appealed to Serb
officials to accept a revised peace plan, U.S. State Department
officials presented the changes to ethnic Albanian officials Friday
in Kosovo's capital, Pristina.
	   Rugova had no immediate reaction to the revised plan, the
specifics of which were not released. But the Albanian leader
renewed his call for more international assistance in ending
hostilities in Kosovo, where dozens have died in sporadic clashes
since an Oct. 12 U.S.-brokered peace agreement.
	   ``NATO ground troop deployment would provide a greater sense of
security,'' he said at a news conference.
	   The 12 shooting deaths of ethnic Albanians since Wednesday is
``a sign that we need a special security force which will protect
citizens and stop violence in Kosovo,'' Rugova said.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and up to 300,000 were left
homeless after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a
crackdown last February against rebels who demand independence for
Kosovo, which is populated overwhelmingly by ethnic Albanians.
	   Bloodshed abated _ but did not end _ after Milosevic agreed on a
cease-fire and promised U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke Oct. 12 to end
the Kosovo campaign and begin political negotiations.
	   The agreement, which staved off threatened NATO airstrikes,
allowed for 2,000 unarmed international monitors to patrol Kosovo,
with NATO flying verification missions overhead.
	   A commander of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, meanwhile,
disputed the Yugoslav army's report that eight ethnic Albanians
shot dead Thursday near the Albanian border were guerrillas.
	   The commander, who gave his name as Sylemetaj, said in Velika
Krusa that the victims were refugees returning to that village in
southwestern Kosovo. Six were students and most were from a single
family clan, the Hotis, he said.
	   Western officials who visited the shooting site said it appeared
the Albanians had stumbled on the army unexpectedly, raising
questions about the army account that the victims were armed rebels
who had fired on them first.
	   The border shootings took place one day after three ethnic
Albanians were gunned down in their car in Pristina, killings the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army blamed on Serbia's secret police.
Another ethnic Albanian was shot dead Wednesday while traveling on
a main Kosovo road.
	   Retaliation by the KLA to those shootings would represent a
grave threat to the already-fragile de-facto truce.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is assembling the force of 2,000 verifiers, said the shooting
incidents appeared unrelated and were unlikely to ``represent a
dramatic change in the security situation in the short term.''
	   Hill is spearheading international efforts to get the Serbs and
Albanians to reach agreement on Kosovo's future status before the
tense Serbian province explodes in new fighting.
	   Ethnic Albanians still insist on independence for Kosovo, while
Serbs reject any plan that would not keep it within Kosovo.
	   A proposal to give Kosovo some form of self-rule for an interim
period until a permanent solution can be found has gained backing
among both Rugova's moderate political bloc and the KLA in recent
days.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian police swinging batons
scuffled Friday with about 100 pro-democracy protesters, who fought
back with punches and kicks.
	   No one was injured and no arrests were reported in the clashes
in central Jakarta.
	   The students pushed their way through one line of security
personnel to march toward the presidential palace but were stopped
by another about one kilometer (one half mile) from the palace.
	   Another 300 student protesters also defied warnings from the
Southeast Asian nation's powerful military and staged a noisy but
peaceful street rally not far from the presidential palace.
	   Friday's demonstrations in the capital are the latest in a
series of almost daily protests against President B.J. Habibie, who
announced Thursday that parliamentary elections will be held on
June 7.
	   Indonesia's highest legislative body, the People's Consultative
Assembly, is to convene in August to select a new head of state.
	   Students have led growing demands for political change since
former authoritarian President Suharto stepped down after riots and
protests in May.
	   At the same time, widespread unemployment due to the country's
worst economic crisis in decades has set off religious and other
social tensions.
	   On Nov. 13 soldiers shot nine students to death and injured
dozens more when protesters tried to march on Parliament.
	   On Friday, squads of troops and armored personnel carriers
blocked students, who marched to a busy intersection only a few
hundred meters (yards) from the palace complex.
	   They chanted anti-government slogans and called on the
government to speed up promised democratic reforms.
	   The students also demanded that Suharto face trial on corruption
charges. Some handed flowers to the soldiers.

Bank of France governor says worst of economic crisis is over
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Bank of France governor Jean-Claude Trichet said in
an interview published Friday there are ``several reassuring
signs'' that the worst of the global economic crisis is over.
	   Trichet told the French daily Le Monde that economic adjustment
underway in southeast Asia and the plan by Japan to restructure its
banking sector are encouraging signs.
	   ``However, there is clearly no room for the least complacency,''
Trichet was quoted as saying.
	   Trichet also said that in Europe he sees no sign of a credit
crunch in the financial system. Thursday's move by euro-zone
central banks to reduce interest rates instead was rooted in
worries about growth in a climate where inflation is subdued.
	   Trichet singled out an anomaly of the French banking sector,
where above-market interest rates paid on some savings products
sold by state-sector financial institutions remain ``a handicap.''
	   He said that ``the French banking-sector environment, regulatory
and legislative, could be improved to put our institutions on more
equal and competitive footing.''

North Korea holds large anti-U.S. rally
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ More than 100,000 North Korean
soldiers, workers and students rallied Friday vowing an ``all-out''
war against the United States, an official North Korean report
said.
	   The North Korean society is tightly controlled by its Stalinist
regime, and Friday's outburst of animosity was believed to have
been staged by the government, South Korean officials said.
	   In the past three days, North Korea's news media have brimmed
with statements claiming the country was ``on full alert for war''
in case a dispute with Washington over nuclear inspections in the
North comes to blows.
	   Those at the rally at Kim Il Sung Square at the heart of
Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, vowed to answer ``the reckless
provocation of the U.S. imperialist aggressors with an all-out
war,'' the official Korean Central News Agency said.
	   The KCNA said senior party and government officials joined the
rally, where people from various walks of life spoke, all
condemning what they called a U.S. plot to stifle the communist
state with military force, it said.
	   ``Eight million youth and schoolchildren of Korea will become
human bombs and make suicidal attack to blow up the sources of war
including the U.S. territory,'' KCNA quoted a student as saying.
	   North Korea usually sends out belligerent rhetoric, especially
when it enters high-stake talks with Washington.
	   The United States and North Korea are set to resume talks Friday
about inspections of an underground North Korean site suspected of
being used to produce nuclear weapons.
	   Washington demands unconditional inspections of the North's
underground project. But North Korea asked Washington to pay dlrs
300 million for the right to inspect the site.
	   The United States says the North's reluctance to allow outside
inspectors violates a 1994 framework agreement with Washington to
freeze its nuclear program in return for two modern nuclear
reactors worth dlrs 4.6 billion.

Italian media magnate says pay-TV should be an Italian venture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian companies should block Rupert Murdoch from
acquiring a majority stake in their pay-TV venture, Italy's leading
film producer urged in an interview published Friday.
	   ``A foreign partner is fine. But giving him the majority would
be mad,'' Vittorio Cecchi Gori was quoted as saying in La Stampa
daily.
	   Murdoch, the Australian-born chairman and chief executive of
News Corp., said last week he was close to signing a deal with
Telecom Italia that would create a company to compete with Telepiu,
the pay-TV unit that is 90 percent controlled by Canal Plus SA.
	   Cecchi Gori, whose works include the Cannes-honored ``La Vita e
Bella'' (Life is Beautiful), is expected to be part of the venture,
through his Media Holding.
	   Telecom has said it will likely reach an agreement for a digital
television platform by Christmas.
	   However, the company's new chief executive, Franco Bernabe,
threw out a nearly completed deal with News Corp this week, saying
it involved too much financial risk.
	   News Corp. is a multinational media concern based in Australia.
Its U.S. holdings include the Fox TV networks and the Fox film
studios.

Antiaircraft missile accidentally fired

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ An antiaircraft missile was
accidentally fired into busy commercial airspace over the western
city of Inchon on Friday, injuring three people, officials said.
	   Those injured suffered minor cuts on their heads and hands from
tiny metal fragments from the missile that exploded in the air,
police said.
	   About 20 cars were also damaged by the fragments, police said.
The explosion started brush fires in nearby hills but they were
quickly put out.
	   The Defense Ministry said the Nike-Hercules missile was fired
accidentally by an electronic circuit malfunction during a routine
training session.
	   The ministry apologized for the accident and ordered a thorough
checkup of the 33-year-old, U.S.-built missile system.
	   The missile was automatically destroyed by a built-in safety
device seconds after it left the launcher, sending a shower of
hundreds of metal fragments over a nearby residential area, they
said.
	   One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
missile was believed to have been destroyed before it reached a
height of 500 meters (1,650 feet).
	   Virtually all of the some 250 passenger and cargo planes that
use Seoul's Kimpo International Airport daily pass through the
airspace over Inchon, according to aviation authorities.
	   ``When the planes fly over Inchon, they are at least 4,000 feet
(1,200 meters) above ground and at least five to 10 miles (8
kilometers to 16 kilometers) apart. I would not speculate what
could have happened if the missile had not been destroyed so
quickly,'' said
	   Kim Dong-jin, an official at the Seoul District Air Traffic
Control Center.
	   Kim said his office could not say how many commercial airplanes
were flying over Inchon at the time of the missile launch and were
in possible danger until it received more data from the military.
	   But the national Yonhap news agency reported that at least four
commercial planes, including a Singapore Air passenger jet, were
over Inchon around the time the missile was accidentally fired.
	   Inchon is about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the heavily
guarded border with communist North Korea.
	   The two Koreas are technically at war, with no peace treaty
signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ A Palestinian university student who
participated in an attack on an Israeli soldier and seized his M-16
assault rifle has been arrested, a senior Palestinian official said
Friday.
	   The rifle was handed over to the governor of the West Bank town
of Ramallah hours after a dozen Palestinians pelted an Israeli car
with stones Wednesday, pulled the soldier out of the vehicle and
struck him repeatedly in the head with rocks.
	   The soldier escaped with head injuries. The incident, captured
by TV cameras, triggered an outrage in Israel and led to Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to suspend the upcoming West
Bank troop withdrawal.
	   The Palestinian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the M-16 was handed over by Palestinian university students
not involved in the attack on the soldier.
	   One of the students was held for questioning, however, and later
the student who had seized the M-16 was arrested. The official
wouldn't identify the student.
	   A preliminary Israeli army investigation into the incident has
found that the soldier under attack, Cpl. Assaf Meyara, 19, should
have fired on his assailants, the Yediot Ahronot daily said.
	   Meyara will likely be charged in military court with violating
army procedures, the newspaper said.
	   The army spokesman's office had no immediate comment.
	   Israel and the Palestinians have blamed each other for the
violence, which came days before U.S. President Bill Clinton was to
arrive in the region to usher in the second stage of the Wye River
land-for-security agreement.

Protesters force the access to government headquarter square

<TEXT>
	   CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) _ Some 10,000 angry workers and students
marched Friday to the government headquarters in this former Soviet
republic to protest against falling living standards and months
without pay.
	   Workers broke into the square by force after police tried to
block them saying the gathering was unauthorized. A policeman
fainted in the struggle. Police officers haven't received their
salaries since June. There were no reports of any other incidents.
	   The General Federation of Unions organized the protest. Union
head Ion Godonoga said the state owes some one billion lei (dlrs
100 million) in salaries, grants and pensions to Moldova's 4.4
million population.
	   Several similar protests took place in other cities around the
country. Communism ended in 1991 after Moldova declared
independence following the breakup of the Soviet Union.
	   Government officials refused to talk to the trade unionists
Friday. In a negotiation last week, officials offered to pay state
employees salary arrears in food and free public services, but
unions refused the offer.
	   Moldova's lagging economy follows Russia, its main trading
partner, in a downturn. Moldova's average monthly salary is 330 lei
(dlrs 33).

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, both angry after Protestant
politicians retreated from an apparent deal, on Friday discussed
the mounting sense of crisis besetting Northern Ireland's peace
agreement.
	   David Trimble, meanwhile, jetted off to Washington the day after
his Ulster Unionist Party, main representative of the north's
British Protestant majority, said its divided members might take
weeks to support the next steps forward in making April's accord a
reality.
	   In dispute is the number of departments to be created in
Northern Ireland's new multi-party administration, and what kind of
joint policy-making committees that new government should form with
Ahern's government in the Irish Republic.
	   The British and Irish governments had expected both planks of
the accord to have been formed by October. And the north's Catholic
politicians thought they had reached agreement with the Ulster
Unionists on both points early Thursday _ to create 10
administration posts and seven cross-border committees _ when
British Prime Minister Tony Blair made a special trip to Belfast.
	   Instead, the Ulster Unionists announced no final deal had been
reached, and probably wouldn't be until after Trimble returns from
Oslo, Norway, where on Thursday he and Catholic politician John
Hume will share this year's Nobel Peace Prize.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ An overnight explosion
damaged a U.N. vehicle but caused no injuries, officials reported
Friday.
	   The vehicle was parked in front of U.N. police station in
Vlasenica, a Bosnian Serb town some 70 kilometers (45 miles)
northeast of Sarajevo.
	   The United Nations Mission in Bosnia is ``deeply concerned about
this violent incident'' and expects local authorities ``to ...
bring the culprits to justice,'' said a U.N. statement.
	   Thursday's explosion came a day after NATO-led peace forces in
Bosnia detained a Bosnian Serb three-star general sought by the
U.N. war crimes tribunal on suspicion of war crimes. The arrest of
Gen. Radislav Krstic raised anti-Western feelings in the Serb half
of Bosnia.

Turkish pop star detained over alleged sex-tape scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A new mafia scandal erupted in Turkey on
Friday with news that police were questioning one of the country's
leading celebrities in an attack linked to mobsters.
	   Singer Sibel Can was detained late Thursday on allegations that
she had the mafia kidnap, beat and take nude pictures of a male
model, the Milliyet daily reported.
	   The model allegedly had been blackmailing the singer with a
sexually explicit film in which she figured. It was not clear
whether the reported tape had been filmed with Can's consent.
	   Sabah daily said Can had the pictures of the model taken to put
a stop to his blackmail.
	   Television reports showed a smiling Can arriving at the police
station with her husband. Authorities said she was still being
questioned Friday.
	   Can, a sensuous brunette who began her career in belly dancing
and now sings popular Turkish songs with an Arabic beat, is one of
Turkey's best-paid artists.
	   She denied the allegations, Milliyet said.
	   A mafia scandal brought down Turkey's government last month.
Links between the mafia and the entertainment are said to be common
as well.

Protesters force the access to government headquarter square
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) _ About 10,000 workers and students
marched Friday to the government headquarters in this former Soviet
republic to protest falling living standards and months without
pay.
	   Workers broke into the square by force after police tried to
block them on grounds the gathering was unauthorized. A policeman
fainted in the struggle.
	   There were no reports of other incidents.
	   The General Federation of Unions organized the protest. Union
head Ion Godonoga said the state owes some one billion lei (dlrs
100 million) in salaries, grants and pensions.
	   Government officials, who refused to talk to the trade unionists
Friday, had offered last week to pay state employees salary arrears
in food and free public services, but unions refused the offer.
	   Several similar protests took place in other cities around the
country of 4.4 million Friday.
	   Communism ended in 1991 after Moldova declared independence
following the breakup of the Soviet Union.
	   Moldova's lagging economy follows Russia, its main trading
partner, in a downturn. Moldova's average monthly salary is 330 lei
(dlrs 33).

Indonesia's Suharto tells magazine that he is not above the law
</HEADLINE>

overline and edits to conform. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ In an interview with an Indonesian
magazine, ex-President Suharto called himself ``an ordinary
citizen'' and promised not to challenge an inquiry into his wealth.
	   Suharto denied any wrongdoing and called on student protesters,
who want him tried on corruption charges, to end their almost daily
demonstrations near his heavily guarded Jakarta home.
	   The Dharmais monthly magazine quoted Suharto as saying in an
interview at this house Friday: ``It is better for the students to
go to the parliament to convey their aspirations rather than here,
because I am nothing now. I have resigned.''
	   The interview, which will be published later this month, was
made available by the magazine Friday.
	   Earlier, government officials said they would question Suharto
next week over corruption allegations and could place him under
house arrest.
	   In Friday's interview, Suharto, who quit the presidency last May
after 32 autocratic years, denied allegations by opponents that he
has stashed billions of dollars in foreign bank accounts.
	   He only held 22 million rupiah (dlrs 3 billion) in three
Indonesian bank accounts, Dharmais quoted him as saying.
	   He said this money had been saved from his salary as president
and had been supplemented from rent income from two Jakarta houses
he has leased to foreigners.
	   ``I am aware that as an ordinary citizen, I cannot free myself
from the law,'' Suharto was quoted as saying.
	   The official Antara news agency quoted Attorney General Andi
Mohamad Ghalib as saying Suharto would be summoned for questioning
sometime next week.
	   State Secretary Akbar Tanjung repeated an earlier warning that
officials might place Suharto under house arrest if he does not
cooperate with the investigation.
	   On Thursday, Suharto's successor and onetime protege, President
B.J. Habibie, ordered Ghalib to question Suharto.
	   Opponents claim that Suharto had abused his power and had acted
corruptly to amass a fortune for himself, his family and a clique
of cronies.
	   Ghalib has questioned Suharto before. But an earlier
investigation failed to find any evidence.
	   Critics have accused Ghalib, an army general, of going soft on
Suharto, and had criticized his earlier probe as a whitewash.
	   Forbes magazine this year estimated Suharto's wealth at dlrs 4
billion.

World Bank upset by Ukrainian parliament's suspension of projects
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo KIV101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The World Bank is worried that the
Ukrainian parliament has suspended many of the bank's projects in
this former Soviet republic, a bank official said Friday.
	   Several of the projects have never gotten off the ground because
parliament failed to ratify them, said the bank's director for
Ukraine and Belarus, Paul Siegelbaum.
	   The list of suspended projects expanded this week despite a
visit by a World Bank delegation to Kiev, Siegelbaum said during a
meeting with President Leonid Kuchma, according to the Interfax
news agency.
	   The leftist-dominated legislature on Tuesday failed to ratify a
deal with the World Bank on providing risk guarantees for foreign
creditors, its third unsuccessful attempt to approve the agreement.
	   The vote came the same day a World Bank delegation arrived in
Ukraine to review current projects and discuss new loans for the
next 18 months.
	   Siegelbaum said parliament could jeopardize another dlrs 140
million in energy loans unless Ukraine's Constitutional Court
revokes the legislators' recent ban on raising utility tariffs,
which the World Bank has insisted is necessary for quicker reform
of the energy sector.
	   The loan could be provided by the end of the year if the
country's highest court overturns the ban, Siegelbaum added.
	   Speaking at a meeting with Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko
later Friday, Siegelbaum said the World Bank intends to channel
most of its aid to reforming Ukraine's energy and agriculture
sectors and supporting private businesses.
	   The World Bank suspended cooperation with Ukraine in March
following the International Monetary Fund's decision to freeze aid
to Ukraine because of stalled economic reforms.
	   The IMF finally approved a dlrs 2.2 billion loan in September
after the government took reform steps, and the World Bank resumed
its cooperation as well, granting dlrs 950 million in loans for
several projects.
	   Ukraine had already received more than dlrs 1.5 billion from the
World Bank since it became a member in 1992.

Czech ambassador calls Zilk charges irrelevant
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; UPDATES with Zilk quote, date of Havel meeting

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Charges accusing the former mayor
of Vienna of spying for the Czechoslovak communist police were
withdrawn Friday, CTK news agency reported.
	   Helmut Zilk was rejected for a Czech Republic medal of honor
just three days before the official ceremony on Oct 28, because of
sudden allegations that he was an informant for police in communist
Czechoslovakia.
	   Zilk immediately denied the charges as ``absolute nonsense'' and
demanded further inquiry into the case.
	   Jiri Grusa, Czech ambassador to Vienna called the charges
``irrelevant'' Friday after informing Zilk about the findings of a
special commission set up by the Interior ministry.
	   ``I am glad that what I was saying from the very beginning
turned out to be true,'' Zilk told CTK.
	   According to the report, Zilk is scheduled to arrive in Prague
on Tuesday to meet with Havel and other Czech leaders.
	   Havel withdrew the honor after a source claimed that Zilk spied
for the communist secret service and provided information that led
to several convictions. Zilk also signed a declaration of loyalty
to the Czech communist government, the source claimed.
	   Ivan Medek, head of Havel's office, did not identify the source
then but told the press the information on Zilk was ``absolutely
reliable.''

FIFA allocates places for 2002 World Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ FIFA's executive committee on Friday
allocated the 32 places for the 2002 World Cup finals, leaving
Asian nations to fight for two slots.
	   With France automatically qualified as champion, and Japan and
South Korea as co-hosts, the world governing body was left with one
less qualifying place overall than in this year's tournament.
	   FIFA decided Asia should have four nations in the finals,
including the two already qualified.
	   ``The representatives of Asia were not too happy,'' FIFA
President Sepp Blatter told reporters.
	   But, he added, Asia effectively has more slots than in 1998,
when it qualified three nations, with Iran picking up a fourth slot
in a playoff against Australia, the top qualifier from Oceania.
	   For the next World Cup, the leading contender from Oeania faces
a tough two-leg playoff against a South American team.
	   That decision followed a draw between Europe and South America,
which were the only two regions prepared to take part in the
playoff.
	   Europe retains 14 places in the 2002 World Cup, with an
additional slot for reigning champion France. The French this year
automatically qualified as hosts.
	   Africa and CONCACAF _ covering North and Central America and the
Caribbean _ will keep the five and three places they respectively
held this year.
	   South America has four qualifying places in addition to the slot
it must fight for with Oceania. This year, it had four qualifiers
in addition to reigning champion Brazil.
	   The 2002 World Cup will be the first held in Asia and the first
to be co-hosted.
	   Following his visit this week to South Korea, Blatter restated
his willingness to consider allowing North Korea to host ``one, two
or three'' games of the finals out of South Korea's allocation.
	   But he again insisted that it is up to the countries'
politicians to make the first move.
	   ``We do not mingle with poltical affairs but we're open to any
kind of dialogue,'' Blatter said.
	   FIFA is ``open to the idea'' and the governing executive
committee ``immediately supported this,'' he added.
	   The committee also agreed that the 64-match tournament can be
held within 30 days, between Jun. 1 and Jun. 30, 2002.
	   But ``the decision has to be taken by the organizing
committee,'' Blatter stressed.
	   That schedule would avoid teams having to wait several days
between matches, he said.
	   The FIFA president has said he personally believes the 2002
finals should be completed before the end of June to avoid the July
rainy season in Japan and South Korea.
	   The World Cup finals have traditionally been held in June and
July, avoiding league schedules in Europe and South America.

Government uses emergency decree to end customs strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with customs officers saying they will return to work &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Premier Costas Simitis resorted to a rare
civic emergency decree Friday to force customs workers to end a
strike that has dried up fuel supplies and left many Greeks without
heating oil.
	   Simitis signed an order for a ``civil mobilization,'' which
allows the government to draft Greeks into service during times of
national crisis. Such orders are usually issued in times of war.
	   The decree shows the determination of Simitis' government not to
give in to labor protests against belt-tightening measures designed
to earn Greece a spot in the European Union's single currency group
by 2001.
	   Strikers ignoring the order face immediate arrest. Customs
workers denounced the decision, but said they would return to work.
	   ``We will comply. We can't appeal something like this in court.
It's impossible,'' said union spokesman Ilias Roussakis.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Hundreds of lawyers, many in black
robes, marched to a courthouse Friday in solidarity for an attorney
who faces three months imprisonment for contempt of court in the
trial of politician Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Several dozen pro-Anwar activists joined the lawyers as they
shouted, ``We want justice,'' in front of the federal courthouse.
	   At the courthouse, Zainur Zakaria won a temporary reprieve when
a three-judge bench held off on his imprisonment until his appeal
could be heard. No date was set for the appeal.
	   When Zainur emerged from the courtroom, the lawyers clapped and
cheered.
	   Had Zainur been sent to jail, it would have been the first time
in Malaysia that a lawyer was imprisoned for such a long period for
contempt while defending a client.
	   Previous such sentences have been a day or two in jail.
	   Zainur was sentenced Monday after he refused to apologize for
accusing two prosecutors in Anwar's trial of trying to get a
potential witness to lie.
	   Zainur's attorney, Raja Aziz Addruse, criticized the sentencing
by Judge Augustine Paul as too harsh, calling it ``irregular.''
	   Anwar, who denies wrongdoing, is being tried on four counts of
abuse of power. He will be tried later on another charge of
corruption and five charges of committing illegal sex acts.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar as deputy prime
minister on Sept. 2, saying he had determined his former protege
was too immoral to rule.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, prompting protests, both at home
and abroad.
	   The judge in Anwar's trial has said the allegations Zainur filed
in an affidavit were insulting to the prosecutors.
	   The affidavit had accused senior government prosecutors Abdul
Gani Patail and Azahar Mohamed of trying to cajole a potential
witness into fabricating evidence of sex crimes and had demanded
that the court remove them.
	   Also Friday, about 160 more lawyers joined in the call for a
meeting of the Malaysian Bar Council to discuss Zainur's treatment.
As of Thursday, 74 lawyers had called for the meeting for Zinur, a
former council chairman.

Two people dead in rainstorm in Sardinia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAGLIARI, Sardinia (AP) _ Two days of heavy rain across northern
Sardinia shut down road and rail routes Friday. At least two people
died.
	   A 28-year-old student was killed in a car crash, and a
35-year-old worker slipped off scaffolding and died in a hospital.
Both accidents occurred Thursday near Cagliari.
	   The Olbia-Chilivani railway, on the northeastern part of the
island, was closed Friday by flooding. Officials said it won't
reopen until Sunday.
	   The Nuoro-Ortisei highway was closed to traffic after a car ran
off a road and into a stream below, the ANSA news agency reported.
	   The floods swept away trees, along with 1,500 tons of cork that
had been piled up by factories in the area. Cork represents one of
Sardinia's main resources and authorities said the damage could
amount to dlrs 5.9 million.
	   Bad weather hit up and down the country.
	   Downtown Venice and St. Mark's Square were flooded by high
water, which was 113 centimeters (45 inches) above average sea
level.
	   In Quindici, the southern city hit by massive mudslide last May,
officials were on the alert after hours of heavy rain.
	   Forecasters said there was no end in sight to the bad weather.

FIFA allocates places for 2002 World Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ FIFA's executive committee on Friday
allocated the 32 places for the 2002 World Cup finals, leaving
Asian nations to fight for two slots.
	   With France automatically qualified as champion, and Japan and
South Korea as co-hosts, the world governing body was left with one
less qualifying place overall than in this year's tournament.
	   FIFA decided Asia should have four nations in the finals,
including the two already qualified.
	   ``The representatives of Asia were not too happy,'' FIFA
President Sepp Blatter told reporters.
	   But, he added, Asia effectively has more slots than in 1998,
when it qualified three nations, with Iran picking up a fourth slot
in a playoff against Australia, the top qualifier from Oceania.
	   For the next World Cup, the leading contender from Oceania will
face a tough two-leg playoff against a South American team.
	   That decision followed a draw between Europe and South America,
which were the only two regions prepared to take part in the
playoff.
	   Europe retains 14 places in the 2002 World Cup, with an
additional slot for reigning champion France. The French this year
automatically qualified as hosts.
	   Africa and CONCACAF _ covering North and Central America and the
Caribbean _ will keep the five and three places they respectively
held this year.
	   South America has four qualifying places in addition to the slot
it must fight for with Oceania. This year, it had four qualifiers
in addition to reigning champion Brazil.
	   The 2002 World Cup will be the first held in Asia and the first
to be shared between two hosts.
	   Following his visit this week to South Korea, Blatter restated
his willingness to consider allowing North Korea to host ``one, two
or three'' games of the finals out of South Korea's allocation.
	   But he again insisted that it is up to the countries'
politicians to make the first move.
	   ``We do not mingle with political affairs but we're open to any
kind of dialogue,'' Blatter said.
	   FIFA is ``open to the idea'' and the governing Executive
Committee ``immediately supported this,'' he added.
	   The committee also agreed that the 64-match tournament can be
held within 30 days, between June 1-30, 2002.
	   But ``the decision has to be taken by the organizing
committee,'' Blatter stressed.
	   That schedule would avoid teams having to wait several days
between matches, he said.
	   The FIFA president has said he personally believes the 2002
finals should be completed before the end of June to avoid the July
rainy season in Japan and South Korea.
	   The World Cup finals have traditionally been held in June and
July, avoiding league schedules in Europe and South America.

Venezuelan vote a ``wake-up call'' for Latin America
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BART JONES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Standing before hundreds of thousands
of roaring supporters, many wearing his trademark red parachutist's
beret, ex-coup leader Hugo Chavez laid out the choice for
Venezuelan voters in Sunday's presidential election.
	   ``Here there are two options,'' Chavez, 44, bellowed from a
hydraulic platform high above the crowd at his final campaign rally
Wednesday. ``Corruption and the same old thing, or the salvation of
the country.''
	   Millions of poor people are flocking to the cashiered lieutenant
colonel, whose rise to the top of the polls reflects growing
frustration over the failure of democracy and free markets to
reduce poverty.
	   ``It is a wake-up call for the region,'' said Michael Shifter,
senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington, D.C.
	   The race has polarized Venezuela. The poor see Chavez as a hero
because of his tough anti-corruption talk. The upper classes fear
he will become a leftist dictator.
	   Politicians have ``sacked and robbed this country. When Mr.
Chavez wins, all that will change,'' retired airplane repair worker
Rangel Arcides said at the rally.
	   Chavez's main opponent is Henrique Salas Romer, a Yale-educated
businessman who built a reputation for efficiency as governor of
industrial Carabobo state and is viewed as conservative and
pro-free market.
	   Although he ran as an independent, the country's two main
traditional parties dumped their own candidates last week and
closed ranks behind Salas, 62, in a last-ditch effort to block
Chavez.
	   Salas's administration was ``a model for Venezuela,'' said
teacher Katia de Pannini. ``The only thing Chavez has ever run is
the canteen in the barracks.''
	   Last year, the United States denied Chavez a tourist visa
because of the coup attempt, but Washington says it will respect
Sunday's outcome and hope for the best.
	   ``If Chavez were to win we'll work with him, but his actions
will speak louder than words,'' Peter Romero, assistant secretary
of state for InterAmerican affairs, told The Associated Press.
	   The race is attracting worldwide attention partly because
Venezuela was long one of Latin America's most stable and
prosperous countries.
	   That image shattered in 1989 when then-President Carlos Andres
Perez shocked the nation with free-market austerity, provoking
riots in which security forced killed at least 300 people.
	   In 1992, military rebels twice tried to overthrow Perez, with
Chavez leading the first revolt. Released from prison two years
later, he formed a political movement that invoked independence
hero Simon Bolivar.
	   Most Venezuelans blame the two traditional parties, center-left
Democratic Action and right-center COPEI, for squandering the
world's largest oil reserves outside the Middle East and for a
corrupt political culture widely blamed for sharply declining
living standards.
	   Public hospitals lack supplies as basic as needles, Venezuelans
pay bribes for drivers licenses, telephone hookups, even operations
at crowded hospitals. Well over half the population is mired in
poverty.
	   ``The state almost doesn't exist. There is no law. Democracy has
become illegitimate,'' says Chavez.
	   If Chavez wins, he will be the first president in 40 years of
democracy to come from outside the traditional party elite. His
Patriotic Pole coalition has already broken the old parties'
political stranglehold, winning a plurality in Congress in
elections on Nov. 8.
	   Fears that the military would not accept a Chavez victory have
unnerved Venezuelans. And Chavez says he won't be able to halt
violence if fraud costs him the election.
	   In the past decade, dictatorships have given way to democracy in
Latin America, and state-run economies have generally ceded to free
markets. Yet the gulf between rich and poor has widened.
	   ``Chavez has been pushed by a wave of resentment and frustration
and protest against corruption and against economic policies that
haven't delivered for the great majority,'' said political
scientist Anibal Romero.
	   Chavez says he would pursue a ``third way'' between socialism
and unfettered capitalism. He also vows to convene a constituent
assembly to rewrite the constitution _ and possibly dissolve
Congress.
	   But Chavez insists that he's a democrat ``from head to toe.''
	   A Chavez win could be another example of Latin Americans turning
to caudillos, or strong men. President Alberto Fujimori of Peru
temporarily shut down Congress and the courts six years ago to
clean up corruption, and Bolivia's president, Hugo Banzer, is a
former dictator.
	   Still, few Venezuelans would tolerate a return to dictatorship.
	   ``We need radical changes but within democracy,'' said
unemployed Caracas accountant Fanny de Avendano. She said she was
voting for Salas.

Bruce and McClair are among favorites to replace Kidd as United No.

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Long-serving players Steve Bruce and
Brian McClair left Manchester United within the last two years. Now
they're among the favorites to return to Old Trafford to replace
Brian Kidd as assistant to manager Alex Ferguson.
	   Dismaying Ferguson, the United players and fans, Kidd left
United on Thursday to become manager of last place Blackburn, his
first job as a No. 1.
	   His move comes with United facing up to a match against Aston
Villa Saturday, with the opportunity of replacing Villa at the top
of the standings. Next Wednesday, United faces Bayern Munich with a
quarterfinal place at stake in the Champions Cup.
	   United won't rush into naming a replacement but will have
several candidates in mind, including Bruce and McClair.
	   A long-serving center-back and team captain who helped United
win three Premier League titles in four years and two FA Cups,
37-year-old Bruce is now manager of division one Sheffield United.
He left Old Trafford for a two-year spell as a player with
Birmingham City.
	   At Sheffield, Bruce has fought a running battle with the owners
to gain money to buy players yet has kept the club within range of
promotion to the top flight.
	   McClair, 34, left Old Trafford after 11 years service as a
player. Although he has no managerial experience, he has
qualifications as a coach and has a long-standing relationship with
Ferguson. He left Manchester United in the summer to join one of
his former clubs, Motherwell, as a player.
	   Mark McGhee, 41, who was fired by division one Wolves a month
ago after a series of poor results, is a good friend of Ferguson
and played under him at Aberdeen in the early 1980s.
	   Ferguson may choose to elevate reserve team coach Jimmy Ryan,
although he probably would prefer someone younger than 52.
	   Alex McLeish and Alex Miller, who formed a formidable defensive
partnership under Ferguson at Aberdeen and helped the club win the
Cup Winners Cup in 1983, may be contenders after modest successes
as managers in Scotland. What goes against them is a lack of direct
contact with the English game.
	   Former Manchester United center-back Stewart Houston gained
standout results as assistant and then stand-in manager of Arsenal
after George Graham was fired in 1995.
	   Ferguson said that Ryan would be with him at Villa Park on
Saturday.
	   ``I will take Jim Ryan with me tomorrow,'' he said. ``Jim's a
very experienced man and he knows the club.''

Russian ruble tumbles, inflation to top 70 percent this year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new grafs 7, 9-10 with comments from Primakov,
background. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian ruble tumbled again Friday, trading at
about 20 to the U.S. dollar and threatening to hit its lowest point
since the country's economic crisis struck in August.
	   The ruble's latest slide is an ominous sign for the government,
which desperately wants to stabilize the economy as Russia heads
into the difficult winter months.
	   With President Boris Yeltsin hospitalized, and Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov still struggling to implement a recovery plan, the
economy continues to founder and remains vulnerable to additional
shocks.
	   Primakov said the government would not attempt to fix the ruble
rate, and would continue to let dollars circulate freely in Russia.
He acknowledged that the crisis had left the government with few
good options.
	   ``The government has found it has less room to maneuver in these
conditions than it had a year or two ago,'' Primakov told a session
of the World Economic Forum in Moscow.
	   He blamed previous governments for the country's economic
turmoil and said a lack of stability, as well as the loss of
confidence in the country's future, had jeopardized economic reform
efforts.
	   ``In such conditions, the crisis can become permanent,'' he
said. ``But the worst consequences of the crisis aren't the fall of
the ruble, or the drop in production, but a total crisis of
confidence between creditors and debtors, owners and managers, the
government and the population.''
	   Primakov's government is urgently seeking foreign help, but
International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus came and left
this week without giving any signal that a frozen loan package will
be released soon.
	   The country's financial markets have been largely wiped out by
the economic crisis, which hit Russia in August after first
ravaging many Asian economies last year.
	   In this environment, the value of the ruble is one of the
leading indicators of economic confidence, and it is again on the
decline.
	   After stabilizing temporarily at about 16 to the dollar, it has
been falling in recent days. The official rate was down from 18.8
on Thursday to 19.6 on Friday, and in street trading it took more
than 20 rubles to purchase one U.S. dollar.
	   The ruble dipped below 20 to the dollar shortly after the
country's economic crisis hit in August before making a modest
comeback. The ruble was at about 6 to the dollar before the crisis.
	   Meanwhile, the government announced that inflation has gone up
more than 65 percent so far this year and is expected to top 70
percent by year's end.
	   Russian inflation had been coming down after years of soaring
prices and was expected to be in single digits this year until the
country's economic crisis hit.
	   If the government does not receive foreign assistance soon, it
is expected to start printing more rubles to pay off millions of
workers and pensioners who haven't received their money for months.
	   But the additional money is almost certain to push inflation
higher and would risk bringing back the hyperinflation that Russia
suffered during the early 1990s.
	   Russia's problems could get worse next year when its dlrs 17.5
billion dollar foreign debt falls due. Several officials have
already said the country won't be able to meet these payments and
have called for creditors to set new terms for payment.

Geremek warns lack of goodwill threatens OSCE mission in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A lack of goodwill in Kosovo threatens the
``very difficult'' mission of unarmed foreign observers sent by the
European diplomatic alliance, Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek
said Friday.
	   Geremek, the outgoing chairman of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, called the Kosovo mission a crucial step
for the Vienna-based organization that seeks to quell conflict
throughout Europe.
	   ``The success of the mission seems now to be blocked by a lack
of goodwill of all participants,'' he told a news conference after
returning from an OSCE conference in Oslo, Norway. ``The mission
faces a very difficult task.''
	   The 2,000-strong OSCE mission, still being set up, will try to
verify if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is complying with
agreements he reached with U.S. envoys and the OSCE to halt
violence in Kosovo and start political negotiations.
	   Under the agreements, Milosevic has removed some Yugoslav troops
and Serb police from the restive Serb province where the ethnic
Albanian majority seeks independence.
	   A crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists that began in
February led to fighting that killed hundreds and forced 300,000
people from their homes. Fearing a humanitarian catastrophe, NATO
threatened air strikes on Milosevic's forces in October to force
him to agree to halt his offensive and allow international
organizations to feed and shelter displaced people.
	   Most of the refugees have returned to their homes or villages,
but sporadic violence by ethnic Albanian guerrillas and Serb and
Yugoslav forces continues. In the latest incidents, Yugoslav border
guards killed eight ethnic Albanians on Thursday.
	   Efforts by U.S. diplomats to start political talks have stalled,
though some progress occurred this week when the ethnic Albanian
guerrillas softened their demand for independence by accepting the
principle of an interim period of autonomy.
	   Geremek, a veteran of Poland's Solidarity movement that ousted
communist rule in 1989, called the shift by the rebels a positive
sign.
	   He called Kosovo ``the biggest challenge for the OSCE and also
the biggest chance to show that it is a necessary organization in
Europe.'' While the humanitarian crisis has been avoided, he said
``everything or almost everything is still to be done'' in building
trust and democratic institutions in the region.
	   Asked about Poland's role as the OSCE revolving chairman for the
past year, Geremek said the experience raised Poland's profile and
prestige in the changing political climate of Europe.
	   Poland will next year join the Czech Republic and Hungary as the
first three former Soviet bloc countries to join NATO, their former
enemy.
	   ``Thanks to the OSCE chairmanship, Poland enters NATO as a
country with an important position,'' he said. ``It has become an
attractive political partner.''

Netanyahu defends position in talks with Albright
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Arafat spokesman saying the
Palestinians will continue to honor the agreement despite Israeli
suspension, clashes between Palestinians and settlers, Palestinian
Cabinet to vote on next step in the accord &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Palestinians will forge ahead with their
part of the Wye River land-for-security agreement despite Israel's
decision to suspend implementation, a senior aide to Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat said Friday.
	   In a next step, the Palestinian Cabinet was to meet later Friday
to discuss preparations for a Dec. 14 meeting in Gaza City _ to be
attended by U.S. President Bill Clinton _ that is to usher in the
second stage of the peace agreement.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced earlier this
week that he would not carry his obligations until Arafat dropped
plans to unilaterally declare a state next year and accepted
Israel's criteria for the release of prisoners.
	   Netanyahu charged that since the agreement was signed Oct. 23,
``we have seen a constant attempt by the Palestinians to erode the
agreement, to ignore the agreement, or to violate it flagrantly.''
	   The Clinton administration was angered by Netanyahu's decision,
but also believes the crisis is not genuine and will be resolved
before Clinton's arrival, the Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot said
Friday, quoting unidentified U.S. officials.
	   Criticizing Israel, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin
has said the Wye agreement should be implemented as signed.
	   On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called
Netanyahu to discuss the dispute.
	   Netanyahu told her that he was not imposing new conditions, but
simply insisting that the Wye agreement be carried out in full,
said Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan.
	   ``I think the main misunderstanding was that the Cabinet
decision was interpreted as new conditions,'' said Bar-Illan. ``The
prime minister explained that (he was insisting) on compliance with
commitments made as long as five years ago.''
	   However, Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi said Netanyahu created the
crisis to appease hard-liners and strengthen his shaky coalition.
	   In response to the suspension of the accord, hawkish legislators
withdrew their support for an early elections bill that was to have
been brought before parliament Monday.
	   The Palestinians demanded Friday that Israel resume
implementation. ``As for the Palestinian Authority, it has and will
continue to implement its part of Wye River agreement,'' said
Arafat spokesman Nabil Abourdeneh.
	   On Friday evening, the Palestinian Cabinet and the PLO Executive
Committee were to discuss procedures for convening the Palestine
National Council, the Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, and
various Palestinian groups on Dec. 14.
	   On that day, the PNC and the other groups are to ``reaffirm'' a
letter to Clinton in which Arafat declares that clauses of the PLO
founding charter calling for Israel's destructions are null and
void. The session is being convened as part of the Wye accord.
	   In other developments Friday, Palestinians briefly clashed with
Jewish settlers and Israeli troops in two land protests.
	   In one incident near the Jewish settlement of Ateret, some 50
Palestinians from the village of Umm Safa blocked an access road
with rocks and a washing machine to protest the expropriation of
village land. Palestinians stoned a settler bus, but no one was
hurt. Soldiers in a jeep accompanying the bus fired in the air.
	   Near the West Bank village of Turmus Ayya, some 100 Palestinians
held Muslim prayers on land slated for expropriation by Israel.
Four settlers arrived and fired in the air, and the Palestinians
gradually dispersed.
	   Also Friday, a spokesman for Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon said the minister was to leave this weekend for meetings
with Albright and senior Clinton administration officials in
Washington. The first item on the agenda will be the latest crisis
with the Palestinians, said Sharon spokesman Raanan Gissin.
	   Sharon will also raise his ideas for a permanent peace agreement
with the Palestinians. Such an accord would have to set final
borders and determine the status of Jerusalem.
	   Sharon reportedly hopes to postpone the May 1999 deadline for
reaching agreement, and compensate the Palestinians by granting
them near-independence in the areas they already control.
	   Final status negotiations were formally launched last month, but
the real work has not yet begun.
	   Clinton will discuss final status proposals separately with
Netanyahu and Arafat when he arrives in the region Dec. 12 in what
would be the first serious deliberations on the subject, the
Haaretz daily said.

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ A Palestinian university student who
participated in an attack on an Israeli soldier and seized his M-16
assault rifle has been arrested, a senior Palestinian official said
Friday.
	   The rifle was handed over to the governor of the West Bank town
of Ramallah, Mustafa Issa, on Wednesday night, several hours after
about a dozen Palestinians pelted an Israeli car with stones,
pulled the soldier out of the vehicle and struck him repeatedly in
the head with rocks.
	   The soldier escaped with head injuries. The incident, captured
by TV cameras, triggered an outrage in Israel and led to Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to suspend the upcoming West
Bank troop withdrawal.
	   The Palestinian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the M-16 was handed over by Palestinian university students
not involved in the attack on the soldier.
	   One of the students was held for questioning, however, and later
the student who had seized the M-16 was arrested.
	   The army spokesman's office said the Palestinian Authority had
pledged to take steps against those involved in the attack.
	   A preliminary Israeli army investigation into the incident has
found that the soldier under attack, Cpl. Assaf Meyara, 19, should
have fired on his assailants, the Yediot Ahronot daily said.
	   Meyara will likely be charged in military court with violating
army procedures, the newspaper said.
	   However, the army spokesman's office said that although Meyera
did violate army procedure by carrying a weapon that was unloaded,
the investigation was still ongoing as to whether he should have
loaded it and opened fire.
	   Israel and the Palestinians have blamed each other for the
violence, which came days before U.S. President Bill Clinton was to
arrive in the region to usher in the second stage of the Wye River
land-for-security agreement.

Bosnian Muslims demonstrate for Muslim control of disputed city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ More than 10,000 Bosnian
Muslims rallied in four cities Friday to demand that international
arbitrators grant a key disputed city to Muslim authorities.
	   Emotional protesters jammed traffic in Sarajevo and Tuzla and
claimed high turnouts in the towns of Zenica and Bihac as they
called on international authorities to return the northern port
town of Brcko to its pre-war status as a Muslim-dominated area.
	   Arbitrators say they'll decide in the next few weeks the fate of
Brcko, which is currently supervised by American Robert Farrand and
claimed by both Muslims and Bosnian Serbs. The decision has already
been delayed three times as arbitrators fear upsetting Bosnia's
uneasy peace.
	   During Bosnia's 3 1/2 year war, Serb fighters drove out most
Muslims from Brcko, 75 kilometers (45 miles) north of Sarajevo. The
city is now predominantly Serb although about 2,000 Muslims have
returned since the war ended with the Dayton accords in 1995.
	   Control of the town on the River Sava is the only territorial
issue not settled by the accords.
	   Both sides have threatened to resume fighting if control goes to
the other.
	   In Sarajevo Friday, Bosnia's Muslim member of the joint
presidency, Alija Izetbegovic, joined the four-city protest dubbed
``Brcko to its citizens.'' Izetbegovic threatens to resign if Brcko
is given to Serbs.

Arafat expected to make strong policy statement in Stockholm

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is
expected to present a major policy statement on working out a final
peace agreement with Israel during a visit to the Swedish capital
Saturday, an official said.
	   The stated reason for Arafat's trip is to attend a meeting
commemorating the 10th anniversary of Arafat's statement in
Stockholm recognizing Israel's right to exist.
	   ``Arafat will, in his talk ... put forward principles for final
negotiations and they can be expected to get wide support,'' Sten
Andersson, chairman of the Olof Palme Center that arranged the
meeting, was quoted as saying by the Swedish news agency TT.
	   Swedish and Israeli diplomats confirmed on Friday that
unofficial talks between Israeli and Palestinian representatives
have been taking place in Stockholm since 1994. Arafat's speech is
expected to build on those talks.
	   ``The talks have taken place with a certain regularity,''
Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh said Friday ``They hang
together _ the Oslo process and these talks.''
	   Israel will be represented at the meeting by Meir Sheetrit,
group leader in parliament for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
governing coalition and Yossi Beilin, a top member of Israel's main
opposition Labor Party.
	   Although Israel's representation is not on Arafat's level in
terms of protocol, Beilin is an influential figure as one of the
architects of the Oslo Accord treaty between Israel and the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
	   Beilin has also been involved in the ongoing talks in Sweden,
Israeli Embassy spokesman Shlomo Morgan said. The unofficial
discussions also reportedly included influential Palestinian
academics.
	   Andersson, who was foreign minister during Arafat's visit in
1988, declined to give details on what the Palestinian leader might
say.
	   ``This is Arafat's matter,'' Andersson said.
	   Among the most critical issues in the collapsing peace process
is whether Arafat will declare a separate Palestinian state. He
claims the Oslo Accord allows him to do so as of early May 1999,
but the document's wording on the matter is vague.
	   Israel this week suspended its troop withdrawals from the West
Bank until the Palestinians meet a series of demands including
publicly abandoning intentions to declare a state in May.

Police say they will not raid Olympic village
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ New South Wales state police said
Friday they have no intention of raiding the Olympic Village over
suspected personal use of sports drugs by athletes during the
Sydney 2000 Games.
	   Police issued a statement Friday denying newspaper reports that
the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) had discussed searches on
the athletes' village with police.
	   ``The NSW police service wishes to make clear that it has had no
discussions with the Australian Olympic Committee regarding drug
searches in the Athletes Village during the Sydney 2000 Olympic and
Paralympic Games,'' the statement said.
	   Lesley Honeyman, the deputy director of intelligence at the
Olympic Security Command Center, said raids on the Olympic Village
and other 2000 Games venues for personal-use amounts of drugs would
breach police protocol.
	   ``The (police) policy is that use of a performance enhancing
drug is not a law enforcement priority, Honeyman said. (djp)

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A former spokesman for Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki was sentenced Friday to seven years in prison
for homicide and drunken and reckless driving.
	   Thami Ntenteni, who had been out on bail, was immediately taken
into custody. His lawyers said they would appeal the sentence,
which stems from his killing one woman and seriously injuring three
other people in a December 1997 car crash.
	   Ntenteni had pleaded guilty September.
	   At the time of the crash, he had been the spokesman for Mbeki,
who will likely become South Africa's next president after the 1999
elections. Ntenteni has since been suspended from his job.

	   MANNHEIM, Germany (AP) _ A bankrupt concert promoter was ordered
Friday to pay tenor Jose Carreras 400,000 marks (dlrs 240,000) for
two 1997 performances, but even the judge admitted the singer was
unlikely to see any of it.
	   Concert promoter Matthias Hoffmann's company has gone bankrupt
since Carreras performed last year in Fulda and Hanover, and is
jailed on suspicion of tax evasion.
	   Hoffmann had put off paying the debt citing financial
difficulties, and his defense argued that Carreras had deferred
payment.
	   The state court ordered payment of the full fee, with interest.
	   ``It's pretty sure the money's not there,'' said chief Judge
Bernfried von Loebbecke.

Pat Cash rips British middle class for `lack of guts'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Australian tennis star Pat Cash has ripped
the state of British tennis, saying it's a middle-class game in
which the English ``don't have the stomach for a fight.''
	   Although two British players _ Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski _
finished the year in the top 10, Cash said the game needs a
tougher, working-class image.
	   ``Tim Henman's a very nice guy and a very good player but he has
that comfortable, middle-class look about him,'' the 1987 Wimbledon
champion was quoted as saying in Friday's Daily Mail. ``The only
English player who seems gutsy enough is Greg Rusedski and that
shows what I mean, because is Canadian. Rusedski is the hungry one.
He hasn't Tim's flair but he's as tough as anybody.
	   ``What tennis needs is some working-class icons, street kids
made good and who people can identify with,'' Cash said, citing
England soccer players Ian Wright and Paul Gascoigne as examples.
	   ``Even in Australia tennis is regarded as a sport for sissies
but guys like me and Pat Rafter have shown that we have the
competitive edge you need.
	   ``Over here, tennis is viewed in the same way, and no one has
done much to change that. The snobby image of the All England Club
and Queen's Club is not much help either. If you can alter that
image then you'll see an Ian Wright come through.''
	   Cash said tennis and cricket in Britain both suffer from the
same problem.
	   ``The thing about Australians is that we're always competitive
and always play hard,'' he said. ``With the English you never know
if they've got guts. ... The English middle class basically don't
have the stomach for a fight.''
	   Cash is currently playing in the ATP Tour Seniors event in
London.

Government uses emergency decree to end customs strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with mobilization order, union
saying it will go back to work. No pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Premier Costas Simitis resorted to a rare
civic emergency decree Friday to force customs workers to end a
strike that has dried up fuel supplies in Greece and left many
without heating oil.
	   Simitis signed an order for a ``civil mobilization,'' which
allows the government to draft Greeks into service during times of
national crisis. Such orders are usually reserved for times of war.
	   The decree shows the determination of Simitis' government not to
give in to labor protests against measures designed to earn Greece
a spot in the European Union's single currency group by 2001.
	   The walkout by members of the main customs workers' union was
intended to force the government to back down on plans to unify
Greece's nearly 200 state pension funds.
	   Strikers ignoring Simitis' order face immediate arrest. Customs
workers denounced the decision, but said they would return to work.
	   ``We will comply. We can't appeal something like this in court.
It's impossible,'' said union spokesman Ilias Roussakis.
	   The strike, which began Monday, has left more than 2 million
vehicles without fuel and hundreds of trucks stranded at the border
as temperatures have fallen to near freezing in some mountainous
parts of northern Greece.
	   The work stoppage also forced the closure Friday of the main
landfill serving greater Athens.
	   Once customs officers return to work, it will take at least two
days to fully replenish the fuel market.
	   Most of Greece's gasoline and heating oil arrives in Greece via
non-EU nations. Goods shipped from EU partners were not affected by
the strike.
	   The government estimated the strike cost Greece 8 billion
drachmas (dlrs 28.3 million) a day.
	   The customs protest added to the misery caused by a broad array
of strikes against government austerity plans.
	   In Athens, the fuel crunch had one positive result: easing the
city's chronic traffic jams.

Chief U.N. weapons inspector in Russia to discuss Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Visiting chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler discussed the Iraqi crisis with top Russian officials
Friday, Russian news reports said.
	   Butler, who heads the U.N. Special Commission charged with
making sure Iraq dismantles its weapons of mass destruction, met
with Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor Posuvalyuk, who oversees Iraq
and other Mideast countries.
	   Butler was scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
later Friday, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The Russian government has staunchly opposed the use of force
against Iraq and called for a peaceful solution, while urging Iraq
to fully cooperate with U.N weapons inspectors.
	   Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz is expected to arrive in
Moscow on Sunday for a four-day visit that will include a meeting
with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, the Russian Foreign Ministry
said in a statement Friday.
	   On Thursday, Aziz accused U.N. weapons inspectors of providing
enemy intelligence agencies with information obtained from its
weapons searches. Aziz called on U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
to stop such contacts.
	   Aziz and the Russians will discuss the situation in Iraq,
``particularly in the context of a comprehensive review by the U.N.
Security Council of the fulfillment of its resolutions by
Baghdad,'' the statement said.
	   The U.N. weapons inspectors must certify that Iraq has complied
with U.N. resolutions calling for the dismantling of the country's
nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and long-range missiles
before the Security Council can lift crippling economic sanctions
imposed after Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Baghdad has accused the Special Commission of working on behalf
of the United States to prolong the sanctions.
	   Iraq's recent refusal to cooperate with weapons inspectors
prompted the United States and Britain to threaten a military
strike. Responding to the threat, Iraq agreed Nov. 14 to resume
cooperation with weapons inspectors.
	   Moscow, which is owed billions of dollars from Iraq in debt left
over from Soviet times, is generally sympathetic to the Arab nation
and has called for an early lifting of the sanctions.

Tyson registers as sex offender
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ Mike Tyson registered himself as a sex offender
in the western U.S. state of Arizona as part of his planned move to
Phoenix.
	   Tyson went to the Maricopa County Sheriff's office Thursday to
be fingerprinted and photographed. He was convicted of raping a
beauty pageant contestant in 1992 in the midwestern state of
Indiana.
	   Tyson has been living in Scottsdale, Arizona, and training in
Phoenix, but his neighbors will not be notified when he chooses a
permanent residence. That's because the a law allowing law
enforcement officials to notify communties of the presence of a sex
offender did not go into affect until after his conviction.
	   Tyson pleaded no contest in Maryland on Tuesday to misdemeanor
assault for his role in a scuffle after a traffic accident.
	   Meanwhile, Tyson's probation officer will file court papers by
Monday in Indiana that could lead to the former heavyweight boxing
champion returning to prison.
	   George Walker, the chief probation officer for Marion Superior
Court, said Thursday it appears Tyson violated terms of his
probation as a result of his no-contest plea.

Honduras declares national alert for epidemics after Mitch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Honduras declared a state of
national alert on Friday because of epidemics in the wake of
Hurricane Mitch. Officials said the most serious included malaria,
diarrhea, cholera and leptospirosis.
	   ``The epidemics are already in the country, and we have to take
them on with the few resources we have,'' said Public Health
Minister Marco Antonio Rosa.
	   Twenty thousand people have cholera, 31,000 have malaria and
208,000 have diarrhea, health officials said. Leptospirosis, a
disease spread by rodents that causes liver and kidney failure, has
infected 62 people, killing four of them.
	   ``The epidemics have sprung up because many cities were under
water and mud, which caused the rats and other animals to come out
of their hiding places and into the streets,'' Rosa said.
	   The waters destroyed more than 200,000 homes, leaving 10 percent
of Honduras' 6.1 million people homeless.
	   Since the government has little heavy machinery, many
neighborhoods are still covered in muck. The army and about 300,000
college students are cleaning houses by hand, but it is a slow
process.
	   The government says Mitch, which struck at the end of October,
killed 5,657 people in Honduras. The death toll throughout Central
America is more than 9,000.

France uneasy over Dalai Lama visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac, responding to
accusations he had not included the Dalai Lama in a luncheon with
other Nobel laureates next week, said Friday he had not yet heard
from the Tibetan spiritual leader.
	   The respected dailies Le Monde and Liberation reported Friday
that the Dalai Lama had not been invited to the luncheon meeting of
12 Nobel laureates gathering Dec. 8 at the Elysee to celebrate the
50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader won the Nobel peace in 1989.
	   ``For many years, I've maintained a confident dialogue with the
Dalai Lama in a way we both consider to be appropriate,'' Chirac
said, speaking after a Franco-British summit in the Brittany town
of Saint-Malo.
	   ``I asked him if, given his current relationship with Beijing,
he wished to be present. I'm waiting for his answer,'' Chirac said.
	   Chirac's remarks were widely regarded as an effort to downplay a
growing crisis over the Dalai Lama's official presence in France,
which is actively seeking to establish commercial ties with China.
	   The Dalai Lama has been at odds with China since 1959 when he
fled to India. Since then he has headed a government in exile
fighting for Tibetan autonomy.
	   According to French media reports, China may have pressured
Chirac not to receive the Dalai Lama.
	   Jack Lang, president of the National Assembly's commission on
foreign affairs, said Friday he maintained his invitation to
Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng.
	   Lang, the former Socialist culture minister, said he hoped the
Dalai Lama would be welcomed ``without restrictions, without
reserve in Paris.''
	   ``The protection of freedom is an absolute duty which must
prevail over mercantile interests,'' Lang said. ``Dictatorships and
oppressive regimes respect only those democratic countries which
stand up to them.''

Lithuanian president calls for campaign to reduce high suicide rate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) - Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus
has called for a national effort to reduce Lithuania's suicide
rate, which is one of the world's highest.
	   About 1,700 people in the country of 3.7 million have committed
suicide so far this year, or around 45 suicides per 100,000 people,
presidential spokeswoman Violeta Gaizauskaite said Friday.
	   Lithuania's suicide rate is among the highest in the world and
about four times higher than the rate in the United States,
according to the United Nations Development Program.
	   ``The president is naturally very concerned about the welfare of
Lithuanians, and looking at these kinds of suicide figures is very,
very unpleasant,'' said Gaizauskaite.
	   Adamkus this week asked various private institutes and
government agencies to develop a nationwide suicide prevention
program, Gaizauskaite said.
	   The suicide rate has increased dramatically since Lithuania
broke with the Soviet Union in 1991 and began implementing its
free-market reforms.
	   The suicide rate rose more than 70 percent from 1990 to 1995,
and is particularly high among men, who account for more than 80
percent of all suicides in Lithuania, the UNDP reported.
	   Neighboring Latvia and Estonia have similarly high rates of
suicide.
	   The Baltic nations are considered the top economic performers of
the former Soviet Union, but the dynamic growth in the three
countries has been accompanied by greater economic disparities.
	   The UNDP speculated that increased poverty, especially in the
countryside, and an increase in alcoholism may be contributing
factors in the rising number of suicides in the Baltic states.

	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Ethiopia started a polio
immunization campaign Friday and 8 million children under five are
expected to be vaccinated.
	   Some 90,000 health workers and volunteers will carry out the
exercise in 30,000 vaccination posts.
	   A month ago, about 9 million children were to be vaccinated but
the Ministry of Health is yet to say how many were actually
treated.
	   In a similar campaign a year ago, 6.4 million children were
vaccinated. The target had been 8 million, the Ministry of Health
then said.

Fresh all-party talks in Zambia open with acrimony
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ The government and opposition groups
reopened talks Friday for the first time since a 1997 coup attempt,
with sharp differences quickly emerging between the main parties.
	   President Frederick Chiluba opening the meeting of 22 political
organizations by declaring his ruling party was not obliged to
``consult or share with anyone the right to govern.''
	   But former President Kenneth Kaunda denounced Chiluba's rule was
undemocratic, pointing out that opposition parties had boycotted
the 1996 elections to protest amendments to Zambia's constitution.
	   Among the amendments was one barring first-generation Zambians
from running for president. That amendment prevented Kaunda, leader
of the main opposition United National Independence Party, from
running because his parents were immigrants from neighboring
Malawi.
	   ``The claim that you are mandated through a parliamentary vote
and presidential vote misses the point that the 1996 constitution
was discriminatory,'' Kaunda told Chiluba.
	   The talks are aimed at defusing tension between the government
and opposition parties over the constitutional amendments.
	   Kaunda's opposition alliance has also accused the government of
condoning irregularities in the registration of voters ahead of the
1996 national elections.
	   Political tensions culminated in an Oct. 28, 1997, coup attempt
by junior officers who stormed the state broadcast center and
claimed to have overthrown Chiluba. Loyal troops quickly crushed
the revolt.
	   Kaunda was placed under house arrest for alleged involvement in
the failed coup. He was freed in June after the state dropped
treason and conspiracy charges against him.
	   Kaunda, 74, led the nation to independence from Britain in 1964.
He headed an authoritarian regime until he was ousted by Chiluba in
the first democratic elections in 1991.

Committee criticizes Israel, Canada on rights issues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Non-Jews in Israel are treated as second-class
citizens, while some people are living in sub-human conditions, a
U.N. rights panel said Friday.
	   Israel's emphasis on being the Jewish state ``encourages
discrimination and accords a second-class status to its non-Jewish
citizens,'' said the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights said Friday.
	   The committee criticized Canada for permitting poverty and
homelessness, and for the conditions in which its native population
lives.
	   Israeli officials said the government had made ``tangible and
costly progress'' in combating inequality and that the campaign
would continue. But they conceded that sometimes Palestinians
suffer economically because of security clampdowns necessary to
fight terrorism.
	   The Israeli report arrived three years late, and the committee
said it still had not received the information it needed on the
situation in the West Bank and Gaza. Despite Israeli objections, it
said the government is at least partly responsible for areas under
Palestinian control.
	   ``The committee notes with concern that the government of Israel
does not accord equal rights to its Arab citizens,'' the committee
says in its observations on the report.
	   ``This discriminatory attitude is apparent in the comparatively
lower standard of living of the Israeli Arabs.''
	   The committee is particularly critical of the plight of Jahalin
Bedouin, who it says were forcibly evicted from their ancestral
lands.
	   ``The committee deplores the manner in which the government of
Israel has housed these families in a garbage dump in Abu Dis under
subhuman living conditions.''
	   In a list of 15 recommendations and suggestions, the committee
calls for equality of treatment for all Israeli citizens, respect
for the right to self-determination and recognition of the rights
of Arab Bedouin villages to basic services including water.
	   The committee also looked at the situation in Switzerland,
Germany and Cyprus. For all three countries comments were made
about the problems facing women and the high level of domestic
violence.
	   The panel, consisting of 18 independent experts, meets annually
to review how countries in the 137-nation International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights have met their commitment to
assure an adequate standard of living to their citizens.

Fearing local elections upheaval, Nigerian police tighten security
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRANK AIGBOGUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Borders were being sealed and anti-riot
policemen cruised the streets ahead of Saturday's local government
elections seen as a key first step in Nigeria's planned transition
from military rule to democracy next year.
	   More than 50 million people are registered to vote for 8,000
municipal government posts throughout the oil rich country, which
is Africa's most populous. Nine parties have registered for the
elections, three of which have fielded candidates nationwide.
	   Although on Friday there was no sign of elections violence,
authorities were not taking chances. More than 100,000 officers
were being deployed at voting stations across the country to ensure
peaceful voting.
	   It is the first vote since Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar outlined
his plan earlier this year to hand over power to civilians next May
after presidential elections on February 15.
	   Saturday's poll is a key test run. The national electoral
commission is inexperienced and the political parties have vague
platforms and are relatively unknown. Any party that fails to pick
up at least 5 percent of the vote in 24 of Nigeria's 36 states will
be eliminated from the ballot for the presidential poll.
	   Abubakar, who took control in June following the death of the
late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, has promised the military will not
intervene in the transition. Nigeria has a history of armed coups
and military meddling in politics. The country has been ruled by
civilians for only 10 years since independence in 1960.
	   But Abubakar has also warned that parties that campaign on
divisive ethnic lines will be barred from the presidential poll.
	   Simmering ethnic tensions prompted authorities to cancel polling
in a number of towns and villages in oil-rich southwestern Nigeria,
including several communities near the oil port town of Warri,
about 200 kilometers (125 miles) southeast of Lagos, where sporadic
fighting between Ijaw and Itsekiri youths continues.
	   Elsewhere, thousands of police and soldiers were deployed in
major cities, including more than 9,000 riot squad officers aiding
regular patrolmen in the sprawling commercial capital of Lagos.
	   All of Nigeria's land borders were expected to be sealed by
Friday night in order to head off concerns of political parties
ferrying in foreigners to vote fraudulently.
	   Abubakar was expected to make an appeal for calm in a national
television address later on Friday evening.
	   Since official campaigns began last week, colorful ads promising
jobs and ethnic representation have quickly filled radio and
television airwaves and crowds of people have followed cars blaring
election promises on loudspeakers.
	   No firm favorites have emerged for the presidential poll,
although former military ruler Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo has sought
the leadership of the Peoples' Democratic Party, whose members also
include Nigeria's last civilian vice-president Alex Akueme.
	   Obasanjo, who came to power in 1976 after a failed coup attempt
took the life of military leader Gen. Murtala Muhammed,
relinquished power and retired in 1979.

Perec prepares comeback after year out of action

	   PARIS (AP) _ Three-time Olympic champion Marie-Jose Perec is
ready to resume training after serious injury and illness, the
track star said in a newspaper interview published Friday.
	   The French sprinter has had terrible luck since the 1997 World
Championships in Athens, where she injured a hamstring while
preparing for the 200-meter semifinal race.
	   Perec hoped to make a comeback this season, but has not appeared
since contracting mononucleosis in July.
	   But recent medical tests proved encouraging, and Perec told the
sports daily L'Equipe that she will soon travel to Los Angeles to
resume training with her coach John Smith.
	   ``I will join him soon, though the date is not fixed,'' Perec
was quoted as saying. ``Everything is in order.''
	   Perec said that she is not interested in competing in indoor
events this season, but that she remains confident of a return to
the top level.
	   ``I have total confidence in my body,'' she said. ``I don't
really think that I have had two wasted years. I have not trained
for six months, that's all.''
	   Perec said she was exhausted after the Atlanta Olympics, where
she won gold in the 200 and 400 meters events.
	   ``I attempted to win a double at the Olympics and few people can
imagine what that represents,'' she said. ``But my illness in 1998
had nothing to do with that.''

Chiefs vow not to repeat ugliness of last game with Broncos
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ One of the American National Football League's
best rivalries deteriorated during its most recent renewal when
several Kansas City Chiefs lost control. Don't expect it to happen
again on Sunday in Denver.
	   Three weeks ago, in a 30-7 loss to the Broncos, a flurry of
late-game personal fouls against the Chiefs led to the suspension
of linebacker Derrick Thomas and the firing of linebacker Wayne
Simmons. Chiefs management expressed its embarrassment with the
conduct.
	   Coach Marty Schottenheimer promised there would be no repeat of
the facemask-pulling and late hits, and even spoke with Denver
coach Mike Shanahan about the string of incidents.
	   ``You go back to some of the things that happened, we both
agreed that we'd rather not see them happen,'' Schottenheimer said.
``We don't think anybody's out to get anybody. But it has become a
very competitive thing, because of the quality of play.''
	   Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe, who admitted his chattering
helped ignite the late-game ugliness, was more contrite this week.
In fact, he seemed repentant before turning silent.
	   Sharpe said the incidents in Kansas City were ``really childish
... on both of our parts'' and that ``maybe I shouldn't have said
some of the things I said (to Thomas).
	   ``I would hate to let one incident ruin eight years of
friendship,'' he added.
	   The Broncos have other things on their mind, anyway, such as an
unbeaten season. They can become only the third 13-0 team in NFL
history with a victory _ and they just don't lose at home: the
Broncos have won 22 straight at Mile High Stadium.
	   A Denver victory also secures home-field advantage throughout
the playoffs.
	   Schottenheimer understands what kind of challenge his Chiefs
(5-7) are facing.
	   ``The game is going to be played and it will be a physical,
hard-fought contest,'' he said. ``That isn't going to change. It
doesn't matter what the point differential is or anything else. For
us to have an opportunity to beat Denver, we have to play at our
very best. That means no fouls, no personal fouls.''
	   Among the teams on the verge of clinching playoff berths this
weekend are Dallas, which is at New Orleans; Green Bay, which plays
at Tampa Bay on Monday night; and San Francisco, which is at
Carolina.
	   Also on the schedule is Buffalo at Cincinnati; Detroit at
Jacksonville; Indianapolis at Atlanta; New England at Pittsburgh;
San Diego at Washington; Seattle at the New York Jets; the New York
Giants at Arizona; Miami at Oakland; Baltimore at Tennessee; and
Chicago at Minnesota.
	   On Thursday night, Philadelphia spoiled the return to Veterans
Stadium of former Eagles coach Dick Vermiel by beating his St.
Louis Rams 17-14. Vermeil _ who came out of retirement last year _
took the Eagles to the Super Bowl after the 1980 season, then quit
after 1982.
	   If the Cowboys beat the Saints, they earn a playoff spot. If the
Cardinals lose to the Giants and Dallas victory, the NFC East
division crown goes to the Cowboys.
	   Both Green Bay and San Francisco get in with a victory or a loss
by Detroit.
	   Minnesota can take the NFC Central title by winning, or if Green
Bay loses. If both Dallas and Green Bay fall, a Vikings victory
gives them a first-round bye.
	   Also already having clinched a playoff berth with Denver and
Minnesota is Atlanta.

Embattled Stuttgart coach resigns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more quotes, details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Winfried Schaefer, the embattled coach
of Stuttgart, on Friday became the fifth Bundesliga coach to lose
his job this season, stepping down in face of a player rebellion.
	   ``I give up, it makes no sense anymore,'' Schaefer told the
Cologne newspaper Express, shortly before a news conference at the
club.
	   At the news conference, Stuttgart chairman Gerhard
Mayer-Vorfelder confirmed Schaefer's departure. The coach was not
present.
	   Schaefer lost a power struggle with some of the top stars of the
club.
	   Earlier this week, he dropped Bulgarian midfielder Krasimir
Balakov from the roster and left striker Fredi Bobic on the bench
for Tuesday's German Cup match against Bayern Munich. Bobic came on
in the second half, but Stuttgart lost 3-0.
	   The dispute erupted into a public battle through the media.
	   Bobic criticized the coach on television. Schaefer replied that
some players were ``dumb and without respect.''
	   This prompted defender Thomas Berthold to demand Schaefer's
departure Friday.
	   ``Either five or six players will leave or they have to get rid
of the coach,'' said Berthold, a former German international.
	   Schaefer was hired at the start of the season but never won the
acceptance of players and was detested by the fans, having come
from the bitter regional rival Karlsruhe. He was fired from
Karlsruhe, which was relegated at the end of last season.
	   There was speculation that Schaefer would move on to Nuremberg,
whose coach Willi Reimann resigned earlier this week for family
reasons.
	   Assistant coach Wolfgang Rolff will take over temporarily while
Stuttgart seeks for another coach.

EU ministers back task force to coordinate asylum policy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union justice and interior
ministers Friday agreed to set up a task force to coordinate ways
of handling the increasing flow of asylum seekers and illegal
immigrants into the 15-nation bloc.
	   The special unit would pool ideas on how to limit the influx and
ensure EU nations share more evenly the task of receiving them.
	   ``The solidarity of Europe should not be an empty phrase but
should become a concrete and effective policy,'' said Italy's
Interior Minister Rosa Jervolino-Russo, who country is a favored
port of entry for refugees coming form the Balkans, the Middle East
and Asia.
	   The plan for the task force, first tabled by the Netherlands in
October, is expected to be formally approved by EU foreign affairs
ministers on Monday. The force should present a report on proposed
joint-EU measures to a special summit on the issue scheduled for
October 1999 in Tampere, Finland.
	   Several member states, including Italy, Britain, Belgium,
Germany and the Netherlands have all faced big increases in asylum
applicants over the past year. Some have set up tented villages to
house them while asylum demands are processed.
	   ``This is an area where work with our European partners is
essential,'' said British Home Secretary Jack Straw. Asylum
applications have risen 30 percent this year in Britain compared to
1997 and stand at 33,000 for the first ten months of 1998 alone.
	   In Belgium application are up by 57 percent this year and
Justice Minister Tony Van Parijs said it was ``essential to come to
quick agreement.'' Belgium was forced to change its asylum policy
in October amid outrage over the death of a Nigerian woman during a
deportation attempt.
	   Overall Germany is the biggest recipient nation, processing some
30 percent of the EU's asylum cases. In November alone, 10,800 new
demands were entered.
	   Often, asylum seekers claiming persecution at home are deemed to
have fled for economic reasons. Of 12,208 asylum demands wrapped up
by German authorities in November, just 423 or 3.5 percent were
accepted.
	   In France and Belgium, refugees without proper papers have taken
shelter in churches. In the Netherlands, dozens of illegal
immigrants launched a hunger strike this week in a last-ditch
attempt to pressure Dutch officials to grant them residency
permits.
	   Refugees seeking asylum in western European from Yugoslavia have
doubled this year and now stand at some 5,600 a month.
	   Among the tasks to be taken on the force will be looking at how
the EU can improve the situation for potential asylum seekers in
their country of origin.

Yeltsin meets prime minister in hospital, no word on release
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with no date set for Yeltsin's return to work in 5th
graf, spokesman denying suggestions that Primakov has taken over
presidential functions in grafs 11-14. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin, who remains hospitalized with
pneumonia, met Friday with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who
advised the president to make a full recovery before returning to
the Kremlin.
	   Primakov told the president, who is known to be a restless
patient, not to rush his return to work, said presidential
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin.
	   Yeltsin was admitted to the hospital on Nov. 22 _ almost two
weeks ago _ and Yakushkin declined to say when he might be
released.
	   Other aides said this week that the president may return to work
at the Kremlin on Monday, but Yakushkin refused to confirm that.
	   ``The president is eager to come back to work at the Kremlin as
early as tomorrow, but doctors don't recommend that,'' Yakushkin
said. ``Doctors are not setting any timetables'' for Yeltsin's
return to work.
	   Yeltsin has been handling paper work and talking to officials
this week. ``Boris Nikolayevich is in a very energetic mood,''
Yakushkin said.
	   Meanwhile, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, one of Russia's most
prominent politicians and a likely presidential candidate, said the
president's frequent ailments have weakened the government.
	   ``The president is ill indeed and he can work effectively only
for a small part of his working time,'' Luzhkov said in an
interview with Germany's ARD television on Thursday night. ``All of
us feel the absence of the president.''
	   However, ``even the fact that the president is in place is a
certain stabilizing factor for the society,'' Luzhkov said in
remarks that were also carried by the Interfax news agency. ``There
is no reason to see the president's health problem as equal to the
danger of the country's collapse.''
	   Yeltsin's bout of pneumonia is his second in as many years and
the latest in a string of illnesses that have eroded his authority
and raised doubts about his ability to serve out a term that ends
in 2000.
	   Primakov has taken over day-to-day economic management,
occasionally replaced Yeltsin in meetings with foreign leaders, and
otherwise kept a high profile _ prompting speculations that the
premier has effectively become acting president.
	   Yakushkin again denied such suggestions Friday.
	   ``Any transfer of the main presidential functions to Primakov is
out of the question,'' Yakushkin said. ``The president still
handles foreign policy, is still in charge of defense and security
agencies.''
	   ``True, specific economic work is handled by Primakov, and
sometimes it so happens, due to various reasons, that Primakov
replaces the president on the international arena,'' he said,
adding that Primakov is merely making full use of his powers as
prime minister.
	   Ruslan Orekhov, head of the presidential legal department,
dismissed speculation that Yeltsin was growing weaker and that the
president employs a machine, rather than his own hand, to sign
official documents.
	   ``The (machine) is never used on presidential orders,'' Orekhov
told the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda, adding that it's only used on
occasion to sign routine documents.
	   Orekhov also denied allegations that documents presented to
Yeltsin are typed in extra large letters to make them easier to
read.
	   At several public ceremonies, Yeltsin has signed documents in an
extremely slow and laborious manner, but Orekhov said this was
merely a personal habit, not a sign of weakness.

Rebels say nothing short of independence acceptable
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo
declared Friday they would not accept any peace deal short of
independence for the province, dismissing recent signals that they
could support a U.S. peace plan.
	   A statement by rebel Kosovo Liberation Army distributed to
ethnic Albanian media in Kosovo, said the guerrillas ``would not
accept any political solution which would harm the ideals of our
people toward independence, or which would cement, even
temporarily, an imposed joint life in an anti-Albanian,
anti-democratic creation as it would be Yugoslavia.''
	   The statement presents a setback for U.S. efforts to get all
Kosovo factions agree on an interim peace plan which envisages the
province loosening ties with Serbia, but does not give it full
independence.
	   A KLA political representative signaled last week the rebels
were ready to accept such a plan. But the KLA said Friday it was
``undeterred in its just fight until our independent and democratic
state is established.''
	   The group hailed international efforts at a peace agreement and
added it would publish its remarks on the American draft plan.

Netanyahu defends position in talks with Albright
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Arafat spokesman saying the
Palestinians will continue to honor the agreement despite Israeli
suspension, clashes between Palestinians and settlers, Palestinian
Cabinet to vote on next step in the accord. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Palestinians will forge ahead with their
part of the Wye River land-for-security agreement despite Israel's
decision to suspend implementation, a senior aide to Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat said Friday.
	   In a next step, the Palestinian Cabinet was to meet later Friday
to discuss preparations for a Dec. 14 meeting in Gaza City _ to be
attended by U.S. President Bill Clinton _ that is to usher in the
second stage of the peace agreement.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced earlier this
week that he was suspending a West Bank troop pullback until Arafat
dropped plans to unilaterally declare a state next year and
accepted Israel's criteria for the release of prisoners.
	   Netanyahu charged that since the agreement was signed Oct. 23,
``we have seen a constant attempt by the Palestinians to erode the
agreement, to ignore the agreement, or to violate it flagrantly.''
	   The Clinton administration was angered by Netanyahu's decision,
but also believes the crisis is not genuine and will be resolved
before Clinton's arrival, the Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot said
Friday, quoting unidentified U.S. officials.
	   Criticizing Israel, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin
has said the Wye agreement should be implemented as signed.
	   On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called
Netanyahu to discuss the dispute.
	   Netanyahu told her that he was not imposing new conditions, but
simply insisting that the Wye agreement be carried out in full,
said Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan.
	   ``I think the main misunderstanding was that the Cabinet
decision was interpreted as new conditions,'' said Bar-Illan. ``The
prime minister explained that (he was insisting) on compliance with
commitments made as long as five years ago.''
	   However, Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi said Netanyahu created the
crisis to appease hard-liners and strengthen his shaky coalition.
	   In response to the suspension of the accord, hawkish legislators
withdrew their support for an early elections bill that was to have
been brought before parliament Monday.
	   The Palestinians demanded Friday that Israel resume
implementation. ``As for the Palestinian Authority, it has and will
continue to implement its part of Wye River agreement,'' said
Arafat spokesman Nabil Abourdeneh.
	   On Friday evening, the Palestinian Cabinet and the PLO Executive
Committee were to discuss procedures for convening the Palestine
National Council, the Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, and
various Palestinian groups on Dec. 14.
	   On that day, the PNC and the other groups are to ``reaffirm'' a
letter to Clinton in which Arafat declares that clauses of the PLO
founding charter calling for Israel's destructions are null and
void. The session is being convened as part of the Wye accord.
	   In other developments Friday, Palestinians briefly clashed with
Jewish settlers and Israeli troops in two land protests.
	   In one incident near the Jewish settlement of Ateret, about 50
Palestinians from the village of Umm Safa blocked an access road
with rocks and a washing machine to protest the expropriation of
village land. Palestinians stoned a settler bus, but no one was
hurt. Soldiers in a jeep accompanying the bus fired in the air.
	   Near the West Bank village of Turmus Ayya, about 100
Palestinians held Muslim prayers on land slated for expropriation
by Israel. Four settlers arrived and fired in the air, and the
Palestinians gradually dispersed.
	   Also Friday, a spokesman for Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon said the minister was to leave this weekend for meetings
with Albright and senior Clinton administration officials in
Washington. The first item on the agenda will be the latest crisis
with the Palestinians, said Sharon spokesman Raanan Gissin.
	   Sharon will also raise his ideas for a permanent peace agreement
with the Palestinians. Such an accord would have to set final
borders and determine the status of Jerusalem.
	   Sharon reportedly hopes to postpone the May 1999 deadline for
reaching agreement, and compensate the Palestinians by granting
them near-independence in the areas they already control.
	   Final status negotiations were formally launched last month, but
the real work has not yet begun.
	   Clinton will discuss final status proposals separately with
Netanyahu and Arafat when he arrives in the region Dec. 12 in what
would be the first serious deliberations on the subject, the
Haaretz daily said.

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Rather than taking to the streets in
rebellion, thousands of Norwegian students launched a protest by
staying at their desks and inundating government computers with
E-mail this week.
	   The protesters, angry over interest rate hikes on student loans,
sent at least 200,000 messages through the Internet to leading
politicians over the past three days.
	   Protest leader Trygve Ploehn told the Oslo newspaper Dagbladet
that most of the messages were sent to Prime Minister Kjell Magne
Bondevik, who probably didn't notice. Last week, the 51-year-old
prime minister said he did not know how to use a computer.
	   But the government noticed. It called out the state telephone
company as an electronic riot police to set up data barricades
against the E-mail onslaught, Dagbladet said.

Attack-minded forward key player in Springboks record bid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ They call him the ``game-breaker.'' Now Bobby
Skinstad is set to be a record-breaker.
	   On Saturday, the 22-year-old Western Province wing forward hopes
to be part of a Springbok rugby union team that beats England to
set a world record of 18 successive Test wins.
	   ``It's an achievement and the prospect of `What if we don't make
it?' doesn't bear thinking about,'' Skinstad said Friday on the eve
of the match before 75,000 fans at Twickenham.
	   ``There's always pressure on a South African side because people
expect us to win. I'm not feeling it too badly because I haven't
been in the Test team from the start of the run. But I can see some
of the other guys are feeling the pressure.''
	   That's just what England hopes for as it aims to halt the record
streak which the Springboks now share with the 1965-69 New Zealand
All Blacks.
	   But Skinstad is fresh and exactly the sort of player who can
turn the match in his team's favor with one flash of brilliance.
	   He has only started three times for South Africa but has made
seven more appearances as substitute to turn the game and win
matches.
	   Like all back row players, Skinstad is a strong and aggressive
tackler and is always involved in the play. But he is a superb
handler of the ball, has an amazing burst of pace and sees openings
that others don't. Skinstad is like a center, fly half and back row
all rolled into one.
	   South African coach Nick Mallett, who termed the phrase
``game-breaker,'' has used Skinstad as a substitute to bring him
into games when his team needed an extra dimension, especially in
midfield.
	   He was a replacement during the victory over Wales at Wembley,
started against both Scotland and Ireland and also will face
England.
	   Francois Pienaar, a back row star who led South Africa to an
emotional 1995 World Cup triumph before losing his place on the
team, admires Skinstad's ability.
	   ``I'm sure South Africa will win and what I've seen of Bobby is
encouraging. He is a fantastic player with an incredible turn of
pace and superb handling skills,'' the former captain said.
	   Skinstad, who admires the way the French run with the ball
rather that kick for territorial advantage, sees himself as an
entertainer.
	   ``I love the fantasy and the Latin temperament and I think this
is an element of my game,'' he said. ``The French are always ready
to play with the ball in their hands.
	   ``At Western Province we try to produce the maximum of movement
to score tries and to give pleasure to the public.
	   ``The Springboks have established a formidable record, their
success based on very aggressive defense,'' Skinstad said. ``But
now opposition teams know our style very well and they dissect all
our moves, all our combinations. We are very predictable.
	   ``So it's necessary to have some players capable of coming up
with something unexpected to turn the match.
	   ``I don't know if I'm the one who can turn the match but, as the
attacks are often done through me, my style is principally to score
or set up tries,'' Skinstad said.
	   ``There are others who are stronger than me, such as (scrum
half) Joost van der Westhuizen, (winger) Pieter Roussow and
(fullback) Percy Montgomery. But right from the start, I have one
thing in mind, attacking and scoring.''

Thousands turn out for Miss World's homecoming
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NETANYA, Israel (AP) _ A jubilant crowd of thousands turned out
in the coastal town of Netanya on Friday to welcome home the newly
crowned Miss World, Linor Abargil.
	   An 18-year-old of Libyan and Moroccan extraction, Abargil won
her title last week at the Miss World contest in the Seychelles
Islands.
	   Her townsfolk _ from tots to grandparents _ waited in the main
square for the return of the brown-eyed high school graduate.
	   Wearing a crown, Abargil arrived in a black limousine followed
by a stream of motorcycles. Dozens broke through police lines for a
better view.
	   In a ceremony attended by Netanya's mayor, Abargil waved to the
cheering crowd and thanked her family and the town.
	   Abargil is due to begin 20 months of compulsory military service
in April 1999, but her family hopes the army will postpone her
induction to enable her to fulfill the year-long duties of Miss
World.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ A Palestinian university student who
participated in an attack on an Israeli soldier and seized his M-16
assault rifle has been arrested, a senior Palestinian official said
Friday.
	   The rifle was handed over to the governor of the West Bank town
of Ramallah, Mustafa Issa, on Wednesday night, several hours after
about a dozen Palestinians pelted an Israeli car with stones,
pulled the soldier out of the vehicle and struck him repeatedly in
the head with rocks.
	   The soldier escaped with head injuries. The incident, captured
by TV cameras, triggered an outrage in Israel and led to Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to suspend the upcoming West
Bank troop withdrawal.
	   The Palestinian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the M-16 was handed over by Palestinian university students
not involved in the attack on the soldier.
	   One of the students was held for questioning, however, and later
the student who had seized the M-16 was arrested.
	   The army spokesman's office said the Palestinian Authority had
pledged to take steps against those involved in the attack.
	   A preliminary Israeli army investigation into the incident has
found that the soldier under attack, Cpl. Assaf Meyara, 19, should
have fired on his assailants, the Yediot Ahronot daily said.
	   Meyara will likely be charged in military court with violating
army procedures, the newspaper said.
	   However, the army spokesman's office said that although Meyera
did violate army procedure by carrying a weapon that was unloaded,
the investigation was still ongoing as to whether he should have
loaded it and opened fire.
	   Meyera's mother Lisa said she was taken aback by the public
onslaught of criticism complaining that her son did not use his
gun.
	   ``It basically makes me feel that they prefer having him open
fire and end up dead - a dead hero,'' Meyera said in an interview
with APTN.
	   Israel and the Palestinians have blamed each other for the
violence, which came days before U.S. President Bill Clinton was to
arrive in the region to usher in the second stage of the Wye River
land-for-security agreement.

Perec prepares comeback after year out of action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS 8th graf saying Perec wants to win gold in Seville,
Sydney.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Three-time Olympic champion Marie-Jose Perec is
ready to resume training after serious injury and illness, the
track star said in a newspaper interview published Friday.
	   The French sprinter has had terrible luck since the 1997 World
Championships in Athens, where she injured a hamstring while
preparing for the 200-meter semifinal race.
	   Perec hoped to make a comeback this season, but has not appeared
since contracting mononucleosis in July.
	   But recent medical tests proved encouraging, and Perec told the
sports daily L'Equipe that she will soon travel to Los Angeles to
resume training with her coach John Smith.
	   ``I will join him soon, though the date is not fixed,'' Perec
was quoted as saying. ``Everything is in order.''
	   Perec said that she is not interested in competing in indoor
events this season, but that she remains confident of a return to
the top level.
	   ``I have total confidence in my body,'' she said. ``I don't
really think that I have had two wasted years. I have not trained
for six months, that's all.''
	   Now, her aim is to win gold at next year's World Championships
in Seville and the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.
	   Perec said she was exhausted after the Atlanta Olympics, where
she won gold at the 200 and 400 meters events.
	   ``I attempted to win a double at the Olympics and few people can
image what that represents,'' she said. ``But my illness in 1998
had nothing to do with that.''

Price hangs on to lead at Million Dollar Challenge

<TEXT>
	   SUN CITY, South Africa (AP) _ Nick Price held on to the lead
with a 4-under par 68 to add to his first round 67 at the Million
Dollar Challenge Friday.
	   Breathing down his neck a shot back was fellow 41-year-old Mark
O'Meara, the American two-time major winner, who shot a 67 for a
two-round total of 136. English star Lee Westwood and Justin
Leonard of the United States were both 7-under par at the end of
the second round.
	   Price played conservative par golf over the first seven holes
but then dropped a shot on the par-4 eighth, where he over cut his
5-iron second shot. He erred on a downhill chip and had to sink a
tough 15-footer for bogey.
	   But the Zimbabwean, defending champion and 1993 winner with a
record 24-under par on the 7,597-yard (6,947-meter) Gary Player
Country Club course, roared back with four straight birdies around
the turn.
	   He gained another stroke on the 15th, where he hit a 9-iron to 9
feet and made the put.
	   O'Meara also bounced back from a front-nine bogey, which he
suffered on the par-4 third. Last year's PGA player of the year
found the sand with his approach and then three-putted.
	   O'Meara birdied on holes 5, 6, 8 and 9 to reach the turn at 33.
A third straight birdie on the 10th was cancelled out when he made
a 1 over 5 on the 13th. He answered back with a birdie 4 on the
14th and added another stroke on the last hole.
	   The round of the day belonged to Westwood, who was level par
Thursday, with an 8-birdie 65, marred only by a 1 over 5 at the
opening hole.
	   The dlrs 2.57 million tournament features 12 of the world's best
players.

Europe's economic union underway with rate cut, Germany pleased
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The decision by the 11 nations adopting the
new euro currency effectively launches the monetary union one month
ahead of schedule, while boosting confidence in the historic
project.
	   Even Germany's finance minister, who had been demanding such
cuts for months, appeared pleased Friday with the lower interest
rates, nearly unified at 3 percent, which should give boost to
slowing growth.
	   ``This is the right path, and I think now that we have a chance
to avoid a too-sharp drop in growth,'' Finance Minister Oskar
Lafontaine said in Washington, where he was to meet with top
treasury and banking officials.
	   The cuts Wednesday nearly completed the goal of unifying
interest rates among the nations adopting the euro _ a key
condition to introducing the joint currency on Jan. 1. Only Italy
did not reach the 3.0 percent common rate of the other 10 nations,
stuck at 3.5 percent but expected to drop by the launch date.
	   Italy's central bank governor, Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, described
the coordinated nature of Wednesday's cuts as the real start of
monetary union.
	   ``The importance of this move cannot be overstated,''
Padoa-Schioppa said during a speech late Wednesday.
	   With political pressure mounting from the Germans and French who
wanted an economic boost to fight unemployment, analysts had feared
the policy-making ECB would not cut rates just to prove its
independence.
	   ECB President Wim Duisenberg admitted in an interview Friday
that had been a factor.
	   ``The political pressure that arose in the meantime only made it
rather more difficult to actually do something,'' Duisenberg was
quoted as saying by the Financial Times.
	   ``And we had long discussions about that, because it does create
a certain stubbornness in the minds of central bankers. We have
consciously decided to demonstrate our independence,'' Duisenberg
said.
	   Concern about declining growth finally persuaded them, said the
head of Germany's powerful Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer.
	   Another Bundesbanker, Reimut Jochimsen, said the cuts were a
``well considered, wise move at the right time.''
	   The decision allays all uncertainty about the starting interest
rate level on Jan. 1 and paves the way for a ``steady hand policy''
by the ECB, Jochimsen said.
	   Reaction has been mostly favorable, though few believe the cuts
will stop declining growth, as Europe feels the pinch from Asian
and Russian economic crises and recent turbulence on international
financial markets.
	   ``Sentiment toward Europe is likely to become more positive,''
said Kazuo Takayama, chief foreign exchange manager at Midland Bank
in Tokyo.
	   The 11 countries launching the euro are Austria, Belgium,
Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Spain and Portugal.

Ukraine's parliament gives initial approval to election bill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament on Friday gave
preliminary approval to a bill on presidential elections.
	   The bill allows political parties to nominate candidates, or
individuals to nominate themselves, but bars anyone else _ such as
industrial groups or lobbying organizations, who have been active
in previous campaigns _ from putting forth a candidate.
	   Ukraine's next presidential elections are scheduled for next
October.
	   Deputies in the 450-seat legislature voted 249-15 to approve the
first reading of the law.
	   The document requires a turnout of more than 50 percent of
eligible voters to validate the results. A candidate needs to be
supported by more than a half of the voters who cast their ballots
to become a winner in the first round.
	   A simple majority of voters and no voter turnout margin are
required for the second round, between the two best performers from
the first round.
	   Every nominated candidate must collect 1 million signatures _
among Ukraine's 35 million eligible voters _ to be on the ballot.
	   The bill approved Friday is to pass two more readings before
final approval.
	   President Leonid Kuchma, in office since 1994, has said he would
seek second presidential term.
	   He faces a growing army of contenders, which already includes
influential former parliament speaker Oleksandr Moroz and former
Prime Minister Yevhen Marchuk. As many as a dozen candidates are
expected to take part.
	   However, analysts expect no quick approval for the presidential
elections law. They have predicted divisions among supporters of
Kuchma and those of other candidates over the law's key provisions,
depending on whether they're seen to favor the incumbent or his
challengers.

Bosnia gets a rump House of Representatives
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The Bosnian joint House of
Representatives, supposed to be comprised of five delegates for
each of the country's three ethnic groups, was inaugurated on
Friday in Sarajevo minus one Croat member.
	   The chief international overseer, Carlos Westendorp, had ruled
that the composition of the five delegates from each group --
Muslim, Serb and Croat -- must reflect the outcome of the September
election.
	   That meant four of the Bosnian Croat delegates should come from
the ruling Bosnian Croat Democratic Union, or HDZ, and the fifth
from the opposition, the New Croat Initiative.
	   The Croats first selected all five members from the HDZ and
after Westendorp's warning, revised their decision. But they again
avoided the New Croat Initiative and instead appointed the fifth
from another Croat hard-line party.
	   Westendorp declared the decision void and urged them to select
again. On Friday, the Bosnian Croats failed to agree again and the
inauguration of the body proceeded without the fifth Croat member,
who will be selected later.

Taiwan's ruling party hopes to snuff opposition in mayor's race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with campaigns winding down, quote from president &QL; 
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The politicians who run Taiwan hope to
rebuild support and wipe away hints of corruption Saturday with a
candidate who calls himself squeaky clean _ though he freely admits
spending too much money on the campaign.
	   Ma Ying-jeou promises a full, honest accounting of his excesses
after voters make their choice in the Taipei mayoral race. The
contest is the focal point of elections seen as a barometer for the
bigger call Taiwanese must make 16 months later when they pick a
successor to President Lee Teng-hui.
	   ``The spending has become a joke,'' Ma said, adding that Taiwan
``cannot wait to form a democratic institution with substance _ we
need to clean up.''
	   The races are nasty on the surface _ plenty of ethnic
disparagement and allegations of whoremongering _ but the broader
issue of Taiwan's delicate status vis-a-vis mainland China lingers
more quietly.
	   Taipei voters may back Ma, the Nationalist Party candidate, if
they're spooked by the idea that re-electing the opposition mayor,
Chen Shui-bian, could someday push Taiwan toward a deadly
confrontation with China. Taiwan and China were separated by civil
war in 1949; Beijing considers Taiwan a renegade province.
	   The platform of Chen's Democratic Progressive Party calls for
Taiwan to formally state its independence. In their hearts, many
Taiwanese favor the idea, but they can't forget the tense standoff
three years ago, when China demonstrated its views on Taiwanese
sovereignty by test-firing missiles off the coast.
	   If Chen hangs on to power, the DPP keeps the biggest plum it has
picked since martial law ended in 1987 _ which could help the
opposition's hopes of electing its first president in 2000.
	   If Ma and the Nationalists can reclaim Taipei, they could halt
the advance of the DPP and possibly restore a popularity that
crumbled amid perceptions of dirty dealing and embarrassing losses
in last year's local elections.
	   The Taipei mayoral race is too close to call, with a long shot
candidate from the tiny New Party _ Wang Chien-shien _ expected to
take more votes away from Ma than from Chen.
	   The governing Nationalist Party is likely to retain control of
the Legislature, which is being expanded to 225 seats. Voters also
will choose a Taipei city council and a mayor and council in the
big southern city, Kaohsiung.
	   Democracy, merely a decade-old phenomenon in Taiwan, has turned
into a raucous show. The campaigners were out early Friday,
parading in wildly decked out trucks and jeeps, pounding drums in a
tribal rhythm and blaring messages through megaphones.
	   Candidates were wrapping things up at boisterous rallies.
	   The president took the stage to lend his considerable support to
Ma.
	   ``I'm the best helmsman, taking you to the good life, but this
ship must continue its course,'' Lee said.
	   It's hard to distinguish Taipei's mayoral candidates by
listening to their speeches about making the capital a world-class
city and fixing routine urban problems.
	   The island's big issue _ China relations _ has been neutralized
to the point that no politician who favors reunification dares say
so, just as those who prefer a bold claim of independence keep
quiet for fear of provoking a military attack from Beijing.
	   It would be hard to find a Taiwanese willing to trade the
island's prosperity for a life under Chinese communism, but a
declaration of independence is viewed as too risky.
	   Chen refuses to tout his party's call for independence and has
reverted instead to questioning the loyalty of Ma _ who was born to
mainland parents but moved to Taiwan at age 1.
	   Such talk stirs ethnic emotions that previously had Taiwanese
voters fighting with their fists.
	   But violence is down from previous elections and arrests for
vote buying purportedly have been confined to rural areas where
people were offered cooking oil and a few dollars for their
support.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union nations on Friday
pledged to step up the fight against child pornography on the

One killed, six wounded, border incident reported in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A woman was killed and six people
wounded in a shootout in Kosovo's second-largest city Friday, and
the Serb-led Yugoslav army reported another border incident, amid
growing violence in the troubled province.
	   The Serb-run Media Center said the shooting in the western town
of Pec occurred when a woman and man attacked a Serb policeman
guarding Pec's hospital. The two reportedly shot at the policeman,
then took his automatic rifle and fired, wounding several people
standing around the policeman.
	   The media center said that the female attacker was killed by
other guards while her partner managed to escape. They reportedly
threw a hand grenade inside the hospital, but it did not explode.
Six people, including the policeman and a boy, were wounded in the
shootout, which could not be independently confirmed.
	   In another reported incident, Yugoslav border guards shot at a
group of ten ethnic Albanians who tried to cross illegally into
Yugoslavia from Albania and allegedly fired at the guards first.
The army reported no injuries, but said its troops found some
weapons left behind by the attackers, the Serb Media Center said.
	   Yugoslavia has reported several such incidents in the past week,
but they could not be independently confirmed. On Friday, the
government lodged a protest with the Albanian ambassador in
Yugoslavia over the incidents. It accused Albania of deliberately
raising tensions in Kosovo with an aim to undermine a political
process, the Tanjug news agency reported.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A fire chief was suspended Friday, a
day after a blaze at an orphanage in his district killed 25
children and five adults, raising serious questions about how
quickly firefighters had responded.
	   No reason was given for why Paco fire chief Romeo Almero was
taken off duty by Manila fire chief Roel Chua, and it was unclear
what charges or possible penalties he would face.
	   Philippine media reports Friday said firemen had arrived late at
the scene of the predawn fire Thursday at the orphanage, built 85
years ago and run by a women's organization in the Manila slum of
Paco.
	   Almero protested his ouster. ``This is unfair. I was not given
the chance to explain,'' he said, without elaborating.
	   Fire officers have said they arrived at the scene within three
minutes of the first call.
	   But they also said the call came more than an hour after the
first witnesses saw the fire. About 70 percent of the orphanage was
already burning when they arrived.
	   Manila fire operations chief Pablito Cordeta said there were no
telephones in the immediate vicinity, and orphanage staffers
couldn't get to the room with a telephone because it was engulfed
in flames.
	   Investigators said Friday they have yet to determine the cause
of the fire. Earlier, they said they suspected faulty electrical
wiring.
	   Cordeta said the fire started in the library on the second floor
of the mostly wooden building.
	   ``We have stopped looking for casualties. I believe we have
already gone through what was left of the orphanage several times
and we have not found any more human remains,'' Cordeta said.
	   Faulty equipment or lax enforcement of fire regulations are
responsible for many deadly fires in the Philippines _ including a
fire in May at a hospital in Quezon City that killed 25 people and
another fire two years ago at a disco in the same suburb that
killed 162 people.
	   Evelyn Lontok, a social worker, said staffers told authorities
that 49 children and 19 adults were in the orphanage when the fire
broke out.
	   Some children shouted for help from the second-floor windows,
which were covered with metal grills to protect against intruders.
Neighbors were unable to open the padlocked main gate to get to
them.
	   Pope John Paul II said he was deeply saddened and promised to
pray for the victims. Jaime Cardinal Sin, the archbishop of Manila,
also called for prayers.
	   Several babies were among those who died. The orphanage also
took care of children of unwed mothers and children of working
parents.
	   Family of the victims said they were considering a mass burial
for those who could not be identified because of severe burns.
	   Ederlina Mobrerossaid said her 5-year-old daughter Maybeline
died in the fire because she was abandoned along with two other
children who could not be roused from their sleep by an orphanage
worker.
	   ``Why was my daughter abandoned? They could have tossed her out
through the fire exit,'' Mobrerossaid said, tears welling in her
eyes. ``She could have been hurt but she would still be alive.''
	   Juan Agravante, a real estate salesman, was also killed in the
fire. He had been visiting his wife, Maria Theresa, a baby-sitter
at the orphanage.
	   Their bodies were found in each other's arms, hugging their two
sons, John Andrian, 8, and Jomari, 2.

Death toll from Armenian sanitarium explosion rises to 11
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ The death toll from an explosion at a
children's wing of an Armenian resort rose to 11 on Friday, as
rescuers found seven more bodies, including three children.
	   Investigators believe the explosion may have been cause by a gas
leak.
	   Twelve people, two of them children, were wounded in the blast
Thursday in a cafeteria at the resort, the State Emergency
Department said. Four adult victims were found Thursday and
rescuers continued to search through rubble Friday.
	   The children's sanitarium in Dzhermuk _ a well-known mineral
water resort 150 kilometers (90 miles) southeast of Armenia's
capital, Yerevan _ housed children accompanied by their mothers.
	   Forty-two people were in the building at the time of the blast,
though it was unclear how many were in the cafeteria.
	   Armenia's President Robert Kocharian and Prime Minister Armen
Darbinian have sent condolences to the victims' families.

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Long-serving players Steve Bruce and
Brian McClair left Manchester United within the last two years. Now
they're among the favorites to return to Old Trafford to replace
Brian Kidd as assistant to manager Alex Ferguson.
	   Dismaying Ferguson, the United players and fans, Kidd left
United on Thursday to become manager of last place Blackburn, his
first job as a No. 1.
	   His move comes with United facing up to a match against Aston
Villa Saturday, with the opportunity of replacing Villa at the top
of the standings. Next Wednesday, United faces Bayern Munich with a
quarterfinal place at stake in the Champions Cup.
	   ``That's why it's difficult to take because we are in the middle
of a really important programme for the club,'' Ferguson said of
Kidd's departure.
	   ``I would have preferred it to be in the summer to be honest
with you. I worked hard to keep him here in the summer and we are
all disappointed that he has left.'' 
	   United won't rush into naming a replacement but will have
several candidates in mind, including Bruce and McClair.
	   A long-serving center-back and team captain who helped United
win three Premier League titles in four years and two FA Cups,
37-year-old Bruce is now manager of division one Sheffield United.
He left Old Trafford for a two-year spell as a player with
Birmingham City.
	   At Sheffield, Bruce has fought a running battle with the owners
to gain money to buy players yet has kept the club within range of
promotion to the top flight.
	   McClair, 34, left Old Trafford after 11 years service as a
player. Although he has no managerial experience, he has
qualifications as a coach and has a long-standing relationship with
Ferguson. He left Manchester United in the summer to join one of
his former clubs, Motherwell, as a player.
	   Mark McGhee, 41, who was fired by division one Wolves a month
ago after a series of poor results, is a good friend of Ferguson
and played under him at Aberdeen in the early 1980s.
	   Ferguson may choose to elevate reserve team coach Jimmy Ryan,
although he probably would prefer someone younger than 52.
	   Alex McLeish and Alex Miller, who formed a formidable defensive
partnership under Ferguson at Aberdeen and helped the club win the
Cup Winners Cup in 1983, may be contenders after modest successes
as managers in Scotland. What goes against them is a lack of direct
contact with the English game.
	   Former Manchester United center-back Stewart Houston gained
standout results as assistant and then stand-in manager of Arsenal
after George Graham was fired in 1995.
	   Ferguson said that Ryan would be with him at Villa Park on
Saturday.
	   ``I will take Jim Ryan with me tomorrow,'' he said. ``Jim's a
very experienced man and he knows the club.
	   ``As far as the replacement is concerned, there won't be
anything immediate and there won't be anything done in a hurry.
	   ``We will sit down and have a good think about it because it's
obviously an important role, particularly with the size of the job
nowadays,'' Ferguson said.
	   ``I have to give it a great deal of consideration and to make
sure I bring in the right type of person to this particular club.''

FIFA considers out-of-competition testing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Soccer-FIFA-World Cup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Admitting a growing doping problem in
soccer, FIFA on Friday agreed in principle to introduce random
out-of-competition drug tests for players.
	   But the world governing body's executive committee continued to
defy attempts by the International Olympic Committee to harmonize
doping sanctions.
	   Michel D'Hooghe, chairman of FIFA's committee for sports
medicine, expressed his ``serious concern about a growing trend for
doping in football'' at Friday's FIFA meeting.
	   Italian soccer, in particular, has been rocked by doping
controversies this year. Magistrates launched an investigation into
alleged widespread doping in Serie A after allegations by Roma
coach Zdnek Zeman.
	   The FIFA committee backed D'Hooge's call for random
out-of-competition testing but didn't decide on when and how the
controls would take place.
	   ``It's going to have to be done together with the national
associations,'' FIFA president Sepp Blatter said.
	   Surprise, out-of-competition controls are considered the most
effective way of catching drug cheats.
	   FIFA again expressed reservations about the IOC's proposal for
minimum two-year suspensions for athletes found guilty of using
steroids or other serious drugs, with a life ban for a second
offense.
	   FIFA instead called for ``flexibility regarding sanctions for
doping offenders.''
	   FIFA was one of three federations _ the others were those
representing tennis and cycling _ which dissented on the
anti-doping resolutions adopted last Friday at a meeting of the IOC
and 35 Olympic sports bodies.
	   FIFA objected to the two-year sanction on grounds that the
penalty might not stand up in court and because certain prohibited
drugs have no performance-enhancing benefits in sports like soccer.
	   FIFA said Friday that a panel of experts should be appointed to
``keep up to date with rapid developments in the pharmaceutical
industry.''
	   FIFA's list of banned substances would need to be updated
monthly to keep up with those developments, Blatter said.
	   Blatter said he will raise FIFA's reservations at a Jan. 6
meeting in Zurich with IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch.
	   Samaranch last week said he was confident the dissenting
federations would sign up to the agreement before the world
anti-doping summit in Lausanne in February.

<TEXT>
	   SUN CITY, South Africa (AP) _ Defending champ Nick Price
continued his dominance of this Gary Player Country Club course,
shooting a 4-under par 68 Friday and adding to his first round 67
at the Million Dollar Challenge.
	   Breathing down his neck a shot back was fellow 41-year-old Mark
O'Meara, the American two-time major winner, who scored a 67 for a
two-round total of 136.
	   The younger generation was just behind. English star Lee
Westwood, 25, and Justin Leonard, 26, of the United States were
both at 137 for 7-under par after two rounds.
	   Price played conservative par golf over the first seven holes
but then dropped a shot on the par-4 eighth, where he over cut his
5-iron second shot. He erred on a downhill chip and had to sink a
tough 15-footer for bogey.
	   But the Zimbabwean, also 1993 winner with a record 24-under par
on the 7,597-yard (6,947-meter) Gary Player Country Club course,
roared back with four straight birdies around the turn.
	   He gained another stroke on the 15th, where he hit a 9-iron to 9
feet and made the put.
	   ``I was not particularly concerned about being in the lead,''
Price said. ``I just wanted to be one or two back,'' at least, he
said.
	   Price is clearly at ease here. He knows the course well, is
playing in front of family and does best in the heat. The sun was
hot Friday in the South African summer after cool, rainy weather
earlier in the week, improving the course and accounting for better
scores all around.
	   ``I'm not going out there and worrying too much about what the
others are doing,'' he said of the elite 12-man field, which
includes Tiger Woods, David Duval and Ernie Els in the dlrs 2.57
million tournament. Els was 5 under par, Woods 4 and Duval 1 over
at 145 after two days.
	   O'Meara also bounced back from a front-nine bogey, which he
suffered on the par-4 third. Last year's PGA player of the year
found the sand with his approach and then three-putted.
	   O'Meara birdied on holes 5, 6, 8 and 9 to reach the turn at 33.
A third straight birdie on the 10th was cancelled out when he made
a 1 over 5 on the 13th. He answered back with a birdie 4 on the
14th and added another stroke on the last hole.
	   The round of the day belonged to Westwood _ who was level par
Thursday _ with an 8-birdie 65, marred only by a 1 over 5 at the
opening hole.
	   ``I struggled with my putting yesterday. Now it's in shape,'' he
said. ``I thought it was going to be a long day. Then on the 2nd I
fiddled around with my grip and ... had better luck.'' Westwood
said he raised his hands on the putter.
	   He was paired with Woods, and said the two of them spent the day
laughing and joking.
	   ``I like playing with Tiger, and we both play better when we're
together,'' Westwood said.

Czech officials withdraw charges against Zilk
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; UPDATES with Havel's spokesman confirming meeting with Zilk, Kavan
apology

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Charges that the former mayor of
Vienna spied for the Czechoslovak communist police were publicly
withdrawn Friday, and the Czech foreign minister apologized for the
accusations, the CTK news agency reported.
	   Foreign Minister Jan Kavan presented a formal apology to
Austrian Ambassador Peter Niesner, after Czech Ambassador Jiri
Grusa said in Vienna that the charges were ``irrelevant.'' Grusa
said he based his comments on the findings of a special Interior
Ministry commission set up to examine the spy allegations.
	   Zilk had denied the charges, which surfaced just three days
before he was to have been presented with a Czech Republic medal of
honor Oct. 28. ``I'm glad that what I was saying from the very
beginning turned out to be true,'' he told CTK.
	   Kavan expressed regret over the ``dissemination of unverified
information,'' CTK said.
	   The office of President Vaclav Havel said he would receive Zilk
on Tuesday but said Havel was not planning immediate comments on
the case.
	   The accusations originally came from unidentified sources and
said Zilk spied for the communist secret service and provided
information that led to several convictions. Zilk also signed a
declaration of loyalty to the communist government, the sources
claimed. Originally, Ivan Medek, the head of Havel's office, called
the information ``absolutely reliable.''

Turkish Cypriot leader proposes non-aggression pact
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash on
Friday proposed to Greek Cypriots a non-aggression pact to ensure
peace on this divided Mediterranean island.
	   ``Let's sign a non-aggression agreement between the two states.
So I will feel relieved (and) you will feel relieved,'' Denktash
was quoted as saying by the Turkish Cypriot news agency, TAK.
	   Turkish Cypriots have no intention of attacking the Greek side,
Denktash added.
	   The planned purchase by Greek Cypriots of anti-ircraft missiles
from Russia has increased tension on the island. Greek Cypriots
last week said the missiles would be deployed on Cyprus despite the
opposition of Greece, which fears a war with Turkey.
	   Turkey has threatened to strike the missile batteries if
installed.
	   Cyprus has been divided in Greek and Turkish sections since
1974, when Turkish troops invaded the northern third of the island
following a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Denktash set up the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus,
recognized only by Turkey, in 1983.
	   Cyprus and Greece have rejected Denktash' proposal for a
confederation of two states, claiming it would finalize the
division of the island.
	   UN-sponsored reunification talks stalled last year.

Researchers find genetic variation speeds AIDS progression
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Genes that in most people slow the progression
of an AIDS virus infection have some variations that actually
accelerate the disease, U.S. researchers reported Friday.
	   In a study published in the journal Science, National Institutes
of Health researchers report that a gene variation called CCR5P1
allows HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, to spread rapidly.
	   Researchers earlier found four separate genes, called CCR5, SDF,
CCR5P and CCR2, that act to slow the progression of HIV by
preventing the virus from invading cells.
	   Further studies, however, found that each of these genes has
variations that actually accelerate the disease. Dr. Stephen J.
O'Brien of the National Cancer Institute, co-author of the study,
said one of these accelerator variations has now been identified.
	   O'Brien said about 10 percent to 15 percent of all HIV patients
progress rapidly to AIDS, an advanced stage of HIV infection. Of
these rapid progressors, he said, 10 percent to 17 percent have two
copies of the CCR5P1 gene variation.
	   Researchers hope to identify all the other gene variations
involved in both the rapid acceleration of HIV and in the slow
progress of the disease. This will help in the design and testing
of vaccines that would protect against infection by HIV, said
O'Brien.
	   ``We would like to develop vaccines that imitate what the
protect genes do,'' said O'Brien. But to accomplish this, he said,
the researchers also need to identify the gene variations that
actually speed up the disease.

German announced China visit even as Foreign Minister meets

dissident &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Schroeder announcing spring visit in lede &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said
Friday he expects to visit China in the spring, even as his Foreign
Minister met with China's most famous dissident in a move certain
to anger the Beijing government.
	   Calling ties to China extremely important, Schroeder said the
visit could take place in May.
	   Schroeder said he hoped to deepen ties and noted that China was
playing an important role in stabilizing Asia's struggling
economies by not devaluing its currency.
	   Meanwhile Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer met with dissident
Wei Jingsheng and discussed human rights in China, officials said.
	   The move will anger Beijing, which routinely objects when
dissidents are given an audience with a foreign government. China
says Wei, whom it exiled last year, is a criminal.
	   Wei's talk with Joschka Fischer in Bonn on Thursday reflected
what the 6-week-old center-left government says is a new emphasis
on human rights in German foreign policy.
	   ``Of course we see the topic's sensitivity, but there can be no
ban on talks,'' government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said.
	   Chinese-German ties have been strained by last month's expulsion
of a German magazine reporter from China for allegedly stealing
state secrets.
	   The reporter, Juergen Kremb, speculated that Chinese officials
wanted to punish him for occasionally critical reporting and for
contacts with dissidents, including Wei, about whom Kremb published
a book last year.
	   ``Fischer was interested in Wei's view and asked him for his
assessment of the current situation in China,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Martin Erdmann said. He refused to give details of the
talks.
	   Wei was in Germany to attend a ceremony marking the 50th
anniversary of the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A longstanding political dispute over how
to confront Poland's bitter past rekindled Friday when President
Aleksander Kwasniewski vetoed a bill that would open secret police
files to victims of communist-era repression.
	   The issue pits former communists like Kwasniewski against the
anti-communist Solidarity movement that now heads a governing
coalition, extending their decades-old conflict that shaped Polish
history and toppled communist rule nine years ago.
	   Passed by parliament on Sept. 22, the bill would create an
Institute of National Remembrance to collect communist files from
1944-89, as well as documents of Stalinist and Nazi crimes. The
institute would make the files available to victims and reveal who
informed on them.
	   It also would empower the institute to launch investigations to
establish those responsible for persecution or political murders.
	   Kwasniewski argued the law would give too much power to the
institute managing the files. He also said all Poles, not only
victims of totalitarian regimes, should be allowed to see their
records.
	   The veto sends the law back to parliament, which could override
it with a 60 percent majority in the powerful Sejm chamber. But the
governing coalition headed by Solidarity lacks enough seats to
guarantee an override, and officials said Friday they would prepare
a new bill.
	   ``This decision shows that the president wants to block the
truth about our history of the time when millions of our
compatriots were being persecuted,'' said Solidarity chairman
Marian Krzaklewski.
	   Others charged that Kwasniewski, leader of a reformed communists
party until forced to relinquish the post after his 1995 election
victory over Solidarity founder Lech Walesa, was reluctant to go
against the wishes of his leftist colleagues.
	   But Kwasniewski's lawyer said the president might prepare his
own draft of the law.
	   In October, Kwasniewski signed another law that requires
government officials, judges and others to declare if they ever
worked for or collaborated with the former security service. Under
the law, which took effect last week, those making false
declarations can lose their job.
	   The question of confronting more than four decades of
totalitarian rule puts pressure on Poland's political fault line,
with Solidarity continuing to criticize decades of communism and
leftists with roots in the totalitarian rule unable to openly
accept blame for past policies.
	   Solidarity leaders, who push for disclosing the truth, say
secret files should be open to ensure historical justice and make
sure criminals of the past no longer hold power, even if that
forces out top political leaders.
	   They also warn that former agents hiding their past could be
controlled or blackmailed by criminal gangs or foreign governments.
	   Former communists, who now form the largest opposition bloc, say
the files are incomplete and unreliable, a result of uncontrolled
work by the dreaded Security Service of the communist era.
	   Some also argue opening the files could cause political turmoil,
like the first attempt to deal with the matter. In 1992, the
rightist government of Jan Olszewski was toppled on a no-confidence
vote after releasing an unconfirmed list of alleged communist
agents.
	   ``There will be a lot of harm,'' said Jozef Oleksy, an
ex-communist who was forced to resign as prime minister in 1996 due
to allegations that he was a Moscow informer.
	   A military prosecutor eventually cleared Oleksy of any
wrongdoing.
	   ``The accusation is printed in big letters on front pages while
... the apology either never gets printed or it is published in a
very narrow circulation,'' he said.
	   Walesa, however, called Kwasniewski's decision ``a mistake'' and
said secret files should be opened as soon as possible to clear the
political scene.
	   ``There will be victims, but you cannot settle this problem
without victims,'' he said. Enduring the controversy now, he
argued, would end all speculation and ``mud-slinging.''

FIFA keeps door open on Confederations Cup dates

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ FIFA President Sepp Blatter said
Friday the world body aims to kick off the controversial
Confederations Cup on July 28 next year, but could still move the
date to accommodate France.
	   FIFA last month moved the eight-nation event, to be held in
Mexico, from Jan. 8-20 to July 28-Aug. 8 to placate France, which
withdrew because of conflicts with the European club calendar.
	   However, French soccer officials still haven't decided whether
to play in the cup.
	   French Football Federation president Claude Simonet accepted the
changes. But the summer dates upset Noel Le Graet, president of the
French National League, which plans to begin its 1999-2000
championship on July 28.
	   ``We may be able to bring it forward slightly,'' Blatter said
after a meeting of FIFA's executive committee.
	   But the change could be only a matter of a few days, to prevent
the cup clashing with the end of the South American soccer season,
he added.
	   ``We'll leave it open for the time being,'' he said, without
indicating when a decision will be made. However, he ``anticipated
that France will take part with a first-choice team.''
	   Mexico, Bolivia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, New Zealand and
the United States are also entered in the competition.
	   Also Friday, FIFA provisionally set aside a nine-day period in
January 2000 for the first edition of a new eight-team World Club
Championship.
	   The tournament will have to be coordinated with other
competitions, Blatter stressed.
	   In other business, FIFA said a proposal to adapt the FIFA
president's term of office to avoid presidential elections
coinciding with World Cup finals will be discussed at its congress
in Los Angeles next July.
	   The president is currently elected for a four-year term.
	   Blatter defeated UEFA President Lennart Johansson for the post
in June, just before the start of this year's World Cup, after a
bitter election campaign.
	   The creation of an arbitration tribunal for soccer-related
disputes will also be on the agenda, FIFA said.

Army says it killed 250 rebels in northern Rwanda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ The Rwandan army has killed more than 250
Hutu rebels during recent fighting in the northwest of the country,
the Rwanda News Agency reported Friday.
	   Citing military sources, the agency said at least two rebel
battalions, made up of as many as 1,200 men, had been cornered near
the Gishwati Forest where fighting took place between Nov. 16 and
27.
	   The rebels are former Hutu soldiers and militiamen responsible
for the 1994 genocide of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and
politically moderate Hutus. The killing ended when Tutsi-led rebels
won power in July 1994, sending thousands of defeated soldiers to
the neighboring former Zaire.
	   Many still have bases in what is now called Congo, from where
they have been launching cross-border attacks.
	   Since August, more than 650,000 people, mostly Hutus, have fled
their homes in northwestern Rwanda to seek protection from the army
in 19 makeshift camps. Rebel extortion, harassment and killings of
both Tutsis and Hutus who refuse them food, money or shelter have
increasingly turned the population against the insurgents.
	   Among the more than 250 rebels killed in the recent fighting was
Capt. Joseph Nzabonimpa, former commander of traffic police before
the 1994 genocide, the news agency said.

Latest call from bishops for married priests comes from afar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ From far-flung islands and vast, distant
lands come the latest cries from clergy who are too few to properly
tend their flock: Give us married priests.
	   Bishops from Oceania, which includes Australia and New Zealand
and even more remote places like Papua New Guinea and the Solomon
Islands, are desperate for more priests for spiritually hungry
Roman Catholics.
	   Their pleas to Pope John Paul II to rethink his insistence on
celibate clergy are resounding these days during a special meeting
at the Vatican of bishops and other top clergy from the region.
	   One bishop, Ambrose Kiapseni, of Kavieng, Papua New Guinea, said
he and his colleagues at the synod wanted the pope to hear their
concern about the ``gradual spiritual starvation of our Catholic
people and their moving away from us to find spiritual nourishment
elsewhere.''
	   Some participants blamed the distress on the lack of priests.
	   Said the leader of a missionary order in Australia, the Rev.
Patrick Moroney: ``It would be a great grace if ... another look
could be taken at the situation of ordaining committed married men
to the priesthood and also the possibility of a more compassionate
assessment of the situation of priests who have left due to their
inability to live the celibate life.''
	   The bishop of Cairns, Australia, James Foley, reported that his
discussion group raised the possibility of a special dispensation
from the celibacy rule in some parts of Oceania and noted that the
faithful might ``readily adjust to this'' given the Vatican's
acceptance of married clergy who convert to Catholicism from other
faiths, such as Anglicanism.
	   But while all agree that serving Catholics in dioceses in which
churches are separated by stretches of inpenetrable jungle or
lonely canoe rides is an overriding problem, not all thought that
allowing married priests would solve it.
	   Having married priests would create more problems than not
having them, some argued. For instance, custom would dictate that
poor local churches would have to support numerous family members
for years after a priest's death, said Wewak Bishop Raymond Philip
Kalisz, head of the bishops conference of Papua New Guinea and the
Solomon Islands.
	   Earlier this decade, the Vatican proposed sending more European
and North American priests to fill gaps in Latin American and
elsewhere.
	   Previous synods, bringing bishops from the world's other
regions, have heard calls for married priests, but the refrain
seemed the loudest at this one.
	   In a 1990 gathering here of bishops worldwide, there was a
smattering of appeals, but the assembly itself concluded by
affirming the ban on married clergy.
	   It is unlikely that the pope, who has said he intends to make
the ban stick, will change his mind. The church contends that sex
and family obligations can distract a priest from his spiritual
duties.
	   Two married men who were allowed to be ordained in priest-short
Brazil had to pledge to abstain from sex. But in a 1991 visit to
that populous, vast country, the pope made clear such rare
exceptions was not the way to solve the priest shortage.

Ethiopia starts polio vaccinations

	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ The government began a polio
immunization campaign Friday, saying it hopes to give the vaccine
to 8 million children under 5 years old.
	   About 90,000 health workers and volunteers will give the
vaccinations at 30,000 sites throughout the country.
	   In a similar polio immunization campaign a month ago, about 9
million children were to be vaccinated, but the Ministry of Health
has yet to say how many actually received the vaccines.

Thousands turn out for Miss World's homecoming
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NETANYA, Israel (AP) _ A jubilant crowd of thousands turned out
in the coastal town of Netanya on Friday to welcome home the newly
crowned Miss World, Linor Abargil.
	   An 18-year-old of Libyan and Moroccan extraction, Abargil won
her title last week at the Miss World contest in the Seychelles
Islands.
	   Her townsfolk _ from tots to grandparents _ waited in the main
square for the return of the brown-eyed high school graduate.
	   Wearing a crown, Abargil arrived in a black limousine followed
by a stream of motorcycles. Dozens broke through police lines for a
better view.
	   In a ceremony attended by Netanya's mayor, Abargil waved to the
cheering crowd and thanked her family and the town.
	   Abargil is due to begin 20 months of compulsory military service
in April 1999, but her family hopes the army will postpone her
induction to enable her to fulfill the year-long duties of Miss
World.

Europe's economic union underway with rate cut, Germany pleased
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Tietmeyer warns growth in industrialized
countries threatened, grafs 11-12 &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The decision by the 11 nations adopting the
new euro currency effectively launches the monetary union one month
ahead of schedule, while boosting confidence in the historic
project.
	   Even Germany's finance minister, who had been demanding such
cuts for months, appeared pleased Friday with the lower interest
rates, nearly unified at 3 percent, which should give boost to
slowing growth.
	   ``This is the right path, and I think now that we have a chance
to avoid a too-sharp drop in growth,'' Finance Minister Oskar
Lafontaine said in Washington, where he was to meet with top
treasury and banking officials.
	   The cuts Wednesday nearly completed the goal of unifying
interest rates among the nations adopting the euro _ a key
condition to introducing the joint currency on Jan. 1. Only Italy
did not reach the 3.0 percent common rate of the other 10 nations,
stuck at 3.5 percent but expected to drop by the launch date.
	   Italy's central bank governor, Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, described
the coordinated nature of Wednesday's cuts as the real start of
monetary union.
	   ``The importance of this move cannot be overstated,''
Padoa-Schioppa said during a speech late Wednesday.
	   With political pressure mounting from the Germans and French who
wanted an economic boost to fight unemployment, analysts had feared
the policy-making ECB would not cut rates just to prove its
independence.
	   ECB President Wim Duisenberg admitted in an interview Friday
that had been a factor.
	   ``The political pressure that arose in the meantime only made it
rather more difficult to actually do something,'' Duisenberg was
quoted as saying by the Financial Times.
	   ``And we had long discussions about that, because it does create
a certain stubbornness in the minds of central bankers. We have
consciously decided to demonstrate our independence,'' Duisenberg
said.
	   Concern about declining growth finally persuaded them, with
economic crises in Asia, Russia and Latin America beginning to
bite, said the head of Germany's powerful Bundesbank, Hans
Tietmeyer.
	   ``It is becoming more apparent that the international setting
has created some extraordinary risks and uncertainties, which are
beginning to retard the pace of economic expansion in the
industrialized countries,'' Tietmeyer said Friday in Luxembourg.
	   Another Bundesbanker, Reimut Jochimsen, said the cuts were a
``well considered, wise move at the right time.''
	   The decision allays all uncertainty about the starting interest
rate level on Jan. 1 and paves the way for a ``steady hand policy''
by the ECB, Jochimsen said.
	   Reaction has been mostly favorable, though few believe the cuts
will stop declining growth, as Europe feels the pinch from Asian
and Russian economic crises and recent turbulence on international
financial markets.
	   ``Sentiment toward Europe is likely to become more positive,''
said Kazuo Takayama, chief foreign exchange manager at Midland Bank
in Tokyo.
	   The 11 countries launching the euro are Austria, Belgium,
Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Spain and Portugal.

Kosovo rebels reject political compromise; new shootouts erupt

interim status, new border shootings, quote; trims

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo rebels rejected a key element
of a U.S.-proposed political settlement Friday and new border
shootings added to a rising death toll, putting dangerous new
strains on the province's fragile peace.
	   Escalating violence in Kosovo, including a shootout Friday that
killed a woman in the province's second-largest city, has lent new
urgency to American-led efforts to get Serbs and ethnic Albanians
to agree on a plan for Kosovo's future. Thirteen ethnic Albanians
have been reported killed this week.
	   But the Kosovo Liberation Army dealt diplomacy a setback by
declaring it would not accept any peace deal short of independence
_ dismissing recent signals the rebels were ready to support a U.S.
proposal.
	   The ethnic Albanian guerrillas said in a statement distributed
in Pristina that they won't accept any political solution ``which
would harm the ideals of our people toward independence, or which
would cement, even temporarily, an imposed joint life in an
anti-Albanian, anti-democratic'' system.
	   A KLA political representative signaled last week the rebels
were ready to postpone independence and accept a plan giving ethnic
Albanians greater self-rule. But the KLA said Friday it was
``undeterred'' in its ``just fight until our independent and
democratic state is established.''
	   The rebels said they would publish a detailed response later on
a revised American political plan, which was distributed to the
Serb and ethnic Albanian sides this week. It calls for an interim
political status for Kosovo.
	   A Western diplomat who declined to be named called news of the
KLA's rejection ``discouraging.''
	   Dozens of people have died in sporadic clashes since an Oct.
12-brokered peace agreement brought a halt to over seven months of
combat in the secessionist province, which is populated
overwhelmingly by ethnic Albanians.
	   Ethnic Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova renewed his call
for international military intervention in the wake of the latest
violence.
	   ``NATO ground troop deployment would provide a greater sense of
security,'' he said at a news conference.
	   The flareup in violence this week is ``a sign that we need a
special security force which will protect citizens and stop
violence in Kosovo,'' Rugova said.
	   A reported clash Friday in the western town of Pec raised the
death toll from the last three days alone to 13 _ all ethnic
Albanians.
	   The Serb-run Media Center said six people also were wounded in a
shootout that erupted after a man and woman attacked a Serb
policeman guarding Pec's hospital. The two reportedly shot and
wounded the policeman, then fired his automatic rifle and also
injured five bystanders.
	   The Serb center said the female attacker was killed by other
guards while her partner escaped.
	   In another reported incident, Yugoslav border guards reportedly
shot at 10 ethnic Albanians who tried to cross illegally into
Yugoslavia from Albania and allegedly fired at the guards first.
	   The border shootings, neither of which could be independently
confirmed, came a day after Yugoslav army border guards said they
shot dead eight ethnic Albanians trying to enter Kosovo from
Albania.
	   That was the single worst breach of the informal, two-month-old
cease-fire.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is assembling a force of 2,000 unarmed international verifiers in
Kosovo, declined to single out Serb forces or Kosovo rebels for the
rising violence.
	   ``Both sides are in this conflict are guilty of violating the
cease-fire agreement,'' it said, condemning violence ``from any
quarter.''
	   A KLA commander, however, disputed the army's account of
Thursday's killings, saying they were refugees returning to their
village of Velika Krusa in southwestern Kosovo _ not guerrillas
launching an attack.
	   The commander, who gave his name as Sylemetaj, said six of the
dead were students and most were from a single family clan, the
Hotis.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and up to 300,000 were left
homeless after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a
crackdown last February against rebels who demand independence for
Kosovo.

Germans want to make HES illegal internationally
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The use of blood plasma substitutes
should be banned internationally, the chief of the German Athletics
Federation (DLV) said Friday.
	   Helmut Digel, president of DLV, said he would bring up the
subject at the IAAF Council meeting in April in Seville, Spain.
IAAF is the world governing body of track and field.
	   Digel's proposal came a day after two German tack medalists
admitted taking HES, a plasma substitute and blood thinner that
helps the circulation of blood.
	   The DLV put the substance on its list of banned drugs but
conceded that it did little to prevent athletes from taking it.
	   ``It's only a pledge by 28 DLV doctors that they will not
administer it,'' said Ruediger Nickel, a DLV executive. ``Other
doctors could still inject it.''
	   HES is often suspected of being used to mask blood doping, which
is undetectable by conventional drug testing.
	   Damian Kallabis, the 3,000-meter steeplechase gold medalist in
the European Championships at Budapest in August, and Stephane
Franke, the 10,000 bronze medalist, on Thursday confirmed taking
HES, but denied blood doping.
	   No action is expected immediately against the two runners.
	   But Werner Franke, a leading anti-drug specialist who is not
related to the runner, said the two athletes could be punished
under Germany's laws regulating the abuse of medicine. He said HES
could be a performance-enhancing drug.
	   Meanwhile, a new study confirmed previous estimates that up to
10,000 athletes may have involved in a systematic state-run doping
program in former East Germany.
	   The study, commissioned by the sports committee of the German
parliament and presented by the Cologne-based Federal Institute for
Sports Science, says 6,000-10,000 athletes and 3,000 officials were
involved in the program in the communist state.
	   Between 10 and 15 percent of athletes suffered side affects even
during their career and about 5 percent are still experiencing
serious health problems, such as cancer, heart illness and liver
damage, the study said.

Students overload government computers to protest interest rates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Rather than taking to the streets in
rebellion, thousands of Norwegian students launched a protest by
staying at their desks and inundating government computers with
E-mail this week.
	   The protesters, angry over interest rate hikes on student loans,
sent at least 200,000 messages through the Internet to leading
politicians over the past three days.
	   Protest leader Trygve Ploehn told the Oslo newspaper Dagbladet
that most of the messages were sent to Prime Minister Kjell Magne
Bondevik, who probably didn't notice. Last week, the 51-year-old
prime minister said he didn't know how to use a computer.
	   But the government noticed. It called out the state telephone
company to act as an electronic riot police to set up data
barricades against the E-mail onslaught, Dagbladet said.

Russia criticizes arrest of Serb general accused of war crimes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia on Friday criticized the arrest by NATO-led
troops of a Serb general accused of war crimes, saying the case
should have been handled without NATO interference.
	   Arrests and trials of any suspects accused of war crimes in
Bosnia should be settled ``only via direct cooperation between the
Bosnian sides themselves and the International Tribunal on the
former Yugoslavia,'' the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a
statement quoted by the Interfax and ITAR-Tass news agencies.
	   Gen. Radislav Krstic was seized by U.S. members of the NATO
peacekeeping force on Wednesday. He is the most senior Serb
military officer arrested so far in the effort to bring to trial
Bosnians accused of war crimes.
	   A U.N. indictment said Krstic commanded the soldiers who
executed thousands of Muslims and dumped them in mass graves.
	   Krstic arrived late Thursday in The Hague, where the Yugoslav
war crimes tribunal will try him for genocide, war crimes, crimes
against humanity and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions.
	   ``Russia has never objected to the fair punishment of people who
had committed war crimes in Bosnia and Herzegovina,'' the Russian
Foreign Ministry's statement read.
	   But the ministry urged ``all parties to the international
settlement to act reasonably and cautiously, avoiding steps that
are apt to aggravate the situation and are fraught with unfavorable
consequences for the promotion of the peace process.''
	   The U.N. indictment alleges that troops under Krstic's command
committed offenses after the rebel Serb takeover of the U.N. safe
haven of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia in July 1995.

<TEXT>
	   MAMMOTH MOUNTAIN, California (AP) _ About 30 centimeters (1
foot) of snow fell overnight, causing the race jury to delay the
start of Friday's women's World Cup super-giant slalom by two
hours.
	   Snow ended in the early hours and work crews then went to work
clearing drifts from the top portion of the course, particularly in
a cornice near the peak that tends to collect blown snow.
	   Wind that accompanied the storm abated, although there were
gusts to 32 kph (20 mph) that could also interfere with the race,
the last of the North American swing for the women.
	   Because teams are scheduled to fly back to Europe Saturday, the
race would be canceled if it couldn't be held Friday. It would then
be rescheduled at another site.

Flight forced to turn back after smell in cockpit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ A charter plane with 112 passengers
on board was forced to turn back shortly after take-off Friday
after pilots noticed a smell in the cockpit.
	   The Jumbolino belonging to the British company Flight Line and
chartered by travel company Falcon Travel, had just taken off from
Zurich's Kloten airport heading for London Stansted when the pilots
reported the smell, said Falcon managing director Oskar Laubi.
	   He said the plane landed safely and the passengers were never in
danger.
	   The smell had come from a fault in a circuit of a windshield
heater and the decision had been made to land because if the other
heater had failed as well the pilots' view would have been
obstructed, said Laubi.
	   The fault was repaired and the plane took off again after
several hours' delay, he added.

Rio legislators denounce bribes to favor utility auction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ The turbulent sale of a state
water utility took another setback with the release of taped
conversations showing government leaders apparently trying to bribe
legislators to approve the auction.
	   Rep. Sergio Cabral Filho, president of the Rio state
legislature, said the vote-buying scheme was masterminded by
Finance Secretary Marco Aurelio Alencar, the son of Rio Gov.
Marcello Alencar and a defender of privatization.
	   The tapes, made public Thursday night, purportedly reveal
conversations between legislators and Rep. Aluizio de Castro, who
offered cash for votes. The legislature had barred the sale of Rio
water utility Cedae and was prepared to overturn Gov. Alencar's
veto.
	   ``The chance to make a little money is now, right?'' asks one
legislator, wearing a concealed tape recorder.
	   ``It's now, 70,000 is guaranteed,'' replies Castro. ``I want to
raise it to 80,000. You finish voting, I want everyone to come by
here and pick up a little cake.''
	   The tape doesn't specify if the sum is 70,000 dollars or
Brazilian reals, worth about dlrs 58,000.
	   Alencar called the tapes a ``set-up.'' The legislature voted
overwhelmingly to overturn the veto.
	   Alencar has come under fire for his haste to sell the utility
before he leaves office on Dec. 31. The incoming governor, Anthony
Garotinho, opposes the sale.
	   On Monday, a court order stopped the auction minutes before it
was to start. The injunction found that the state had not met all
the legal requirements for public hearings on the sale.
	   The sale of Cedae already had been postponed several times this
year. Two groups were signed up to bid for the company, with the
minimum price set at 1 billion reals, or dlrs 833 million.

Angolan rebel group says government troops attacking its positions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Angolan air force MiG fighters bombed a
stronghold of the rebel group UNITA for a second day Friday and
were advancing on other rebel-held areas, a UNITA spokesman said.
	   The government denied it was moving on UNITA's central highland
strongholds but said it had recently taken UNITA-held villages.
	   Carlos Morgado, a UNITA spokesman in Lisbon, said MiG jets
bombed Andulo, 480 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of Luanda, for
a second day in the latest clash to threaten the ailing 1994 peace
pact between the two sides.
	   Morgado called on the government to say whether it still
respected the peace accord.
	   ``Does this mean the peace accord is dead? The government must
state openly and clearly whether it has torn up the agreement,'' he
said.
	   Morgado said he had been in telephone contact with Andulo, but
he had no information on casualties. There was no independent
verification of a government attack.
	   In the Angolan capital Luanda, government spokesman Higino
Carneiro denied the army had moved on UNITA strongholds but said
the government was ready to use force, including airstrikes, to
seize them.
	   ``We have no other option, now that our enemy has been
identified,'' Carneiro said at a news conference.
	   Carneiro said the army recently has taken control, ``in a
violent and coercive way,'' of 40 villages held by UNITA.
	   The Angolan government and UNITA in recent months have accused
each other of renewed military action that looks increasingly
likely to nullify the 1994 peace pact which ended a two-decade
civil war in the former Portuguese colony.
	   A 1,000-strong United Nations force monitoring implementation of
the peace accord has withdrawn from about half of the vast
southwest African nation due to sporadic clashes between the foes
in remote rural areas.
	   Morgado said government troops backed by tanks were encircling
Andulo and nearby Bailundo.
	   The troops were trying to advance but had met resistance from
the so-called presidential guard of UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi,
Morgado said.
	   The presidential guard is made up of some 400 elite and
well-armed troops, mostly guerrilla veterans war, who are dug into
strong defensive positions, according to Morgado.
	   ``They want to destroy us, and obviously we're fighting back.
We're determined not to be crushed,'' Morgado said in a telephone
interview.
	   Heavy rain also was slowing the advance of government armor, he
said.
	   The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday blamed the renewed crisis
in Angola on UNITA and demanded that it disarm and adhere to the
peace deal.
	   Under the terms of the accord, UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for
the National Union for the Total Independence for Angola _ was to
hand areas under its control to the government.
	   However, lingering hostility between the two sides has hindered
implementation of the deal, and no progress has been made since
June.
	   The civil war broke out following Angola's 1975 independence
from Portugal and some 500,000 people were killed in the fighting.

Human rights group denounces Turkish ambassador to France
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANGELA DOLAND &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French human rights group on Friday accused
Turkey's ambassador of committing human rights abuses while heading
Turkey's intelligence agency, and called for his expulsion.
	   Sonmez Koksal, Turkey's ambassador in Paris for nearly a year,
was chief of the Turkish National Intelligence Agency from 1993 to
1997.
	   France Libertes, a human rights group headed by France's former
first lady, Danielle Mitterrand, said the Turkish intelligence
agency tortured and killed Kurdish minorities under Koksal's
leadership.
	   There is no evidence that the intelligence agency has ever
carried out human rights abuses, though the Turkish government has
accused individual officers of committing such crimes.
	   Koksol declined to comment Friday, but his first counselor, Kaya
Turkmen, said: ``Mr. Koksol worked for an intelligence agency, and
like all intelligence agencies, it may attract the suspicions of
public opinion.''
	   ``Koksol doesn't consider Mrs. Mitterrand a valid
interlocutor,'' he said. ``It is not the first time she is behaving
like an accomplice of the rebels.''
	   At a news conference Friday, Mrs. Mitterrand, president of
France Libertes, called for Koksal's expulsion or trial.
	   ``The presence of this ambassador is an insult,'' said Mrs.
Mitterrand, who said she had only recently learned of Koksal's
past.
	   She said she had drafted a letter to French President Jacques
Chirac, urging him not to take a neutral position on the matter.
	   ``Isn't the presence of such a person on our soil a provocation
for human rights organizations on the eve of the 50th anniversary
of the Declaration of Human Rights?'' she wrote. France fetes the
anniversary next week.
	   Kurdish rebels in southeastern Turkey have been fighting for
autonomy since 1984. About 37,000 people have died in the struggle.
	   The question of Kurdish independence was brought to European
attention several weeks ago, when Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan was detained in Rome's airport. The Italian government has
refused to extradite Ocalan to Turkey, where he faces the death
penalty.
	   France has not yet taken a position on the matter, drawing
criticism from France Libertes.

FIFA keeps door open on Confederations Cup dates

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ FIFA President Sepp Blatter said
Friday the world body aims to kick off the controversial
Confederations Cup on July 28 next year, but could still move the
date to accommodate France.
	   FIFA last month moved the eight-nation event, to be held in
Mexico, from Jan. 8-20 to July 28-Aug. 8 to placate France, which
withdrew because of conflicts with the European club calendar.
	   However, French soccer officials still haven't decided whether
to play in the cup.
	   French Football Federation president Claude Simonet accepted the
changes. But the summer dates upset Noel Le Graet, president of the
French National League, which plans to begin its 1999-2000
championship on July 28.
	   ``We may be able to bring it forward slightly,'' Blatter said
after a meeting of FIFA's executive committee.
	   But the change could be only a matter of a few days, to prevent
the cup clashing with the end of the South American season, he
added.
	   The Copa America, the biennial South American nations
championship, is scheduled for June 29-July 8 and the Pan American
Games are slated for July 23-Aug. 8.
	   ``We'll leave it open for the time being,'' Batter said without
indicating when a decision will be made. However, he ``anticipated
that France will take part with a first-choice team.''
	   Mexico, Bolivia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, New Zealand and
the United States are also entered in the competition.
	   Also Friday, FIFA provisionally set aside a nine-day period in
January 2000 for the first edition of a new eight-team World Club
Championship.
	   The tournament will have to be coordinated with other
competitions, Blatter stressed.
	   In other business, FIFA said a proposal to adapt the FIFA
president's term of office to avoid presidential elections
coinciding with World Cup finals will be discussed at its congress
in Los Angeles next July.
	   The president is currently elected for a four-year term.
	   Blatter defeated UEFA President Lennart Johansson for the post
in June, just before the start of this year's World Cup, after a
bitter election campaign.
	   The creation of an arbitration tribunal for soccer-related
disputes will also be on the agenda, FIFA said.

U.S. presents Macedonian Army with equipment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) - The United States presented the
Macedonian army Friday with 41 Humvee vehicles, 15 trucks, five
trailers, 30 radio stations and equipment for 120 soldiers.
	   The U.S. military aid comes as small Macedonia prepares to
accept up to 1,700 NATO troops who will evacuate, if necessary,
civilians monitoring a peace deal in neighboring Kosovo.
	   The U.S. ambassador in Skopje, Christopher Hill, who is also the
main American envoy for Kosovo, said the military aid ``is designed
to assist the Macedonian forces to become more operational with the
NATO forces.''
	   In the last three years, Washington has granted over dlrs 14
million in military aid for Macedonia, and additional dlrs 1.5
million for military training.
	   Macedonia's new defense minister, Nikola Kljusev, said Friday
that in the next few weeks, the Americans will deliver additional
18 howitzers, 15 trucks, 700 MG-3 machine guns and 100 night-vision
goggle sets for the Macedonian army.
	   ``This is the sign that the U.S. respects Macedonia and that
they are opening up toward our country,'' Kljusev said.
	   Macedonia, which peacefully seceded from former Yugoslavia in
1992, still feels threatened by the regime of shrunken Yugoslavia
led by President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Macedonia borders Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic, whose
Kosovo province erupted in war this year, with local ethnic
Albanians fighting government forces to win independence.
	   Under U.S.-led initiative, Milosevic agreed to pull out some of
the government forces from Kosovo. Milosevic also agreed to allow
2,000 observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe to verify compliance on the ground.

Report: Takeover of Arrows concluded
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The German auto racing team Zakspeed
has completed a 62 million mark (dlrs 37 million) buyout of the
British Formula One team Arrows, the German sports news agency SID
reported Friday.
	   Quoting unidentified sources, SID said Zakspeed would enter
Formula One racing next season.
	   The buyout sum included a deal for Mecachrome engines, SID said.
	   The two drivers will be Mika Salo of Finland and Toranosuke
Takagi of Japan. Salo drove for Arrows last year, while Takagi
drove for Tyrrell.
	   Zakspeed already competed it the Formula One between 1985 and
1989, without much success. It picked up two points in five
seasons.

World Council of Churches chief backs reorganization to mollify
</HEADLINE>
Orthodox &QL; 
 &UR; By RICHARD N. OSTLING &QC; 
 &UR; AP Religion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The leader of the World Council of
Churches said Friday that the cooperative body, which represents up
to 450 million Christians, needs to consider the most sweeping
reorganization in its history.
	   The Rev. Konrad Raiser's proposals to the WCC's fiftieth
anniversary assembly were aimed largely at easing a worsening split
between the WCC's Protestant majority and Orthodox minority.
	   Orthodox leaders had called for such an overhaul at a crisis
meeting last May.
	   The urgency of the moment was underscored by a carefully framed
message to the WCC assembly from Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew
of Istanbul, the ``first among equals'' in the Eastern Orthodox
hierarchy.
	   Problems have long been building, he said, but after the last
WCC assembly in 1991, things ``took a critical turn.''
	   ``A series of liberal theological and moral positions were
adopted and brought into the life of the council by a variety of
member churches, mainly of the northern hemisphere,'' the patriarch
said.
	   Although he did not mention them specifically, disputes between
Protestant and Orthodox include the organization's views on
homosexuality, the role of women in the church and the uniqueness
of Christianity among world religions.
	   Along with the patriarch's letter, the 960 delegates from 330
churches heard the reading of a friendly greeting from Pope John
Paul II, head of the biggest church standing outside the WCC. As he
had done before, the pope declared his church's ``irreversible
commitment'' to work for Christian unity.
	   Raiser, the WCC's chief executive, also urged the creation of a
new, loosely knit ``forum'' of churches and Christian
organizations.
	   The forum would be a vehicle for closer links between the WCC
and those outside, not only Catholics but many Evangelicals,
Pentecostals, and followers of younger indigenous churches, he
said.
	   ``The ecumenical movement finds itself at a crossroads and in
urgent need of new orientation,'' Raiser declared. ``We cannot,
after celebrating this jubilee and affirming again that we intend
to stay together, simply return home and continue with ecumenical
business as usual.''
	   He said the Orthodox consider themselves one of the two main
Christian branches in the WCC, alongside Protestantism. But they
are ``locked into a structural minority situation'' that's unlikely
to change, said Raiser, since most of the younger churches joining
the organization are Protestant.
	   Of the two dozen denominations being taken into WCC membership
here, none is Orthodox.
	   Raiser said that Christian unity was ``being tested severely by
conflicts over moral issues, especially regarding human
sexuality.''
	   The WCC's liberal Protestant wing will be promoting gay rights
at an open forum during the gathering but it's unclear whether the
assembly itself will take any action.
	   Most Protestants run their affairs like parliamentary
democracies and so does the WCC, Raiser said. But the Orthodox and
many Third World churches ``follow different models.''
	   He suggested it might be time for ``decision-making by
consensus'' to supplant the WCC's ``governance by majority rule.''
	   Before Raiser spoke, a sober assessment came from an Orthodox
leader, Catholicos Aram I of Lebanon's Armenian Apostolic Church,
moderator of the committee that has governed the WCC since the 1991
assembly.
	   He said ``institutional ecumenism is in crisis,'' and that
``much of our constituency is disillusioned.'' Yet ``we are
witnessing a remarkable outburst of people's ecumenism'' _
spontaneous grassroots expressions of Christian unity.
	   Referring to discontent among fellow Orthodox, Aram said ``the
situation is, indeed, critical. Unless the assembly takes this
present situation seriously I fear that the Orthodox participation
will steadily dwindle.''
	   It has dwindled already to a fair extent. A number of Orthodox
delegations are downgrading their participation in the assembly and
two national Orthodox churches have quit the WCC altogether.

<TEXT>
	   SUN CITY, South Africa (AP) _ Defending champ Nick Price
continued his dominance of this Gary Player Country Club course,
shooting a 4-under par 68 Friday and adding to his first round 67
at the Million Dollar Challenge.
	   Breathing down his neck a shot back was fellow 41-year-old Mark
O'Meara, the American two-time major winner, who scored a 67 for a
two-round total of 136.
	   The younger generation was just behind. English star Lee
Westwood, 25, and Justin Leonard, 26, of the United States were
both at 137 for 7-under par after two rounds.
	   Price played conservative par golf over the first seven holes
but then dropped a shot on the par-4 eighth, where he over cut his
5-iron second shot. He erred on a downhill chip and had to sink a
tough 15-footer for bogey.
	   But the Zimbabwean, also 1993 winner with a record 24-under par
on the 7,597-yard (6,947-meter) Gary Player Country Club course,
roared back with four straight birdies around the turn.
	   He gained another stroke on the 15th, where he hit a 9-iron to 9
feet and made the put.
	   ``I was not particularly concerned about being in the lead,''
Price said. ``I just wanted to be one or two back,'' at least, he
said.
	   Price is clearly at ease here. He knows the course well, is
playing in front of family and does best in the heat. The sun was
hot Friday in the South African summer after cool, rainy weather
earlier in the week, improving the course and accounting for better
scores all around.
	   ``I'm not going out there and worrying too much about what the
others are doing,'' he said of the elite 12-man field, which
includes Tiger Woods, David Duval and Ernie Els in the dlrs 2.57
million tournament. Els was 5 under par, Woods 4 and Duval 1 over
at 145 after two days.
	   O'Meara also bounced back from a front-nine bogey, which he
suffered on the par-4 third. Last year's PGA player of the year
found the sand with his approach and then three-putted.
	   O'Meara birdied on holes 5, 6, 8 and 9 to reach the turn at 33.
A third straight birdie on the 10th was cancelled out when he made
a 1 over 5 on the 13th. He answered back with a birdie 4 on the
14th and added another stroke on the last hole.
	   The round of the day belonged to Westwood _ who was level par
Thursday _ with an 8-birdie 65, marred only by a 1 over 5 at the
opening hole.
	   ``I struggled with my putting yesterday. Now it's in shape,'' he
said. ``I thought it was going to be a long day. Then on the 2nd I

said he raised his hands on the putter.
	   He was paired with Woods, who shot a 68, and said the two of
them spent the day laughing and joking.
	   ``I like playing with Tiger, and we both play better when we're
together,'' Westwood said.

Maoist rebels killed for disrupting election campaigns in Nepal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Police shot and killed at least 10 rebels
who were trying to disrupt election campaigns in central Nepal,
police said.
	   Five Maoist rebels died in the gunbattle Thursday near
Karchabang village in Rolpa District, about 190 miles (300
kilometers) west of Katmandu, the Nepalese capital. The rebels had
earlier tried to kidnap election officials traveling through the
jungles before a vote later this month, police said.
	   In the neighboring Salyan District, police shot and killed five
rebels Thursday in two separate incidents.
	   The government began the process of holding local elections in
four districts that have been hit by insurgency. Elections were put
off in these districts last year after both candidates and voters
stayed away from polling booths after Maoists called for a boycott.
	   Police said many guerrillas have moved to these areas to disrupt
the Dec. 18 elections.
	   Since the insurgency began more than two years ago, 350 people
have been killed, including 24 security personnel and 84 civilians.
The guerrillas oppose Nepal's constitutional monarchy and want the
country to be turned into a republic state.

Newspaper calls for ouster of government in coming elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICHARD SIMON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ The island's leading weekly
newspaper called on voters to oust the ruling New National Party in
an editorial Friday as Grenada moved toward early elections after
Parliament was dissolved.
	   The government of Prime Minister Keith Mitchell must be defeated
to end the ``corruption and deceitful government'' that has brought
political turmoil to the Caribbean nation in recent weeks, the
newspaper said.
	   Governor General Sir Daniel Williams dissolved Parliament on
Wednesday, meaning elections must be held within 90 days in the
former British colony. A date has not yet been set.
	   On Sunday, Foreign and Legal Affairs Minister Raphael Fletcher
resigned, accusing Mitchell's government of corruption.
	   The newspaper cited Mitchell's firing of former Deputy Prime
Minister Grace Duncan after her romance with Mitchell soured, and
the dismissal of another junior minister.
	   The editorial also criticized Mitchell for awarding
ambassador-at-large posts to Viktor Korzeny, a controversial
businessman who amassed millions by taking advantage of
privatization programs in his home country, former Czechoslovakia,
and Joan Webley, a former politician in Jamaica.
	   Opponents of Mitchell complained to the United Nations earlier
this year that Webley, who runs a U.N. program in Grenada, was also
working as a political adviser to Mitchell instead of remaining
politically neutral.

Foreign Ministry official with anti-NATO leanings censured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Opposition lawmakers on Friday challenged
whether a Foreign Ministry official who said Germany no longer
needs a standing army was suited for government.
	   The opposition Christian Democrats, voted out of government
after 16 years in office in September, called a parliamentary
debate to censure Ludger Volmer, a Foreign Ministry official and a
left-wing Greens party member, for his statement to reporters.
	   ``You awaken with these comments legitimate doubts about whether
you are qualified for you post,'' said Werner Siemann of the
Christian Democrats.
	   Volmer, who belongs to the Greens' anti-NATO wing, said his
remarks were in full agreement with the coalition contract agreed
to by the Social Democrats and the Greens. The agreement calls for
a military structure commission to examine possible reductions in
the armed forces and military conscription.
	   Volmer asked lawmakers challenging him to consider against whom
the German army and navy intends to defend itself.
	   Volmer was defended by Peter Zumkley of the Social Democrats,
who accused the opposition of blowing up into a debate an aside
made during an interview. ``There are more important things than
this,'' he said.
	   However, others in the governing coalition, including government
spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye, have distanced themselves from the
remark, saying it was a personal opinion, not government position.

Two dead, dozens injured in Portuguese school bus accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A school bus carrying some 50 youths
went off the road and into a ravine Friday, killing two teenagers
and injuring dozens, news reports said.
	   The accident occurred in the town of Marco de Canaveses, about
300 kilometers (185 miles) north of Lisbon, when a truck forced the
double-decker bus off the road, Lisbon radio TSF said.
	   ``A truck was coming in the opposite direction and the bus
swerved to avoid it,'' one 15-year-old girl survivor told TSF.
	   State radio Antena 1 said the bus overturned into a 10 to
15-meter (33 to 50-foot) deep ravine.
	   Two teenagers, aged 16 and 17, died, and dozens of others were
injured, state radio Antena 1 said.
	   It was not immediately clear how many were seriously injured.

Two priests on trial in Sudan facing death penalty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ In what has been described as an attempt to
discredit the Roman Catholic Church in Sudan, two priests have gone
on trial and risk the death penalty on charges of setting off bombs
in Khartoum on June 30.
	   Fides, the news agency of the Vatican's missionary service, says
the two priests have been tortured by Khartoum police.
	   The priests, the Rev. Hilary Boma and the Rev. Lino Sebit, were
arrested in a mass roundup in August and went on trial Oct. 6 at
the Sudanese air force headquarters with 18 co-defendants, Fides
said.
	   Christians in Sudan have reported oppression by the government
during the 15-year-old war pitting Khartoum's Muslim
fundamentalist-backed government against rebels in the mainly
Christian and animist south.
	   Fides said 18 of the defendants are Christians and two are
Muslims.
	   News reports have said the two priests risk crucifixion under
Sudan's Islamic legal code. The Rev. Bernardo Cervellera, the Fides
director, said that seemed unlikely but that there was a risk of
the death penalty should they be convicted.
	   Fides said Boma, in a meeting with four priests who were allowed
to visit him Oct. 1, said he signed a confession to stop police
from torturing Sebit before his eyes.
	   Boma is accused of belonging to the Sudan Peoples Liberation
Army and with heading a group of 19 guerrillas charged with blowing
up an electric power station and making attempts on the life of
leading government members.
	   Fides said the arrests of the priests ``seems to be part of an
attempt to discredit the Sudanese Catholic church.''
	   In the last two years, the agency says, nine centers run by the
church have been destroyed or confiscated.

Taiwan's ruling party hopes to snuff opposition in mayor's race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: LEADS in grafs 16-17 with Chen quotes, color and TRIMS. No

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The politicians who run Taiwan hope to
rebuild support and wipe away hints of corruption Saturday with a
candidate who calls himself squeaky clean _ though he freely admits
spending too much money on the campaign.
	   Ma Ying-jeou promises a full, honest accounting of his excesses
after voters make their choice in the Taipei mayoral race. The
contest is the focal point of elections seen as a barometer for the
bigger call Taiwanese must make 16 months later when they pick a
successor to President Lee Teng-hui.
	   ``The spending has become a joke,'' Ma said, adding that Taiwan
``cannot wait to form a democratic institution with substance _ we
need to clean up.''
	   The races are nasty on the surface _ plenty of ethnic
disparagement and allegations of whoremongering _ but the broader
issue of Taiwan's delicate status vis-a-vis mainland China lingers
more quietly.
	   Taipei voters may back Ma, the Nationalist Party candidate, if
they're spooked by the idea that re-electing the opposition mayor,
Chen Shui-bian, could someday push Taiwan toward a deadly
confrontation with China. Taiwan and China were separated by civil
war in 1949; Beijing considers Taiwan a renegade province.
	   The platform of Chen's Democratic Progressive Party calls for
Taiwan to formally state its independence.
	   In their hearts, many Taiwanese favor the idea, but they can't
forget the tense standoff three years ago, when China demonstrated
its views on Taiwanese sovereignty by test-firing missiles off the
coast.
	   Chen has refused to tout his party's call for independence but
instead questioned the loyalty of Ma _ who was born to mainland
parents but moved to Taiwan at age 1.
	   If Chen hangs on to power, the DPP keeps the biggest plum it has
picked since martial law ended in 1987 _ which could help the
opposition's hopes of electing its first president in 2000.
	   If Ma and the Nationalists can reclaim Taipei, they could halt
the advance of the DPP and possibly restore a popularity that
crumbled amid perceptions of dirty dealing and embarrassing losses
in last year's local elections.
	   The Taipei mayoral race is too close to call, with a long shot
candidate from the tiny New Party _ Wang Chien-shien _ expected to
take more votes away from Ma than from Chen.
	   The governing Nationalist Party is likely to retain control of
the Legislature, which is being expanded to 225 seats. Voters also
will choose a Taipei city council and a mayor and council in the
big southern city, Kaohsiung.
	   Democracy, merely a decade-old phenomenon in Taiwan, has turned
into a raucous show. The campaigners were out early Friday,
parading in wildly decked out trucks and jeeps, pounding drums in a
tribal rhythm and blaring messages through megaphones.
	   At one rally, the president took the stage to lend his
considerable support to Ma.
	   ``I'm the best helmsman, taking you to the good life, but this
ship must continue its course,'' Lee said.
	   As the DPP closed its campaign, Chen's voice was scratchy and
weak.
	   ``I have faced a very tough challenge in this race, but I am not
afraid,'' Chen said Friday. ``I have no fear of China. What else
should I be afraid of?''
	   No politician who favors reunification dares say so publicly,
just as those who prefer a bold claim of independence keep quiet
for fear of provoking a military attack from Beijing.
	   In the boisterous campaign, violence has been down from previous
elections and arrests for vote buying purportedly have been
confined to rural areas where people were offered cooking oil and a
few dollars for their support.

Grinding poverty leads some Romanians to give up the dentist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Impoverished Romanians are cutting
back on dental costs in one eastern city by getting their neighbors
to extract painful molars, the national news agency reported
Friday.
	   Dentists in Buzau recently hiked the price of a tooth extraction
from 25,000 (dlrs 2.5) lei to 40,000 lei (dlrs 4) in line with
yearly inflation of 40 percent, Rompres reported.
	   This made some people resort to home dental treatment, asking
neighbors and friends, to extract painful teeth using spanners and
other household tools.
	   As a result, dentists in Buzau some 120 kilometers (75 miles)
northeast of Bucharest are going out of business with only people
in extreme pain sitting in the dentist's chair.
	   The average monthly salary is 1.2 million lei (dlrs 120) in
Romania, but many people make much less.

Sun and sand not enough for Greece to be competitive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By THEODORA TONGAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Sunny skies and sandy beaches may rank as
Greece's main tourist attractions, but more may be needed if the
country wants to be a competitive destination for foreigner
visitors.
	   ``It is not an honor for a country to have its cities bypassed
by many foreign tourists who immediately go to the beaches,
considering them to be the only thing worth visiting or the only
thing that can be visited,'' said Athens mayor Dimitris
Avramopoulos.
	   Speaking at a tourism conference here, the popular mayor of the
country's biggest city complained that Greece has gone from the
cradle of history and civilization, to a land that only emphasizes
sand and sun. As a result, it mostly attracts visitors with those
limited interests.
	   Many tourists head straight for one of hundreds of islands
dotting the Aegean Sea. They typically ignore the rest of the
country and its capital, a concrete sprawl that is home to nearly
half the country's 10.2 million people.
	   With Athens to host the 2004 Olympics, Avramopoulos has launched
an ambitious program to beautify the city and make it a more
livable place by promoting pedestrian areas in its historic center,
planting more trees, and expanding the city's few green spots.
	   Increased tourism to neighboring Turkey and other Mediterranean
destinations have also been giving Greece stiff competition in
recent years, forcing Greeks to try and broaden their offerings.
	   The government has tried to promote alternative tourism, such as
biking, trekking, rafting, skiing and winter sports. But although
popular with Greeks, the government's efforts have been
half-hearted and attracted few foreigners.
	   ``It is wrong for tourist interests and investments to be
gathered on a few islands and mainland communities, leaving the
great majority of Greek land unexploited,'' Avramopoulos said.
	   He pointed out that many mountain villages are abandoned, and
what few hotels they have are often unheated in winter. The former
high-ranking diplomat said that travel by car makes tourists bypass
scenic attractions, but the bicycle and pedestrian trails to take
visitors to them are nonexistent.
	   ``Greece's richness remains unexploited, or it is left to
deteriorate,'' the mayor said. ``Greece offers an infinite number
of small islands and places on mountains that are unknown or
inaccessible to visitors.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details, Cabinet posts

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Prime Minister-Designate Salim Hoss
appointed a Cabinet Friday with many fresh faces and without two
militia leaders who had held power in the previous government.
	   The Cabinet comprised 16 members, slightly more than half of the
30-member government of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, in what
appeared a first step toward implementing Hoss's declared policy of
austerity.
	   Hoss appointed himself as foreign minister and also took the
portfolio of immigrant affairs.
	   He chose Nasser Saidi, a vice-governor of the central bank, as
minister of economy and trade as well as minister of industry.
	   The prime minister retained only two members of Hariri's
government: Michel Murr, who remains deputy prime minister and
interior minister and takes on rural and municipal affairs as well,
and Suleiman Franjieh, who was appointed minister of agriculture
and the housing and cooperatives minister.
	   Franjieh was a Christian militia leader during the civil war.
	   His fellow former warlords, Druze leader Walid Jumblatt and
Christian militia leader Elie Hobeika, were left out of the new
Cabinet.
	   The Cabinet respects Lebanon's traditional power-sharing
arrangement, which divides seats equally between Christians and
Muslims.
	   Hoss, who was appointed prime minister earlier this week, made
the announcement after a meeting with President Emile Lahoud.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ciller's party opposing any coalition with rival
Yilmaz; EDITS to conform, TRIM &QL; 
 &UR; By SUZAN FRASER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's party
made clear Friday it would oppose any coalition that includes her
bitter center-right rival Mesut Yilmaz, dimming the chances that
premier-designate Bulent Ecevit can form a majority government.
	   Veteran leftist politician Ecevit was asked this week to form a
government to replace the 17-month-old one that went down when
Yilmaz lost a confidence vote last month.
	   Tapped earlier in the week to form a new government, staunchly
pro-secular Ecevit has made clear that he would refuse to turn to
parliament's largest party, the pro-Islamic Virtue party, for a
majority.
	   Virtue's predecessor, the pro-Islamic Welfare party, was
pressured by the military last year into resigning.
	   But if Mrs. Ciller sticks to her refusal to join the three-party
team proposed by Ecevit, virtually the only government that could
be formed without the Islamic forces would be a minority coalition
with outside support in parliament from the center-right.
	   That was the same formula used by Yilmaz to avoid governing with
Mrs. Ciller.
	   Her True Path party decided after a meeting Friday to reject any
proposal that would put them in the same coalition with Yilmaz.
	   ``That would mean the revival of a government that was just
toppled because of irregularities in state contracts, corruption
and links to gangs,'' said Mrs. Ciller's close aide Hasan Ekinci,
referring to allegations about the Yilmaz coalition.
	   ``We tried a coalition before and everyone knows how that
ended,'' he said referring to a three-month alliance in 1996 which
collapsed when Yilmaz backed corruption probes against Mrs. Ciller.
	   Ecevit is scheduled to meet with Yilmaz on Saturday and Mrs.
Ciller on Monday.
	   On Friday, Yilmaz, now caretaker premier, met with top army
brass to reportedly discuss the cases of some 50 officers suspected
of ties to radical Islam.
	   The military, which has asserted itself as the guarantor of
Turkey's secular traditions, has sacked hundreds of officers in the
last two years in a bid to rid the army ranks of alleged militant
Islamic tendencies.
	   Turkey's five largest labor and trade confederations are
pressing political leaders to back Ecevit's efforts to form a new
pro-secular government.
	   ``The country needs political and economic stability today more
than ever,'' said a confederation leader Dervis Gunday.

Three Israeli soldiers injured by friendly fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Two Israeli soldiers and an allied Lebanese
militia man were injured Friday when they mistakenly opened fire on
one another in southern Lebanon, the army said.
	   The incident in the eastern sector of the Israeli-occupied zone
began when a Lebanese shepherd mistook Israeli soldiers on patrol
in the area for Shiite Muslim Hezbollah guerrillas, the army said.
	   The shepherd alerted members of the Israeli-allied South Lebanon
Army militia stationed nearby. SLA troops opened fire on the
Israeli soldiers. In an exchange of fire, two Israeli soldiers and
an SLA member were injured. The two Israelis were in stable
condition and the SLA man was seriously hurt.
	   In Israel, debate has been growing over Israel's 16-year
military presence in southern Lebanon. Israel and the SLA are
patrolling the area to prevent cross-border raids by Hezbollah.
	   Seven Israeli soldiers were killed in Lebanon in the past three
weeks, and there have been renewed calls for a unilateral Israeli
troop pullback.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai has said, however, he
would not withdraw the soldiers without first negotiating a
security agreement with the Lebanese government. Lebanon has
rejected the offer, saying Israel must withdraw without conditions.
	   In making the argument, Mordechai suggested that he had the
broad backing of Israel's security chiefs.
	   However, the Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot said Friday that both
the head of the domestic Shin Bet security service, Ami Ayalon, and
the former Israeli commander in south Lebanon, Maj. Gen. Amiram
Levine, supported a unilateral withdrawal.
	   Ayalon argued for such a pullback in a meeting of security
chiefs at Mordechai's office last week, Yediot said. At the
meeting, Levine also voiced his opposition to keeping Israeli
troops in southern Lebanon, but favored a gradual pullout, Yediot
said.

Congo, Zimbabwe launch attack on southern rebel town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Despite promises of a cease-fire,
Congolese government troops and their Zimbabwean allies used
artillery, tanks and aircraft to attack rebel positions in
southeastern Congo, the rebel leader said Friday.
	   But Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, speaking from the Ugandan capital,
said the rebels held ground after fighting Thursday and early
Friday in Kabalo, 300 kilometers (185 miles) southwest of the
eastern rebel stronghold at Goma.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the report. Last week,
rebel troops and their Rwandan allies faced Zimbabwean soldiers
across the Nzofu Bridge over the Congo River, which guarded the
entrance to Kabalo 14 kilometers (8 miles) away.
	   Zimbabwe, along with Angola, Namibia and Chad have sent troops
and equipment to back the forces of Congolese President Laurent
Kabila after Rwandan and Ugandan-backed Congolese rebels took up
arms Aug. 2 to topple him.
	   At a summit in Paris last week, leaders of Rwanda, Uganda,
Zimbabwe and Congo had pledged to work toward a cease-fire, but
failed to agree on concrete proposals.
	   Wamba, who on Saturday will discuss Congo with Ugandan President
Yoweri Museveni, said peace talks to discuss ceasefire proposals in
Lusaka, Zambia Dec. 9 had been postponed to a later date. He said
his rebel Congolese Democratic Coalition had not received an
invitation yet, but hoped to participate.
	   So far, Congolese President Laurent Kabila has refused to
negotiate directly with the rebel coalition of ethnic Tutsis,
disaffected soldiers and opposition politicians, instead demanding
that Rwanda and Uganda withdraw their support for the insurgents.
	   Both countries say they will stay on as long as Congo remains
unstable.
	   ``An intention for a need to move toward a cease-fire was just
an intension, now that we know that Kabila and Zimbabwe have
attacked Kabalo with a full force.''

	   ___ &QC;  'Christmas Tree Man' has tall task each year
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Picking a Christmas tree takes most people a few
minutes, a couple hours if they head to the woods. Dave Murbach
needs 11 months.
	   Almost every day of every year, Murbach's thoughts turn to
visions of a perfectly shaped evergreen behemoth that will take
everyone's breath away.
	   ``The Tree,'' he says wearily. ``Always the Tree.''
	   Murbach is the man responsible for finding the towering
tannenbaum that graces Manhattan's Rockefeller Center each
Christmas season.
	   ``Typically, I'm always looking for a tree,'' the Center's chief
gardener says. ``I look for it even when I go to the beach in the
summer. It's like a homework assignment hanging over your head.''
	   And if he goofs, there's no hiding it.
	   ``Every day it's up, 400,000 people go by, and 2 1/2 million
people watch the lighting celebration on television,'' he says.
	   This year's tree, a 74-foot Norway spruce from Richfield, Ohio,
flown to New York last week on the world's largest cargo plane,
will be lighted Dec. 2.
	   The arrival of the tree ushers in the Christmas season in New
York _ a tradition dating to 1931, when the workers building
Rockefeller Center put up a small tree with makeshift ornaments.
	   The search for the next year's tree starts soon after the old
tree is chopped up for wood chips and horse-jumping logs.
	   Murbach has three criteria: The tree must be at least 65 feet
high, at least 35 feet across and lush _ dense enough not to see
through.
	   That's not as simple as it sounds. Though forests are full of
evergreens, few get enough sunlight or space to fill out. And
branches in snowy climes often break under the weight, making trees
uneven.
	   Back at the office, he sorts through hundreds of letters from
people offering their trees, many addressed simply to 'Mr.
Christmas Tree Man'.
	   Despite the occasional anxiety attack and sleepless night,
Murbach knows the effect the tree has on people: ``It's for
bringing people together, attempting to bring together people you
love. That's what I hope it triggers.''
	   But Murbach says he's always too worn out to celebrate
Christmas.
	   ``No cards, no lights, nothing,'' he says.
	   No tree?
	   ``No tree.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Use information from the story to answer the following true and
false questions:
	   _____ 1. Dave Murbach grows the trees that are exhibited in
Manhattan's Rockefeller Center each Christmas season.
	   _____ 2. It takes the Center's chief gardener 11 months to
decide on the perfect evergreen (tree that stays green all year).
	   _____ 3. The only time that Murbach is not looking for a tree is
when he is at the beach.
	   _____ 4. In order for the ``Tree Man'' to consider a tree, its
height must measure at least 30 feet more than its width.
	   _____ 5. The best evergreens have lots of space between their
branches.
	   _____ 6. Old trees are used to make wood chips and logs.
	   _____ 7. Many people write to Murbach offering their trees for
display.
	   _____ 8. This year's 74-foot Norway spruce was transported to
New York from Ohio in the world's largest car.
	   _____ 9. When the towering tree is in place, 400,000 people will
decorate it with handmade ornaments.
	   _____ 10. The New York tradition of welcoming the holiday season
with a huge tree began 31 years ago.
	   _____ Bonus: It is likely that Murbach takes his job so
seriously because he wants everyone to be happy with his choice.
	   ____ &QC; 
	   HERE'S YOUR HOMEWORK: Dave Murbach thinks of his search for the
perfect tree as a homework assignment that lasts 11 months! Write
an essay describing a homework assignment that took you a long time

Base destroyed, 70 rebels killed in bombing campaign, ECOMOG says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Nigerian military jets destroyed a
Sierra Leonean rebel base in four days of bombing raids, killing at
least 70 fighters and capturing a swath of rebel-held territory,
military officers said Friday.
	   The attacks between Tuesday and Friday against the rebel base
near the town of Gberay, about 75 miles (125 kilometers) north of
Sierra Leone's capital, was launched by the Nigerian-led West
African intervention force called ECOMOG, intervention force
spokesman Paul Aghimimen said.
	   The rebels include remnants of Sierra Leone's junta which was
ousted from the capital by ECOMOG earlier this year. Together with
a traditional Sierra Leonean militia force, ECOMOG troops and
planes continue to support the restored government of President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
	   The junta took power during a bloody May 1997 coup that forced
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah into 10 months of hiding.
	   Aghimimen said the raids resulted in the capture of a 40-mile
(60 kilometer) stretch of road linking the northeast town of Makeni
with the capital.
	   No civilians were killed in the latest raids and ECOMOG promised
not to launch attacks against targets where villagers and other
non-combatants are at risk, Aghimimen said.
	   The rebels have been blamed by aid workers and villagers for
committing thousands of murders, torture and rape against innocent
civilians in an apparent campaign of revenge for their ouster.

<TEXT>
	   PONCE, Puerto Rico (AP) _ It will take four years and millions
of dollars to clean up mercury-contaminated soil at a site formerly
used by General Electric in the southern town of Juana Diaz,
officials said.
	   In an interview late Thursday, two top regional officials of the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said efforts to treat the soil
to remove the mercury were unsuccessful so it would have to be
removed.
	   ``Right now we are designing a remediation process, but we are
talking about two years to present a remediation plan and two more
for the removal,'' said Ramon Torres, EPA emergency coordinator.
	   Carl Axel Soderberg, EPA Caribbean director, estimated the cost
of the cleanup would reach ``millions'' of dollars.
	   ``These grounds represent a danger and that's why we are going
to remove them,'' Soderberg said.
	   Both officials said that while mercury had contaminated the
ground, it had not entered water wells in the area.
	   The cleanup will be paid for by the EPA's Superfund and the
government will seek reimbursement from General Electric, the
officials said.

Court rules some stores can remain open on Jewish Sabbath
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a landmark ruling, an Israeli court said
some stores can remain open on the Jewish Sabbath.
	   The ruling was seen as a victory for secular rights activists
fighting against what they see as religious coercion.
	   Observant and secular Jews find themselves increasingly at odds
over what role religion should play in daily life. One of the
battle grounds is observance of the Jewish Sabbath which runs from
sundown Friday to sundown Saturday.
	   Under Jewish law, all work and commercial activity is banned
during the Sabbath and traditionally, shops in Israel have been
closed during the biblically mandated day of rest.
	   However, the Jerusalem District Court ruled Thursday that stores
in kibbutzim, or communal farms, can operate during the Sabbath.
Most kibbutzim are secular communities.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the ruling, saying
that it made a distinction between kibbutz members and other
Israelis, Israel TV's Channel Two said Friday.
	   Netanyahu was quoted as saying he favored keeping the status
quo.
	   Kibbutz leaders, in turn, accused Netanyahu of pandering to the
three religious parties that are key members of his shaky
coalition.

Palestinian police arrest student who took soldier's weapon

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ A Palestinian university student who
participated in an attack on an Israeli soldier and seized his M-16
assault rifle has been arrested, a senior Palestinian official said
Friday.
	   The rifle was handed over to the governor of the West Bank town
of Ramallah hours after about a dozen Palestinians pelted an
Israeli car with stones Wednesday, pulled the soldier out of the
vehicle and struck him repeatedly in the head with rocks.
	   The soldier escaped with head injuries. The incident, captured
by TV cameras, triggered an outrage in Israel and led to Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to suspend the upcoming West
Bank troop withdrawal.
	   The Palestinian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the M-16 was handed over by Palestinian university students
not involved in the attack on the soldier.
	   One of the students was held for questioning, however, and later
the student who had seized the M-16 was arrested. The officials
wouldn't identify the student.
	   The army spokesman's office said the Palestinian Authority had
pledged to take steps against those involved in the attack.
	   A preliminary Israeli army investigation into the incident found
that the soldier under attack, Cpl. Assaf Meyara, 19, should have
fired on his assailants, the Yediot Ahronot daily said.
	   Meyara will likely be charged in military court with violating
army procedures, the newspaper said.
	   However, the army spokesman's office said that although Meyera
did violate army procedure by carrying a weapon that was unloaded,
the investigation was still ongoing as to whether he should have
loaded it and opened fire.
	   Meyera's mother Lisa said she was taken aback by the onslaught
of criticism complaining that her son didn't use his gun.
	   ``It basically makes me feel that they prefer having him open
fire and end up dead - a dead hero,'' Meyera said in an interview
with Associated Press Television News.
	   Israel and the Palestinians have blamed each other for the
violence, which came days before U.S. President Bill Clinton was to
arrive in the region to usher in the second stage of the Wye River
land-for-security agreement.

Ice hockey player Silver died of heart attack, autopsy says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with news conference &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Canadian-Swiss ice hockey player Chad
Silver, who was found dead in his bed, died of a heart attack,
according to autopsy results released Friday.
	   Christina Achour, spokeswoman for Zurich police, said the
autopsy ruled out a connection between Silver's death and any
injury suffered Tuesday in his last game for the Zurich-based ZSC
lions.
	   He played to the end of the game against Davos although Swiss
television has replayed footage showing his head hitting the ice
hard after a collision.
	   Gery Buesser, the team physician, told a news conference that it
wasn't clear whether Silver's coronary was brought on by a problem
with his heart rhythm.
	   A cardiologist checked him and other members of the team
thoroughly two weeks ago, said Buesser. In addition to the usual
procedures, the cardiologist used ultrasound to check the heart
area and found nothing unusual, he added. Silver was in very good
shape.
	   Beat Villiger, Davos team physician, told the Zurich station
Radio Z on Friday that the pathologist had looked for a brain blood
clot, but found none.
	   The body of Silver, 29, was found in his Zurich apartment
Thursday after he failed to report for practice.
	   Investigating Judge Daniel Regenmass said there was no
indication of violence. Simon Schenk, club sports director, said
Silver took no drugs and a recent doping test on the player was
negative.
	   Villiger said tests are being conducted on blood and tissue
samples to determine whether doping or drugs were involved, but
that it would take about 10 days to know the results.
	   Investigators, however, found nothing in Silver's flat that
would indicate he had been using any prohibited substances, he
added.
	   Villiger said a recent increase in deaths of hockey players
could be attributed more to congenital and acquired heart problems
than to the sport.
	   But he said that because of the trend, the Swiss Association of
Sports Physicians had developed an examination program. Silver
underwent the checkup two weeks ago, but nothing unusual was
detected, he added.

South African Breweries makes shift to London
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South African Breweries Ltd.
said Friday it plans to shift its primary listing of shares to the
London Stock Exchange but made assurances it was not abandoning
South Africa and would indeed strengthen its operations here.
	   SAB Managing Director Graham Mackay said a London listing would
elevate the company's competitiveness with international brewers.
	   The planned shift by SAB _ one of the top six brewers in the
world in terms of volume and sales _ comes less than two months
after Anglo American PLC, a mining conglomerate and currently South
Africa's largest corporate entity, announced it was moving its
headquarters to London to raise its profile as a global operation
and increase its ability to tap financial markets.
	   Mackay said he is aiming to list SAB on the London Stock
Exchange next March, around the same time as Anglo American's
scheduled debut on that stock exchange.
	   Mackay said he had spoken to South African Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki about the proposed listing and that President Nelson
Mandela also was aware of it.
	   ``There were no problems, it was more a courtesy call,'' Mackay
said.
	   The company will be holding a special general meeting in January
of shareholders, who will vote on the move.
	   ``I don't think it will be controversial,'' Mackay said.
	   The move ``will allow us to build on our international beverage
operations and accelerate international expansion, while continuing
to invest in and strengthen our existing operations in South
Africa,'' Mackay said in a statement to the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange, where the company will have secondary listings of shares.
	   SAB holds interests in various beer-making enterprises in
sub-Saharan Africa, central Europe and China.
	   Since the beginning of 1995, SAB has invested dlrs 660 million
in the domestic brewing market and a further dlrs 825 million
offshore.
	   On another front, Mackay emphatically denied that SAB is has
been approached by an international brewing rival as part of a
takeover attempt. Speculation has been rife in local financial
markets that Holland-based Heineken and U.S.-based Anheuser-Busch
breweries are stalking the group.
	   Founded in 1895, SAB is the oldest continuously listed stock on
the JSE.

Fiji avenge defeat to win Dubai title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ World champion Fiji avenged
its defeat here last year, beating title holder New Zealand 31-22
to land the Emirates International Trophy in a thrilling final
Friday night.
	   The Fijians, who were narrowly beaten by the All Blacks in the
recent Commonwealth Games final in Kuala Lumpur, ran in five tries
to four, with scrum half Rokini Kiliraki sealing victories with
three conversions.
	   Kiliraki, named Player of the Tournament, set up many moves and
helped the Fijians keep up the pressure throughout the final, with
some judicious passing and swerves.
	   ``We were determined to make up for our performance in Dubai
last year and we did just that,'' Fiji manager Jone Buakula said
after picking up the dlrs 25,000 first prize.
	   ``This is a wonderful moment for us,'' he added. ``I am very
proud of the team for the spirit they have showed and want to thank
all the fans for their great support over the last two days.''
	   New Zealand took the lead in the final when the powerful Brad
Fleming went over for the first of his two tries from an overlap.
But the Fijians grabbed the lead through a converted try by Jope
Tuikabe.
	   Sirilo Lala then increased the advantage. But the New Zealanders
were on level terms at half-time, when skipper Dallas Seymour
passed to Fleming who touched down under the posts, presenting an
easy conversion for Damien Karuana.
	   The irrepressible Marika Vunibaka pulled Fiji ahead immediately
after the break using his pace and build to power over 70 meters,
and Kiliraki added the extra points for a 19-12 lead.
	   Amasio Valence gave New Zealand a lifeline when he muscled over
for a try after Fleming had made the initial run along the left
side. Karuana failed with the conversion.
	   Fiji then took control of the game through quick tries by
Kiliraki and Lala as the New Zealanders committed handling errors,
though skipper Dallas Seymour scored the final try of the match for
the All Blacks.
	   ``Fiji maintained pressure on us and the better team won
today,'' said New Zealand manager Ross Thurston. ``But we will meet
again soon.''
	   France won the Emirates Plate event, drubbing South African side
Natal 40-7 in the final to make up for its earlier elimination from
the main event.
	   Fiji and New Zealand had contrasting paths to the final, with
Western Samoa stretching the reigning world sevens champions before
going down 29-21 in a stirring semifinal that brought out the best
in both sides.
	   The Samoans, who came from behind to beat Scotland in the
quarters, took the fight to the Fijians, but left their charge too
late after being 22-0 down at the first half.
	   Marika Vunibaka, last year's Player of the Tournament, displayed
his punishing speed to ground two tries while scrum half Rokini
Kiliraki, Sirilo Lala and Vilomoni Deasau scored one apiece.
	   Orene Ai'i almost saw Samoa through to a remarkable victory with
his pace, upsetting the fine rhythm of the Fijians. But despite a
try from him and one each from Afato Sp'oalo and Saito Sililito - a
stunning effort after a raking run by Ai'i - the Samoans were
unable to catch up with the Fijians, who used their typically
aggressive tackling to stop their rivals.
	   New Zealand made use of their superior sevens skills to oust
Australia 29-0, with young star Rico Gear planting two tries,
covering a distance of over 60 meters to score the second try,
after Australian Stephen Devine's move towards the New Zealand try
line was foiled.
	   The Australians had their chances, but messed up meters in front
of the Kiwi try line and had no answer when their opponents began
to run the ball from wing to wing.
	   Brad Fleming, one of the lynchpins of the Kiwi campaign here,
scored the first try while Craig de Goldie and Rua Tipoki planted
one apiece.
	   Fiji overcame gutsy Canada 35-12 in the quarters while New
Zealand overwhelmed Zimbabwe 45-5, though the African side had the
distinction of being the first team to breach the defense of the
reigning Dubai champions this year.

Parliament urges Moscow city to restore statue of dreaded police

 &UR; By ANGELA CHARLTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ It inspired, even comforted, Communists, and
terrified democrats and human rights activists.
	   The statue of infamous Soviet secret police chief Felix
Dzerzhinsky loomed before the KGB headquarters until it was toppled
by euphoric pro-democracy protesters in 1991. Seven years after
Russia became a democracy, the Communist-dominated Russian
parliament formally approved a measure Friday calling for the
statue's resurrection.
	   The measure passed 255-102 after two heated debates that
reflected the chasm between those who champion the Soviet collapse
and the Communists and other hard-liners who view the Soviet era
fondly _ and bitterly lament Russia's post-Soviet decline.
	   The document says the restored statue would be a ``symbol of the
fight against crime in Russia.''
	   Crime has become a major problem in post-Soviet Russia, with
official corruption, organized crime, murders and violent robberies
a pervasive part of life. Russians, including many who do not
support the Communists, are deeply unhappy about the lawlessness
and several political parties have tried to harness that
discontent.
	   ``Replacing the statue will reassure the nation,'' Nikolai
Kharitonov, leader of the Communist-allied Agrarian Party, said
when the measure was first proposed Wednesday.
	   Russia's beleaguered reformers see Dzerzhinsky as a criminal
himself.
	   ``Dzerzhinsky was one of the most horrible butchers in history,
with a multitude of innocent victims on his conscience,'' said
lawmaker Yuri Rybakov, a member of the Russia's Democratic Choice
party. ``How can we possibly reinstate his statue?''
	   The Duma's resolution, which is non-binding, urges the Moscow
city government to restore the monument. But the city legislature _
where Communists are far less influential than they are in the
national parliament _ must approve all such decisions.
	   Moscow's powerful Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a leading presidential
hopeful, said Friday he opposed restoring the statue _ but also
said he had opposed its initial removal.
	   ``We will not look very good if we stand before the world as a
system that takes down monuments, then restores them, then takes
them down again and restores them again,'' he was quoted by the
Interfax news agency as saying.
	   The towering bronze statue of ``Iron Felix,'' head of the first
secret police organization in the Soviet era, was a major Moscow
landmark for decades.
	   In one of the most enduring images of the defeated hard-line
coup against Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev in August 1991,
five giant cranes pulled down the 14-ton statue. Thousands of
onlookers cheered and clambered over the prone monument, denouncing
the KGB's role in decades of repression.
	   The statue has since languished with other Soviet-era statues in
a city park.
	   Lyubyanka Square is now used by human rights groups for vigils
to honor the millions of victims of Soviet rule. Relatives of
victims of Soviet-era purges whose remains were never found use the
square as a symbolic gravesite, bringing flowers every year.
	   President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said Friday
that the president didn't take the parliament's decision seriously
as a legal document. But ``on an emotional level it is difficult to
expect a person who spearheaded democratic reforms to support a
monument'' that for many people symbolizes political repression,
Yakushkin said.
	   Grigory Yavlinsky, head of the liberal Yabloko faction, said
Friday: ``It's now clear that all Communist talk about being a new,
reformed party is a cynical lie.''
	   ``If they come to power in Russia, they would use the same
methods this man (Dzerzhinsky) used _ physical extermination of
their opponents. Their ideal of justice is summary executions in
the basements.''
	   Yabloko members also proposed an end to the state financing of
Vladimir Lenin's embalmed body and his mausoleum on Red Square. The
motion was overwhelmingly defeated.

Army says it killed 250 rebels in northern Rwanda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ The Rwandan army has killed more than 250
Hutu rebels during recent fighting in the northwest of the country,
the private Rwanda News Agency reported Friday.
	   Citing military sources, the agency said at least two rebel
battalions, made up of as many as 1,200 men, had been cornered near
the Gishwati Forest where fighting took place between Nov. 16 and
27.
	   The rebels are former Hutu soldiers and militiamen responsible
for the 1994 genocide of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and
politically moderate Hutus. The killing ended when Tutsi-led rebels
won power in July 1994, sending thousands of defeated soldiers to
the neighboring former Zaire.
	   Many still have bases in what is now called Congo, from where
they have been launching cross-border attacks.
	   Since August, more than 650,000 people, mostly Hutus, have fled
their homes in northwestern Rwanda to seek protection from the army
in 19 makeshift camps. Rebel extortion, harassment and killings of
both Tutsis and Hutus who refuse them food, money or shelter have
increasingly turned the population against the insurgents.

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Despite promises of a cease-fire,
Congolese government troops and their Zimbabwean allies used
artillery, tanks and aircraft to attack rebel positions in
southeastern Congo, the rebel leader said Friday.
	   But Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, speaking from the Ugandan capital,
said the rebels held ground after fighting Thursday and early
Friday in Kabalo, 300 kilometers (185 miles) southwest of the
eastern rebel stronghold at Goma.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the report. Last week,
rebel troops and their Rwandan allies faced Zimbabwean soldiers
across the Nzofu Bridge over the Congo River, which guarded the
entrance to Kabalo 14 kilometers (8 miles) away.
	   Zimbabwe, along with Angola, Namibia and Chad have sent troops
and equipment to back the forces of Congolese President Laurent
Kabila after Rwandan and Ugandan-backed Congolese rebels took up
arms Aug. 2 to topple him.
	   At a summit in Paris last week, leaders of Rwanda, Uganda,
Zimbabwe and Congo had pledged to work toward a cease-fire, but
failed to agree on concrete proposals.
	   Wamba, who on Saturday will discuss Congo with Ugandan President
Yoweri Museveni, said peace talks to discuss ceasefire proposals in
Lusaka, Zambia Dec. 9 had been postponed to a later date. He said
his rebel Congolese Democratic Coalition had not received an
invitation yet, but hoped to participate.
	   So far, Congolese President Laurent Kabila has refused to
negotiate directly with the rebel coalition of ethnic Tutsis,
disaffected soldiers and opposition politicians, instead demanding
that Rwanda and Uganda withdraw their support for the insurgents.
	   Both countries say they will stay on as long as Congo remains
unstable.
	   ``An intention for a need to move toward a cease-fire was just
an intention, now that we know that Kabila and Zimbabwe have
attacked Kabalo with a full force,'' Wamba said.

Three dead after man kills ex-wife, friend, commits suicide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EISENSTADT, Austria (AP) _ A 50-year-old gas station owner
fatally shot his ex-wife and her male friend Friday before turning
the pistol on himself in a village near here, police said.
	   Police said the assailant, who was not identified, walked into a
tavern where his former wife worked, pulled out a .44-caliber
pistol and shot a 30-year-old man repeatedly. The victim died later
in hospital.
	   The ex-wife ran outside for help, but her former husband pursued
her into the street, police said. She was pronounced dead at the
scene. The assailant then shot himself dead.
	   Police said the couple had been divorced for about three months.
	   The incident occurred in the village of Mitterpullendorf about
15 kilometers (9 miles) west of the Hungarian border and 40
kilometers (25 miles) south of here.

Russian ruble tumbles, Primakov warns of `permanent' crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS, LEADS with 10 grafs to include additional
Primakov comments, background on crisis. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The sinking ruble headed toward its lowest level
since a financial meltdown this summer, and Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov warned Friday that the country's reforms were imperiled by
the shrinking economy.
	   Primakov's government desperately wants to stabilize the economy
as Russia heads into the difficult winter months. But with
President Boris Yeltsin hospitalized and Primakov struggling to
implement a recovery plan, the economy is still foundering and
susceptible to additional shocks.
	   ``If there is no social and economic stability in Russia ...
then any (further) reforms are out of the question,'' Primakov told
a session of the the World Economic Forum, a Swiss-based
organization.
	   Primakov stressed that the government was still committed to
market reforms, and noted that it had not intervened to fix the
ruble rate or restrict the flow of dollars, as some had suggested.
	   But he acknowledged that the loss of confidence in the economy
had given the government little room to maneuver.
	   ``In such conditions, the crisis can become permanent,'' he
said. ``But the worst consequences of the crisis aren't the fall of
the ruble, or the drop in production, but a total crisis of
confidence between creditors and debtors, owners and managers, the
government and the population.''
	   Russia is urgently seeking foreign help, but International
Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus came and left this week
without giving any signal that a frozen loan package will be
released soon.
	   Until the IMF acts, other foreign lenders are unlikely to give
Russia the infusion of cash it needs to pay workers, pensioners and
foreign creditors.
	   The country's financial markets have effectively been wiped out
by the economic crisis, which hit Russia in August after first
ravaging many Asian economies last year.
	   In this environment, the ruble is one of the leading indicators
of economic confidence, and it is again on the decline. Many blame
its fall on concerns that the government is printing money to pay
huge wage debts _ a move almost certain to push up inflation.
	   After stabilizing for a few weeks at about 16 to the dollar, the
ruble has been falling in recent days. The official rate was down
from 18.8 on Thursday to 19.6 on Friday, and in street trading it
took more than 20 rubles to purchase one U.S. dollar.
	   The ruble dipped below 20 to the dollar shortly after the
country's economic crisis hit in August before making a modest
comeback. The ruble was at about 6 to the dollar before the crisis.
	   Meanwhile, the government announced that inflation is up more
than 65 percent so far this year and is expected to top 70 percent
by year's end.
	   Russian inflation had been coming down after years of soaring
prices and was expected to be in single digits this year until the
country's economic crisis hit.
	   If the government does not receive foreign assistance soon, it
has said it would print more rubles to pay off millions of workers
who haven't received their money for months.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more details, Hoss quote

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Prime Minister-Designate Salim Hoss
appointed a Cabinet on Friday of many fresh faces and without five
civil-war militia figures who had held power previously.
	   ``This government will inspire great confidence and reassure
people. It augurs well,'' Hoss told reporters after presenting his
team to President Emile Lahoud.
	   In a first step toward his goal of austerity, Hoss formed a
government of only 16 ministers, nearly half the 30-member Cabinet
of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
	   Hoss, a U.S.-educated economist whom Lahoud designated premier
earlier this week, appointed himself as foreign minister and also
took the portfolio of immigrant affairs.
	   He chose Nasser Saidi, a vice-governor of the central bank, as
minister of economy and trade as well as minister of industry.
	   The prime minister retained only two members of Hariri's
government: Michel Murr, who remains deputy prime minister and
interior minister and takes on rural and municipal affairs as well,
and Suleiman Franjieh, who was appointed minister of agriculture
and minister of housing and cooperatives.
	   Franjieh was a Christian militia leader during the 1975-90 civil
war.
	   Other leading militiamen were dropped from the Cabinet. They
were Druze leader Walid Jumblatt and ally Akram Chehayab, Christian
militia leader Elie Hobeika, and senior Shiite Muslim Amal
officials Mahmoud Abu Hamdan and Ayyoub Hmeid.
	   The defense portfolio went to Ghazi Zuetir, a legislator from
the eastern Bekaa Valley.
	   Hoss appointed a number of specialists to what is the fifth
government he has formed.
	   The new health minister is the head of the Gynecology and
Nursery Department at American University of Beirut, Karam Karam.
	   Judge Joseph Shaoul was appointed justice minister.
	   Another judge, Suleiman Traboulsi, was named as oil minister and
will also take on the ministry of water and hydraulic resources.
	   The Cabinet respects Lebanon's traditional power-sharing
arrangement, which divides seats equally between Christians and
Muslims.

Norway plans six more months of oil production cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway, the world's second largest oil
exporter, plans to extend its voluntary oil production cuts through
June 30 in a bid to counter a global supply glut and boost prices,
the oil minister said Friday.
	   Norway is not a member of OPEC, but in May cut oil production by
about three percent until the end of this year to help the oil
cartel is a drive to reduce supplies and boost prices.
	   Norwegian Oil Minister Marit Arnstad said the government wants
to continue its cuts, even though an OPEC meeting in Vienna last
week ended without an agreement on bigger cuts. OPEC ministers will
meet again in March.
	   ``A continuation of Norwegian production regulation in the
current market situation is important,'' Arnstad said. ``Ending the
measures now could complicate or prevent further efforts being made
by other producers.''
	   The Norwegian government estimated average daily oil production
of 3.4 million barrels per day from its offshore fields. Arnstad
said the cuts in production would be about 100,000 barrels per day.

Russia's strategic forces to receive new nuclear missiles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's strategic missile forces will be equipped
with 10 new Topol-M ballistic nuclear missiles before the end of
the year, a senior official said Friday.
	   ``Literally today or tomorrow, the last missile manufactured
this year goes to the location site,'' First Deputy Prime Minister
Yuri Maslyukov told the staff of Moscow's Heat Engineering
Institute.
	   The Topol-M is the first new ballistic nuclear missile to be
deployed by Russia in several years and is intended to form the
country's main nuclear deterrent. It is a relatively small, rugged
missile designed to be fired from trucks or other vehicles, making
it difficult for potential enemies to succeed with a first strike
in a nuclear confrontation.
	   The missile force has been struggling to maintain its
effectiveness at a time when the military lacks funds and equipment
because of the country's economic crisis. The force's older
missiles are wearing out rapidly and only a few Topols have been
built as replacements.
	   Defense spending will equal 3.5 percent of gross domestic
product in 1999, Maslyukov was quoted by the ITAR-Tass news agency
as saying. He added that once the economic crisis abates, Russia
may be able to start manufacturing about 40 Topol missiles each
year. So far, the crisis has shown no sign of ending.
	   Russian military commanders have devoted much of their limited
funding to maintaining the nuclear forces, one of the few factors
that boosts Moscow's claim to be a global power. The government
insists more money must be found to modernize the nuclear forces
despite the economic crisis.
	   Maslyukov said Russia needs to get rid of huge stockpiles of
aging or outdated weapons _ and therefore should ratify the START
II arms reduction treaty with the United States.
	   ``We have nearly 6,000 warheads, but in the face of powerful
countermeasures, only hundreds of them will hit enemy targets. In
this light, ratification is a way to reduce the surplus, to
concentrate what little resources we have on the most important
projects,'' Maslyukov said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   START II, which was signed in 1993, would halve Russian and
American nuclear arsenals to about 3,500 warheads each. The U.S.
Senate ratified it in 1996, but the Communist-led opposition in the
Russian parliament has balked.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's cash-strapped missile forces have designed a
cheap method for getting rid of old nuclear missiles _ by launching
them.
	   The Scalpel missiles would be launched without nuclear warheads,
and their trajectory would be calculated so that they use up all
their fuel and then burn in the atmosphere, missile force press
service said, according to Interfax.
	   However, the service life of the missiles has expired, and
engineers are no longer sure whether the missiles will accurately
follow their programmed trajectory.
	   Storing the missiles is dangerous and expensive, the missile
force said.

Noah beats Cash, helped by drink of champagne
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Revived by a sip of a spectator's champagne,
Yannick Noah survived a match point on the way to a 6-7 (8-6), 7-6
(8-6), 10-8 victory over Pat Cash in the ATP Seniors tournament at
Olympia Friday.
	   A set down and at 3-3 in the second, Noah raced towards a ball
he failed to reach and jumped in among the spectators. He picked up
a glass of champagne belonging to a blonde woman and had a drink
before continuing the match.
	   ``That really did me good'' he said later.
	   A backhand from Cash clipped the net and gave the Australian
match point at 6-5 but Noah saved it with a service winner.
	   He won the set and the match went into a tiebreak third set of a
minumum 10 points.
	   At 8-8, Cash served, came to the net and wrong-footed Noah with
a backhand volley. It looked a certain winner, but Noah recovered,
slid across the court and from the baseline hit a forehand down the
line past the startled Australian.
	   That gave Noah match point, and he clinched the match on his own
serve.
	   The result gave Noah his second victory after Thursday's triumph
over fellow Frenchman Guy Forget and he will clinch a place in
Sunday's final if he beats Britain's John Lloyd on Saturday.

U.N. rights panel criticizes Israeli treatment of non-Jews
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Non-Jews in Israel are treated as second-class
citizens, a U.N. rights panel said Friday, asserting the emphasis
on being a Jewish state ``encourages discrimination.''
	   The panel was particularly critical of the plight of the
Jahalin, a Bedouin tribe it says were forcibly evicted from their
ancestral lands to expand a Jewish settlement near Jerusalem.
	   ``The committee deplores the manner in which the government of
Israel has housed these families in a garbage dump in Abu Dis under
sub-human living conditions,'' the U.N. panel said.
	   The U.N. committee of 18 independent experts meets annually to
review whether countries in the 137-nation International Covenant
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights have assured an adequate
standard of living for their citizens.
	   In its review of Israel, the panel expressed ``concern that the
government ... does not accord equal rights to its Arab citizens.''
	   ``This discriminatory attitude is apparent in the comparatively
lower standard of living of the Israeli Arabs,'' the panel said,
adding that the country's emphasis on being a Jewish state
``encourages discrimination and accords a second-class status to
its non-Jewish citizens.''
	   Israeli officials said the government had made ``tangible and
costly progress'' in combating inequality and that the campaign
would continue. But they conceded that sometimes Palestinians
suffer economically because of security clampdowns necessary to
fight terrorism.
	   In a list of 15 recommendations and suggestions, the committee
called for equal treatment of all Israeli citizens, respect for the
right to self-determination and recognition of the rights of Arab
Bedouin villages to basic services, including water.
	   The committee also criticized Canada for permitting poverty and
homelessness, and for the conditions in which its native population
lives.
	   In reviewing the situations in Switzerland, Germany and Cyprus,
it noted the problems facing women and the high level of domestic
violence.

Prime minister-designate names Cabinet team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details on finance minister graf 5; ADDS byline;
no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Prime Minister-Designate Salim Hoss
appointed a Cabinet on Friday of many fresh faces and without five
civil-war militia figures who had held power previously.
	   ``This government will inspire great confidence and reassure
people. It augurs well,'' Hoss told reporters after presenting his
team to President Emile Lahoud.
	   In a first step toward his goal of austerity, Hoss formed a
government of only 16 ministers, nearly half the 30-member Cabinet
of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
	   Hoss, a U.S.-educated economist whom Lahoud designated premier
earlier this week, appointed himself as foreign minister and also
took the portfolio of immigrant affairs.
	   He chose a businessman and economist, George Korom, as finance
minister and a vice-governor of the central bank, Nasser Saidi, as
minister of economy and trade as well as industry minister.
	   The prime minister retained only two members of Hariri's
government: Michel Murr, who remains deputy prime minister and
interior minister and takes on rural and municipal affairs as well,
and Suleiman Franjieh, who was appointed minister of agriculture
and minister of housing and cooperatives.
	   Franjieh was a Christian militia leader during the 1975-90 civil
war.
	   Other leading militiamen were dropped from the Cabinet. They
were Druze leader Walid Jumblatt and ally Akram Chehayab, Christian
militia leader Elie Hobeika, and senior Shiite Muslim Amal
officials Mahmoud Abu Hamdan and Ayyoub Hmeid.
	   The defense portfolio went to Ghazi Zuetir, a legislator from
the eastern Bekaa Valley.
	   Hoss appointed a number of specialists to what is the fifth
government he has formed since he first served as prime minister in
1976.
	   The new health minister is the head of the Gynecology and
Nursery Department at American University of Beirut, Karam Karam.
	   Judge Joseph Shaoul was appointed justice minister.
	   Another judge, Suleiman Traboulsi, was named as oil minister and
will also take on the ministry of water and hydraulic resources.
	   The Cabinet respects Lebanon's traditional power-sharing
arrangement, which divides seats equally between Christians and
Muslims.
	   Hoss said the Cabinet would hold its first meeting on Saturday.
	   Ministers are expected to draw up a policy statement that will
be put to parliament when Hoss asks for a vote of confidence.
	   The new team is almost certain to win the vote, and so take
office, as 95 legislators told the president this week that they
would support a government led by Hoss.

Kosovo rebels reject political compromise; new shootouts erupt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with rebels rejecting interim status, new
border shootings; No pickup &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo rebels refused Friday to
accept anything short of complete independence, rejecting a
U.S.-proposed settlement as new border shootings put dangerous
strains on the province's fragile peace.
	   Escalating violence in Kosovo, including a shootout Friday that
killed a woman in the province's second-largest city, has lent new
urgency to American-led efforts to get Serbs and ethnic Albanians
to agree on a plan for Kosovo's future. Thirteen ethnic Albanians
have been reported killed this week.
	   But the Kosovo Liberation Army dealt diplomacy a setback by
declaring it would not accept any peace deal short of independence
_ dismissing recent signals that it was ready to support a U.S.
proposal.
	   The ethnic Albanian guerrillas said in a statement distributed
in Pristina that they would not accept any political solution
``which would harm the ideals of our people toward independence, or
which would cement, even temporarily, an imposed joint life in an
anti-Albanian, anti-democratic'' system.
	   A KLA political representative signaled last week the rebels
were ready to postpone complete independence, but the KLA said on
Friday it was ``undeterred'' in its fight for an independent state.
	   The rebels said they issue a detailed response later to a
revised American-backed plan, which was distributed to the Serb and
ethnic Albanian sides this week. It calls for an interim political
status for Kosovo.
	   Dozens of people have died in sporadic clashes since an Oct.
12-brokered peace agreement brought a halt to seven months of
fighting in the secessionist province, which is overwhelmingly
ethnic Albanian.
	   Ethnic Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova renewed his call
for international military intervention in the wake of the latest
violence.
	   ``NATO ground troop deployment would provide a greater sense of
security,'' he said at a news conference.
	   A reported clash Friday in the western town of Pec raised the
death toll from the last three days alone to 13 _ all ethnic
Albanians.
	   The Serb-run Media Center said six people also were wounded in a
shootout that erupted after a man and woman attacked a Serb
policeman guarding Pec's hospital. The two reportedly shot and
wounded the policeman, who then fired his automatic rifle and also
injured five bystanders.
	   The Serb center said the female attacker was killed by other
guards while her partner escaped.
	   In another reported incident, Yugoslav border guards reportedly
shot at 10 ethnic Albanians who tried to cross illegally into
Yugoslavia from Albania and allegedly fired at the guards first.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is assembling a force of 2,000 unarmed international verifiers in
Kosovo, declined to single out Serb forces or Kosovo rebels for the
rising violence.
	   The OSCE mission, still being set up, will try to verify
Yugoslavia's adherence to agreements Belgrade reached with U.S.
envoys and the OSCE to halt violence in Kosovo and start political
negotiations.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and up to 300,000 were left
homeless after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a
crackdown in February against rebels who demand independence for
Kosovo.

3 die in explosion at Russian army depot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ At least one explosion rocked an army storage
depot in Russia's Ural Mountains on Friday, killing three men, news
reports said.
	   Another man was injured but rejected medical aid and fled, Lt.
Gen. Vyacheslav Tikhomirov, chief of staff for the Urals military
district, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying. Police
were searching for the man.
	   One of the dead was a retired colonel and the other two were
civilians who worked as guards at the depot in Yekaterinburg, about
1,500 kilometers (900 miles) east of Moscow.
	   The cause of the explosion was unclear. Earlier reports said
several blasts ripped through a repair shop at the depot that
contained bags of gunpowder.

 &UR; Anti-Milosevic politicians meet EU leaders, call for change &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Prospects for peace in Kosovo and
progress in the rest of Yugoslavia are dim as long as President
Slobodan Milosevic remains in power, opposition politicians said
Friday.
	   ``We must make it clear to the people that such a bad government
as we have now has not served the (Yugoslav) people,'' Zoran
Djindjic, a former Belgrade mayor, told reporters.
	   Djindjic made his remarks following a meeting of Serb opposition
figures and Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel, whose
government currently holds the European Union presidency.
	   Schuessel said the EU wanted better relations with Belgrade but
added that Milosevic was ``part of the problem and not the
solution.'' His comments were similar to those made this week in
Washington by State Department spokesman James Rubin, who claimed
Milosevic's hold on power was weakening.
	   About 10 Serbian opposition groups have formed an Alliance for
Change to oppose Milosevic.
	   Opposition groups mounted large public protests against
Milosevic two years ago, but their movement fell apart over
personal differences among the leadership.
	   This time, Djindjic said, ``we must understand that this is not
only about political power and offices but a complete change'' for
the country.
	   During the press conference, former Yugoslav Prime Minister
Milan Panic also said that the opposition must convince the
Yugoslav public that ``a better government will bring a better
life.''
	   Panic also said that a genuine peace in the troubled Kosovo
province could come about only as part of a general democratization
of Yugoslav politics. Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are
fighting for independence, is part of Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia.

Former coup leader leads in Venezuelan presidential polls
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Venezuela-Election &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ A former coup leader holds a
comfortable lead going into Venezuela's presidential elections
despite a last-ditch effort by two major parties to close ranks
around his main opponent, two polls showed Friday.
	   ``An earthquake would have to occur'' for Hugo Chavez to lose
Sunday's race, Saul Cabrera, director of the Consultores 21 polling
firm, told foreign reporters.
	   A tracking poll taken over the past four days indicated Chavez
had 57 percent of the vote compared to 34 percent for his closest
rival, Yale-educated businessman Henrique Salas Romer, he said. The
survey of 1,200 likely voters in nine cities had a margin of error
of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
	   Over the past week, the center-left Democratic Action Party and
the center-right COPEI Party dumped their respective candidates and
threw their support behind Salas in an effort to head off a victory
by Chavez, who many Venezuelans fear will impose a dictatorship if
elected.
	   Chavez led an unsuccessful coup attempt in 1992.
	   Another poll by the Datanalisis firm gave Chavez 53 percent of
the vote compared to 37 percent for Salas. The Dec. 1-2 survey of
1,000 potential voters had a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percentage points.
	   In both polls, the remaining support went to other trailing
candidates, including former Miss Universe Irene Saez.
	   Venezuelan law prohibits the publishing of opinion polls during
the week preceding the election, but the directors of Datanalisis
and Consultores 21 shared their latest figures with the
international media.

Turkish labor and trade groups back an Ecevit-led government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with military purging Islamic
officers, others &QL; 
 &UR; By SUZAN FRASER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The party of former Premier Tansu Ciller
refused Friday to join any coalition that includes a bitter,
center-right rival, dimming Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit's
chances of forming a majority government that shuts out the
nation's Islamic party.
	   Meanwhile, Turkey's all-powerful military reportedly sacked 86
officers _ some apparently for their Islamic ties.
	   Ecevit is a veteran politician of the left, and, like the
military in this predominantly Islamic nation, staunchly
pro-secular. He was asked this week to form a government to replace
the 17-month-old one that collapsed when Premier Mesut Yilmaz lost
a confidence vote last month.
	   Ecevit has made clear that he would refuse to turn to
parliament's largest party, the pro-Islamic Virtue party, for a
majority.
	   Virtue's predecessor, the pro-Islamic Welfare party, was
pressured by the military last year into resigning.
	   But if Mrs. Ciller sticks to her refusal to join the three-party
team proposed by Ecevit, virtually the only government that could
be formed without the Islamic forces would be a minority coalition
with outside support in parliament from the center-right.
	   That was the same formula used by Yilmaz to avoid governing with
Mrs. Ciller, his rival.
	   Her True Path party decided after a meeting Friday to reject any
proposal that would put it in the same coalition with Yilmaz.
	   ``That would mean the revival of a government that was just
toppled because of irregularities in state contracts, corruption
and links to gangs,'' said Mrs. Ciller's close aide, Hasan Ekinci,
referring to allegations about the Yilmaz coalition.
	   ``We tried a coalition before and everyone knows how that
ended,'' he said referring to a three-month alliance in 1996 that
collapsed when Yilmaz backed corruption probes against Mrs. Ciller.
	   Ecevit is scheduled to meet with Yilmaz on Saturday and Mrs.
Ciller on Monday.
	   On Friday, Yilmaz, now caretaker premier, met with top army
brass to reportedly discuss the cases of some 50 officers suspected
of ties to radical Islam.
	   After the meeting, private Kanal D television said 86 officers
were sacked. The station said only that the officers were purged
for disciplinary reasons.
	   The military, which has asserted itself as the guarantor of
Turkey's secular traditions, has sacked hundreds of officers in the
last two years to try to rid the ranks of alleged militant Islamic
tendencies.
	   Turkey's five largest labor and trade confederations are
pressing political leaders to back Ecevit's efforts to form a new,
pro-secular government.
	   ``The country needs political and economic stability today more
than ever,'' said a confederation leader Dervis Gunday.

Former prime minister detained on money laundering charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Swiss authorities Friday charged Pavlo Lazarenko,
former prime minister of the Ukraine, with money laundering.
	   Investigating judge Laurent Kasper-Ansermet said Lazarenko,
being held in Geneva, was charged with offenses committed while he
was head of the Ukrainian government.
	   It is alleged that he acted to cover up the truth about dirty
money held in Switzerland and prevented its confiscation.
	   Kasper-Ansermet added that a ``relatively large'' sum of money
had been seized in Geneva and that he would be asking for Lazarenko
to be held in prison until his trial.
	   The Swiss government says it has received 20 separate requests
from Ukraine since February for help in its investigation of
Lazarenko. Investigations are underway in Zurich and Fribourg as
well as Geneva.
	   Last month the federal police announced that Switzerland was
helping Ukrainian authorities track down money Lazarenko allegedly
stashed in Swiss banks. Switzerland has handed over some bank
documents to Ukraine.
	   Kasper-Ansermet said the charges against Lazarenko which have
led to his detention related to an inquiry by Geneva officials and
were not linked to proceedings which have been opened in Kiev.
	   Lazarenko, who was arrested Wednesday as he crossed from France
into Switzerland, will be held initially for eight days, but at a
hearing next week the investigating judge will ask for this to be
extended by another three months.
	   Lazarenko was prime minister in 1996-97, and he was fired by
President Leonid Kuchma for alleged corruption. He now leads the
centrist opposition Hromoda party.
	   His lawyer told the daily Le Temps newspaper Friday that
Lazarenko's opponents were trying to discredit him before the
presidential elections next year.

Former secret police agent sentenced to 12 years for embezzlement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A former spy for the feared Communist
secret police was sentenced to 12 years in prison Friday for
embezzling more than dlrs 200,000 from a bank account, a news
agency reported.
	   In the 1980s, Nicolae Nadejde, a colonel in the dreaded
Securitate, was asked to manage a company in Bucharest run by a
Panamanian national, the private news agency Mediafax reported. The
company's name and business were not disclosed.
	   In his six years as manager, Nadejde illegally diverted dlrs
230,000, the court ruled.
	   The Securitate of former dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was very
active in foreign trade. Ceausescu was overthrown and executed in
Dec. 1989.
	   In 1986, the company was closed down and Nadejde's activity
ceased with the Securitate. No more details were available.
	   Nadejde claimed that the money remained in a bank account at a
branch of France's Societe Generale and his bosses tried to
withdraw money falsifying their signatures, but were stopped by
bank officials.
	   In 1993, Nadejde claimed the owner of the company in Panama
asked him to liquidate the company and give him the money, which he
says he did. Military prosecutors claim Nadejde took all the money.
	   The company owner did not appear at the trial.
	   The trial, considered sensitive, was held behind closed doors at
Bucharest's military court.

Belarusian president reshuffles government

	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ President Alexander Lukashenko has
unexpectedly merged three of his government ministries under one
roof and appointed his adviser to head them, the presidential press
service said Friday.
	   Lukashenko ordered that the Foreign Economic Ministry and the
ministry for relations with former Soviet republics be incorporated
into the Foreign Ministry, Belarusian state television reported,
citing presidential press service.
	   The heads of the three ministries have been fired. Lukashenko
appointed his foreign policy adviser and ex-KGB officer Ural
Latypov to head the expanded Foreign Ministry.
	   Lukashenko, an eccentric and authoritarian leader, gave no
reason for what his decree called a ``reorganization'' of the
government.

Fiji avenge defeat to win Dubai title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: fixes final score to 29-22, changes made by referees &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ World champion Fiji avenged
its defeat here last year, beating title holder New Zealand 29-22
to land the Emirates International Trophy in a thrilling final
Friday night.
	   The Fijians, who were narrowly beaten by the All Blacks in the
recent Commonwealth Games final in Kuala Lumpur, ran in five tries
to four, with scrum half Rokini Kiliraki sealing victories with two
conversions.
	   Kiliraki, named Player of the Tournament, set up many moves and
helped the Fijians keep up the pressure throughout the final, with
some judicious passing and swerves.
	   ``We were determined to make up for our performance in Dubai
last year and we did just that,'' Fiji manager Jone Buakula said
after picking up the dlrs 25,000 first prize.
	   ``This is a wonderful moment for us,'' he added. ``I am very
proud of the team for the spirit they have showed and want to thank
all the fans for their great support over the last two days.''
	   New Zealand took the lead in the final when the powerful Brad
Fleming went over for the first of his two tries from an overlap.
But the Fijians grabbed the lead through a converted try by Jope
Tuikabe.
	   Sirilo Lala then increased the advantage. But the New Zealanders
were on level terms at half-time, when skipper Dallas Seymour
passed to Fleming who touched down under the posts, presenting an
easy conversion for Damien Karuana.
	   The irrepressible Marika Vunibaka pulled Fiji ahead immediately
after the break using his pace and build to power over 70 meters,
and Kiliraki added the extra points for a 19-12 lead.
	   Amasio Valence gave New Zealand a lifeline when he muscled over
for a try after Fleming had made the initial run along the left
side. Karuana failed with the conversion.
	   Fiji then took control of the game through quick tries by
Kiliraki and Lala as the New Zealanders committed handling errors,
though skipper Dallas Seymour scored the final try of the match for
the All Blacks.
	   ``Fiji maintained pressure on us and the better team won
today,'' said New Zealand manager Ross Thurston. ``But we will meet
again soon.''
	   France won the Emirates Plate event, drubbing South African side
Natal 40-7 in the final to make up for its earlier elimination from
the main event.
	   Fiji and New Zealand had contrasting paths to the final, with
Western Samoa stretching the reigning world sevens champions before
going down 29-21 in a stirring semifinal that brought out the best
in both sides.
	   The Samoans, who came from behind to beat Scotland in the
quarters, took the fight to the Fijians, but left their charge too
late after being 22-0 down at the first half.
	   Marika Vunibaka, last year's Player of the Tournament, displayed
his punishing speed to ground two tries while scrum half Rokini
Kiliraki, Sirilo Lala and Vilomoni Deasau scored one apiece.
	   Orene Ai'i almost saw Samoa through to a remarkable victory with
his pace, upsetting the fine rhythm of the Fijians. But despite a
try from him and one each from Afato Sp'oalo and Saito Sililito - a
stunning effort after a raking run by Ai'i - the Samoans were
unable to catch up with the Fijians, who used their typically
aggressive tackling to stop their rivals.
	   New Zealand made use of their superior sevens skills to oust
Australia 29-0, with young star Rico Gear planting two tries,
covering a distance of over 60 meters to score the second try,
after Australian Stephen Devine's move towards the New Zealand try
line was foiled.
	   The Australians had their chances, but messed up meters in front
of the Kiwi try line and had no answer when their opponents began
to run the ball from wing to wing.
	   Brad Fleming, one of the lynchpins of the Kiwi campaign here,
scored the first try while Craig de Goldie and Rua Tipoki planted
one apiece.
	   Fiji overcame gutsy Canada 35-12 in the quarters while New
Zealand overwhelmed Zimbabwe 45-5, though the African side had the
distinction of being the first team to breach the defense of the
reigning Dubai champions this year.

Noah beats Cash, helped by drink of champagne
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Forget beating Lloyd &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Revived by a sip of a spectator's champagne,
Yannick Noah survived a match point on the way to a 6-7 (8-6), 7-6
(8-6), 10-8 victory over Pat Cash in the ATP Seniors tournament at
Olympia Friday.
	   A set down and at 3-3 in the second, Noah raced towards a ball
he failed to reach and jumped in among the spectators. He picked up
a glass of champagne belonging to a blonde woman and had a drink
before continuing the match.
	   ``That really did me good'' he said later.
	   A backhand from Cash clipped the net and gave the Australian
match point at 6-5 but Noah saved it with a service winner.
	   He won the set and the match went into a tiebreak third set of a
minumum 10 points.
	   At 8-8, Cash served, came to the net and wrong-footed Noah with
a backhand volley. It looked a certain winner, but Noah recovered,
slid across the court and from the baseline hit a forehand down the
line past the startled Australian.
	   That gave Noah match point, and he clinched the match on his own
serve.
	   The result gave Noah his second victory after Thursday's triumph
over fellow Frenchman Guy Forget and he will clinch a place in
Sunday's final if he beats Britain's John Lloyd on Saturday.
	   Forget scored a 6-3, 6-4 victory over Lloyd and has an outside
chance of gaining the final if he beats Cash on Saturday and Noah
loses to Lloyd.

Gaudenzi retires in fifth set to give Sweden 1-0 lead

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Defending champion Sweden took a 1-0 lead
over Italy in the Davis Cup final Friday when Italy's Andrea
Gaudenzi, troubled by a sore shoulder, retired with the score 6-6
in the fifth set of a nearly five-hour marathon against Magnus
Norman..
	   Italy's No. 1 player, who had rallied from a 0-4 deficit in the
decisive set, strained his already sore shoulder as he hit an ace
to take a 6-5 lead and seemed headed toward a dream victory in
front of a sold-out partisan crowd.
	   Italian fans, who had racuosly supported Gaudenzi's comeback
attempt, looked stunned as the 25-year-old tossed his racket in
despair and gave up to the younger Swede with the tally 6-7 (9-11),
7-6 (7-0), 4-6, 6-3, 6-6.
	   Sweden's No.1 player Magnus Gustafsson was to face Davide
Sanguinetti in the second singles of the day.
	   Norman, at No. 52, was the lowest-ranked among singles players
in the final and a late replacement for injured teammate Thomas
Johansson.
	   Norman had wasted a match point in the 10th game and appeared
exhausted when the first singles of the best-of-5 series came to a
halt on the slow clay indoors at the Assago Forum just outside
Milan.
	   Gaudenzi had not played a match since Italy's surprising 4-1
defeat of the United States in the semifinals in September.
	   The former world junior No. 1 had surgery on the right shoulder
in October, and his fitness was a question mark heading into this
final.

Responding to crisis, Russia delivers food, fuel to needy areas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with regional population figures in new 6th graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia launched operations Friday to bring food
and fuel to needy outposts in the far northeast, where the
country's economic crisis has made a hard life even harder for many
people.
	   More than 30 tons of food were delivered to three places in the
Chukotka Peninsula, including Wrangel Island, where three
filmmakers were airlifted to safety earlier in the week after they
ran out of food.
	   Villagers on the island have also been running low on supplies,
and a helicopter brought one ton of vegetables to the village of
Ushakovsky as part of a larger arctic airlift, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   A fuel tanker left the southeastern port of Nakhodka with more
than 15,000 tons of fuel that it was taking to two ports on the
Chukotka Peninsula, one of many places in the northeast where fuel
supplies have become critically low as a result of the economic
crisis.
	   ITAR-Tass said the tanker Samotlor is expected to reach the
ports of Egvenkinot and Providence in a week, but will have to wait
for an icebreaker to lead it into port.
	   The entire sprawling Chukotka region, including the surrounding
islands, has about 80,000 people.
	   Meanwhile, in the southeastern territory of Primorsky, officials
announced a program to stockpile food reserves to protect people
from the effects of potentially steep price increases. Inflation is
expected to be over 70 percent this year.
	   In other signs of tough economic times:
	   _ Several hundred teachers in northern city of Arkhangelsk, who
have been on strike since Nov. 12, picketed the mayor's office and
city administration, demanding wages that haven't been paid for up
to five months, ITAR-Tass said.
	   _ Ambulance crews in the Ural Mountains city of Nizhny Tagil
held a two-hour warning strike during which they responded only to
extreme emergencies. They are demanding wages that haven't been
paid for four months.

 &UR; Anti-Milosevic politicians meet EU leaders, call for change &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Prospects for peace in Kosovo and
progress in the rest of Yugoslavia are dim as long as President
Slobodan Milosevic remains in power, opposition politicians said
Friday.
	   ``We must make it clear to the people that such a bad government
as we have now has not served the (Yugoslav) people,'' Zoran
Djindjic, a former Belgrade mayor, told reporters.
	   Djindjic made his remarks following a meeting of Serb opposition
figures and Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel, whose
government currently holds the European Union presidency.
	   Schuessel said the EU wanted better relations with Belgrade but
added that Milosevic was ``part of the problem and not the
solution.'' His comments were similar to those made this week in
Washington by State Department spokesman James Rubin, who claimed
Milosevic's hold on power was weakening.
	   About 10 Serbian opposition groups have formed an Alliance for
Change to oppose Milosevic.
	   Opposition groups mounted large public protests against
Milosevic two years ago, but their movement fell apart over
personal differences among the leadership.
	   This time, Djindjic said, ``we must understand that this is not
only about political power and offices but a complete change'' for
the country.
	   During the press conference, former Yugoslav Prime Minister
Milan Panic also said that the opposition must convince the
Yugoslav public that ``a better government will bring a better
life.''
	   Panic also said that a genuine peace in the troubled Kosovo
province could come about only as part of a general democratization
of Yugoslav politics. Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are
fighting for independence, is part of Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia.

Base destroyed, 70 rebels killed in bombing campaign, ECOMOG says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Nigerian military jets destroyed a
Sierra Leonean rebel base in four days of bombing raids, killing at
least 70 fighters and capturing a swath of rebel-held territory,
military officers said Friday.
	   The attacks which ended Friday on the rebel base near the town
of Gberay, about 75 miles (125 kilometers) north of Sierra Leone's
capital, were launched by the Nigerian-led West African
intervention force called ECOMOG, force spokesman Paul Aghimimen
said.
	   The rebels include remnants of Sierra Leone's junta which was
ousted from the capital by ECOMOG earlier this year. Together with
a traditional Sierra Leonean militia force, ECOMOG troops and
planes continue to support the restored government of President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
	   The junta took power during a bloody May 1997 coup that forced
Kabbah into 10 months of hiding.
	   Aghimimen said the raids resulted in the capture of a 40-mile
(60-kilometer) stretch of road linking the northeast town of Makeni
with the capital, Freetown.
	   No civilians were killed and ECOMOG promised not to launch
attacks against targets where villagers and other non-combatants
are at risk, Aghimimen said.
	   The rebels have been blamed by aid workers and villagers for
thousands of murders, rapes and torture of civilians in an apparent
campaign of revenge for their ouster.

Kosovo rebels bury seven guerrillas killed at border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VELIKA KRUSA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo rebels on Friday buried
seven ethnic Albanian guerrillas shot dead by Yugoslav army guards
the previous day near the border with Albania.
	   The seven, all from the village of Velika Krusa, 75 kilometers
(50 miles) southwest of Pristina, were given a traditional Kosovo
Liberation Army funeral.
	   A local KLA commander who gave his name as Sylemetaj disputed
the official claim that the Albanians were shot after attacking a
border patrol, saying they were ambushed as they returned to their
country.
	   Five of the dead had been identified as students, all from the
Hoti family clan. The body of an eighth killed Albanian remains
unidentified. But the KLA rites were a tacit admission that the
victims were guerrillas.
	   As darkness fell, about 1,500 people gathered for a hurried
ceremony and the funeral. An Albanian flag was raised at half-staff
at the village square and the coffins, draped in red-and-black
Albanian flags, were laid in the ground at the village graveyard.
	   A lineup of two dozen KLA soldiers in camouflage uniforms stood
at attention and three shots were fired in an honorary salute.
Wreaths for the seven from their ``friends from the 124th brigade''
were put by the freshly dug graves.
	   ``We are at a crucial moment in Kosovo's history,'' Sylemetaj
told the gathering. ``Kosovo is calling you, now or never.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo rebels refused Friday to
accept anything short of independence, rejecting a key element of a
U.S.-proposed settlement as new border shootings put dangerous
strains on the province's fragile peace.
	   Escalating violence in Kosovo, including a shootout Friday that
killed a woman in the province's second-largest city, has lent new
urgency to American-led efforts to get Serbs and ethnic Albanians
to agree on a plan for Kosovo's future. Thirteen ethnic Albanians
have been reported killed this week.
	   But the Kosovo Liberation Army dealt diplomacy a setback by
declaring it would not accept any peace deal short of independence
_ dismissing recent signals the rebels were ready to support a U.S.
proposal.
	   The ethnic Albanian guerrillas said in a statement distributed
in Pristina that they won't accept any political solution ``which
would harm the ideals of our people toward independence, or which
would cement, even temporarily, an imposed joint life in an
anti-Albanian, anti-democratic'' system.
	   A KLA political representative signaled last week the rebels
were ready to postpone independence and accept a plan giving ethnic
Albanians greater self-rule. But the KLA said Friday it was
``undeterred'' in its ``just fight until our independent and
democratic state is established.''
	   The rebels said they would publish a detailed response later on
a revised American political plan, which was distributed to the
Serb and ethnic Albanian sides this week. It calls for an interim
political status for Kosovo.
	   A Western diplomat who declined to be named called news of the
KLA's rejection ``discouraging.''
	   Dozens of people have died in sporadic clashes since an Oct.
12-brokered peace agreement brought a halt to over seven months of
combat in the secessionist province, which is populated
overwhelmingly by ethnic Albanians.
	   Ethnic Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova renewed his call
for international military intervention in the wake of the latest
violence.
	   ``NATO ground troop deployment would provide a greater sense of
security,'' he said at a news conference.
	   The flareup in violence this week is ``a sign that we need a
special security force which will protect citizens and stop
violence in Kosovo,'' Rugova said.
	   A reported clash Friday in the western town of Pec raised the
death toll from the last three days alone to 13 _ all ethnic
Albanians.
	   The Serb-run Media Center said six people also were wounded in a
shootout that erupted after a man and woman attacked a Serb
policeman guarding Pec's hospital. The two reportedly shot and
wounded the policeman, then fired his automatic rifle and also
injured five bystanders.
	   The Serb center said the female attacker was killed by other
guards while her partner escaped.
	   In another reported incident, Yugoslav border guards supposedly
shot at 10 ethnic Albanians who tried to cross illegally into
Yugoslavia from Albania and allegedly fired at the guards first.
	   The border shootings, neither of which could be independently
confirmed, came a day after Yugoslav army border guards said they
shot dead eight ethnic Albanians trying to enter Kosovo from
Albania.
	   That was the single worst breach of the informal, two-month-old
cease-fire.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is assembling a force of 2,000 unarmed international verifiers in
Kosovo, declined to single out Serb forces or Kosovo rebels for the
rising violence.
	   ``Both sides are in this conflict are guilty of violating the
cease-fire agreement,'' it said, condemning violence ``from any
quarter.''
	   A KLA commander, however, disputed the army's account of
Thursday's killings, saying the guerrillas were ambushed after
crossing into Kosovo from Albania. The commander, who gave his name
as Sylemetaj, said five of the dead were students and all from a
single family clan, the Hotis.
	   Seven of the victims were given a traditional KLA burial late
Friday in their village of Velika Krusa in southwestern Kosovo.
	   ``We are at a crucial moment in Kosovo's history,'' Sylemetaj
told the gathering of 1,500 people, including an honor guard of two
dozen KLA fighters. ``Kosovo is calling you, now or never.''
	   Hundreds of people were killed and up to 300,000 were left
homeless after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a
crackdown last February against rebels who demand independence for
Kosovo.

Fiji avenge defeat to win Dubai title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: REPEATING to CORRECT style in slug. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ World champion Fiji avenged
its defeat here last year, beating title holder New Zealand 29-22
to land the Emirates International Trophy in a thrilling final
Friday night.
	   The Fijians, who were narrowly beaten by the All Blacks in the
recent Commonwealth Games final in Kuala Lumpur, ran in five tries
to four, with scrum half Rokini Kiliraki sealing victories with two
conversions.
	   Kiliraki, named Player of the Tournament, set up many moves and
helped the Fijians keep up the pressure throughout the final, with
some judicious passing and swerves.
	   ``We were determined to make up for our performance in Dubai
last year and we did just that,'' Fiji manager Jone Buakula said
after picking up the dlrs 25,000 first prize.
	   ``This is a wonderful moment for us,'' he added. ``I am very
proud of the team for the spirit they have showed and want to thank
all the fans for their great support over the last two days.''
	   New Zealand took the lead in the final when the powerful Brad
Fleming went over for the first of his two tries from an overlap.
But the Fijians grabbed the lead through a converted try by Jope
Tuikabe.
	   Sirilo Lala then increased the advantage. But the New Zealanders
were on level terms at half-time, when skipper Dallas Seymour
passed to Fleming who touched down under the posts, presenting an
easy conversion for Damien Karuana.
	   The irrepressible Marika Vunibaka pulled Fiji ahead immediately
after the break using his pace and build to power over 70 meters,
and Kiliraki added the extra points for a 19-12 lead.
	   Amasio Valence gave New Zealand a lifeline when he muscled over
for a try after Fleming had made the initial run along the left
side. Karuana failed with the conversion.
	   Fiji then took control of the game through quick tries by
Kiliraki and Lala as the New Zealanders committed handling errors,
though skipper Dallas Seymour scored the final try of the match for
the All Blacks.
	   ``Fiji maintained pressure on us and the better team won
today,'' said New Zealand manager Ross Thurston. ``But we will meet
again soon.''
	   France won the Emirates Plate event, drubbing South African side
Natal 40-7 in the final to make up for its earlier elimination from
the main event.
	   Fiji and New Zealand had contrasting paths to the final, with
Western Samoa stretching the reigning world sevens champions before
going down 29-21 in a stirring semifinal that brought out the best
in both sides.
	   The Samoans, who came from behind to beat Scotland in the
quarters, took the fight to the Fijians, but left their charge too
late after being 22-0 down at the first half.
	   Marika Vunibaka, last year's Player of the Tournament, displayed
his punishing speed to ground two tries while scrum half Rokini
Kiliraki, Sirilo Lala and Vilomoni Deasau scored one apiece.
	   Orene Ai'i almost saw Samoa through to a remarkable victory with
his pace, upsetting the fine rhythm of the Fijians. But despite a
try from him and one each from Afato Sp'oalo and Saito Sililito - a
stunning effort after a raking run by Ai'i - the Samoans were
unable to catch up with the Fijians, who used their typically
aggressive tackling to stop their rivals.
	   New Zealand made use of their superior sevens skills to oust
Australia 29-0, with young star Rico Gear planting two tries,
covering a distance of over 60 meters to score the second try,
after Australian Stephen Devine's move towards the New Zealand try
line was foiled.
	   The Australians had their chances, but messed up meters in front
of the Kiwi try line and had no answer when their opponents began
to run the ball from wing to wing.
	   Brad Fleming, one of the lynchpins of the Kiwi campaign here,
scored the first try while Craig de Goldie and Rua Tipoki planted
one apiece.
	   Fiji overcame gutsy Canada 35-12 in the quarters while New
Zealand overwhelmed Zimbabwe 45-5, though the African side had the
distinction of being the first team to breach the defense of the
reigning Dubai champions this year.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban army said it
has found hundreds of Iranian-marked land mines in the country's
north, where the militia is locked in an ongoing battle with an
opposition alliance.
	   The official Radio Shariat reported 400 land mines ``bearing
Iranian names'' had been found in Takhar province.
	   The Taliban routinely accuse neighboring Iran of supporting the
anti-Taliban alliance, which controls roughly 10 percent of the
country's north.
	   The alliance is comprised mainly of minority ethnic and
religious groups, including Shiite Muslims, the same Islamic sect
that dominates Iran. The majority of Afghans, like most Taliban
soldiers, are Sunni Muslims.
	   The radio broadcast monitored in Islamabad also called on the
United Nations to censure Iran for its ``blunt interference'' in
Afghan affairs.
	   On Thursday the Taliban's spiritual leader Mullah Mohammed Omar
strongly condemned the use of land mines and asked his opponents to
swear off their use.
	   After two decades of relentless fighting, Afghanistan is one of
the heaviest-mined countries in the world. The beleaguered capital,
Kabul, is littered with more mines and ordnance than any other city
in the world, according to United Nations figures.
	   The Taliban rule about 90 percent of Afghanistan. Most of the
fighting is restricted to the northern provinces, where the
opposition dominates.

George Michael regrets loss of dignity in Los Angeles arrest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Pop star George Michael says his arrest at a
public restroom was not the way he would have chosen to bring his
homosexuality out of the closet.
	   ``Believe me, I'd rather have run up and down Oxford Street
naked saying `I'm gay, I'm gay,' than have it happen the way it
did,'' Michael said in a television interview to be broadcast in
Britain on Saturday.
	   He is grateful, he said, for the public support he received
following his April 7 arrest for lewd conduct at Will Rogers
Memorial Park in Beverly Hills, California.
	   ``I've had a really tough decade. I've lost a partner, I've lost
my mother. I've lost my dignity,'' he told BBC-TV. ``The one thing
I hold onto is my relationship with the public.''
	   He said the deaths of his live-in partner Anselmo Feleppa and
his mother had helped him deal with what happened in California.
	   ``Within a day and a half I saw the funny side of it,'' he said.
	   Michael said he had been drinking before the incident in the
park and that he took a foolish risk.
	   ``There was no-one in the vicinity, but two undercover cops and
a slightly drunk randy pop star. I was not subjecting the public to
full frontal nudity,'' he said.

All highways out of the capital closed due to ice
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The government ordered all five major
highways out of the capital closed Friday after freezing rain
turned roads into sheets of ice, the national news agency reported.
	   Transportation Minister Traian Basescu took the decision after
hours of freezing rain which caused hundreds of collisions as cars
and other vehicles skidded into each other, Rompres reported.
	   Basescu was quoted as saying it was impossible for the roads to
be de-iced due to a large number of cars traveling at a low speed.
	   Traffic in and around the capital was reported at a few
kilometers (miles) per hour. Temperatures hovered around -7 C (19F)
all day in Bucharest.

 &UR; Palestinians say they'll stick to timetable of peace accord &QL;

 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The Palestinians said Friday that
they'll stick to the timetable of the Wye River peace agreement
even if Israel does not.
	   Palestinian Cabinet ministers who met Friday evening were to
prepare for the next step, a mid-December gathering under the
auspices of U.S. President Bill Clinton that is to reaffirm that
the Palestinians no longer seek Israel's destruction.
	   Ahead of Clinton visit, some 2,500 Palestinians jailed by Israel
for anti-Israeli activities prepared to launch a hunger strike to
press for their early release.
	   The hunger strike, to begin Saturday, will be accompanied by
protest marches and commercial strikes, all aimed at sending a
message to Clinton that the Wye River peace agreement cannot
proceed until the dispute over the prisoners has been settled, said
Issa Karakeh, head of the Palestinian Prisoners' Association.
	   ``We want to show him (Clinton) that the prisoner issue is an
important one for the Palestinian people,'' Karakeh said.
	   The criteria for prisoner releases have become a major point of
contention between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
	   The dispute has contributed to the latest crisis which
culminated in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
announcement earlier this week that he was suspending the upcoming
West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu said he would hold up the accord until Arafat dropped
plans to unilaterally declare a state next year and accepted
Israel's criteria for releasing prisoners.
	   Arafat adviser Nabil Abourdeneh demanded Friday that Israel
resume implementation. ``As for the Palestinian Authority, it has
and will continue to implement its part of Wye River agreement,''
he said.
	   On Friday evening, the Palestinian Cabinet and the PLO Executive
Committee were to discuss procedures for convening the Palestine
National Council, the Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, and
various Palestinian groups on Dec. 14.
	   On that day, the PNC and the other groups are to ``reaffirm'' a
letter to Clinton in which Arafat declares that clauses of the PLO
founding charter calling for Israel's destructions are null and
void. The session is being convened as part of the Wye accord.
	   Immediately after the gathering, five percent of the West Bank
are to be transferred from sole Israeli control to joint
jurisdiction.
	   Netanyahu has complained that the Palestinian Authority has
repeatedly violated the agreement, including by inciting against
Israel in the dispute over the prisoners.
	   ``We have seen a constant attempt by the Palestinians to erode
the agreement, to ignore the agreement, or to violate it
flagrantly,'' he said in remarks broadcast Friday.
	   Palestinian negotiators have said that Clinton has promised
Arafat in a meeting earlier this week that he would do his utmost
to resolve the prisoner dispute.
	   Under the Wye River peace agreement, Israel agreed to free 750
Palestinian prisoners by the end of January and in a first stage
last month freed 250, most of them common criminals.
	   Netanyahu has said that most of the so-called security prisoners
did not fit his criteria for release. He has said he would not free
those involved in attacks that led to death or injury, or members
of the Islamic militant group Hamas.
	   Palestinian officials have said the pool of those eligible for
release, even under Netanyahu's rules, was much larger. They said
only 300 of the 2,500 were convicted of killing Israelis, and that
only about 1,250 were members of Islamic militant groups.
	   In a related development, a Palestinian university student who
participated in an attack on an Israeli soldier and seized his M-16
assault rifle has been arrested.
	   The rifle was handed over to the governor of the West Bank town
of Ramallah, Mustafa Issa, on Wednesday night, several hours after
about a dozen Palestinians pelted an Israeli car with stones,
pulled the soldier out of the vehicle and struck him repeatedly in
the head with rocks.
	   The soldier escaped with head injuries. The incident, captured
by TV cameras, triggered an outrage in Israel and contributed to
Netanyahu's decision to suspend the troop withdrawal.

<TEXT>
	   MAMMOTH MOUNTAIN, California (AP) _ Ylva Nowen has called on two
friends to help her get out of an early-season funk.
	   Following finishes of 10th and 11th in the season's first two
slaloms, Nowen has brought back the skis on which she won four
races and the World Cup slalom title last season.
	   ``I've had trouble in training on the new skis, so I've gone
back to my old ones to help my confidence,'' the Swede said before
Friday's super-giant slalom race at this resort in the Sierras.
``The problem is the old skis are almost worn out. There's not much
left.''
	   Nowen, always a good skier but never a champion until breaking
through in her ninth season, admits there's a lot of pressure on
her now, most of it self-imposed.
	   ``I thought about the slalom title all summer,'' she said. ``I
told myself I don't want to be any worse than last year. But of
course I was first last year so it will be difficult not to fall a
little.''
	   Nowen was 10th in the season-opening slalom at Park City, Utah
two weeks ago and 11th in Thursday's slalom at Mammoth Mountain.
	   ``I've been nervous,'' the 28-year-old Nowen said. ``It was
easier last year; I was so relaxed.
	   ``This year I'm being too careful when I ski. It's almost like I
was scared, if that's the right word. I'm not sure of myself.''
	   Jitters have always been a problem for Nowen, who consulted a
sports psychologist to help her relax in competition. It paid off
last year, and more of the same might be in order this winter.
	   ``What I need is some really good training,'' she said. ``On the
new skis, I just haven't trained that well.''
	   Even though Nowen has disappointed herself so far, there is a
Swedish slalom star this year. She's 17-year-old Anja Paerson, who
won Thursday's race by coming from 15th place after the first run.
	   Nowen laughed when reminded that Paerson listed her and teammate
Pernilla Wiberg as her idols when growing up.
	   ``It is a little strange when you think about it,'' she said.
``We never think of Anja as being 17. She's so good in every sport
and she's really smart. She's really grown up.''
	   And with a World Cup victory to her credit after only five
career starts, she's set a target for Nowen and the rest of the
slalom squad.
	   ``She's very good in giant slalom and slalom,'' she said.
``She's always been very good in training so we can compare
ourselves to her. That's what I need, some good training.''

Israeli warplanes raid guerrilla bases in South Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with pro-Israeli militiaman wounded, two Israelis and
an allied militiaman injured by friendly fire; no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes bombed suspected
guerrilla bases in South Lebanon Friday for the second day,
Lebanese security officials said.
	   Hours later, Hezbollah guerrillas wounded a pro-Israeli
militiaman in an attack on outpost of the South Lebanon Army
militia in the eastern sector of the Israeli-occupied zone, the
officials said.
	   In a separate incident, two Israeli soldiers and an SLA
militiaman were injured when they mistakenly opened fire on each
other in the occupied zone, an Israeli military spokesman said in
Jerusalem.
	   Two Israeli jets fired at least two missiles at targets in a
valley between the villages of Habboush and Arab Salim, five
kilometers (three miles) north of this southern market town, the
Lebanese officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the air raid.
	   The targeted area is believed to be used by the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their allied
Lebanese militiamen in the occupied zone.
	   On Thursday, Israeli warplanes attacked suspected guerrilla
bases after mortar and rocket attacks on Israeli outposts in the
occupied enclave. There were no casualties from the Hezbollah
attack or the Israeli raid.
	   Israeli warplanes have attacked suspected Hezbollah bases in the
south almost daily since Nov. 8.
	   Hezbollah guerrillas have been waging a guerrilla war to oust an
estimated 1,500 Israeli soldiers and their 2,500 allied militiamen
from the zone that Israel set up in 1985 to protect its northern
territory from guerrilla attacks.
	   Seven Israeli soldiers were killed in bomb attacks by Hezbollah
guerrillas last month, sparking an intense debate in Israel about
the government's Lebanon policy.

Former Argentina junta members named in child kidnapping cases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ An investigation into charges
that members of Argentina's former military junta illegally adopted
children from dissidents will be expanded to include three more
officers, a judge said Friday.
	   Federal judge Adolfo Bagnasco is expected to name as suspects
Reynaldo Benito Bignone, the last de facto president under the
military dictatorship; and the final heads of the military, former
Lt. Gen. Cristino Nicolaides and former Adm. Ruben Franco.
	   Former Navy Adm. Emilio Eduardo Massera was arrested last week
and Jorge Videla, a former army lieutenant general, was detained
earlier this year, both on charges of child kidnapping and
falsifying documents.
	   Judges are investigating whether a systematic plan existed for
the illicit adoption of more than 200 children born to dissidents
in captivity during the 1976-83 ``dirty war.''
	   The fate of the parents was similar to that of nearly 9,000
Argentines who disappeared during the military regime's war on
leftists and dissidents, according to the government. Human rights
groups say the figure is closer to 30,000.
	   As chief of the military, Videla had final authority over death
squads that tortured and murdered political opponents, mainly
leftists.
	   Massera was responsible for the Navy Mechanics School, a
training facility converted into a clandestine killing center
during the seven-year military dictatorship.
	   In 1985, many of the senior members of the dictatorship were
sentenced to life in prison for human rights abuses. However, the
three cited by Bagnasco were not.
	   President Carlos Menem pardoned the imprisoned leaders, along
with all middle and senior-ranking officers, in 1990.
	   The move outraged human rights groups. They have searched for
ways to circumvent the order and bring former military officials to
justice.
	   The detentions of Videla and Massera revealed one of the
loopholes in the presidential pardon, which does not include child
kidnapping charges.

Albring criticizes media crackdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on Friday criticized Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's crackdown on the independent media in his country
during a speech in the United States.
	   ``The advance of information technology only adds to our faith
here in the United States that truth will ultimately prove stronger
than any dictator,'' Albright told an audience in Atlanta, Georgia.
A text was made available here.
	   ``Accordingly, we vigorously oppose efforts to suppress
independent voices such as Serb President Milosevic's recent,
inexcusable crackdown on journalists in his country,'' Albright
added.
	   The Yugoslav government has enacted a restrictive media law that
effectively shut down several independent Belgrade papers and led
to heavy fines for several others whose articles were deemed
anti-state activity.
	   The crackdown occurred amid Western efforts to end the fighting
in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are battling for
independence from Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic.
	   Albright said she was encouraged that ``in recent decades, the
right to democratic governance has won increasing acceptance
worldwide as the cornerstone for protecting the full range of human
rights.''
	   ``Of course, we know that each country must come to democracy at
its own speed and by its own path,'' she added. ``But countries
that have already established such systems can help.''

U.S., Caribbean troops prepare for marijuana mission

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Caribbean troops are training to
rappell from U.S. helicopters and avoid booby traps in dense
tropical foliage on a mission to destroy marijuana on the island
nation of St. Vincent.
	   Training begins this weekend, despite protests from hundreds of
marijuana growers who say they have no way to make a legal living.
	   ``At this time of year, if the U.S. comes here and destroys our
plantations, that will spell hardship and the business sector will
feel the pinch for Christmas,'' said protest leader Junior Cottle.
	   His new Marijuana Farmers movement, which claims to have 800
members, sent a letter to President Clinton on Thursday demanding
compensation for lost marijuana plants.
	   Six U.S. Marine Corps helicopters will ferry more than 120
troops from the Caribbean Regional Security Service and St. Vincent
police force to uproot and burn marijuana plants on remote northern
plots next week.
	   The two-week operation, targeting mountainous terrain near the
4,000-foot (1,200 meters) Soufriere Volcano, was requested by St.
Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Sir James Mitchell.
	   Similar operations in recent years destroyed millions of plants
in Trinidad, St. Kitts, St. Lucia, Dominica and Antigua. But none
stirred the kind of organized protest seen in St. Vincent.
	   Without their plants, the farmers say unemployment in St.
Vincent and the Grenadines will rise above today's 40 percent.
That, coupled with U.S. action against the Caribbean's vital banana
industry, could lead to unrest on the island chain, they said.
	   ``We have 8,000 people whose livelihood depends on marijuana,''
said Cottle.
	   With an estimated 12,350 acres (5,000 hectares) in production,
St. Vincent is the eastern Caribbean's largest marijuana producer.
Most is consumed on neighboring islands.
	   St. Vincent business leaders concede that, though illegal,
marijuana has become important to their economy _ and could become
more so because the United States successfully challenged at the
World Trade Organization a European Union quota system that was
crucial to the region's banana industry.
	   Mitchell and other Caribbean leaders have long warned that,
without a European market for their bananas, many farmers will turn
to marijuana or to smuggling cocaine and heroin. In St. Vincent,
population 110,000, the banana industry employs up to 60 percent of
the workforce.
	   But Mitchell told the farmers that tolerating their illegal work
could lead to U.S. sanctions. Many farmers planned to harvest their
plants before the U.S. helicopters arrive.
	   U.S. officials say the Marines will only transport troops, not
destroy plants. But there are risks, said Marine Lt. Col. Jeff
Douglass.
	   Regional troops will be trained to detect booby traps, such as
shaved bamboo sticks in pits or crude pipe guns fired by trip wire,
Douglass said.

Germany announces China visit even as Foreign Minister meets

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with TV report, Foreign Ministry spokesman says no
protest received &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said
Friday he expects to visit China in the spring, even as his Foreign
Minister met with China's most famous dissident in a move that
angered the Beijing government, German TV reported.
	   Calling ties to China extremely important, Schroeder said the
visit could take place in May.
	   Schroeder said he hoped to deepen ties and noted that China was
playing an important role in stabilizing Asia's struggling
economies by not devaluing its currency.
	   Meanwhile Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer met with dissident
Wei Jingsheng and discussed human rights in China, officials said.
	   Beijing protested the meeting, according to TV reports, although
a foreign ministry spokesman said the Ministry had not received any
formal protest.
	   China routinely objects when dissidents are given an audience
with a foreign government. China says Wei, whom it exiled last
year, is a criminal.
	   Wei's talk with Joschka Fischer in Bonn reflected what the
6-week-old center-left government says is a new emphasis on human
rights in German foreign policy.
	   ``Of course we see the topic's sensitivity, but there can be no
ban on talks,'' government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said.
	   Chinese-German ties have been strained by last month's expulsion
of a German magazine reporter from China for allegedly stealing
state secrets.
	   The reporter, Juergen Kremb, speculated that Chinese officials
wanted to punish him for occasionally critical reporting and for
contacts with dissidents, including Wei, about whom Kremb published
a book last year.
	   ``Fischer was interested in Wei's view and asked him for his
assessment of the current situation in China,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Martin Erdmann said. He refused to give details of the
talks.
	   Wei was in Germany to attend a ceremony marking the 50th
anniversary of the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Court rules some stores can remain open on Jewish Sabbath
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a landmark ruling, an Israeli court said
some stores can remain open on the Jewish Sabbath.
	   The Jerusalem District Court ruled Thursday that stores in
kibbutzim, or communal farms, can operate during the Sabbath. Most
kibbutzim are secular communities.
	   The ruling was seen as a victory for secular rights activists
fighting against what they see as religious coercion.
	   Observant and secular Jews find themselves increasingly at odds
over what role religion should play in daily life. One of the
battle grounds is observance of the Jewish Sabbath which runs from
sundown Friday to sundown Saturday.
	   Under Jewish law, all work and commercial activity is banned
during the Sabbath and traditionally, shops in Israel have been
closed during the biblically mandated day of rest.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the ruling, saying
that it made a distinction between kibbutz members and other
Israelis, Israel TV's Channel Two said Friday.
	   Netanyahu was quoted as saying he favored keeping the status
quo.
	   Kibbutz leaders, in turn, accused Netanyahu of pandering to the
three religious parties that are key members of his shaky
coalition.

Police seize six-tons of cocaine in Caribbean port
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout doubling the amount of cocaine seized,
other details; No pickup. NEW to some points. &QL; 
 &UR; By FERNANDO LLANO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) _ In one of the largest drug busts in
Colombian history, police have seized nearly six tons (5.4 metric
tons) of cocaine in a maritime warehouse in the Caribbean port city
of Cartagena.
	   Police reported late Thursday they had seized three 3 tons (2.7
metric tons) of cocaine, but that figure was doubled on Friday as
searches continued.
	   The cocaine was found in green metal drums marked as containing
polyester resins. The drugs were hidden in false walls built into
containers waiting to be loaded onto a cargo ship destined for
Cuba, said the deputy commander of the anti-narcotics police, Col.
Benjamin Munoz.
	   Police arrested a man whose name appeared on documents as the
cargo's owner.
	   Authorities had yet to inspect one container thought to hold
another three tons (3,000 kilos) of cocaine, Munoz said. Police
were tipped off to the shipment by an informant.
	   The bust was the second major cocaine seizure this year in
Cartagena, a steamy tourist destination 400 miles (650 kilometers)
north of Bogota.
	   In July, authorities seized seven tons (6.4 metric tons) of
cocaine disguised as a shipment of nylon and headed for the United
States by way of Mexico. They described it as the biggest seizure
of pure cocaine ever in Colombia.
	   The country produces more than 80 percent of the cocaine sold in
the United States and a growing share of the heroin.
	   Earlier this week, Cartagena was the site of a conference of the
hemisphere's defense ministers, at which military leaders from
around the Americas pledged greater cooperation in the fight
against illegal narcotics.

Fearing local elections upheaval, Nigerian police tighten security

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with borders sealed. Quotes and details of national
appeal by Gen. Abubakar. Edits to conform. No pickup.

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Borders were being sealed and riot
policemen cruised the streets ahead of Saturday's local government
elections, seen as a key first step in Nigeria's planned transition
from army rule to democracy.
	   More than 50 million people are registered to vote for 8,000
municipal government posts throughout the oil-rich country, which
is Africa's most populous. Nine parties have registered for the
elections, three of which have fielded candidates nationwide.
	   Although on Friday there was no sign of violence, authorities
were not taking chances. More than 100,000 officers were being
deployed at polling stations across the country.
	   It is the first vote since Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar outlined
his plan earlier this year to hand over power to civilians next May
after presidential elections on February 15.
	   In a brief national television and radio broadcast, Abubakar
appealed to Nigerians to vote peacefully.
	   ``These elections are unique in the annals of Nigerian political
development,'' he said. ``I therefore urge all Nigerians to seize
this opportunity offered them in the true spirit of democracy to
come out and participate.''
	   Saturday's poll is a key test run. The national electoral
commission is inexperienced and the political parties have vague
platforms and are relatively unknown.
	   Any party that fails to pick up at least 5 percent of the vote
in 24 of Nigeria's 36 states will be eliminated from the ballot for
the presidential poll.
	   Abubakar, who took control in June following the death of the
late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, has promised the military will not
intervene in the transition.
	   Nigeria has a history of armed coups and military meddling in
politics. The country has been ruled by civilians for only 10 years
since independence in 1960.
	   But Abubakar has also warned that parties that campaign on
divisive ethnic lines will be barred from the presidential poll.
	   Simmering ethnic tensions prompted authorities to cancel polling
in a number of towns and villages in oil-rich southwestern Nigeria,
including several communities near the oil port town of Warri,
about 200 kilometers (125 miles) southeast of Lagos, where sporadic
fighting between Ijaw and Itsekiri youths continued.
	   ``I would like to appeal to the politicians and political
parties to play the game by the rules. They must learn to believe
in the principle that the end does not justify the means,''
Abubakar said in his speech on Friday. ``Those who win should learn
to be magnanimous in victory while losers should be gallant in
defeat.''
	   Thousands of police and soldiers were deployed in major cities,
including more than 9,000 riot squad officers aiding regular
patrolmen in the sprawling commercial capital of Lagos.
	   All of Nigeria's land borders were expected to be sealed by
Friday night in order to head off concerns that political parties
might bring in foreigners to vote fraudulently.
	   Abubakar was expected to make an appeal for calm in a national
television address later on Friday evening.
	   Since official campaigns began last week, colorful ads promising
jobs and ethnic representation have quickly filled radio and
television airwaves and crowds of people have followed cars blaring
election promises on loudspeakers.
	   No firm favorites have emerged for the presidential poll,
although former military ruler Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo has sought
the leadership of the Peoples' Democratic Party, whose members also
include Nigeria's last civilian vice-president Alex Akueme.
	   Obasanjo, who came to power in 1976 after a failed coup attempt
took the life of military leader Gen. Murtala Muhammed,
relinquished power and retired in 1979.

Report: Plane hijacked in southern Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A passenger plane was hijacked Friday in southern
Russia, Russia's NTV television reported.
	   The hijackers' demands were unclear. The plane was traveling
from the Siberian city of Omsk to the southern Russian city of
Krasnodar.
	   Dozens of riot troops, fire engines and police gathered at the
Krasnodar airport, NTV said.
	   No other details were immediately available.
	   Airport security has worsened in Russia since the Soviet Union
fell apart in 1991. Hijackers have targeted domestic flights a
number of times, but in most cases have given up after negotiating
with authorities.

<TEXT>
	   ERIE, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Johnny Bizzarro, who made unsuccessful
bids for the world junior lightweight and lightweight boxing titles
during the 1960's, is dead at the age of 60.
	   Bizzarro died Thursday night in the emergency room at St.
Vincent's Hospital. An autopsy will be performed.
	   Bizzarro, a native of Italy and longtime resident of Erie,
compiled a 54-11 record with two draws and 24 knockouts. He bid for
the junior lightweight title in 1963 and lost a 15-round decision
to Gabriel ``Flash'' Elorde in Philadelphia. In 1966, he was
stopped in the 12th round by Carlos Ortiz in a challenge for the
lightweight championship at Pittsburgh.
	   Survivors include his wife and seven children.
	   Funeral arrangements were pending.

Annan upbeat on eve of Lockerbie talks with Gadhafi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
Friday he wanted to resolve differences ``once and for all'' with
Libya about putting two suspects on trial for the 1988 Pan Am
bombing over Lockerbie.
	   Annan, speaking to reporters on the eve of talks with Libyan
leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi, said a U.N. team ``has done some good
work on the Lockerbie dossier.''
	   ``We will try to resolve some problems and to find solutions
together _ once and for all,'' Annan said, referring to Saturday's
talks.
	   In an apparent bid to distance the Libyan leader from a decision
on the suspects' fate, Egypt's official news agency MENA quoted
official Libyan media as saying Gadhafi was not in a position to
sign an agreement to hand over the suspects.
	   ``Gadhafi is neither president nor prime minister nor foreign
minister, but only the leader of the Libyan revolution and, as
such, Col. Gadhafi is not empowered to sign an agreement,'' the
report said.
	   Annan has received clearance to fly to Libya, despite U.N.
sanctions banning flights to and from the country. There was no
official word on where the talks, scheduled for Saturday morning,
would be held.
	   The U.N. sanctions have been in place since 1992 to try to force
Libya to hand over the suspects accused of the bombing over
Scotland that killed 270 people.
	   A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly with Annan's
legal counsel to discuss a U.S.-British proposal to try the
suspects in the Netherlands according to Scottish law and using
Scottish judges.
	   Tunisia was Annan's last scheduled stop of a swing through North
Africa aimed at unblocking plans for a referendum on the fate of
the disputed Western Sahara territory.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The decision by the 11 European nations
adopting the new euro currency to cut interest rates effectively
launches monetary union one month ahead of schedule, while boosting
confidence in the historic project.
	   Even Germany's finance minister, who had been demanding such
cuts for months, appeared pleased Friday with the lower interest
rates, nearly unified at 3 percent, which should give boost to
slowing growth.
	   ``This is the right path, and I think now that we have a chance
to avoid a too-sharp drop in growth,'' Finance Minister Oskar
Lafontaine said in Washington, before he met with U.S. Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin.

Gaudenzi retires in fifth set to give Sweden 1-0 lead

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Gaudenzi out for weekend, tendon injury, quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Defending champion Sweden took a 1-0 lead
over Italy in the Davis Cup final Friday when Italy's Andrea
Gaudenzi, troubled by a sore shoulder, retired with the score 6-6
in the fifth set of a nearly five-hour marathon against Magnus
Norman..
	   Italy's No. 1 player, who had rallied from a 0-4 deficit in the
decisive set, strained his already sore shoulder as he hit an ace
to take a 6-5 lead and seemed headed toward a dream victory in
front of a sold-out partisan crowd.
	   Gaudenzi said he had strained a shoulder tendon and is out for
the rest of the final _ a significant blow to Italy's chances. He
had been slated to play doubles Saturday and another singles match
Sunday.
	   Italian fans, who had racuosly supported Gaudenzi's comeback
attempt, looked stunned as the 25-year-old tossed his racket in
despair and gave up to the younger Swede with the tally 6-7 (9-11),
7-6 (7-0), 4-6, 6-3, 6-6.
	   ``I felt pain in the middle of the second set and it really
became bad in the middle of the third,'' Gaudenzi said. ``I could
not hit the ball properly.''
	   Sweden's No. 1 player Magnus Gustafsson was to face Davide
Sanguinetti in the second singles of the day.
	   Norman, at No. 52, was the lowest-ranked among singles players
in the final and a late replacement for injured teammate Thomas
Johansson.
	   ``I feel very sad for Andrea, who was playing an unbelievable
match,'' the Swede said. ``I was also pretty glad to leave the
court with victory.''
	   Norman had wasted a match point in the 10th game and appeared
exhausted when the first singles of the best-of-5 series came to a
halt on the slow clay indoors at the Assago Forum just outside
Milan.
	   Gaudenzi had not played a match since Italy's surprising 4-1

	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ U.S. Commerce Secretary William
Daley visited a third African country on Friday, continuing to warn
that the continent faces difficult times ahead unless it tackles
debilitating corruption.
	   Daley, who is being accompanied by 15 American business leaders,
said American firms were only willing to invest in African
countries that are committed to building strong, efficient legal
and judicial systems.
	   ``Legal structures are needed to attract foreign trade,''
Secretary of Commerce William Daley said. ``I don't always like to
see lawyers in Washington, but they are necessary. And so are
effective courts.''
	   Daley visited with Ivorian government officials, attended the
opening of a U.S.-African conference on legal affairs and met with
local chiefs, who robed him in traditional cloth.
	   Daley, who is the top U.S. trade official, is scheduled to
travel on Sunday to Nigeria, where he will meet with military
leader Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who since taking power this June
has spearheaded reforms aimed at handing over power to elected
civilians next year.
	   Africa accounts for less than one percent of U.S. trade, largely
as a result of corruption, according to Daley's aides.

Chief U.N. weapons inspector in Russia to discuss Iraq

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ U.N. inspectors may finish reviewing Iraq's
weapons programs within weeks, Russia's foreign minister said
Friday after talks with the chief U.N. inspector.
	   ``It is hard to talk about breakthroughs,'' Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov said, according to the Interfax news agency. But ``we
can claim with confidence that we are at the end of the road.'' He
did not elaborate.
	   Visiting chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler discussed
the Iraqi crisis with Ivanov and other top Russian officials
Friday.
	   The Russian government has staunchly opposed the use of force
against Iraq, while urging Iraq to fully cooperate with U.N weapons
inspectors.
	   Ivanov called his two-hour meeting with Butler ``very
constructive.''
	   Butler, who heads the U.N. Special Commission charged with
making sure Iraq dismantles its weapons of mass destruction, also
met with Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor Posuvalyuk, who oversees
Iraq and other Mideast countries.
	   Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz is expected to arrive in
Moscow on Sunday for a four-day visit that will include a meeting
with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, the Russian Foreign Ministry
said in a statement Friday.
	   On Thursday, Aziz accused U.N. weapons inspectors of providing
enemy intelligence agencies with information obtained from its
weapons searches. Aziz called on U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
to stop such contacts.
	   Aziz and the Russians will discuss the situation in Iraq,
``particularly in the context of a comprehensive review by the U.N.
Security Council of the fulfillment of its resolutions by
Baghdad,'' the statement said.
	   The U.N. weapons inspectors must certify that Iraq has complied
with U.N. resolutions calling for the dismantling of the country's
nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and long-range missiles
before the Security Council can lift crippling economic sanctions
imposed after Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Baghdad has accused the Special Commission of working on behalf
of the United States to prolong the sanctions.
	   Iraq's recent refusal to cooperate with weapons inspectors
prompted the United States and Britain to threaten a military
strike. Responding to the threat, Iraq agreed Nov. 14 to resume
cooperation with weapons inspectors.
	   Moscow, which is owed billions of dollars from Iraq in debt left
over from Soviet times, is generally sympathetic to the Arab nation
and has called for an early lifting of the sanctions.

France, Britain agree that Europe needs independent defense
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 7-8 with U.S. State Department reaction &QL; 
 &UR; By THIBAULT LEROUX &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-MALO, France (AP) _ France and Britain on Friday agreed
that Europe needs a stronger, more independent defense policy to
help it react more effectively to international crises.
	   In a joint statement, French and British leaders said the
European Union should have the ability to act independently, using
``credible military'' forces.
	   But they added that European military forces would act in
conformity with existing alliances, in particular with NATO.
	   ``It is vital for Europe to have a stronger and more coherent
force and voice in international affairs,'' British Prime Minister
Tony Blair told a news conference after meeting with President
Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin in this Brittany
port town.
	   Chirac called the joint declaration ``an affirmation of the
European Union on the international scene.''
	   ``We wanted to take a major step forward,'' Chirac said,
emphasizing that Europeans want to put in place ``a real foreign
defense policy.''
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Foley welcomed
the outcome of the summit.
	   ``Certainly, the United States' interest is clear,'' Foley said.
``We want a European partner that's capable of acting.''
	   Earlier Friday, Defense Ministers Alain Richard of France and
George Robertson of Britain, meeting aboard two frigates, signed an
agreement that would allow for greater cooperation in crisis
management and military operations.
	   Britain and France, both nuclear powers and U.N. Security
Council members, traditionally have been at odds over the role of
the European Union.
	   But both now recognize the need for Europe to cope militarily
when the United States does not get involved in crises.
	   The EU is sensitive to criticism that it reacts too slowly and
in disjointed fashion to crises such as Kosovo, forcing the United
States to take the lead.
	   France has been pushing for an independent European defense,
starting with a European pillar within NATO. But Britain has said
NATO must remain the cornerstone of defense and security.
	   Paris and London have stressed there are no plans yet to abolish
the Western European Union, the EU's fledgling defense arm, or to
merge it into the European Union.
	   French officials say the summit, unprecedented in terms of the
number of officials attending, was the result of a change in
British policy toward the EU since Blair's Labor Party took over
from the Conservative Party in May 1997.
	   Topics on the agenda also included EU tax levels, small
business, and cooperation in Africa, where both countries have
former colonies.
	   The two countries also agreed to propose to fellow EU leaders a
reprieve for duty-free shopping within the European Union, which is
due to be abolished next year.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with officials not confirming report, bomb reported. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A passenger plane was hijacked Friday in southern
Russia, Russia's NTV television reported.
	   The hijackers' demands were unclear. The plane was traveling
from the Siberian city of Omsk to the southern Russian city of
Krasnodar.
	   Dozens of riot troops, fire engines and police gathered at the
Krasnodar airport, NTV said.
	   An officer with the airport police in Krasnodar told NTV a
flight attendant had been told there was a bomb aboard.
	   No other details were immediately available.
	   Spokesmen for the Federal Security Service and Emergencies
Ministry said they had no information about the hijacking.
	   Airport security has worsened in Russia since the Soviet Union
fell apart in 1991. Hijackers have targeted domestic flights
several times, but in most cases have given up after negotiating
with authorities.

Nuclear Power Plant Sacks Board and Manager
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- The Paks Nuclear Power Plant Co. on
Friday fired its entire board of directors, including the general
manager, following what was described as a series of minor
incidents, the state-run MTI news agency reported.
	   MTI said general manager Jozsef Szabo was replaced by chief
engineer Sandor Nagy. The plant's owner, the Hungarian Electricity
Works, also said development director Peter Fazekas was appointed
chairman.
	   HEW replaced the board and the management primarily to safeguard
the safety of operations, the parent company's general manager
Istvan Bakacs said.
	   He was quoted by MTI as saying the company had an inadequate
communication policy and that an ``unprofessional management'' of
recent minor incidents at the power plant could undermine its
public image.
	   The new general manager has worked in the plant's safety
division since 1992. The owners said he is expected to give
priority to safety over growth.

India's prime minister to expand cabinet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ An Indian politician negotiating nuclear
arms control with the United States is likely to be inducted into
the cabinet of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, domestic news
agencies reported Friday.
	   Vajpayee is expanding his 40-member council of ministers on
Saturday and is likely to make Jaswant Singh, the nuclear arms
negotiator, a government minister, Press Trust of India news agency
reported.
	   Singh lost federal parliamentary elections early this year and
could was not included in the Cabinet. At that time, speculation
was rife he would become finance minister. Following his defeat, he
was appointed chief of the government's planning commission, which
draws up development programs for the country.
	   Following the six nuclear tests in May and increased U.S.
pressure on India to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,
Vajpayee relied on Singh's negotiating skills to discuss the issue
with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.
	   Vajpayee is also likely to make his chief political adviser,
Pramod Mahajan, a government minister, PTI and United News of India
news agency said. Mahajan, like Singh, also lost parliamentary
elections. Subsequently, he was appointed to the upper house of
Parliament.
	   Two other posts vacated by members of a regional party are also
likely to be filled by representatives of that group, the agencies
reported.
	   The names of the ministers are officially announced just minutes
before President K.R. Narayanan _ the constitutional head of
government _ administers the oath of office to them at a ceremony
in the presidential palace.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The Palestinians said Friday that
they'll stick to the timetable of the Wye River peace agreement
even if Israel does not.
	   Palestinian Cabinet ministers who met Friday evening were to
prepare for the next step, a mid-December gathering under the
auspices of U.S. President Bill Clinton that is to reaffirm that
the Palestinians no longer seek Israel's destruction.
	   Ahead of Clinton's visit, some 2,500 Palestinians jailed by
Israel for anti-Israeli activities prepared to launch a hunger
strike to press for their early release.
	   The hunger strike, to begin Saturday, will be accompanied by
protest marches and commercial strikes, all aimed at sending a
message to Clinton that the Wye River peace agreement cannot
proceed until the dispute over the prisoners has been settled, said
Issa Karakeh, head of the Palestinian Prisoners' Association.
	   ``We want to show him (Clinton) that the prisoner issue is an
important one for the Palestinian people,'' Karakeh said.
	   The criteria for prisoner releases have become a major point of
contention between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
	   The dispute has contributed to the latest crisis which
culminated in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
announcement earlier this week that he was suspending the upcoming
West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu said he would hold up the accord until Arafat dropped
plans to unilaterally declare a state next year and accepted
Israel's criteria for releasing prisoners.
	   Arafat adviser Nabil Abourdeneh demanded Friday that Israel
resume implementation. ``As for the Palestinian Authority, it has
and will continue to implement its part of Wye River agreement,''
he said.
	   Washington believes the crisis is not genuine and will be
resolved before Clinton's arrival, the Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot
said on Friday, quoting unidentified U.S. officials.
	   On Friday evening, the Palestinian Cabinet and the PLO Executive
Committee were to discuss procedures for convening the Palestine
National Council, the Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, and
various Palestinian groups on Dec. 14.
	   On that day, the PNC and the other groups are to ``reaffirm'' a
letter to Clinton in which Arafat declares that clauses of the PLO
founding charter calling for Israel's destruction are void. The
session is being convened as part of the Wye accord.
	   Immediately after the gathering, five percent of the West Bank
are to be transferred from sole Israeli control to joint
jurisdiction.
	   Netanyahu has complained that the Palestinian Authority has
repeatedly violated the agreement, including by inciting against
Israel in the dispute over the prisoners.
	   ``We have seen a constant attempt by the Palestinians to erode
the agreement, to ignore the agreement, or to violate it
flagrantly,'' he said in remarks broadcast Friday.
	   Palestinian negotiators have said that Clinton has promised
Arafat in a meeting earlier this week that he would do his utmost
to resolve the prisoner dispute.
	   Under the Wye River peace agreement, Israel agreed to free 750
Palestinian prisoners by the end of January and in a first stage
last month freed 250, most of them common criminals.
	   The Wye agreement was vague on the types of prisoners who would
qualify and Netanyahu has said most of the so-called security
prisoners did not fit his criteria for release.
	   Netanyahu has said he would not free those involved in attacks
that led to death or injury, or members of the Islamic militant
group Hamas.
	   Palestinian officials have said the pool of those eligible for
release, even under Netanyahu's rules, was much larger. They said
only 300 of the 2,500 were convicted of killing Israelis, and that
only about 1,250 were members of Islamic militant groups.
	   In a related development, a Palestinian university student who
participated in an attack on an Israeli soldier and seized his M-16
assault rifle has been arrested.
	   The rifle was given to the governor of the West Bank town of
Ramallah, Mustafa Issa, on Wednesday night, several hours after
about a dozen Palestinians pelted an Israeli car with stones,
pulled the soldier out of the vehicle and struck him in the head
with rocks.
	   The soldier escaped with head injuries. The incident, captured
by TV cameras, triggered outrage in Israel and contributed to
Netanyahu's decision to suspend the withdrawal.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A passenger plane that had reportedly been
hijacked landed safely in southern Russia on Friday, emergency
officials said.
	   Security agents combed the plane for explosives, and all the
passengers disembarked, said Vasily Yurchuk, spokesman for Russia's
Emergencies Ministry.
	   The airport in the southern Russian city of Krasnodar had
apparently received a phone threat saying there was a bomb aboard
the plane, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Dozens of riot troops, fire engines and police gathered to meet
it when it landed Friday night, Russia's NTV television reported.
	   But Yurchuk said no hijacker was found on the plane.
	   The plane was traveling from the Siberian city of Omsk to
Krasnodar.
	   Airport security has worsened in Russia since the Soviet Union
fell apart in 1991. Hijackers have targeted domestic flights
several times, but in most cases have given up after negotiating
with authorities.

Rain delays balloon launch by Branson and Fossett
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARRAKECH, Morocco (AP) _ Rain has forced Virgin boss Richard
Branson and Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett to delay their bid to
circle the globe in a hot air balloon, officials said Friday.
	   The wealthy businessmen, once rivals but now joining forces, now
hope to launch their balloon as of Dec. 9 if weather permits, Mouna
Benomar, a member of the team, said.
	   For a month, about 50 people have busily been preparing for the
takeoff at Marrakech's military airport.
	   The two former rivals will be accompanied by Swedish balloonist
Pers Lindstrand in the Virgin Global Challenger. They also have a
backup balloon in case their main one is damaged.
	   Fossett broke his distance record in August, traveling more than
15,200 miles (24,320 kilometers) before a storm damaged his
balloon, sending it plunging into the sea off Australia.
	   Branson, the flamboyant tycoon whose Virgin company name adorns
everything from record stores and clothing to an airline, has
failed to accomplish the feat in four attempts.
	   Branson's previous attempts have been hampered by weather. The
only time he managed to take off _ in January 1997 _ his balloon
crash-landed in the Algerian desert.

Gaudenzi succumbs to hurt shoulder in fifth set
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs, RECASTS. UPDATES with more quotes. will be updated after
second match. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ After five grueling hours, Andrea Gaudenzi
succumbed to the pain.
	   His shoulder aching, his knee bloody, his white outfit caked
with clay, Italy's top player grunted, grimaced and gutted it out
deep into the fifth set Friday against Sweden's Magnus Norman in
the opening match of the Davis Cup final.
	   Seeing, though, that he could no longer swing the racket with
his injured right shoulder, Gaudenzi retired from the match while
serving at 6-6 in the deciding set.
	   An initial diagnosis found a strained tendon, and Gaudenzi was
ruled out of the rest of the competition _ a serious blow to
Italy's hopes for its first title in 22 years.
	   He had been slated to play doubles Saturday and another singles
match Sunday.
	   ``Right now I can not even lift a glass of water,'' Gaudenzi
said after the match. ``I just could not hit the ball with proper
power.''
	   The partisan sellout crowd of 12,000 at the Assago Forum gave
the Italian a standing ovation when he conceded by tossing his
racket across the clay court.
	   It was a sudden end to a long, error-filled match that saw the
players alternate taking the first four sets.
	   Gaudenzi took the first set 7-6 (11-9), Norman the second 7-6
(7-0), the Italian the third 6-4, and the Swede the fourth 6-3.
Norman _ at No. 52, the lowest ranked singles player among the four
starters here _ held a match point while serving at 5-4 in the
fifth, but Gaudenzi eliminated it with a forehand winner down the
line and later broke serve.
	   Norman, clearly tiring at the end, totaled 82 unforced errors to
60 for Gaudenzi, who's 44th in the ATP rankings.
	   Italy's Davide Sanguinetti faced Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden,
the defending champion, later Friday in the best-of-5 series'
second match.
	   It is the first Davis Cup final in the event's 99 years that
does not have any singles players from the top 30.
	   Gaudenzi had not played a match since helping Italy upset the
United States in September's Davis Cup semifinals, and had surgery
on the shoulder in October.
	   ``I was bothered by light pain during practice this week,'' he
said, ``but I decided to play because it was a Davis Cup final in
Italy.''
	   As expected, the crowd was raucous.
	   They urged Gaudenzi on with soccer-style ``Ole'' chants, yelled
``Idiot, idiot'' at Norman when he contested calls on a few
occasions, and often interrupted the run of play with whistling,
clapping or shouting.
	   Gaudenzi, a former world junior No. 1 who excels in the charged
atmosphere of the Davis Cup, started showing signs of trouble in
the third game of the third set. He clutched his right arm after
sending a backhand into the net, and headed to the locker room
during the ensuing changeover.
	   ``I felt pain in the middle of the second set and it really
became bad in the middle of the third,'' Gaudenzi said. ``I could
not hit the ball the right way.''
	   A trainer massaged the shoulder before the closing set, and
again during the final changeover. Gaudenzi hit two weak serves
that Norman ripped for winners in the 13th game, and then called it
quits after 4 hours, 56 minutes.
	   ``I was for sure more prepared than he was physically,'' said
Norman, who underwent heart surgery a year ago. ``I mean, I feel
very sad for Andrea, but I think I deserve to win because I was
fighting.''

Eleven-year-old gives birth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ An 11-year-old girl gave birth Friday
to a baby girl and the 17-year-old father could face up to 10 years
in prison for sex with a minor, the state-run news agency MTI
reported.
	   The girl, who has not been identified, lives with her family in
Boldogkoeujfalu, a small village in the romantic Zemplen mountains,
160 kilometers (100 miles) northeast of Budapest.
	   She has three siblings, the youngest of whom is three years of
age.
	   She was taken to the county hospital in Miskolc last week and
doctors, fearing complications, induced labor Thursday and
delivered the baby, weighing 2.5 kilograms (5.5 lbs) with a
Ceasarian section.
	   Both mother and baby have been reported in good condition.
	   Hungarian law forbides sexual relations with a girl of 12 years
or younger. It carries a sentence of 5-10 years imprisonment.
	   The father, who was also not identified, has yet to be charged,
MTI reported.

Winter Goodwill Games planned; Lake Placid likely site
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Get ready for some extreme Goodwill on snow and
ice.
	   The first winter edition of the Goodwill Games, an international
sports event styled after the Olympics, is planned for 2000, most
likely in Lake Placid, New York, Turner Sports president Harvey
Schiller said.
	   While the four summer versions of the games have focused on
traditional sports, the winter debut will try to attract a younger,
non-traditional audience.
	   ``There probably will be some extreme events included,''
Schiller said. ``Maybe some of the bobsled or luge teams will go
down the track backwards.''
	   It's more likely that the Goodwill schedule will include events
along the lines of ice climbing, snow bicycling and super-modified
shovel racing. While not Olympian, they are attractive for U.S.
television ratings, especially in the much-sought-after audience of
males in their teens and 20s.
	   Other sports on the program include Alpine skiing, figure
skating, speedskating, bobsled, luge and at least one cross-country
ski event, according to Schiller.
	   Dates have not been set, but Schiller said the event probably
would span 6-7 days, 2-3 days longer than originally planned
because of the addition of more sports.
	   A Winter Goodwill Games has been talked about for several years.
Schiller, in a telephone interview from his Atlanta office Thursday
night, said a final decision would be made shortly.
	   Schiller said the go-ahead would wait until Goodwill Games
president Mike Plant returned from an overseas vacation.
	   Lake Placid, host city of Winter Olympics in 1932 and 1980, was
the ``probable'' site, ``but there are other possibilities in the
mix,'' Schiller added.
	   The other potential host cities were not identified.
Lillehammer, Norway, where the 1994 Winter Olympics were held, was
Schiller's target when Schiller first mentioned a Winter Goodwill
Games several years ago.
	   In Lake Placid, officials said negotiations with Turner had
``progressed well'' but that no final word had come.
	   ``There are still some things that need to be worked out,'' said
Ginny Valenze, public relations direction for the Olympic Regional
Development Authority, which runs the winter sprints facilities.
``We remain positive. It would be a wonderful opportunity and a
great Christmas present.''
	   For Lake Placid to stage the full games would require rebuilding
the bobsled and luge track, which has fallen apart since the 1980
Winter Olympics.
	   The dlrs 20 million project could be finished by next winter,
although it would require round-the-clock work during Lake Placid's
short construction season, according to Sandy Caligiore, spokesman
for the U.S. Luge Association.
	   ``We're ready to build it,'' Valenze said.
	   The Goodwill Games were the brainchild of media mogul Ted
Turner, held first in Moscow in the summer of 1986 to try and thaw
the sports cold war between East and West that had produced two
straight Olympic boycotts.
	   While the East bloc is gone, Goodwill continues, losing millions
of dollars for Turner and parent company Time Warner but providing
cable TV programming for the fourth summer edition in New York.
	   By going to a winter edition and expanding the schedule to
include youth-oriented events, Turner moves onto ground broken by
U.S. sports cable channel ESPN, which televised the ``Winter X
Games'' in 1997. The third edition of that event next month will
feature ice climbing, ski boarding, ``big air'' ski and snowboard
races, snowmobiling and even video-game competition.
	   ESPN has Winter X Games IV tentatively scheduled for January
2000, spokesman Mike Soltys said.

TVM doctor Mikhailov released from custody
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARIE-FRANCE BEZZINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REIMS, France (AP) _ Andrei Mikhailov, the doctor for the TVM
team implicated in one of the doping scandals that overshadowed the
Tour de France, was released from custody on Friday, judicial
sources said.
	   Mikhailov had been in custody since July 27.
	   Odile Madrolle, the Reims judge investigating the TVM case, also
lifted judicial controls on the team's sporting director, Cees
Priem, and trainer, Jan Moors, allowing both to return home to the
Netherlands.
	   Both had been freed on Aug. 10 but were required to report daily
to local police.
	   The judicial sources were speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   All three TVM officials remain under formal investigation, one
step short of being formally charged.
	   Madrolle made the decision after interviewing seven TVM cyclists
on Thursday, the source said.
	   She interviewed Dutchmen Joroen Blijlevens, Tristan Hoffmann,
Servais Knaven and Bart Voskamp, Belgium's Hendrick van Dijk and
Peter van Petegem, and Sergei Outschakov of Ukraine.
	   TVM withdrew from the Tour de France during the race, saying
police tactics made it impossible for its riders to compete.
	   But on Thursday, judicial sources, citing the results of medical
tests taken during the Tour, said that four cyclists took EPO _ one
of whom also took both amphetamines and cannabis _ and that others
had traces of corticoides.
	   French customs authorities found banned substances in a TVM team
van back in March, but the discovery only became public in July,
after the doping controversy that saw the expulsion of Festina from
the Tour.
	   During the tour, police found more evidence suggesting the use
of banned drugs in a hotel trash can used by the TVM team.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A passenger plane that had reportedly been
hijacked landed safely in southern Russia on Friday, emergency
officials said.
	   Security agents combed the Tu-154 for explosives and searched
all the passengers, but found no bomb and no hijacker, said a

would not give his name.
	   Dozens of riot troops, fire engines and police gathered at the
Krasnodar airport to meet the plane when it landed Friday night,
Russia's NTV television reported.
	   It was unclear how many passengers were aboard or whether they
knew of the bomb threat.
	   Airport security has worsened in Russia since the Soviet Union

Sweden leads 2-0 as Gaudenzi succumbs to hurt shoulder
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sweden win to lead 2-0. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ After five grueling hours, Andrea Gaudenzi
succumbed to the pain.
	   His shoulder aching, his knee bloody, his white outfit caked
with clay, Italy's top player grunted, grimaced and gutted it out
deep into the fifth set Friday against Sweden's Magnus Norman in
the opening match of the Davis Cup final.
	   But no longer able to get any strength from his injured right
shoulder, Gaudenzi retired from the match while serving at 6-6 in
the deciding set.
	   An initial diagnosis found a strained tendon, and Gaudenzi was
ruled out of the rest of the competition _ a serious blow to
Italy's hopes for its first title in 22 years.
	   He had been slated to play doubles Saturday and another singles
match Sunday.
	   ``Right now I can not even lift a glass of water,'' said
Gaudenzi, who fought back from a 4-0 deficit in the last set. ``I
just could not hit the ball with proper power.''
	   Defending champion Sweden took a commanding 2-0 lead in the
best-of-5 series later Friday when Magnus Gustafsson overpowered
Italy's Davide Sanguinetti 6-1, 6-4, 6-0 in a mere 1 hour, 30
minutes.
	   Sweden can clinch its seventh Davis Cup title Saturday by taking
the doubles.
	   The partisan sellout crowd of 12,000 at the Assago Forum jeered
and whistled derisively at Sanguinetti _ a far cry from the
standing ovation awarded Gaudenzi when he conceded by tossing his
racket across the clay court.
	   That was a sudden end to a long, error-filled match that saw the
players alternate taking the first four sets.
	   Gaudenzi took the first set 7-6 (11-9), Norman the second 7-6
(7-0), the Italian the third 6-4, and the Swede the fourth 6-3.
Norman _ at No. 52, the lowest ranked singles player among the four
starters here _ held a match point while serving at 5-4 in the
fifth, but Gaudenzi eliminated it with a forehand winner down the
line and later broke serve.
	   Norman, clearly tiring at the end, totaled 82 unforced errors to
60 for Gaudenzi, who's 44th in the ATP rankings.
	   Italy's Davide Sanguinetti faced Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden,
the defending champion, later Friday in the best-of-5 series'
second match.
	   It is the first Davis Cup final in the event's 99 years that
does not have any singles players from the top 30.
	   Gaudenzi had not played a match since helping Italy upset the
United States in September's Davis Cup semifinals, and had surgery
on the shoulder in October.
	   ``I was bothered by light pain during practice this week,'' he
said, ``but I decided to play because it was a Davis Cup final in
Italy.''
	   As expected, the crowd was raucous.
	   They urged Gaudenzi on with soccer-style ``Ole'' chants, yelled
``Idiot, idiot'' at Norman when he contested calls on a few
occasions, and often interrupted the run of play with whistling,
clapping or shouting.
	   Gaudenzi, a former world junior No. 1 who excels in the charged
atmosphere of the Davis Cup, started showing signs of trouble in
the third game of the third set. He clutched his right arm after
sending a backhand into the net, and headed to the locker room
during the ensuing changeover.
	   ``I felt pain in the middle of the second set and it really
became bad in the middle of the third,'' Gaudenzi said. ``I could
not hit the ball the right way.''
	   A trainer massaged the shoulder before the closing set, and
again during the final changeover. Gaudenzi hit two weak serves
that Norman ripped for winners in the 13th game, and then called it
quits after 4 hours, 56 minutes.
	   ``I was for sure more prepared than he was physically,'' said
Norman, who underwent heart surgery a year ago. ``I mean, I feel
very sad for Andrea, but I think I deserve to win because I was
fighting.''

Iranian woman detained at airport, charged in Israeli Embassy

bombing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Argentina's Supreme Court charged
an Iranian woman Friday in the 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy
in Buenos Aires.
	   Police detained Nahrim Mokhtari at the Ezeiza International
Airport on the edge of Buenos Aires after she disembarked Friday
from a flight from Paris that was bound for Montevideo, Uruguay.
	   Mokhtari is the first person to be charged in the bombing, which
claimed 29 lives. The exact nature of her involvement was not
disclosed.
	   She was expected to appear later Friday before the Supreme
Court, which by Argentine law presides over cases involving foreign
embassies.
	   Mokhtari is the former girlfriend of Wilson dos Santos, who was
arrested last month in Brazil and is believed to have critical
information about the embassy bombing and a 1994 attack on a Buenos
Aires Jewish community center, which killed 85 people.
	   He has reportedly said he was aware of the plans through
Mokhtari, who he claimed had links to a terrorist group.
	   Argentine authorities had been pursuing dos Santos for over a
year.
	   Dos Santos has said he alerted Argentine diplomatic officials
four months before the 1994 bombing that the attack was in the
works. But he claimed officials didn't take him seriously.
	   Israeli and U.S. intelligence agencies have attributed both
bombings to Iranian-supported terrorist groups.
	   A used-car dealer and four Buenos Aires province police officers
are in prison awaiting trial for preparing the van that police say
was used in the Jewish community center bombing.

Thyssen shareholders vote overwhelmingly for merger with Krupp
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUISBERG, Germany (AP) _ Thyssen shareholders Friday voted
overwhelmingly in support of a merger with their traditional rival,
industrial group Krupp, clearing a last hurdle toward creating
Europe's biggest steel concern.
	   The vote _ 96,77 in favor _ did not come as a surprise. Krupp
shareholders approved the merger Monday with a 99.97 percent vote.
	   About 2,000 jobs will be lost in the merger, due to take place
in March.
	   As Europe's fifth-biggest industrial concern, the new Thyssen
Krupp AG would rank behind carmakers DaimlerChrysler and
Volkswagen, and electronics and communications giants Siemens and
Veba.
	   The companies predict their joint operations will post 70
billion marks ($40 billion) in sales for the 1998 fiscal year.
	   Krupp and Thyssen announced plans to merge last November, saying
it would save as much as 450 million marks ($250 million) in costs
and give the combined company a stronger position in world markets.
Krupp, based in Essen, had earlier dropped a hostile bid for
Thyssen after workers protested over potential job losses.
	   Together, the companies employ some 180,000 people.

Adams warns Belfast accord `could bleed to death'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates throughout for AMs &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Sinn Fein party leader Gerry
Adams warned Friday that Belfast's peace accord ``could bleed to
death'' if the stalemate over forming a new compromise government
is not quickly overcome.
	   Moderate Catholic politicians joined the Irish Republican
Army-allied party in blaming the impasse on Protestant leader David
Trimble, who flew Friday to Washington denying any crisis lay
ahead.
	   Both accused the Ulster Unionist Party leader of misleading
British Prime Minister Tony Blair during negotiations that seemed
to bear fruit, but fell apart hours after Blair's departure
Thursday.
	   Trimble's would-be Catholic colleague at the head of the as yet
unformed cross-community government, Seamus Mallon, sharply rebuked
the Protestant politicians.
	   ``People did not honor their word. That's putting it as mildly
as I possibly can,'' Mallon told the BBC.
	   Trimble accused Mallon's Social Democratic and Labor Party, the
moderate Catholic party, of ``presenting fresh demands'' after
Blair had left.
	   Trimble and Mallon's party leader, John Hume, will receive the
Nobel Peace Prize on Thursday.
	   Adams, who met Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern in Dublin,
accused Trimble of ``playing a slow, long hand, seeking to erode
and dilute and hollow out the substance of this agreement.''
	   The Sinn Fein leader said Trimble and his colleagues, ``when
Blair was here, went technically through the motions. And when he
went away they unraveled them.''
	   ``I could not underestimate the seriousness of this impending
crisis, said Adams, whose party wants two posts in the new
government. ``The whole danger is that the agreement could bleed to
death.''
	   Ahern declined to comment.
	   Blair and Ahern had expected local politicians to have formed
Northern Ireland's new administration by now, and to have agreed
terms for the way that government shapes policy with the Irish
Republic.
	   Thursday's illusory agreement specified that the government
would have 10 departments, and that it would cooperate with the
Irish government on seven committees dealing with issues like
tourism, trade and cross-border waterways.
	   Both sides still expect to reach a deal along these lines, but
possibly not until January _ too late for the agreement's plan to
transfer power from the British government to local politicians in
February.
	   Also Friday, Northern Ireland's police commander accused
Protestant extremists of attacking his forces in Portadown, a town
southwest of Belfast that has long been a focal point for sectarian
violence.
	   Police clashed overnight with Protestants protesting for the
right to march through a hostile Catholic enclave. Authorities in
July blocked an intended march by the Orange Order, Northern
Ireland's major Protestant brotherhood, but Thursday night's
demonstrators vowed a march would get through by Christmas.

Rights group says government is blocking visits to detained leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BASSEM MROUE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian authorities have prevented the
lawyers and wife of a human rights leader from visiting him in a
prison known for ``inhuman treatment,'' the rights group said
Friday.
	   Hafez Abu Saada, the secretary general of the Egyptian
Organization for Human Rights, has been detained since Tuesday and
is thought to be held in Tora Istiqbal prison, southern Cairo. He
was arrested on an accusation of receiving foreign money to harm
Egypt's reputation.
	   The EOHR has said it accepted a donation of dlrs 25,703 from a
British Parliament committee.
	   An Egyptian weekly, Al-Osboa, alleged last month that the
donation was a ``payment'' for an EOHR report that accused police
of arresting and torturing hundreds of Coptic Christians in a
criminal investigation in a southern Egyptian village in August.
The magazine has close ties to the Interior Ministry, which is
responsible for security in Egypt.
	   The government has denied the torture allegations but
transferred four policeman from the village, pending an
investigation.
	   Early this week the EOHR said it was returning the British
donation.
	   ``The prison, where the secretary-general is being held, is
considered one of Egypt's worst prisons in terms of inhuman
treatment and bodily harm,'' the EOHR said in a statement sent to
The Associated Press on Friday.
	   The group said all attempts to get permission to visit Abu Saada
had failed. His wife, Nehal, had received a permit to visit him,
but was blocked by ``numerous excuses'' from the authorities.
	   Foreign rights groups have called for Abu Saada's release.
	   In London, the International Center Against Censorship said
Friday it had sent a message to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
asking him ``to ensure the safety and immediate release'' of Abu
Saada.
	   In New York, Human Rights Watch called Thursday for Abu Saada's
release and ``an end to government harassment and intimidation of
Egyptian human rights organizations.''
	   ``The government should be investigating and prosecuting torture
in the police and security forces, not sending human rights
activists to prisons,'' Human Rights Watch said.
	   The government has refused to register a single Egyptian human
rights group, putting them in the precarious position of operating
without the status of an approved non-governmental organization.
	   On Wednesday, EOHR announced it was freezing its activities
because of what it called a government campaign to ``terrorize the
organization and eliminate its role.''
	   Abu Saada can be held 15 days for investigation.

Israeli warplanes raid guerrilla bases in South Lebanon

an allied militiaman injured by friendly fire; no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes bombed suspected
guerrilla bases in South Lebanon Friday for the second day,
Lebanese security officials said.
	   Hours later, Hezbollah guerrillas wounded a pro-Israeli
militiaman in an attack on an outpost of the South Lebanon Army
militia in the eastern sector of the Israeli-occupied zone, the
officials said.
	   In a separate incident, two Israeli soldiers and an SLA
militiaman were injured when they mistakenly opened fire on each
other inside Israel's self-declared security zone in southern
Lebanon, an Israeli military spokesman said in Jerusalem.
	   Two Israeli jets fired at least two missiles at targets in a
valley between the villages of Habboush and Arab Salim, five
kilometers (three miles) north of this southern market town, the
Lebanese officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the air raid.
	   On Thursday, Israeli warplanes attacked suspected guerrilla
bases after mortar and rocket attacks on Israeli outposts in the
occupied enclave. There were no casualties from the Hezbollah
attack or the Israeli raid.
	   Israeli warplanes have attacked suspected Hezbollah bases in the
south almost daily since Nov. 8.
	   Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas have been waging a guerrilla
war to oust an estimated 1,500 Israeli soldiers and their 2,500
allied militiamen from the zone that Israel set up in 1985 to
protect its northern territory from guerrilla attacks.

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ The rock group Hootie and the Blowfish
gave some 2,000 Americans a little Christmas cheer on this tiny
Middle Eastern island Friday.
	   ``We are here to bring a piece of America for those the brave
men women who are sacrificing so much in the interest of their
nation,'' lead singer Darius Rucker told the crowd of servicemen
and families at the U.S. 5th Fleet's base in Bahrain.
	   Rucker and his 3 fellow musicians donned Santa Claus hats before
taking to the stage for a two-hour performance.
	   ``It's just like a part America flew in to say `hello' to us,''
said Chief Petty Officer, Jeff Strickland, 33, of Tampa, Florida as
he swayed to the music with his arms on wife Early and 2-year-old
son Zachary.
	   Petty Officer Steve Pappas, 31, of Fieldon, Illinois, who limped
up to the wooden stage on crutches, said he had been following the
band since college days.
	   ``They are a great American band and I wouldn't want to miss
this opportunity,'' said Pappas, who works on the minesweeper USS
Ardent.
	   The concert was organized by the United Service Organization,
which provides entertainment and other services to over 1.4 million
U.S. military personnel and their families around the world.
	   Hootie and the Blowfish are scheduled to fly to the United Arab
Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bosnia, and Hungary on their 10-day tour
for the USO.

Palestinians take next step to implement Wye agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Palestinians taking next step in peace
accord, Israel saying efforts fall short of what is required; EDITS
to TRIM &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The Palestinians on Friday took the
next step toward carrying out the land-for-security agreement even
though Israel has suspended implementation for now.
	   The PLO Executive Committee began preparing for a mid-December
gathering in Gaza City under the auspices of U.S. President Bill
Clinton that is to reaffirm earlier pledges that the Palestinians
no longer seek Israel's destruction.
	   However, a new crisis with Israel was already shaping up at a
time when the current one was still unresolved.
	   Under the Wye River peace agreement, the Palestine National
Council, the Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, and various
Palestinian groups are to meet on Dec. 14.
	   On that day, the PNC and the other groups are to ``reaffirm'' a
letter to Clinton in which Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
declares that clauses of the PLO founding charter calling for
Israel's destructions are null and void.
	   Israel has maintained that the PNC is required to take a vote by
a show of hands. The Palestinians have said the Wye agreement does
not call for a vote.
	   ``There will be no vote in this meeting,'' Zakaria Agha, a PLO
Executive Committee member, said after the Friday evening meeting.
	   After the PNC session, five percent of the West Bank are to be
transferred from sole Israeli control to joint jurisdiction.
	   David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, suggested Friday that there would be no
handover of land without a PNC vote.
	   ``It has been made clear that Israel will not withdraw troops if
the Palestinians do not adhere to their commitments under the Wye
agreement,'' Bar-Illan said. ``We will bring it up with the
Americans.''
	   As part of the Wye agreement, the Arafat letter listing the PLO
charter clauses considered revoked is to undergo a three-stage
process of approval.
	   Last month, the 18-member PLO Executive Committee reaffirmed the
letter. On Dec. 10, the 120-member Palestinian Central Council,
which is comprised of senior Palestinian officials and legislators,
will approve the letter by vote, Agha said, citing Friday's
decision.
	   The final step is the PNC session at the Shawa Cultural Center
in Gaza City on Dec. 14. About 1,500 people will be gathered to
hear speeches by Clinton and Arafat. The PNC has more than 500
members, including many who live abroad. Also attending will be
members of various Palestinian groups.
	   The PLO Executive Committee asked the PNC chairman, Salim
Zanoun, on Friday to begin sending out invitations for the Dec. 10
and the Dec. 14 gatherings, Agha said.
	   Ahead of the Clinton visit, some 2,500 Palestinians jailed by
Israel for anti-Israeli activities prepared to launch a hunger
strike to press for their early release.
	   The hunger strike, to begin Saturday, will be accompanied by
protest marches and commercial strikes, all aimed at sending a
message to Clinton that the peace agreement cannot proceed until
the dispute over the prisoners has been settled, said Issa Karakeh,
head of the Palestinian Prisoners' Association.
	   The criteria for prisoner releases have become a major point of
contention between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
	   The dispute has contributed to the latest crisis which
culminated in Netanyahu's announcement earlier this week that he
was suspending the upcoming West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu said he would hold up the accord until Arafat dropped
plans to unilaterally declare a state next year and accepted
Israel's criteria for releasing prisoners.
	   Netanyahu complained that the Palestinian Authority repeatedly
violated the agreement, including by inciting against Israel in the
dispute over the prisoners.
	   ``We have seen a constant attempt by the Palestinians to erode
the agreement, to ignore the agreement, or to violate it
flagrantly,'' he said.
	   The Clinton administration has been angered by Netanyahu's
decision, but also believes the crisis is not genuine and will be
resolved before Clinton's arrival, the Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot
said Friday, quoting unidentified U.S. officials.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Friday's protests; No pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PANAMA CITY (AP) _ Riot police fired tear gas and plastic
bullets Friday to try to break up protests against a government
plan to privatize Panama's water system.
	   The police dispersed hundreds of students who blocked main
streets for more than two hours near the University of Panama.
	   The students fled to the university campus, throwing rocks and
sticks at police.
	   There were no immediate reports of injuries or arrests on the
second day of protests over the plan to end government control over
the water system, a move demonstrators fear will cause price hikes.
	   Officers also broke up a similar protest at the National
Institute high school, firing tear gas and plastic bullets at
students who blocked streets there, student leaders said.
	   The high school students sought refuge in their school and threw
rocks at police.
	   The unrest followed protests Thursday by thousands of union
workers angered over the planned sale of the National Institute of
Aqueducts and Sewers. Riot police used tear gas to keep the workers
from charging the Congress building.
	   The government argues that privatization is needed to modernize
the water system and make it more efficient. It already has
authorized the sale of Panama's electrical services and 49 percent
of its telecommunications industry.

Documentary marking Solzhenitsyn's 80th birthday canceled
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian television station canceled plans Friday
to air a documentary marking the 80th birthday of Nobel laureate
and Soviet dissident Alexander Solzhenitsyn after he objected.
	   The film, called ``The Chosen One,'' was to air on Russia's RTR
television Friday, the 25th anniversary of the first publication of
his renowned work ``The Gulag Archipelago.''
	   But less than two hours before its scheduled broadcast, the
station announced on its evening news that it had canceled the
showing.
	   RTR said it had sent Solzhenitsyn a copy of the tape for review,
but Solzhenitsyn said he had not seen the film and didn't want it
to air without his approval.
	   Russia's other two main television stations have also prepared
documentaries to mark his birthday, which is Dec. 11.
	   The ORT television station showed the first part of its
documentary, ``The Knot,'' on Friday. NTV will show its film, ``The
Life of Solzhenitsyn,'' next week.
	   Solzhenitsyn's works ``One Day in the Life of Ivan
Denisovitch,'' ``The Gulag Archipelago'' and ``Cancer Ward'' laid
bare cruelties and repressions of the Soviet system.
	   ``The Gulag Archipelago'' was first published in Paris in 1973,
and Solzhenitsyn was arrested and expelled from the Soviet Union
the following year. He lived in Vermont for 18 years, then returned
to Russia in 1994.
	   He enjoyed much more influence as a dissident than he does
today. He is fiercely critical of post-Soviet Russia, but many find
his proposed solutions to be overly conservative, nationalistic or
irrelevant.
	   He won the Nobel prize for literature in 1970.

Medical student helps pull Honduran town through hurricane

<TEXT>
	   MOROLICA, Honduras (AP) _ Her home washed away in the night,
Keilyn Rodriguez awoke on a stranger's cold cement floor, hungry,
wet and aching. Her baby was crying, sniffling children were lining
up at her door, and one of her patients was going into labor.
	   The 26-year-old medical student wanted to escape, to climb over
the debris that Hurricane Mitch had dumped on her village, and walk
away. But she stayed _ and for more than a month provided almost
the only medical attention to 3,500 people whose homes were buried.
	   ``I was hysterical,'' said Rodriguez, who was finishing up an
internship at a rural clinic in her hometown. ``I kept telling my
mom, `I can't. I can't. I don't even have gloves. How am I going to
deliver a baby?' But she told me, `You are all the people have.'''
	   Morolica, 60 miles (100 kilometers) southeast of the Honduran
capital of Tegucigalpa, is an extreme case of the plight of towns
across Central America, where Hurricane Mitch killed more than
9,000 people in its sweep through the region a month ago.
	   Mitch damaged hundreds of villages that were already mired in
poverty, where medical students doing required training _ like
Rodriguez _ were the only doctors people knew.
	   ``She doesn't need to be here, but she wants to be with us,''
said one of Rodriguez's patients, 50-year-old Maria Luisa Espinar.
``We love her very much.''
	   Medical school never taught Rodriguez what Mitch forced her to
learn _ how to care for hundreds of people with no medicine, no
equipment and no access to the outside world. It wasn't addressed
in her treasured medical books, which her father had worked
overtime to afford.
	   Not that it mattered. They were buried with her home and the
rest of the village.
	   On Oct. 30, the hurricane-powered Choluteca and Chiquito rivers
jumped course and roared straight through the town, wiping Morolica
off the map.
	   Everyone fled _ the last ones, like Rodriguez, in chest-deep
water. Most went to Las Delicias, to the south. The last group, cut
off by flooding, fled to Tejar, to the north. A few, afraid to be
on low land, slept in the mountains.
	   A woman in Tejar offered to put up Rodriguez and her family. The
next day, under a steady rain, Rodriguez climbed to an adobe
mountain home where a 25-year-old woman lay in bed, sweating and
writhing from labor pains.
	   The area's two nurses were on the other side of the mountain in
Las Delicias, unable to get through. Four hours later, a girl was
born two months premature.
	   Rodriguez cleared the baby's lungs with an eye dropper. She
warmed the tiny, underweight infant, who should have had an
incubator, under her jacket, keeping her close to her heart.
	   ``We prayed for a helicopter to come and take her to a hospital
where she could be put on oxygen,'' Rodriguez said.
	   Two days later, the baby died. She was the first patient
Rodriguez had lost.
	   ``I got depressed,'' Rodriguez said. ``But I had to pull myself
out of it and worry about the others.''
	   By the end of the week, Rodriguez, who trekked an hour daily to
tend to the rest with her nurses in Las Delicias, was treating
dozens of people suffering from diarrhea, conjunctivitis,
pneumonia, malaria and dengue.
	   And still without medicine. Nurse Minita Portillo hiked five
miles (eight kilometers) to the next village for a mixture of salt,
potassium and minerals to prevent dehydration. Rodriguez educated
people on staying healthy and distributed chlorine tablets.
	   ``The hardest part was watching my 9-month-old baby girl,''
Rodriguez said.
	   ``People would say `Doctor, come here. You have another
patient,' and my baby would be crying and crying, because we had
nothing to eat except maybe a tortilla or some beans that someone
gave us.''
	   Ten days after the village was wiped out, a helicopter carried
in a team of Mexican doctors and nurses and five days later, a U.S.
aid group landed with more medicine, food and tents. But each only
stayed for a few days.
	   In another week, bulldozers arrived and cleared the road to
Morolica.
	   A month has now passed since the once-picturesque village became
a moonscape. Roof tiles poke through the sand where adobe homes
once stood. A half-buried satellite dish hints at what was once the
Rodriguez family home.
	   Rodriguez and the nurses keep busy vaccinating people against
diphtheria and measles outside the tents that house residents until
officials complete a land deal to rebuild the town on higher
ground.
	   Rodriguez, who graduates Dec. 15, hopes to work permanently in
the new Morolica, where her husband, a medical student training in
another part of Honduras, will join her.
	   But first she must find dlrs 40 to finish a postgraduate
pediatrics course, a prerequisite to being licensed.
	   The village has been unable to pay her for more than a month,
and it is unlikely it will anytime soon. But Rodriguez doesn't
worry. And neither do the villagers.
	   ``She is one of us,'' said Jesus Moncada, 65. ``And we know that
we can always trust her to take care of us.''

Rennes misses chance to put pressure on leaders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Rennes climbed to third place in the French first
division on Friday but its goalless draw at struggling Metz left it
ten points behind runaway leaders Bordeaux and Marseille.
	   Hard up Rennes' title challenge seems to be fading, as it has
now collected only two points from its last four games.
	   On Thursday, leader Bordeaux lost 2-1 at Lyon, while Marseille
drew 1-1 at Auxerre, leaving the two teams level at the top on 38
points.
	   Rennes has 28 points.
	   Lens warmed up for its key Champions League match against Dynamo
Kiev next week with a 3-0 win against Strasbourg.
	   Vladimir Smicer, Alex Nyarko and Wagneau Eloi scored second half
goals for Lens.
	   With neither of the top teams in action, attention turned to the
battle to avoid relegation.
	   In a key match between two strugglers, Lorient climbed off the
bottom with a 1-0 win at Sochaux.
	   Defender Yannick Fischer scored the winner in the 14th minute.
	   Toulouse picked up a point in a goalless draw at Paris
Saint-Germain but goes to the bottom of the standings.
	   In other games Friday: Montpellier 2, Le Havre 0; Nantes 2,
Bastia 0;

Tyson's return to boxing set to be announced
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mike Tyson is going Hollywood.
	   A news conference to announce Tyson's return to boxing will be
held Tuesday in Hollywood, California.
	   Tyson is scheduled to fight Francois Botha of South Africa Jan.
16 in the MGM Grand at Las Vegas.
	   In a release announcing the news conference at the Hollywood
Athletic Club, Showtime simply stated that Tyson and Botha would be
present. One of the contacts listed on the announcement was the MGM
Grand.
	   Tyson has gotten back his boxing license from the Nevada State
Athletic Commission, which revoked it after he was disqualified for
biting Evander Holyfield's ears June 28, 1997, but the former
heavyweight champion still has out-of-the-ring problems.
	   George Walker, the chief probation office for Marion County
(Indiana) Superior Court, has said it appeared Tyson violated terms
of his probation on a rape conviction as a result of his no-contest
plea to misdemeanor assault charges in Maryland on Tuesday.
	   It is possible Tyson could be returned to prison.
	   Tyson, who served three years on the rape conviction before
being released in 1995, is scheduled to remain on probation until
March.
	   Tyson was charged with punching one man and kicking another
after a traffic accident in Montgomery County, Maryland. He has
reached a settlement with the two men to avoid a civil suit.
	   Although a no-contest plea is not an admission of guilt, Tyson
still faces sentencing. A decision is expected in late January or
early February.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Prime Minister-Designate Salim Hoss
appointed a Cabinet on Friday of many fresh faces and without five
civil-war militia figures who had held power previously.
	   ``This government will inspire great confidence and reassure
people. It augurs well,'' Hoss told reporters after presenting his
team to President Emile Lahoud.
	   In a first step toward his goal of austerity, Hoss formed a
government of only 16 ministers, nearly half the 30-member Cabinet
of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
	   Hoss, a U.S.-educated economist whom Lahoud designated premier
earlier this week, appointed himself as foreign minister and also
took the portfolio of immigrant affairs.
	   He chose a Paris-based economist and former central bank
adviser, George Korom, as finance minister and a vice-governor of
the central bank, Nasser Saidi, as minister of economy and trade as
well as industry minister.
	   The prime minister retained only two members of Hariri's
government: Michel Murr, who remains deputy prime minister and
interior minister and takes on rural and municipal affairs as well,
and Suleiman Franjieh, who was appointed minister of agriculture
and minister of housing and cooperatives.
	   Franjieh was a Christian militia leader during the 1975-90 civil
war.
	   Other leading militiamen were dropped from the Cabinet. They
were Druse leader Walid Jumblatt and ally Akram Chehayab, Christian
militia leader Elie Hobeika, and senior Shiite Muslim Amal
officials Mahmoud Abu Hamdan and Ayyoub Hmeid.
	   The defense portfolio went to Ghazi Zuetir, a legislator from
the eastern Bekaa Valley.
	   Hoss appointed a number of specialists to what is the fifth
government he has formed since he first served as prime minister in
1976.
	   The new health minister is the head of the Gynecology and
Nursery Department at American University of Beirut, Karam Karam.
	   Judge Joseph Shaoul was appointed justice minister.
	   Another judge, Suleiman Traboulsi, was named as oil minister and
will also take on the ministry of water and hydraulic resources.
	   The Cabinet respects Lebanon's traditional power-sharing
arrangement, which divides seats equally between Christians and
Muslims. It also observes the practice of distributing seats among
the numerous faiths, giving three ministries to Sunni Muslims,
three to Shiite Muslims, two to Druse, three to Maronite Catholics,
two to Melchite Catholics, two to Eastern Orthodox and one to
Armenian Orthodox.
	   Hoss said the Cabinet would hold its first meeting on Saturday.
	   Ministers are expected to draw up a policy statement that will
be put to parliament when Hoss asks for a vote of confidence.
	   The new team is almost certain to win the vote, and so take
office, as 95 legislators told the president this week that they
would support a government led by Hoss.

Adams warns Belfast accord `could bleed to death'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Sinn Fein party leader Gerry
Adams warned Friday that Belfast's peace accord ``could bleed to
death'' if the stalemate over forming a new compromise government
is not quickly overcome.
	   Adams and moderate Catholic politicians blamed the impasse on
Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble, whom they accused of
misleading British Prime Minister Tony Blair during negotiations
that seemed to bear fruit, but fell apart hours after Blair's
departure Thursday.
	   Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern had expected local
politicians to have formed Northern Ireland's new administration by
now, and to have agreed terms for the way that government shapes
policy with the Irish Republic.
	   Thursday's illusory agreement specified that the government
would have 10 departments, and that it would cooperate with the
Irish government on seven committees dealing with issues like
tourism, trade and cross-border waterways.
	   Both sides still expect to reach a deal along these lines, but
possibly not until January _ too late for the agreement's plan to
transfer power from the British government to local politicians in
February.
	   Trimble's would-be Catholic colleague at the head of the as yet
unformed cross-community government, Seamus Mallon, sharply rebuked
the Protestant politicians.
	   ``People did not honor their word. That's putting it as mildly
as I possibly can,'' Mallon told the BBC.
	   Trimble, who flew to Washington Friday denying any crisis lay
ahead, accused Mallon's Social Democratic and Labor Party, the
moderate Catholic party, of ``presenting fresh demands'' after
Blair had left.
	   Trimble and Mallon's party leader, John Hume, will receive the
Nobel Peace Prize on Thursday.
	   Adams, who met Ahern in Dublin, accused Trimble of ``playing a
slow, long hand, seeking to erode and dilute and hollow out the
substance of this agreement.''
	   The leader of the Irish Republican Army-allied Sinn Fein party
said Trimble and his colleagues, ``when Blair was here, went
technically through the motions. And when he went away they
unraveled them.''
	   ``I could not underestimate the seriousness of this impending
crisis, said Adams, whose party wants two posts in the new
government. ``The whole danger is that the agreement could bleed to
death.''
	   Ahern declined to comment.
	   Also Friday, Northern Ireland's police commander accused
Protestant extremists of attacking his forces in Portadown, a town
southwest of Belfast that has long been a focal point for sectarian
violence.
	   Police clashed overnight with Protestants protesting for the
right to march through a hostile Catholic enclave. Authorities in
July blocked an intended march by the Orange Order, Northern
Ireland's major Protestant brotherhood, but Thursday night's
demonstrators vowed a march would get through by Christmas.

Palestinians take next step to implement Wye agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Palestinians taking next step in peace
accord, Israel saying efforts fall short of what is required; EDITS
to TRIM; No pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Palestinians on Friday took the
next step toward carrying out the land-for-security agreement even
though Israel has suspended implementation of the accord.
	   The PLO Executive Committee began preparing for a mid-December
gathering in Gaza City under the auspices of U.S. President Bill
Clinton. The meeting should confirm pledges that the Palestinians
no longer seek Israel's destruction.
	   However, a new crisis with Israel was already shaping up at a
time when the current one was still unresolved.
	   Under the Wye River peace agreement, the Palestine National
Council, the Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, and various
Palestinian groups are to meet on Dec. 14.
	   On that day, the PNC and the other groups are to ``reaffirm'' a
letter to Clinton in which Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
declares that clauses of the PLO founding charter calling for
Israel's destruction are null and void.
	   Israel has maintained that the PNC is required to take a vote by
a show of hands. The Palestinians have said the Wye agreement does
not call for a vote.
	   ``There will be no vote in this meeting,'' Zakaria Agha, a PLO
Executive Committee member, said after the Friday evening meeting.
	   After the PNC session, five percent of the West Bank is to be
transferred from sole Israeli control to joint jurisdiction.
	   David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, suggested Friday that there would be no
handover of land without a PNC vote.
	   ``It has been made clear that Israel will not withdraw troops if
the Palestinians do not adhere to their commitments under the Wye
agreement,'' Bar-Illan said. ``We will bring it up with the
Americans.''
	   As part of the Wye agreement, the Arafat letter listing the PLO
charter clauses in question is to undergo a three-stage process of
approval.
	   Last month, the 18-member PLO Executive Committee reaffirmed the
letter. On Dec. 10, the 120-member Palestinian Central Council,
which is comprised of senior Palestinian officials and legislators,
will approve the letter by vote, Agha said, citing Friday's
decision.
	   The final step is the PNC session at the Shawa Cultural Center
in Gaza City on Dec. 14. About 1,500 people will be gathered to
hear speeches by Clinton and Arafat. The PNC has more than 500
members, including many who live abroad. Also attending will be
members of various Palestinian groups.
	   The PLO Executive Committee asked the PNC chairman, Salim
Zanoun, on Friday to begin sending out invitations for the Dec. 10
and the Dec. 14 gatherings, Agha said.
	   Ahead of the Clinton visit, some 2,500 Palestinians jailed by
Israel for anti-Israeli activities prepared to launch a hunger
strike to press for their early release.
	   The hunger strike, to begin Saturday, will be accompanied by
protest marches and commercial strikes, all aimed at sending a
message to Clinton that the peace agreement cannot proceed until
the dispute over the prisoners has been settled, said Issa Karakeh,
head of the Palestinian Prisoners' Association.
	   The criteria for prisoner releases have become a major point of
contention between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
	   The dispute has contributed to the latest crisis which
culminated in Netanyahu's announcement earlier this week that he
was suspending the upcoming West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu said he would hold up the accord until Arafat dropped
plans to unilaterally declare a state next year and accepted
Israel's criteria for releasing prisoners.

Orioles sign second baseman DeShields
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID GINSBURG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ The Baltimore Orioles plugged a hole in the
middle of their infield on Friday by agreeing to a dlrs 12.5
million, three-year contract with free agent second baseman Delino
DeShields.
	   The Orioles also announced the re-signing of outfielder B.J.
Surhoff, who also had been courted by the Pittsburgh Pirates. Terms
of the deal were not disclosed.
	   DeShields, who hit .290 with the St. Louis Cardinals this
season, will fill the void left by the departure of free agent
Roberto Alomar, who signed with the Cleveland Indians last month.
	   DeShields likely will fill the leadoff spot in the batting order
vacated by Alomar. DeShields had a .371 on-base percentage, getting
122 hits and 56 walks, and led the Cardinals with eight triples.
	   There was no immediate announcement by the Orioles but the
agreement was confirmed by a source who spoke on the condition he
not be identified.
	   DeShields, who made dlrs 3 million this year, gets a dlrs
500,000 signing bonus, dlrs 3,666,667 next season and dlrs
4,166,667 in each of the final two years.
	   The addition of DeShields means the Orioles already have filled
three starting positions this week. Baltimore signed free agent
left fielder Albert Belle and traded for catcher Charles Johnson on
Tuesday.
	   The Orioles and Cardinals were the leading contenders to sign
DeShields, who stole 26 bases in 36 tries last season. Although he
isn't known for his power, he hit seven homers and drove in 44
runs.

Justice Minister recommends letting Arab from two villages return
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Justice Minister Tsahi Hanegbi has recommended
that Arab residents who were evacuated from their homes in two
villages along Israel's northern border during the 1948 Mideast war
be allowed to return their former areas, his office said Friday.
	   In a report he submitted to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
Hanegbi wrote that the residents of the villages of Baram and Ikrit
and their family members be allowed to return to areas adjacent to
their former villages and that 150 acres be set aside for the
reestablishment of each town, Justice Ministry spokeswoman Ettie
Eshed said.
	   Eshed said that Hanegbi submitted the report to Netanyahu's
office in September following consultations with top army and
internal security officials and in response to years of court
appeals by the former residents of the villages arguing for the
right of return.
	   Hanegbi said that a return of the villagers would help spark
economic growth in the financially depressed area. Now the cabinet
must vote on whether to approve the Justice Minister's
recommendations.
	   Netanyahu's office, however, said it rejected Hanegbi's
findings, Israel Television reported.
	   The villagers who are Christian Arabs were told in 1948 by
Jewish fighting forces that they needed to evacuate for their own
safety and would be allowed to return a few days later. However,
they were never permitted to return and their land was distributed
among neighboring Jewish settlements, according to Israeli Arab
lawmaker Salah Tarrif.
	   ``It seems that no government will implement such an historic
and important decision although it is the right and moral thing to
do,'' Tarrif said.
	   About 700,000 Palestinians fled or were driven out of their
homes during the 1948 war, which erupted when Arab armies attacked
Israel immediately after it declared independence.
	   However, Hanegbi said that a decision to allow the residents of
Baram and Ikrit return to areas close to their villages would not
be viewed as a precedent to allow others to return to their
original homes, Israel Television reported.

South American club playing for pride against D.C. United
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida (AP) _ For South American club champion
Vasco da Gama, Saturday's decisive InterAmerican Cup match against
D.C. United is a chance to salvage a 23-day tour that has taken the
team from Rio de Janeiro to Washington, D.C. to Tokyo and finally
to Fort Lauderdale.
	   ``We are a little tired,'' said the team's technical director
Antonio Lopes of his 1997 Brasileiro champions. ``But on Saturday,
we'll be OK.''
	   Vasco da Gama beat CONCACAF Cup holders D.C. United 1-0 on Nov.
14. D.C. United must win by two goals or more on Saturday to claim
the InterAmerican title which is determined by aggregate score over
two games. A one-goal D.C. win would force a 30-minute `golden
goal' overtime. Failing that, the teams would go to a shootout.
	   United's impressive performance in Game 1 showed how far Major
League Soccer's most successful team has progressed since debuting
in 1996. D.C. United created more scoring chances in the opener,
but lost on an inspired long-range goal by fancied newcomer Felipe.
	   ``We would never lay claims that MLS is better than the South
American leagues,'' said coach Bruce Arena. ``But we can say we're
competitive with them.''
	   Besides determining the club champion of the Western Hemisphere,
Saturday's game also closes out Arena's tenure as D.C. United coach
before he takes the U.S. National Team job.

Sweden leads 2-0; Gaudenzi succumbs to injured shoulder
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sanguinetti replacing Gaudenzi for doubles,
Italy's captain quote. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ After five grueling hours, Andrea Gaudenzi
succumbed to the pain.
	   His shoulder aching, his knee bloody, his white outfit caked
with clay, Italy's top player grunted, grimaced and gutted it out
deep into the fifth set Friday against Sweden's Magnus Norman in
the opening match of the Davis Cup final.
	   Seeing, though, that he could no longer swing the racket with
his injured right shoulder, Gaudenzi retired from the match while
serving at 6-6 in the deciding set. Officially, the score was 6-7
(9-11), 7-6 (7-0), 4-6, 6-3, 6-6 (30-0).
	   Defending champion Sweden took a commanding 2-0 lead in the
best-of-5 series when Magnus Gustafsson overpowered Italy's Davide
Sanguinetti 6-1, 6-4, 6-0 in the second singles match.
	   Sweden can clinch its seventh Davis Cup title Saturday by
winning the doubles.
	   An initial diagnosis found a strained tendon, and Gaudenzi was
ruled out of the rest of the competition _ a serious blow to
Italy's hopes for its first title in 22 years.
	   He had been scheduled to play doubles Saturday and another
singles match Sunday.
	   ``Right now I can not even lift a glass of water,'' Gaudenzi
said after the match. ``I just could not hit the ball with proper
power.''
	   The partisan sellout crowd of 12,000 at the Assago Forum gave
the Italian a standing ovation when he conceded by tossing his
racket across the clay court.
	   It was a sudden end to a long, error-filled match.
	   Norman _ at No. 52, the lowest ranked singles player among the
teams' four players _ held a match point while serving at 5-4 in
the fifth set, but Gaudenzi eliminated it with a forehand winner
down the line and later broke serve.
	   Norman, clearly tiring at the end, totaled 82 unforced errors to
60 for Gaudenzi, who is ranked 44th in the world.
	   It is the first Davis Cup final in the event's 99 years that
does not have any singles players from the top 30.
	   Gaudenzi had not played a match since helping Italy upset the
United States in the Davis Cup semifinals in September, and had
surgery on the shoulder in October.
	   ``I was bothered by light pain during practice this week,'' he
said, ``but I decided to play because it was a Davis Cup final in
Italy.''
	   As expected, the crowd was raucous.
	   They urged Gaudenzi on with soccer-style ``Ole'' chants, yelled
``Idiot, idiot'' at Norman when he contested calls on a few
occasions, and often interrupted the run of play by clapping,
shouting or blaring air horns.
	   Gaudenzi, a former world junior No. 1 who excels in the charged
atmosphere of the Davis Cup, started showing signs of trouble in
the third game of the third set. He clutched his right arm after
sending a backhand into the net, and headed to the locker room
during the ensuing changeover.
	   ``I felt pain in the middle of the second set and it became bad
in the middle of the third,'' Gaudenzi said. ``I could not hit the
ball the right way.''
	   A trainer massaged the shoulder before the closing set, and
again during the final changeover. Gaudenzi hit two weak serves
that Norman ripped for winners in the 13th game, then quit after 4
hours, 56 minutes.
	   ``I was for sure more prepared than he was physically,'' said
Norman, who underwent heart surgery a year ago. ``I feel very sad
for Andrea, but I think I deserve to win because I was fighting.''
	   With Gaudenzi out, Sanguinetti will be pressed into partnering
doubles specialist Diego Nargiso for the first time, Italy's
non-playing captain Paolo Bertolucci said.
	   ``We don't need just one miracle,'' a resigned Bertolucci said,
``we need several.''

Mitterwallner, starting 37th, wins super-G
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAMMOTH MOUNTAIN, California (AP) _ Christiane Mitterwallner of
Austria, never better than 19th in four years of World Cup racing,
surprised herself and her heavily favored teammates Friday by
winning a women's World Cup super-G.
	   Renate Goetschl, who won two downhills for Austria last weekend
in Canada, was giving interviews and receiving handshakes and hugs
from the other skiers when Mitterwallner, 24, moved into the gate
as the 37th starter.
	   Skiing on a sun-baked course that remained fast throughout the
day despite soft snow, Mitterwallner caught everyone's attention
when she reached the midway point .20 seconds faster than Goetschl.
	   Mitterwallner crossed the finish line in 1 minute, 15.64
seconds, only .05 better than Goetschl, who was .04 better than
Germany's Martina Ertl.
	   Mitterwallner seemed confused by the roar that greeted her
arrival, then saw with unbelieving eyes that her name was atop the
leaderboard. She seemed almost ready to faint as she held her hands
to her head, then sank to her knees in the snow.
	   Despite the almost tropical conditions following an overnight
storm, many late starters followed Mitterwallner's lead and punched
in startling results. Eight of the top 15 finishers started outside
the top seed, with the highest being No. 46 Katie Monahan of Aspen,
Colorado, who placed eighth. Another American, Megan Gerety of
Anchorage, Alaska, started 35th and placed 13th.
	   Some of the pre-race favorites finished well down the order.
World Cup overall points leader Alexandra Meissnitzer of Austria,
who won last week's first super-G of the season, settled for sixth
this time. Germany's Hilde Gerg, a former World Cup super-G
champion, was only 23rd.
	   Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg, a former overall champion, tied for
44th.

Editor of Togolese paper released after 45 days behind bars
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ The editor of a pro-government newspaper has
been released after spending 45 days in prison without trial for
publishing a story accusing the Togolese army of inciting
insecurity.
	   Apollinaire Mewenemesse, editor of the weekly ``La Depeche,''
was freed on Thursday from the Lome city prison. He was arrested on
October 21 after his magazine published a story accusing elements
in the military of being behind alleged border attacks earlier this
year.
	   Since his imprisonment, international human rights groups had
lobbied to secure Mewenemesse's freedom.
	   Scattered protests by opposition groups have followed the
reinstatement of President Gnassigbe Eyadema following June
elections in which vote-counting was interrupted prematurely.
	   Eyadema, who is accused of ordering a number of summary
detentions and killings, has led this tiny French-speaking nation
for 31 years since taking over in a coup that resulted in the death
of his predecessor.

Newspaper calls for ouster of government in coming elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICHARD SIMON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ The island's leading weekly
newspaper called on voters to oust the ruling New National Party in
an editorial Friday as Grenada moved toward early elections after
Parliament was dissolved.
	   The government of Prime Minister Keith Mitchell must be defeated
to end the ``corruption and deceitful government'' that has brought
political turmoil to the Caribbean nation in recent weeks, the
newspaper said.
	   Governor General Sir Daniel Williams dissolved Parliament on
Wednesday, meaning elections must be held within 90 days in the
former British colony. A date has not yet been set.
	   On Sunday, Foreign and Legal Affairs Minister Raphael Fletcher
resigned, accusing Mitchell's government of corruption.
	   The newspaper cited Mitchell's firing of former Deputy Prime
Minister Grace Duncan after her romance with Mitchell soured, and
the dismissal of another junior minister.
	   The editorial also criticized Mitchell for awarding
ambassador-at-large posts to Viktor Korzeny, a businessman who
allegedly amassed millions by taking advantage of privatization
programs in his home country, the former Czechoslovakia, and Joan
Webley, a former politician in Jamaica.
	   Opponents of Mitchell complained to the United Nations earlier
this year that Webley, who runs a U.N. program in Grenada, was also
working as a political adviser to Mitchell instead of remaining
politically neutral.

Justice Minister recommends letting Arabs from two villages return
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Justice Minister Tsahi Hanegbi has recommended
that Arab residents who were evacuated from their homes in two
villages along Israel's northern border during the 1948 Mideast war
be allowed to return their former areas, his office said Friday.
	   In a report he submitted to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
Hanegbi wrote that the residents of the villages of Baram and Ikrit
and their family members be allowed to return to areas adjacent to
their former villages and that 150 acres be set aside for the
reestablishment of each town, Justice Ministry spokeswoman Ettie
Eshed said.
	   Eshed said that Hanegbi submitted the report to Netanyahu's
office in September following consultations with top army and
internal security officials and in response to years of court
appeals by the former residents of the villages arguing for the
right of return.
	   Hanegbi said that a return of the villagers would help spark
economic growth in the financially depressed area. Now the cabinet
must vote on whether to approve the Justice Minister's
recommendations.
	   Netanyahu's office, however, said it rejected Hanegbi's
findings, Israel Television reported.
	   The villagers who are Christian Arabs were told in 1948 by
Jewish fighting forces that they needed to evacuate for their own
safety and would be allowed to return a few days later. However,
they were never permitted to return and their land was distributed
among neighboring Jewish settlements, according to Israeli Arab
lawmaker Salah Tarrif.
	   ``It seems that no government will implement such an historic
and important decision although it is the right and moral thing to
do,'' Tarrif said.
	   About 700,000 Palestinians fled or were driven out of their
homes during the 1948 war, which erupted when Arab armies attacked
Israel immediately after it declared independence.
	   However, Hanegbi said that a decision to allow the residents of
Baram and Ikrit return to areas close to their villages would not
be viewed as a precedent to allow others to return to their
original homes, Israel Television reported.

Bayern Munich's status in Bundesliga in danger after draw
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Visiting Bayern Munich was held to an unexpected
2-2 draw by injury-depleted VfL Bochum Friday, leaving the
Bavarians in danger of relinquishing the lead in the Bundesliga.
	   German international Thomas Strunz converted a hand penalty with
two minutes to play to salvage the draw for Munich against a team
saddled with nine subsitutes.
	   Striker Stefan Kuntz had put Bochum up 2-1 just two minutes
earlier on another penalty -- the second time 10th place Bochum
stunned Munich by going ahead.
	   Just three minutes into the match, Bochum's Norbert Hofman hard
shot ricocheted off the left post, then bounced in to the delight
of 33,000 at Ruhrstadium.
	   The visitors, despite wasting an earlier penalty, scrambled back
when Carsten Jancker equalized in first-half injury time. The
burley striker, catching Kuntz's header in the air, connected on a
spectacular shot from just beyond the penalty box.
	   If Leverkusen beats VfL Wolfsburg by two goals Saturday,
Christoph Daum's charges would end Munich's season-long reign at
the head of the table.
	   Despite Sasa Ciric's two goals, FC Nuremberg again failed to win
a home match as it drew 2-2 against Hansa Rostock.
	   Nigerian Victor Agali levelled for Rostock in the 86th minute,
spoiling the debut of Nuremberg's interim coach Thomas Brunner.
Abder Ramdane scored the team's first goal.
	   Willi Reimann resigned this week as Nuremberg's coach, citing
family reasons.

Palestinians take next step to implement Wye agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Palestinian Cabinet statement, final grafs &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The Palestinians on Friday took the
next step toward carrying out the land-for-security agreement even
though Israel has suspended implementation for now.
	   The PLO Executive Committee began preparing for a mid-December
gathering in Gaza City under the auspices of U.S. President Bill
Clinton that is to reaffirm earlier pledges that the Palestinians
no longer seek Israel's destruction.
	   However, a new crisis with Israel was already shaping up at a
time when the current one was still unresolved.
	   Under the Wye River peace agreement, the Palestine National
Council, the Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, and various
Palestinian groups are to meet on Dec. 14.
	   On that day, the PNC and the other groups are to ``reaffirm'' a
letter to Clinton in which Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
declares that clauses of the PLO founding charter calling for
Israel's destructions are null and void.
	   Israel has maintained that the PNC is required to take a vote by
a show of hands. The Palestinians have said the Wye agreement does
not call for a vote.
	   ``There will be no vote in this meeting,'' Zakaria Agha, a PLO
Executive Committee member, said after the Friday evening meeting.
	   After the PNC session, five percent of the West Bank are to be
transferred from sole Israeli control to joint jurisdiction.
	   David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, suggested Friday that there would be no
handover of land without a PNC vote.
	   ``It has been made clear that Israel will not withdraw troops if
the Palestinians do not adhere to their commitments under the Wye
agreement,'' Bar-Illan said. ``We will bring it up with the
Americans.''
	   As part of the Wye agreement, the Arafat letter listing the PLO
charter clauses considered revoked is to undergo a three-stage
process of approval.
	   Last month, the 18-member PLO Executive Committee reaffirmed the
letter. On Dec. 10, the 120-member Palestinian Central Council,
which is comprised of senior Palestinian officials and legislators,
will approve the letter by vote, Agha said, citing Friday's
decision.
	   The final step is the PNC session at the Shawa Cultural Center
in Gaza City on Dec. 14. About 1,500 people will be gathered to
hear speeches by Clinton and Arafat. The PNC has more than 500
members, including many who live abroad. Also attending will be
members of various Palestinian groups.
	   The PLO Executive Committee asked the PNC chairman, Salim
Zanoun, on Friday to begin sending out invitations for the Dec. 10
and the Dec. 14 gatherings, Agha said.
	   Ahead of the Clinton visit, some 2,500 Palestinians jailed by
Israel for anti-Israeli activities prepared to launch a hunger
strike to press for their early release.
	   The hunger strike, to begin Saturday, will be accompanied by
protest marches and commercial strikes, all aimed at sending a
message to Clinton that the peace agreement cannot proceed until
the dispute over the prisoners has been settled, said Issa Karakeh,
head of the Palestinian Prisoners' Association.
	   The criteria for prisoner releases have become a major point of
contention between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
	   The dispute has contributed to the latest crisis which
culminated in Netanyahu's announcement earlier this week that he
was suspending the upcoming West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu said he would hold up the accord until Arafat dropped
plans to unilaterally declare a state next year and accepted
Israel's criteria for releasing prisoners.
	   Netanyahu complained that the Palestinian Authority repeatedly
violated the agreement, including by inciting against Israel in the
dispute over the prisoners.
	   ``We have seen a constant attempt by the Palestinians to erode
the agreement, to ignore the agreement, or to violate it
flagrantly,'' he said.
	   The Clinton administration has been angered by Netanyahu's
decision, but also believes the crisis is not genuine and will be
resolved before Clinton's arrival, the Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot
said Friday, quoting unidentified U.S. officials.
	   During their meeting Friday night, the Palestinian Cabinet noted
American disapproval of Israel's action while reaffirming their own
intention to keep to the schedule stipulated by the Wye Accord.
	   ``The Palestinian leadership,'' a cabinet statement read, ``will
continue for its part to implement the Wye Accord according to the
timetable especially since the American administration has clearly
rejected the Israeli conditions.''

EU ministers back task force to coordinate asylum policy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union justice and interior
ministers Friday agreed to cooperate in handling the increasing
flow of asylum seekers and illegal immigrants into the 15-nation
bloc.
	   A planned task force would pool ideas on how to limit the influx
and ensure EU nations share more evenly the task of receiving them.
	   ``The solidarity of Europe should not be an empty phrase but
should become a concrete and effective policy,'' said Italy's
Interior Minister Rosa Jervolino-Russo, whose country is a favored
port of entry for refugees coming from the Balkans, the Middle East
and Asia.
	   The plan for the task force, first tabled by the Netherlands in
October, is expected to be approved by EU foreign affairs ministers
on Monday. The force should present a report on proposed joint-EU
measures to a special summit on the issue scheduled for October
1999 in Tampere, Finland.
	   Several member states, including Italy, Britain, Belgium,
Germany and the Netherlands have all faced big increases in asylum
applicants over the past year. Some have set up tented villages to
house them while asylum demands are processed.
	   ``This is an area where work with our European partners is
essential,'' said British Home Secretary Jack Straw. Asylum
applications have risen 30 percent this year in Britain compared to
1997 and stand at 33,000 for the first ten months of 1998 alone.
	   In Belgium application are up by 57 percent this year and
Justice Minister Tony Van Parijs said it was ``essential to come to
quick agreement.'' Belgium was forced to change its asylum policy
in October amid outrage over the death of a Nigerian woman during a
deportation attempt.
	   Overall Germany is the biggest recipient nation, processing some
30 percent of the EU's asylum cases. In November alone, 10,800 new
demands were entered.
	   Often, asylum seekers claiming persecution at home are deemed to
have fled for economic reasons. Of 12,208 asylum demands wrapped up
by German authorities in November, just 423 or 3.5 percent were
accepted.
	   In France and Belgium, refugees without proper papers have taken
shelter in churches. In the Netherlands, dozens of illegal
immigrants launched a hunger strike this week in a last-ditch
attempt to pressure Dutch officials to grant them residency
permits.
	   Refugees seeking asylum in western European from Yugoslavia have
doubled this year and now stand at some 5,600 a month.
	   Among the tasks to be taken on the force will be looking at how
the EU can improve the situation for potential asylum seekers in
their country of origin.

Indian team optimistic in New Zealand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ A series win over Australia earlier
this year has the Indian cricket team confident that it can record
its first test series victory in New Zealand in three decades.
	   The last time India beat New Zealand in a series in New Zealand
was in 1968 when Nawab Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi's visitors beat the
Kiwis 3-1.
	   Mohammad Azharuddin, the current Indian captain, who has five
batsman ranked in the world top 20, believes his side is capable of
emulating that feat.
	   While Azharuddin said New Zealand is always difficult on their
home soil, he said India's 2-1 series win over Australia in March
has instilled a belief that the visitors are as good as any other
side in the world.
	   ``Beating Australia gave us tremendous confidence, I thought
Australia were a very, very good side,'' Azharuddin said.
	   ``We really played well against Australia, everyone did their
job _ the bowlers and batters _ so it was a big boost for us.''
	   Coach Anshuman Gaekwad said the tourists had two four-day
matches against Central Districts and Wellington to get their game
plan right for the first test starting on Dec. 18 in Dunedin.
	   The Indians have won 13 of the 35 tests between the two
countries, 16 have been drawn while New Zealand has won six. (djp)

Brazilian markets close down slightly a day after heavy losses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilian markets see-sawed Friday and
ended down a day after shedding nearly 9 percent on news that
Congress failed to pass key reforms deemed essential to the
government's economic austerity package.
	   After dipping as low as 2.6 percent, Sao Paulo's Bovespa stock
exchange closed down 1 percent in light trading. The smaller Rio de
Janeiro stock exchange shed 1.2 percent in extremely light trading.
	   In the morning, the Bovespa rose as much as 2.9 percent, amid a
feeling the market had overreacted to Congress' failure to pass an
increase in social security taxes and a cut in pensions.
	   The measure, expected to save at least 2.5 billion reals (dlrs
2.1 billion) next year, was an important part of the government's
recently announced plan to cut the country's burgeoning debt and
make it eligible for dlrs 41.5 billion in international aid.

Maxi Priest, others arrive for largest concert ever in Kenya
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIANNA CAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Reggae artist Maxi Priest arrived in Kenya
on Friday to gear up for what promoters hoped would be the largest
pop music concert ever.
	   Priest, South African reggae hit Lucky Dube, Levi Roots and
Jamaican Johnny Clark were among the top billings for Sunday's
outdoor concert at the Ngong Racecourse in Nairobi, a venue that
can accommodate 100,000 people.
	   On Friday, however, the concert's promoter said only 15,000 to
20,000 tickets had been sold.
	   Priest, who arrived in Kenya Friday to headline the concert of
local and foreign performers, said it was his first visit to Kenya.
	   ``It's great,'' he said. ``The people are wonderful.''
	   Another performer, Levi Roots, said the visit to Kenya was the
pinnacle of his career.
	   He said the concert would be good for Kenyans following the Aug.
7 twin bombings at the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that
claimed the lives of 224 people, most of them Kenyan.
	   ``I think the people of Kenya need this right now,'' said the
reggae artist, who met last week with victims of the bombing.
	   Despite the enthusiasm of the artists and the potential size of
the audience, the concert's organizer and sponsors were not
expecting it to be a huge moneymaker.
	   ``Sponsorship as a rule is not a moneymaking exercise per se, in
other words, you don't actually make a profit.'' said Alasdair
Musselwhite, East African marketing manager for Guinness breweries,
the event's major sponsor.
	   Dean Gordon, of Barrow Gordon Associates which is promoting the
concert, hopes to build a long-term investment in entertainment in
Kenya, a nearly nonexistent enterprise to date because everything,
including whether the artist will show up, is often unpredictable.
	   Partner Paul Barrow said he has been working on the show for two
years, ever since his mother fell ill during a Christmas trip to
the Kenyan coast and he spent several weeks awaiting her recovery.
	   Barrow had time to chat with the local workers, who talked of
their love for music, especially Lucky Dube. That's when he got the
idea and opened an East African branch of Barrow Gordon in Kenya.
	   But putting the program together has not been easy, Barrow said.
	   ``We have been through every emotion under the sun to get this
thing done,'' he said. ``Sometimes we don't know whether to laugh
or cry.''
	   Barrow said international sponsors led by Guinness financed the
brunt of expenses, although he would not say how much the show
would cost, what the artists were being paid, or how much money had
been recouped in the sales of tickets for the all-day show
beginning 10 a.m (7 a.m. GMT) Sunday.
	   Main area tickets sell for Kenyan shillings 400 per person (dlrs
6) and VIP tickets cost shillings 1,500 (dlrs 25).

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ More and more Brazilians are
forsaking their beloved rice and beans in favor of beef, chicken
and beer, the government-institute of geography and statistics
reported Friday.
	   Between 1987 and 1996, Brazilians ate 11 percent less rice and
beans, 10 percent more beef and 21 percent more chicken.
	   Over the same period, beer drinking rose by 47 percent, due
largely to increased consumption among Brazil's poor, the study
said.
	   But in this country with one of the world's worst distributions
of wealth, that divide was equally evident at the dinner table.
	   While meat consumption among the poor grew by 4.4 percent, the
average poor person still consumed less than 2.2 pounds (1 kg.) of
beef month, the middle and upper classes consumed more than twice
as much, or an average of 5 pounds (2.27 kilograms).
	   The social divide was most evident in the case of cheese which
middle and upper classes ate 14 times more of than the poor. The
poll was carried out by visiting 16,013 houses. No margin of error
was given.
	   The study said the trends represented an overall improvement in
the diet of average Brazilians and attributed the change in eating
habits to improvements in the country's economy.
	   ___
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ A leader of Argentina's former
military junta accused of child kidnapping during the ``dirty war''
years was ordered held under house arrest.
	   Emilio Massera, 73, was detained last week and later moved to a
hospital for health reasons. He will be allowed home next week
following another scheduled court appearance.
	   Argentine law allows detainees over age 70 to be sequestered at
home.
	   A Naval admiral when the military junta took power in a 1976
coup, Massera is facing charges of kidnapping children born to
captives during the seven-year dictatorship. The babies were then
given to officials in the armed forces.
	   The children's parents were among those who disappeared from
1976-83, when thousands of political opponents, mainly leftists,
were tortured and killed by death squads.
	   Massera is the second former top official arrested this year.
Jorge Videla, a former army lieutenant general, was detained on
similar charges ealier this year. He is also under house arrest
while his investigation continues.
	   ___
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Civil Defense workers recovered the
body of a second drowning victim Friday in the Caribbean National
Forest, the only federally owned tropical rain forest preserve.
	   Authorities were able to recover the body of William Cruz a day
after he and Santiago Arce were swept away by a flash flood near La
Mina Falls, a popular waterfall in the forest, which is commonly
called El Yunque.
	   Noel Arce, also caught in the sudden wall of water, was injured
but survived. Two young women with the group, who were not in the
stream, went for help. Police said the five were modeling school
students in their late teens and early 20s.
	   Three days of nearly relentless rain have caused floods and
landslides around Puerto Rico this week.

Italian wins top European film award
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Roberto Benigni won best actor and best film
prizes at the European Film Awards on Friday for his acclaimed
movie ``Life is Beautiful.''
	   Benigni directed and starred in the film, called in Italian ``La
Vita e Bella.''
	   The film, which also won the Grand Jury Prize at the Cannes Film
Festival last May, is the story of a father who tries to shield his
son from the horrors of a Nazi death camp and convince him it is
all an elaborate game.
	   ``This prize for me is a demonstration of love,'' Benigni said.
``I don't know how to demonstrate my thanks for the amount of this
love.''
	   Best European Actress was a joint win for Elodie Bouchez and
Natacha Regnier, stars of France's ``La Vie Revee Des Anges,'' or
``The Dream Life of Angels.''
	   Sweden's Stellan Skarsgard won the European Achievement in World
Cinema Award for his appearances in ``Amistad'' and ``Good Will
Hunting.''
	   He beat illustrious competition from Antonio Banderas, Pierce
Brosnan, Gerard Depardieu, Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet.
	   ``I am very moved and nervous, but I won't go like this as
everyone else does,'' he said.
	   Adrian Biddle was chosen Best European Cinematographer for Neil
Jordan's Irish film ``The Butcher Boy.''
	   British actor Jeremy Irons was given the European Film Academy
Special Achievement Award.
	   Peter Howitt was named Best European Screenwriter for British
film ``Sliding Doors,'' starring Gwyneth Paltrow.
	   The Screen International Award for a non-European film was given
to ``The Truman Show'' directed by Australian Peter Weir.
	   The European Critics Award went to Serbian director Goran
Paskaljevic for ``Bure Baruta'' and the European Short Film was

Mitterwallner, starting 37th, wins super-G

<TEXT>
	   MAMMOTH MOUNTAIN, California (AP) _ Christiane Mitterwallner of
Austria, never better than 19th in four years of World Cup racing,
surprised herself and her heavily favored teammates Friday by
winning a women's World Cup super-G.
	   ``I was only hoping I could be in the top 20,'' Mitterwallner,
still visibly stunned, said. ``I never thought about winning,
never. Am I surprised? Sure, I'm surprised. I can't believe it.''
	   Renate Goetschl, who won two downhills for Austria last weekend
in Canada, was giving interviews and receiving handshakes and hugs
from the other skiers when Mitterwallner, 24, moved into the gate
as the 37th starter.
	   Skiing on a sun-baked course that remained fast throughout the
day despite soft snow, Mitterwallner caught everyone's attention
when she reached the midway point .20 seconds faster than Goetschl.
	   Mitterwallner crossed the finish line in 1 minute, 15.64
seconds, only .05 better than Goetschl, who was .04 better than
Germany's Martina Ertl.
	   ``The last part, I felt was not too bad,'' Mitterwallner said.
``The top, it was a little difficult to say if I was fast or
slow.''
	   Mitterwallner seemed confused by the roar that greeted her
arrival, then saw with unbelieving eyes that her name was atop the
leaderboard. She seemed almost ready to faint as she held her hands
to her head, then sank to her knees in the snow.
	   ``I must look two times,'' she said. ``Sometimes you dream about
it. I hope I can believe it in two hours.''
	   Since her start number was so late, Mitterwallner was still at
the bottom of the course when the race began. She watched Goetschl
and Ertl take the first two positions in the early going before
taking the chairlift to the top.
	   Mitterwallner, who uses the same brand of skis as Goetschl, said
she'd seen how well they worked in training. ``I knew I could do it
but a race is more difficult.''
	   Goetschl once won a super-G starting 34th and so she didn't take
victory for granted even after it appeared no skier remained who
could challenge.
	   ``Maybe I win the super-G; it's not over now,'' Goetschl said.
	   ``I feel really good about myself and my skiing,'' said
Goetschl, who had a super-G get away from her last weeke when she
missed a gate while leading.
	   ``It was a bad mistake and I was really disappointed,'' she
said. ``I tried to make up for that mistake today.''
	   Despite the almost tropical conditions following an overnight
storm, many late starters followed Mitterwallner's lead and punched
in startling results. Eight of the top 15 finishers started outside
the top seed, with the highest being No. 46 Katie Monahan of Aspen,
Colorado, who placed eighth. Another American, Megan Gerety of
Anchorage, Alaska, started 35th and placed 13th.
	   Some of the pre-race favorites finished well down the order.
World Cup overall points leader Alexandra Meissnitzer of Austria,
who won last week's first super-G of the season, settled for sixth
this time. Germany's Hilde Gerg, a former World Cup super-G
champion, was only 23rd.
	   Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg, a former overall champion, tied for
44th.

World Cup downhill canceled due to fog
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WHISTLER, British Columbia (AP) _ Heavy fog forced officials to
cancel the men's World Cup downhill ski race in Whistler, British
Columbia on Friday.
	   Organizers are hoping to hold the race on Saturday.
	   The venue has been plagued with weather problems. The event was
cancelled the last two years due to weather.
	   The race was originally scheduled for Saturday but fears of
deteriorating weather conditions prompted officials to take the
unprecedented step of moving it ahead one day to Friday.
	   Rescheduling the race to Friday cost organizers dlrs 100,000 in
television revenues, but organizers balanced the revenue loss
against persistent suggestions FIS would relocate the race next
season if it was cancelled for the third consecutive year.

Separatist lawmakers say Quebec should have sports team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ If Scotland can compete in international soccer
and rugby, Quebec should be able to field its own teams in ice
hockey and other sports, according to pro-independence lawmakers
from the province.
	   The proposal was made Thursday by the Bloc Quebecois, which
advocates Quebec's secession from Canada and holds 45 seats in the
federal Parliament.
	   The party's leader, Gilles Duceppe, cited the examples of
Scotland and Wales, which are part of Great Britain yet are allowed
to compete on their own in international soccer and rugby.
	   Duceppe said Quebec deserved similar special status to compete
in the ice hockey World Cup and possibly in other international
events such as the Commonwealth Games.
	   The federal government had no immediate response to the
proposal.
	   More than 80 percent of Quebec's 7.4 million people are
French-speakers, and there is broad support in the province for
greater autonomy. However, there has never been a clear majority in
favor of outright secession.
	   A Quebec ice hockey team would be competitive internationally;
several of the National Hockey league's best goalies are
Quebeckers. The province also produces many of Canada's top boxers,
free-style skiers and speed skaters.

Israeli warplanes raid guerrilla bases in South Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with another raid late at night, details
and background on previous attacks

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes twice attacked
suspected guerrilla positions in South Lebanon Friday for the
second day, Lebanese security officials said.
	   Also Friday, Hezbollah guerrillas wounded a pro-Israeli
militiaman in an attack on outpost of the South Lebanon Army
militia in the eastern sector of the Israeli-occupied zone, the
officials said.
	   In a separate incident, two Israeli soldiers and an SLA
militiaman were injured when they mistakenly opened fire on each
other in the occupied zone, an Israeli military spokesman said in
Jerusalem.
	   Two Israeli jets fired at least two missiles at targets in a
valley between the villages of Habboush and Arab Salim, five
kilometers (three miles) north of this southern market town, the
Lebanese officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   About midnight Friday night (2200GMT), Israeli fighter jets
fired two missiles in one run on a valley near the front line
village of Zillaya, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) northeast of
Nabatiyeh, the officials said.
	   The jets returned 10 minutes later to fire two more missiles on
suspected guerrilla gun positions in the same area.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the air raids.
	   The targeted areas are believed to be used by the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their allied
Lebanese militiamen in the occupied zone.
	   Israeli warplanes have attacked suspected guerrilla positions in
the south almost daily and guerrillas have launched scores of
attacks against Israeli and allied forces in the area since early
November.
	   Hezbollah guerrillas have been waging a guerrilla war to oust an
estimated 1,500 Israeli soldiers and their 2,500 allied militiamen
from the zone. Israel set up the zone in 1985, maintaining it was
necessary to protect its northern territory from guerrilla attacks.

Palestinians take next step to implement Wye agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Palestinian Cabinet statement, final grafs &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Palestinians on Friday took the
next step toward carrying out the land-for-security agreement even
though Israel has suspended implementation of the accord.
	   The PLO Executive Committee began preparing for a mid-December
gathering in Gaza City under the auspices of U.S. President Bill
Clinton. The meeting should confirm pledges that the Palestinians
no longer seek Israel's destruction.
	   However, a new crisis with Israel was already shaping up at a
time when the current one was still unresolved.
	   Under the Wye River peace agreement, the Palestine National
Council, the Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, and various
Palestinian groups are to meet on Dec. 14.
	   On that day, the PNC and the other groups are to ``reaffirm'' a
letter to Clinton in which Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
declares that clauses of the PLO founding charter calling for
Israel's destruction are null and void.
	   Israel has maintained that the PNC is required to take a vote by
a show of hands. The Palestinians have said the Wye agreement does
not call for a vote.
	   ``There will be no vote in this meeting,'' Zakaria Agha, a PLO
Executive Committee member, said after the Friday evening meeting.
	   After the PNC session, five percent of the West Bank is to be
transferred from sole Israeli control to joint jurisdiction.
	   David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, suggested Friday that there would be no
handover of land without a PNC vote.
	   ``It has been made clear that Israel will not withdraw troops if
the Palestinians do not adhere to their commitments under the Wye
agreement,'' Bar-Illan said. ``We will bring it up with the
Americans.''
	   As part of the Wye agreement, the Arafat letter listing the PLO
charter clauses in question is to undergo a three-stage process of
approval.
	   Last month, the 18-member PLO Executive Committee reaffirmed the
letter. On Dec. 10, the 120-member Palestinian Central Council,
which is comprised of senior Palestinian officials and legislators,
will approve the letter by vote, Agha said, citing Friday's
decision.
	   The final step is the PNC session at the Shawa Cultural Center
in Gaza City on Dec. 14. About 1,500 people will be gathered to
hear speeches by Clinton and Arafat. The PNC has more than 500
members, including many who live abroad. Also attending will be
members of various Palestinian groups.
	   The PLO Executive Committee asked the PNC chairman, Salim
Zanoun, on Friday to begin sending out invitations for the Dec. 10
and the Dec. 14 gatherings, Agha said.
	   Ahead of the Clinton visit, some 2,500 Palestinians jailed by
Israel for anti-Israeli activities prepared to launch a hunger
strike to press for their early release.
	   The hunger strike, to begin Saturday, will be accompanied by
protest marches and commercial strikes, all aimed at sending a
message to Clinton that the peace agreement cannot proceed until
the dispute over the prisoners has been settled, said Issa Karakeh,
head of the Palestinian Prisoners' Association.
	   The criteria for prisoner releases have become a major point of
contention between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
	   The dispute has contributed to the latest crisis which
culminated in Netanyahu's announcement earlier this week that he
was suspending the upcoming West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu said he would hold up the accord until Arafat dropped
plans to unilaterally declare a state next year and accepted
Israel's criteria for releasing prisoners.
	   During their meeting Friday night, the Palestinian Cabinet noted
American disapproval of Israel's action while reaffirming their own
intention to keep to the schedule stipulated by the Wye Accord.
	   ``The Palestinian leadership,'' a cabinet statement read, ``will
continue for its part to implement the Wye Accord according to the
timetable especially since the American administration has clearly
rejected the Israeli conditions.''

Police `re-evaluating' murder-for-hire accusations against
</HEADLINE>
gymnast's father &QL; 
 &UR; By TERRI LANGFORD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Police are taking a second look at accusations
that the father of Olympic gymnast Dominique Moceanu was involved
in a possible murder-for-hire plot, officials said Friday.
	   ``The case has been re-evaluated and it is now considered an
open case,'' police spokesman Robert Hurst said. On Monday, police
had said there wasn't enough evidence to warrant an investigation
into the claims.
	   In court affidavits filed this week, the Olympian claimed her
father had hired a private investigator to track her comings and
goings.
	   She also said police officers informed her that her father had
negotiated to pay a hit man dlrs 10,000 to kill a friend,
32-year-old Brian Huggins, and Luminita Miscenco, 26, the coach
Moceanu credits with reviving her career.
	   A call to Katherine Scardino, a lawyer for Dumitru Moceanu, was
not returned Friday. There was no answer at Dumitru Moceanu's home,
and a call to his gym was not returned.
	   The alleged plot is the latest installment in the stormy
relationship between the 17-year-old gymnast and her parents, whom
she believes squandered her trust fund earnings in risky
investments. A judge declared Moceanu a legal adult in October so
she could begin taking stock of how her earnings were spent.
	   But since that time, the relationship between the 1996 gold
medalist and her father has disintegrated to the point that a judge
this week granted temporary restraining orders to Moceanu and her
friends, Brian and Marcy Huggins. The couple helped Moceanu move
away from her parents.
	   Although police won't discuss what new information has prompted
them to ``re-evaluate'' attempted murder allegations, Moceanu's
publicist and a former lawyer have said a secretly tape-recorded
conversation, purportedly between Dumitru Moceanu and a private
investigator solicited to perform the murder, had been turned over
to police.
	   ``He was recorded by the person he was talking to, asking him
(the private investigator) to do harm,'' Roy Moore, who represented
Moceanu in her fight to become a legal adult, said Friday.
	   A hearing next Wednesday will determine whether the restraining
orders should be made permanent.

Mitterwallner, starting 37th, wins super-G

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with additional quotes and background &QL;

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MAMMOTH MOUNTAIN, California (AP) _ Just what the World Cup
needed, another Austrian star.
	   Christiane Mitterwallner, never better than 19th in four years
of World Cup racing, became Austria's latest champion Friday by
winning a women's World Cup super-G from the 37th starting
position.
	   ``I always had trouble from training to the race. Now I know I
can win,'' the 24-year-old racer said after giving Austria its
fourth victory in eight women's races this season.
	   ``I thought I was better in giant slalom; now I guess I can't
be,'' she added with a sheepish grin.
	   ``I was only hoping I could be in the top 20,'' Mitterwallner,
still visibly stunned, said. ``I never thought about winning,
never. Am I surprised? Sure, I'm surprised. I can't believe it.''
	   Renate Goetschl, who won two downhills for Austria last weekend
in Canada, was giving interviews and receiving handshakes and hugs
from the other skiers when Mitterwallner, 24, moved into the gate
as the 37th starter.
	   Skiing on a sun-baked course that remained fast throughout the
day despite soft snow, Mitterwallner caught everyone's attention
when she reached the midway point .20 seconds faster than Goetschl.
	   Mitterwallner crossed the finish line in 1 minute, 15.64
seconds, only .05 better than Goetschl, who was .04 better than
Germany's Martina Ertl.
	   Mitterwallner seemed confused by the roar that greeted her
arrival, then saw with unbelieving eyes that her name was atop the
leaderboard. She seemed almost ready to faint as she held her hands
to her head, then sank to her knees in the snow.
	   ``I must look two times,'' she said. ``Sometimes you dream about
it. I hope I can believe it in two hours.''
	   Holding the winner's check for dlrs 37,500, Mitterwallner added:
``I'm believing it more and more every minute.''
	   Since her start number was so late, Mitterwallner was still at
the bottom of the course when the race began. She watched Goetschl
and Ertl take the first two positions in the early going before
taking the chairlift to the top.
	   Mitterwallner, who uses the same brand of skis as Goetschl, said
she'd seen how well they worked in training. ``I knew I could do it

	   Goetschl once won a super-G starting 34th and so she didn't take

	   ``Maybe I win the super-G; it's not over now,'' Goetschl said.
	   ``I feel really good about myself and my skiing,'' said
Goetschl, who had a super-G get away from her last weeke when she

the top seed, with the highest being No. 46 Katie Monahan of Aspen,
Colorado, who placed eighth. Another American, Megan Gerety of
Anchorage, Alaska, started 35th and placed 13th.
	   Monahan said the two-hour delay of the start, necessary so crews
could finish sweeping excess snow off the course, was a key for
her.
	   ``I didn't get up until 9,'' she said. ``I'm a sleeper; I work
better in the day.''
	   Some of the pre-race favorites finished well down the order.
World Cup overall points leader Alexandra Meissnitzer of Austria,
who won last week's first super-G of the season, settled for sixth
this time. Germany's Hilde Gerg, a former World Cup super-G
champion, was only 23rd.
	   Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg, a former overall champion, tied for
44th.
	   Jonna Mendes of South Lake Tahoe, California gave the United
States a third points-scoring finish, claiming 30th. Canada's
Melanie Turgeon, who would have started first in the race, withdrew
because of recurrence of the back pain that has plagued her since
the summer.
	   Meissnitzer, who also leads the super-G and giant slalom
standings, had her lead in the overall stndings trimmed a bit,
although she still leads Ertl 425 points to 303. Goetschl is a
close third overall with 294.

Iranian woman detained at airport, charged in Israeli Embassy

bombing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Argentina's Supreme Court charged
an Iranian woman Friday in the 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy
in Buenos Aires.
	   Police detained Nahrim Mokhtari at the Ezeiza International
Airport on the edge of Buenos Aires after she disembarked Friday
from a flight from Paris that was bound for Montevideo, Uruguay.
	   Mokhtari is the first person to be charged in the bombing, which
claimed 29 lives. The exact nature of her involvement was not
disclosed.
	   She was expected to appear later Friday before the Supreme
Court, which by Argentine law presides over cases involving foreign
embassies.
	   Mokhtari is the former girlfriend of Wilson dos Santos, who was
arrested last month in Brazil and is believed to have critical
information about the embassy bombing and a 1994 attack on a Buenos
Aires Jewish community center, which killed 85 people.
	   He has reportedly said he was aware of the plans through
Mokhtari, who he claimed had links to a terrorist group.
	   Argentine authorities had been pursuing dos Santos for over a
year.
	   Dos Santos has said he alerted Argentine diplomatic officials
four months before the 1994 bombing that the attack was in the
works. But he claimed officials didn't take him seriously.
	   Israeli and U.S. intelligence agencies have attributed both

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Supermodel Naomi Campbell was charged with
assault Friday for allegedly punching her former personal assistant
and hitting her in the head with a telephone.
	   Campbell is accused of assaulting Georgina Galanis at a luxury
hotel Sept. 9 while in Toronto to film a movie, police said.
	   Campbell was back in Toronto on Friday to face the charge,
accompanied by prominent Canadian attorney Brian Greenspan. She was
released on her own recognizance and is to appear in court Dec. 11,
police said.
	   Galanis, 39, also has filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit
against Campbell in New York that mentions the alleged assault in
Toronto.
	   Galanis, of Queens, New York, said in the suit that she worked
for Campbell for nine days beginning Sept. 1. She alleged that
while in Toronto in her last two days on the job, Campbell hit her
twice in the head with a telephone, punched her shoulder twice, and
grabbed her neck and violently shook her head.
	   Galanis's court papers said Campbell, 28, also struck her in the
neck and slammed her against a wall.
	   Campbell's spokeswoman, Marcia Horowitz, issued a statement
about Galanis' lawsuit: ``These charges are nothing more than an
attempt by a disgruntled employee, who was terminated for
unsatisfactory performance after just one week, to make money at
Naomi's expense. Naomi will vigorously fight these charges.''

Mexico to cut 1999 budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MONICA GUTSCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico will cut its 1999 budget projections
in the face of plummeting oil prices, finance officials said
Friday.
	   Speaking on customary condition of anonymity, officials said the
government plans to lower the estimated average oil price included
in the 1999 budget to between dlrs 9 and dlrs 10 a barrel from the
current dlrs 11 a barrel.
	   The export price of Mexico's basket of crude oil fell to around
dlrs 7.60 a barrel earlier this month, Energy Secretary Luis Tellez
said Wednesday.
	   ``We plan to review the estimated price of oil and therefore the
government believes it will receive less revenue,'' a government
spokesman said. ``We will be looking to work with Congress on how
to fill the gap.''
	   Oil exports account for about a third of government revenues.
	   Mexico reduced its programmed spending three times in 1998 as
oil prices fell sharply, eventually cutting about 3.6 billion
dollars from the budget, or 0.96 percent of the gross domestic
product.
	   The government also gradually reduced its average oil price
estimate for 1998 to dlrs 11.50 a barrel from an original estimate
of dlrs 15.50 a barrel.
	   Finance Secretary Jose Angel Gurria submitted the 1999 budget
proposal to Congress Nov. 13, calling it the most ``austere''
budget in 20 years. Spending allocated in the budget for government
programs is 0.5 percentage-points lower in relation to gross
domestic product than it was in 1998 after the three rounds of
cuts.
	   The 1999 budget aims for economic growth of 3.0 percent and
inflation of 13 percent, while keeping the fiscal deficit to 1.25
percent of GDP.
	   The budget also estimates average crude oil exports at 1.645
million barrels a day, unchanged from current levels. As part of a
wider agreement by oil producers, Mexico in June agreed to cut oil
exports by 200,000 barrels a day in an attempt to shore up flagging
prices.
	   Tellez said last month Mexico was willing to maintain that
export level to the end of 1999 from the current deadline of June
30, if members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, or OPEC, would do the same.
	   OPEC members failed to reach an agreement at their meeting in
Vienna in late November, sending oil prices to new lows.
	   Boston-based Cambridge Energy Research Associates estimates the
average price of West Texas Intermediate crude in 1999 at dlrs 13 a
barrel. Mexico's basket of export crude oil generally trades around
dlrs 3 to dlrs 3.50 a barrel lower.
	   Another OPEC meeting is scheduled for March 1999.

Carter: Watershed election 'democracy in its truest form'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Venezuela-Election &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANK BAJAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ The events that allowed a former coup
plotter to become front-runner in Sunday's presidential vote
indicate that Venezuelans are fed up with the status quo, said
former U.S. President Jimmy Carter.
	   ``I personally see the developments in Venezuela as a
demonstration of democracy in its truest form,'' Carter said
Friday.
	   He is heading a 40-person team of international election
monitors that includes former presidents Patricio Aylwin of Chile
and Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada of Bolivia and Nicholas Brady, an
ex-U.S. treasury secretary.
	   Also expected is a separate observer delegation headed by former
Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, now secretary general of the
Organization of American States.
	   ``Correctly or incorrectly, the people of Venezuela seem to have
lost confidence in the domination of the two major political
parties in the country,'' Carter said in explaining the meteoric
rise of Hugo Chavez, who as an army lieutenant colonel led an
ill-fated 1992 coup attempt.
	   Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole coalition won a plurality of
Congress in Nov. 8 regional elections _ a major setback for the
country's two traditional political parties.
	   Carter did not specifically mention Chavez, or his main
challenger, Henrique Salas Romer, referring to them only as
``independent candidates.''
	   But he said the rise of the independents and the uncertainty
surrounding the election were the reasons he and his team from the
Atlanta-based Carter Center were invited to observe Sunday's
balloting.
	   Carter said the election was the 18th his center will have
observed in 10 Latin American nations.

London cat stows away to Montreal in a suitcase
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Globetrotting Katie the cat returned home Friday
after a trans-Atlantic adventure that began when she innocently
nestled down in her master's suitcase in London.
	   The black and white Persian, who usually confines her travels to
her own back garden, made the 3,200-mile (5,150 mile) flight from
London to Montreal in John Pearson's luggage in the hold of a
British Airways passenger jet.
	   She was liberated when Pearson, a 40-year-old purser for the
airline, opened his case in his hotel room earlier in the week. He
didn't recognize the dishevelled animal at first, he said.
	   ``It was only when I picked her up to comfort her, that I
recognized it was my cat. I was totally shocked,'' he said.
	   ``Katie must have been in the bottom part of the suitcase which
is in two halves. She must have climbed into the deep half and must
have fallen asleep.
	   ``There was no danger of it being cold for her on the flight
because on the Boeing 777 the air is recirculated through the hold.
She had also wrapped herself up in a jumper (sweater) and big down
jacket, which is perhaps why I did not notice her.''
	   Katie made the return journey in a conventional box.
	   ``I think she has certainly used up one of her nine lives,''
Pearson said.
	   Now comes the boring part. Due to Britain's strict, anti-rabies
regulations, the cat will have to spend six months in quarantine.

A little pig's troubled return to market leaves Hollywood asking

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ One of the first hints of trouble with the
sequel to ``Babe'' came at a test screening in Anaheim Hills nearly
a month before the movie was to open.
	   People said the supposedly family oriented ``Babe: Pig in the
City'' was too scary for children, pointing to scenes of a goldfish
flopping around and gasping for life and a dog nearly drowning as
it dangles upside-down on a chain, just its head in the water.
	   Although some changes were made, the early troubles would prove
to be an omen: ``Pig in the City'' will probably go down as the
biggest box office disappointment of the year.
	   The film, which cost nearly dlrs 100 million to produce and
market, had an dlrs 8.5 million, fifth-place opening last week, and
little hope of any recovery this weekend. The weak opening
contributed to the ouster of Universal Studios chairman Casey
Silver and has left Hollywood wondering how things could go so
wrong.
	   Although there is some disagreement between the Australian-based
filmmakers and the studio brass in Hollywood, two factors appear to
have been critical: the movie's release on the most competitive
weekend of the year and the impression the film was too dark for
children.
	   ``This film was seen as a risk,'' said Paul Dergarabedian,
president of Exhibitor Relations Co., which tracks box office data.
``Any time you raise a red flag with parents, they're not going to
chance it.''
	   Despite the debate, ``Pig in the City'' actually opened to
nearly identical business as the sweet and gentle original. The
original ``Babe,'' however, remained strong for weeks as word of
mouth spread. The fear at Universal is that the sequel will do just
the opposite.
	   Actually, ``Pig in the City'' received some of the best reviews
of any movie this year. Critics hailed its inventive visuals and
incredible use of special effects.
	   But even the positive reviews noted the darker tone of the
sequel. It seemed to many critics that Babe had left the bucolic
wonder of the Hoggett farm and entered a disturbingly surreal city
out of a Fellini film, full of slapstick violence.
	   Universal officials declined to comment and Director George
Miller wasn't available for comment. His spokesman, Johnny
Friedkin, said studio officials had seen a script two years ago
that included some the scariest scenes, including Babe being chased
through the mean streets by a vicious dog.
	   He noted that the studio was well aware of Miller's grown-up
credits, including the violent ``Mad Max'' films and the depressing
``Lorenzo's Oil.''
	   ``You had to be mentally deficient to read the screenplay and
not see what was in it,'' Friedkin said. ``There shouldn't have
been any surprises.''
	   The original ``Babe'' was directed by Chris Noonan, but Miller
co-wrote it and co-produced it, just as he did with the sequel.
	   To be sure, the original ``Babe'' had its disturbing moments.
The pig's first lines in his sweet voice, as his mother is being
hauled off to slaughter, are heartbreaking: ``Goodbye, Mom.''
There's also a sheep being killed by dogs and Babe himself staring
down the barrel of a shotgun.
	   All agree, though, that Universal gave Miller too much freedom
to accomplish the nearly impossible: create a follow-up to one of
the most beloved movies of all time. Miller worked without studio
interference on the original ``Babe,'' which earned dlrs 63.7
million, and nobody wanted to tinker with his success.
	   Miller did almost all the work on the sequel in Sydney, halfway
around the world from Hollywood. With computer effects making
animals talk and multiple animal appearances being merged to create
seamless sequences, it was impossible to create coherent scenes
until well after the film was shot.
	   So it wasn't until Nov. 8, one week before its star-studded
charity premiere, that a complete print was shown at the test
screening in Anaheim Hills.
	   Industry sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that
on the basis of the focus group's responses, Miller shortened the
goldfish and near-drowning scenes, toned down the musical score and
reduced the screen time for Mickey Rooney's nasty clown. A second
screening days later brought a considerably better response.
	   But to make time for the extra editing, the studio had to cancel
the benefit premiere and a weekend media event, developments that
made national news. Suddenly, ``Pig in the City'' was branded as a
movie in trouble.
	   Meantime, the film was being released at perhaps the worst
possible time _ Thanksgiving weekend, and up against two strong
family-oriented films: Disney's ``A Bug's Life'' and Paramount's
``The Rugrats Movie.''
	   Some months earlier, studio brass debated whether to reschedule
the release of ``Pig in the City.'' They decided to stay the course
because of promotional deals, with products timed to hit store
shelves around the movie's release.

	   Here is a summary of news from The Associated Press. Stories
carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items below have
moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip _ Palestinians took the next step toward
carrying out the land-for-security agreement even though Israel has
suspended implementation of the accord. The PLO Executive Committee
began preparing for a mid-December gathering in Gaza City under the
auspices of U.S. President Bill Clinton. The meeting should confirm
pledges that the Palestinians no longer seek Israel's destruction.
Under the Wye River peace agreement, the Palestine National
Council, the Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, and various
Palestinian groups are to meet on Dec. 14. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Sinn Fein party leader Gerry Adams
warned that Belfast's peace accord ``could bleed to death'' if the
stalemate over forming a new compromise government is not quickly
overcome. Adams and moderate Catholic politicians blamed the
impasse on Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble, whom they
accused of misleading British Prime Minister Tony Blair during
negotiations that seemed to bear fruit, but fell apart hours after
Blair's departure Thursday. Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern had expected local politicians to have formed Northern
Ireland's new administration by now, and to have agreed terms for
the way that government shapes policy with the Irish Republic.
(NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   SAINT-MALO, France _ France and Britain agreed that Europe needs
a stronger, more independent defense policy to help it react more
effectively to international crises. In a joint statement, French
and British leaders said the European Union should have the ability
to act independently, using ``credible military'' forces. But they
added that European military forces would act in conformity with
existing alliances, in particular with NATO. ``It is vital for
Europe to have a stronger and more coherent force and voice in
international affairs,'' British Prime Minister Tony Blair said
after meeting with President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin in this Brittany port town. Chirac called the joint
declaration ``an affirmation of the European Union on the
international scene.'' (FRANCE-BRITAIN SUMMIT)
	   TUNIS, Tunisia _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he
wanted to resolve differences ``once and for all'' with Libya about
putting two suspects on trial for the 1988 Pan Am bombing over
Lockerbie. Annan, speaking to reporters on the eve of talks with
Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi, said a U.N. team ``has done
some good work on the Lockerbie dossier.'' ``We will try to resolve
some problems and to find solutions together _ once and for all,''
Annan said, referring to Saturday's talks. In an apparent bid to
distance the Libyan leader from a decision on the suspects' fate,
Egypt's official news agency MENA quoted official Libyan media as
saying Gadhafi was not in a position to sign an agreement to hand
over the suspects. (TUNISIA-ANNAN)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Kosovo rebels refused to accept anything
short of complete independence, rejecting a U.S.-proposed
settlement as new border shootings put dangerous strains on the
province's fragile peace. Escalating violence in Kosovo, including
a shootout Friday that killed a woman in the province's
second-largest city, has lent new urgency to American-led efforts
to get Serbs and ethnic Albanians to agree on a plan for Kosovo's
future. Thirteen ethnic Albanians have been reported killed this
week. But the Kosovo Liberation Army dealt diplomacy a setback by
declaring it would not accept any peace deal short of independence
_ dismissing recent signals that it was ready to support a U.S.
proposal. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ U.S. stocks rebounded Friday after a steep
decline on Thursday as a strong employment report provided fresh
evidence of the nation's economic resiliency. The Dow Jones
industrial average rose 136.46 points _ or by 1.5 percent _ to
9,016.14. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent
in November as strong holiday hiring at department stores and a
booming construction industry offset continued layoffs in
manufacturing. The seasonally adjusted rate, down from 4.6 percent
in October and September, was the lowest since April and May, when
joblessness fell to a 28-year low of 4.3 percent, the Labor
Department said Friday. Employers added 267,000 jobs to their
payrolls last month, the largest gain in three months. Both the
unemployment rate and the number of jobs added were significantly
better than anticipated by economists. They've been expecting the
world financial turmoil that started in Asia last year to cut more
deeply into the U.S. economy. (US-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian ruble sunk toward its lowest level
since a financial meltdown this summer, prompting Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov to warn Friday that the country's reforms are
being imperiled by its shrinking economy. Primakov's government
desperately wants to stabilize the economy as Russia heads into the
difficult winter months. But with President Boris Yeltsin
hospitalized and Primakov struggling to implement a recovery plan,
the economy is still foundering and susceptible to additional
shocks. Primakov stressed that the government was still committed
to market reforms and noted that it had not intervened to fix the
ruble rate or restrict the flow of dollars, as some had suggested.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   DUISBERG, Germany (AP) _ Thyssen shareholders Friday voted
overwhelmingly in support of a merger with their traditional rival,
industrial group Krupp, clearing a last hurdle toward creating
Europe's biggest steel concern. The vote _ 96,77 in favor _ did not
come as a surprise. Krupp shareholders approved the merger Monday
with a 99.97 percent vote. About 2,000 jobs will be lost in the
merger, due to take place in March. As Europe's fifth-biggest
industrial concern, the new Thyssen Krupp AG would rank behind
automakers DaimlerChrysler and Volkswagen, and electronics and
communications giants Siemens and Veba. (GERMANY-THYSSEN-KRUPP)
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Premier Costas Simitis resorted to a rare
civic emergency decree Friday to force customs workers to end a
strike that has dried up fuel supplies in Greece and left many
without heating oil. Simitis signed an order for a ``civil
mobilization,'' which allows the government to draft Greeks into
service during times of national crisis. Such orders are usually
reserved for times of war. The decree shows the determination of
Simitis' government not to give in to labor protests against
measures designed to earn Greece a spot in the European Union's
single currency group by 2001. The walkout by members of the main
customs workers' union was intended to force the government to back
down on plans to unify Greece's nearly 200 state pension funds.
(GREECE-STRIKES)
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The decision by the 11 European nations
adopting the new euro currency to cut interest rates effectively
launches monetary union one month ahead of schedule, while boosting
confidence in the historic project. Even Germany's finance
minister, who had been demanding such cuts for months, appeared
pleased Friday with the lower interest rates, nearly unified at 3
percent, which should give boost to slowing growth. ``This is the
right path, and I think now that we have a chance to avoid a
too-sharp drop in growth,'' Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine said
in Washington, before he met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin. (EUROPE-INTEREST RATES)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. and Canadian negotiators reached
agreement Friday to ease tensions over farm trade through
stepped-up monitoring of Canada's wheat sales and lower barriers on
American grain and livestock moving northward. The agreement stops
short of meeting the demand by some farmers and ranchers that
Canada limit what it ships to U.S. markets. But U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky said the agreement ``will help
solve many of the problems faced by grain growers, the cattle
industry, and pork producers.'' The United States will triple the
information it collects on imported Canadian wheat to determine
whether the grain is being sold below cost. U.S. farmers have long
claimed that the grain is being dumped in American markets. Canada
denies the charge. (US-CANADA-TRADE)

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria sealed its borders and riot police
were patrolling the major cities before Saturday's local elections,
a key first step in Nigeria's transition next year from military
rule to democracy.
	   More than 50 million people are registered to vote for 8,000
municipal government posts in the oil-rich country, Africa's most
populous. Nine parties have registered and three have fielded
candidates nationwide.
	   Although there was no sign of elections violence Friday,
authorities were not taking chances. More than 100,000 police
officers were sent to polling stations across the country.
	   It is the first vote since Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar outlined
his plan earlier this year to give power to civilians next May
after presidential elections on February 15.
	   Saturday's poll is a key test run. The national electoral
commission is inexperienced and the political parties have vague
platforms and are relatively unknown.
	   Any party that fails to pick up at least 5 percent of the vote
in 24 of Nigeria's 36 states will be eliminated from the ballot for
the presidential poll.
	   Abubakar, who took control in June following the death of the
late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, has promised the military will not
intervene in the transition.
	   Nigeria has a history of armed coups and military meddling in
politics. The country has been ruled by civilians for only 10 years
since independence in 1960.
	   Abubakar has also warned that parties which campaign on divisive
ethnic lines will be barred from the presidential poll.
	   Simmering ethnic tensions prompted authorities to cancel polling
in a number of towns and villages in oil-rich southwestern Nigeria,
including several communities near the oil port town of Warri,
about 200 kilometers (125 miles) southeast of Lagos, where fighting
between Ijaw and Itsekiri youths continued.
	   Elsewhere, thousands of police and soldiers were deployed in
major cities, including more than 9,000 riot squad officers aiding
regular patrolmen in the sprawling commercial capital of Lagos.
	   Nigeria's land borders were expected to be sealed by Friday
night to head off concerns that political parties might bring in
foreigners to vote fraudulently.
	   Abubakar was expected to appeal for calm in a national
television address later Friday evening.
	   Since official campaigns began last week, colorful ads promising
jobs and ethnic representation have quickly filled radio and
television airwaves and crowds of people have followed cars blaring
election promises on loudspeakers.
	   No firm favorites have emerged for the presidential poll,
although former military ruler Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo has sought
the leadership of the Peoples' Democratic Party, whose members also
include Nigeria's last civilian vice-president Alex Akueme.
	   Obasanjo, who came to power in 1976 after a failed coup attempt
took the life of military leader Gen. Murtala Muhammed,
relinquished power and retired in 1979.

Mexican telephone workers protest economic package

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ About 50,000 telephone workers staged a
two-hour walkout Friday to protest President Ernesto Zedillo's
proposal for a new 15 percent tax on telephone services.
	   The stoppage did not affect ordinary phone services provided by
the former government monopoly Telefonos de Mexico, but operator
and customer services came to a halt as phone workers across the
country rallied against the proposed new tax, saying it would hurt
the industry.
	   It was the first time in recent history that organized labor,
controlled for decades by pro-government unions, has used a
nationwide stoppage to protest government policy.
	   Zedillo's 1999 budget draft, presented to congress three weeks
ago, proposes several tax hikes, including a new 15-percent levy on
telephone services in addition to the existing 15 percent value
added tax.
	   Because the new levy would also be taxed, customers could end up
paying more than 32 percent in total taxes on their phone bills.
	   ``The impact on the telecommunications industry will be
deadly,'' said Francisco Hernandez Juarez, head of the National
Workers Union, a recently-formed independent union federation.
	   Speaking before hundreds of workers gathered at the company's
Mexico City headquarters, Hernandez said about 2.5 million
customers _ of which 1.5 million have defaulted on past-due
payments _ could cancel their phone service if congress approves
the measure.
	   About 9.6 million Mexicans _ 10 percent of the population _ have
telephone service.
	   A study released Thursday by Mexico's Autonomous Technological
Institute and a private consultancy group indicates telephone use
would likely fall 9 to 15 percent as a result of the new tax,
contributing to an overall economic slowdown.
	   Zedillo's budget proposal forecasts a 3 percent growth in gross
domestic product and 13 percent inflation for 1999. But the new
phone tax could shave growth by 0.5 percent and boost inflation by
2.9 percent, the study says.
	   The tax would fuel inflationary pressures by prompting
businesses to pass along the costs to customers, said Aslan Cohen,
one of the authors.
	   ``This is not about one sector,'' Cohen said at a news
conference. ``It's about the spill over effect that it could have
on the entire economy.''
	   Zedillo's budget proposes boosting taxes and the prices of
government goods and services to compensate for falling oil
revenues. Mexico depends on oil exports for slightly more than a
third of its revenue.
	   The budget draft has been harshly criticized by legislators _
including those from Zedillo's Institutional Revolutionary Party.
The opposition-dominated Congress has until Dec. 15 to approve or
reject the budget, or pass a modified version which the president
would not have the authority to veto.

Climbing the bell tower is worth the effort

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ It's a dark, twisted journey up narrow steps, past
thick walls. It's so quiet it's hard to remember that hundreds of
tourists are milling around below.
	   This stairway, leading to the peak of the Notre Dame Cathedral,
offers a behind-the-scenes look at the famous site and access to
one of the two bell towers.
	   About 500,000 visitors make the climb each year. Their reward is
a bird's-eye view of Paris and a face-to-face look at ``Emmanuel,''
the 13-ton bell.
	   On the way, an organ room and storage areas are the only
rest-stops.
	   Vacationers may be winded after the 380-step trek, but they
can't help but be impressed by the bell, dating to 1406. The bell,
operated by pedals that required the energy of eight men, hangs
from its original supports.
	   But today, technology has reached even to Gothic churches, and
``Emmanuel'' is now rung electronically.
	   A crawl space from the tower's lower level leads to an outdoor
walkway which visitors may circle. Looking down to see the flying
buttresses allows for an interesting perspective of the cathedral's
architecture.
	   Notre Dame was started in 1163 and still isn't finished. But
that's not unusual for Gothic cathedrals, often destroyed by war
and rebuilt, or renovated to eliminate flaws.
	   In Notre Dame's case, the never-ending work has been due to a
little of both. Begun by Bishop Maurice de Sully, he saw the
211-foot-high (64-meter-high) main structure to completion. But the
flying buttresses and the design of the facade were not added until
the late 13th and early 14th centuries.
	   Architect Viollet le Duc led Notre Dame through its final stage:
repairing the damage caused by the French Revolution and adding the
chimeras and gargoyles to the tower walls. The chimeras are purely
decorative, while the gargoyles were built to serve as rain
gutters.
	   ``That's the mistake Disney made in the film ('The Hunchback of
Notre Dame'),'' says Veronique Gailly, conservator of Notre Dame.
``They didn't realize that there's a difference between the two.''
	   Between the movie, rumors of tragic figures living in the bell
tower and stories of the bell being made of melted-down jewelry,
it's often difficult to distinguish truth from fiction when
speaking of the cathedral.
	   ``It's possible that bell-keepers or the poor have lived up in
the towers,'' Ms. Gailly says, ``because there is an independent
entrance from one of the rooms.''
	   Notre Dame has always played a part in Paris' political life;
the self-coronation of Napoleon I in the cathedral is a good
example.
	   Coronations were the pope's responsibility, but Napoleon decided
to change the rules. He took the crown from the pope's hands and
crowned both himself and his wife, Josephine.
	   Even in the 14th century, festivities were linked with Notre
Dame. The Festival of Madness often interrupted Mass with the noise
of the masqueraders and drunken crowds in the courtyard.
	   Former French President Charles de Gaulle celebrated victory in
World War II at the cathedral.
	   Finally, at Notre Dame, they take the advice of Victor Hugo:
``Whatever may be the future of architecture ... in waiting for the
new monuments, let's conserve the old ones.''

Adams warns Belfast accord `could bleed to death'

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Sinn Fein party leader Gerry
Adams has warned Belfast's peace accord ``could bleed to death'' if
the stalemate over forming a new compromise government is not
quickly overcome.
	   Moderate Catholic politicians joined the Irish Republican
Army-allied party in blaming the impasse on Protestant leader David
Trimble, who flew to Washington on Friday and denied any crisis lay
ahead.
	   Both Sinn Fein and moderate Catholics accused the Ulster
Unionist Party leader of misleading British Prime Minister Tony
Blair during negotiations between the north's Catholic politicians
and the Ulster Unionists.
	   The two groups appeared to have reached an agreement on Northern
Ireland's new multiparty administration, but it fell apart hours
after Blair's departure Thursday.
	   Blair and Ahern had expected local politicians to have formed
Northern Ireland's new administration by now and to have agreed on
terms for the way that government shapes policy with the Irish
Republic.
	   The agreement that fell apart Thursday specified that the
government would have 10 departments and that it would cooperate
with the Irish government on seven committees dealing with issues
like tourism, trade and cross-border waterways.
	   Both sides still expect to reach a deal along these lines, but
possibly not until January _ too late for the agreement's plan to
transfer power from the British government to local politicians in
February.
	   Seamus Mallon, Trimble's would-be Catholic colleague at the head
of the as-yet-unformed cross-community government, sharply rebuked
the Protestant politicians.
	   ``People did not honor their word. That's putting it as mildly
as I possibly can,'' Mallon told the British Broadcasting Corp.
	   Trimble accused Mallon's Social Democratic and Labor Party, the
moderate Catholic party, of ``presenting fresh demands'' after
Blair had left.
	   Trimble and Mallon's party leader, John Hume, will receive the
Nobel Peace Prize next Thursday.
	   In Dublin for a meeting with Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern,
Adams accused Trimble of ``playing a slow, long hand, seeking to
erode and dilute and hollow out the substance of this agreement.''
	   He said Trimble and his colleagues, ``when Blair was here, went
technically through the motions. And when he went away, they
unraveled them.''
	   ``I could not underestimate the seriousness of this impending
crisis,'' said Adams on Friday. ``The whole danger is that the
agreement could bleed to death.''

	   KOPRA RIDGE, Nepal (AP) _ Two birdlike voices warble in the
darkness, and what feels like a light breeze shakes the outer flaps
of our tent.
	   It is Gyanu and Sham, two of four Sherpas who take turns rousing
semicomatose Western trekkers from their mountainside slumbers with
cups of near-boiling tea.
	   ``Lena, Lisa,'' the young men sing out to my Canadian tent mate
and me. ``Good morning!''
	   Just minutes after the morning elixir is distributed, large
bowls of warm water are passed precariously through our front door
for a pre-breakfast sponge bath.
	   Faces and armpits washed, sleeping bags hastily stuffed and
duffel bags crammed with too many clothes and packets of trail mix,
we join our 10 trek mates at a long table and start scarfing down
porridge, scrambled eggs and piles of roti (unleavened bread)
served with organic peanut butter, ``trekking honey'' and orange
marmalade.
	   We sit atop 3,650-meter (12,000-foot) Kopra Ridge in the
Himalayas, buffeted by breezes tinged with ice and surrounded on
all sides by rolling hills and the razor-edged, snow-drenched peaks
of Annapurna South (7,219 meters, or 23,684 feet), Varahashikhar
(7,847 meters, or 25,745 feet), Tukuche Peak (6,920 meters, or
22,703 feet), and Dhaulagiri (8,167 meters, or 26,795 feet).
Straight ahead looms the Kali Ghandaki gorge, at 6,000 meters
(19,685 feet), the world's deepest.
	   Not a bad way to spend 18 days of your life.
	   A group trek is not what I had in mind when I first thought of
traveling halfway around the world, however. I was accustomed to
exploring islands and foreign cities by myself and usually
dismissed guided trips as overpriced commodities for helpless
(sniff) ``tourists.''
	   That was not the case with this trip, which provided a welcome
respite from tiring logistics while freeing me to pursue my
ultimate goal: total immersion in the spirituality, tranquility and
simplicity of rural Nepal.
	   I had no heavy load on my mind or my back: Ten porters carried
our food, clothing and equipment, while a staff of two cooks and
four kitchen boys prepared three daily meals and morning and
afternoon tea. An attentive guide took care of each day's itinerary
and made sure no one wandered off a cliff or alone into the
wilderness.
	   The out-of-the-way route devised by the company I signed up with
usually kept us far from other trekkers and tourist-saturated towns
(no mean feat in October, one of the two most popular months for
trekking).
	   We strolled through electric-green rice fields, wandered in
forests thick with bamboo and gnarled rhododendron trees, and
traipsed over high passes where eagles soared and hill after hill
rolled past like the waves of a limitless sea.
	   We shared our paths with yaks, water buffalo, donkeys, goats and
shepherds and entered hamlets not often visited by outsiders.
	   The salutations we received in these remote villages were
refreshingly untainted by the overexposure to tourists that is so
evident in larger cities such as Katmandu, where freshly arrived
guests are hungrily eaten up by peddlers, beggars and
self-described guides.
	   In Nangi, a village perched at 2,260 meters (7,400 feet), we
visited a school that is a two-hour climb for students and nearby
dormitories they built themselves out of wood, straw and aluminum.
	   At Chistibung (3,000 meters, or 9,840 feet), after we had spent
hours ascending through rain and leech-infested forests, a woman
welcomed us into a small stone hut where we shared a fire with
sizzling pots of spiced buffalo and rice.
	   The guide, porters, Sherpas and cooks who accompanied us taught
us Nepalese phrases, folk songs and dances while gawking with
amazement through our binoculars and zoom lenses.
	   Traversing tricky terrain with the skill of billy goats, the
Sherpas made a daylong, 800-meter (2,600-foot) climb look like a
walk in the park. Nonetheless, they always stopped to let us catch
our breath and didn't hesitate to take on an extra day pack when
someone's shoulders started to sag.
	   The porters, young men and women with flimsy rubber thongs on
their feet, strapped onto their heads and young backs duffel bags
that in most cases seemed to weigh as much as they did.
	   Despite the unreasonably heavy loads, they scrambled with
sure-footed coordination over tree roots, dirt paths and
rain-slicked boulders, almost always making it to camp first to
erect the tents and have our bags waiting when we arrived.
	   The talented cook staff had tea and cookies ready 30 minutes
after we arrived, and made hot soup when we got caught in rain
along the trail.
	   Dinners, served by candlelight in a dining tent or around the
table of a local villager, spanned the globe: Chinese chicken
stir-fry; spaghetti with spicy tomato sauce; mashed and diced
potatoes; chicken with peppers; Nepalese-style pizza; dried
buffalo; the traditional Nepalese daal bhaat (lentil soup over
rice); and fluffy poori bread.
	   Each plate was piled so high with protein and carbohydrates and
refilled so often we fell away from the table every night gasping.

	   The trekking company was fanatical about preventing us from
getting sick: Sherpas forbade us to touch so much as a teacup until
we had completed the ritual of ``washy washy,'' rinsing our hands
under iodine-treated water they poured from a large teakettle.
	   Treated water also was placed outside the toilet tent, while our
drinking bottles were filled several times a day with thoroughly
boiled water.
	   Our guide was a 29-year-old Nepali named Govind (pronounced
GO-vind). Quick-witted and sociable, he never forgot a name and
maintained an accurate mental roster of each person's pains and
progress.
	   My trek mates and I, meanwhile, formed a mini-United Nations,
hailing from Australia, Britain, Canada, Germany, Hong Kong, New
Zealand, Sweden and the United States. Refreshingly for me, I was
the only American.
	   It is certain that I would have encountered other trekkers had I
gone out alone with a single guide and porter, but I'm not sure I
would have formed bonds as tight as those that come from nearly
three weeks of sharing a dinner table, toilet tent and difficult
trails _ not to mention spare boot laces, Wet Wipes, batteries and
buckets of laughter.
	   While I can't vouch for other trekking companies, Peregrine
Adventures, the Australia-based company I signed on with, did
everything right.
	   Their staff secured our trekking permits, transported us to and
from the airport (Govind was there patiently holding up the
Peregrine sign when I landed in Katmandu at 5 a.m.), and made the
calls to reconfirm our return flights.
	   Admittedly, group trekking with a company like Peregrine will
cost you about dlrs 100 (about 6,600 Nepalese rupees) a day _ twice
as much as I was quoted by an individual guide in Katmandu.
	   In return for my money, however, I saved time and headaches
while reaping the benefits of camaraderie and the local culture.
	   My daily concerns? Lacing up my boots, applying liberal amounts
of sunscreen, topping off my water bottle and loading my camera
with film.
	   Not a bad way to spend 18 days.

	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ An Indian film about lesbian love and the
clash of traditional values with modern life has protesters
shredding posters and storming into theaters.
	   Indian movies usually rely on mushy tales of romance, with lots
of songs and endless dances. Producers say their audience wants
fantasies, not reminders of the drudgery and misery of their daily
lives.
	   ``Fire'' is different. It's the story of women in unhappy
marriages to two brothers living in New Delhi in what is called a
joint family _ the brothers, both their wives and their mother
under one roof. The sisters-in-law, seeking comfort, develop a
lesbian relationship.
	   The film tackles issues rarely addressed in India, including the
unhappiness of women in traditional families who are expected to
suppress their desires while serving their men and their elders.
Homosexuality also is rarely discussed in India.
	   Though the staid Indian Censor Board is known for a heavy hand,
it allowed ``Fire,'' with its scenes of two women kissing and a
brief full-frontal nude shot, to be shown uncut, in a decision seen
as a hint of new maturity in the Indian film industry.
	   ``Fire'' ran to packed houses for three weeks, causing little
more than raised eyebrows and a smattering of protests from social
organizations and women's groups.
	   Then the rightist Shiv Sena, a Bombay-based party, took notice.
	   Shiv Sena activists have stormed into theaters in Bombay, New
Delhi and other cities over the past week, trying to stop showings
of ``Fire.'' They call its sexual content an affront to Hindu
values.
	   As a result, all showings of the internationally acclaimed movie
have been suspended in Bombay, the heart of the Indian
entertainment industry known as ``Bollywood.''
	   Shiv Sena activists have used violence to get their way on other
issues as well. And with ``Fire,'' TV and newspaper commentators
have wondered if the controversy is as much personal as political.
	   In the past, Shiv Sena members have attacked movies made by
actors or producers critical of their leader, Bal Thackeray.
	   The left-leaning ideology of Shabana Azmi, the main actress in
``Fire,'' may have had something to do with the latest attacks,
media commentators note.
	   It's not India's first film controversy. Government censors held
up the domestic release of ``Kama Sutra'' for nearly a year. The
film, based on a 5th century book of aphorisms on pleasure written
by the Hindu sage Vatsyayana, includes nudity and explicit sex.
When it was finally released last year, with cuts, it ran to packed
houses. Scalpers sold tickets at twice the theater rates. Several
theaters ran ``women only'' shows. There were no street protests.
	   Earlier Indian award-winning films like ``Bandit Queen,'' which
included a horrifying rape scene, and ``Bombay,'' about the city's
religious riots, suffered numerous cuts before being shown at home
in India.
	   Bollywood is not taking the attacks on ``Fire'' quietly. A group
of prominent theater and movie figures signed a petition Friday to
send to the Supreme Court chief justice, protesting the campaign
against ``Fire.''
	   ``We have condemned the methods used by the miscreants and the
overt support they received from the state government. These
attacks must be stopped,'' director Mahesh Bhatt said.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ After slashing his wrist and taking an
apparent drug overdose, the man suspected of mailing out 28
potentially lethal letter bombs was charged Saturday at his
hospital bedside.
	   A magistrate briefly visited Colin George Dunstan, 43, a
disgruntled ex-Australian Tax Office employee, at Canberra Hospital
to charge him with one count of damaging property with an explosive
device, with intent to endanger life.
	   This relates to the explosion of a letter bomb Wednesday at the
Canberra mail sorting center, which slightly injured two postal
workers who were hit by bits of plastic shrapnel.
	   The magistrate ordered Dunstan to appear in court on Tuesday.
	   The owner of a Canberra suburban Budget Motel found Dunstan, who
had checked in Tuesday under a false name, sitting in the lobby
bleeding from one wrist and dazed by an apparent drug overdose on
Friday afternoon.
	   The motel owner, Les McCabe, drove Dunstan to the Canberra
Hospital emergency ward, where police soon arrived to arrest the
man they had been seeking nationwide since Tuesday.
	   McCabe, 63, said he had been too busy with his motel work to
watch TV or read the papers, so he was unaware that one of his
guests was the most wanted fugitive in the nation.
	   Dunstan had been on leave from the Australian Tax Office after
having an affair with a married woman co-worker in 1990 and 1991.
According to documents Dunstan later filed to sexual harassment
authorities and the Federal Court, the woman ended the affair, and
then alternatively tried to resume it and castigated him for only
wanting her sexually.
	   Dunstan blamed this episode for the breakup of his own marriage
in 1992; he took an overdose of pills at that time.
	   He apparently also blamed the tax office and various human
rights and equal opportunity officials for his troubles; the 28
letter bombs found so far were all addressed to such authorities.
	   The last bomb was found at a Sydney home Friday. They were all
mailed in small plastic boxes of the type used to ship five
computer diskettes.
	   But on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, while Dunstan was still
at large, Australia was gripped by panic over urban terrorism.
Various government and tax offices in Sydney Melbourne and Darwin
closed while suspicious packages were investigated, all false
alarms.
	   A Sydney-to-Melbourne train was halted and evacuated Friday,
also a false alarm.
	   ``It's a reminder that that kind of urban terrorism, I suppose,
is a modern day reality in every society,'' Prime Minister John
Howard said Friday on Melbourne Radio station 3AW. ``We've been
refreshingly freer of it than most other societies and I hope that
continues to be the case.''

 &UR; Awakening in Nepal: A refreshed mind and renewed perspective &QL; 
 &UR; By LISA J. ADAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Was it sleeping under a roof of stars instead of brick? Rising
at dawn instead of noon?
	   Or was it gawking at 24,000-foot (7,300-meter) mountains draped
in snowy slipcovers, marveling at the 12-foot (4-meter) wingspan of
a floating eagle, or being hypnotized by undulating waves of green
rice grass and yellow mustard flowers?
	   Was it what I gained or what I left behind that freed my mind so
completely in Nepal?
	   The answer may not be as simple as the feeling: a small door
opening in my mind, and a torrent of worries, dilemmas and general
angst gushing out until I nearly floated.
	   Trekking for 18 days in the Nepal Himalayas tripped a switch in
my brain, engendering a welcome transformation in my internal
programming from mental gymnastics to simple physical exertion.
	   Suddenly, the world in which I moved was simple. Time was
measured in footsteps, slow and steady, and each day's goals were
elemental: reaching the top of a hill, checking the grip of boot
soles on slippery waterfall rocks, avoiding buffalo dung and
stinging nettle, remembering to either walk OR look at the scenery.
(If we plummeted into a ravine, Nepalese army soldiers would have
to haul our bodies up in baskets, our guide, Govind, cheerfully
reminded us.)
	   Thoughts on most days were reduced to the level of sensory
perceptions: the hot-cold feel of sweat evaporating off my back
with each kiss of cool wind; the crunch of gravel and sucking of
mud underfoot; the dank-earth smell of rhododendron forests
dripping with Spanish moss.
	   The music of Nepal was in the throbbing cicadas, a cappella folk
songs, the roar and splash of wild rivers and waterfalls.
	   It rang out in the dull clang of cow and donkey bells and the
universal greeting of ``Namaste'' (NAA-MAS-tay - ``hello,''
``welcome'') accompanied by a gesture of prayerful folded hands.
	   My individual triumphs were small but immensely satisfying:
Scrubbing dirt-encrusted clothing by hand under the icy water of an
outside spigot, learning to use the hole in the ground that served
as the daily toilet without falling in or having thigh muscles give
out.
	   I didn't look in a mirror for days at a time, gave thanks for
the hard ground under my sleeping bag and actually enjoyed the
spine-tingling jolt of an ice-cold ``solar-heated'' shower.
	   I reveled in afternoons spent walking through clouds, nights
camped on ridges overlooking deep gorges and days spent scraping
the pen across the pages of my journal.
	   Yeah, a few leeches sucked my blood, and stinging nettle bit my
hand. I got a sunburn on my neck and the backs of my knees, and I
gingerly nursed blisters that ran the length of my big toes. I fell
on my butt and my back and my hands, and smashed my leg into a rock
after experiencing vertigo on a high pass that dropped hundreds of
feet on one side. I still feel the steep descents in my knees every
time I climb the subway stairs.
	   But I also experienced the exhilaration of dunking myself in a
cold, rushing river at the end of a hot day and sinking into deep,
down-filled slumbers every night.
	   On my way to the toilet tent at 3 a.m., I spied a sky teeming
with more stars than I thought possible, not the least of which was
a surrealistically large Milky Way that stretched like a gauze
rainbow from one horizon to the other.
	   At sunrise, I watched as fog parted like the curtain on a grand
stage to reveal the rocky spines of 21,000-foot (6,400-meter)
25,000-foot (7,620 meters) and 26,000-foot (7,925-meter) mountains,
some of the highest in the world.
	   Journeying to Nepal reawakened my curiosity, renewed a desire
for adventure and returned my ability to glean joy from life's
small details.
	   Back in New York, I find myself more focused, staring in awe at
the towering steel and stone skyscrapers, listening intently to the
splash of fountains in outside plazas and meditating upon the flute
melodies of the street musician.
	   At the same time, I now appreciate the true value of
good-quality toilet paper, the comfort of a modern commode and the
luxury of a hot shower.
	   I went to Nepal for a much-needed break and came back with more
gifts than I could carry: a refreshed mind, well-worked muscles and
a renewed perspective, not to mention a mellower way of looking at
life.
	   Getting away always renews the spirit; getting away to Nepal
enhances and enriches it.
	   I have one suggestion: Go.

	    &UR; IF YOU GO ...
	   GETTING THERE: Major airlines flying directly to Katmandu,
Nepal, from the United States are Singapore Airlines and Thai
Airways. Other carriers in Europe and Asia make connections with
the national carrier, Royal Nepal, or many of the regional airlines
that fly into Nepal.
	    &UR; ___
	   BEST TIMES TO GO: Fall (mid-September to November) is the most
popular trekking season because it is after the monsoon season and
features mostly dry, warm days and cool nights. But there are
benefits to trekking at other times of the year as well, except for
summer. Nepal has monsoons from late May through August.
	    &UR; ___
	   ENTERING NEPAL: Both a passport and visa are required, but the
latter can be obtained at airport customs upon arrival. (Bring U.S.
dollars.) Trekking permits also are required, but trekking
companies can take care of that for you.
	    &UR; ___
	   VACCINES: None is currently required, but several are strongly
recommended: hepatitis A, meningitis, typhoid (usually two shots a
month apart), tetanus and a polio booster. It's also recommended to
bring anti-diarrhea and stomach-upset medication. (Trekking
companies will provide a list of guidelines and suggestions.)
	    &UR; ___
	   TYPES OF TREKS: Trekking companies offer camping or lodge-based
treks. Both involve a guide, cooks and porters. They also can
design individual treks. Treks are often graded as easy, easy plus,
moderate, moderate plus, challenging, challenging plus,
mountaineering and mountaineering plus. Plenty of aerobic workouts,
long walks or other exercise are recommended as preparation.
	    &UR; ___
	   TREKKING COMPANIES: There are numerous companies based in
Katmandu and the United States, many of which are listed in the
``Lonely Planet'' guide book.

China puts computer user on trial in subversion case

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ China has extended its crackdown on
dissent to the Internet by trying a computer entrepreneur on
subversion charges for giving e-mail addresses to an on-line
pro-democracy magazine.
	   Lin, arrested in March, appeared in a closed courtroom with two
defense lawyers on Friday. Even his wife was barred. She failed to
arrive as planned to wait outside the courthouse, and may have been
detained by police.
	   The four-hour trial ended Friday evening, and the court could
take a week to issue a verdict, said defense lawyer Wang Wenjiang.
	   ``I'm afraid it doesn't look good for Lin Hai. I think he's
going to be found guilty,'' Wang said.
	   The Shanghai software company owner is accused of giving
addresses for 30,000 Chinese computer users to ``VIP Reference,'' a
pro-democracy journal published on the Internet by Chinese
dissidents in the United States.
	   Lin was charged in April with ``inciting the overthrow of state
power.''
	   Outside court, about half a dozen uniformed police and other
plainclothes officers watched foreign reporters, who were not
allowed inside the courthouse gate.
	   Wang said that after the trial, courthouse guards followed him
for several blocks.
	   The case is the first prosecution of its kind in the ruling
Communist Party's attempt to exploit the Internet commercially
while crushing attempts to turn the free-wheeling computer network
into a forum for dissent.
	   The government also is intensifying a crackdown against attempts
to set up an opposition political party. Two prominent
pro-democracy campaigners were arrested this week and accused with
a third dissident of endangering state security.
	   Chinese efforts to police the Internet include technology meant
to block access to sites deemed subversive or pornographic. Service
providers are required to register all users with the government.
	   Attempts to locate Lin's wife, Xu Hong, were unsuccessful.
	   A man's voice shouted ``Hang up! Hang up!'' when Ms. Xu was
reached on her mobile telephone Friday, and the line went dead and
afterward was switched off.
	   Reporters were shooed away from the semi-rural suburban
neighborhood where Ms. Xu had been staying.
	   A woman who neighbors said was Lin's mother became angry when a
photographer took a picture of the lane and tried to wrestle away
his camera.
	   When one man was asked whether police had warned residents not
to talk to reporters, he nodded his head yes.
	   Ms. Xu, who had appealed for an open trial for her husband, had
written to President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji asking for
their help, but said she received no reply.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Beijing expressed concern that the trial was
closed and urged China to ``fully respect international human
rights standards,'' spokesman Bill Palmer said.
	   The group Human Rights in China demanded Lin's release and
called the decision to put him on trial a ``blatant violation of
the right to freedom of expression.''
	   The group, based in New York, called his detention arbitrary and
noted the recent arrests of political activists.
	   ``These are a clear illustration that Beijing is taking no step
whatsoever in respecting fundamental human rights,'' the group's
director, Xiao Qiang, said in a statement.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ After slashing his wrist and taking an
apparent drug overdose, the man suspected of mailing out 28
potentially lethal letter bombs was charged Saturday at his
hospital bedside.
	   A magistrate briefly visited Colin George Dunstan, 43, a
disgruntled ex-Australian Tax Office employee, at Canberra Hospital
to charge him with one count of damaging property with an explosive
device, with intent to endanger life.
	   This relates to the explosion of a letter bomb Wednesday at the
Canberra mail sorting center, which slightly injured two postal
workers who were hit by bits of plastic shrapnel.
	   The magistrate ordered Dunstan to appear in court on Tuesday.
	   The owner of a Canberra suburban Budget Motel found Dunstan, who
had checked in Tuesday under a false name, sitting in the lobby
bleeding from one wrist and dazed by an apparent drug overdose on
Friday afternoon.
	   The motel owner, Les McCabe, drove Dunstan to the Canberra
Hospital emergency ward, where police soon arrived to arrest the
man they had been seeking nationwide since Tuesday.
	   McCabe, 63, said he had been too busy with his motel work to
watch TV or read the papers, so he was unaware that one of his
guests was the most wanted fugitive in the nation.
	   Dunstan had been on leave from the Australian Tax Office after
having an affair with a married woman co-worker in 1990 and 1991.
According to documents Dunstan later filed to sexual harassment
authorities and the Federal Court, the woman ended the affair, and
then alternatively tried to resume it and castigated him for only
wanting her sexually.
	   Dunstan blamed this episode for the breakup of his own marriage
in 1992; he took an overdose of pills at that time.
	   He apparently also blamed the tax office and various human
rights and equal opportunity officials for his troubles; the 28
letter bombs found so far were all addressed to such authorities.
	   The last bomb was found at a Sydney home Friday. They were all
mailed in small plastic boxes of the type used to ship five
computer diskettes.
	   But on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, while Dunstan was still
at large, Australia was gripped by panic over urban terrorism.
Various government and tax offices in Sydney Melbourne and Darwin
closed while suspicious packages were investigated, all false
alarms.
	   A Sydney-to-Melbourne train was halted and evacuated Friday,
also a false alarm.
	   ``It's a reminder that that kind of urban terrorism, I suppose,
is a modern day reality in every society,'' Prime Minister John
Howard said Friday on Melbourne Radio station 3AW. ``We've been
refreshingly freer of it than most other societies and I hope that
continues to be the case.''

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Argentina's Supreme Court has
charged an Iranian woman in the 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy
in Buenos Aires.
	   Police detained Nahrim Mokhtari at the Ezeiza International
Airport on the edge of Buenos Aires after she disembarked Friday
from a flight from Paris that was bound for Montevideo, Uruguay.
	   Mokhtari is the first person to be charged in the bombing, which
claimed 29 lives. The exact nature of her involvement was not
disclosed.
	   She appeared Friday before the Supreme Court, which presides
over cases involving foreign embassies. Her hearing was continued
until Monday and she was to remain in custody through the weekend.
	   Mokhtari is the former girlfriend of Wilson dos Santos, who was
arrested last month in Brazil and is believed to have critical
information about the embassy bombing and a 1994 attack on a Buenos
Aires Jewish community center, which killed 85 people.
	   He has reportedly said he was aware of the plans through
Mokhtari, who he claimed had links to a terrorist group.
	   Argentine authorities had been pursuing dos Santos for over a
year.
	   Dos Santos has said he alerted Argentine diplomatic officials
four months before the 1994 bombing that the attack was in the
works. But he claimed officials didn't take him seriously.
	   Israeli and U.S. intelligence agencies have attributed both
bombings to Iranian-supported terrorist groups.
	   A used-car dealer and four Buenos Aires province police officers
are in prison awaiting trial for preparing the van that police say
was used in the Jewish community center bombing.

Report Pinochet lawyers seeking to annul Law Lords ruling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Guardian newspaper reported Saturday that
lawyers for Gen. Augusto Pinochet are seeking to overturn last
week's House of Lords ruling against the former Chilean dictator,
apparently on grounds that the wife of one of the judges works for
Amnesty International.
	   The five-member Law Lords, Britain's highest court, ruled Nov.
25 that Pinochet does not have immunity from arrest, meaning that
he must remain in custody while Spain seeks his extradition for
killings and torture by his security forces.
	   The 3-2 decision by the House of Lords tribunal reversed a court
ruling that Pinochet's arrest Oct. 16 was illegal because he had
immunity under English law for actions taken as a foreign former
head of state.
	   The Guardian quoted unidentified Chilean sources as saying that
submissions sent to the Home Office by Pinochet's lawyers claim
that the position of Gillian Hoffman, wife of Lord Hoffman,
``questions the validity of the ruling.''
	   ``They are believed to suggest that Lady Hoffman's relationship
with Amnesty could give the appearance of bias,'' the newspaper
wrote.
	   Lord Hoffman was one of the three justices who voted against
Pinochet's quest for immunity.
	   The Guardian quoted a spokesman for the London-based human
rights organization as saying Gillian Hoffman was an administrative
assistant for Amnesty and was not involved in policy or in
campaigning on the Pinochet case.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared during Pinochet's 1973-90 rule after he overthrew
Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist.
	   Pinochet now must appear before Bow Street Magistrates' Court in
London on Dec. 11, the deadline by which Home Secretary Jack Straw
must decide whether extradition proceedings can go ahead.
	   Pinochet's best hope is that Straw will block the Spanish
extradition proceedings, which would mean that extradition requests
lodged by Switzerland, France and other countries also would likely
fall away.
	   If Straw gives the go-ahead, Pinochet faces a long battle
through the British courts against extradition.
	   Pinochet underwent back surgery Oct. 9 during a regular visit to
Britain and was arrested in his hospital bed. He later was moved to
a north London hospital, and on Tuesday was moved under police
escort to a rented house.

<TEXT>
	   NAGARKOT, Nepal (AP) _ On a trail so steep that in spots it
turned into stairs, we stopped at every bend to gape at scenery
that was at times serene, rugged and awe-inspiring.
	   Below lay terraced rice paddies engraved into the hill like
emerald corduroy. Houses of stone and thatch stood on the few
scraps of land too steep to farm. Above, the horizon was the
7,000-meter-high (23,000-foot-high) wall of the Himalayas, crowned
by the snowcapped peaks of Xixapangma, Dorje Lakpa and Langtang.
	   Then we got back on our bicycles and pedaled on, avoiding the
edge of the narrow, grassy track, where a drop of hundreds of feet
(meters) lurked.
	   Bicycling in Nepal sounds odd _ part of a Zen riddle, or a
setting for exotic slapstick. This Hindu kingdom sandwiched between
India and Tibet is known for Mount Everest, not flat, bike-able
scenery.
	   But below its celebrated mountains is a tropical Nepal of
grasslands and lush, densely populated valleys. Its 17 million
people rival nations many times larger in their ethnic diversity
and cultural vigor.
	   A rich, 2,000-year-old mix of Hindu and Buddhist civilization
has bequeathed a dazzling cultural legacy.
	   Every town has its must-see hilltop temples, fort, palace or
monastery in distinctive Nepali style _ brick with heavy wooden
roofs and elaborately carved doors and windows. Festivals are
explosions of color and energy that defy the daily struggle to eke
out a living in one of the world's poorest nations.
	   An increasingly popular way to reach these out-of-the-way spots
is the new breed of lightweight, knobby-tired mountain bikes, whose
shock absorbers take the sting out of rutted dirt roads and
rock-strewn trails.
	   A bike will liberate you from the tourist track of buses and
market towns, take you to villages accessible by paths too narrow
and steep for a Jeep and do it faster than you could on foot.
	   Agencies in Katmandu, the Nepalese capital, offer package deals
with bikes, lodging and guides. Prices run from dlrs 15 to dlrs 90
a day. Accommodations range from tents to luxurious lodges, and
often include a truck to carry cyclists' bags from lodge to lodge.
Possible itineraries include royal towns, wildlife parks or
destinations as remote as Tibet.
	   So if you're fit and you've had enough bazaars, temples and smog
in Katmandu, get a bike and head for the hills.
	   I recently did, embarking on a six-day extravaganza of great
scenery, good food and gracious hospitality with a pair of U.S.
computer executives. Our guide was a former Tibetan Buddhist monk
turned bicycle racer.
	   The route circled the Katmandu valley, offering a mix of
scenery, local art and architecture.
	   Other possible outings from Katmandu include a day trip to
Patan, a former royal capital packed with temples, sculpture and a
meticulously restored palace.
	   Or a single, 12-hour day of riding will get a determined cyclist
to Pokhara, a picturesque town beside Phewa Lake west of Katmandu
with a view of the Annapurna mountains.
	   On our trip, the first adventure was just getting out of the
cheerful chaos of Katmandu. We navigated around crowds of street
vendors, barefoot children, Hindu holy men and women carrying
immense loads on their heads.
	   Cows, regarded as holy by Hindus and allowed to wander freely,
lay in the sun chewing their cud. They ignored traffic that parted
around them as naturally as a stream around stones.
	   Outside Katmandu, our route became a path above fields where
farmers were threshing their rice harvest. By lunchtime, three of
us had fallen. Lesson: wear a helmet.
	   Lunch was on a bluff above the Katmandu valley. Children
gathered to watch us eat, poke at our bicycles and peek into our
knapsacks. Children became a high point of the trip. Struggling
uphill at the end of a hard day, nothing beats having a roadside
cheering section of Nepalese 5-year-olds shouting, ``Hello! Hello!
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!''
	   But whoever taught thousands of young Nepalese to say to
foreigners, ``Give me money, give me pen,'' should be trampled by a
water buffalo. Begging by children who just want to see what they
can get from foreigners has become so prevalent that forms filled
out by tourists bear a government message pleading with them not to
give anything.
	   On Day Two, we rode into Bakhtapur, another former capital of an
independent princedom before the warrior-king Prithvi Narayan Shah
united Nepal in the 18th century. With foreign help, its temples
and markets have been restored to their former royal glory. The
palace is a museum.
	   In the afternoon, we stopped at Changu Narayan, a temple to the
Hindu god Shiva reputed to be the oldest in Nepal, dating to the
2nd century. It also is one of the most beautiful, with a courtyard
filled with carvings and bronze ornaments and a spectacular view of
the rolling, green countryside.
	   We spent our second and third nights in the hill resort of
Nagarkot, hoping in vain to catch a glimpse of Mount Everest. No
luck. The mountain hid behind clouds the whole time.

	   By this point, the trip had hammered my legs into such great
shape that I almost didn't recognize them. I considered auditioning
for Joe Namath's old job modeling pantyhose.
	   Descending from Nagarkot, the rutted track is rugged enough to
train commandoes and so steep that we often carried our bicycles on
our backs. And yet this trail is the only link to the outside for
village after hillside village. Dairy farmers make the walk each
day into the valley, carrying 30-kilogram (65-pound) cans of milk
on their backs.
	   One of our riders made himself useful by whipping out an instant
camera and handing out impromptu family portraits. He drew the line
at the man who wanted a picture of each of his six children.
	   My companions liked nothing better than blasting down these
slopes littered with jagged rocks. I hung back, haunted by the
thought that anybody who went over the handlebars and needed more
than basic treatment would have to endure being flown out to
Bangkok or Singapore. Happily, none of us did.
	   Our trip was rated seven out of 10 for difficulty. I don't want
to try an eight. It might involve something really dangerous, like
land mines.
	   The rest of the trip took us through a series of tough but less
nerve-racking climbs, the town of Dhulikel and the hilltop Nama
Budda Temple.
	   At the temple, built by Tibetan monks outside Dhulikel, flags
bearing prayers inscribed in Tibetan fluttered in a breeze carrying
the sound of monks chanting their evening devotions.
	   Watching the shadows lengthen in the valley below, I had to
agree with former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who remarked after
leaving office that he was finally free to speak his mind and
declare Nepal the most beautiful place in the world.

	   The 25-year-old No. 1 Italian player came close to a miracle
victory before surrendering to pain and exhaustion and retiring at
6-6 in the fifth set of a five-hour marathon against Magnus Norman
at the Assago Forum.
	   A seemingly distracted Davide Sanguinetti then went out and
failed to put up a fight, losing in straight sets to Sweden's
Magnus Gustafsson.
	   ``It's not finished,'' Italy's non-playing captain Paolo
Bertolucci said after Friday's opening day of the best-of-5 final,
``but I had already said Sweden was favored when the score was 0-0
and now it's 2-0.
	   ``We don't need just one miracle, we need several.''
	   With Gaudenzi ruled out for the rest of the competition,
Sanguinetti was to take his place as Diego Nargiso's partner in
Saturday's doubles. That makes the Swedish pair of Nicklas Kulti
and Jonas Bjorkman the heavy favorites to wrap up their country's
seventh title.
	   Gaudenzi's retirement raised the question of whether Bertolucci
erred in deciding to go with a player who had shoulder surgery in
October. Gaudenzi had not played a match since helping Italy beat
the United States in the cup semifinals in September.
	   Gaudenzi disclosed after the match that he had been feeling some
pain in his shoulder during training earlier this week.
	   ``I decided to play because it was a Davis Cup final in Italy,
because I wanted to earn the team points,'' Gaudenzi said. ``The
pain became really bad in the middle of the third set. I could not
hit the ball properly. ... I could have won in normal conditions,
without a doubt.''
	   Italian team doctor Enzo Candela said Gaudenzi will undergo an
MRI Monday.
	   ``If the tendon strain is confirmed, Gaudenzi may undergo
surgery by the same doctor who already has operated on his shoulder
twice,'' Candela said.
	   Norman, who officially downed Gaudenzi by the score of 6-7
(9-11), 7-6 (7-0), 4-6, 6-3, 6-6 (30-0), gave the Italian creedit
for rallying from 0-4 in the fifth set.
	   ``I am sad for Andrea, but really happy to have come out with a
victory,'' Sweden's No.2 player said.

	   PALM HARBOR, Florida (AP) _ The teams of Kris Tschetter and
Steve Jones along with Chris Johnson and Steve Lowery shot
8-under-par 63s Friday to move into a three-way tie with Meg Mallon
and Steve Pate in the JCPenney Classic.
	   The leaders are all at a tournament record 15-under 127 after
the second round in the modified-alternate shot format.
	   Rachel Hetherington-Rocco Mediate and Catrin Nilsmark-Chris
Perry are at 65, followed by Dale Eggeling-Fuzzy Zoeller (66) and
Beth Daniel-Doug Martin (67).
	   ``I was a little jumpy because this format is a little out of my
comfort zone,'' Lowery said. ``I kept forgetting I was supposed to
go hit Chris' ball.''
	   The team of Annika Sorenstam and husband David Esch shot
even-par and is tied for 50th in the 52-team field at 1-under.

<TEXT>
	   BRANSON, Missouri (AP) _ There's something inviting about a big
hole in the ground, says spelunker Russell Stephenson. Most people
can't pass it by without at least poking their heads inside and
having a look around.
	   And then there are those who have to climb in and keep going,
sometimes for miles (kilometers), until they've seen every
stalagmite and stalactite.
	   The midwestern U.S. state of Missouri, with more than 5,000
documented caves, is the place to be for these folks. Stephenson, a
guide at Branson's Marvel Cave, is definitely one of them.
	   ``I guess it's the adventure of it, that part of going where
nobody else has gone before, if I can quote from 'Star Trek,'''
Stephenson says with a chuckle. ``I know that's part of my
experience, going some place where nobody has been and being the
first to see it.''
	   Still, caving the spelunker's way isn't everybody's idea of a
good time _ squeezing through narrow, unexplored passageways,
sometimes slithering on one's belly through mud in search of an
opening, and maybe getting lost down there like Tom Sawyer and
Becky Thatcher did.
	   ``It is very dangerous,'' Stephenson says. ``There is water down
there, and a passage can collapse.''
	   There are bigger caves outside of Missouri. But for sheer
numbers, variety and the opportunity to safely see everything from
Jesse James' hide-out to what was once a giant bat guano mine, this
part of the country can't be beat.
	   Says Kirk Hansen of Springfield's Fantastic Caverns: ``Some
people think if they've seen one cave, they've seen them all. And
that's just not true. Every cave is different.''
	   Fantastic Caverns, billed as the only drive-through cave in
North America, offers visitors a tram ride in and out.
	   Marvel Cave requires a good deal of walking downhill, since
visitors enter the cave from an Ozark mountain peak inside the
Silver Dollar City amusement park. From there, they head 20 stories
down, along twisting, turning passageways into the Cathedral Room,
the world's largest unsupported dome. But there's a train ride back
to the surface.
	   Along with the huge, beautiful formations called stalagmites and
stalactites that all the caves have, Meramec Caverns also boasts
the hide-out of Frank and Jesse James.
	   The Missouri outlaws are believed to have discovered the cave
when they fought for the South during the Civil War, using it years
later to elude authorities after bank robberies. Lawmen who
followed them to the entrance balked at going inside and never saw
them come out.
	   It's believed now that they divided the loot and swam an
underground river to another entrance.
	   When Marvel opened to the public in 1894, tourists had to walk
down a wooden ladder and bring their own lights. It closed soon
after for a lack of visitors.
	   At Fantastic Caverns, the first known explorers were 12 women
from Springfield who answered an ad from the cave's owner in 1867.
He wanted to know what was down there _ but not firsthand.
	   Marble Cave was named in the 1860s when its limestone formations
were mistaken for marble.
	   Miners who went into Marble Cave in the 1880s had no interest in
the formations, however. They were interested in the bat guano that
was said to be 25 feet (8 meters) deep in places and could be used
to manufacture gunpowder.
	   As they set about digging it out, the town of Marmaros grew up
around it. But with the supply exhausted by 1889, the mining
company and Marmaros quickly went broke.
	   A Canadian, William H. Lynch, bought the cave and, legend has
it, burned down what was left of the town.
	   In 1927, after Lynch died, his daughters Genevieve and Miriam
renamed the cave Marvel. In 1960, a replica of the old mining town
was built and named Silver Dollar City. Cave tours are included in
the price of admission to the attraction.
	   The state's caves, meanwhile, continue to be explored, even
those well-known. After the floods of 1982, for example, Meramec
Caverns was remapped and a 3-mile (5-kilometer) passageway leading
into a huge room was discovered. That portion is not open to the
public. But spelunkers short enough, thin enough and brave enough
to squeeze through made it to the room. And they saw something no
one had seen before.

Australian research vessel remains stranded in Antarctic ice
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ The Australian Antarctic research ship
Aurora Australis remained stranded in pack ice Saturday, with
experts unlikely to decide until next week whether it can return
home under its own steam.
	   Australian Antarctic Division director Tony Press said that even
if emergency repairs could be carried out on the craft's propeller,
special arrangements would have to be made to replace 20
expeditioners on Casey station in Antarctica
	   The icebreaker's propeller broke down early this week, leaving
it in pack ice about 85 miles (135 km) off Davis Station.
	   The weather is reasonable and Press said the 69 expeditioners
and 24 crew were in no danger.
	   He said as engineers continued to work on the problem, the
division and the ship's owners, P and O, were examining options.
	   The Aurora might be able to return to Hobart alone, it might
need an escort, or it might have to be towed.
	   However, it would not be able to complete its program, Press
said.
	   He said expeditioners could be changed over on Davis and Mawson
bases by the two helicopters the Aurora carries.
	   But Casey was beyond their range, and the relief for there would
probably
	   be flown into Davis, where they'd wait until the next voyage.

<TEXT>
	   SUN CITY, South Africa (AP) _ It's a generational war at the
Million Dollar Challenge.
	   Nick Price leads with a 9-under 135 going into Saturday's third
round, followed a shot back by fellow 41-year-old Mark O'Meara, who
scored a five-under par 67 Friday to move to 8-under.
	   Just behind them are two 20-somethings _ Lee Westwood (25) and
Justin Leonard (26) _ both at 137 for 7-under par
	   ``I wish I could have played like (them) when I was 20,'' said
O'Meara, winner of the Masters and British Open this year and 1998
PGA golfer of the year. ``Who knows what I could have done.''
	   O'Meara said he has improved with age _ less hard on himself,
more patient. ``It's not a life or death situation out there. As
you get older, you realized you're going to have some good days,
and some bad days,'' he said.
	   Price, who shot a 68 Friday, is defending champion at the
7,597-yard (6,947-meter), par-72 Gary Player Country Club course,
and 1993 winner with a course record of 24-under par. He sounded
like his age group.
	   ``I'm not going out there and worrying too much about what the
others are doing,'' he said of the elite 12-man field, which
includes another 41-year-old _ Bernhard Langer _ and 20-somethings
Tiger Woods, David Duval and Ernie Els in the dlrs 2.57 million
tournament. Els and Langer are at 5 under par, Woods 4 under and
Duval 1 over at 145 after two days. The grand old man, Tom Watson,
who turned 49 Friday, stands at 142.
	   Price pairs off Saturday with O'Meara.
	   ``It's going to be nice to play with another 41-year-old
tomorrow,'' he said.
	   The round of the day belonged to Westwood _ who was level par
Thursday _ with an 8-birdie 65, marred only by a 1 over 5 at the
opening hole.
	   ``I struggled with my putting yesterday. Now it's in shape,'' he
said. ``I thought it was going to be a long day. Then on the second
I fiddled around with my grip and ... had better luck.'' Westwood
said he raised his hands on the putter.
	   Price said Westwood doesn't show his age. The English star has
had a phenomenal year _ four European victories and two wins in
Japan just before Sun City.
	   ``He shows a lot more experience. He's got all the game,'' said
Price.

Report: Mitsubishi, Fiat to jointly develop RV
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Mitsubishi Motor Corp. and Italy's Fiat
will jointly develop a recreational vehicle for the European
market, a newspaper said Saturday.
	   Mitsubishi will supply the engine and chassis for the vehicle,
which will have a Fiat body and be sold under the Fiat brand name,
the mass-circulation Mainichi Shimbun said.
	   The companies hope to manufacture 35,000 units of the RV and
start marketing it next year, the paper said.
	   Fiat hopes to take advantage of Mitsubishi environment-friendly
technology through the tie-up, the report said. The companies were
unavailable for comment over the weekend.
	   Mitsubishi decided earlier this year to cooperate with Sweden's
Volvo to develop low-pollution engines.

A menu with 500 bottles of beer on the wall
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo NY309 &QL; 
 &UR; By JENNIFER JORDAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KRUMVILLE, New York (AP) _ Larry Erenberg is not a bartender who
grooves behind the bar or shouts ``Hey!'' when a regular walks in.
	   He is quiet, not given to crowds or flash. The Country Inn he
owns and operates is much the same. Subdued. Understated. It
doesn't even have a sign outside.
	   The address is way out on a country road in (don't snicker)
Krumville, a hamlet on the edge of the Catskill forest.
	   But those who find the place and venture in are rewarded. For
the bar is a beer-drinker's Shangri-La.
	   The Country Inn stocks and sells 500 ales, lambics and plain old
beers. Eleven on tap, the rest bottled.
	   ``I've never seen anything like it,'' says David Tart, a regular
since he discovered the bar more than 20 years ago. He fondly
recalls walking in that day and his surprise at seeing The Wall _ a
scoreboard-style menu listing all the beers.
	   ``I found it by accident, just driving through the back roads
here. For 10 years I sampled every beer he had.''
	   It takes at least that long, since the offerings are constantly
changing.
	   The beverages come from as close as nearby Woodstock and as far
as Vietnam. About 40 countries in all. Brews named White Moose and
Carib, the former a milk-chocolatey ale from New Orleans, the
latter from the West Indies.
	   There are two from Vietnam: Hue and 33. Bohemia from Mexico.
	   And one can participate in what's advertised as ``a tribute to
the Amazon River'' just by downing a malty Brazilian Xingu.
	   The low-enders such as Coors and Bud are dlrs 1. Bottles go up
to dlrs 12 each for a Belgian Trappist ale. (Yes, made by monks.)
	   Customers often say they can't find such a selection for
hundreds of miles (kilometers).
	   ``One of the best beer bars in the world in the middle of
nowhere,'' is how Fodor's travel guide describes the Inn.
	   Why are all these beers here, in the middle of this upstate
outback?
	   ``I call it missionary work,'' Erenberg says. ``I'm just
presenting a variety. Exposing people to new beers and new ideas.''
	   He brought novelty and entertainment to a town where Budweiser
was rare. ``I started with 35, which was pretty hard to come by
then.''
	   He was way ahead of the brew-pub craze. Nearly 25 years ago he
left his native New York City and his costume jewelry work, moved
to Krumville and started serving beer.
	   Today, Erenberg, 67, is bartender, bookkeeper, cheesecake-baker.
	   Erenberg's appearance bears a certain Hell's Angels chic:
leather vest, dark jeans, white beard worn long and fluffy, and
dark eyebrows untamed.
	   For a new customer, Erenberg is full of advice on the right
drink for every mood.
	   One of the more unusual is La Trappe. ``It's from Holland,'' he
says. ``From the only Trappist brewery outside Belgium. ...There
are only about six Trappist breweries in the world.''
	   He doesn't usually suggest the Dixie Brewery's White Moose,
though he keeps it on hand, and some customers call it their
favorite. ``It's very sweet,'' Erenberg says.
	   ``Would you like to try a cherry lambic?'' he says. It's a fruit
beer, tasting similar to a red wine, but sweeter _ and with a head.
He recommends it with his homemade cheesecake.
	   Erenberg talks a customer into trying the Braveheart Scotch Ale
from the Woodstock brewery. He describes it as smoky. To a
neophyte, it's a bitter, hair-on-the-chest experience.
	   By 7 p.m. on a Friday, the Country Inn is hopping: the pool
table taken, the jukebox playing Bruce Springsteen's ``Jersey
Girl.''
	   Several customers are milling in front of The Wall _ staring, as
if in an art gallery. It takes a while to view and appreciate all
the details of the menu, longer if you've already had a few.
	   A 20-something man in a ponytail and overalls orders a Berliner
Weiss _ a sort of beer cocktail _ for his woman companion sitting
at a nearby table.
	   With a smooth twist of the wrist, Erenberg pours raspberry syrup
and swills it around a glass before adding a German wheat beer.
	   The phone rings. It's the Woodstock brewer telling Erenberg the
annual batch of pumpkin ale is ready. A few customers are
intrigued. Nat, at Woodstock, says the spicy beverage, not a far
cry from Thanksgiving pie, is his best one yet.
	   Erenberg says it will be available at the Inn as soon as someone
delivers it.
	   ___
	   The telephone number for the Country Inn is (914) 657-8956.

	   TORONTO (AP) _ Supermodel Naomi Campbell was charged with
assault Friday for allegedly hitting her former personal assistant
in the head with a telephone.
	   Campbell, 28, is accused of attacking Georgina Galanis at a
luxury hotel Sept. 9 while in Toronto to film a movie, police said.
	   The model was charged at a detective bureau in Toronto on
Friday, accompanied by prominent Canadian attorney Brian Greenspan.
She was released on her own recognizance and will not have to
appear at the next scheduled hearing in the case, on Dec. 11,
Greenspan said.
	   Greenspan said Campbell, during the one-hour legal proceeding,
``dealt with the matter with good humor, grace and charm.''
	   Campbell denies the charge, he said.
	   In Canada, it is rare for a first-time offender to receive jail
time on an assault conviction.
	   Galanis, 39, also has filed a dlrs 2 million lawsuit against
Campbell in New York that mentions the alleged assault in Toronto.
	   Galanis, of Queens, New York, said in the suit that she worked
for Campbell for nine days beginning Sept. 1. She alleged that
while in Toronto in her last two days on the job, Campbell hit her
twice in the head with a telephone, punched her shoulder twice, and
grabbed her neck and violently shook her head.
	   Galanis's court papers said Campbell also struck her in the neck
and slammed her against a wall.
	   In addition, Galanis claimed Campbell owes her dlrs 1,461.54 in
back pay.
	   Campbell's spokeswoman, Marcia Horowitz, issued a statement
about Galanis' lawsuit: ``These charges are nothing more than an
attempt by a disgruntled employee, who was terminated for
unsatisfactory performance after just one week, to make money at
Naomi's expense. Naomi will vigorously fight these charges.''

Australian research vessel remains stranded in Antarctic ice
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ The Australian Antarctic research ship
Aurora Australis remained stranded in pack ice Saturday, with
experts unlikely to decide until next week whether it can return
home under its own steam.
	   Australian Antarctic Division director Tony Press said that even
if emergency repairs could be carried out on the craft's propeller,
special arrangements would have to be made to replace 20
expeditioners on Casey station in Antarctica
	   The icebreaker's propeller broke down early this week, leaving
it in pack ice about 85 miles (135 km) off Davis Station.
	   The weather is reasonable and Press said the 69 expeditioners
and 24 crew were in no danger.
	   He said as engineers continued to work on the problem, the
division and the ship's owners, P and O, were examining options.
	   The Aurora might be able to return to Hobart alone, it might
need an escort, or it might have to be towed.
	   However, it would not be able to complete its program, Press
said.
	   He said expeditioners could be changed over on Davis and Mawson
bases by the two helicopters the Aurora carries.
	   But Casey was beyond their range, and the relief for there would
probably be flown into Davis, where they'd wait until the next
voyage.

Beepers ready, big wave surfers wait for call for controversial
</HEADLINE>
contest &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HALF MOON BAY, California (AP) _ An 18-foot (5.5-meter),
surfboard-snapping killer wave smashes against the reef. Out of the
icy bedlam scrambles Jeff Clark, his wetsuit steaming from his body
heat.
	   ``It's really not big enough yet,'' the surfer says, as another
towering wave roars in behind him. ``It's going to get better. It
always does.''
	   Maverick's, as this once-secret surfing spot in Northern
California is called, can do a lot better than an 18-foot
(5.5-meter) wave. Surfers risk their lives riding waves that can
rise up to three stories, break with unpredictable fury onto rocks
known as The Boneyard, and pin them underwater for minutes.
	   It is here that one of the most extreme surfing contests in the
world is about to begin.
	   A select group of surfers with beepers is waiting for Clark, the
acknowledged king of Maverick's, to decide when the perfect swell
arrives and the contest begins.
	   Some worry the competition will lead to tragedy. They fear it
will attract amateurs to waves that have defeated the world's top
surfers, including Hawaiian Mark Foo, who belly-flopped off his
board and drowned in 1994.
	   ``We're kind of worried that every yahoo with a surfboard is
going to come out and try to ride the monster waves that killed
Foo,'' said Deputy Harbormaster Dave Lewis.
	   Community pressure led to the cancellation of a larger
promotional event that would have been open to any professional
surfer.
	   Although the waves reach more than 50 feet (15 meters) during
winter storms, surfing the biggest ones would be suicide. That's
why organizers chose Clark _ who has surfed Maverick's for more
than 20 years _ to pick a day when the waves are clean and
rideable, not the furious building-sized walls of water that have
made Maverick's infamous.
	   The perfect day will occur sometime between now and New Year's
Day and will bring ``steady, 20-foot (6-meter) glassy waves and
sunshine,'' Clark said.

 &UR; Poconos win competition for tourists over rival Catskills
	   STROUDSBURG, Pennsylvania (AP) _ The dlrs 1-billion-a-year
tourism business in the Pocono Mountains has seen double-digit
growth in 1998.
	   ``This is the best year we've had in the 1990s,'' says Robert
Uguccioni, executive director of the Pocono Mountains Vacation
Bureau.
	   But times are not so good in the Catskills some 75 miles (120
kilometers) to the northeast, which has long competed with the
Poconos for the same tourists from New York, New Jersey,
Philadelphia and beyond.
	   It was once thought that legalized casino gambling was the cure
for all the economic ills in both the Poconos and the Catskills. So
when New York voters said ``no'' to gambling, many of the
Catskills' most famous hotels closed.
	   In the Poconos, officials kept their hotels open but closed the
book on their old marketing strategies.
	   ``We decided not to preoccupy ourselves with gambling and
traveled another path,'' said Robert Uguccioni, executive director
of the Pocono Mountains Vacation Bureau.
	   Resort owners in the Catskills held on to the promise of
gambling and only let go after a gambling referendum was defeated
last year. By that time it was too late. Hotels such as the
Concord, more than dlrs 20 million in debt, were forced to close
their doors.

 &UR; Mississippi wants to capitalize on cruise industry
	   BILOXI, Mississippi (AP) _ Tourists travel to the Mississippi
Gulf Coast by air and by land. Now what about water?
	   Gulfport Mayor Bob Short wants the port to become a home base
and stopping place for cruise ships.
	   He has appointed a group of casino and bank executives and
community leaders to actively seek cruise business, which he says
is a natural step in fulfilling the coast's slogan as the
``Playground of the South.''
	   They are undeterred by a failed cruise ship venture on the coast
in 1995, Short says. After just eight trips, cruises on a 512-foot
(156-meter) Ukranian ship were canceled.
	   ``We've got a lot of things we didn't have then _ casinos, jet
service, new hotel rooms, golf courses,'' Short says.
	   The Gulf Coast gets about 20 million visitors annually, but that
number is increasing as more resorts and golf courses open.
	   The latest project, the dlrs 650 million Beau Rivage casino
resort, will include 1,780 hotel rooms and 12 restaurants.

 &UR; Developers and residents battle over historic lighthouse
	   HAVRE DE GRACE, Maryland (AP) _ Havre de Grace officials are
going all out to draw tourists, but some folks say they are going
too far with plans to allow a restaurant adjacent to a historic
lighthouse.
	   A developer says a restaurant will help draw visitors to the
200-year-old Concord Point Lighthouse, one of the oldest
functioning lighthouses in the country, offering a place to enjoy a
scenic view of the Susquehanna River and Chesapeake Bay.
	   But opponents say the plan will spoil the tranquil beauty of the
place.
	   City officials have already spent dlrs 1 million on a half-mile
(800 meters) promenade facing the water, and have hired an economic
development coordinator. Coming next is a maritime museum next to
the city's Decoy Museum, which is a favorite for visitors.
	   ``Right now, as our city is growing, tourism has become very
important,'' says Mayor Philip J. Barker. ``Havre de Grace has
become a destination spot.''

Security Council calls emergency meeting on Angola
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With Angolan MiG fighters attacking a
rebel stronghold where U.N. peacekeepers are based, the U.N.
Security Council called an emergency meeting Friday and demanded an
end to hostilities and rebel approval to evacuate the peacekeepers.
	   The council backed Secretary-General Kofi Annan's appeal earlier
Friday to UNITA's rebel leader Jonas Savimbi to provide immediate
clearance for a U.N. aircraft to land in the UNITA strongholds of
Andulo and Bailundo to evacuate 14 U.N. observers.
	   ``This task has acquired additional urgency with the recent
intensification of military operations around the two team sites,''
Annan said in a statement from his spokesman.
	   UNITA's spokesman in Lisbon, Portugal reported Friday that
government forces were attacking Andulo, where 11 peacekeepers are
based. The Angolan government denied the report, but Western
diplomats said people on the ground in Andulo reported hearing
bombs.
	   The secretary-general complained that UNITA's leadership had
refused ``under various pretexts'' to allow the evacuation of
personnel from the U.N. Observer Mission, which is charged with
monitoring a 1994 peace accord between the rebels and the
government.
	   In a statement issued after the emergency meeting, the Security
Council said it was deeply concerned by a letter Savimbi sent to
the secretary-general on Thursday. In the letter, Savimbi said he
wants the observers to remain in Andulo and Bailundo to implement
the peace agreement.
	   Expressing ``grave concern for the safety and security'' of the
peackeepers, the council said it holds Savimbi ``personally
responsible for their safety, security and freedom of movement.''
	   On Thursday, the council extended the observer mission until
Feb. 26 and expressed dismay that Angola appears headed back to
civil war, which has ravaged the country for most of its nearly
quarter-century of independence.
	   The Security Council reiterated that UNITA was primarily
responsible for the escalation in hostilities. It demanded that
UNITA disarm and adhere to a 1994 peace accord with the government.
	   In his letter to the secretary-general Thursday, Savimbi
reiterated UNITA's commitment to the agreement.
	   He said it was imperative that Annan send his special
representative, Issa Diallo, to see him ``to find ways and means to
avert the imminent war breaking again in Angola.''
	   Under the terms of the agreement, UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym
for the National Union for the Total Independence for Angola _ was
to hand areas under its control to the government.
	   However, lingering hostility between the two sides has hindered
implementation of the deal, and no progress has been made since
June.
	   The civil war broke out following Angola's 1975 independence
from Portugal and some 500,000 people were killed in the fighting.

Who says the Cold War's over?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAULINE JELINEK
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ It sounds like America of the 1950s,
but it's Korea today _ talk of communist sympathizers, redbaiting,
destroyed careers.
	   Political science professor Choi Jang-jip is fighting for his
reputation and job amid an extraordinary, sometimes nitpicking,
media debate in which conservatives have labeled him pro-communist.
	   The Cold War may be over in most of the world, but the Korean
peninsula's still stuck in a deep freeze where spies and subversion
are considered constant threats. In this war, appearing radical can
still land you in jail on either side of the demilitarized zone
separating communist North from democratic South.
	   Choi's one of the latest casualties.
	   The 55-year-old Korea University professor's problems started
when November's issue of conservative Monthly Chosun magazine
excerpted his 1990 treatise about the 1950-53 Korean War.
	   Choi filed a libel suit, alleging the magazine maliciously
quoted the treatise out of context to make him appear
pro-communist.
	   ``In Korea, calling someone red is a serious attack,'' said
Choi, who considers himself a reform-minded liberal.
	   Chosun never actually called Choi a communist, or even
pro-communist. It called his views ``problematic'' and headlined
its story ``Mr. Choi's shocking interpretation of the Korean War.''
	   Koreans got the point. Reams of arguments for or against Choi
followed in local media.
	   Chosun's parent newspaper, Chosun Daily, with Korea's largest
circulation, quoted military veterans and other conservatives as
saying Choi was unfit for his appointment this year to a
presidential commission.
	   Liberal publications shot back, charging conservatives with
redbaiting and with threatening academic freedom and free
expression.
	   ``Witchhunt,'' One Nation magazine said in a 2-inch
(5-centimeter) red headline.
	   Academics in the United States called a press conference, saying
they respect Choi's work and find Chosun's campaign against him
``absurd.''
	   ``We are dismayed to see that Korea still cannot escape this
kind of black-and-white `cold-war' mentality nearly ten years after
the collapse of the Soviet bloc,'' said 22 professors from the
University of California at Los Angeles, Harvard, and other
schools.
	   And because of the controversy, prosecutors at mid-month began
studying Choi's work to determine if it ``benefits the enemy,'' a
crime under Korea's draconian security law. At least 240 people
have been jailed under the law this year, activists say.
	   Choi's paper would hardly raise eyebrows in most places.
	   But conservatives challenged such things as Choi's assertion
North Koreans suffered more in the war than Southerners. With an
estimated 625,000 Northern military casualties and 275,000
Southern, it's statistically true. But conservatives found it a
sympathetic thing to say about the North.
	   They also attacked Choi's use of the word ``historic'' to
describe the North's decision to start the war.
	   Choi said the word's a neutral statement of something
``important'' in history. Chosun said historic means something
``positive'' in history and thereby praises the North's invasion.
	   This wouldn't be happening to Choi, supporters say, if not for
his commission appointment by President Kim Dae-jung, himself a
former dissident.
	   The commission will advise Kim on policy toward the North, among
other things. Conservatives already are unhappy with Kim's
``sunshine policy'' of economic and social engagement with the
North.
	   A court late in November ordered Chosun to stop selling
November's edition while the libel case continues.
	   The judge backed Chosun's argument: the media has a right to
scrutinize whether ``a man in a position to affect government
policy believes in democracy.''
	   But, he added, ``There must be a limit when the news media
publish reports that aren't based on fact and may damage a person's
social reputation.''
	   In 1993 and 1994, two cabinet ministers resigned amid similar
conservative campaigns.
	   This year, South Korea's former spy chief was jailed for
plotting to destroy President Kim's candidacy a year ago by
claiming it was North Korea-funded. The plot fizzled, but South
Korea is so staunchly anti-communist that smear campaigns painting
candidates as pro-North have meant certain election defeat in the
past. They're called ``northern wind'' campaigns.
	   Still, Georgetown University Director of Asian Studies David I.
Steinberg says the fact Choi's case is being debated and taken to
court shows there's been ``profound change'' in Korea since the
pre-1988 democratic era when military governments told people what
to think.
	   ``In a perfect world there might not (be) any controversy over
past writings, but at least today we can engage in dialogue in
Korea,'' said Steinberg.
	   ``This is progress.''

Orioles sign DeShields and Surhoff, Tigers get Blair back
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ As George Steinbrenner spoke glowingly of Roger
Clemens, Baltimore and Detroit tried to do some catching up with
the World Series champions.
	   The Orioles plugged an infield hole by agreeing to a dlrs 12.5
million, three-year contract with free agent second baseman Delino
DeShields and re-signed outfielder B.J. Surhoff to a dlrs 14
million, three-year deal.
	   The Tigers brought back Willie Blair, acquiring the right-hander
in a trade that send infielder Joe Randa to the New York Mets.
	   And in some lesser deals, Houston re-signed infielder Tim Bogar
to a dlrs 1.1 million, two-year contract, Atlanta signed pitcher
Mike Remlinger to a dlrs 1.1 million, one-year deal and Toronto
signed outfielder Geronimo Berroa to a minor-league contract that
guarantees him dlrs 500,000.
	   Overshadowing all that was the Clemens chase. The five-time Cy
Young Award winner asked Toronto on Wednesday for a trade to a
contender or closer to home, and the Blue Jays said they will
comply within 7-to-10 days.
	   The New York Yankees, Houston Astros and Texas Rangers are
thought to be the top contenders.
	   ``I like him,'' Steinbrenner said. ``I like everything he stands
for. I like his work ethic, I like his combativeness. I like his
competitiveness. I like it all.''
	   The Yankees tried to sign Clemens when he was a free agent after
the 1996 season. Steinbrenner even went to Houston on a recruiting
trip.
	   ``I did my best to get him,'' Steinbrenner said. ``I don't know
whether he thinks he made a mistake. He certainly would have been
on a world championship team. I just didn't get the job done.''
	   Baltimore, trying to bounce back from its 79-83 record this
year, continued its remake. The Orioles added Albert Belle, Charles
Johnson and DeShields this week, retained Surhoff and lost Rafael
Palmeiro.
	   DeShields, who made dlrs 3 million this year, gets a dlrs
500,000 signing bonus, dlrs 3,666,667 next season and dlrs
4,166,667 in each of the final two years.
	   Surhoff receives a dlrs 4 million signing bonus and will get
salaries of dlrs 2.5 million in 1999, dlrs 3 million in 2000 and
dlrs 3.5 million in 2001. Baltimore has a dlrs 4.5 million option
for 2002 with a dlrs 1 million buyout, and the option would become
guaranteed is he plays in 120 games or has 372 plate appearances in
2001.
	   DeShields, 29, had a .371 on-base percentage and stole 26 bases
with St. Louis in 1998. Surhoff, 34, hit .279 this season and
established career highs with 160 hits, 22 homers and 92 RBIs.
	   Blair goes back to the city where he had his greatest success.
He was 16-8 with a 4.17 ERA for Detroit in 1997, winning 12 of his
final 16 starts.
	   After the season, he signed a dlrs 12.5 million, three-year
contract with the expansion Diamondbacks, but he was 4-15 with a
5.34 ERA when Arizona traded him to the Mets on July 31. Blair then
went 1-1 with a 3.14 ERA for New York.
	   Part of the reason behind the deal is money. Detroit assumes the
entire remainder of Blair's contract, which calls for salaries of
dlrs 3.5 million next year and dlrs 4.25 million in 2000.
	   Randa hit .254 this year with nine homers and 50 RBIs. He became
expendable when Detroit signed Dean Palmer to a dlrs 36 million,
five-year contract. The Mets may send him on to another team.

Quality, efficiency win Airbus customers and dent Boeing's market
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Airbus-Glance &QL; 
 &UR; By DEBORAH SEWARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Thanks to an Old World attention to detail and a
little luck, the days of lagging seem to be ending for Airbus
Industrie. But the European consortium still faces a stiff fight as
it tries to overtake its U.S. rival in the aircraft manufacturing
business, Boeing Co.
	   Airbus said Friday it has logged orders for 503 planes this year
_ including a first-ever sale to British Airways _ and now has half
the market for new aircraft orders, up from a third just a few
years ago.
	   Meanwhile, Boeing, which announced orders this year for 528
aircraft worth dlrs 35.6 billion this year, is hurting from the
Asian economic crisis. Several Asian airlines have had to cancel
orders for Seattle-based Boeing's long-distance jumbo jets.
	   Airbus, which won't release figures for the value of its
aircraft sales until early next month, has been lucky _ it hasn't
reported any cancellations for its wide-body A330 and A340
aircraft, and it was able to resell a canceled order for a dozen
smaller planes.
	   But the four-country consortium is also succeeding through
endeavor _ by becoming a master at producing classy short- and
medium-range carriers and, consequently, taking business away from
Boeing.
	   Norbert Burgner, editor-in-chief of Flug Revue magazine in
Germany, says Airbus is outdoing Boeing by consistently turning out
quality products and relying on new technology. Moreover, he said,
the European way of doing business _ which includes paying workers
well and hiring them for the long term _ has created a strong team
ethos and proved to be an advantage over the hire-and-fire policy
at Boeing, which is currently cutting 48,000 jobs.
	   ``There is more continuity in the process of making planes, and
that has an impact on quality,'' he said.
	   The extent of Boeing's problems became clearer this week. The
company, still in the process of undoing production snarls that
delayed deliveries and cut into its profits, announced that it
would have to cut 20,000 jobs on top of the 28,000 already being
slashed. Wall Street, uneasy about the company's future, sold
Boeing stock sharply lower.
	   But Airbus has its own challenges. Although orders for new
planes are split about 50-50, Boeing is expected to take about 70
percent of the revenue from actual aircraft deliveries. It also has
more money for research and development.
	   And Airbus has no jumbo jet to compete with Boeing's 747.
	   Airbus has developed proposals for a double-decker jumbo
jetliner, codenamed the A3XX jumbo, which could seat from 555 to
800 people. Chief executive Noel Forgeard said last month that the
consortium _ made up of France's Aerospatiale, British Aerospace,
Spain's Construcciones Aeronauticas and DaimlerChrysler Aerospace _
would announce plans for the A3XX early next year.
	   But there's no guarantee the A3XX will actually go into
production, partly because of Asia's economic problems. And Boeing
can be expected to defend its share of that market.
	   ``There is very little question that Boeing will come up with a
pre-emptive strike with a stretch version of the 747,'' said Paul
Nisbet, an aerospace analyst at JSA Research in Newport, R.I.
	   Airbus also must deal with internal dissent among its four
partners. DaimlerChrysler Aerospace and British Aerospace have been
upset that Aerospatiale has not made more progress toward becoming
a private company. To develop new models, Airbus must be able to
raise more capital than the state-owned Aerospatiale is able to get
from the French government.

North Korea says no progress in talks with United States
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ North Korea reported no progress Friday in
talks with the United States over a suspected nuclear weapons site
in the communist nation.
	   The talks were scheduled to resume Saturday at the U.S. Mission
to the United Nations and to move to Washington on Monday and
Tuesday, but there were no signs of a breakthrough.
	   The United States has rejected North Korea's demand for
compensation _ reportedly dlrs 300 million _ to inspect a large
underground construction site detected on satellite photos in a
mountainside at Keumjongri, about 25 miles northeast of the
Yongbyon nuclear complex.
	   North Korea's Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan reiterated that
the United States should pay for access to the site if it suspects
that it is being used to develop nuclear weapons.
	   Asked at the end of Friday's talks whether there had been any
progress, Kim replied: ``Not yet.''
	   U.S. Ambassador Charles Kartman, the chief American negotiator,
had no comment as he left the U.S. Mission.
	   After 12 hours of talks about the suspected site in the North
Korean capital, Pyongyang, last month, Kartman said there was ``a
rather wide gap between our positions.''
	   The Pyongyang meetings were a follow-up to talks in August on
missile proliferation, four-party peace talks, terrorism, and the
underground facility.
	   Under a 1994 agreement with the United States, North Korea
agreed to abandon its suspect nuclear weapons program. In return,
it is to receive two safe nuclear reactors worth dlrs 4.6 billion
plus substitute fuel oil and other economic benefits.

Taiwan chooses national Legislature, top mayors

 &UR; EDs: Will be led as developments warrant, polls close at 0800 GMT

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ After weeks of nasty campaigning,
Taiwanese turned out Saturday to choose a mayor for the capital and
a new legislature that will guide the island beset by precarious
relations with mainland China.
	   Attention focused on the tight Taipei mayoral race, where the
ruling Nationalist Party hoped challenger Ma Ying-jeou could unseat
the top politician from the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party, incumbent Chen Shui-bian.
	   While the campaigners talked mainly about tackling the urban
problems of Taipei, the underlying theme was that the winning party
would go into presidential elections 16 months later from a
position of strength _ and differing ideas on how to deal with
Beijing.
	   The Nationalists banked on citizens being scared by the DPP's
platform calling for a formal declaration of independence from
China _ seen as a potential catalyst for a military attack by the
mainland.
	   ``I have faced a very tough challenge in this race, but I am not
afraid,'' Chen told supporters shortly before midnight Friday. ``I
have no fear of China. What else should I be afraid of?''
	   Chen avoided mentioning independence in the campaign but his
camp has raised divisive questions about the loyalty of Ma, who was
born to parents from the mainland but moved to Taiwan when he was
just 1.
	   Election officials predicted heavy turnout among the island's
nearly 15 million eligible voters.
	   Businessman David Wu said he voted for Ma because of his ``clean
image.''
	   ``His support is unprecedented,'' Wu said. ``He must win or the
Nationalists' morale will be badly damaged.''
	   President Lee Teng-hui, who will retire in early 2000, quietly
cast his ballot along with his wife, Tseng Wen-hui, but he declined
offers to appear at polling stations with other candidates hoping
for some last-minute publicity.
	   The Nationalists were expected to maintain control of the
Legislature, which is being expanded to 225 seats. Voters were
directly choosing 176 of the legislators, and the remaining seats
were to be assigned to parties based on how many votes they get.
	   Voters also were choosing a mayor for the southern city of
Kaohsiung and city councils in Taipei and Kaohsiung.
	   Police guarded the more than 10,000 polling stations across the
island _ with huge barbed wire barriers on hand in some spots _ to
try to avoid repeats of violence that has marred past elections.
	   The outcome is being closely watched by Beijing, which claims
Taiwan as a part of China although the two have been politically
separated since a 1949 civil war.
	   Most Taiwanese want to maintain a separate identity from China
and put aside the issue of reunification or permanent independence
_ at least for now.

Head of Canadian inquiry into suppressed protests quits job
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ The man heading a politically
sensitive inquiry into police suppression of student protests quit
the job Friday, complaining of interference.
	   Gerald Morin was head of a three-member inquiry panel appointed
by the Public Complaints Commission of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police to investigate the Mounties' conduct during a 1997 summit in
Vancouver.
	   The panel, supposedly independent of the complaints commission,
was asked to determine whether police acted excessively when they
pepper-sprayed students protesting the presence of then-Indonesian
President Suharto at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting.
	   Many of the students contend police overreacted because they had
been instructed by Prime Minister Jean Chretien's office to break
up protests that might be embarrassing to Suharto.
	   Morin, at a news conference Friday, said his panel has been
subjected to ``improper interference'' from the Public Complaints
Commission. He did not elaborate on what he thought might be the
motive for the alleged interference.
	   Even before Morin's resignation, the inquiry had been plagued by
controversies and delays. Many of the principals have suggested the
effort be abandoned, and replaced by a judicial inquiry with
broader powers.
	   The controversy had been irksome for Chretien, who has refused
to call a judicial inquiry and repeatedly has insisted that Morin's
panel would be able to determine the truth.

Report: Sumitomo, Daiwa to tie-up with T-Rowe-Price
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Sumitomo Bank and Daiwa Securities Co. plan
to form an asset management joint venture in Japan with
Baltimore-based mutual fund T-Rowe Price, a financial daily said
Saturday.
	   The companies are also considering a joint investment banking
venture in the United States, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported.
	   The reported venture, which would be launched in April, comes as
Japan ushers in its ``Big Bang'' financial deregulation reforms
aimed at revitalizing the economy by allowing greater competition.
	   Sumitomo and Daiwa agreed on a partnership in the investment
banking business in July.
	   Daiwa and Sumitomo hope to benefit from T-Rowe Price's
international capital markets expertise, while the U.S. company
would be able to take advantage of its partners' extensive domestic
network.
	   The companies were unavailable for comment over the weekend.
	   Many Japanese financial institutions have been seeking alliances
with foreign companies or Japanese rivals to help them survive the
harsher business environment of the Big Bang.
	   Overseas financial firms are betting that deregulation will
allow them to tap into the country's mammoth pool of personal
savings, estimated at about dlrs 9 trillion.
	   Last month, Japan's Nippon Life Insurance Co. and Deutsche Bank
AG, Germany's largest bank, agreed to form a joint venture asset
management company.

Mexico to cut 1999 budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MONICA GUTSCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico will cut its 1999 budget projections
in the face of the steepest drop in oil prices in recent decades,
finance officials said. Mexico had already pared its budget to the
bone when oil prices began plummeting earlier this year.
	   The acknowledgment Friday that the budget may have to be trimmed
again is another setback for President Ernesto Zedillo, who already
faced heated criticism over austerity measures, tax increases and a
bailout of private banks that may cost taxpayers more than dlrs 67
billion.
	   ``We are working with congress to find ways to compensate for
the loss in public revenues, and at the same time make an efficient
attempt at austerity,'' Zedillo said Friday.
	   The Finance Secretariat announced that oil revenues ``may be 850
million to dlrs 1.7 billion lower than forecast'' in the 1999
budget proposal sent to congress three weeks ago, which projects
dlrs 102 billion in spending for 1999.
	   ``During the last month, the average price of Mexican oil has
fallen by about three dollars, and today reached dlrs 7.50 per
barrel, the lowest level in modern history,'' Energy Secretary Luis
Tellez wrote Thursday in a letter to Finance Secretary Jose Angel
Gurria, which was faxed to The Associated Press.
	   The original estimate in the 1999 budget draft forecast an
average oil price of dlrs 11 per barrel.
	   Oil exports account for about a third of government revenues.
	   Mexico reduced its programmed spending three times in 1998 as
oil prices fell sharply, eventually cutting about 3.6 billion
dollars from the budget, or 0.96 percent of the gross domestic
product.
	   The government also gradually reduced its average oil price
estimate for 1998 to dlrs 11.50 a barrel from an original estimate
of dlrs 15.50 a barrel.
	   Finance Secretary Jose Angel Gurria submitted the 1999 budget
proposal to Congress Nov. 13, calling it the most ``austere''
budget in 20 years. Spending allocated in the budget for government
programs is 0.5 percentage-points lower in relation to gross
domestic product than it was in 1998 after the three rounds of
cuts.
	   The 1999 budget aims for economic growth of 3.0 percent and
inflation of 13 percent, while keeping the fiscal deficit to 1.25
percent of GDP.
	   The budget also estimates average crude oil exports at 1.645
million barrels a day, unchanged from current levels. As part of a
wider agreement by oil producers, Mexico in June agreed to cut oil
exports by 200,000 barrels a day in an attempt to shore up flagging
prices.
	   Tellez said last month Mexico was willing to maintain that
export level to the end of 1999 from the current deadline of June
30, if members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, or OPEC, would do the same.
	   OPEC members failed to reach an agreement at their meeting in
Vienna in late November, sending oil prices to new lows.
	   Boston-based Cambridge Energy Research Associates estimates the
average price of West Texas Intermediate crude in 1999 at dlrs 13 a
barrel. Mexico's basket of export crude oil generally trades around
dlrs 3 to dlrs 3.50 a barrel lower.
	   Another OPEC meeting is scheduled for March 1999.

Palestinians take next step to implement Wye agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ With a new crisis in the works,
Palestinians have taken the next step toward carrying out the
land-for-security agreement even though Israel has suspended
implementation of the accord.
	   The PLO Executive Committee began preparing Friday for a
mid-December gathering in Gaza City under the auspices of U.S.
President Bill Clinton. The meeting should confirm pledges that the
Palestinians no longer seek Israel's destruction.
	   However, a new crisis with Israel was already shaping up at a
time when the current one was still unresolved.
	   Under the Wye River peace agreement, the Palestine National
Council, the Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, and various
Palestinian groups are to meet on Dec. 14.
	   On that day, the PNC and the other groups are to ``reaffirm'' a
letter to Clinton in which Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
declares that clauses of the PLO founding charter calling for
Israel's destruction are null and void.
	   Israel has maintained that the PNC is required to take a vote by
a show of hands. The Palestinians have said the Wye agreement does
not require a vote.
	   ``There will be no vote in this meeting,'' Zakaria Agha, a PLO
Executive Committee member, said after the Friday evening meeting.
	   After the PNC session, five percent of the West Bank is to be
transferred from sole Israeli control to joint jurisdiction.
	   David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, suggested Friday that there would be no
handover of land without a PNC vote.
	   ``It has been made clear that Israel will not withdraw troops if
the Palestinians do not adhere to their commitments under the Wye
agreement,'' Bar-Illan said. ``We will bring it up with the
Americans.''
	   As part of the Wye agreement, the Arafat letter listing the PLO
charter clauses in question is to undergo a three-stage process of
approval.
	   Last month, the 18-member PLO Executive Committee reaffirmed the
letter. On Dec. 10, the 120-member Palestinian Central Council,
which is comprised of senior Palestinian officials and legislators,
will approve the letter by vote, Agha said, citing Friday's
decision.
	   The final step is the PNC session at the Shawa Cultural Center
in Gaza City on Dec. 14. About 1,500 people will be gathered to
hear speeches by Clinton and Arafat. The PNC has more than 500
members, including many who live abroad. Also attending will be
members of various Palestinian groups.
	   The PLO Executive Committee asked the PNC chairman, Salim
Zanoun, on Friday to begin sending out invitations for the Dec. 10
and the Dec. 14 gatherings, Agha said.
	   Ahead of the Clinton visit, some 2,500 Palestinians jailed by
Israel for anti-Israeli activities prepared to launch a hunger
strike to press for their early release.
	   The hunger strike, to begin Saturday, will be accompanied by
protest marches and commercial strikes, all aimed at sending a
message to Clinton that the peace agreement cannot proceed until
the dispute over the prisoners has been settled, said Issa Karakeh,
head of the Palestinian Prisoners' Association.
	   The criteria for prisoner releases have become a major point of
contention between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
	   The dispute has contributed to the latest crisis which
culminated in Netanyahu's announcement earlier this week that he
was suspending the upcoming West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu said he would hold up the accord until Arafat dropped
plans to unilaterally declare a state next year and accepted
Israel's criteria for releasing prisoners.
	   During their meeting Friday night, the Palestinian Cabinet noted
American disapproval of Israel's action while reaffirming their own
intention to keep to the schedule stipulated by the Wye Accord.
	   ``The Palestinian leadership,'' a cabinet statement read, ``will
continue for its part to implement the Wye Accord according to the
timetable especially since the American administration has clearly
rejected the Israeli conditions.''

 &UR; Norman shoots even par Saturday &QL; 
 &UR; By DENNIS PASSA
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Greg Norman bit back at the course
that demolished him a day earlier, shooting an even-par 72 Saturday
early in the third round of the Australian Open.
	   Norman, teeing off in the third group of the day after nearly
missing the cut Friday following a 10-over 82 at Royal Adelaide,
was 2 over after the front nine Saturday but had three birdies on
the back nine.
	   They included 3s on each of the par-4 14th and 15th holes that
have caused him and other golfers so much grief this week. There
were seven triple-bogeys on each of the holes in the first two
rounds.
	   He had bogeyed 15, formerly a par-5, in both earlier rounds. His
three-round total of 8-over 224 leaves him 11 shots behind
overnight leader Paul Gow of Australia, who teed off early Saturday
afternoon in sunny, gusty conditions.
	   Norman and Fred Couples, who will both play in the Presidents
Cup next week at Royal Melbourne, scraped in on the cut of 8-over
152 on Friday, Couples after his second consecutive 76.
	   On Saturday, Couples had three back-nine bogeys, including on
15, en route to a 75, leaving him 11-over. His U.S. Presidents Cup
teammate, John Huston, had an 81 and sits at 16-over par.
	   Couples said a combination of jet lag and the toughness of Royal
Adelaide was responsible for his poor performance, but promised
better things next week at Melbourne.
	   ``My game isn't ready for this wind and this course,'' Couples
said. ``But I've had four rounds here, I'll play three practice
rounds at Royal Melbourne, and I'll be ready by Friday.''
	   Peter Thomson, who redesigned the Royal Adelaide course, will
also captain the International team for the Presidents Cup.
	   He said Saturday he was not concerned by Norman's 82.
	   ``That was an aberration,'' Thomson said. ``It can happen to
anyone.''
	   ``But I think he was too aggressive. I followed him around for
nine holes until I got sick of watching what was happening to
him.''

Cuban immigration to U.S. up, organized crime becoming more
</HEADLINE>
involved &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ The number of Cubans smuggled into the United
States nearly quadrupled this year as organized crime became more
involved in the immigrant trade, a U.S. official said Friday.
	   The number of Cubans reaching U.S. shores illegally increased
from 186 in 1997 to 732 in the first 11 months of 1998, U.S. Deputy
Assistant Secretary of State John Hamilton said following a
twice-yearly meeting with Cuban officials here.
	   ``There has been a definite shift from rafters to organized
criminal activities'' Hamilton said after the one-day meeting.
	   Smugglers increasingly use high-powered speed boats to bring
Cubans across the Florida Straights, leading U.S. authorities to
step up sea and air patrols across the 90-mile (145-kilometer)
stretch of water, Hamilton said.
	   Cuban officials did not comment on the talks, but Hamilton said
they didn't have any complaints about the increased patrolling.
Both sides recognize smuggling as a problem, he said.
	   ``Fast boats are harder to catch than rafts,'' Hamilton said
when asked why the patrols had not caught more of the smugglers at
sea.
	   Cuba has lowered the cost for processing legal exit permits from
an average of dlrs 700 in 1997 to about dlrs 500 in 1998, Hamilton
said, while the United States increased the number of non-immigrant
visas for Cubans from 5,361 in 1997 to 8,078 to date in 1998.
	   The U.S.-Cuba talks focus on immigration agreements signed in
September 1994 and May 1995. The United States ended a decades-old
policy of accepting most Cuban refugees rescued at sea, while Cuba
promised not to harass refugees returned by the United States.
	   ``Both sides are very happy with the progress of the immigration
accords ... (which have) have become closer and more effective,''
said Hamilton, who headed the U.S. delegation at the Friday talks.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Police have seized nearly 2 million U.S. dlrs
worth of pirated video compact discs, officials said Saturday.
	   Police officials stopped a boat off the outlying Tung lung
island Friday evening, seizing more than 500 cartons of pirated
VCDs worth 15.3 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlr 1.96 million).
	   Seven mainland suspects _ aged between 24 and 40 _ were arrested
and are being detained for questioning, a police statement said.
	   The discs were bound for mainland China, it added.
	   Hong Kong has come under international pressure, especially from
the United States, to do a better job of protecting intellectual
property. Washington has placed the territory on a watch list of
countries suspected of copyright violations.
	   Last year, customs officials seized 66 million Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 8.46 million) worth of counterfeit products and arrested
850 suspects.

World Council of Churches chief backs reorganization
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. &QL; 
 &UR; By RICHARD N. OSTLING &QC; 
 &UR; AP Religion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The World Council of Churches is
considering the most sweeping reorganization in its history to ease
a worsening split between the Protestant majority and Orthodox
minority, says the group's chief executive.
	   ``The ecumenical movement finds itself at a crossroads and in
urgent need of new orientation,'' the Rev. Konrad Raiser told the
group's 50th anniversary assembly on Friday.
	   Raiser's call for change came in response to growing Orthodox
disillusionment with liberal trends among the council's dominant
Protestant denominations, particularly in North America and Europe.
Disputed issues include homosexuality and the role of women in the
church.
	   ``We cannot, after celebrating this jubilee and affirming again
that we intend to stay together, simply return home and continue
with ecumenical business as usual.''
	   The growing divisions were underscored by a carefully framed
message to the assembly from Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of
Istanbul, the ``first among equals'' in the Eastern Orthodox
hierarchy.
	   Problems have long been building, Bartholomew wrote, but things
``took a critical turn'' when ``a series of liberal theological and
moral positions were adopted and brought into the life of the
council by a variety of member churches, mainly of the northern
hemisphere.''
	   Raiser conceded that Christian unity was ``being tested severely
by conflicts over moral issues, especially regarding human
sexuality.'' For example, the WCC's liberal Protestant wing will be
promoting gay rights at an open forum during the gathering,
although it is unclear whether the assembly itself will take any
action.
	   Raiser noted that while the Orthodox are one of two main
Christian branches in the WCC, alongside Protestantism, they are
``locked into a structural minority situation'' that's unlikely to
change since most new churches joining the organization are
Protestant. Of the two dozen denominations being taken into WCC
membership during the assembly, none is Orthodox.
	   For that reason, Raiser said, it was time to consider
``decision-making by consensus'' rather than the current
``governance by majority rule.''
	   While most Protestants run their affairs like parliamentary
democracies and so does the WCC, the Orthodox and many Third World
churches ``follow different models,'' he said.
	   Before Raiser spoke, Orthodox leader, Catholicos Aram I of
Lebanon's Armenian Apostolic Church, offered a sober assessment of
the situation.
	   ``Institutional ecumenism is in crisis,'' he said, adding that
``much of our constituency is disillusioned.''
	   ``The situation is, indeed, critical. Unless the assembly takes
this present situation seriously I fear that the Orthodox
participation will steadily dwindle,'' he added.
	   Membership already has dropped: A number of Orthodox delegations
are downgrading their participation in the assembly and two
national Orthodox churches have quit the WCC altogether.
	   One church has vowed to stay out of the Orthodox protests.
Catholicos Karekin I has said his church in Armenia will not take
part.
	   Meanwhile, South Korea's President Kim Dae Jung, a former
political prisoner, praised the Council for its support of
dissidents during ``all those years I was in agony.'' In the hall
were four Protestant observers from North Korea, the first ever
allowed to attend a WCC event.
	   The 960 delegates attending the assembly from 330 churches _ and
representing 350-450 million believers _ also heard a friendly
greeting from Pope John Paul II, head of the biggest church outside
the WCC.
	   The pope again declared his church's ``irreversible commitment''
to work for Christian unity.
	   Raiser urged the creation of a new, loosely knit ``forum'' of
churches and Christian organizations to serve as a vehicle for
closer links between the WCC and those outside, including Roman
Catholics, Evangelicals, Pentecostals and followers of younger
indigenous churches.

Lockout back on slow track; exhibition game announcement Monday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The waiting game began anew Friday in the
National Basketball Association lockout with both sides sitting on
their best offers for the foreseeable future.
	   ``If there's a frustrating part, that's it. They're just not
ready to do it yet, and we don't want to do it by ourselves,''
Danny Schayes of the Orlando Magic said as he prepared to fly home
following Thursday's fruitless 10 1/2-hour bargaining session.
	   When the pace will pick up again is anyone's guess. The sides
have promised to speak by telephone, but no contact was made
Friday, according to spokesmen for the league and union.
	   Agents Arn Tellem and David Falk will announce Monday that an
exhibition game will be played Dec. 19 in Atlantic City featuring
members of all four Dream Teams _ the 1992 and 1996 Olympic teams
and the 1994 and 1998 World Championship teams.
	   ``We are looking for alternatives beyond this game,'' Tellem
said. ``It's clear that as this lockout goes on that the timing is
ripe to create not only other games for players to make money, but
potentially another league. And work is under way in that regard.''
	   Falk said Michael Jordan's possible participation will be
discussed at Monday's press conference.
	   Commissioner David Stern has steadfastly refused to reveal when
the ``drop dead'' date is for losing the entire season, and he also
refused for a third time Thursday to allow a mediator to settle the
dispute.
	   The first month of the season already has been scrapped; the
second month is a lost cause. Even if an agreement was reached next
week, the season could not begin until the early part of January.
	   Owners indicated they could be flexible on phasing in timing
rules and changing a separate licensing agreement. Players made
concessions on the rookie scale _ giving owners a choice after
three years of keeping a player at scale for a fourth year or
invoking the right of first refusal. They also agreed to the
owners' rate of 200 percent for a backup tax that would supplement
the previously discussed escrow system in the final three or four
years of a six- or seven-year deal.
	   Owners still want the amount of revenues devoted to salaries
reduced to 52 percent for the 2001-02 season, and for players to
accept a maximum salary instead of a luxury tax on high-end
contracts.
	   Players are holding at 57 percent. They say they won't accept
changes to timing rules _ even if they are phased-in _ that allow
teams with salary cap room to sign another team's free agent and
then re-sign their own free agents under the Larry Bird exception.

TV delays results in World Cup downhill race cancellation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to update with quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WHISTLER, British Columbia (AP) _ Delaying the start of a World
Cup event to accommodate television audiences in Europe resulted in
the first downhill race of the season being cancelled when a thick
layer of fog shrouded the course Friday.
	   The race has been rescheduled for Saturday but the forecast
calls for snow flurries and more fog.
	   The race had been scheduled to start at 2:30 p.m. EST (1930 GMT)
so European television could show live coverage of a World Cup
women's super-giant slalom race at Mammoth Mountain, California in
prime time, then follow with this men's race.
	   Blue skies and bright sunshine greeted skiers when they
inspected the course in the morning. Even at 1 p.m. the skies were
clear, but the fog began to creep in about 30 minutes before race
time.
	   Whole sections of the Dave Murray course soon were blanketed in
a thick, blinding miasma that made racing impossible. Officials
delayed the start 2 1/2 hours, then scrubbed the race.
	   Canada's Edi Podivinsky was one of several skiers who said the
race should have been started earlier to take advantage of the good
weather.
	   ``This morning it was fantastic, perfect weather,'' Podivinsky
said. ``We could of had a start.''
	   Gunther Hujara, men's chief race director for the International
Ski Federation, said television's commitment to show the women's
race first made it impossible for the men to start earlier.
	   ``We had no race originally scheduled for today so we had to
respect the race for the ladies with their (earlier) start,''
Hujara said.
	   The men's race was originally scheduled for today but was moved
ahead to Friday because of a favourable weather forecast.
	   Ironically, the women's race in Mammoth was also delayed by
heavy snowfall. Eventually the race was held and Austria's
Christiane Mitterwallner won.
	   Hujara said that, because of television, the start time Saturday
will be 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT).
	   There's pressure on organizers to have a race at this Pacific
mountain resort. The venue has been plagued with weather problems,
forcing the cancellation of the race the last two years.
	   Podivinski said the Canadians are anxious for the race to
proceed since it's their only home-venue advantage of the season.
	   ``You always want to use what ever advantage you have,'' he
said. ``We feel very comfortable racing at home.''

	   HAINES CITY, Florida (AP) _ Allen Doyle, a member of three
Walker Cup teams, shot a 5-under 67 Friday and led all qualifiers
to earn a full exemption for the 1999 Senior PGA Tour.
	   Doyle finished with a 13-under 275 and won dlrs 30,000. Bruce
Fleisher, who played on the PGA Tour last season, was second at 278
and was one of eight players to get full exemptions.
	   Jim Thorpe and Howard Twitty, both former three-time winners on
the PGA Tour, tied at 284 and were among eight players to earn
conditional playing privileges.
	   Broadcaster Gary McCord finished in a six-way tie at 288.
McCord, Hiro Kazami and Tony Peterson won conditional privileges
while John Grace, Bill Thorpe and Bill Lytle were eliminated in a
playoff.

Thai police back down on beer ban at Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's police backed off a proposed
ban on beer sales at Asian Games venues after objections from
Danish brewer Carlsberg, a major sponsor of the event, local papers
reported on Saturday.
	   Nonetheless, police will restrict beer sales to booths outside
the stadiums, refuse entry to the events to anyone who appears
intoxicated and attempt to stop fans from bringing plastic water
bottles or other hard drinking containers into the venues, the
Bangkok Post reported.
	   Bangkok police had asked for the ban after arresting drunken
fans for throwing water bottles on to the field during a soccer
match between Hong Kong and Thailand earlier in the week.
	   Carlsberg has paid dlrs 10 million to sponsor the Asian Games.

Temperature at U.N. cools but heat is still on Baghdad
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Three weeks after Iraq narrowly averted
air strikes by promising to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors,
the temperature in the Security Council has cooled but the heat is
still on Baghdad.
	   Chief weapons inspector Richard Butler is in the process of
testing Iraq's promise, and the Security Council is waiting for his
report in mid-December to decide whether or not to launch a
comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   While council members are already quietly discussing the format
of a comprehensive review, the threat of airstrikes remains _ and
nobody knows it better than the Iraqis.
	   ``It could well end up in a comprehensive review, which I think
Iraq deserves, or it could end up in another crisis,'' Iraq's U.N.
Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon said Friday. ``Both options are open.''
	   The United States and Britain have threatened military action if
Baghdad does not cooperate fully with the inspectors and allow
unfettered searches for weapons of mass destruction. They have
deliberately not revealed what would trigger an attack, to get Iraq
to comply.
	   ``I think there would have to be a bit of blatant noncompliance
on their part, and they're just not doing that,'' said a Western
diplomat.
	   Butler said he will conduct the full range of inspection
activities, including surprise inspections, before reporting to the
council. Those no-notice inspections, which Iraq has resisted in
the past, could come as early as next week.
	   Former weapons inspector Scott Ritter, in an article for The New
Republic magazine to be released Monday, said surprise inspections
will fail because Baghdad has had time to shift documents and
materials to new, secret locations.
	   Iraq curtailed inspections Aug. 5, and broke off all cooperation
with the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which is charged
with eliminating its weapons of mass destruction, on Oct. 31. It
agreed to resume cooperation on Nov. 14.
	   Ritter, the former chief of UNSCOM's Concealment Investigations
Unit, resigned in August in protest over what he characterized as
Washington's refusal to allow hard-hitting, potentially
confrontational inspections.
	   In the magazine article, he said Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein has
outmaneuvered the United States again by forcing a confrontation
that ultimately led to the concept of the comprehensive review.
	   ``Once Iraq has established a record of compliance with these
now meaningless surprise inspections, the comprehensive review
process can begin,'' Ritter wrote.
	   UNSCOM must certify that Iraq has eliminated its nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons and long-range missiles before
economic sanctions imposed after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait
can be lifted.
	   Iraq see a comprehensive review as the quickest route to ending
sanctions. But the United States insists there is no link and
Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov, one of Baghdad's staunchest
supporters, agrees that a review will simply produce a list of
outstanding disarmament issues.
	   If the council agrees on a comprehensive review, diplomats said
it wouldn't begin until January.
	   Western diplomats said Baghdad has yet to demonstrate full
cooperation.
	   Butler has requested several documents relating to banned
weapons programs, but has received only one, an account of the
creation of a missile unit, an UNSCOM spokesman said.
	   Iraq also voluntarily submitted an analysis of chemical test on
missile fragments.
	   Iraq has agreed to cooperate with three inspection teams to
investigate the fate of 155mm shells filled with mustard gas; to
verify the disposal of R-400 aerial bombs equipped for chemical and
biological agents; and to look at pits where special warheads were
stored.
	   But, in a letter to the council dated Dec. 3, UNSCOM deputy
chairman Charles Duelfer said a U.N. inspection team could not
obtain access to a site because it was under the control of an
exiled Iranian opposition group. He said inspectors also discovered
some dual-use items that could be used to make biological weapons.

<TEXT>
	   Negotiators for the last band of guerrillas holed up near the
Thai border met Friday with representatives of the government in
Phnom Penh at Preah Vihear temple at the northern edge of Cambodia
and agreed to lay down their arms, according to Nate Thayer of the
Far Eastern Economic Review.
	   In 1997, Thayer became the first the first journalist allowed to
interview the Khmer Rouge's late leader Pol Pot, who had not been
seen in public in nearly two decades. He is one of very few
outsiders trusted by the guerrillas.
	   The surrender of the Khmer Rouge brings to an end more than 30
years of civil war in Cambodia that began with the Marxist
guerilla's insurgency against the government in Phnom Penh in the
late 1960s.

Sabres down Flyers 3-0; Devils tie Canadiens 1-1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be UPDATED with late games &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUFFALO, New York (AP) _ Dominik Hasek recorded his 37th career
shutout and Philadelphia center Eric Lindros was ejected late in
the first period as the Buffalo Sabres beat the Flyers 3-0 Friday
night.
	   Hasek made 31 saves and Geoff Sanderson, Darryl Shannon and
Brian Holzinger scored for the Sabres, who were outshot 31-15.
Buffalo is 7-0-1 in its last eight home games this season.
	   Lindros slashed Sabres defenseman Jay McKee and drew a game
misconduct with 43 seconds left in the first period. The penalty
left the Flyers shorthanded for five minutes, and the Sabres
unloaded six shots on the power play and scored for a 3-0 lead two
minutes into the second period.
 &UR; Canadiens 1, Devils 1
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Dave Andreychuk scored on a slap
shot with 1:53 to play in regulation and the Devils continued their
home domination of Montreal by tying the Canadiens.
	   The tie extended the Devils' home unbeaten streak against
Montreal to 11 games (8-0-3) and it extended New Jersey's current
overall run to 11-3-2.
	   The Devils thought they won the game with 1:47 left in overtime
when Jay Pandolfo scored off a pass from Brian Rolston. A review
showed that Pandolfo kicked the puck into the open net.
	   Vladimir Malakhov had given Montreal the lead late in the second
period with a rising slap shot from straight on that Martin Brodeur
never had a chance to stop.
 &UR; Hurricanes 3, Penguins 3
	   In Greensboro, North Carolina, Dan Kesa scored his first goal of
the season with 10:35 left as the Pittsburgh Penguins rallied for a
tie to snap the Carolina Hurricanes' season-high four-game winning
streak.
	   The Penguins, who were 6-0 against Carolina last season,
improved to 8-0-3 against the Hurricanes in their last 11 games.
	   Kesa's third career goal was set up with a perfect centering
pass to the slot by Martin Straka. Kesa, once a minor leaguer in
the former Hartford Whalers organization in the mid-1990s, easily
beat Arturs Irbe with his onetimer.
 &UR; Capitals 5, Islanders 1
	   In Washington, the Capitals broke a three-game losing streak
with a four-goal, third-period burst.
	   Rick Tabaracci made 22 saves, including one on a penalty shot,
for his first victory this season. Coach Ron Wilson started
Tabaracci ahead of Olaf Kolzig, who has struggled along with the
rest of the team.
	   The Capitals scored four goals on five shots in the third,
including the first two shorthanded goals allowed this season by
the Islanders, who have the league's top power-play unit. Calle
Johansson scored back-to-back to break a 1-1 tie, and Peter Bondra
and Steve Konowalchuk followed with goals 52 seconds apart on the
same Islanders power play.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ After slashing his wrist and taking an
apparent drug overdose, the man suspected of mailing out 28
potentially lethal letter bombs was charged Saturday at his
hospital bedside.
	   A magistrate briefly visited Colin George Dunstan, 43, a
disgruntled ex-Australian Tax Office employee, at Canberra Hospital
to charge him with one count of damaging property with an explosive
device, with intent to endanger life.
	   This relates to the explosion of a letter bomb Wednesday at the
Canberra mail sorting center, which slightly injured two postal
workers who were hit by bits of plastic shrapnel.
	   The magistrate ordered Dunstan to appear in court on Tuesday.
	   The owner of a Canberra suburban Budget Motel found Dunstan, who
had checked in Tuesday under a false name, sitting in the lobby
bleeding from one
	   wrist and dazed by an apparent drug overdose on Friday
afternoon.
	   The motel owner, Les McCabe, drove Dunstan to the Canberra
Hospital emergency ward, where police soon arrived to arrest the
man they had been seeking nationwide since Tuesday.
	   McCabe, 63, said he had been too busy with his motel work to
watch TV or read the papers, so he was unaware that one of his
guests was the most wanted
	   fugitive in the nation.
	   Dunstan had been on leave from the Australian Tax Office after
having an affair with a married woman co-worker in 1990 and 1991.
According to documents Dunstan later filed to sexual harassment
authorities and the Federal Court, the woman ended the affair, and
then alternatively tried to resume it and castigated him for only
wanting her sexually.
	   Dunstan blamed this episode for the breakup of his own marriage
in 1992; he took an overdose of pills at that time.
	   He apparently also blamed the tax office and various human
rights and equal opportunity officials for his troubles; the 28
letter bombs found so far were all addressed to such authorities.
	   The last bomb was found at a Sydney home Friday. They were all
mailed in small plastic boxes of the type used to ship five
computer diskettes.
	   Police told the magistrate Saturday that a search of Dunstan's
home had revealed bomb related items and documentation relating to
people to whom other explosive devices were sent.
	   One item located was a detonated explosive device with items
similar to that which detonated at the mail exchange.
	   On Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, while Dunstan was still at
large, Australia was gripped by panic over urban terrorism. Various
government and tax offices in Sydney Melbourne and Darwin closed
while suspicious packages were investigated, all false alarms.
	   A Sydney-to-Melbourne train was halted and evacuated Friday,
also a false
	   alarm.
	   ``It's a reminder that that kind of urban terrorism, I suppose,
is a modern day reality in every society,'' Prime Minister John
Howard said Friday on Melbourne Radio station 3AW. ``We've been
refreshingly freer of it than most other societies and I hope that
continues to be the case.''

	   COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) _ Josh Davis of Texas Aquatics set
his third American record in three days in winning the short course
200-meter freestyle in 1 minute, 45.24 seconds Friday at the U.S.
Open.
	   Davis' first record came in the 100 individual medley at the
FINA Swimming World Cup on Wednesday, then he came back and set the
record in the 200 IM at the U.S. Open on Thursday.
	   The triple gold medalist from the 1996 Olympics swam 21 races in
four days.
	   ``This is more than I could ever hope for, to get three American
records,'' he said.
	   Natalie Coughlin, 16, of Terrapins Swim Team was the only double
winner Friday with victories in the women's 100 backstroke (58.59)
and 400 IM (4:36.24).

Gordon and Rainbow Warriors honored
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The NASCAR awards banquet Friday night was a
rainbow-colored affair for the fourth straight year, thanks to Jeff
Gordon and the Hendrick Racing team.
	   Gordon's team, known as the Rainbow Warriors thanks to the
multi-colored logo of primary sponsor DuPont, garnered most of the
accolades and most of the money handed out during the ceremony in
the grand ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.
	   It was the fourth straight Winston Cup championship for the team
owned by Rick Hendrick and currently run by younger brother John.
Gordon has won titles in 1995, 1997 and 1998, while teammate Terry
Labonte beat out the younger driver for the championship in 1996.
	   On the way to this latest title, the 27-year-old Gordon _ the
youngest three-time champion in NASCAR's 50 years _ matched
modern-era records with four consecutive wins and a total of 13
victories. In a 33-race season, The Kid had one stretch of 17
consecutive top-5 finishes, coming within one race of David
Pearson's record in that category.
	   For his efforts, Gordon won a record dlrs 9,306,584, including
dlrs 6,175,867 in race winnings and dlrs 2,632,272 in Winston Cup
awards.
	   He held the previous record of 6,375,658.
	   ``I guess that just shows what kind of year it's been,'' Gordon
said.
	   Asked how this season stacks up with his other two championship
seasons, Gordon noted, ``Years like this only come around once in a
great while and we're going to enjoy each and every one of them.''
	   Gordon gave plenty of credit for his success to his team, but
particularly to crew chief Ray Evernham, who has shared the stage
with the youngster after each of his titles.
	   Evernham pointed out the rest of the championship team sits in
the second balcony of the Waldorf ballroom each year.
	   ``NASCAR has really, really become a team sport,'' he said.
``Each year at this banquet, I look up to the Rainbow Warriors
sitting upstairs. But I look up to them all year long. It's those
guys who get us here.''
	   For the third year in a row, Rick Hendrick was unable to attend
the dinner.
	   The owner, battling leukemia, also is serving out a year's
suspension from operating either his race team or his chain of car
dealerships stemming from a conviction for mail fraud.
	   Hendrick pleaded guilty to that charge in exchange for dismissal
of a conspiracy charge and 13 counts of money laundering related to
the operation of his Honda dealerships. He was also fined dlrs
250,000.
	   If his health allows, Rick Hendrick will be allowed to resume
control of the race team prior to the season-opening Daytona 500 on
Feb. 14.
	   Other awards Friday night included dlrs 25,000 to Kenny Irwin
for winning the rookie of the year title and dlrs 25,000 to Kyle
Petty as the True Value Man of the Year.

	   Not included in the surrender deal, however, were the Khmer
Rouge's three top surviving leaders, Tak Mok, Khieu Samphan and
Nuon Chea. Pol Pot died in April this year.
	   The Cambodian government and the United States have expressed a
desire to capture all three and make them stand trial for genocide
and crimes against humanity.
	   Khem Nuon, Ta Mok's chief of staff who negotiated the surrender
with government officials, said simply, they are ``retired'' and
are not part of the deal.
	   He refused to go into details about them, Thayer said.
	   Khem Nuon claimed he was negotiating on behalf of 5,000
remaining ragtag troops and 15,000 civilians living under Khmer
Rouge control.
	   Thayer said, however, that he believed the estimate of fighting
men was inflated, and that many of the civilians are living in the
Phu Noi refugee camp in Thailand.
	   ``There must be unity. There is no other way. There is no way
for a military solution. No weapons. Only political struggle,''
Thayer said Khem Nuon told him in a telephone interview.
	   The government was represented at the negotiations by Meas
Sopheas, deputy chief of staff of the Cambodian military.
	   Under the agreement, the remaining guerillas will join the
government army and the civilians will return to Anlong Veng, the
guerrillas' former stronghold in the north.

Seven children die of malnutrition in Sumatra: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ At least seven children under the age
of five have died in West Sumatra of malnutrition brought on by
Indonesia's severe economic crisis, a report said Saturday.
	   Fourty-one children were hospitalized in the past ten months for
malnutrition in the province, the daily Kompas said.
	   About 160,000, or 40 percent of the 400,000 under-five children,
could starve, it said, quoting Rasyidah, a social affairs officer
in the provincial capital of Padang.
	   Rasyidah warned that immediate steps should be taken in order to
prevent the situation from causing brain damage in the children.
	   Indonesia in now facing its worst economic crisis in three
decades, and food prices, unemployment and poverty rates are
soaring.
	   UNICEF's representative in Indonesia, Stephen Woodhouse, has
also warned that chronic malnutrition among the children could lead
to ``a lost generation.''
	   He estimated that 50 percent of Indonesian children below the
age of 2 were in danger of losing 10 to 15 IQ points because of
inadequate nutrition.

sentence &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Reputed Hong Kong crime boss Cheung Tze-keung
lost his appeal on Saturday to stave off a death sentence for
gunrunning, kidnapping, and armed robbery, government radio
reported.
	   Cheung, alias ``Big Spender,'' and four others lost their appeal
against a death sentence handed down last month in a court hearing
that lasted an hour and a half, Radio Hong Kong reported.
	   Two others were given suspended death sentences, the radio
added, without giving further details.
	   Only Cheung's lawyer and some of his relatives were allowed
inside the mainland court 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of the
border. The hearing was conducted amid heightened security, the
radio said.
	   An official at the Guangdong Higher People's Court, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, would not comment on Cheung's case.
	   Cheung had fulfilled his last wish to see his two sons on
Friday. After a 30-minute meeting with his four- and seven-year old
sons, Cheung told his father-in-law: ``Take care of my boys,'' the
South China Morning Post reported.
	   Cheung and 35 accomplices were tried behind closed doors last
month for sensational crimes including smuggling of dynamite and
guns from China into Hong Kong, armed robbery, and theft of 277
tons of steel.
	   The case riveted attention in Hong Kong, where two tycoons
reportedly were kidnapped and released only after the payment of
some U.S. dlrs 210 million in ransom.
	   Legal experts raised questions about the jurisdiction, noting
that some crimes committed in Hong Kong, which does not execute
people, were prosecuted in China as capital offenses in a trial
that had been closed to reporters.
	   ``The mainland does not place the same emphasis on the rights of
defendants as Hong Kong,'' the South China Morning Post said in an
editorial Saturday.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The last main fighting force of the
Khmer Rouge, the radical Marxist guerrillas who killed nearly two
million Cambodians, have surrendered to the government, a
journalist close to the rebels said on Saturday.
	   Negotiators for the last band of guerrillas holed up near the
Thai border met Friday with representatives of the government in
Phnom Penh at Preah Vihear temple at the northern edge of Cambodia
and agreed to lay down their arms, according to Nate Thayer of the
Far Eastern Economic Review.
	   In 1997, Thayer became the first journalist allowed to interview
the Khmer Rouge's late leader Pol Pot, who had not been seen in
public in nearly two decades. He is one of very few outsiders
trusted by the guerrillas.
	   The surrender of the Khmer Rouge brings to an end more than 30
years of civil war in Cambodia that began with the Marxist
guerrilla's insurgency against the government in Phnom Penh in the
late 1960s.
	   Not included in the surrender deal, however, were the Khmer
Rouge's three top surviving leaders, Tak Mok, Khieu Samphan and
Nuon Chea. Pol Pot died in April this year.
	   The Cambodian government and the United States has expressed a
desire to capture all three and make them stand trial for genocide
and crimes against humanity.
	   Khem Nuon, Ta Mok's chief of staff who negotiated the surrender
with government officials, said simply, they are ``retired'' and
are not part of the deal.
	   He refused to go into details about them, Thayer said.
	   Khem Nuon claimed he was negotiating on behalf of 5,000
remaining ragtag troops and 15,000 civilians living under Khmer
Rouge control.
	   Thayer said, however, that he believed the estimate of fighting
men was inflated, and that many of the civilians are living in the
Phu Noi refugee camp in Thailand.
	   ``There must be unity. There is no other way. There is no way
for a military solution. No weapons. Only political struggle,''
Thayer said Khem Nuon told him in a telephone interview.
	   The government was represented at the negotiations by Meas
Sopheas, deputy chief of staff of the Cambodian military.
	   Under the agreement, the remaining guerrillas will join the
government army and the civilians will return to Anlong Veng, the
guerrillas' former stronghold in the north.
	   While it is possible there are some tiny bands of guerrillas
still wandering the jungles, Thayer said he knew of no sizable
Khmer Rouge fighting force that could pose a viable threat to the
government.
	   The surrender comes less than a month after Cambodian strongman
Hun Sen and Prince Norodom Ranariddh, whom he ousted as co-prime
minister in a bloody 1997 coup, struck their own deal to end the
country's deadlocked political conflict and form a working

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ After slashing his wrist and taking an
apparent drug overdose, the man suspected of mailing 28 potentially
lethal letter bombs was charged Saturday at his hospital bedside.
	   A magistrate briefly visited Colin George Dunstan, 43, a
disgruntled ex-Australian Tax Office employee, at Canberra Hospital
to charge him with one count of damaging property with an explosive
device, with intent to endanger life.
	   This relates to the explosion of a letter bomb Wednesday at the
Canberra mail sorting center, which slightly injured two postal
workers who were hit by bits of plastic shrapnel.
	   The magistrate ordered Dunstan to appear in court on Tuesday.
	   The owner of a Canberra suburban Budget Motel found Dunstan, who
had checked in Tuesday under a false name, sitting in the lobby
bleeding from one wrist and dazed by an apparent drug overdose on
Friday afternoon.
	   The motel owner, Les McCabe, drove Dunstan to the Canberra
Hospital emergency ward, where police soon arrived to arrest the
man they had been seeking nationwide since Tuesday.
	   McCabe, 63, said he had been too busy with his motel work to
watch TV or read the papers, so he was unaware that one of his
guests was the most wanted fugitive in the nation.
	   Dunstan had been on leave from the Australian Tax Office after
having an affair with a married woman co-worker in 1990 and 1991.
In a document filed to sexual harassment authorities and the
Federal Court, Dunstan claimed the woman ended the affair, then
tried to resume it and castigated him for only wanting her
sexually.
	   Dunstan blamed this episode for the breakup of his own marriage
in 1992; he also took an overdose of pills at that time.
	   He apparently also blamed the tax office and various human
rights and equal opportunity officials for his troubles; the 28
letter bombs found so far were all addressed to such authorities.
	   The last bomb was found at a Sydney home Friday. They were all
mailed in small plastic boxes of the type used to ship five
computer diskettes.
	   Police told the magistrate Saturday that a search of Dunstan's
home had revealed bomb related items and documentation relating to
people to whom other explosive devices were sent.
	   One item located was a detonated explosive device with items
similar to that which detonated at the mail exchange.
	   On Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, while Dunstan was still at
large, Australia was gripped by panic over urban terrorism. Various
government and tax offices in Sydney Melbourne and Darwin closed
while suspicious packages were investigated, all false alarms.
	   A Sydney-to-Melbourne train was halted and evacuated Friday,
also a false alarm.
	   ``It's a reminder that that kind of urban terrorism, I suppose,
is a modern day reality in every society,'' Prime Minister John
Howard said Friday on Melbourne Radio station 3AW. ``We've been
refreshingly freer of it than most other societies and I hope that
continues to be the case.''

Vietnam pushing for Cambodia's admission to ASEAN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam, host of the sixth ASEAN summit
later this month, is pushing hard for Cambodia's admission into the
nine-nation organization.
	   ``Vietnam has been trying its best to reach consensus among
ASEAN member countries on admission of Cambodia before or at the
summit in Hanoi in the interests of peace, stability and
development in the region,'' Prime Minister Phan Van Khai said in a
statement.
	   The statement, issued Friday and published in the Nhan Dan
newspaper Saturday, was in response to a letter Wednesday from
Cambodia's King Sihanouk asking Association of Southeast Asian
Nations to consider its application.
	   Khai said Vietnam has always supported Cambodia's admission and
that the conditions are ripe following the recent establishment of
a legitimate government in its long-troubled neighbor.
	   ``The implementation of ASEAN founders' dream of ASEAN-10 is of
strategic importance and in accordance with the interests of ASEAN
and Cambodia,'' Khai said.
	   Some ASEAN countries have cited political instability in
Cambodia as the reason for withholding its membership.

</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Taiwan's citizens voted Saturday in national and local
elections. Here are some facts and figures about the island, its
politics and people:
	   ELECTIONS _ Taiwanese got to choose a new Legislature that is
being expanded to 225 seats, with 176 elected directly and the rest
allocated to parties depending on their popular support. Voters
also decided races for the mayors and city councils of Taiwan's two
largest cities, Taipei and Kaohsiung.
	   Nearly 15 million people aged 20 or above were eligible to vote,
with some 2.86 million eligible in the mayoral races.
	   BACKGROUND _ Taiwan is the seat of the Nationalist government
that fled the Communist takeover of mainland China in 1949. Taiwan
calls itself the Republic of China. Mainland China regards the
island as a renegade province with no right to sovereignty.
Taiwan's government maintains both sides should recognize that
China is divided and strive for its reunification.
	   GOVERNMENT and POLITICS _ The Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang,
ruled China from 1911 to 1949 but has been in charge only of Taiwan
since then. The party governed by martial law until 1987 when it
began a process of democratization. The Nationalist grip on power
has loosened under a multiparty system.
	   GEOGRAPHY and HISTORY _ Taiwan and its smaller islands have a
land area of 14,384 square miles (36,823 square kms) and a tropical
climate. Taiwan is separated from the Chinese mainland by the
Taiwan Strait, about 80 miles (130 kms) wide. Of the population of
21.8 million, 85 percent are native-born. Most of the rest are
Chinese who fled the mainland in 1949.
	   Japan ruled Taiwan as a colony from 1895 to 1945. China was
given control after World War II.
	   Taiwan shunned contact with the mainland from 1949 to the late
1980s, when a ban on trade and travel was lifted. Most nations,
including the United States, extend diplomatic recognition to
Beijing instead of Taiwan. Only 27 countries have diplomatic
relations with Taiwan.
	   ECONOMY _ Exports are Taiwan's economic backbone, with products
including foods, textiles, leather, machinery and electronics.
Chief markets are the United States, China and Europe. Taiwan has
one of the world's largest foreign currency reserves, totaling U.S.
dlrs 88 billion.

More than 17,000 people ill after flood
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A variety of illnesses have affected
17,000 people in Danang as the result of recent flooding, the
city's health department said Saturday.
	   It said 9,000 people suffered from eye infections, 4,000 got
colds, 2,400 suffered diarrhea and 2,000 contracted from foot
sores. All have been treated, the department said, adding there is
no sign of any epidemic.
	   The department also has provided chemicals to local residents to
purify more than 6,000 wells contaminated during last month's
flooding.
	   No overall statistics were available on the number of people who
became ill in the 12 flood-affected provinces.
	   Large sections of Danang were under water for more than a week
in what has been described as the worst flooding since 1964.
Thirty-two people died in the city.
	   Meanwhile, the city's floods and storms control committee said a
dam which supplies water for more than 10,000 hectares (25,000
acres) of rice broke Wednesday.
	   No casualties have been reported, but the rice paddies are
expected to suffer from water shortages during the dry season
starting in March.
	   A series of three floods last month in 12 central provinces left
267 people dead and caused dlrs 90 million in damage, a huge amount
for one of Vietnam's poorest regions.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung on Thursday signed a
decision to provide 28 billion dong (dlrs 2 million) in emergency
aid, 50 billion dong (dlrs 3.6 million) for restoration of the
transport network and 18 billion dong (dlrs 1.3 million) for the
repair of irrigation systems.
	   The government has also pledged 400 billion dong (dlrs 29
million) in preferential loans to the affected provinces.

China closing down polluters near Three Gorges Dam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China will shut 50 more factories along the
Yangtze River to boost environmental protection around the world's
largest hydroelectric project, state media reported Saturday.
	   More than 150 paper mills and tanneries have already been closed
in hopes of stopping ecological degradation around the Three Gorges
Dam site, the Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   Environmental officials in Chonqing, the sprawling city that
will sit at the head of the dam's reservoir, said the 50 cement
plants will be closed because they ``have caused serious air
pollution and water quality problems'' Xinhua reported.
	   An unnamed official cited by the news agency said any other
polluters will be shut down ``without hesitation.''
	   When the dam is completed in 2009, more than 80 percent of the
mammoth reservoir lies within the Chongqing area, now China's
largest municipality.
	   Chinese leaders are determined to see the 203.4 billion yuan
(dlrs 24.6 billion) dam succeed despite criticism by
environmentalists and human rights groups that it is too costly and
too intrusive for forcing the relocation of a million people.
	   China's legislature, the National People's Congress, has already
called for areas in the Yangtze basin to step up efforts to reduce
soil erosion, which was exacerbated by this summer's heavy
flooding, the China Daily reported Saturday.
	   In a separate effort to clean up polluted Lake Tai in East
China, the State Environmental Protection Administration opened
hotlines this week to field a slew of public complaints about
environmental mismanagement, China Daily said.
	   Local residents complained one factory was dumping tons of
untreated waste into the lake, and an electronics plants, located
beside a kindergarten playground, has been emitting toxic gases,
the newspaper said.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The last main fighting force of the
Khmer Rouge, the radical Marxist guerrillas who killed nearly two
million Cambodians, have surrendered to the government, a

	   Negotiators for the remaining band of guerrillas holed up near

Sopheas, deputy chief of staff of the Cambodian military.
	   Under the agreement, the remaining guerrillas will join the
government army and the civilians will return to Anlong Veng, the
guerrillas' former stronghold in the north.
	   While it is possible there are some tiny bands of guerrillas
still wandering the jungles, Thayer said he knew of no sizable
Khmer Rouge fighting force that could pose a viable threat to the
government.
	   The surrender comes less than a month after Cambodian strongman
Hun Sen and Prince Norodom Ranariddh, whom he ousted as co-prime
minister in a bloody 1997 coup, struck their own deal to end the
country's deadlocked political conflict and form a working
government.
	   With the Khmer Rouge laying down their arms and Hun Sen and
Ranariddh working together, the country is poised to begin perhaps
its most stable period in decades.
	   The Khmer Rouge came to power in April 1975 by overthrowing the
	   U.S.-backed Lon Nol government.
	   Under the leadership of Pol Pot, they emptied out the cities and
attempted to turn the country into an agrarian utopia by herding
the population on to collective farms.
	   The experiment was a disaster economically and in human terms.
Famine soon affected many parts of the country. Those suspected of
harboring opposing views, or merely of being educated, were put to
death.
	   Nearly two million people died of execution, overwork,
starvation or disease under the Khmer Rouge until they were ousted
from power by a Vietnamese invasion in 1979.
	   They fought a guerrilla war against successive governments ever
since, but wings of their movement began defecting to the
government starting in 1996, leaving only the hardliners in the
north left carrying on their struggle.
	   That struggle ended Friday.

Unknown illness kills five in central Vietnam

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ An unknown illness has killed five people
and left 34 others sick in central Vietnam, local health officials
said Saturday.
	   All of the fatalities have occurred over the past week in Suoi
Da village, in the Van Canh district of Binh Dinh province, a
district hospital official said, adding that five other people are
in critical condition.
	   Symptoms include headache, chest pain, vomiting and coma, she
said.
	   Nguyen Thanh Binh, director of the provincial health department,
said a team from the provincial hospital has been sent to the
district clinic to help, but no cause of death has been determined.
	   Samples from autopsies of two victims have been sent for
examination at a laboratory in neighboring Nha Trang city, she
said.
	   The Van Canh district hospital official said some villagers have
fled their homes, fearing the disease will spread. But the
migration has stopped since local authorities persuaded villagers
not to flee.
	   It is uncertain whether the disease is related to contaminated
water as the result of flooding two weeks ago which killed 14
people in the province.
